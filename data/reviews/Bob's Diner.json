{"text":"I'm sure that people who want to pig out like this place. However, if you wanted to choose a healthy option, e.g., egg whites, don't be surprised if it's dripping with butter. Probably 1/4 a stick with every meal."}
{"text":"Service is decent food could be better. $1 per slice of bacon side order is pretty step. Restaurant cleanliness is lacking as well. Looks like stuff that's been on the floor for the last few days. Most likely won't be going back unless I hear things have improved."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast today and there were a handful of other customers and plenty of dirty tables. After receiving our food we were not acknowledged by our waitress or any waitress for over 20 minutes. But they had enough time to talk about the blueberry bread for French toast and how the cook did it so creatively. Which must be where his main focus was on cooking because the \"fresh\" fruit cup had barely any fruit and definitely was NOT fresh. The sausage gravy wouldn't have been bad had they not drowned it in salt. Definitely not going back or recommending it to anyone. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I look forward to going to Bob's every Sunday for breakfast. I've been to them all more than once, but typically go to the one in Imperial. The menu has anything you could want and the food is good and you get plenty of it! I can never come close to finishing my plate. I'd definitely recommend their french toast, but get it ala cart because you get three HUGE pieces when you order it  as a meal. The service is always a pleasant fast experience. I like that its family owned and operated and I always hear about how Bob Marshall is a very very nice guy. Good luck to Bob with opening more locations!"}
{"text":"The parking lot is a mess for starters.  We had to wait for a seat but that's expected on a Sunday morning.  We were then seated at a table in the very back directly across from the bathrooms...appetizing!  In all fairness she asked if that was ok but we were hungry and had our infant with us so we said ok- the point here is that there shouldn't be a table there to begin with! 

Took 10 min to get greeted and 20 min for our food.  Although busy, the allure of a diner is the quick service and cheap prices- which were NOT cheap!  It was nearly $9 for an omelet with any cheese and 2 choices of veggies or meat.  Each additional option was 50 cents.  If you wanted a western it was nearly $10! I think this is a lot compare to other diners like Toms in dormont.  

After waiting for what felt like forever, the food was really good.  The turkey sausage was really salty though and they only gave a tiny cup of syrup for the pancake, which was luke warm.  

We might try this one more time but not for a while.  Let them work out the kinks!"}
{"text":"After looking for somewhere to have breakfast this past Sunday, I remembered that Bob's Diner had opened right down the road from me.  When we walked in it was a much better looking restaurant that used to be there. It was bright and clean. It was crowded, but the wait was short. After we were seated, the service was good and our orders were taken. Our drinks were kept full and our food arrived shortly after ordering. I had the sausage gravy and biscuits with home fries plus a pancake to share, and my girl had the mixed grill. The mixed grill looked good, but based on the description I was a bit disappointed with the size. The biscuits and gravy and pancake  looked good, but the portion of potatoes was very small. As we both started to eat, I realized that my pancake, biscuits and gravy, and potatoes were all luke warm at best and didn't taste very good because they weren't hot. Cold sausage gravy is awful! I told the waitress and she apologized and told me that she would have them remake my order. At least I could be sure they weren't just throwing it in the microwave! My girlfriend continued to eat (and share) her meal that was tasty. It took a little while, but my new order came out and I was happy that I was going to have my breakfast. Unfortunately it was not any warmer than the first one that they served me. None of it!  I told my waitress and could see just how frustrated she was. She apologized many times and said that she would remove the charge for my breakfast from our bill. She did so, and the manager came over and apologized as well. She even offered up a 5 dollar coupon for another visit. After paying my bill, we decided to use our 5 bucks on a slice of apple pie for later on. It was decent. Based on my experience, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back to a Bob's. There are plenty of other breakfast options in the area that I would rather try for a first time or return to."}
{"text":"Ordered Corned Beef Hash with eggs, potatoes and toast.  Good food, good value.  Nice family style restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Bob's, and were anxious to try something new. The staff seemed friendly, and the place looked clean. Unfortunately, the food was rather overpriced. I opted for a Belgian waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. There were MAYBE four strawberries and no whipped cream. The waitress was kind enough to add the whipped cream and bring a second cup of syrup ( One isn't enough). The coffee was rather weak, but that can be a personal preference. The wife, when seeing the prices, pulled back on her order. Still, the bill ended up being about $20 for the two of us. Not worth it, in my book."}
{"text":"Bob's in Carnegie has horrible service. We eat here a lot, probably won't any more. Stopped by the other night for something quick. The girl seated us and brought our drinks. After waiting 15 minutes, no server came by our table, we left. Told the girl that seated us we never got waited on, her reply was \"really\".
It's a shame this location has such bad service, the other,locations are way better.
I am not basing my opinion on this one bad experience, have been going to this location since it opened. Have had many dinners accompanied by really bad service.
Unfortunately, this one will be the last one for me."}
{"text":"Great joint for breakfast. Huge hangover killin' pancakes! And the best French toast I've had since '99."}
{"text":"Food is good and supper clean.  A little wore in places but not grimy. 

The service was a prompt and friendly.  Slightly rushed but okay."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Bob's about 5:30 last night. Walked in to an almost empty restaurant...bad sign. One person ordered a Belgian waffle (after being told that breakfast was served all day). The waitress returned to tell us that the waffle iron had been turned off at 2:00. Another person ordered a fish sandwich. Again the waitress returned to say that no one had bothered to bread the fish that day. So there was no fish.I ordered a \"Rachel\"...turkey, Russian dressing, cole slaw. The sandwich was so soggy that it could have floated away. I did not eat even half of it.The pickle on the side had seen better days. My husband ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich. The tomato slice on the sandwich was face down. When it was turned over it was black and not edible. 

The meals are not inexpensive. Our bill for two sandwiches amounted to $20 plus a tip. It will be a long time before we return. Fortunately, Carnegie patrons have some new restaurants from which to choose."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with a guest. The place was quite full, got a table and server came quickly. She was great, had a sense of humor. The coffee at their place is very nice.  The service wonderful, plenty of quantity and of good quality as well. I would come here again."}
{"text":"If you want classic diner food at a local restaurant then this place is for you.  It is relatively small and doesn't look like much, the food is what you would hope for and the service was attentive and friendly.  This is a great option for those who avoid chain restaurants.  

NOTE:  The directions from yelp were incorrect although they got me in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Dirty place!  There was 5 of us for breakfast and our food took so long to come out!  Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"At first I thought Bobs was awesome. But the last couple times I ate there I was disappointed. The service was slow. The place is in need of a good cleaning and paint job. As far as the food they never cook the home fries completely. Sorry but raw potatoes are not good for any meal. I still gave them 3 stars because they can be good at times depending how busy they are and who on the grill."}
{"text":"NICE CASUAL ATMOSPHERE, clean and good diner food. i love the Mancini's bread and good coffee."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! We used to be regulars at Pamela's and now have switched to bobs, the service is great, everyone who works here is extremely kind and friendly. Not only that but bob himself regularly walks around talking to the customers which shows how much he really cares. The food is amazing too! The banana stuffed French toast can't be beat! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. We live nearby and were hoping for a place we could make a regular spot. Went for lunch on opening day hopeful, but left disappointed. I had a cheeseburger and onion rings. The cheeseburger was cooked well, but was too greasy and the bun falling apart, the onion rings were pretty good. My lunch companion had French toast, thick Mancinis bread and it was ok but the bread was so thick it was just warm doughy in the center, and the side of homegrown potatoes had hair(s) on them. 
The waitress was apologetic and took them off the bill.  As for the atmosphere, it did not look like much had changed from the previous place, the carpet was dirty, the booths were big enough but the vinyl covering was peeling or missing from some seats.  Needless to say, won't be going back"}
{"text":"Food is ok I had the mixed grill breakfast. My food had little flavor and was a little over cooked.  The coffee is gross.  I don't think I would ever go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I had a double burger with chips.  I really liked it.  My dad had a hot roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes.  He said he would give this a 2, but not me.  Place was small, bathroom not the greatest, not crowded, I would go back."}
{"text":"Terrific breakfast spot.  The food is good and the service better.  {Ask for Janet.}   I love all of Bob's fabulous diners, but this one is particularly special.   Very warm.  Cozy.  Unpretentious.  Lifted from a Richard Russo novel."}
{"text":"Bobs dinner was a very good place to eat in Pittsburgh but in the recent years it has been slacking. One reason is the service about 3 years ago you would get free refills but now you have to pay 2 dollars for one. Another way is the food I went there one day and I got a waffle and it tasted bad. The sever said we put it in a box we will get you another one. I got the other one and it still tasted bad. So you can see bobs dinner was good but now it's bad."}
{"text":"My dad has been coming to this location for about three months for breakfast. Averages about three days a week. He has brought mom, aunt Jamie and uncle Matt, aunt Jill, uncle Ramzey and my other uncle Matthew. They all said it was awesome.

From the coffee to the chunky home fries, he has yet to find ANYTHING less than above average with most of it outstanding. 

He highly recommends the breakfast burrito, the pancakes, Eggs \"Benny\", Begin waffle, omelette (if you wan the old fashioned - not so darn fluffy style) and definitely don't pass on some of the best coffee in the area. 

Staff incredibly friendly and efficient. Dad loves a server who remembers his pickle allergy.

Dad tells me Bob's on Painters Run is easy to pass by without noticing it in the car, but once you visit, you'll never pass it up again!"}
{"text":"I resisted going to Bob's for awhile, despite its convenient location, because I really hate Tom's and I was sure Bob's would be just as bad. 

I was so wrong! I always get breakfast, no matter what time of day I go there, so my review is limited to that. 

I totally love Bob's. It's my new go-to joint. The waitresses are charming and good at their jobs, the place has a nice mellow vibe even when it's busy, and the breakfasts are fantastic. Totally good diner food. I get omelettes a lot, and the breakfast sandwich, and eggs Benedict. All fab. 

Totally recommend it if you're looking for a funky diner with satisfying breakfast options."}
{"text":"People and place are nice. I think the acid test of any diner is a good hot roast beef sandwich with gravy. Ordered one and it was anything but hot. Also the roast beef was too rare and turned the bread into a slimy pink mess. Very off putting. Fries were average and gravy was obviously not homemade. Came out of a can or something. Not an impressive selection of pies and cakes. Do yourself a favor and hit Jim and Lou Lou's instead. They make everything fresh as its ordered."}
{"text":"A couple of days ago my family and I ate at Bobs Diner in McKees Rock, and so very happy we did. The food, service and atmosphere was super!!  The pancakes the best we have ever eaten, French toast was yummy, the burrito was the bomb!!  And plentiful!!  You will not leave hungry. Dawn our waitress was so attentive, she and the whole staff there were busy, and they all worked great together. Not a booth or table empty, says a lot about Bobs, and customers waiting at the door!!  Prices reasonable, restaurant very sunny, bright and very clean. Beats any other breakfast place to eat. Will go back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Bob's is a great little breakfast spot. They are always busy but the waitstaff is never flustered or overwhelmed. We were here this morning and I have a breakfast burrito. I have never done the whole breakfast burrito thing before but it spoke to me today. I got it with bacon and it was divine. If I ever got it again I'd definitely have it as a brunch instead of a breakfast though. It's been almost seven hours and I'm still full.  Bob's makes great omelets too. Good food, good sized portions, good atmosphere. Great little diner! I highly recommend. It's kind of off the beaten track but it's right near Ohio Valley General Hospital. Seems like the staff from the hospital come over to Bob's pretty regularly. I've never done lunch here but the breakfast is really perfect if you are looking for diner food."}
{"text":"I grew up in Eastern PA and NJ and appreciate good diner food.  My wife and I stopped in for lunch recently.  I had a patty melt and my wife had Dad's favorite.  
They were not super busy but the service from the start, was exceptional.  Our waiter, Garland is someone you should experience in your lifetime.  Trust me, you'll thank me.  The owner, Bob stopped by twice to check our level of satisfaction.  Our food, service and experience was very good and we'll be back to try breakfast and dinner.  Happy dining my Friends!"}
{"text":"Parking is narrow, as another yelper previously wrote. The raisin French Toast was awesome according to
My daughter. My omelette consisted of burnt eggs. The coffee was warm, not hot. My husband gets the breakfast sandwich with ham, always, and the ham was like lunch meat, not the thick ham served at the Carnegie location. The inside is nice and new, but the food is much less to be desired. We will be going back to the Carnegie location from now on."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly, as you can see by my number of check ins here. This doesn't include the times I just forget to check in lol. I love seeing regular faces here. The home fries are almost as good as Pamela's Diner (in the strip). The breakfast sandwich, however, is my fave!! I actually become sad when it's time to take my last bite. Gotta try this place for breakfast. It's a diner, not a 5 star restaurant. Keep that in mind when visiting. It's not going to have matching linens, plates, and chandeliers, like some people would want. Go to the Grand Concourse for Sunday brunch with Bloody Marys and mimosas. Good home style cooking with good people surrounding you."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time... Granted it's New Year's Day so it was pretty busy. The service was not that good our orders were wrong and the waitress acted like she didn't know what to do when we told her it was wrong..age actually said \"do u just want what's missing on the side Idk what else to do\".  We also then waited 20 minutes for our check."}
{"text":"This is a very good diner spot for breakfast. No frills. Decor is old and used despite being a new location. Food is good diner food. It was spectacular but you get what you pay for. Would definitely go again and gladly pay diner prices to eat here."}
{"text":"Bob's has been such a gem in our neighborhood. We have had nothing but amazing food and great service.  We've had their breakfast and dinner, from a breakfast burrito to the Tuesday turkey dinner, and I am always very happy when I leave. The best thing though is their burgers. Well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and juicy, this is now our go to for a great burger.  We live up the street and have seen restaurant after restaurant come in and leave soon after. We are crossing our fingers that Bob's makes it because they are awesome."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I got the eggs bendict and my husband had the sausage biscuits and sausage. Everything tasted great and fresh. The sausage patty was huge, homemade and delicious! We went Saturday morning so it was crowded but we were seated immediately by a very overworked gentleman. The host clearly needed some help and another waitress would really improve the time waiting. We got our food quickly and thankfully everything was fine as it was because we had to wait a long time to get our check. This is probably my biggest pet peeve when it comes to service. They had run out of silverware and our waitress was either making toast or on her phone for 5 minutes while we waited for the check. I would probably go back again but at off peak times. Great food but the service isn't the best."}
{"text":"I love the breakfasts at Bob's Diner! So do my family. We've been here quite a few times and the portions are huge and so good. Their pancakes are awesome, eggs are always made right, their potatoes are great, and you just can't go wrong. I've never had any of their other foods, but my brother in law got a burger with sweet potato fries last time we were there that he said was fantastic. None of us have ever had bad food or service. Any time people are in the south hills and ask where to go for breakfast or lunch I always recommend this place. It has a lot of parking and you definitely don't leave still hungry."}
{"text":"Usually have good confort food...but last night, not so much. The tomatoes in the salad were dirty, the soup which is usually great, the tortellini was disintegrating. Got the chicken fried steak...which I've had their before and it was excellent, but this time was served with sausage gravy? The mashed potatoes had an unidentified  object that seemed to resemble a watermelon seed. There was one in my potatoes and husbands. At this I point was done."}
{"text":"Tasty classic diner food,  friendly and quick staff.  great prices! Also interesting view of two Onion Dome churches across the street- classic Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Well known for breakfast but.. .Bobs Diner probably has one of the best burgers around.   They are really delicious.. bread-works buns.   Mancinis bread is used for breakfast - which is also a big hit. I am never disappointed. Prices are above average for a diner but its worth it.  Good food and service..  sometimes you gotta treat yourself!!   Find the service is better in the back of the restaurant or at the counter."}
{"text":"Our family of 6 we always get Bob's bountiful breakfast. Eggs. Bacon or sausage. Homefries. And toast. Plenty of food for all. 

Service is always fast, but not always accurate on the order."}
{"text":"My brother took me to this place on our way to visit the Art Museum and I thought it was gonna be gross and unsatisfying but it was awesome! His steak and eggs looked incredible and my ham and egg a la carte was a real generous serving and delicious. I liked the relaxed atmosphere and simple decor. Very enjoyable place with a nice server and I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I go to Bobs every Friday morning right before work. The waitresses are great the food is good except for the bacon way to chewy. The décor. reminds me of being in a class room with all the maps and then there are wine pictures and they don't serve wine, curtains hanging on the walls that remind me of shower curtains, to many mirrors hanging as if I was shopping at a mirror store and the sun when you are sitting in a booth No blinds to block the sun from your eyes. The carpet is dirty the place needs a make over that speaks you are in a diner."}
{"text":"Just ok. Had the fried shrimp, below average same with French fries. The vegetable mix was decent. My husband had the stuffed pork chop, mashed potatoes and gravy. He gave it all a thumbs up. I took a taste of the potatoes and are not fresh but I'm a fan of the box stuff so I agreed they were good. The service was good but it's doubtful that we'll be back"}
{"text":"Love Bob's diner!  Breakfast sausage links are the best in town. Get there early as it gets crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time this morning. Parking lot is small, but who cares? I've never gone to a restaurant to marvel at their parking lot. Now for the stuff that matters, the food. I had the breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg, and cheese and my wife had the banana french toast. Both were awesome! The sandwich was on perfectly toasted Italian bread piled high with eggs, fresh sausage and melty cheese. I got a side of home fries with it and honestly didn't even need to. They were delicious too, but the sandwich was so filling. My wife's french toast was unreal. It was perfectly drizzled with the right amount of syrup and loaded with bananas. I honestly expected it to be way too sweet, but it wasn't by any means. It was just the right amount of sweetness and not overpowering. Also, everyone who works here is super nice and welcoming. This is a really great breakfast spot, and we can't wait to go back for more breakfast and even lunch."}
{"text":"Outstanding service at breakfast by Jody. 
There was no wait but place getting busy for having just opened at 7am. The server had a great greeting. She was fast with drinks. She knew customers by name."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about. Bit overpriced on some items. Wait for food is longer than it should be, may be understaffed in kitchen on Painters Run."}
{"text":"My breakfast was true Pittsburgh comfort food:  chipped ham , a slice of American cheese and scrambled eggs between slices of Italian toast and twice as much as I can eat. And boy can they handle the big Sunday morning crowd efficiently and with a smile. Yeah Bob's Diner"}
{"text":"ok, so its new and curiousity killed the cat.  Well in a nutshell this is as mediocre as it gets.  Low rent restaurant serving low rent food.  Bleeeaach!!

How did this place even get zoning approval with parking for 12 cars and the spaces were designed for Mini-Coopers.  What a mess.

For those of you familiar with the old Skidgys in Mt Lebanon which deservedly went out of business years ago, this is nothing more than a reincarnation only worse.  Eat'n Park would be a 4 star restaurant compared to this place, and I despise Eat'n Park, yuk! 

Portions are horrid, quality and service is below average, metal shavings and green pepper in the coleslaw, food is oily and greasy, 3 green beans a side dish does not make and the beans were raw-hardly cooked, even the rotating dessert case was completely unappetizing, basically I have nothing positive to offer or comment about this place.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect coming to Bob's Diner. I've seen it get packed on certain days but for some reason, I was still hesitant on giving it a try. 

So the menu is quite large and it was hard for me to decide on what to order. My husband and I settled on sausage gravy and biscuits, French toast, and the double dads (which was two eggs, two sausage links, two pieces of bacon, two pancakes, and home fries). The servings are huge! My favorite was the French toast. The slices of bread are thick and fluffy; they almost tasted like doughnuts. Pancakes were ok; they were huge but tasted like bisquick pancakes. Everything else was very satisfying as well. 

Overall, I really enjoyed our brunch here. Definitely see this being a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"My wife and I (with our two sons) went to Bob's Imperial Diner about two weeks ago on a Sunday for breakfast.  The food was pretty good, but the service left a lot to be desired!  My wife and I had Bob's Bountiful Breakfast, my oldest had a chocolate chip pancake and my youngest a muffin.

The food was kinda cold when it came out (probably has been sitting for a while).  We practically had to beg for extra water and rarely saw the waitress.  I would have liked to taste the food while it was hot.

Overall, it wasnt bad, but the service needs work.  There was at least five-six servers for a small resturant and it appeared ours wasnt up to the challenge!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 930 on a Saturday. Don't let the parking lot mislead you. We had no problem getting a table (you will wait for a both though). The waitress in our section was a little busy with a large party so the hostess brought over coffees and menus while we waited. The menu is vast. My husband got the Bountiful Breakfast and I chose My Dad's Favorite. The only complaint was that my husband's eggs were over easy and he ordered over medium well. So they were a little runnier than he usually likes. Other than that, great breakfast. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid option if you are looking for diner food. Traditional breakfast offerings and endless coffee refills in the old school mugs. High quality bacon and toast. Home fries are have a little skin on them and are soft. Low prices and accessible from downtown or suburbs to the west."}
{"text":"Just had a veggie omelette with two link sausage. 14.50$  add a three dollar tip and that's 17.50$ for eggs and sausage?  It was good but kinda 
!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for breakfast after I have drove past several times. Parking was crazy, lot was full. But the food was AWESOME!   I had steak & eggs,s but go to meal for the morning.

3 Eggs and a perfect steak! Very friendly service and a lot of room inside, just had to park a little away, not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"I was anxious for this new location to open in Castle Shannon. It was worth the wait, great service and wonderful food. 

I love the steak & eggs, it's my go to meal. My daughter on the fancy waffles with fresh strawberries and thought it was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, limited parking.  On the day we ate there, both the food and the service were quite good.  The menu is basic, but I'd go there again."}
{"text":"Sunday morning made a trip here. The place has been open a few months. They never painted or cleaned it. Moved right in over dirty walls and carpets.  Our breakfast was OK. The Italian toast was fine, eggs were cold, and bacon was not fresh. It was chewy and not made to order.  We got there at 8:15, how long was that bacon sitting there? There were 4 other tables, so there was no need to mass produce bacon.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever food was terrible way overpriced I couldn't even get napkins on my table for my 3 year old and everybody in the place was so high that they didn't even realize I was standing there to pay my bill for 25 minutes I will never go back to this place"}
{"text":"Three strikes you're out!
This time we had the pancakes and they were gummy, coffee was weak and the price was way to expensive for a breakfast with no meat. We will be eating breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"Perfect way to start a long day of pinball at the PAPA World Pinball Championships down the road.  Pretty much came here every day and it's a diner's diner.  Sometimes they were a bit overwhelmed with how many pinball folks came in each morning but it's got a nice small town vibe and I enjoyed listening to the wait staff gossip :)"}
{"text":"Was here for a Family Gathering in the begging of March !!!   The food was good for a diner but space is limited !!!  
Not a good place for large gatherings !!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, traditional diner in an unusual strip mall with a vast parking lot and only a few stores. 

I came in for breakfast and sat at the counter. The counter is really nice to sit at because the kitchen is right behind it, so you can watch the cook preparing meals while you wait for your food. There are also tables on the side and in the back. 

Service was as real friendly and quick. I had a basic egg breakfast. The eggs were prepared fine and the sausage links were a little bigger than average. 

This is a good place for a quick meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Bob's which I've always been a fan of but I think this is it for me.  Dinner was good, service was great until I got home and wanted to eat my leftover chipped ham sandwich.   It was then that I realized that the kind waitress who offered to box my leftovers also gave me the wrong food.  So I will be returning to Bob's in the morning to pick up my complimentary replacement meal and a sincere apology for another disappointment courtesy of Bob's.   Never again."}
{"text":"This is a diner in a rundown area of Pittsburgh. If you are expecting five star quality then you had better go to a five star establishment. I wish I could give it more than two stars but the inconsistency in the preparation of the food (same item prepared different every time) and the Walmart type atmosphere make it hard to do so. The food, service and price is exactly as what should be expected. The food is decent but nothing remarkable. The service is what it is. Overall there is no reason to cross this place off your list. You will find something you can live with. The food arrives fairly fast. The price is not out of line with other restaurants of this caliber. The bottom line is Bob's will not be your \" go to\" place but it is a place you can go to. For me it will be an every few months experience."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here in a Sunday while visiting Pittsburgh area. A small very busy diner that also has some outdoor seating. Good food and friendly service. Everyone in our party of four enjoyed the food they ordered which ranged from dinner plate sized blueberry pancakes, to Bobs grill which was a big breakfast. Bacon thick and done perfectly. I would definitely return. Bobs has free parking in its own lot."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and decor unpleasant. Prices too high. I would be unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Typical diner food, only had breakfast & a few sandwiches but all were good, as far as service, ask for Marlene, GREAT server, makes sure your drinks are filled, & makes you feel welcome"}
{"text":"The tuna sandwich was good and what you expect from a diner but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. The diner was in need of cleaning and repairs. The waitress was nice enough once someone waited on me but that took a bit as they were arguing about who was off and wasn't. You would have thought it was near closing time. Also the outside sign lured me in with pumpkin specials and there wasn't a pumpkin item to be had."}
{"text":"Best diner in the area. It's now called \"Our Diner\" located at 110 Allegheny not the posted address. Small little place with quality food."}
{"text":"My Fav place for a meal! Thinking of this place I'm drooling! I had Eggs Bendict! Oh man! Their eggs were huge like extra large! And their ham on it is theirs smoked! And the sauce was great it wasn't a cheese sauce but the sauce used I don't know name its French. Big English muffins toasted crispy& buttered! Come here w big appetites! I can say this and their corned beef has w poached eggs are off the wall delish. I'm in a wheelchair and they have a ramp to get in it!I can't wait to go again! we ate brunch last Friday and
Has Poached Eggs on Corned beef hash big platter w Italian Mancini toast! Their home fries taste buttery crispy brown! I ate every bite and it was a lot that My next meal was next day! I was that full! Sooo good W their pancakes! Forget IHops come here for fresh pancakes big as plates! Try it!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Bob's in Castle Shannon on Saturday and won't be back.  My very small BLT had only 2 pieces of bacon on only 1 half of the sandwich!  Cold side of frozen french fries for $2 extra?  My husband's breakfast came out with burnt black rye toast (he ordered white), over easy eggs that were runny and cold hash browns.  We waited almost 20 minutes for this mess too."}
{"text":"The food, service, everything is fantastic here. We love the warmth everytime we step in the door. As soon as you walk in you're  greeted with a warm hello and tonight was seat yourself please. 
We ordered everything from fried chicken to burgers and the best for me, tonight's special which was prime rib. Not a bad price of 16.99 which included a potato and a vegetable. I chose mashed which were nice and fluffy and I devoured them. 
We chose to pass on dessert tonight but we did start with a zucchini appetizer which was fresh and tasty. 
You will never go home hungry, this joint is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and my cousin took my boyfriend and I here for breakfast. The food was very good and the service was amazing. We sat at the counter and watched the cook make all the amazing food. We liked it so much we went back 2 days later and they remembered us. We will make a point of eating here every time we are in town."}
{"text":"Was super excited go try Bobs as I just moved to the area and was happy to have a cute diner! My fiance and I stopped in around 1230 for a late breakfast. It was not crowded at all with many empty tables, which typically means fast service! We were sat at our table and waited 10+ minutes and still no one came. There was a waitress cleaning tables in area and a hostess who sat more people behind us. Still no one came. So we left. We shouldn't have to call a waiter over or have to tell someone to service us. We won't be back. Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Solid Breakfast! 

I had an egg white omelette with mushrooms, ham and Swiss: the eggs were fluffy, and the cheese melted perfectly into the juicy ham and mushrooms. 

My Husband enjoyed the Dad's Double Breakfast, with scrambled eggs, bacon & sausage, wheat toast and two Banana Pecan pancakes. Again, the eggs were fluffy and the pancakes were cooked perfectly and loaded with bananas and pecans.

Both meals came with Homefries, which were just ok: some of the potatoes weren't cooked all the way through and some tasted of old \"grease.\"

The service was prompt and very friendly; and the coffee was hot and fresh. We will definitely go back with our children, who I'm sure will love it!"}
{"text":"I like Bob's.  I've only been once, but will be back.  Here's what I like:

- It's bigger inside than it appears from the outside.  Plenty of seating.

- Service is quick, like a good diner.

- Menu has lots of variety.  All the breakfast stuff, plus lots of sandwiches and traditional hot food.

- My burger was strong!  It's a standard cheeseburger, with a patty fried on a flat-top, then lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions.  But it just works.  The patty is quite juicy, the bun is fresh and warm, and it all comes together.

I need to go back for more."}
{"text":"Bob's Diner is everything you could hope for in a diner. Fast and courteous service, delicious and reasonably priced food.

Whenever I'm in the area, this is where I go, and I highly recommend it for anyone else as well!"}
{"text":"Several at our table loved their breakfast sandwiches. I had the corned beef hash (good) and blueberry pancakes (somewhat tasteless). The prices are about average for breakfast. Coffee is on the weak side. The parking is extremely limited so we had to park down the street and walk. The service was inadequate but they seemed to be short staffed on the day we visited."}
{"text":"One star only because you can't have zero. I asked my waitress what their quiche of the day was and she rattled off a few, I asked for the 4 cheese and she basically insisted I try the Philly cheese steak....I think they had to get rid of it or something. since she was so insistent, I ordered it and a side of bacon, Which I requested extra crispy. The quiche was dry, very chewy, had no seasoning and the crust was soggy...I think they left it in the microwave too long. The fruit that came with it had 4 tiny strawberry slices, 3 slices of banana a few small pieces of melon and 4 grapes...the potatoes were not worth eating and the bacon...well, I guess that they couldn't microwave long enough.  My waitress, after insisting I order garbage, was no where to be found...she never came back to the table until I asked another server to please get my check....then she finally came back and brought a box for my mostly uneaten breakfast. She never once asked if there was something wrong with the food. I gave her the money for the check and she disappeared again for almost 10 minutes..she came back and advised me she took so long because she was chatting with another table of people she knew....great. I boxed the food up, told her it was awful but she was welcome to take the leftovers since she suggested that it was so delicious. Again, no apology or anything. I like the Bobs in Carnegie and on Grove Road....but Painters Run....just BAD! This was my 2nd visit there and both were a waste of money. Too many other great breakfast places around to waste money on a location with bad food and horrible service."}
{"text":"Almost no parking available for how many tables they serve. My philly cheese steak sandwhich was fatty steak, and ended up having some ham inside it. The monte cristo was soggy and soaked in oil and made on French toast. The garden salad was old limp brown lettuce. The grilled cheese has fake Kraft cheese on it. The only good to our trip was our waitress was extremely nice. Very poor dining experience. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Had corned beef hash and stuffed strawberry french toast. So good! On top of that we loved our waitress. Highly recommend this diner. Would like to come back soon for daily lunch or dinner specials."}
{"text":"Went there the other Sunday it was about noon and it was a little busy, but the service was very good. I went to order breakfast... Then I seen the special menu. Bam there it was meat lovers omelet. Of course I had to try being my first time there.. Loved it.. 
The wife had been there before and she had took me this time.. She had told me how good it was and I wasn't believing her.. Now I'm telling you it's worth it.. Keep a good thing going. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Bob's. It is a place we miss since moving to TX. I made a point to stop here for dinner when I was home for the holidays. I had the patty melt and onion rings. It was wonderful! This was my 1st experience with the dinner hour when we lived in Carnegie we had breakfast every Sat & Sun. The safe is always nice, fast, and the restaurant is always clean. I will make a point to stop in when I am home again in April."}
{"text":"Returned for the second time today to Bob's Diner for lunch and was more than satisfied! My boyfriend ordered the double cheeseburger and it was THE BIGGEST burger I have ever seen! I had the grilled chicken salad again because I am obsessed with their homemade Italian dressing."}
{"text":"Holy Cow was I stuffed after a recent breakfast at Bob's Diner at the McKees Rock location.  I had the Dad's double that was more then this dad could handle.  Wife had the Burrito, and consumed half of it before faltering.  The granddaughters French Toast was twice what she was able to put down, and my daughters Dad's single was to much for her.  And, all four meals were terrific!  I'd like to have the pancake recipe, they were very fluffy and tasteful. The food was worth going back for.

The waitress, Dawn, and all others that assisted were fantastic.  Very friendly and extremely hard workers.

Value?  Four (4) full breakfast's for about $35.00.  You can't beat that price. 

The restaurant is small, and hidden in a strip mall with a sign that read's DINNER.  Kind of quaint but very clean.  Plenty of parking.

Will we go back?  Darn tootin we will."}
{"text":"We've tried Bobs a few times, wanting so much to like it. It's just not good. Greasy, undercooked food. And it's dirty. Dirty tables, dirty chairs, dirty menus. Yuck."}
{"text":"Great diner atmosphere, friendly staff and really good food too. We got breakfast and both enjoyed it a lot. The eggs, bacon and sausage were all very good. I was impressed that they used red potatoes and prepared them a little different that I am used to getting at other breakfast places. We also got a pancake to share and it was delicious. One of the best pancakes I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"After having our memorial day plans deterred due to a car sick child, we were looking for a nearby restaurant to grab brunch. After calling 5 local brunch spots, I was highly disappointed that they were all closed or closing within the hour. Luckily, I remembered that a new diner had opened on Grove road. When I called Bob's, I was thrilled to find out that they were open until 2. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly. The hostess, noticing that I was preggo (what she didn't know was that I was actually OVERDUE) sat us in the cooler part of the restaurant. Apparently the other side was rather warm. She then proceeded to bring crayons and paper for our 2 year old. Off to a great start!

The menu is quite extensive. Everything you could want for brunch or lunch was represented on the menu, including several options for the sweet tooth. Our server arrived promptly and we were able to quickly place our order. She brought our drinks and we then waited for 20 minutes (for brunch food?). It was a bit excessive but, the restaurant was full. (Probably because it was the only place open!) When my fancy, fruity waffle arrived, I was very impressed. The waffle was the perfect combo of sweet and crispy. Topped with cut strawberries and a mound of whipped cream, it was a feast for the eyes. The kids pancake meal was also very impressive. A huge, full size pancake with mickey mouse ears, a strawberry/banana face and a slice of bacon. The overall experience was better than expected. The only downfall for me was that the inside looks like it is in need of some remodeling/updates."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since i had bobs but i always thought their food was delicious and service was good..had to give them 3 stars today tho. Our waitress all about forgot about us after we got our food. If she would have we could have told her that our potatoes were cold.. and we didnt order them Alaskan style."}
{"text":"I was told this was the place to go. I am rather disappointed. The word burrito infers refried beans. Which there's has none. So call it a wrap then. Browned eggs equal burnt eggs. Wife had fancy waffles with strawberries. I believe they use a high end brought waffle mix. Which is acceptable. Coffee was rather bitter"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.  Loved the atmosphere.  Would recommend.  Steak salad was real steak and a lot of it, breakfast was plenty and cooked perfect.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm in here all the time for lunch as it's convenient to my office.  The food is reliably good, soups are excellent and the service never lets me down.  Cup of soup and a half grilled cheese is my go-to, but the patty melt is also great.  It's clear from watching the waitstaff all like each other and work together as a team.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! They have a wide variety to choose from and the prices are reasonable.
I had the basic breakfast, \"dippy\" eggs with fresh hot sausage links and mancinis toast!
The waitstaff is so nice and friendly and they will not let you go without coffee!!
The only downer i had and I imagine it was a one time thing, was the internet was down and they couldn't take credit cards, which is a pain for me because I never carry cash anymore. But I'm sure that was just that day of the visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with my bride. I had the Greek quiche \" quiche of the day\"
She had the pancakes
The quiche was fresh and huge, served with fresh fruit and home fries
The pancakes were as big as the plate and fluffy and delicious
They also cater!"}
{"text":"Stopped @ Bobs Diner for breakfast. The food wasn't bad but really wasn't that good either. Pretty basic diner food, nothing special. The eggs Benedict didn't have a lot of flavor, the pancake was chewy & the egg sandwich was kind of greasy. Wasn't the worst diner food I've had however isn't worth going back. There are much better diners around the city. 
Service was ok, waitress was friendly & prices are decent. The diner wasn't dirty but yet didn't feel really clean either."}
{"text":"We came, we saw, we ate...

I decided to check this place out after the great reviews.    This is a diner that is busy.   We went on a Sunday.   We had  a short wait and took a seat at the counter.    We were quickly served coffee and given our menus.

I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich - Pittsburgh Style (when in Rome)...     It was huge and it was very good.

The place looks to serve quality food.   My meal was great.

Service - Great - these guys were busy.  Coffee refills came when I needed them, the food was served hot.   What more can one ask?

Food - Very good -Thick toasted bread, bacon, potatoes, egg, cheese - served with a side of mayo.   Cost - Reasonable - 2 breakfasts for $17 ($8.50) per...   Not bad considering you will not need to eat for the next 3 days.

Atmosphere - Very good - we talked to all the folks around us - it was a fun place.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Next time I eat here - I will wear sweat pants...

This will be a breakfast destination when I want to over indulge (or I went out the night before).

I like breakfast and they serve a good one :-).   I chose to sit at the counter (due to there were no open tables) and felt sorry for the waitress.    The diner was so crowded (due to the good service / food) that the servers had to orchestrate Cirque du Soliel movements behind the counter with large platters of food.

The food was very good and as Leah mentioned earlier (at a reasonable price).

I will be back!

Food - $8 
Service - Great - The waitress was friendly even though she was busy.
Atmosphere - Very busy - but still pretty clean considering the foot traffic.

Please note the parking lot was full when I arrived.   This will be your biggest obstacle to a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! I had the banana stuffed french toast with a side of eggs over medium and corned beef hash. 

The banana stuffed french toast was absolutely out of this world!  Made with Mancinis bread, it was buttery and delicious ... Not soggy, cooked perfectly. The corned beef hash has green peppers and onions and it adds an incredible flavor! 

The coffee was smooth and delicious ground in house and the Orange juice is fresh... What more could you ask for?! 

The staff was very friendly too! This experience was the first on many more to come!"}
{"text":"Always good diner food for a great price with decent service. If you like breakfast on a budget, it's hard to beat - especially in the area."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars, but Bob's deserves it for serving such a fantastic breakfast.  I haven't had a breakfast this good since California.  California diners are great with the little things, and so is Bob's.  As an example, the slice of orange served with my egg breakfast.

My scrambled eggs were actually scrambled and fluffy.  So good!

The pancake was also the best I have had in years.  

I just saw on the news that they will soon be making their own donuts.  Can't wait to try those!"}
{"text":"I finally got to eat here and it was absolutely delicious!  My husband and I joined friends for dinner Monday night. Our waitress was friendly and not over bearing. Our dinners were all delicious!  (Between all of us, we ordered a Reuben with onion rings, a chop steak dinner with mashed potatoes & veggies,  and 2 pot roast specials.)

The only reason for 4 stars is that for 4 of us it was really pricey for a diner. With tip, we spent just over $100. 

I will definitely return though and try something else on their extensive menu. Hopefully next time everything will be just as tasty before!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. My server, Debbie, was just the sweetest lady ever. I got biscuits and gravy. Came with fries, she said I can also get hash browns so I did that. Asked for a side of eggs and toast, and she recommended a style of toast (can't remember what it's called) that's really popular in Pittsburgh, so I went with that, and wow it was great! I can't say enough about her. The food was so good, service was outstanding. Definitely a place I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice little find on a Sunday after church. There was a long wait, but we were quite happy with the meal. Not high end brunch but your typical pittsburgh kind of dive breakfast spot. Cheap price. Big portions. Pretty solid breakfast foods."}
{"text":"I was apartment searching in Carnegie on Good Friday since I had off work. I've been searching Craiglist but sometimes you're lucky enough to find a \"for rent\" sign on a great apt that isn't listed on craigslist. I didnt really have luck, but i worked up an appetite. 

I had passed a few places in Carnegie to eat, but the words 'diner' really stuck out to me. Also, I noticed from the decal on the door that they took cards which was a plus. They had specials for Lent and the crab cake sandwich stuck out to me. I also took a look at their menu which wasnt bad at all.. usual diner fare.

The crabcake sandwich was satisfying and it came with a side of fries and cole slaw. The cole slaw was actually good. My mom is one of those people who wants hers to bathe in dressing. She wouldn't have liked Bob's but it had just the right amount in my opinion.

Service was okay. They were busy and you felt as if the server was rushed but that was fine.

I could agree with the other reviewers who mentioned the upholstered chairs that could use a good scrubbin (or just new ones) & that the food takes foreverrrrrr- hence the only 3 star review. However, an older gentleman stopped to ask how my meal was (the owner im assuming?) Afterwards he went back into the kitchen and i couldn't see/hear any other cooks, so im thinking he does it all on his own.. which would explain the wait times. I'll wait for an old sweetie to cook for food! 

If i become lucky and find an apartment in downtown Carnegie, then I'll be back for some dinre fare."}
{"text":"Sorry to say but this location is going down the tubes. We are regulars--very regular--and there's been a decline in the quality of certain foods. Had hamburgers--which are delicious here, but--getting tired of wilted, soggy old  lettuce thrown on a bun...produce seems sub-par. Fries that are barely warm are worthless. Food should be served HOT for the price we pay--$8 for a burger, $9 with fries. Had mashed potatoes that were barely warm. I don't like to send back food--but I make mental notes and it's happening too frequently these days. The waitresses and hostesses are very friendly and most times, very efficient. They need to help each other out though, by grabbing and delivering hot food--even if it's not their table. A few waitresses do work very well together as a \"team\" but this needs to be addressed to all of them--teamwork makes success. I'm disappointed--I love Bob's...the way it was in the beginning--clean, fresh produce, nice quantity and quality. If you're going to raise prices, you gotta keep up the consistency or you're losing customers fast. Good luck...I sincerely hope things improve."}
{"text":"Tried Bob's for the first time today. The food was good-- we got eggs and pancakes- and our service was friendly. However, I was very put-off by the lack of cleanliness. I eat out a lot, and I think the floor in this place was the dirtiest I have ever seen. Also, the upholstered chairs looked downright grimy. Sorry to say that I won't be back and can't recommend it. When the basics aren't taken care of out front, I can only imagine what is happening back in the kitchen..."}
{"text":"Very large menu with all your breakfast needs. We went with a large group and they were able to accommodate us. My husband's French toast was made exactly how he likes it. The cookies and cream pancakes were a unique choice and a little too large to finish in one sitting (no dollar from bob for us). As far as diners go, this was a great find and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed:( the home fries tasted old and and my egg benedict the English muffin was drenched in butter:(

I hate that this place was gross:( the service was wonderful. I would give them One more star, but I can't! Three stars means I will be back...and I won't. However the service was great and fast. Perhaps we got them on an off day. I am not sure. However it was just not good, at all.

I hate that my food wasn't good, because I love little diners like this."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often but left without eating  breakfast on Sunday, January 25. 
We stood at the door while servers walked around us. Tables were not cleaned off so we couldn't just sit down. The usual workers weren't there so maybe there was a new crew."}
{"text":"Service was good, lovely lady waited on us and was very pleasant. 


The food on the other hand, was garbage. The chicken was so gross I didn't eat it. I just ate the average french fries.

It's a little run down on the inside."}
{"text":"I had a chance to stop here last night after work, ( It's right down the street from me )
I thought this place was very good. I ordered the \"Special\" and was very impressed.
Pot Roast was very good and fresh. lotsa potatoes and carrots. Prices were what I expected to pay. The staff was extreeeeemly friendly & fast. I give Bob's 5 stars.

You people are way too tough on many of these small places. Seriously , if the parking lot is a big issue with you , your not focused on the big picture !
Park down the street and walk your lazy ass to the front door !
 We NEED to keep places like this going , or we will be stuck with Denny's on every street corner. Bob's is going to be one of my new places to eat."}
{"text":"Typical diner, which is always a compliment. Good coffee, friendly service, and you watch them make your food right in front of you. Had eggs, Italian toast, sausage and biscuits, and potatoes--all were very good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile now.  Always good food, friendly  service, and reasonable prices.  Good old-fashioned diner fare . . . not frozen, trucked-in, national chain food."}
{"text":"This is my 4th trip to this diner.  Food has always been good but the service isn't worth it! My husband and I went on a Saturday a little after lunch. There were probably 10 other people in the place and quite a few employees. With the amount of employees at the time there is no reason we shouldn't have had refills or things done in a timely manner! No one seemed to want to be there and it showed. We won't be going back! Gab and eat is right around the corner with great food and service!"}
{"text":"Hi we came to your location this am after my sons hockey game. We ordered our expensive breakfast since nothing came with sides and you do not have waffles on the kids menu only pancakes as an option. So for my 8 year old and I our total was 28.00, which is crazy! I ordered bacon but it was cooked too long that it was hard and crumbled when I bit it. I returned that. But our food was cold it was so cold inside the diner like cold enough most of the guest and us had kept their coats on. So my son refused to eat the cold waffle and was starving by the time I got home. I told the cashier when she asked how our breakfast was I said not so good. It was cold and not worth the price in my opinion. My son said the waffle tasted funny and was cold when it arrived. She said nothing in response to that. So I paid my bill and the table kept our not so great breakfast plates, went home and had to make another meal because he was still hungry. I am extremely disappointed. On a side note although our waitress was ok to us she was very unpleasant and complained openly in front of our table and the table behind us that was just seated in her area because they requested a booth the hostess replied I'm sorry they wanted to sit here. She said nasty whatever just get them drinks....."}
{"text":"I didn't have great expectations for Bob's, given that Pamela's is nearby and we've had good experiences at CC's and the Dor-Stop.  How could this new offering really compete?  In short, I was pleasantly surprised and Bob's is now my go-to diner!

The food is delicious and servings usually more than I expected.  I always get breakfast, and was happy with the amount of potatoes, the way my eggs are cooked (over medium - not everyone gets it right!), and the 4, count 'em, 4 pieces of bacon.  

What really sets Bob's apart is that the coffee tastes great!  IMHO, they have the best diner coffee around.

Also nice - they accept all major credit cards - much more convenient than a few other local diners that are cash only.

One caution though - the parking at the Grove Road location is scarce - the parking lot gets 100% full even when the diner itself is less than half full."}
{"text":"This place is a real sleeper. It doesn't look like much when you're driving by, but the food is surprisingly good. 

I had the crispy chicken salad. It consisted of lots of greens (mostly iceberg lettuce) + onions + cherry tomatoes + cucumber slices + banana peppers + cheddar cheese + a large chicken breast that was beautifully fried. There were also French fries on the top--a P'burgh tradition!

My husband had a BLT.

We were both very pleased.

Our waitress also was very attentive & efficient."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is a New York City or New Jersey diner near Pittsburgh!

The service is a little quirky, but the food more than makes up for it. Huge pancakes, dinner plate size, thick bacon, great breakfast potatoes and eggs that were cooked perfectly.

My wife had fried chicken that would put the Colonel out of business with real mashed potatoes. For her salad, the waitress suggested mixing sweet & sour with ranch and it was spectacular.

Huge menu selections, typical back east diner fare done with perfection."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here just good Pittsburgh diner breakfast! I love diners and Bob's is a decent one. This trip I got the Bob's Bountiful Breakfast which includes 2 eggs, turkey sausage or what ever breakfast meat you want, home fries and toast. They have Mancini toast! My husband got the Double Dads which just adds on extra meat and 2 pancakes. We always share and it's always too much for 2 people to eat. Their pancakes are huge! Service is good and the staff is usually friendly."}
{"text":"Good diner atmosphere. I have only been to the one in carnegie for breakfast. They serve Mancini's bread! Cost is reasonable and you get a lot of food-I can never eat everything on my plate. Bob's original breakfast sandwich is good and their homefries are excellent. Service has been good and not-so-good. All depends on the waitress."}
{"text":"Above average diner. Huge pancakes
And while more expensive than a Denny's, it is local and not depressing like a Denny's. Will go back."}
{"text":"This was a favorite for me until they had a price increase!! To much for what you get! It now cost us $26.80 for 2 bobs bountiful breakfast wit 2 cups of coffee!!!! This is crazy.  Go right over to eggs r us get the same thing for $16.00"}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast spot! Always the friendliest staff. The food has always been spectacular and good sized portions. No complaints whatsoever. I highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Another perk, even though it's a smaller diner, you don't leave smelling like fried foods. Their home fries are mouth-watering!"}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall with good home cooked meals & small town folk to warm your heart."}
{"text":"Typical diner setting, but the food is unexpectedly good. I've ordered the quiche of the day several times and it's always exceptionally good, like something you'd pay $15+ for at a fancy cafe. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I like this place. 
every other day has breakfast 
nice big portion 
cool country style.
food is good .

but need little bit repairs job."}
{"text":"Not crazy about this diner. I have to remind myself to ask everywhere I go if the French toast is made with cinnamon, apparently its not a standard ingredient. I forgot to ask this time and whataya know, NO CINNAMON! It had a pretty bland taste. The pancakes are huge, definitely shareable and the turkey sausage was pretty good. I probably won't be returning...just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"If you're in the neighborhood, an OK place to grab a bite. However, I wouldn't make a special trip. Friendly (but not particularly fast or attentive) staff, and a teeny-tiny parking lot. If you make the trip, I wouldn't order the home fries. Saying that they are under whelming is the nicest way to put it. The prices are comparable to better diners. It's great to have a neighborhood spot, but I just wish when we return it was because it was awesome and not just because it's close."}
{"text":"Home for the holidays good tour at bobs diner. My grandpa wanted to take me to breakfast and he says is is his favorite restaurant to come to. We were immediately seated with menus and asked for drinks. The server was very attentive. I ordered the Mancini raisin French toast and eggs. They were two thick slices with their secret batter. They tasted great and fluffy. Anything with Mancini bread is going to be good. They had a nice breakfast menu and the prices are great. I can see why my grandfather loves this place. If you think parking is minimal you can always park around the back. They did mess up my moms omelette but they fixed it immediately and made a new one in a timely manner. Since they fixed it so quickly and apologized my mom didn't think twice about it. The one thing I miss about Pittsburgh is the great service and family restaurants."}
{"text":"My friends were getting together for breakfast to celebrate school being out. (They are teachers.) The friend who was putting the gathering together chose this restaurant.  I had been to another Bob's location when it first opened and it was horrible.  It's been awhile so I thought I would give this location a shot.  I was rather shocked when I got there because the parking lot was full.  That's a good thing and a bad thing.  It's a good thing because it means people like it there.  It's a bad thing because I ended up parking on the road.  Two others in our group parked at a business close by that was closed but then got yelled at by a customer of that business.  It would benefit the restaurant greatly if they could find a way to expand parking.  Thankfully though I was parked on the road my car didn't get hit.  We went in and seated ourselves as per the sign.  It took a long time before our server came to our table.  In fact we rarely saw our server.  It was busy when we first went in but cleared out soon after so I'm not sure where the server was.  When she was waiting on us she was very nice.  
I ordered the breakfast that had eggs (I chose scrambled), breakfast meat (I chose bacon), home fries, and toast (I chose Italian).  It took quite awhile for our food to come.  I'm not sure why it took so long and we weren't given an excuse or an apology.  My eggs were soft scrambled.  I would have sent them back but had no idea how long it would be before I got food back.  The bacon was thick and cooked nicely-a little crispy and a little chewy.  The home fries were a bit overdone.  You received a big portion that covered half your plate.  They were ok but nothing to write home about.  The toast was toasted nicely but had a ton of butter on it.  I wiped about half of it off.  I ate about 1/3 of my meal and got a box for the rest.  I was still a little hungry (just turned off by the eggs) so I ate part of a fruit plate that my friend had ordered.  It was the biggest fruit plate I had seen and four of us ate from it.  The fruit was fresh which was nice.  So my experience had it's ups and downs.  I hope you get a good experience if you check this place out."}
{"text":"Two words-Never Again. We'll start at the beginning. When we walked in it seemed a little warm. In fact it seemed warmer inside the building than it did outside and outside it was 85degrees. As we sat down we saw different types of fans were set up trying to cool the restaurant down. The air conditioner was broken. *sigh*. And we couldn't feel the air from the fans because two young boys were standing in front of them being incredibly loud and obnoxious. 
We placed our order-Biscuits and Gravy for me and a Meatloaf sandwich for my hubby. 
It seemed the longer we sat there the hotter it got. I used the Daily Special placard to fan myself. It was so hot that my ice in my glass melted within 5 minutes. It took FORTY MINUTES to get our meal. 
My husband's meal was two pieces of thin white sandwich bread with two thin slices of meatloaf between them. It was 90% filler and 10% meat. There was a small scoop of mashed potatoes next to it and a dark brown sauce poured all over it. I tried a bite and could barely swallow it.  YUCK!!
I are a couple of bites of potatoes that were on my plate. They weren't the home fries I was expecting. I then took a bite of the biscuits and gravy. It was beyond disgusting. The \"sausage\" tasted like Spam and it was pink. I wouldn't eat another bite because I didn't want to get sick from undercooked \"sausage. I was so sickened that I didn't eat another bite and left a plate full of food untouched. My husband choked his meatloaf down. He has a stronger stomach than I do.  
If you see a Bib's diner just keep driving. There are better places to eat. Instead of having a vast menu of nasty food they should taper down the number of dishes offered and try to work on making the food taste edible."}
{"text":"It's opening day at Bob's in Castle Shannon and everything was great as expected for this local chain. They had been teasing the area with a huge sign by route 88, but it's finally ready! I suppose this is a four star diner, if that's a thing. The N family are strong patrons.

This Bob's is most similar to the location in Carnegie as far as the service and food, but with brand new decor and a few extra parking spaces. The only tiff I had was with the bathroom which was not touched from the take over of the failed Greek joint, but who says you can have it all. The place is actually set up a little odd with scattered booths and the full counter in the back corner. It took a few tries to find the correct entrance as well.

Even though Bob's is for breakfast, we came for early dinner, which means soup and sandwiches in my book. Luckily, one if the soups today was chicken rice which was more of a paste (in a good way?) and crazy filling. The turkey is thick, bread still from Mancini's. Add the house made Italian dressing on fresh greens and I am set. I don't want to act like this is the best food I've ever had, but I was definitely satisfied. I do wish they made their own chips, especially considering they're the standard side.

It's a great diner. Easy, not greasy, clean, friendly. And of course Bob himself was in for opening day! It's hard to not want to support him. Especially when you can end your meal with coconut cloud cake from neighbor Signature Desserts. Overall classic and simple, exactly the way it should be."}
{"text":"It being Memorial Day most of the restaurant options that we wanted to go to wear clothes unless we arrived at Bob's Diner. I ordered a turkey sandwich with cheddar my wife ordered the eggs benedict and our daughter ordered the chicken tenders with fries. The sandwich itself was good however the fries were mediocre-at-best I tasted some of my wife's food and the potatoes were not good nor was the eggs benedict my daughter's chicken tenders were okay but then again they are chicken tenders. Service was pretty good prices were good as well however I 3 star rating means I'll be back and I would not go back to this particular location thus it gets two stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been by for dinner twice. The food is delicious. The service was a tad slow, but that's what you get for meals being cooked to order. The prices are midrange for dinner, and the servings are huge, all except for the Wednesday night lasagna, which was oddly lonely on the plate.

Parking is a bit of a pain. They have more tables than parking spots, so you're pretty much guaranteed to be out of luck if there's any wait time."}
{"text":"First time at this location, often go to the Bob's in Castle Shannon. Long wait for service. Food consistent to other Bob's."}
{"text":"I was in McKeesport Rocks and saw a sign for Bob's Diner.  I am always looking for a good diner and I picked the right one.  Nice atmosphere and not too busy for the early lunch hour.  The menu was extensive but I always love a good omelet.  I got the bacon and provolone omelet with fried potatoes and mancini's toast.  The omelette was fluffy and stuffed full.  I ended up taking some home with me.  I was told to come back and I assured them I will.  Will bring back friends the next time."}
{"text":"I'm kind of struggling whether to give 3 or 4 stars.  I ate here with my son while my car was being repaired around the corner.  We like going to diners for breakfast, and we've been to another Bob's Diner location in the past so I knew what to expect food-wise.

I really wanted oatmeal and I really did not want home fries. So I got my order a la carte and the cost came to be about the same as if I had ordered one of the predefined menu items.  I was glad about that.

I got two eggs and toast.  I chose over easy and wheat.  The eggs were great but the toast was over-toasted.  Not quite burnt but too toasted to actually soak up the egg yolk.  I also got bacon.  The bacon tasted fine but I'm finding that I don't care for the thick sliced variety.  I prefer thin and crispy, so next time I'll probably omit the side of bacon.  The oatmeal was very good.  I really enjoy a good bowl of oatmeal.  It came with raisins, brown sugar, and milk (couple ounces.)

Of course I got coffee, and this is why I'm leaning toward three stars.  It just wasn't hot.  And the waitress did not come around nearly enough to refill the cup."}
{"text":"Took a weekend trip to Pittsburgh and this place was close to where we stayed so it was a easy stop. 

The food and portions are great and I love the feel of the place. It was pretty busy but the food didn't take too long to arrive. I would definitely stop here again if I came back to visit."}
{"text":"We went here three times.  Parking is very difficult.  The first trip there was shortly after they opened. Everything seemed wonderful on our first trip, than it became progressively worse.  It almost seemed they where trying very hard, than gave up.  Service had always been great but lacks good food."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about Bob's Diner, my wife and I decided to visit for an early dinner after attending the Pittsburgh Pirates game of Wednesday, 7 May 2014.  

We were immediately greeted by two delightful and friendly people, including the lady who would be our server and a gentleman who apparently works in the kitchen.  They engaged us in pleasant conversation about the game and immediately established rapport, making us feel welcome.

My wife ordered liver and onions, which came with homemade mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.  I had a reuben sandwich, which came with bagged chips. We were brought two large slices of fresh Italian bread and soft butter. We shared an order of onion rings for an appetizer. The portion sizes were standard.  All of our food was delicious.  My sandwich was served on a nice marble rye bread.  The bagged chips meant nothing to me as this is something that I can have at home.   Eat 'n Park serves excellent homemade chips with its sandwiches and entrees. Although we did not have dessert, they looked good and I was impressed to see an old-fashioned milkshake machine.

Throughout the meal, our server was efficient and gracious, performing a quality check.

With early bird $1.00 discounts and a $1.00 coupon, our total tariff came to just over $20, a bargain for all of the good food that we enjoyed.

The downside of the restaurant is that it is old, old, old: badly in need of renovation and style. Unlike Bob's Diner in Carnegie, Eat 'n Park offers modern, bright, cheerful, attractive restaurants.  If Bob's would adopt a similar strategy, it would be a place that I would be anxious to visit again.  As it stands, I would not go out of the way to dine there again.

The restaurant is to open a new location in my community of Upper Saint Clair soon in an area in which a number of restaurants have failed.  I hope that this new location will be a modern, bright, uplifting facility, and that it will succeed."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, you might have a long wait, but totally worth it!  Food is really good!  Ordered the kids breakfast and they ate it for 4 days there was so much!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat here twice during an extended business trip to the area.  I was able to be here for dinner only and had the country fried steak and mashed potatoes with a side of vegetables - broccoli the first time and carrots the second time.  I had a choice of white or brown gravy and took the brown gravy both times.

The steak was tender with a nice crunchy coating, and the potatoes were decent. The carrots were really good and went well with the potatoes and gravy, like a version of a pot roast dinner (which they also offer).

The service was friendly, and the food came out of the kitchen pretty quickly.  My only is not getting here on a Tuesday night to try the turkey dinner special.  Otherwise, I would eat here again"}
{"text":"I'm a regular, so this may not apply to newbies.  Treated well.  Take good care of me.  Food is always well-prepared and fresh.  Jodi is a good server!"}
{"text":"Bob's Diner continues to serve an excellent breakfast. This has become our new \"go to\" place for that first meal of the day.

They don't do anything fancy at Bob's Diner; they just consistently serve excellence on a plate. Their French Toast (made with Mancini's Bread) is probably the best I have ever had. 

Keep up the good work, Bob's!"}
{"text":"I visited Bob's on a recommendation from PA Beauty Supply where I was way too early for my class I was attending. It was Sunday at noontime and the place was hopping. The service was quick and friendly. The coffee was hot but nothing fantastic. I had the banana pecan pancakes which I warn you are massive and delicious. Very fresh. The prices are reasonable. It's worth checking out. The tables are a little close together for my liking, but I managed ok. All in all a nice experience."}
{"text":"Yikes, Bob's is getting a really bum rap, his small circle of neo-canteens finally expanding into the South Hills. We'd been to the his outpost in Kennedy Township some time ago, and when we found out that one recently sprouted in Upper Saint Clair, well, we knew had a trip ahead of us. 

For breakfast that chilly Saturday morning, I honestly enjoyed the Big Burrito, finding it generously appointed, the grilled flour tortilla bulging radiantly with eggs, homefries, onions, green peppers, and my choice of bacon, warm salsa, cheddar, and sour cream coming close to turning it into an enchilada, and damn  was this knife-and-fork material. The scrambled eggs were velvety, the homefries deftly seasoned and al dente, the vegetables lovingly caramelized, adding sweetness to contrast the tang of the sour cream and salsa and sharpness of the cheddar. Hearty as a 3 course meal, I barely had enough room left for the Oreo Pancakes. 

And yes, I will continue to trumpet the cause: Breakfast pancakes are dessert. Lunches and dinners have sweet endings. Why not breakfast? 

These were fairly standard griddlecakes with some Oreo crumbles on them, the commercially made cookies being but an afterthought, and that would be my only complaint.  I would have thought that the batter would have been infused with Oreo crumbs, but that was not the case here. Despite my mild disappointment, the flapjacks were properly fluffy and were topped with powdered sugar. Of course, warm maple syrup and butter were served alongside the golden stack. 

We had no issues with the service or the seating. Even \"Bob\" himself was on hand to greet us and seat us, his personality proving to be as sunny as the decor. 

From what I was tastin', Bob's fledgling empire of checkerboard-tiled luncheonettes is well on its way to competing with Pamela's and DeLuca's for diner supremacy.  Dismiss the savaging. Give Bob a chance. 

P.S. The parking lot is a bit small, so be mindful of that. 

P.P.S. We were told that the cakes and pies come from Castle Shannon's Signature Desserts."}
{"text":"Note #1: Breakfast is served all day.

Note #2: Bob's is located in a strip mall in an area that is also referred to as McKees Rocks with a different zip code of 15136 according to my receipt and the takeaway menu I pocketed. As you drive by the strip mall, look for the words \"DINER\" to jump out at you. 

Note #3: Aside from Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, they are open every single day for breakfast and lunch.

Note #4: A chain is obviously in the works as Bob's boasts diners in Imperial, Carnegie (coming soon!), and according to the fine print at the bottom of the menu, Bob is looking for licensees for more locations. Start up your own! You could operate your own Bob's!

Owner Bob Marshall, the friendly middle-aged, Alan Kalter-lookalike who will greet you as you enter his establishment, is apparently looking to challenge Pamela's and The Dor-Stop if his menu is evidential of anything. Sandwiches, salads, burgers, and breakfast are what's on deck for those who come here, but if Bob's wants to be a contender, he's gonna need to work on some things.

Take for example his Eggs Benedict, called \"Bob's Eggs Benny\" on the menu. The ham was fine, the eggs were poached superbly as Jacques Pepin would, the English Muffin was light, fluffy, fresh and was probably the best I've had in some time, but hollandaise sauce is what draws patrons to Eggs Benedict, and here lies my only gripe. 

I rarely ever order Eggs Benedict at restaurants, my mother having spoiled me with her transcendent hollandaise sauce, which according to her is a cinch to make; butter, prepared mayonnaise, a splash of lemon juice, egg yolks, salt, pepper, and half-and-half, being the ingredients (you figure out the proportions and technique, detectives). Well, upon tasting Bob's hollandaise, I got that \"pre-fab\" feeling, the Post-Gazette's Munch confirming my suspicions by saying in his own review from late November of 2009 that \"It's a great menu if only because one can order the Eggs Benedict. Yes, you read that correctly, Eggs Benedict in a diner at a strip mall. Bob admitted to have not made the Hollandaise sauce from scratch, but still, how cool?\" 

http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09330/1016343-440.stm

Hurm. 

Either paprika or cheyenne topped it off, just like Mom does, depending on which she has or what mood she's in. 

Not that it wasn't a pretty good Eggs Benedict. I liked everything about it but the sauce, which really just needed more flavor. 

The home fries that came with the Eggs Benedict were flying aces. The potatoes were generously cut, cooked ideally, and were not overly greasy.

Kay and I each ordered a side of corned beef since I wanted to try Bob's. Kay thinks it came from a can and just had onions and peppers added to it. I'm not exactly sure myself and never got around to asking, but I can't say that it was terrible. 

Bob's has an array of specialty pancakes and French Toasts. I almost ordered one Cookies 'N Cream pancake, but second-guessed myself and went with the Crispy Stuffed Strawberry French Toast. Was it bad? Not really, but I was left wishing I went with my original choice. The bread was tough, the secret strawberry cream-cheese (?) filling was a little too tart and the Rice Krispy-laced batter seemed scant. Adding syrup helped, but in the case of specialty French Toasts and pancakes, I don't feel I should need to drizzle syrup on them. Do you put syrup on a piece of pie or cake? 

Kay appeared to have ordered better than me. Her pancake was a heavy, doughy, obscenely flavorful, plate-blanketing medallion that was vastly different but just as choice as any of Pamela's or Dor-Stop's flapjacks. She let me try one of her sausage links, and I found that Bob's serves the best breakfast sausage as well as the best English Muffins that I've ever eaten. Each link looked as appetizing as a $3 stogie, that rough, burnt skin almost putting me off, but the hide turned out to be nicely flaky, concealing meat that was too gloriously fatty, moist, and succulent to comprehend. 

Kay's slab bacon was weighty, lean, and a bit chewy like beef jerky. The McKenzie Brothers might approve of it even if it isn't back bacon. 

Our breakfast at Bob's had some minor missteps, enough to keep it from being a full-on 5 stars but not enough to knock it down to 3, which is what I might have given it had I not helped Kay finish her meal. Hopefully Bob's Diner can correct these bugs.

Oh, Bob? My mom makes good French Toast too. She can help. Drop me a line. I'll put you in touch with her so you can get her recipes and work something out.

P.S. A band made up of retirees performed just outside the restaurant. Whether or not this happens regularly I couldn't tell you, but I got a kick out of it. They were swingin', daddy-o!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of Bob's establishments over the past few years, and this newest Castle Shannon location was where my soaraway brunch experience to date was had, this newest station in the ginger-haired man's mini-empire demonstrating not a single kink in terms of service or food. 

Formerly Hanni's and before that Opa, this Bob's features the requisite bright white decor punctuated by the franchise's soon-to-be-iconic \"solar\" logo, the interiors portending simple canteen fare that aims to make patrons smile and fuel them up for the day ahead. 

Quiche. Growing up, it always conjured visions of milquetoast men in tennis attire. \"Real men\" didn't eat it for breakfast as the maxim went, and so I didn't. That was until my sister made some for me once, and I came to the realization that I was essentially eating frittata or scrambled eggs re-imagined as a superior dish.  

For some reason, I eschewed ordering quiche at the other Bob's strongholds, but on this morning, when I heard our excellent server rattle off the varieties of it on the bill of fare (Bob's usually offers several different kinds daily), I stopped her when she uttered the words \"Bacon Cheddar Asparagus.\"

Bacon. Cheddar. Asparagus. 

And it was nothing short of...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ak6wR-PGmM 

The exteriors were browned like a quaint country omelet, but inside the wedge of egg, nothing but unadulterated, buttery yellow velvet could be found, aside from the luxurious Bacon, Cheddar, and Asparagus of course. The bacon naturally punctuated everything with its inherent saltiness, richness and crisp texture, but the green shoots were toothsome as well, and the cheese merely brought zing and amplified the creaminess. Dense yet flaky, the pie crust was a prime component also.\"Real men\" that still resemble a 70's Burt Reynolds may pass on it, but they're only missing out on some real good eatin' if ya ask me. I guess I should have started brunching with Alan Alda as an impressionable lad.

There was more to come. The opening sunrise salvo consisted of a briny and immensely flavorful and meaty corned beef hash that was riddled with a freshly chopped and vibrant tandem of caramelized onions and green bell peppers. 

Flanking the quiche was a refreshingly chilly fruit medley made up of sliced banana, strawberry, honeydew melon, and cantaloupe as well as a serving of home fried cubed redskin spuds so tender, oily, and cunningly seasoned, I had half a mind to take them home and turn them into some of the best potato salad ever crafted in my kitchen (I don't boil 'em well enough half the time). Not everyone does home fries well. Bob's does them exceedingly so. 

I get the feeling that this was one diner that Bob merely threw against a wall. I'm wagering that it'll stick. A ten-minute wait for a table and a line of hungry customers wrapped around the bend tells no lies."}
{"text":"Very average. I love diners and eat breakfast out everyday. I have been to Bobs about a dozen times or so. The food is ok, nothing stands out. I'm not sure what other reviewers were raving about the home fries .  I was not too impressed with them, big chunks of redskin potatoes, no garlic or onions ( none that I could find anyways).
   I tried the eggs Benedict on three different occasions and was disappointed in the hollandaise sauce. 
  Coffee was ok. The hash was also nothing special, I expected homemade cornbeef hash , but it was generic food service canned hash with a few peppers thrown in.
   I really want to like this place, but nothing stands out. $7.95 for a basic breakfast is not a deal in pittsburgh. Many places have the 2 egg, meat, potatoes and toast for $3.99 weekdays. 
  My overall opinion is that I will still come here, but will  not go out of my way."}
{"text":"Eat at Bob's.  A new diner from this small group of diners has opened in USC.  Nice and new and clean.  Our waitress was new and being trained or assisted by a veteran.  The service and food was good.   Tried the Dad's favorite.  Two eggs over easy cooked perfectly, bacon that was over cooked, sausage, a very large pancake that was good that had a sweet syrup, and some Mancini's raisin bread.  Did not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Bob's is a great little diner, with four locations in the Pittsburgh area. We ate at the McKee's Rocks location on our last visit to Pittsburgh. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by a view of all the breakfast goodies being cooked on the flat top. One thing to remember here: the portions are very big. My wife and I split a breakfast burrito made with fresh salsa, eggs, very spicy sausage, peppers, cheese etc. My only complaint would be the potatoes. They were definitely not needed. Our server was Dawn, who I also think was the manager. She was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Well we went to Bob's tonight it was like an ice block in there sat about 15 min the only two waitress there totally ignored us so we got up and left.  As we were in parking lot saw a girl with 2 kids told them we sat 15 min with no service she said screw that I meeting 3 other people meeting me we will go elsewhere.  Don't know what happened to my first review but place is going down hill fast.  More than likely not going back."}
{"text":"Went here ONE time and will never go back.  The service was the slowest I've ever seen anywhere.  The breakfast was Meh and very over priced.  Whatever floats your boat, but me and my money will never go there again."}
{"text":"First time at Bob's Diner and we really enjoyed it! The staff was friendly and the food was yummy. Parking is a nightmare but you'll get over it while you enjoy some great food. I had the pumpkin pancakes and coffee. I got an order to go for my husband and it didn't take very long even considering they were starting to get really busy. 
I'm happy to find a close by spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Oh, Bobs. You used to be one of my favorites. Today was the last straw. We got up and left after 10 minutes of being completely ignored. Sad- because the food is decent. But this has been a long time coming. Too many chances."}
{"text":"Sadly, this review is about the service not food. I love trying new diners and decided to give Bob's a try. I walked in here with my friend, both hungry and ready to try this place. We walked in and stood up at the front for a solid 10 minutes. A few dirty tables and no \"seat yourself\" sign. Waitresses passed us with eye contact and seemed focused on their tables, cooks saw us and kept cooking. I am not sure if their host was missing but the fact not one staff acknowledge us was surprising. A \"morning\" or \"be with you in a minute \" would of been nice. We came, wanted to eat yet had to go somewhere else. We chose DeLucas and I'm happy we did! Great food and fast service."}
{"text":"we finally made it, & sure glad we did! it's a diner; breakfast all day, plus reasonably priced meals. the service was efficient. the place is clean. the food pretty tasty.
we both had breakfast-me, 2 blueberry pancakes as big as the plate, & a side of ham that could have been a meal itself. tom got the 2 egg special with sausages, homefries & another massive pancake. 
we left stuffed!!! interested in coming back for the prime rib dinner for $16.95!  heck, we wanna go back to try all of it!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal: I like diners. I eat healthy the majority of the time (though this past month, not so much), and cook /bake from scratch. And I realuze diner food is more rib-sticking comfort food, and that you're going to loosen your belt another notch or two.

I was here with Daughter and a friend a year and a half ago. I vividly remember not being too tickled to pay $25+ for 2 pancake breakfasts and drinks. And it's ridiculous to pay $3 MORE to add meat to breakfasts that already average $9.

So, though really  hungry,  and not too happy that I took a T, and walked a quarter mile on the side of the busy road, just to find a sign on the door stating Trolley Barn closed for the weekend. I trudged along the busy road to Bob's, determined not to spend Daughter's inheritance on breakfast. 
I ordered the least expensive breakfast $2.95 for 2 eggs and toast. No Texas Toast. Italian? Fine.Then I found afterwards,  that they have seeded rye.

I ordered eggs over medium. Very runny. Server finally came back, and reordered them, after telling her I just wanted a little liquid yolk. Same. Third time wasn't a charm. Asked her again how to order them. She said over medium hard. No luck. Finally, I asked the REALLY nice cook herself how I should order them. She said \"over hard\". Fourth plate was perfect. Still, it shouldn't take 4 tries, especially when I kept asking server (never did get her name) \"How should I order these to get just a little liquid yolk?\" 

She wasn't particularly attentive,  as she was alone serving 5 booths, 1 table, and me (Counter Creature).  I said to the server they'll probably be slamned because Trolley Barn is closed, and she said they're always slammed. Okay...

I can't imagine returning.  I used the ladies room. Dirty, sticky floor, and smelled awful. The cakes, carrot included, were sitting in the sun, across from their front window. Not chilled. ALERT: The server said the cakes come from Signature Desserts! You know, the ones who sell stuff after flies were on it. The one server (not mine. Dark hair, glasses, black outfit, hair in bun), defended serving goidies previously enjoyed by flies. Eeewww! I couldn't pay and leave fast enough."}
{"text":"Walked in to the moderately busy diner around 10 am on Sunday morning. Looked like all the tables were taken, yet no one was waiting for a table either. No clear instruction was posted so I just stood at the entrance with my date. Over the next ten minutes, many members of the wait staff looked at us and said nothing. We were apparently in the way for one as well as they pushed through us to get to a table. 

After ten minutes of being completely ignored and not even greeted, we decided to dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Bob's diner is located here in Upper St Clair is the 4th location for this diner. I decided to stop over here en route home and try it out. Since it was a little after noon there was plenty of parking even though their lot is small. I entered and was told just to seat myself. They serve breakfast all day but I was in the mood for lunch but nothing overwhelming.

I noticed the menu has a special where you can order half a sandwich (limited choices on this sandwich) and pair it with either a cup of soup or small salad for $6.95. I decided to opt for that one and ordered roast turkey with lettuce and tomato. Got the food in a jiffy. I was amazed at the size of my order! The salad was more than enough for me and the half sandwich was big and came with chips. They were both very good. The turkey tasted fresh! 

I was looking in their dessert fridge and saw they had very little to offer. My waitress told me they don't get that much in at this time of year but they expect more tomorrow. All their desserts come from Signature desserts in Castle Shannon. I also learned that Jan-Mar is their slow season but they will pick up more business once winter is over.

They have daily specials on the chalkboard. I was pleased with my meal and definitely will return. She gave me a takeout menu. As I looked it over I can see why it gets so crowded in the morning. They offer M-F weekday breakfast special until 10 AM. This special consists of two eggs, choice of bacon, sausage or ham with toast for $5.95. Prices are very reasonable for breakfast regardless and I noticed the sell a lot of things made with Mancini's bread. They even have a kids menu which they encourage only for those 10 and younger.

They offer both hot and cold sandwiches, as well as burgers, and dinner entrees. I saw some people as I was leaving eating pancakes and other breakfast items so that's what I will try on my next visit. The menu is comprehensive so there is much to choose from. They do catering as well."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  The food is actually pretty good but we waited over 45 mins for it and the service was very poor.  Our waitress would ask us if we needed anything but never return with what we asked and seemed to not even recall the interaction.  Overall it is just ok but not special enough to justify the poor service."}
{"text":"It's places like Bob's that makes you forget about Denny's, IHOP, Eat N Park (although I do love ENP's whole grain pancakes) but, not Waffle House, that place will always have a place in my heart. 

Okay, let's get talking about Bob's, good coffee, that's what I judge a diner by, and Bob's has some good Joe. I had an egg white omelet with peppers, onions, and shrooms, whole wheat toast, and fresh fruit. The fruit was fresh sliced, mostly melon, nice and fresh. The toast was perfectly lite brown and the eggs were cooked through and benefitted from a few dashes of salt and pepper. The vegetables were cooked through. All and all a good meal. Next time I will ask if they make an oatmeal pancake or buck wheat and give them a try."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for a burger that was way overcooked and very salty.  Listened to the employees complain the entire time."}
{"text":"Got an omelette with feta ham and spinach. The ham was real ham off the bone. Not greasy at all. Very good. Mancini toast was great as always.

My wife got the fruit plate, which had a decent amount of fresh fruit on it. Her Mancini raisin was good as always."}
{"text":"While we've been to the Carnegie and Painters Run location several times, this was mine and my wife's first visit to Kennedy Township's. We like the atmosphere a lot better than Painters Run, because it's built and laid out like a true diner, with counter seating and booths right across from the open kitchen. We got there late Sunday morning and while they were busy, the waitress didn't make us wait long for anything (drinks, taking our order, bringing our food, etc.). I ordered a ham and cheese omelet which was typical Bob's quality (just the right amount cheese and fillings, mixed within the eggs, and not greasy at all). My wife's poached eggs were done just how she liked them, and bothered our orders of fruit were freshly cut. If we had to rank Bob's, it would be Carnegie, Kennedy, Painters Run."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, and while the food still isn't quite as good as the Painter's Run location, my wife and I really enjoy it. The atmosphere is always busy and provides plenty of people watching. I ordered an omelet with swiss, ham, mushroom and tomato, and it was a lot greasier than usual, but still good. My wife always orders poached eggs, well done, and for some reason they always come out runny. This time, they were perfect. 

Also, it's worth mentioning that Bob's is one of the few diners in the area that offers fruit, as a side and a fruit plate. The plate is huge, enough for two people, at least. And it's freshly cut.

If you want a local greasy breakfast diner, you'd be hard pressed to find a better spot than Bob's."}
{"text":"While I love their food, I continue to struggle with how bad the service is at times. For instance, I just walked in and sat at the counter wanting to place a to go order. Unfortunately, after sitting there for 5 mins and watching 3 different waitresses either walk by me or make eye contact and turn their head, I got up and walked out because nobody appeared to want to wait on me. 

This isn't a one time occurrence where I feel compelled to write, it's the fact that every time I go I feel like the service is awkward or bad. 

Their corn beef hash is THAT good that I put myself through this!  I'm going to try a different Bob's now. Hopefully the Painters Run Rd one will provide better service."}
{"text":"I haven't been in while but definitely enjoyed the meals I've had there. The omelette with toast and side of ham is really so much food. Enough to share with someone else for sure. It's  a typical diner look and feel. Everything you would expect in a modern day greasy spoon."}
{"text":"So the parking lot is far too small for their needs but other than that, this place was great.

This place was packed first thing on a Sunday morning yet the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. My husband ordered the Big Burrito, which was tasty. I opted for My Dad's Favorite, which included a bit everything. Everything was yummy and my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. But the home fries and pancake were incredible. The crust on the potatoes were perfection and very rarely can places achieve that perfect combination of crunchy outside but tender inside. And the Cookies and Cream pancake, which spanned the size of an entire dinner plate, was fluffy and just the right amount of sweet to wrap up the meal.

I do want to make it a point to again reiterate how pleasant the staff was because I think it set this experience over the top. Our server, Sammi (I believe) was so genuinely nice throughout our meal despite how hectic I'm sure her morning was going. Honestly, I'm excited to come back to the area sooner rather than later just to dine here."}
{"text":"Tried this place as wife and I were both looking to try another new diner for breakfast and we're heading from Wexford out to the ikea in Robinson this am

Worst of all diners we have tried to date:

1-5 with 5 being best

Service: 2 - pleasant bust extremely slow

Food Quality : 1 - Eggs served almost raw, potatoes semi cooked and swimming in oil 

Food Flavor: 1 - Potatoes covered in seasoned salt no crisp flavor and tasted mostly of oil

Food Quantity: 1 - see photo showing the special plate of eggs, home fries and toast - I estimated less than 1/2 of one potato -
PLEASE COMPARE THIS PHOTO TO MY OTHER REVIEWS SUCH AS NANCY'S and DAVE's to see a real world comparison"}
{"text":"Went to Bob's while on a Business trip to Pittsburgh. Decided I wanted a place to have breakfast that wasn't pretentious, had good food and good service. Bob's Diner certainly delivered! You absolutely must try the traditional french toast!"}
{"text":"Carnegie needed something like this. A great little diner and good food. The pancakes are huge and tasty."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food and really nice staff. Large menu with lots of options. Keeps me coming back for more! I recommend it to everyone in the area. The only detractor is the parking, but even that doesn't stop me."}
{"text":"This is my first time getting breakfast at Bobs with my family. It was very good and we had a pleasant experience. Service and staff was friendly. I had coffee and the biscuits, gravy, and turkey sausage. Everything tasted great. If I could add anything I would say that there could be a little bit more gravy on my biscuits and I think the biscuits could have been a bit warmer. But overall, I really enjoyed the food. My parents had omelettes and both also enjoyed their meals. We all left full! We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and it was very good! They have Mancini's bread which makes everything better. Service was great. Looks like they get a lot of regulars which is a good sign. They cook in front of the counter on the flat grill. The foodie in me is giving them 4 stars. The prior restaurant manager in me would give them less based on cleanliness. The floors in the kitchen area looked like they hadn't seen a mop in a while."}
