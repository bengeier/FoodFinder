{"text":"Been here a four times for lunch. Love the food every time I go. The Pork Roll is amazing. The Staff is very friendly and the food comes out pretty fast. There's always enough food to take home for dinner so it's a great value."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, large portions, reasonable price, I've tried many different plates and liked each one of them."}
{"text":"Nothing really special, bourbon chicken was good (not great) and so was the chow mein."}
{"text":"Tott's is our new favorate place for Asian food.  I ordered the Sweet and Sour Orange Shrimp along with the chow mein noodles.  There were actually 10 large shrimp in the delicious dish.  Wonderful orange peel flavor and was brought to our table in less than five minutes after being made fresh to order.  My wife ordered the Korean style chicken with the medium spicy sauce which was also cooked to perfection.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Highly recommend this jewel in the rough and am looking forward to trying the wide selections of dishes offered."}
{"text":"Besides the food being delicious and prepare as ordered! The staff and owner are warm, friendly and charming."}
{"text":"Descent food, fast food vibe, huge portions  ... will repeat again ... also staff knowledgeable about the menu and place is a little but very clean."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews here (which are pretty mixed) and decided to give it a shot. We ordered the Singapore noodles, pork rolls, crab wontons and yellow curry veggies.
Singapore noodles-so salty! Flavor was decent but I couldn't get past the taste of salt.
pork rolls-in my opinion, way too large with filling that is too chewy and hardly any pork. Mostly cabbage.  Pork that was present was chewy and dry.
crab wontons-decent but was sweet tasting, which I don't prefer. That's what the sweet and sour sauce is for.
Curry vegetables-loved the mixture of eggplant, peppers, onions, carrots etc. Was not overcooked which is where many other places make the mistake with vegetarian dishes. Curry sauce however, was massively disappointing. Not enough curry and too much corn starch to \"thicken\" the sauce. No no no.
ordering process was easy and food was ready when promised. 2 stars for this and for not over - cooking the vegetables as well as the generous portions. 
Most likely won't be back. I don't know why it's so difficult to find acceptable Chinese food in this area. Boo :("}
{"text":"I went last night with my family based on the reviews and we enjoyed it.  We had pork rolls, orange chicken, orange tofu, and Mandarin Veggies.  Nice portions and good flavor and the owner was greeting and talking to regulars.

Will go back again soon."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out Tott's after hearing so many good things about it, but now it is doubful I will be returning..

Here's the thing, the only vegetarian item on the menu is the Szechuan Tofu and Vegetables. A dish that is \"meh\" at best. 

All the others have either chicken powder (WTF?), oyster sauce or both, thus making 'em not suitable for vegetarians.

Also: Was told the spicy tofu was veg the first time I tried Tott's. Found out it was not on the second.

The bummer is, these are ingredients that could easily be subbed or omitted.

Nowadays, the vast majority of Chinese restaurants are very accommodating to (the growing population of) vegetarians. It is easy to substitute meat with tofu and have the kitchen leave the animal ingredients out. Tott's fails to make the effort.

If you are in the area and are looking for great take-out Chinese that is super accommodating to vegetarians, than I recommend a certain \"Express\" not too far North of Tott's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When we went to place our orders the owner rushed us through ordering so we did not have time to even think about what we were getting. The owner said that the wallnut shrimp was lightley breaded and was simalar to tbe shrimp that we wanted which they were out of. Once the shrimp came out it was lying on an unappetizing bed of dry, crusty rice noodeles. The shrimp was very heavily breaded WAY to sweet. It was Covered in a thick, mayonaise-like sause. It was simply a dish that nobody could eat. When we told the owner of the store that it was something that we could not eat  he took the plates and slammed them together leaving the the rice noodeles all over the tables and in our drinks. What was originally  going to be an enjoyable family dinner ended up being a list of complaints.  The forturne cookies and water were the only things to be looked apon with optimisim."}
{"text":"When my friend found out I was visiting Arizona, she wanted me to visit her brother's restaurant:  Tott's Asian Diner.

Unfortunately, when I came, I wasn't able to see Yun on the day that I dined there, but I still enjoyed my visit.  They had an assortment of noodle dishes you can order from all over:  Japanese, Singapore, Korean, Hong Kong, Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Bangkok, and Malaysian styles to name a few.  Lots of reasonably priced appetizers and curry dishes.

We ordered during dinner with appetizers so it was over $10 a person, but their lunch specials are generally around $6-8/person.  We had Pork Roll (YUMMY!! I recommend this!!), Tom Yum Soup (tasty, but we won't order it again), Lemon Chicken (Yummy for the many tender cubed pieces of white meat chicken.), and the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodle (HUGE bowl of dry curry noodle.  It was good :) ).

One more thing, if you're looking to try this place out, it's next door to Starbucks."}
{"text":"It's not bad Asian food. I'll tell you this...you'll probably enjoy your lunch more over here with your buddy than across the way at Pei-Wei. It's not as crowded, therefore the noise level is conducive to gossiping or business talks. The Bourbon chicken is pretty good, and I personally like the Malaysian chicken, made with a dry curry sauce...oh boy, was it spicy...but the good kind. 

Yun (the manager or the owner? not sure) is just too friendly and funny. If you don't see something in the menu, or you want to combine a number of things from the menu...just ask Yun if he can accomodate. And he most likely can hook you up with what you are craving for."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Wow. I may not be able to go to another Chinese restaurant and not compare them to Totts. The flavors are terrific. The atmosphere is  great. I cannot stop raving about this place to my friends. You want Chinese? Go here. Discussion over."}
{"text":"Amazing Asian food! I love the curry noodles with tofu most but the orange chicken is amazing! The owner is really friendly and the food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Asian diner. I am a vegetarian and this place gives me options. The food quality has always been great and it is service with a smile."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I always get the sesame chicken! It's my favorite. This place has a really nice atmosphere and the owner is very nice as well"}
{"text":"Nice Asian fusion place. A lot of vegetarian options are available. Portion sizes are generous. Tofu and vegetables in few different flavors make both lunch and dinner options very affordable."}
{"text":"This is a nice asian take-out style restaurant (you can order and sit down too). The portions are pretty big, and they have a good selection. WAAAAAAY better than Pei Wei which is in the same shopping center. 

The only downside is their breading is a little heavy, but other than that I have enjoyed everything I have tried there."}
{"text":"First time my family & I ate here 10/10/15 we were very satisfied! Lemon chicken, orange chicken & Thai mix curry... all were very good. Fast & friendly service, food came out hot & fresh. Would definitely go again. The General Manager made sure we were well taken care of,  good service.  Nice mom & pop feel!"}
{"text":"The food is good quality and the place is clean, making this a good spot for a 30 minute lunch.  While the food is actually pretty good I have a hard time over 3 stars because all of the dishes come out having very similar texture.  Every dish I tried had the standard americanized thick sweet sauce, so every item came out similar.  When you are in the mood for that style Chinese food, you should go here, but don't expect anything more."}
{"text":"tom  yum noodle soup (tofu and veggies).
served with anglehair noodles, mushroom, tofu, bean sprouts, and other veggies.

I got a HUGE bowl for 7.50 or less,
I ended up taking home about half my bowl and I got another meal out of it.

Order took less than 4 min,
Staff was attentive, helpful and friendly.
Facility was clean.

Seems like manager/owner actually cares about his customers.

I also liked the sweet and pungent chicken.
Served with a big bowl of rice.


I would def recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Update:  March 2011 - This restaurant closed. I'm not sure if they moved or went out of business. McClintock & Guadalupe, Tempe

My husband told me about Tott's. He said the reviews were very good and he'd like to try. I had no interest for a long time, but the other day we went for dinner.

The food is a bit different than regular asian restaurants.  It is in the same center as Pei Wei and the food comparable. The atmosphere doesn't compare to Pei Wei, but that's not a factor most of the time. I ordered a crispy noodle dish with veggies & chicken.  It was yummy.  The thing that struck me was that they used fresh, fresh veggies - like right out of the produce truck fresh.  Everything was bright and crunchy and the mushrooms were fresh, big slices of yummy mushrooms. It wasn't super packed but there were a ton of pick up orders.  The place is clean, the cooks were clean, the food is clean. I will go here again."}
{"text":"Been going here since they open on the corner of McClintock and East Guadalupe in Tempe. Absolutely the Best fresh Chinese you'll find anywhere. 

The owner is very friendly and greets and chats with most customers. If you become a repeat customer, expect to be greeted with a welcoming smile.  

It's unfortunate that he lost the lease in Tempe just after the 1st of the year, but they are open again at their new location  4030 W Ray Rd E1, Chandler, AZ 

Stop by and give them a try you won't be disappointed.

Update 1/16/13
Since moving the portions have shrunk, the prices have risen and the quality also has slipped."}
{"text":"This place was ruff on my stomach, I got the yellow curry here.  I heard about this place on yelp because me and my friend wanted some chinese food.  

Well the place is clean and my friend said that his dish (Orange Chicken) was just ok,  After I was done eating I felt my stomach screaming 'WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN YOUR FRIEND'.  

There is also a pei wei in the same area and I wish we just went to them because it is a bit better quality then this place.

I even had it a couple hours later after the meal cold, and I dont even know why I just felt like giving it another shot, but nope it was still making my insides hurt.  

Recommendation: I would try somewhere else unless you hate your stomach,and if you do, try something else then the curry."}
{"text":"Delicious Asian food ranging from 4 different kinds of curry, a variety of stir frys, and local favorites like pad thai and orange chicken (which has been voted best orange chicken in the valley multiple times). Definitely better then Pei Wei and always excellent customer service. They really will make it EXACTLY how you want it.

I'd suggest the Hot Korean, Stir-Fry Crispy Beef, the Wonton Soup, or the Cantonese Chow Mein. Tell Young Rachael sent you. :)"}
{"text":"After walking into two different Asian restaurants at ten minutes to 9pm (their closing time) and being denied a sit down meal, we took a third chance and walked into Tott's.  The owner was extremely accommodating and allowed us to sit on the patio and eat on real plates versus to-go's and told us he'd be there cleaning and finalizing some things and to take our time.  I am in sales and have a keen sense of customer service and was thrilled to learn that Tott's Asian Diner not only delivers fresh, great tasting food, but exceptional service too.  Keep up the great work!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just tried them today. I would have to say that I would be really impressed with everything if I wouldn't have had an issue with my food. I got the honey walnut shrimp and it tasted as if it had been fried/cooked in old oil. It had a terrible after taste. I stopped eating it, it was that bad. I contacted the restaurant and Summer began defending the oil, stating that the oil is changed every day and my complaint had her scratching her head as to how this could happen. I was shocked at her defensiveness and thought to call and soak with a higher Manager in the morning as I felt I would get no where with her. 

If customer service is their focus, she didn't meet that expectation for me."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  The first time, I ate in and had the pan-fried noodle, which I was hoping would be like that of OB Noodle House in San Diego.  But it wasn't quite the same.  It will do as an Arizona substitute though.  

The second time, I ordered to go.  Orange shrimp.  I couldn't decide between it and the Singapore Rice Noodle plate, but ended up going with Orange Shrimp.  The sauce was pretty sweet, but the shrimp was crispy and not too spicy.  The chow mein was decent too, but not many veggies.  The Spring Rolls were pretty good - nice and crispy.  So my only complaint on this visit was the lack of veggies in the chow mein.

My order was ready quickly and the staff was nice.  Another good spot nearby is Wang's Delight which is diagonal across the Ray/McClintock intersection."}
{"text":"Great place! Glad I moved around the corner from Tott's in South Tempe.
I used to go to Tott's all of the time when I worked around the corner from their old location on Guadalupe/McClintock. When our company moved, I stopped going so I am glad I found them again! 

Awesome Food and Great Service! Young has always been really nice and so has the other staff.

The Highlights for me:
- Great Service! The staff has always been really polite and friendly
- The food is always Excellent and the price is really good for the portion you get. 
- Egg Drop Soup (only $2) - Always Piping hot and doesn't have nearly as much Sodium as other Asian places.
- Kung Pao Chicken - Great flavors, not too saucy and the Chili Peppers have a smoky flavor that I can probably pop them on its own all-day long. 
- The Curries - Bangkok & Singapore are really good! I usually get the Chicken or Beef and a side of brown rice. Much better then the local Thai restaurants who serve Curries. 

Overall, Glad I found them again and Keep banging out Quality food and great service!"}
{"text":"Customer service is great, the owner is pretty much always working.  i HIGHLY recommend the spicy chicken pad thai.  It is way better than Pei Wei's and you get like 2x as much.  They also offer lunch specials which are legit.

5+ stars"}
{"text":"I go to totts almost as much as I go to my kitchen...never had a bad meal, and it's fun to see employees from pei wei eating there"}
{"text":"This food was great. I don't see what anybody has to fuss about. It was so fresh, the portions so generous.... I'm going back.
The prices were a little steep, and with this past time being my first, left me a little uncomfortable seeing that I only had a slight idea what I was getting into. 
All in all it's worth going to. The guy inside was really nice and chased me down in my car to give me a 10% off coupon, so his heart is in a good place looking out for me and my stomach."}
{"text":"Generally positive, though some non-favorable instances.

~(lunch) teriyaki chicken seemed average

--(lunch) dan dan noodles with added broccoli - I did not enjoy this (addition of vegetable), because it cost $1 to add broccoli but I got a very sparse amount of veggie for it, a few small sprigs/cloves of broccoli, maybe like an ounce or less.  Lowered my opinion of the restaurant a fair amount such that I considered not coming back (and I tell others not to add veggies bc of this).

+(lunch) kung pao chicken was tasty with a variety of veggies

++(dinner with date) dan dan noodles, similar to before but without added vegetable issue:  good flavor, but also pretty strong and spicy, but also gets a bit bland over time (could maybe use veggies or some other things with it to diversify the flavor).  The girl that came with on the date ordered some green tea with her food, and Tott's graciously refilled it for free a couple of times for her. This generosity helped changed my review of this place to generally positive.  My date and I ended up sharing some really good conversation and times, such that I am hopeful we can come back together again someday."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Tott's. On average I eat there once a week and I have yet to have a bad experience. The food is great, the building is clean and inviting, and the staff is very friendly.  What is more, Tott's offer student and military discounts; they even employ a ginger! Humanitarianism like that really plucks my liberal heartstrings?  Judging by the crowd that always seems to be there, and indeed, the reviews here; it appears I'm not the only southern Tempe local to have discovered this gem. If you find yourself craving Asian food in Tempe, you would be wise to skip the Pei Wei located in the same lot, and try Tott's. 

Besides, everyone knows Pei Wei is a relationship killer."}
{"text":"Tott's Asian Diner is my family's favorite lunch spot. The food is fantastic and the service is outstanding. The owner is so friendly and really makes an effort to make sure you're happy. I have never ordered a dish I was unhappy with and they also happily make accommodations to their menu items for those of us with allergies, which is much appreciated. I would definitely recommend a visit to Tott's next time you're in the mood for some yummy Asian food."}
{"text":"Tott's gets five stars from me -- not as in 3 Michelin stars -- but as in \"this place is perfect for what it's supposed to be.\"  

And what is it supposed to be?  Asian fast food, dine-in / take-out.

And why is it perfect at being that?  For starters:

- excellent recipes, delicious menu, lots of variety
- top-notch ingredients (no fatty meats & bright, crisp veggies)
- very generous portions (the dinner portions = 1.5 to 2 meals)
- clean (including the restrooms)
- friendly staff (managed by Yan (Yun?), the owner's brother-in-law)
- the Bourbon Chicken, Twins Pork, and Dan Dan Noodles (yes, they deserver their very own bullet point)

The first time my fiancee and I ate at Tott's, it lasted for 3 days.  We went on a Sunday and ordered the Bourbon Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles with Beef.  They were so delicious, but the portions were so huge we got to eat the left-overs for lunch the next day.

Of course, when dinner rolled around, we were dying to try more of the Tott's menu...so we did.  The next day?  Repeat.  Pretty much nothing but Tott's right on thru Tuesday.

Yan, the manager, is a very friendly person, who obviously cares about the restaurant.  He takes the product and the service very seriously.  I'm sure he's a big reason why this restaurant is so spot-on.

I can't believe this place has been around for four years (as of this writing), and I've only just now discovered it.  If you haven't discovered it yet, do yourself a favor and order yourself some Bourbon Chicken asap.

Check out the web site (http://tottsasiandiner.com/section.html) to see the menu and pricing.

Did I mention the Bourbon Chicken?"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. It's cozy but nice to eat in, and does great for takeout too. Great chicken fried rice and everything else too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am SO HAPPY Tott's has come back so quickly!  Still the best Asian food in town.  Judging by the crowd most of Mr. Young's regulars are finding their way back."}
{"text":"I've been to Totts a few times now. I've dined in and carried out. I really enjoy the food here. I've tried a few different items, but my favorite dish is the Pan Fried Noodles served with beef.  The mixture of the noodles covered with beef, veggies and the oyster sauce is terrific. This item is FANTASTIC in my opinion! Each time I finish the dish, I wish I had more! 

The staff is super nice and always go over your order to make sure you receive the items you requested.

One item that I've tried that I wasn't keen on was the Tom Yum Soup. The soup was spicy, but was about it. Nothing filling about it.

The food has always came quickly when I've dined in. Both times I've picked up for carryout, the food was ready as advertised. The food is usually ready for pick up within 10 minutes of your order. 

The prices are very reasonable. Each main dish is generally between $6.50 and $9.00. Items with seafood will be a bit more expensive, maybe a bit over the $9 mark

A very good meal for under $10 (excluding drink)"}
{"text":"This restaurant just moved into my neighborhood. I like to support mom and pop shops. The menu and style of food reminded me of Pei Wei's, but just a little more authentic. They serve the more popular dishes from various Asian countries (Pad Thai, beef broccoli, orange chicken,  teriaki chicken, etc.).  I've tried at least one dish from each country and they were alright. You get a good portion size. As for price, it's slightly above average. The service is great, and food comes out fast. The restaurant space is small, so it's not great for large parties. One of the owners is always present, and works hard. I'll eat here on occasion."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place.... Fast, close to home, and great Yelp reviews.  Alas, it was not to be...
Got the Red Curry lunch with veggies, tofu, and brown rice. They had a great variety of veggies and they were cooked perfectly. Not limp, crispy without being too raw. Brown rice was perfectly cooked as well. Trouble was the curry. There was a layer of sauce on the veggies, as opposed to it swimming in curry. Which would have been fine except that there was a gritty texture, no silky coconut milk, no hint of fish sauce, and NO FLAVOR. There was not even a hint of heat, nor any other discernible spice notes. When has a curry ever been bland? I'm the wrong person to ask. I guess.
I also tried the chicken pot stickers. They wrappers had a weird texture, the filling was super bland, and the sauce they came with was just thin, sweet, and totally forgettable. 

Decor was inviting, it seemed clean, and the staff seemed fine (ordered carry out, my order was waiting for me when I got there, both the guy on the phone and the gal on the register seemed competent & friendly-ish)...
I may be back the next time my son bugs me for Pei Wei. :)"}
{"text":"Yum
Yum.... This place is definitely delicious I would recommend it to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, fairly cheap.  I had the Orange chicken and it was good. Liked the brown rice option.   I enjoyed this $6.19 meal much more than the lame sandwich/soup I had at Great Grains yesterday and that cost me $12.25,  I'll be back to Tott's."}
{"text":"Tott's is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations and offers a medley of Asian flavors. The dishes are large so they're perfect to split if you come with a group and I recommend that you do just that. 

The service is fast. The food is delicious and the owner is extremely sweet. We've been coming there for years so on occasion, he'll bring us an extra dish to sample like the amazing Walnut Shrimp.

Some of my favorites are the Kung Pao and Orange Chicken. I also recently had the Bourbon Chicken, which is out of sight. If you haven't been here, check it out. Support this mom-and-pop establishment opposed to a chain like Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Pei Wei, has still more to learn, Totts Dan Dan noodles Rock! better quality and flavor.  If your lucky to live or Work in Tempe, AZ you gotta give this place a try, you'll get hooked, and save $$$ too."}
{"text":"My goal here is a PSA to VEGETARIANS...  

The menu at Totts seems to have a significant vegetarian menu, but eater beware that here, fish sauce, shrimp paste, eggs, and CHICKEN powder, is considered vegetarian.  You are best off asking for a \"vegan\" option.  ( I think there is only one).  

I think I eventually got  the Spicy Szechuan with tofu/veggies. The portion was huge, the veggies were fresh.  It tasted ok. The restaurant is clean. The server / host staff was very nice.  The owner, I am truly disappointed in. 

I got there, ordered what I presumed was vegetarian (asked if sauce had shrimp/fish paste -they said no).  Afterwards, I asked if the curries had fish/shrimp paste, and she said yes, and asked if I had an issue with animal byproducts, because the dish I had ordered, has CHICKEN powder in it.  Apparently they consider Chicken powder to be vegetarian.  Fine, whatever, we have different definitions. I appreciated that the woman went back to grab my ticket / ask if I could get the dish without it / what I could get instead. 

Next the owner came over to me, and got really upset!  All I asked him, was to clarify what on their menu, did not have any animal byproducts.  His response was that your people come in here all the time and have different definitions of vegetarian.  This is my restaurant, and yes, here this is what I call vegetarian.  Fine, I'll agree to disagree on the definition of vegetarian, but by no means, as the owner should he have YELLED at me for inquiring what he considered to be vegetarian / what they had that did not have animal products in it.  

If we had not already paid, I would have left.  

So while, the place is clean, staff was nice, food was ok, the owner/GM was outright rude, and had extremely POOR customer service.  For that I go out of my way to write a review, give you a 1, and tell ALL OF MY VEGETARIAN friends to avoid your restaurant.  

Thanks for the unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"I moved to the valley about a year and a half ago, and first tried Tott's when they were still at the old location.  What a great find it was, I tend to stick to the stir fry crispy beef, but have had quite a few other items.  This is just one of those places that does everything to near perfection.  Tott's will set the bar so high others will just fall short."}
{"text":"Fast food asian. Not great, but probably a step up from panda. Eh"}
{"text":"I went for the first time today to Tott's at lunchtime.  It was excellent.  The service was friendly and accommodating (they had no problem substituting my rice for broccoli) and the food was fabulous.  It came to our table very quickly and everything was hot, nicely seasoned and very fresh (love crisp broccoli!)  I can see why this place is so busy/popular.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Same concept as Pei Wei but tastier, fresher fast casual Chinese food. Lots of vegetarian options. Usually get takeout & employees are fast & friendly."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service.  We eat there 25% of the time and the other 75% get our order to go or phone it in to go.  Everything is always fresh and tasty and the owner is super nice.  They know our daughter loves fortune cookies and will toss in a few extra for her.  

If you want them to alter you order, no problem.  The employees are all great and really care that your order is how YOU want it.

Five stars."}
{"text":"The were fantastic!! Had them cater our company lunch and the food was hot, on time and delicious!!  Will be calling them again to bring us food!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I regularly go to Tott's for lunch with a group of friends.  The service is always great.  The manager is extremely friendly.  The food is fabulous as well, with huge portions.  I typically order from the kid's menu and that is just the right size for a reasonable lunch - and I can't beat the price.  It usually comes out to around $4 plus a tip. Most of the time the food is ready as I get to the table or only a few moments later."}
{"text":"Tott's is this amazing little neighborhood Asian restaurant that has quickly become a favorite of mine!
The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!
This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 
1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.
I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry \"panang\" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.
I must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's.
Tott's even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license."}
{"text":"Great food! Polite staff! I go out of my way for Totts Asian food,  I live in South Phoenix, lunch is fantastic. I had dinner there last evening! If you've never been, you're missing out, lol"}
{"text":"Really really good asian food. Big portions, 2 could dine for less than $15.  Beef pad thai so full of flavour, in fact all the food is rich with flavour.  Best chinese food in Chandler, Arizona. IMHO"}
{"text":"Now this is what I'm talking about. Really good stuff here with large portions!  Make my
visit to Pei Wei looking like a kids meal. Staff was very nice and professional. I think I saw the owner milling around as well.  Always a good sign!   Go Cowboys!"}
{"text":"Everything tastes over processed. Very disappointed with the orange chicken and walnut shrimp. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Totts for years now and still love it. The quality of the food is great with an extremely clean atmosphere and very friendly staff. In all the years I've been coming here there have only been a couple times where my food was unsatisfactory. When I mentioned it to either the owner or staff they got me a new order ASAP. I highly recommend this establishment if you're looking for great tasting food for quick dine-in or take out."}
{"text":"Omg so good and huge servings!  The chefs specialty shrimp dish us my favorite."}
{"text":"Well, this marks the last time I visit Pei Wei. Better, faster, higher quality. Now, if I could but order online, and also convince my super trendy friends to jump the fence to where the grass is truly greener. 5 stars of win!"}
{"text":"Me and my family were in the neighborhood, so we decided to why not try this place. It seems to have good reviews overall. Contradictory to other reviews, the food tastes bland. All we can taste was the sticky greasy noodles, pepper sauce. We also ordered sesame chicken and orange chicken. I can say that I'd rather go to Panda express then, at least they use chicken breast. It was pure dark fatty batter coated  sesame and orange chicken!  We were so hungry, that we decided to just deal with it (it was horrible!!)  and never come back to this place ever again. Besides, you'll never know till you try,  right? And some people compare this place to Peiwei? NO, Not even close!"}
{"text":"If it was possible to give this place no stars I would. After moving to chandler from phoenix recently, my family and I had been searching for a great place to eat Chinese food in town. After reading the many great reviews on Tott's Asian diner my family and I decided to give this place a try. We ordered 3 plates of orange chicken with steamed rice and fried rice and also 2 pork egg rolls. The total came out to around $31.00. It was the most DISAPPOINTING Chinese food we have EVER tried in our entire lives. It literally made all of us sick to our stomachs after forcing ourselves to eat at least half of it since we paid for it. It was very very dry and the meat was extremely chewy. I had to chew it 100 times in my mouth because I felt like I would choke if I hadn't. The taste was stale and the fried rice was rubbery and lacked flavor. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Waste of money and left my family and I feeling nauseous!"}
{"text":"Good and fresh. I like that they have a kid's meal.  This is the only Asian food place I have seen that has one."}
{"text":"Been going to Tott's Asian Diner for years.  Recommend the Thai Pineapple Fried Rice - order extra spicy!  Extremely friendly service!"}
{"text":"I love Tott's. The atmosphere almost makes me feel at home and the guys always working the counter?-- An absolutely wonderful man who always talks to everybody and walks around checking that everything's okay. It's worth it to go just to see his smiling face! But then again, there's the food which is cheap and delicious. Right around Panda Express prices but so much better-- everything feels and tastes fresher and better. The veggies are crisp. The meat is flavorful and good. Sauces are thick and delicious. I can't stress enough that you should try this place. Don't go to Pei Wei. Support this guy and his wonderful Asian food."}
{"text":"I'm eating here at Tott's for the first time in two years since moving back to California. Based solely on the Walnut Shrimp and the Sesame Chicken, this is the best (and affordable) Chinese food that I've ever had. These guys took the best tastes of San Francisco Chinese food and brought them mto the desert. It's so good and affordable that it doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"Since getting a job, nearby, I've eaten at Tott's a handful of times. Having only 30 minutes to eat, I can walk in, order, eat, and leave with a few minutes to spare to get back to work. I highly recommend the Sesame Chicken. The food is great (big portions too), they're fast, and the owner is very personable and friendly!"}
{"text":"I have to say that we were not impressed.  My husband's dish (which was supposed to be vegetarian, came with chicken) was flavorless.  Vegetables were all right, fairly fresh.  I ordered the lemon chicken and it was over-cooked (so it was that stringy but tough fried chicken) and the broccoli seemed like it fell off of the truck and then was over-cooked.  The lo mein was all right as a side dish.  Sorry - but we won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Awesome. Pure awesome. 

Food is great. Place is clean. Staff is friendly. 

What else do you need? We have eaten here for years (at old location too) and owner is always friendly asking about family etc and remembers your \"usual\". Food quality is consistent and at a high level always."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried on this menu is DELICIOUS! Affordable, clean and the BEST customer service! Once you have eaten here you will FORGET about PF Changs, Pei Wei, Panda Express...and don't forget to try their lettuce wraps! Yum!"}
{"text":"If I would have drafted a review after the first time I went here, it would have been a 5-star declaration. But, after going here a few more times, it kind of loses its luster a bit with each subsequent visit. 

One thing unique about this place can say is it's unintentional comedic irony. What am I talking about, you say? Most family owned Asian places have the tacky fake crystal lights and generic table and chairs but this place has attempted to go in a different but equally unoriginal direction by copying every detail of the interior of a Pei Wei Asian Diner! It's actually pretty hilarious once you think about it because there is literally a Pei Wei accross the parking lot from this place.

On to the plate, Ive ordered few different things but tend to order the \"famous\" orange chicken more often than anything. It is pretty good but the chicken is so breaded and the sauce so thick and flavor-neutral (if thats even a term, if not then Im making it one), that it I find myself bored with the dish after a few bites. I've gotten it with brown and fried rice, I'd say go with the brown because the fried rice is bland. One time, I attempted to liven up the orange chicken dish and asked them to add long beans to it, that was a mistake. The long beans are rubbery and cold and flavorless. 

I'll continue to go here but not as frequently. I wish I could say I'd found a place to permanently keep me out of Pei Wei but looks like this place will only sway me every once in a while."}
{"text":"It's usually great food just lately it's been inconsistent had lunch just the other day and it was subpar, The chicken in the sweet and sour chicken was chewy and way over cooked, the vegetables in my other dish seemed old and not at all fresh."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this spot quite a bit. It's not bad, the orange chicken is probably the best thing on the menu. for some reason, it tastes terrible when heated though. I'm not too sure why. Other than that the dude who owns the place is a good dude and he will hook you with big portions."}
{"text":"Tott's is as good as you can get for Chinese/Indonesian/Fusion takeout. I had first ordered the Curry fried rice with pineapple and it tasted exactly like how my dad makes it so I was impressed. Every time I go I get something different and I am never disappointed. If you ever want to go to Pei Wei or whatever  \"Asian Fusion\" places are popular, just go to Tott's. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"If your looking for the best Asian food then this is the place! I used to live across the street and come once a week but no make the trip across town from Mesa just to eat here. Can't beat the price on the Dine-In special for two either. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Totts is great food always fresh, hot, fast, and consistent.. I eat here all the time.. service is great  always friendly.."}
{"text":"My family and I love Totts! Lots of options and everything I've had has been amazing! I usually order the Hong Kong stir fry and my husband gets the Kung Pao. Both dishes come with mushrooms, which we don't eat, but the staff is very accommodating and will sub out the mushrooms for carrots, broccoli, whatever. Our daughter likes to watch the cooks making the food right there - lots going on for her to watch. Since we have a little one we probably eat a little earlier than others, but we always find a table inside when we dine in. Take out is great too though- hot food in separate dishes with lots of rice. We live about 20 minutes away and will drive there for their great Asian food over other places near us! Get over to Totts if you haven't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients used to make food fast, and always piping hot.  This has been a go-to location for me for years.  It's not your traditional \"everything is battered in MSG and fried\" kind of Chinese place.  Top items are Kung Pao anything, Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken.

Customer service here is also impeccable.  The owner is seemingly always on the premises and is concerned about the quality of your meal.  In fact, I see the same employees year after year, so I imagine he treats them as well as the customers."}
{"text":"This is the very best place to get Singapore Rice noodles!  All the dishes are amazing but the Chinese here is the best. It isn't bland and greasy like most places. Totts is clean and the staff is super sweet. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been going to TOTS now for five or more years with a group of friends. We usually go on Friday nights and the owner is always there to greet us with a smile. The entire staff is friendly and they make a point of letting us know they're glad we are there. 

Excellent food, very fair prices, and family owned. Hard to beat this place."}
{"text":"Really great food! The orange chicken is a bit sweet so order the bourbon chicken and mix it up! So delicious! Much better than Pei Wei!!"}
{"text":"I think I've gone to every \"rating\" site/app at this point to tout this AMAZING place. They are - with no competition - one of the best places in Tempe/Chandler. I've never had a bad meal, the service is spot on, and WOW is the taste out of this world. I recommend highly to friends, family, strangers, tourists...etc."}
{"text":"Really good and quick Asian food! Food here is consistent. No matter when you come, food always tastes good. My personal favorite here is dragon noodles."}
{"text":"I love this place. Has awesome food and menu is easy to use. Mr young, the owner is always there and he is so welcoming and nice. The food is cooked right when you order it. I just love this place!"}
{"text":"Good sized servings, good customer service, and very clean. Fresh food and tastes great. The walnut shrimp is really good."}
{"text":"OMG TOTT'S IS BACK?! thank you Yelpers for letting me know. I found out Tott's left when I went on Yelp to leave an awesome, overdue review. Let me just say that I was devastated when they closed down and every time I craved chinese food, I thought about Tott's and fell into a slight depression. 

This place is amazing because of the food and the very friendly customer service. The food is delicious and does not leave you with that \" i ate so much, i need to throw up\" feeling. The food isn't dripping with grease like most asian places.

The owner is such a nice man. I came here often when I was pregnant and everything sounded so good, I couldn't stop ordering. The owner (who i call Mr. Totts) would tell me to not order so much because the servings were so big. LOL who does that? He made me stop spending money, I appreciated that. Anyways, even after I had the baby, he still recognized us and remembered what we usually ordered. I love that. 

Thanks for coming back to us Tott's. Life is complete again."}
{"text":"Food: Bourbon Chicken

This was tasty and plentiful. The chicken comes with some greens and a choice of rice. The sauce added to the flavor without drowning the rest of the ingredients. My lunch companions all enjoyed what they ordered, and the majority had leftovers to take with them.

Service: Outstanding

The owner saw that a group of people had arrived, and he made sure that we could sit together, even though all six of us were ordering separately. He was very friendly to us and answered any questions we had.

Atmosphere: Everything is pretty basic in terms of furnishings and design, but it has everything a restaurant of this type needs. There are umbrellas and space heaters outside.

Tott's delivers on taste, comfort, and value. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Tott's is great pan-Asian food for a very reasonable price.  

One day at work one of my co-workers asked if I wanted to go out to lunch.  I agreed and we set out.  We each got 1 veto.  Hers was Panda Express, mine was Kyoto Bowl.  We kept driving and she remembered Tott's, and I've never bothered going to Panda again.

Great food and great service.  The owner is a small Asian man who smiles a lot and always wants to know if he can get us anything else.  I see him every time I go.

Everyone I go with loves their orange chicken.  It is very tasty, but a little on the sweet side for me.  I like a spicy dish, so I go with the Malaysian Curry.  Chicken, red curry, fresh veggies, fried rice.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Been twice now, owner and counter service very friendly.  The food is ok when you have a need for Chinese American food fix.  Deep fried items are REALLY deep fried... small-ish crunchy bits of chicken kind of thing."}
{"text":"Great Americanized Chinese food. The food is amazing for the price. Beats Pei-Wei and Panda when it comes to food quality and value.

I'm a regular here."}
{"text":"Happily surprised!   The food was fast and fresh. The service was GREAT!   The owner knows quite a few people by name and greets them as they come in.  Everyone that works the counter is very nice, didn't expect this level of service.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!!!!!! Looking for an Asian inspired cuisine? This is THE place!!! I love how any option can be made vegetarian and their tofu is out of this world. My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place and I refused to eat at any other Asian style unless it's Tott's! Try the Hawaiian style tofu and vegetables you will not be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! Best place in the Valley for sure! Young, the owner and his staff are super nice and friendly! We usually get the Orange Chicken (which is made with dark meat), egg rolls and pad Thai  and it is AMAZING!! After coming here, I don't want to go to any other Chinese Restaurants. It is all reasonably priced and large portions. Thank you for such amazing food!"}
{"text":"I have eatten take out from here 3-4 times and I have not been impressed. I really like Chinese and Thai food but this just doesn't measure up. I swear I got sick from it one time."}
{"text":"I had the pad Thai and the orange chicken. I thought that the orange chicken was moist, but over breaded with not enough chicken on the inside. The pad Thai was okay at first but really grew on me. I think it tasted a bit smokey, and a different flavor than I am used to with pad Thai dishes."}
{"text":"Always perfect and fresh EVERY time!  I LOVE the Hong Kong Chicken."}
{"text":"I called ahead and ordered Chicken Phad Thai for take out. 
I walked in and they immediately knew who I was and what I had ordered (I guess wearing my name tag helped), but it was a wonderful personal touch. 
The staff here is so friendly! 
The take out lunch portion is huge! They put the peanuts on the side so you can add or omit as much as you like. There is a giant wedge of lemon inside the container. Use it! it adds a delicious pop to the flavor. The chicken is very tender and the sauce has a great flavor. I added a little extra spice for my taste. The noodles were a little softer than I normally like, but the dish overall was so yummy! 

Welcome to Chandler TOTT's! I will be seeing you often!!"}
{"text":"Always love this place The food is always tasty here love the panfried rice noodles Hong Kong style! The restaurant is always kept well clean and friendly folks that will help you decide on your order. The Kung pao chicken and my spring rolls were delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Asian Food in AZ!   From the smiles that great you as you walk in, to the FAST, FRESH, YUMMMY food you can never go wrong with TOTT's!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not as cheap as Panda Express, but that's the point. 

If you want a good, fast Chinese food experience, eat here.

If you want to get some Starbucks before or after, this is a good place too.

If you're lonely, write more yelp reviews.

Please take some time out of your day to try some Chinese that's not poured out of a semi truck shipped from California(if not further)."}
{"text":"I have been to Totts probably around 12 times and it is definitely at the top of my list.  I definitely recommend their various noodle dishes especially the Singapore Noodles with Chicken and/or Shrimp-the only exception would be the Pad Thai-I have found those noodles to be mushy.   Great value for the money and I like the fact that they are consistent."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. The owner has expanded the menu over the years to include korean, thai etc. They have one of the better menus with a larger variety and the quality of the food is good. you an either order in and eat there or you can take it home. 
favorite dish is Spring Rolls and Orange Chicken ( spicy) 
Owner is always very nice and knows many of his regulars by name."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new tonight so we ordered takeout here. The girl who took the order over the phone was very helpful and nice. But unfortunately the food was SO BLAND, chicken teriyaki was pretty much grilled chicken tossed in the sauce, vegetable chow mein was decent, cheese puffs tasted like plain cream chz in a soft puff. Felt like it was over priced."}
{"text":"Tots never disappoints! I live about 18 miles away one way and I make the drive out here for their Sesame chicken, potstickers and cream cheese puffs. Customer service is always great. It's small but clean. The food is always fresh and very flavorful. It's by far my favorite Asian food in the east valley."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, and the food is amazing. Definitely one of my favorite lunch menus of all time....of all time! (haha kanye) But seriously, go to this restaurant and try the orange chicken (the best in town) and also the spicy kung pao chicken is delicioius."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new go-to-Chinese-Place and after i found Tott's, I will keep looking. I understand what they have been trying to do, open kitchen with insight - I applaud that. Price was competitive as well, I like it. But..

Where it falls is the quality of the food. I ordered 4 different things off the menu, way different - but in the end it was just sticky and quite tasteless. The chicken was rubbery, which sucked because 3 our of 4 items was chicken. The flavors was bland and consistency wise it was just not appealing. 

None of my party enjoyed it. Maybe some people like this place, but i am far from a fan. Too bad, because I really wanted to like it too."}
{"text":"Super fresh, high quality food and fantastic service. I love coming here on a Monday for lunch, because I always have enough left over for another lunch later in the week."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good but that wasn't my main issue. It was the unwelcoming feeling I experienced. I will not be returning. The owner was friendly with everyone in the restaurant except my boyfriend and I. He would go table to table and talk to people and greet new customers and would acknowledge them when they left. The only acknowledgement I was received was an uncomfortable feeling of him staring at me when I wasn't looking, I'm assuming due to my abundance of tattoos. I felt judged and will not recommend this place to my friends or will never return."}
{"text":"This is most certainly the worse Chinese I have had in AZ. I ordered a stir fry dish and it smothered in a very foul sauce, all the veggies ended up being super soggy. I would honestly describe this food as a really bad pei wei knock off. I personally do not care for Pei Wei, but it's the only thing that describes it well. If you want anything even remotely authentic go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out based on the many reviews. I seemed to have gone on a bad day or maybe they had a new cook.  The man behind the counter was very nice and helped us pick out something from the menu while we made up our mind.  They have a lot of options which would allow for any combination of asian food one can imagine or be in the mood for.  I ordered the Spicy Szechuan with Tofu which seemed to have  out too quickly is my estimation.  The vegetables were hardly warmed up  and suspended in a huge amount of viscous pink sauce that had no spice at all.  It was so dense and cooled so quickly the veggies were floating in it like jello.  I can;t say I would recommend this place or that I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yummmmm! Best Chow Mein ever!! I came here three days in a row and tried different things! Nothing was disappointing! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, I order the orange chicken and rice. I will definitely order from this restaurant again :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving Tott's an unabashed five stars. Honestly, this place has always been such a pleasant surprise. The food is consistently delicious - way better than you'd expect from a \"fast food\" Chinese establishment.

I've spent WAY too much time on the hunt for decent Chinese food during my time in AZ (about three years now), and have yet to find anything rivaling Tott's except for one place aaaaaaall the way up in Cave Creek.

That said, Tott's is about half the price of its closest competition and MUCH more conveniently located. They work fast, their service us always spot-on, and the food is always really really good (especially the Orange Chicken!).

I've never once eaten in, to be honest. I treat Tott's as my go-to take-out Chinese, even though I'm driving 20+ minutes to get there. (The fact that I'm driving so far for take-out Chinese should be pretty telling!)

If, like me, you're generally sad about the state of Chinese food in the state of AZ, give Tott's Asian Diner a try. I'm pretty certain you won't be disappointed. I never have been.

Thanks, Tott's, for being so awesome! See you again real soon!  :)"}
{"text":"If I was only judging on food I would give them 3 stars. 

But they are just really nice and charismatic people and they asked for feedback. I love when they want to improve.

I ordered the beef udon. I was warned it was salty. Man was it salty. Black bean sauce and oyster sauce... I would maybe say tone it down with some beef broth or utilize, dare I say, sugar to balance out the flavor. But the udon noodle texture was on point. Not too chewy, not overly starchy. 

Hubby had the Orange chicken. He loves orange chicken and fried rice together but the rice felt was not complimenting the chicken. 

The atmosphere. Clean and orderly no complaints. 

What would I change? Tenderizing beef too long. It's weird when you don't have to chew your meat."}
{"text":"Support local Arizona businesses such as Tott's! Great food at a very competitive price. Mr. Young is fabulous as he greets every customer. Better alternative to Pei Wei and Panda Express which are very \"corporate and not local\". I will definitely support Tott's again!"}
{"text":"I used to work right across the street from TOTT's. My friend loves it so we'd go there on my lunch breaks. While I am not a fan of getting Asian food often, I would agree to go to TOTT's. 

I was super sad when they moved- because the owners of this place are genuinely nice and want to make you happy. It's Pei-Wei style restaurant, where you get your own silverware and such, and the owner and even staff would walk around and take your plate if you were done and even refill my drink. Very friendly.

I get the orange chicken like so many other people- and it's delicious. My favorite part was me and my friend COULD share a meal because it's so much food. But we'd get our own, and then take home half for later. 

If they hadn't had moved, I'd visit more often, but will try and go every now and then. 

Overall, good service and food."}
{"text":"I'm so sad...out favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley has closed. :( We drove all the way from Goodyear to eat dinner and when we arrived we found Tott's closed with only a sign that said \"closed relocating\". We almost started crying as we dream about Tott's and look forward to making the trek across town for their terrific food.

I sure hope they open back up (maybe in Goodyear???). :)"}
{"text":"Take out shouldn't be that hard. But \"you always get screwed at the drive through\" applies here. Yeah I walked in to get it, but the result is the same. 

Order brown rice to go with the Szechuan dish - NOT in the bag. Really? It's part of the order - not in addition to - PART of the order. 

Want some soy sauce - NOT in the bag 

The Szechuan chicken - so-so and cold 

I'm home - not driving back 

Dine in I guess - so you can hold them accountable for what you've ordered."}
{"text":"Tott's put the icing on the cake for me. from the moment I opened the door the owner gave me a warm welcome. this was my first time there and he gave great recommendations. the orange chicken, vegetable tofu chow mein, and the walnut shrimp, all very very delicious. this is not the kind of place where a waiter/waitress waits on you and refills your drinks but the owner kept the perfect rate of conversation with me and my girlfriend, to where we felt very welcome but not awkward. he also brought us chop sticks and forks, and it is a self serve station. for being located in the middle of the arizona desert, this was some pretty damn good chinese food. overall, great customer service, great food and a great comfortable atmosphere, prices were affordable and very short wait for food! go here. i will be going back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Great Asian Diner. The owner was kind to my family and provided excellent service. The food is much better than other Asian diners in the area that I've tried--and large portions, too!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service and quick! We mainly order to go and we do not wait long. The orange chicken is our favorite and we try different items each time in addition to orange chicken, they have all been good. The only item that we don't care for is the giant pork roll, it has very little pork and stuffed with cabbage, we tried twice and both times we left it on our plates. The portions, food and price are great."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it was in
the location where The Habit is in now. 
Decent size food portions and always 
satisfying. I almost always notice people
from my place of employment here so this
isn't one of the lunch places where my 
lunch buddies can really come and safely
bitch about everything that goes on in our
little slice of paradise. I usually get the
curries - they're all good. And a bunch of
us back at the license plate factory all 
agree that the Orange Chicken here destroys
Panda Express' version like the fist of an
angry god pounding a demon back to hell 
through the earth's crust. Place can get
crowded during lunch - sometimes people have
to wait for tables before they can sit down.
Parking is always plentiful though since it's
in a big mall. I think they had more space at
the old location but what can ya do? Owner is
pretty cool guy and very entertaining. If you 
catch him during a rare occasion when he's mackin' 
be sure to take notes, son."}
{"text":"Perfect Chinese food all around! No complaints at all. Every time that I'm around the area from being out of town, I always contemplate this place. If I'm hungry and want Chinese food and I'm in the area, then there is no question that I'm choosing this place."}
{"text":"Ordered some takeout: lemon chicken, Mongolian beef, Kung pao chicken, and chicken pad Thai.

It was not as salty as the other \"fast food\" Chinese restaurants. The sauce was good. The portions were generous.

Overall, I would go back and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Tott's is one of my favorite places to eat.  I almost always get the sweet and pungent shrimp over brown rice, spicy and a side of edamame.
Man!.. I am good to go after that!"}
{"text":"Tried Tott's for the first time last night with my mom. We ordered over the phone and the guy taking our order was very friendly and polite. Picked up the food and it was waiting for us when we got there.

The crab puffs were a little heavy and greasy for our taste. The egg drop soup was delicious - lots of egg! The chow mein also had a lot of vegetables, which I loved! The orange chicken was okay; a little soggy. My mom liked the beef and broccoli, but didn't really have anything to say about it (pretty average). Portion sizes were great and I had my leftovers for lunch today. I would order from here again, especially for the mein!"}
{"text":"Thai Mix (red curry) I dont know what this is but it's not Thai.  Bland and not even similar to Thai red curry.  If you want Thai food hit Royal Thai Grill or Thai Rama.  I would have been better off going to Panda Express which makes me cry a little on the inside."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and the customer service is great. Good quality and very delicious food and the prices are not bad at all. I had the orange chicken just to be safe the first time and it was one of the best I've had so far. Had to get it the second time I came. This place earned the 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is the best Americanised Chinese food I have had this far. The staff here is great. Really just As all around."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and reasonably priced.  I had Bangkok chicken curry and my girlfriend had Dan Dan Noodles.  he he he  (Dan Dan is slang in Mandarin for something.)
Anyways the food was good but the one problem was the high oil content.  I had to visit the toilet 5min after leaving the restaurant.   My girlfriend who is a total FOB had to go also, so don't say that I'm not used to Asian food."}
{"text":"Tott's is our go to for Asian food.  The pork rolls are huge!  My wife is a huge fan of the wonton soup.  I can't think of anything bad we've had on the entree side- Spicy Island Chicken, Grilled Bourbon Chicken and Walnut Shrimp are all winners!  My wife likes the Create Your Own Stir-Fry.  Noodle dishes are very good as well.  Also, they are always very polite when we come in to pick it up."}
{"text":"The staff here is friendly and helpful with fantastic food. The portions are extremely filling and tasty. I am a huge fan of their Lo Mein, it is fantastic. Their fried pork egg rolls are huge and is a meal all by itself. The food comes quickly and inside it is very clean and tidy. Excellent tasting fried rice and their tofu is amazing. I am not a fan of tofu, but the way they cook it I will find myself ordering the Hot Korean or Spicy Szechuan with Tofu instead of chicken or beef. Well worth your time and money. The owner is usually there to greet you and asks how your meal was and how your day is going."}
{"text":"Really good asian food, served up fast. Order than sit down kinda place.  Everything I have tried there so far as been good. Spicy beef, Korean dishes, chow fun, orange chicken.....

Clean inside and feels modern, service is great as well. Good alternative to the panda option."}
{"text":"First time in.

Bought lunch. Ordered orange chicken with white rice. Probably safest order in the lifetime of humanity. It had good flavor. Filled me up.

I would probably come back."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the cream cheese puffs from here. They are so Yummy!  I also like their sweet and sour chicken.  I haven't tried to many of the other items but did like what I received from them."}
{"text":"We live right down the street from this restaurant and have been going there regularly for about 7 years now. The owner is so nice, and the staff is always efficient and friendly. Now the food....the food is just... outstanding! It is freshly made every time, spicy and never fails to satisfy. The pork rolls are enormous and a meal themselves, but the dragon noodles are my absolute favorite. The soups are great, the salad is fresh, what else is there to say? I have never had a bad meal there and have been there dozens of times. I will be sad if they ever go away, because no one does it like this."}
{"text":"Used to come here at least twice a week when I was living in Chandler. Employees are always friendly and every time I call in my order they know who I am. Some of the best orange chicken you can find in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. Asked for the Malaysian dried red curry. Excellent flavor and good amount of spice. Very flavorful."}
{"text":"I love Tott's, my bf and I go every other week or so to treat ourselves. They are fast, and they play great music (at least my taste in music). The chow mein is delicious, never greasy. My favorite dish is probably the salt and pepper crispy chicken, but everything is great there. Orange chicken is a classic. Always 5 stars."}
{"text":"Probably one of the more frustrating experiences I've with a restaurant. Long story short: I wanted crab puffs, didn't get crap puffs in delivery, called restaurant, they told me to call grubhub, called grubhub, and the grubhub guy couldn't find my order and failed; so no refund... maybe the staff was off its game, or what not, but all I wanted was crab puffs. So if you try to deliver from this place with your priority being crab puffs - be wary. Aaaaand to top it off, there was a hair in my food. Teaches me one lesson though, don't tip before you get your food."}
{"text":"So good!  Wish we had started eating here earlier.  Great service and orders are ready super quick.  Very clean inside."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Tott's since it was at the Guadalupe and McKlintock location. It is the first choice whenever we are thinking Asain food. The owner takes pride in his business and the food that comes out of the kitchen everyday. He runs a flawlessly clean restaurant. I receive the highest quality service and it's nothing but of a reflection of the management. The food is delicious and comes out fast! No matter if I'm dining in or taking my food out I will always choose Totts for food quality and service."}
{"text":"I am heartbroken to report that my first venture to Tott's (finally!) garnered me an incredibly bland pad Thai and burnt crab wontons! I can't believe - I won't!!
I've heard such great things about Tott's, it's RIGHT by my house and the manager that took our order was SOO nice, that I refuse to give them less than 3 stars, despite my pitiful meal. My BF ordered the tofu orange chicken and fried rice and said it was fantastic, so I have faith in you yet, Tott's. (The same BF did confirm that my pad thai was curiously sans flavor - how is that possible? It had all the correct ingredients, it's quite peculiar...)
So, we'll be back, Mr. Tott's...we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is fine.  It's been a few years since I have been here so I wanted to check it out again while in the area.    The pan fried noodles was good but a bit salty.   The fried rice was very bland and about par with most fast food fried rice.   Presentation and serving size was good.    No complaints, but nothing special either.    See you in another few years as it seems business is good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Arizona...fan for life.....fantastic orange chicken, very clean and the best owner ever (even if he is a Raiders fan)"}
{"text":"Absolutely shit, spring rolls taste like they were cooked in a plastic bag in the microwave, crab ragoon was tasteless, potstickers were hard as rock. Basically it was all frozen tasteless food that I will have the joy of dealing with the aftermath, and for the owner that decided to to tell me that it was my fault and then hung up on me in the middle of the conversation, only to have one of his employees speak on his behalf when I called back..... pathetic waste of life and space you are. To the employee that took the call thank you for being the adult over that child that you work for. Totts you get 1 star minus 4 stars you spineless snake."}
{"text":"With hands on the wheel and eyes on the road, it's amazing what you don't see!  Such is Tott's which I've passed hundreds of times not knowing it was there.

Tott's is  a very good neighborhood spot - not necessarily a Chinese food destination.  On the other hand, the menu doesn't stop there also offering: Curry, Thai, and Japanese.

Clean?  Extremely!  Best yet you can see your food prepared!
Fresh food?  Yes, definitely!
Friendly?  Very!  The owner himself takes your order and says \"thank you!\"
Good prices?  Yep.  $7 to $10 buys dinner.
Portions?  Dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow.
Seating?  Maybe, maybe not.  It's small restaurant and they do a very good business.  A few outside tables though.
Service?  Very fast!  Take out took less than 10 minutes.
Food?  Good!  Yet I always kick myself at home with menu in hand wishing I had ordered something else...
.......Guess I'll have to go back!"}
{"text":"I hate to give one star but I have to :/ had the stir fry crispy beef with fried rice. Omg! I wanted to die, no joke. The BEEF was so extremely fishy and the breading was like eating a pork rind. The fried rice was so bland, Panda is even better. I took one bite of each and just walked out (I paid the $15 of course). I never review and I hate saying bad things but my god...Ruined it for me and I won't be back. The reviews are good for the most part so I'm sure certain dishes are killer but I'm forever scarred."}
{"text":"Love Totts! We come here all the time when the family gets together. They're always so accommodating and helpful! Thanks"}
{"text":"This was my first trip here. How have I missed it all these years. The GM and staff were so friendly. The atmosphere is charming. But the food was some of the best I've had around these parts. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tott's always gives me outstanding customer service. They are polite and FAST! They also have great food. I go there for lunch at least twice a month. Nice people, good atmosphere, and great for order and pick up (they have always gotten my order right.) I would recommend Tott's to everyone!"}
{"text":"If you don't like Panda Express you won't like Tott's. Had dumpings, crispy beef and chicken dish. Dumplings were doughy, beef was in thick sweet sauce and served with big pile of white rice. Chicken was dry sauce was lighter but not very flavorful. Had fried rice with chicken and it was basically a few peas and carrots in soy sauce rice. 

The staff was friendly and helpful. I believe our food was prepared correctly according to thier recipes, it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, and reasonably priced.  Can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"Yum! This was my second visit to Totts Asian diner. If you haven't been to Totts you are really missing out! Last night I ordered mild curry with chicken and brown rice. This meal did not disappoint! Covered in a lovely mild curry sauce were Chinese green beans, onions, mushrooms, eggplant, and sweet peppers. This curry really is mild, it was barely warm, but so delicious! The atmosphere is happy and busy. Judging by the conversations in line many were regulars. I should mention you will not leave hungry. Each time I have eaten here I have tried to leave some food for left over, but there is never any left over. I dont know why but this place reminds me of a NYC diner. Young knows his customers and greets them like friends. You will want to lick the bowl at this restaurant, but please don't your mom would not approve!"}
{"text":"Tott's is awesome!

I remember going to Tott's back when it first opened on McClintock and Guadalupe years ago. I ate there on their second day of being opened and I have loved the place ever since. They had to move locations due in part to a Pei Wei opening up literally 100 yards away in the same shopping center. Besides location, nothing has changed with this wonderful place. 

The food is really great. I would say Tott's food is like Pei Wei's except it tastes better, they have larger serving sizes, and there is a lot more choices on the menu ;) The service at this place is excellent. If you appreciate a business where they make an effort to get to know you and remember your name you will love Tott's. 

Pros:
- Awesome service
- short wait times
- great food
- great selection
- large servings
- very competitive prices

Cons
- not much seating"}
{"text":"My absolute FAVORITE chinese restaurant everrrrr!!! Try the WALNUT SHRIMP or the VILLAGE RICE NOODLE! 

the staff is ultra friendly and the food is soooo delicious. it definitely kicks pei-wei's ass. 

:) tell Young that Alli sent ya!"}
{"text":"My first 3 star review. I usually only review a place that is exceptional or poor, but since the choices for good Chinese food are so scant in the valley, one has to make concessions.

I've been here twice, the first time being told by a couple of friends how good it was, but it was rather lacking. Same as Panda Express.

2nd time, much better. I asked for extra spicy and that's what I got, but the flavor wasn't compromised. Good job. Still, nothing great, but I would return since there really is nothing else around."}
{"text":"Tott's Asian Diner is definitely a must try!  The restaurant is clean, service is quick and courteous.  It is so much better than Pei Wei.  The Won Ton soup is delicious and includes huge shrimps!  The pork fries rice and pork egg rolls are exceptional!!  Just as close as you can get to Chinese food in NYC.  Young, the owner is so nice and is very welcoming!  De-lish!"}
{"text":"The tried and true test for Asian American restaurants like Tott's is the \"fried rice test.\"  It's simple; are there frozen peas and carrots used in the rice?  At Tott's there are.  As far as the rest of the food, I tried two recommended dishes and the egg rolls w/ the fried rice of course.  The egg rolls are big but greasy, the other two dishes where OK, nothing special and there were the recommended dishes.

For such a high ranking on Yelp I was surprised by the quality of the food.  
One last note and as others have said, the quantity of food was good."}
{"text":"Walk up counter Chinese restaurant.  Clean but small. 

Very loud inside.  Owner/manager was playing videos on phone and it overtook entire restaurant. 

Ordered Orange Chicken.  Was pretty good.  Rice was nice and fluffy.  

Wife ordered Stir-fry Crispy Beef.  Felt like eating an under cooked pork rind.  Very crispy. Decent flavor but texture was too much.  

Chow Mein Noodles were good. 

Pork Egg rolls were huge.  Waaaaaay too much cabbage.  Would recommend staying away from them as there was hardly any pork and the cabbage was very welty."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint! 

I usually go to Pei Wei whenever I'm feeling in the mood for some quasi-Chinese food, but I'm pretty sure this spot is going to take its place. My first time here, I ordered take out and low and behold, I was actually shocked at the portion size of my dish. I had fried rice filled to the brim of a Chinese to-go box and the Kung Pao shrimp was in an entirely separate container. They didn't skimp on the shrimp or the veggies. It tasted extremely fresh and was super flavorful. 

My second time around, I got the lunch size portion (which still lasted me two meals) of Mongolian shrimp. It was out of this world. Absolutely incredible. I definitely recommend this. 

What takes the cake for me, however, are the cheese puffs. They are absolutely INCREDIBLE and I would go back just for these alone. 

Love that they're local too! Definitely becoming one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"There are a few times I wish I could give more than 5 stars, and this is one of them.  I can't believe I waited so long to give Tott's a try.  Just a little background on my experience with Chinese food.  My mother was not a great cook and the only time we had anything even remotely resembling Chinese food was when she would crack open a can of that LaChoy Chow Mein.  It.  Was.  Awful.

I had to wait until I was in college to get some good Chinese food and a friend took me to Yen Ching's in Waterloo, IA and set me up with sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  Ever since then I've had a serious love affair with mongolian beef, and I'll get sweet and sour chicken if a restaurant does it up with the peppers, onions, and pineapple.  I've discovered over the years that very few places do that any more.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their pictures, I can see that Tott's does it correctly.

Right away I was greeted by the employees, and the dude who took my order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered my lunch to dine in, and then an order of pork lo mein to go, to take home for my husband.  

The restaurant isn't very big, but it's organized well and very clean.  My order of cheese puffs was so nice and light and the sweet & sour chicken was perfect.  I loved that the owner came around and introduced himself and when I told him I like how they prepared my lunch he said, \"Isn't that the way everyone does it?\"  Nope.  Absolutely not.  

The chicken was lightly breaded and fried and the flavors with the sweet & sour sauce and peppers, onions, and pineapple were delicious.  It tasted like they use a good quality sweet & sour sauce too.  Usually the sauces at most places are very syrupy and sugary, almost like someone did a Red Bull reduction, and I usually get heartburn after eating them.  Not in this case.  The sauce was nicely balanced and so far no heartburn.

With the cheese puffs, a fountain soda, the sweet & sour chicken, and the lo mein my total was $20.27 before tax & tip.  Excellent experience all around.  This is food and customer service as good as it gets for sure!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to dinner place. Great service and great food! Orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken is our order usually."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of Tott's. Have placed order for pickup the last few weekends and each time my order was ready in a quick 10 minutes. Location is clean, staff is friendly and food is awesome. My soup is always pipin' hot which I love and my favorites so far are the Walnut Shrimp and Lemon Chicken. Of course the standard Orange Chicken is there but it's fun to try new flavors at Tott's.

This location is located next to a Gamestop and drive-thru Starbucks in the Albertson's shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Get a contact # on your website and you should get on restaurant.com and participate with their gift card program. Getting more exposure = more business...plus I would live there if you participated in it."}
{"text":"Another bow down to the gods of Yelpdom! In search of GOOD local Chinese, I find the recos for Totts. Hallefreakinlujah! 

I called in my takeout order an hour ahead; the woman taking my order repeated it to me twice over the phone [always a good sign]...I show up at the appointed hour and BAM, there's my order[repeated back again, thank you], screaming hot. This was a first visit and as reported by other yelpers, the manager greeted me with a smile and affable chit chat about my 4 different chicken dishes! He made me feel like I was the only one there and he was happy to be of service. What, I ask you, could be bad about THAT?? 

We tried the Bangkok curry, orange chicken, bourbon chicken, sweet and sour chicken [mainstay for the kids] and the potsticker appy. Large portions all, I gotta say I loved the curry as I am a total curry suck-up; but all of the others were really good. Of the non curry, I'd say the Bourbon was my fave. Potstickers and sauce were deevine. Could have made a meal of just them and probably will on a return trip. 

Immaculately clean space with tables in and out, its my new go-to place for Chinese. Top notch service, four entrees, each with an accompanying rice container, potstickers and the harbingers of my future, fortune cookes, I walk away smiling, having spent $36 before tip."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Totts, and I was so impressed with the service at the counter. Honestly it was more inviting than most sit down experiences."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is great, and the atmosphere is clean and inviting.   The owner is usually there too personally greeting patrons. Its a small privately owned diner with a few outdoor tables.  It's fairly unassuming but a real gem if you're looking for good Chinese food.  I can't really give much commentary on the menu because I always get the shrimp with walnut sauce but that is pretty tasty!  The prices are incredibly reasonable, comparable to most Chinese take out but minus all the grease and MSG.  Highly recommended!

EDITED TO ADD: I'm sad but I'm reducing my rating due to subsequent visits.  I don't know if it's me or the restaurant but I've been here at least 4 times and each time the food was less than stellar.  I tried the Pad Thai, the Vegetarian Fried Rice, a curry dish and the Sweet & Sour Shrimp and each time, I could barely finish it.  On the other hand, my fiance loved what he ordered so again it could be me.  I kept it at 3 stars because the service is still great and the place is clean.  I don't know what happened with the food though. :-/"}
{"text":"I love this place. When I asked for spicy food they gave it and then watched to see my reaction. Well, I needed some water or coconut milk to tame the spice and asked for it. They happily obliged and we all laughed about it! The owner came to our table to see how we were doing and stayed to chat. 

The food is great. Such diversity and Asian styles to choose from! They take care of their customers and serve good food!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was great, very good curry!  My husband loved the spicy crispy beef.  Portions are large enough to share and the food comes out fast.  No complaints at all.  This place is worth a visit.  We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service! Food is made fresh and the restaurant is clean and inviting. We had the pineapple fried rice, orange chicken and pork egg rolls. Everything was very good and large portions."}
{"text":"I came to Tott's for lunch. They have an open kitchen area which can be fun if you like to watch the food being prepared, however I found it odd that while I saw food being prepared I didn't smell anything. I am used to walking by a restaurant and being tempted to enter because of the delicious smell of the food they being prepared there. I went to the counter and ordered the orange chicken they seem to be famous for. The total was $6.82 which seemed reasonable. I sat down and was quickly served in a matter of a few short minutes.  My dish was served on an oval shaped platter. The orange chicken was on one side and the other side was a large helping of white rice. The dish had large pieces of chicken sitting in a large pool of orange sauce. The orange sauce had many pieces of red pepper flakes and other spices I couldn't identify. There were five or six large red and black peppers to add some spice to the dish. The chicken was not over breaded like you might expect from places like Panda Express, but the sauce was overly sweet. The sauce seemed to have a thicker consistency to it like a syrup. The five or six large peppers were a welcomed relief from the sweetness of the dish but they ran out fast. The spices and pepper flakes in the sauce didn't translate into flavor on my tongue. Im usually a big fan of orange chicken but was very disappointed in it overall and would not order it again. The owner was there and seemed very friendly, thanking every customer as they left. I saw some other food being prepared as I left and I can tell they were making an honest effort to make good food here. I saw that they were roasting their own peanuts, for example, instead if just opening a package of ingredients and tossing it in the mix. Unfortunately, my experience today didn't equate to the dining experience I had hoped for. It was just way too sweet and lacking flavor."}
{"text":"Awesome orange chicken, I got the white meat, it was amazingly crunchy, spring rolls were out of this world! what an incredible meal!!! thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I honestly think I've never had anything better, a tad pricey but big enough to share! Great atmosphere and the staff was super friendly! I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service on top of that it is always very clean. You can't go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"Checked on Yelp to see ratings. It was a 4 star.  Checked front door and they have an A  rating from health department. Have living near this business for a number if years, but, never stopped. What a surprise.  I had the sweet and sour shrimp. There were 9-10 nice sized shrimp and the fried rice was very good. The wife had the Orange Chicken and fried rice. She was impressed with her meal just as I was with mine. They are local owned and not a chain.  Each meal is cooked to order and not sitting on a hot table. Staff was efficient and friendly. Overall this was a great stop for a great meal. Will be back."}
{"text":"I give this place a 2.5 tops! How is this establishment rated so high? I had Mongolian beef that was about as good as sweet rubber and the cream cheese wonton....... Sad sad sad excuse for a cream cheese wonton. Try somewhere else first."}
{"text":"Well here we go.   Simply love the Singapore curry noodles.   The dragon noodles are average. If your looking for a good price and good food I would say try it!! On another note the owner is personable and I like him!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good!!
My husband suggested this place for dinner last week. Our picky daughter however wasn't having it. I thought about eating eating here for a whole week and finally bribed my child with fortune cookies and went there for lunch today. 
I always order the same thing, pan fried noodles with shrimp (spicy). The vegetables and shrimp were cooked perfectly as usual. It is a lot of food, but it is hard not to eat the whole thing. My picky daughter actually enjoyed her chicken teriyaki with noodles. She ate most of it and of course finished with two fortune cookies.
The place has always been clean and the service friendly. I just wish they would bring all our meals out at the same time rather than one at a time."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and the wait time was about 10 minutes. When i went to pick it up I had to add a kids meal to my order and I waited maybe 5 more minutes for them to add that onto my take out order. Quick service and really great portions for the price. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I are gluten free diets, and even though we both love Asian food, it is generally hazardous for us.  Tott's has been one of our safe havens in this area.  The manager is very willing to accommodate our needs, such as cooking without soy sauce.  For those who are highly sensitive, there will be likely be cross-contamination, but we have been eating there for years and feel that we have been far safer here than with Pei Wei, who has a gf menu."}
{"text":"Owner pridefully runs this wonderful establishment!  
Fresh food, made to order in no time flat!
A+ in my book, they even offer student discounts!
If there is something not up to par just ask and they will fix it, (although I have NEVER had to."}
{"text":"Was back at TOTTS last night - and it never lets me down!!  Last night I had the Twins Pork which is always one of my favorite go-to items on the menu.  The owner, Young, is as friendly as they come. He will go above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience!"}
{"text":"I have stopped coming because the food is not that great, the chicken has an after-taste and I have had better food. If it were not for the friendly manager and some employees, I would have not been such a glutton for punishment. The red-haired cashier will ring up your order, and then go to the men's and women's restrooms to empty the trash, bringing it through the kitchen (how tasty)  and then prepare the rice and rest of the meals without washing her precious little hands. I am sure the health department will enjoy this review."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and our daughters.  It was good.  Not great but good.  

I had the mandarin tofu & veggies.  The tofu and veggies were good.  The mandarin sauce was very bland.  I had to add soy sauce to it.  I got it with white rice and after tasting my daughters chow mein I wish I had gotten that instead.  Yumm!

Kids meal is only $4 and even though they don't list Orange Chicken on it that is what they let her order.  She loved it and it wasn't spicy even though the menu indicates that it is."}
{"text":"I was looking for a local place to get Chinese food and thought I'd try this place. I was impressed. Frist we have the \"pork roll\" which is a giant pork eggroll cut into four pieces. Minus the mushrooms (okay, I'm picky) it was great! It went well with the orange dipping stuff. Then we had the pork fried rice and sesame chicken, both were amazing! I loved how well the pork was cooked. The sesame chicken was great, just what I was looking for. The lunch specials  were a great deal. we took two boxes home. I look forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"i like tott's.  they make good food and have a fairly interesting menu.  Its like Pei Wei, but with a couple more options :)  I especially like their off menu item, the fried salty chicken :)  very yum.  Some of their items might be a tad dry with not a lot of sauce, but if u ask for extra sauce for it, they will be happy to oblige u."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty veggies plus lean meat with sauce that is complex and freaking awesome.  

The food is amazing for Chinese, but the service will blow your mind.  The general manager came out to see how we liked our meal.  He even brought out a flower for my wife because mothers day was the next day.  

For fast casual Chinese food, this rocks."}
{"text":"My roommate and I found this place through Yelp while on a search for some new tofu takeout.

We were both really impressed.
The portions are huge, lots of veggies, and the flavors are authentically delicious.
The \"Just Broccoli\" has become my latest craving.

Also, on a side note, I love that there are actually Asians who work there.
If I want Asian food, there damn well better be Asians working or eating there.
I'm just saying..."}
{"text":"think pei-wei but more of it!  i'm reluctant to pay for \"fusion\" but i was pleasantly surprised at the bang for the buck plus it tasted pretty good.  i don't venture too far off the menu but i can recommend:

1) the pad thai (sp?)
2) bourbon chicken

and i don't recommend the walnut shrimp (unless you like eating a whole jar of  mayonaise dumped onto shrimp)  perhaps it would be wise to ask them to leave the mayo on the side and you can add as much or as little as your gut can handle.

the service is friendly and the place is as clean as the starbucks next door.

what's cool is that they offer brown rice and i don't recall them charging extra for requesting it (take note other nickel-and-dime you to death restaurants)!

although i have to make a note of a time when we were there a half hour before closing.  the kitchen crew was soaping up the exhaust hoods and everything else while customers were still coming in to eat.

luckily (?) we already had our food at our table but who knows, mebbe we were eating tilex chicken too!

i guess that's the cons of having an open kitchen...the customers get to see the good, the bad and the ugly."}
{"text":"amazing food and prepared fast ! the sampler box is amazing! definitely best asian dinner in the chandler/tempe area"}
{"text":"Sesame chicken with brown rice is awesome. Love the spring rolls, crab puffs, and lo mean are great too. Always fast and nice to last minute call in orders."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and price! If your looking for someplace where you can't go wrong with your selection, this is your choice."}
{"text":"I came back last Saturday and ordered myself the orange chicken to go before meeting up with some friends that night. As always, the food was fantastic and my buddies are planning to stop by for lunch after they picked a few pieces off my plate. I hope you appreciate my sacrifice!

Also, the fried rice has improved, so they've actually gotten better. Think I'll head there for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Big menu, first time here, went with Kung Pao Chicken.....EXTRA SPICY........nailed it.
Great little asian place, right down the street from my place of work........Totts, you have a new friend, I'll be back soon!!! Cant wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Love this local spot. I got the fried rice, sesame chicken, and pan fried noodles. Everything is so good it's best to bring some friends and share"}
{"text":"Great value, great options and good flavor and done quickly. 

Don't mistake this with other fast-ish Asian places this places unique and better.

Many of them items are available with tofu and veggies for `6.25-7.  Stir fry, noodles curry classics and more can be had.

I tried the Singapore noodles, thin noodles with yellow curry and tofu and veggies. The flavor of the curry powder was bright and clean. The garlic sambal this place has was a great compliment. 

I also tried the red curry, it was very rich and tick compared to other curries and full of deep flavors. 

Service was fast and there was some nice patio seating in addition to the inside. Great for lunch or a fast casual dinner."}
{"text":"Very good and simple Asian dishes...fast!

I love the open kitchen and food made to order concept...and fast!  I've had the Chicken Malaysian dry red curry and Panang yellow curry with fresh crispy veggies topped the brown rice.  They don't mess around with the spicing up their curries.  The Crispy Beef really hit the spot for my hubby.  My little cutie pie liked his sweet and sour shrimp with lo mein noodles KID MEAL ($5.25).  The prices are reasonable.  It is definitely much better than the chain that rhymes with May Day.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a bunch of times and really enjoy the food. The prices are good and the portions are huge. Staff is friendly and the food comes out quick. I'm partial to the orange chicken myself, which I think is one of the best for American-Chinese food."}

This is my husbands go to meal everything is fantastic you will not be disappointed. You can't go wrong with the Hong Kong Chicken as your healthy option with vegetables instead of rice I love it and the orange chicken is on point. Don't sleep on Tott's it's the business"}
{"text":"The food at Tott's is always great. Been there several times and have never been disappointed. Nice little restaurant, clean, friendly staff, variety of dishes to choose from the menu. Worth trying out."}
{"text":"I have been to Tott's many times and I have tried almost all the dishes on the menu. KungPao and Angel Hair soup on the menu are amazing. Great for college students."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese style restaurant where most dishes are meant to be shared, though I noticed most customers were not doing so. The portions are very large for one person but some items are complete with starch, protein and vegetables. Entrees included Thai and Japanese types in addition to American-Chinese  and Korean dishes.

I had the chicken with veggies with chow mein; the rest of the group also ordered individually, not knowing that the items should be shared. So some food had to be taken home.  My food was not drenched in the usual oyster or other American-Chinese popular sauces but tasted, maybe a bit too much, of the cooking oil it was sautéd in."}
{"text":"Really good food. Nice place to get a quick good order and for a good price. Another place just a few minutes from me that I will frequent"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Sunday and I was surprised by how many people were there. It's obviously a neighborhood favorite. The setting is very nice--contemporary and clean. We had the sampler platter (good) and the sweet and pungent chicken (very good and different). Would definitely go here again and recommend to those in the area.

Notes: There's a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Also, it's quick service, so you order at the counter and they bring your food out."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for a long time.  We love it.  Great food...quickly served.  Great place for a nice, quick meal."}
{"text":"Great food! I'm half way through the orange chicken and noodles as I type this. At the suggestion of the dude at the counter, I tried the noodles and im a big fan (though the veggies could stand to be cooked a taaaaad more). The orange chicken is phenomenal. The people who reviewed this saying it tastes like panda must be having the best panda in the country, cause this is miles above any panda I've tasted. All in all great place - awesome food, friendly service, and very generous portions. I'll totally be going back! You know that's saying something when Wang's delight and Yogi's Grill are less than a mile from this place!"}
{"text":"Totts, our go to take out Chinese and it's oh so dang good! We stumbled upon Totts on the Door Dash app when we moved back to Chandler. I am beyond scared to try small, shopping center, Chinese because I'm very sensitive to MSG and dairy. To my surprise this place was not only delicious but I did not get sick. We have ordered Totts about 10 times and every time it's always hot and delicious. Our go to order is Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken (it's seriously award winning!!). If you choose to go in and dine, the people that work there are so friendly. It's just a great family operated business. The pricing is amazing too, very fair and far less expensive than other \"faster food\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Best Asian food ever. We live in Mesa and still drive to Chandler to get this wonderful food. The owner and employees are always kind and Friendly. 
Love this place."}

{"text":"Horrible management. I used to love this place, but after going in and being gawked at by the cooks, I'm over it. One of the cooks even had the audacity to take a picture of me with his phone. I complained to the owner of the restaurant (who is frequently there) and all he said was that the cook wasn't taking pictures but just texting. Excuseme? I'm pretty sure I know the difference between someone texting and someone laughing, pointing and taking pictures. And why would you allow your cooks to use their phones while working? Ew. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I would say this is a well deserved 4 star.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and the food was very good.  We ordered the pork egg rolls, mushroom stir fry with shrimp, shrimp fried rice, and the chow fun.  The food was delicious overall.  The chow fun wasn't as good as hoped but maybe the drive home affected the noodles.  Either way, really liked the place and will be back."}
{"text":"Good food. Clean environment. I had the chicken panang curry with brown rice. Quantity was good for 2 people. Right spice level for me and tasted just right."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we won't be back... Mostly because it was DISGUSTING.

I honestly can't understand why there are good reviews.

The customer service was bad. We ordered and paid online for takeout. When we arrived, the older Asian man there, (instead of greeting us or welcoming us to our first time in or something) scolded us for ordering via GrubHub. He said we need to call and not order online. He said GrubHub is only for delivery.

I imagine he's upset bc he pays a percentage to GrubHub. Unfortunately, in 2018, people like ordering online. If you don't want to allow online ordering for other than delivery, perhaps you can talk to GrubHub or another company about getting that for you. Uber Eats maybe? I dunno...but don't scold customers for spending money at your business. Maybe you could give a discount to people who call to order takeout or something. That might motivate them to do that. 

Biggest issue was that the food was gross. I bought $50 worth of food. About 90% went in the trash. We all agreed that it wasn't worth keeping. What a waste of money!

It was all dry... As if it was old or had been  frozen for too long or something. The flavor was bad. The texture was worse. The cream cheese in the rangoons was sweet...like cheesecake sweet.    The pork in the fried rice was chewy. The wings tasted like floor cleaning solution and a ridiculous amount of salt. The spring rolls were filled with a mush of vegetables. 

I'm very unhappy that I spent my hard earned money at this place. I will absolutely never be back.

I guess the good news here is that I won't be inconveniencing that guy with my online takeout order."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and got the most americanized dish (orange chicken) but it was great. Chicken was cut in larger portions which I enjoy and the rice was very tasty. Definitely will be coming back. Their lunch deal for 2 is a good deal"}
{"text":"Hongkong shrimp medium spicy was probably my favorite chinese meal I have had in a very long time. I like this place. Everything is clean and the food is very fresh.  Even the diet coke was tasty. They just do things right. A real gem.  Counter service but the food comes out fast. Always very hot. Try this place you will be happy you did"}
{"text":"I love this place. The menu is understandable, familiar, but still unique. The food is always delicious. The owner seems to always be on site and it's very welcoming."}
{"text":"They are on the Banned List. Sorry Tots, I wanted to like you.
First time had the Sheczuan Chicken. It had sugar syrup sauce like orange chicken sauce with added chili flakes. Nasty and missing something. Fried rice was bland and old. 

Second trip had the chicken lomein, again missing flavor and tasted old. Noticed 2 employees eating lunch and they had Pizza from another restaurant?

There are way better choices around that area, no need to go back."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant and very very healthy. The owner is very friendly and can customize the dishes however you want. My wife and I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never written a Yelp review here, as it is one of my favorite restaurants! If you are looking for large portions, great quality, great customer service, at a reasonable price, this is the place! I have been devouring Tott's amazingly delicious food for over 10 years; even at the previous location. One thing you will notice, is the longevity of the staff. Most of staff have worked at Tott's for years. Who wouldn't with a boss like Young! Although I have tried most of the dishes, a few of my favorites are the Pad Thai, sweet and sour chicken, (all white meat)!and Kung Pao chicken.  I like to change the Kung Pao a bit (add and delete veggies) and they never have a problem with this request. I almost forgot, the fried rice is one of the best that I have had. Perfect blend of rice, veggies, cooked to melt in your mouth! This is the ONLY Asian restaurant I will consistently return to, year after year. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am ashamed.

I have not been eating here when I have easy access to it. I remember when I finally went in there this past Saturday, that I had stopped by this place when I first moved to Arizona and really wanted a smoothie-but I think all their smoothies had dairy so I just left. A really nice warm environment-still totally a quick lunch place, but I still felt comfortable coming here at night-and judging from the full tables of ASU hipsters feeding each other tofu on dates, so did they.

I mean, the staff knows what is in all their dishes and I asked for the Tofu Yellow Curry with no fish sauce added in with rice which came within ten minutes and it was so good. Not very complex, but there were plenty of vegetables in it for once (not the usual onion and sad little pepper swimming in curry) perfectly sauteed and the rice was so good I kept eating it by itself instead of pouring the coconut in it.

I also really liked grabbing the fortune cookies before we sat down and we opened them up while waiting for the food, and like naughty children got to get another one when leaving. I had a huge take-out container and I kept thinking about that huge white container sitting in my breakroom fridge. If I was a cartoon character, it would be a series of panels doing a variety of activities while a big fluffy thought balloon of Tott's yellow curry."}
{"text":"Good food!! I always get the chow mein noodles (lo mein) or the pork rolls. The owner is often the one taking your order at the register, great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great food, good value.  Wonton soup is awesome and a meal in itself. I also recommend the Panang."}
{"text":"Tot's is awesome! I actually like it more than Pei Wei (which I like a lot). I just don't go as often since I don't live in Tempe anymore. But anyways, everything I have had here has been awesome. The sesame chicken, the orange chicken are amazing. I seriously don't think they have a bad item on the menu. Young is the guy that runs the place and is super nice. It is always super packed at night time. This is one of the best kept secrets in Tempe as far as I'm concerned. I hope they open up another store someday."}
{"text":"This spot offers a range of dishes from Kung Pao to Pad Thai. In my experience, places that seek to incorporate dishes from all of Asia on their menu tend to be doing too much at an average ability. I opted for the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodles with Chicken. 

Portion Size? Plentiful.

Price? Inexpensive, slightly more than chains (e.g. Panda Express).

Taste? The chicken was overwhelmingly dry and the vegetables were bland. The seasonings and noodles were average.

Of course, there may be dishes on the menu that they do a better job with but that would involve making a lucky pick. With so many Asian options in Chandler that specialize in a particular cuisine (strictly Thai or strictly Chinese) it makes it hard to justify a return visit."}
{"text":"Delicious, hearty servings. Lunch specials 10:30-4:00 pm. No M.S.G, only fresh high quality ingredients are used.  Open kitchen so you can see your food being prepared.  Speedy service, carryout for lunch is a pretty short wait. I got the runs, to salty.  Maybe my body isn't use to fresh healthy food.  It could just be me but I hope everyone else doesn't have the experience I had.  I originally gave 5 stars and was reluctant to change it but I did get sick so I feel I should be honest. Hoping they got their sodium issues in order."}
{"text":"1st time here based on the reviews. Friendly atmosphere and the food was fresh and very tasty. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"As I sat waiting for my food at Tott's, I began taking stock of my fellow customers.  New rule:  unless you are a chemotherapy patient or you live in Alaska, wool ski caps are not cool.  They only serve to make you look like Fred Durst.  And trust me, no matter what dorky haircut you have under that cap, it is infinitely sexier than looking like that guy.  Luckily, my food arrived before I yanked the beanie off Marky-Mark's head.

Maybe all the thai food has just destroyed my taste buds so thoroughly that all inferior asian cuisines are rendered tasteless.  Or maybe Tott's just isn't all that good.  I had the orange chicken with brown rice.  A more accurate description might read, \"I had the carmelized sugar chicken.\"  It was so sweet that my stomach began to ache as I finished my 6th bite.  I had to leave my food unfinished.  Not because I was full but for fear of diabetes.

On the plus side, it's clean, fast, and the staff seem quite friendly."}
{"text":"Always fresh food and a clean environment. It is a great value and somewhere I continually visit. Stay away from the boring chain restaurants and enjoy something new."}
{"text":"If you go to Tott's enough times the GM will eventually know you by name. He's always there and lives on a cot located in the back room.

If you bring a date he'll know her by her name too and he'll have no qualms flirting with her. 

Still, shouldn't every Mom n' Pop restaurant in your neighborhood be like that? 

Tott's has more ambiance than your average Mom n' Pop place. I kind of see it as a small corporate place that just isn't named Pei Wei. After all, the restaurant is connected to Starbucks. 

Remember, this isn't a Chinese restaurant. It tries to cover the Asian gamut by offering some choices of Thai and Japanese food. You won't find sushi here, but you can get a big bowl of udon and there are a variety of thai curry sauces to choose from. 

I usually get take out from here but it's got an elegant little dining area and the outside patios with its metal tables really are quite nice when the weather allows. The dark wood tables and non-traditional flooring makes you feel like you're eating in a place fancier than you really are. 

Tott's has raised its prices more than once over the last few years though. Pei Wei moving into the same parking lot didn't help matters. 

Also, the workers who you see on the same regular basis are not nearly as friendly as the GM is. It's not that they're nasty, but you don't have to ask me my name on a take out order if I just paid with a credit card (with my name on it) or if I've been there (and seen you) multiple times that month. 

People I've taken there like his personal, friendly approach and enjoy the food. Tott's serves some non-traditional dishes though and it's not for everyone. 

Twins Pork has jalepenos and bacon. The Lo Mein has somewhat of a smoky flavor to it that I think blows YC's out of the water. Also, some of these dishes are spicier than people are used to at a Chinese restaurant. Other dishes are very thick and syrupy over meat (stir fried crispy beef). 

There are a number of items I really enjoy on the menu. I notice that portions differ though. My black plastic box on take out never seems to be all the way stuffed and lunch specials are made to be bigger than they are by giving you half a plate of rice. 

When prices go up and I feel I'm getting lesser portions I have an issue. 

I've also never heard of paying extra for friend rice with a lunch special until I started eating here. The brown rice, which is free, is good though. 

I don't eat here as often as I used to. It's tough to pay nearly $9 without a drink and not be completely filled up on a take out order. 

I find that some of the thai dishes tend to be very saucy and are more of a value. 

I give it 3.5 stars. A few years back I would have said 4.5, but it's just become less of a bang for your buck and in these recessionary times, that matters."}
{"text":"I was  in Chandler for an appointment and thought I'd take advantage of all the Asian restaurant options. 
After way to much deliberation I decided on Tott's.  It's close to a friends house and I'd been curious for s while. 

Pretty darn good! I haven't found many great Chinese restaurants since moving to AZ back in 2000 but I enjoyed this. Orange chicken with noodles and egg drop soup. Both where big portions and flavorful. 

Food is made too order and very fast. Love the smell of the wok cooking! 

Thanks for the ordering guidance"}
{"text":"Having moved to the area a couple months ago, my wife and i decided to check out one of the neighborhood eateries.  tonight we chose tott's.

we read some of the reviews here on yelp, and they could not be more accurate.  we both thoroughly enjoyed our respective dishes and took advantage of their 2 meals for $20 deal.  1 appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees and 1 desert for $20.  

the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and small but cozy.  there was a constant stream of people coming in for take-out.  

the appetizer was 3 nicely cooked spring rolls that weren't greasy and perfectly cooked inside.  they came with a sweet & sour dipping sauce that complemented the spring rolls nicely.  

my wife ordered the hong kong stir fry with chicken (sans the mushrooms) and i ordered the orange chicken (their most popular dish).  the portions are large...enough for 2 meals.  

the hong kong stir fry was delicious.  the chicken was white meat and cooked well and no 'strange parts' like you sometimes find in stir fry.  the veggies were big chunks and cooked just right...not soggy and not crisp.  the orange chicken was wonderful also.  it had a spicy kick that built as you ate more.  the sweetness from the citrus evened the spiciness out for the most part, combining for a tasty balance.  both came with large portions of rice.  

for dessert we ordered the almond cheesecake.  a perfect ending to our meal.  it was light and fluffy with a graham cracker crust that had almonds in the crust.  

tott's provided a great experience with great service and tasty food.   a local restaurant that we will definitely go to again."}
{"text":"Really good fresh Asian food.  Very generous portions for a great price. They will customize your order with no issue. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"How is this rated so high?!?!?

I phoned in an order for the orange chicken, extra spicy and the tofu curry, unfried.

The guy on the phone said their tofu is only fried.  OK, so this pretty much means they buy the tofu already fried and don't cut it up and fry it themselves... 

When I got home (3 miles away) the food was luke-warm.  The orange chicken appeared to have been prepared by dumping 1/4 cup of red pepper flakes into the sauce.  There's no veggies with the orange chicken, and it didn't taste any better than any other random Chinese place.  The steamed rice was dry and slightly hardened, another disappointment.  

My girlfriend had the tofu curry which was ok she said, nothing special.  

Inside the store it was all young people who seemed polite.  

Really, it was nothing to warrant even 2 stars in my opinion.  

Even the fortune cookie we received had broken English:

\"Like the river flow into the sea.  Something are meant to be.\""}
{"text":"I love this place! It has UNDOUBTEDLY the best orange chicken in town! Just a little more spicy, which I cannot have, and it adds that flavorful kick. The brown rice and cream cheese rangoons are to die for! We go there once a week!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 3 years now the food is always amazing they use top choice meats and fresh veggies even though I eat ALOT there I don't sick of it! The owner is always there and takes great care of his customers. You can tell he truly loves what he does!! Thank you Torts!"}
{"text":"great fresh food! huge egg roll! i would recommend this place to anyone! i get the kung pow and sweet sour chicken both are great!"}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service! I had the chicken pad thai and was excited that they asked if I wanted it spicy and offered levels of spice. Great portions and price for a local spot."}
{"text":"I missed out on Tott's when it was located on Guadalupe & McClintock but I'm glad to see it didn't move far. 

As fellow Yelpers have mentioned, a sure fire bet is the Orange Chicken. Much tastier than Panda Express and Pei Wei in my opnion. Comes with your choice of steamed or fried rice. Also, if you request it, they will make it spicier for you as everything is made to order. 

Another good choice would be the Sweet and Sour Chicken, not as crunchy as the Orange Chicken but just as much flavor. It also comes with plenty of veggies and pineapple chunks, something that is really hard to come by at a place like Panda Exp. 

I think what really makes this restaurant better than some of your other fast food Chinese type locations is their friendliness and service. Every order I have made whether it be take out or dine in has been correct and really quick. Even with young workers behind the register, they are on top of everything and pay attention to your order. The owner is usually on hand cooking or serving which gives it a local feel rather than a chain. 

Check it out if your in the area"}
{"text":"Great menu selection, food is hot and fresh and you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Ok Chinese food. Nothing that knocks your socks off. Pot stickers are decent. Fried rice is ok. Orange chicken is ok."}
{"text":"So - apparently the \"boss\"/owner is the kind of guy who likes to run up and lock the door on potential customers - right in our faces! - 15 minutes before they close. Evidently he doesn't care about my business. I doubt he cares about yours. 

Yep that's me standing outside your glass door right now, writing this negative review. Yep I took a picture of it too. So all of yelp can know of your terrible business practices. 

And yeah, when I told you you got a one star review, you flicked me off and told me, \"f*ck you!\"

Yelp - kick this horrible business and owner off. 

Don't believe me? Check the time stamp. Still not 9:30PM."}
{"text":"Before Christmas my son and his girl friend came up from Tucson for a visit and to exchange baked goodies.  She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.

I was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.

First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.

There are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! I jusy ate there and tthe rice was dry and the chicken was dry. I will NEVER spend money at this establishment again. Totally just gross!"}
{"text":"So I've had a few dishes here and I have to say, all 4 dishes I've had were super salty. Til the point where it's overwhelming and I can't take another bite. I've ordered Mongolian beef, salt and pepper shrimp, combo fried rice and something else I forgot but it was also salty. I liked the environment and the customer service and I kept saying that maybe I'm ordering the wrong dishes but 4 out of 4 of what I ordered were salty so I'll probably stop cuz it's really not that cheap."}
{"text":"The food is just average, the best orange chicken is not from Tott's Asian Diner but from Tokyo House where the sauce tingles on your tongue. Tingles! The service was friendly and the portion size was okay. I don't understand why everyone is slapping themselves silly over this place. I'll just chalk it up to crowd hysteria."}
{"text":"Tott's is a good local Chinese joint.  It's got cute decor, tasty food and reasonable prices... what more do you need?  

It's especially cool that they offer food 'your way'... which basically means your choice of meat, tofu or veggies in any noodle, rice, brown rice, fried rice combination.  It's good stuff.  

See ya there!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, we are here with good friends of ours. Food was very tasty and the place was very clean I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. The food was great & the GM Young was funny & very hospitable. My whole family enjoyed their meals; my girls loved food. My youngest daughter ate her whole meal!!! This was the first Chinese restaurant that we have eaten at since moving from Atlanta. The service was very quick too!"}
{"text":"i've gone back several times since my first review, and thanks to a helpful suggestion from brandon, i got the orange chicken with white meat only.  its delicious!  i've taken several friends here and they all enjoy the place as well.
if you're ever in the complex, skip pei wei and head to tott's!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the staff goes above and beyond to be friendly. They are a mom and pop type place that strive to provide high quality food with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Tried the stir fry crispy beef and the spicy island chicken. The beef reminds of Peking beef drenched in sweet spicy sauce. The chicken tastes horrible, dry and flavorless. I wouldn't even call this real Chinese food"}
{"text":"I went in today and got an order to go. I love this place! Friendly staff, and extremely fast!!! I hardly had time to decide what I wanted to drink, fill it and sit when they said my order was ready! The food is always delicious, veggies cooked just right, not soggy cause they're overdone or crunchy from being under cooked. I love this place! The Hong Kong with beef is my fave dish, and their portions always leave me with lunch for the next day:):) definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I used to go here infrequently when it was Pick up Stix.  I tried it last night with a big phone in order as AI had family.  They cheerfully said ready in 25 minutes and it was.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken as spicy as they could make it.  The owner rang us up and asked who ordered the extra spicy and make sure I had water.  He was right!  Most places are afraid to make it as spicy as I like it, but not TOTTS.. Thumbs up for that.  Everyone enjoyed what they ordered, even my picky 9-yr old who had the pan fried noodles with chicken.  The only minor complaint came from my brother in-law who said it was saucy.  Then he proceeded to eat the whole thing.  One thing keeping them from getting 5-stars is the tip jar at the counter.  I get tips at a service type meal, but not to give me my food and take my money.  Overall, it was great and we'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"Today I decided I have to give Tott's another chance.  The boy adores this place so it is clearly going to be in my regular rotation.  Tonight I ordered the Bangkok Red Curry with chicken.  It was pretty amazing.  It had mushrooms, green beans, green and red bell peppers and tofu in a curry sauce.  The sauce was not too heavy, but enough to coat the rice a bit.  

The best part, however was that I called it in to go.  I asked for my curry to be very spicy and the GM (referenced in my earlier review) made me promise that I had enough water at home.  Cute and hilarious.

So, Tott's, I guess I can't be irritated when the boy says he wants Tott's.  Yum, Bangkok."}
{"text":"This place is addicting.  I stop by once a week just to get a fix.   It's not your typical Asian place you see in plazas.  Try this and you won't regret it 


Recommend.  Kung pao chicken"}
{"text":"Another in a line of fast casual restaurants, Tott's is locally owned and operated.  

Their food was good.  Started with pork lettuce wraps which were fair.  Continued into Dragon Noodles, which were quite spicy, but the flavors were not melded well, and the wide rice noodles absorbed the moisture quickly.

The orange chicken was good.  The Kung Pao Beef was very good.  The Walnut Shrimp was probably a little too sweet for my taste.  Steamed rice was fresh, fluffy, sticky but not too sticky.

Overall a fair restaurant, and if you're in the mood for fast casual Chinese in that area, I would definitely choose there rather than the other fast Chinese restaurants that are right around there, and choose Tott's over Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Always consistently good. Restaurant is always spotlessly clean. Their spicy chicken & apetizers always hits the spot. Only down sides are limited soup options & no delivery. The place is right next door to gamestop too so I can kill two birds with one stone."}
{"text":"Friends asked us to dinner to this place a little later in the evening. We walked in at 9:27pm on a Friday night and confirmed before entering they were open until 10pm. As we approached the counter a man who looked like the owner or manager asked if we were ordering to go or for dine in. We said dine in and he quickly replied that we only had 20 minutes. What?!?! That was your first response. No \"welcome to Totts, thank you for coming.\" Not only did we get the stern impression we were not welcome to stay, but we had 33 minutes before they closed, not 20. If they don't want to be there late then they should change their hours. We ordered and sat down. The good side was that we received our food quickly. Then as we were eating this manager just would stare at us from behind the counter. Clearly frustrated we were there. The food we pretty good which is why I am giving 2 stars, but what a horribly uninviting experience. As soon as we stood up from our chairs at 10:00 on the dot, they rushed over to take our food. This is a service industry, I wish this manager understood that."}
{"text":"Tott's use to be one of my favorite Chinese food restaurants, my co-workers and I would go at least once a week. I went there last night when the owner wasn't working and received the worst customer service I have received in a long time. They messed up my order multiple times and told me I was wrong when I clearly wasn't. They gave me an attitude when I was attempting to be polite and didn't listen to me. Worst of all this was a takeout order and I had to drive there twice and then deal with their rude employees. Even the cook gave me an attitude. I have never received less than perfect customer service when the owner was there, but I am sad to say that me and my co-workers will never return to Tott's again. Best of all, when I got home they did not give me any soy sauce, sweet & sour sauce or pot sticker's sauce which I had asked for extra of each one on both trips... And I had just given them 50 dollars of my business..."}
{"text":"Well, on a slow Sunday after Halloween morning, the lady and I were in dire need of something tasty to soak up the tricks that all the previous night's treats had left us with. We thought that PeiWei would do the trick, some kind of noodle something or other. Turning into the parking lot too early though had us passing this place, we yelped it and seeing its solid four stars after 40 reviews, we had to try. 

Tott's does not disappoint.  The menu is actually pretty similar to Pei Wei with one outstanding factor, the owner of this place came out and talked to us, him and his family own and run it.  They've been there for six years now he says (2 before Pei Wei).  Pretty messed up that the property owner would put a second Asian diner in there.  Pretty messed up that Pei Wei would try to exploit a mom and pop shop's built up following.

Tott's still thrives he says, and thrive they should.  Service, ingredients and preparation are outstanding here.  The menu spans several nationalities, from Chinese to Thai to Japanese.  Pretty basic stuff but great if you have a craving for any of those, and easy to suit many palates in one place.

Lady had the Hong Kong noodles.  Wide noodles with cabbage and bok choy.  Wonderful flavor here, kind of a grill taste.  My choice was Udon noodles with beef as well.  Noodles were very soft and the fermented beans that made the sauce for mine were very flavorful.  Neither dish was particularly spicy, but both had great flavor.  Definitely better than any fast Chinese I have had in the valley.

Great atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food for very cheap."}
{"text":"Sadly, I went to pick up my yummy food last Friday night and there was a sign inside saying they were CLOSING 12/20 due to the fact they had lost their lease!!! After drying my tears, I asked what happened and the server told me the landlord didn't renew the lease and instead is leasing to a 'burger joint' WHAT??? 
I am heart broken! I sincerely hope they decide to find another place in the area soon!! There are open spaces in the strip mall at Kyrene/Elliot (hint hint)"}
{"text":"If you're thinking...mmmm I'm craving Pei Wei, go here instead.  It's in the same plaza (this place was there first), you get larger portions, same price, but the food is just WAY better.  The owner is usually present, and is a great guy.  My favorite is the dandan noodles (blows Chang's version out of the water).  The sesame chicken is good, the appetizer sampler plate is more than enough food as well.  Honestly, I stopped going to Pei Wei after I found this place."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars but I was a little frustrated when I ordered food and they asked me about what kind of rice or chow mein etc. I wanted and didn't tell me that one of them was an increase in price.

The food is usually very good and the service is good

Chow mein is extra if they don't specify."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food place! The beef and broccoli is perfect! The employees are very nice and helpful. I go here so often that they know my order! Thanks Tott's!"}
{"text":"Really good. But sorry, definitely not Pei Wei. Can taste the deep friedness. Greasy. Less chicken than bread. No fresh veggies. Cheaper tho."}
{"text":"Food is great but I'm giving them a 1 star because I just spent 60 $ at this establishment with my wife and didn't bring her here so that the\" illegal\" cholo kitchen workers can disrespect her. This is suppose to be a family restaurant not a place where we can't even eat in comfort. First of all if you are illegally in this country and have a job then do your job. Don't blow kisses and wink at customers because that's just disrespectful. Its already disrespect enough you are in this country. Management seriously needs to Rethink their hiring process because I already phoned immigration for the illegal activity that's going on there. So unless you want the establishment to be shut down.  You should probably terminate those two cooks before they get there."}
{"text":"I revisited this place and my opinion improved a lot, so I took back my old review. The food arrived quickly and whatnot. It's a little pricy, but good. Try the hong kong pepper chicken. yum"}
{"text":"Wow this food is great!
They helped me order a Paleo meal here and were super quick to bring it out to me!
The spicy sweet chicken was amazing.
The staff is really friendly and helpful here. A great quick lunch stop."}
{"text":"Tott's has the best Orange Chicken in Arizona. They have friendly staff who always remember you, great prices, and amazing dishes. Dishes are served with brown rice and generous portions. Also try the Traditional Signapore Rice Noodle.

New location (Ray and McClintock) is a little smaller than the old location but has a nicer atmosphere.

 I like to think of Tott's as a better version of Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Tott's is open again! New address is 4030 W Ray Rd # 1
Chandler, AZ 85226."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch ordered the chicken cho fun . My friend has the island chicken and we tried the spring rolls. Best sweet and sour sauce I have ever had and we got our food within minutes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The owner and the staff are awesome. The friendly, outgoing owner is there everyday and the quality of the food is excellent. The food is always fast, fresh and delicious. You can't go wrong eating there."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Lunch portions are more than enough here. I had the orange chicken and noodles, very tasty ! The sample platter was delicous. Also had the giant pork egg rolls and they were mainly all cabbage and barely any pork. Won't be eating those again. The owner handles the cashier, cleans tables, and serves food at times. He treats his customers right and can be a funny guy. He definitely works hard for his money. I will be coming back here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Like that the meal is freshly cooked when I order it. Ingredients are fresh, the help always friendly & Owner has been present  many times when we have visited here, visits with customers - very personable. My favorite dish is the Hong Kong chicken with brown rice. Great fast food alternative. Very clean. Casual ambiance."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian restaurant in Tempe!  Also, my boyfriend Mr. Picky Eater likes it too!  They GET tofu.  They have tofu so good that even my non-vegetarian friends order it instead of meat which is fairly unusual.  Every time I try something different (the broccoli dish, the Mongolian, soba noodles... ) I have a new favorite!  The manager seems really cool and attentive.  He really seems to care and that is at least as delicious as the food."}
{"text":"Tott's is great- pan fried noodles (chicken), lettuce wraps, and the Orange Chicken, all excellent. 
 The restaurant is all new. You order at the counter. Everyone there is very friendly and helpful. Don't order the Lemon Tart-why did I?? 
If you want good Asian food, go here."}
{"text":"The Salt and Pepper chicken is so good. I can't bring myself to try anything else."}
{"text":"First 5 star review for me. I don't think many businesses deserve the 5 star rating because there is usually something that can be improved. Not here. Tott's is delicious, well priced, served fast and fresh.

I've had a wide range of their menu items from the Thai based dishes to the Chinese dishes. Everything is great. Definitely somewhere you should go."}
{"text":"Was told to go here and I did the other day for the first time... THE best Chinese food EVER!!! Make sure to get the pork eggrolls, I guarantee no other place makes them this great. I also got the orange chicken with chow mein and my husband got the broccoli stir fry.. Everything delicious!!!! This is the only Chinese food restaurant I will go to from now on.. Just wish they delivered :("}
{"text":"TOTT's aka \"Talk of the Town\" Asian Diner has reopened after a little hibernation forced by a silly landlord that couldn't see what he / she was losing!  The new address is 4030 W. Ray Road, Suite 1 , Chandler, AZ 85226.  It is on the northwest corner of Ray Road and McClintock...and alas, again...a Starbucks is down two doors from it.  Should I even mention the Gamestop neighbor?

All I can say is that the grand re-opening was standing room only and the food is just as delicious as we left it!  This location is a bit smaller I feel from a seating aspect, and I anticipate it will feel that way for a bit while the family gets into place and the locals discover this place so be prepared to wait a little.

But isn't no M.S.G, high quality veggies and meats, pure veggie oil only, well trimmed meats and poultry to keep the fat content low, and the general care and expertise in preparation worth the wait?  

I can only now celebrate the year of the rabbit! I'm a Tott's fan for life!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted non chain Chinese food in hopes of finding something with flavor. 

I saw the menu on the window and liked what I read. I went inside this place it is small but very clean. The tables were wiped down and shiny, there was dishes and condiments on each table.  I had the Salt and Pepper Crispy Chicken and asked if I can substitute the rice for steamed veggies. The gentleman said yes. My total was $8.00 and I took my order to go and waited for a few minutes until a gentleman walked over to hand me my bagged order which had soy sauce, napkin, fork, menu, and a fortune cookie. 

The taste was really good and spicy. I will return to try more of their dishes. I think it's say better than Panda Express flavor wise and less expensive than Pei Wei."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch. Similar in style to places like Pei Wei, but much better quality.

My favorite is the Chicken Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Great food, 1st try since we've moved into this area. I will be ordering again! P.s The pork.is cooked like I'm accustomed being from the Caribbean and all."}
{"text":"I love small businesses and especially if they treat people well.  Tott's is a family owned place and the owner is very nice.  I haven't eaten at this place since they moved from the Guadalupe/McClintock location to the Ray/McClintock location, but I'm sure it's still great.  

Hopefully the landlord is good with them and Tott's thrives here.  We'll come by some time.  I just recommended them to some people at church and they ate there today!

Great food, nice ambiance, good customer service.  The Chinese food, however, does cater more to the American taste rather than the Chinese, but that's okay."}
{"text":"get the sweet and pungent shrimp it is hands down the best menu item. my only regret is that there isn't another location for this business near Gilbert / Queen Creek where I live because I would eat there daily."}
{"text":"Hit or miss every time. Last time sampler plate all over cooked, tough and crab puffs burned. Never again."}
{"text":"New location. Same great food!  My kids love eating here. More Authentic than Pei Wei. Recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for great Asian food, Tott's will satisfy that craving! 

Dude and his roommate used to live nearby, and this was one of their college staples. How I never went here before this year, the world will never know. 

Both times were take-out, never dined in. 

So far, we've tried . . . 

1) Orange Chicken 
2) Dan Dan Noodles with Beef
3) Kung Pao Chicken Stir Fry 

The Orange Chicken is great. Much better than Panda Express, but that's no surprise. However, for those saying this is Chandler's best Orange Chicken? Sorry kids, but that title is reserved for Tokyo House's Orange Chicken on Alma School and Warner. It will blow.your.mind! 

The Kung Pao Chicken Stir Fry could have been a little spicier. 

The Dan Dan Noodles are perfect! Tender beef, and just the right amount of spice in the garlic bean sauce. Always ask for some extra cucumber. 

In all, this place rocks! Tott's is now on our list of go-to Chandler Asian establishments."}
{"text":"Totts is a solid Chinese restaurant. It's clean, the food is flavorful and at a decent price. I always get either their Kung Pao or their Orange Chicken."}
{"text":"Finding good Chinese food in AZ is tough. (Pei Wei and Changs don't count folks). This place nails it. Super friendly service, great food, and reasonable prices. They also use quality ingredients, not the cat food stuff you'll get at your average gross cheap chinese fast food joint. The owner is almost always on-site and his staff are awesome. What are you waiting for? Get some Pork Rolls stat!"}
{"text":"Not a 5 star place just yet!!! But in time it'll be because I only went once and haven't tried everything! The food I ate was good to my taste! I order the Honey Walnut shrimp and it was perfect, not too much mayonnaise and crispy to the bite! So far the service I got was quick and friendly! Not too big of a restaurant! Perfect for the neighborhood! The place feels like a whole in the wall restaurant with good food. lol BUT its a modern and clean looking place!! The price is average for a meal around 10 bucks. A little high for quick Chinese take out, but worth it! I would say the restaurant without the host and waiters!! lol! I will be going back to try the other dishes and keep my review updated!"}
{"text":"After moving to Chandler I was on the hunt for a new Asian restaurant. I tried several Asian restaurants I saw on Yelp! but everyone was just ok until I found Tott's Asian Diner. I wanted to try Tott's at least five times before I left a Yelp! review. Tott's has become my new go to Asian Restaurant and confidently I can call it the BEST IN CHANDLER!

Tott's is most importantly very consistent and has outstanding customer service! Everytime I have ordered pick up from Tott's the food is FRESH, HOT, and very FLAVORFUL. The portions are respectable and prices fair. My favorite entrees are the Chicken Pad Thai, Hong Kong Beef, Orange Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Vegetable Lo Mein, and Pot Stickers."}
{"text":"This was so good and cant wait to come back best orange chicken ever with chow main noodles"}
{"text":"This is what all Chinese food establishments WANT to be.

Clean, affordable, fresh, delicious.

Big menu, can't go wrong.


Honestly my favorite Chinese restaurant of all time."}
{"text":"Tott's is a great middle of the week, weekend treat, sunday afternoon snack, type of place. The asian food is very fresh and you have your choice of curry, stir fry and noodle dishes. The portions are generous, the staff is courteous and the owner has always been on hand. I count Tott's among one of my neighborhood favorites."}
{"text":"Tofu was ehh so for this vegetarian that means only veggies and rice.  Tofu lettuce wraps were nothing to write about so I won't."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. Each time getting something different and each time I have been unimpressed. The orange chicken tastes nothing like orange chick it bland. The Pad tai was really bad, I couldn't even eat half. The only reason I have 2 stars was because they are quick and the people are very nice. But sorry to say this place is nothing special. :-/"}
{"text":"Love this place! Owner and employees are super friendly and they offer a wide selection of choices. Love that they offer brown rice."}
{"text":"Best Asian cuisine in Arizona! We stopped last night, my girlfriend, and I after my nieces graduation ceremony. They closed in 30 mins, so we respectfully got take out. The gentleman was beyond welcoming, and he was making us laugh so hard. I needed that. The prices, and portions were great! We got home, and the food was so fresh, and so flavorful! We can't wait to go back! Thank you, from Amber, and Sonsi!"}
{"text":"Tott's reminds me of my favorite Chinese eatery in Chicago: Friendship Restaurant.

Everything tastes fresh, and the boxed presentation of to-go foods is top notch.

My favorite menu item, for only $6.25, is the sampler plate. Three spring rolls, four pot stickers and four cheese puffs with dipping sauces come in a box on a bed of lettuce. Everything is perfectly cooked, with a touch of firmness on the pot stickers, cheese puffs with crunchy tips and soft bodies and spring rolls that taste like spring.

No MSG. Pure vegetable oil. Trimmed meats to reduce fat, and an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks.

Easily my favorite fast Chinese in Arizona."}
{"text":"Amazing as ever. Had crab puffs, spring rolls, orange chicken, sweet and pungent chicken,and my son had teriyaki chicken. He never finshes his food and he cleaned the plate. The portions are huge! Love it here"}
{"text":"Talk Of The Town - Asian Diner

They have my favorite Orange Chicken and I think that their service is always awesome.  So I'll give them the extra star because it seems great service these days is harder to find than great food - not to mention at a great little neighborhood location.

The owner always says hello and will make custom orders if asked.  It is one of my favorite lunch spots as the food is always made fresh, fast and friendly - which are my 3 keys for a great lunch.  I have also had great experiences when I have called ahead to pick up food.  I like to get the dinner size for lunch turn it into two meals."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out so I can't really speak to the dining experience. The person taking my order was polite and my order was ready quickly. It seemed clean inside the restaurant and everything was made correctly in my order. I just didn't really like the food. It wasn't bad but it had some unadvertised green bell peppers in it, which are one of my least favorite foods. They were easy to pick out but to me its a flavor that lingers on everything it touches and I just hate it. I probably won't go again since there are so many other options in the area that I know I like but I wouldn't recommend against it if someone asked who isn't quite so adverse to bell peppers."}
{"text":"From out of town on business, I was shopping for groceries and saw Tott's Asian Diner on the other side of the parking lot.  I looked it up on Yelp and saw the great ratings.  I tried the pepper chicken and was not disappointed.  I will try to make it back in the next couple of weeks to try the infamous orange chicken."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Tott's from friends, but last night was the first time we went. 

We were celebrating Chinese New Year and instead of going to Chopstick Express, we headed down to Tott's. My friend insisted I get the award-winning orange chicken, so we got 2 orders of that and the walnut shrimp. 

It's nice that they bring out the food to you, and I have to say it was really good. Like some have said, it wasn't swimming in sauce, and it went very well with the fried rice I had. I would definitely come back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time and really liked it! My boyfriend got the orange chicken, and I had the walnut shrimp. Both meals were very flavorful, cooked well, were great portions, and also reheated nicely the next day. For some reason I really liked their fortune cookies too. I know it sounds like an odd thing to mention but I did! I usually never eat them but their fortune cookies had a homemade taste to them! We will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"The Hong Kong Style Rice Noodles with beef dish ( gon chow ngau ho, fried wide rice noodles with beef) is the most authentic Hong Kong style dish I have found in the valley. Except Tott's improved on this dish by making it less greasy than it is traditionally made. It totally takes me back to NYC Chinatown and Flushing where I grew up eating this dish a few times a week. I wanted to call my mom while I was eating to tell her that I finally found an authentic and good Chinese dish in Phoenix but she was already in bed for the night. 

My fiancé had the Orange Chicken with fried rice and he enjoyed it. I tasted some and although Orange Chicken is a Chinese-American dish, I have to admit it was tasty nonetheless. I do a lot of Asian cooking since it is the cuisine of my culture and as far as I can tell that there are no questionable ingredients in the sauce, like weird thickeners, strange syrups, or MSG and whatnot. It tastes as homemade as you can get from a restaurant (not that any real Chinese person would make Orange Chicken at home).

The portions were huge. My fiancé eats like a horse, usually he polishes off his plate and the rest of mine, but this time he finished his dish and was too full to help me eat the rest of mine. I actually ended up taking home leftovers, that's how much food there was per order!  The quality of the ingredients was good, the chicken looks and tastes like chicken and the texture is of chicken.  Definitely a problem at other Asian dining establishments, but not an issue at this one.

The owner was on premises and he takes the time to talk with customers. He is willing to customize the dish to your liking. Feeling like 1/2 chicken AND1/2  beef? No problem. Extra spicy? Sure! No onions? Ok. I liked that.

I could not tell the ethnic background of the owner, but he does speak Cantonese like myself. So, this would go to say that perhaps the dishes that are not chiefly Chinese may not be to your expectation because they are not actually made by a true Korean/Thai, etc. and they may not be employing true Thai recipes or cooking techniques. I will give some of the Thai dishes a try at my next visit, but I have a feeling that the real standouts at this restaurant will be the Chinese dishes.

Place was clean and service was great. They have some really authentic dishes here, and now I feel like I don't need to bother going to those upscale fast food Asian chains anymore. They overcharge for the portion size that you actually get and the food isn't as authentic as they claim.

This place is a little far from my house but I'll definitely come back, I can't wait to try out other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"We placed an order at 9pm right before closing for takeout. The husband had the bourbon chicken and it was very tasty. I ordered the orange shrimp and received orange chicken by accident, but honestly I didn't even care because it was that good. Tender chicken and a well balanced sauce that wasn't overpowering with just enough spice. 

We also ordered the sampler plate, which was equally good, and fried rice. The fried rice doesn't taste NY style (says this native NYer) but still good nonetheless. 

The overall theme is simple, quality, well balanced flavors that don't overpower each other. You can taste each of the ingredients used in the dishes and there's a real harmony, which is a rarity. If your palate is used to cheap ingredients drowned in sauce to mask their quality and poor cooking technique, this isn't for you. Additionally, a single order is easily double the quantity that other restaurants offer. Definitely a winner for us."}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit, and the one great spot that we had for Chinese food (Stanley's) closed down two years ago. Needless to say, it's been a while since I've had good Chinese food.  Fast forward to yesterday when, while on a trip to the Phoenix-area, I decided to do an internet search for \"good chinese food\". After reading a few reviews, and checking out the menu,  I ended up inside of Tots, and I'm glad I did.
My food was prepared quickly, the restaurant was clean, with a nice vibe, and the staff was very polite. The cool, rockstar-looking guy at the counter even brought my food out to the car for me. 
Oh did I mention the food was excellent!  I had the Singapore rice noodles w/vegetables and everything was fresh and delish!
When in the area, I'd definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"After my final walk out of Quick Wok on Southern because it stinks, I decided to try TOTT. It was a really happy ending! Not the kind where you get sexual satisfaction, although eating good Asian food can be orgasmic, which is why they won't let me eat at the restaurant anymore, but the taste and morning after effects are always the key.

Good, healthy portions make it half the cost because it becomes two meals. Great place for a date or just sitting alone, moaning in pleasure, which is why they won't let me eat inside anymore.

Many delicious dishes and the gigunda pork egg rolls are huge and give me pleasure like no woman can, which is why no woman will let me eat in the restaurant anymore.

Plenty of parking and a coffee place next door, which oddly enough also won't let me stay inside anymore. I just sit in my car, facing towards the restaurant and eat my take out meal, moaning in delight and starring at female diners, while my van is a rockin'. Yes, I see you putting that egg roll into your mouth, lady. Oooooooh YES!

TMI? I can never tell."}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese restaurant I've tried in the valley. I've noticed the food is either hit or miss for me. I had the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice a few times and it was really good. The other night I got the orange chicken and it was terrible. They were burnt and just overall gross. I couldn't have more than 3 pieces. Maybe it depends on the time of day you visit."}
{"text":"Try the pan-fried noodles with beef or chicken-- it's my favorite of all their dishes. The husband can certainly vouch for the Sweet & Pungent chicken, and the customer service is very friendly and personal. I love that they are so busy nowadays during the lunch time-- it's well worth the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was sick and got wonton soup. It was good but I've had better. I'd like to try some other food here sometime."}
{"text":"Best Asian food around. Very reasonable prices.

It's more of a casual place... No alcohol, order at the counter. But the flavors and the prices are on point. Try it."}
{"text":"Went in 15 minutes before 10 on a Saturday got turned down saying they had already closed. Bummer because I wanted to see what the hype was about."}
{"text":"The worst food ever. Please don't waste your time going here. Was craving Singapore Noodles. Ordered take out. OMG! I think it was made by someone who never tasted noodles, never mind Singapore Noodles. It was tasteless. Just boiled rice Vermicelli.
Ordered a Thai Red Curry. Didn't even smell good. So you can imagine the taste. No lemongrass or nothing Thai about it. It tasted like a regular Curry with Curry powder. 
Dragon Noodle, tasted like wax.
Called the restaurant & told them about it immediately. They didn't seem to bother about it. Just said they will let the Chef know. 
We had to get Burgers & that was our dinner.
Before you start cooking food from another region you should first learn the taste. Taste it from other restaurants & then match it.
Definitely won't be going here ever again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Asian food this is not the place. Other than that, food was salty, but not inedible. It was mediocre at best. Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been a fan for many years. Try the twins pork and the sweet and sour shrimp with brown rice. Best meal ever!"}
{"text":"Very good! Great prices and portion sizes. Food tastes fresh and not greasy. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Convenient place to get a quick bite. It's open until 9:30 pm on weekdays.  I had the shrimp with orange sauce. The batter was a perfect crispiness the only problem was that the sauce was super sweet and was more like a syrupy glaze of orange flavored sweetness. I love that they have the option of brown rice. The food came out quickly and everyone who worked there seemed very pleasant. I'd go here for a quick convenient inexpensive bite to eat but not necessarily when I'm looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"Always great service and seriously the best orange chicken and orange shrimp I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food is good. Portions are good size and prices are reasonable.  Staff is friendly and service was prompt."}
{"text":"The place is super clean and the staff was very friendly. The wife and I shared excellent pan fried dumplings. I then had beef Pad Thai which was fantastic. The wife had Bourbon Chicken which she said was awesome. The portions were enough for both of us to have two meals."}
{"text":"I love how fresh the food is. The vegetables taste as though they were just picked. The sauce is flavorful and the kids menu is perfect."}
{"text":"Yeah!  Kickass Asian fast food!

No \"bobo plates\", no little sterno grill to burn your own food, no 70s \"Oriental\" restaurant ambiance.  This is the REAL THING.  Just knock your socks off, FRESH Asian cuisine to please many palates.  Want veggie?  There's LOTS of vegetarian options for you made to order and brought to your table fast.  Chinese?  Sure.  Japanese?  That too.  They even have pho and curry plates.  You'll get a satisfying mound of food for $10 including bottomless drink.  My only caveat: don't bother having a big conversation with the person you may be eating with--this place is LOUD.  That's okay--you'll have too much fun eating to want to talk that much.

Look, I'm from the SF Bay Area, where Asian joints abound.  This place would totally outdo a lot of the spots back home if it were in the Bay.  Best Asian spot so far that I've been to in the Valley.  If there's a better one, I have yet to find it.

Go.  Eat.  Stuff thyself."}
{"text":"This is a very nice cozy Asian place. They have different dishes from Hong Kong, Thai, Singapore, China etc. The food is prepared fresh and fast. My personal favorite is Chow Mein. My first time here I asked the Chow Mein to be made a little more spicier. Little did I realize that they use chilli flakes to make it. My tongue was literally on fire and I askee them if they could do something to make it less spicy. They made an entire new dish fresh. I have been a fan of this place ever since. The staff is friendly and so is the owner.

Portion sizes are typically good and your hunger pangs should be more than satisfied."}
{"text":"We happily live right next to this place and were lucky enough to find a delicious and cheap location to eat take-out. Just the other day I had an accident in the kitchen which ultimately led to burning myself and I could not finish my dish however, I had to be at work in the next 30 minutes. (Night shift) I was able to order and get my food within 10 minutes and be on my merry way! It was also nice when I got sick and still wanted food food, but the Wonton soup hit the spot and was light enough for my tummy to keep down. I do need to ask on certain dishes to have light amounts of sauce cause it can be overwhelming sometimes, but they are more than happy to put less sauce in if need be. My family and I are big fans of the orange chicken, salt&pepper crispy chicken, and the crispy noodle dish."}
{"text":"This was the second time that we have eaten at this restaurant. I've been looking forward to returning since our first visit because we all thought that the food and service was great. 

Unfortunately our experience tonight was less than satisfactory. 

When we arrived there was only one other table eating so I don't think that our experience had anything to do with it being a busy night. 

We ordered chicken lettuce wraps, sesame chicken, orange chicken and chow mien. The sauce for the sesame chicken was overly gelatinous and the chicken was over breaded and soggy.   I didn't taste any orange in the orange chicken in fact, if I had closed my eyes, I would not be able to tell which was orange chicken and which was sesame chicken.  All of the dishes were sweet and none of them had stand out flavors. I guess they use the same sauce in every dish?  The chicken lettuce wraps would have been the best item of the night IF totts provided enough lettuce cups in the order. Standard order serves 4 lettuce cups. We asked for more cups and were told that they charged 2.50 for 4 more lettuce cups. We're talking iceberg lettuce, come on. I always ask for extra lettuce cups whenever I order lettuce wraps and I've never been charged.  

My daughter found a bone in her chicken. When we were finished eating, my husband went up to the counter and told the woman who was up front about the bone. Her only response was \"Oh, okay.\"  He came back to the table and rethought what happened and Went back up to the counter to ask to speak with the manager. The cashier said the girl he just spoke to was the assistant manager.  The assistant manager asked if she could help him. My husband stated that he was surprised at the way she handled the bone issue. She told him that they receive all of their chicken prepped so it wasn't the fault of the restaurant. My husband said that all he really wanted was an apology and recognition that there shouldn't be bone fragments in their food. She did apologize at that point and did comp the one dish
Which was nice of her. 

We all agreed that the food and service did not meet our expectations.  Not sure if our first experience was lucky or if this was just a bad night. Unfortunately we probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just got the mandarin stir fry, so delicious and healthy too. This dish is gluten free. Please be aware, totts dishes that include soy sauce are not gluten free."}
{"text":"After a week long stay in Los Angeles and eating exceptionally great Chinese food I came home with a craving for more. Due to sparkling reviews of Tott's and the fact that it is located across the street from my home I decided to give them a try. 

I phoned in an order for stir fry Mongolian beef with brown rice.  The order was ready upon my arrival so there was no wait time. The guys at the counter were friendly so no complaints about customer service. 

However, I was somewhat disappointed in my Mongolian Beef as it was extremely sweet. It was full of tender slices of beef and lots of veggies but entirely too sweet for my taste buds.

I will definitely return and try other items suggested by fellow Yelper's but I will definitely stay away from the Mongolian unless I am craving dessert."}
{"text":"I had the mild curry and cheese puffs while my son had the Singapore street noodles.  The curry had a great flavor, but it had way too much chopped bell peppers in it.  I realize bell peppers are a cheap filler ingredient, but there was way too much.  The cheese puffs were fantastic.  I had a few bites of my son's Singapore noodles and it was far too spicy.  Even my son could only endure a few bites - good flavor though.  My husband had to finish off the rest of the noodles."}
{"text":"Went to Tott's for the first time this week. Following other Yelp suggestions I ordered the Orange Chicken. Flavorful dish, but needed a bit more 'heat' (I guess I can always add that to my dish). Appetizer was the Lettuce Wraps. Nice cool lettuce with flavorful chicken filling. 

One appetizer and one main course fed two easily and the bill was $18.  

I'll go back to check out other dishes."}
{"text":"So, I am not a fan of Chinese food in general. At least, your typical Americanized fast food fare. Tott's does not fall into that category...at all. Let me break it down by stars...

1st Star = It is NOT fast food crap. It is fresh, made in house, and tasty Asian fusion (influences that are Cantonese, Szechuan, Japanese, etc.)

2nd = They seem religious about cleaning up and having a very presentable atmosphere. While small, it is comfortable and inviting vs. the shit boxes your run of the mill take out comes from.

3rd = Friendly. My god were they all so friendly. The GM came by and talked with us for 10 minutes, the guy behind the counter was super nice and accommodating. They sincerely seem to care about their customers. 

4th = Portions are very generous. 2 entrees and and app and we took home leftovers

5 = Value vs quality. You will be hard pressed to find food this good and delicious for this kind of money. 

The pork rolls were amazing. 
The orange chicken is literally award winning.
I tried the walnut shrimp, just wasn't for me, but I can't ding them for my taste...it was expertly put together and the shrimp were friggin' huge! 

I'm sending the wife over there for lunch as we speak to grab the Salt and Pepper Crispy Shrimp...and some other goodies. 

Thanks Totts! Keep up the stellar work!"}
{"text":"This is located in the same area as Red Seven computers so when I came to pick up my laptop I has already made up my mind that I was going to have lunch here.  My friend Vicky T. had tried this out and I know she has good taste, she's my friend. 

It was pretty busy when I came in and I grabbed a menu as I waited in line.  It's the same premise as Pei Wei.  You order and they bring it to your table.  They guys in the kitchen were working fast and furious to get things out.  I wasn't sure what I wanted so the young women asked me a few questions and made some suggestions.  I went with chicken broccoli and brown rice.  It came to my table about 5 minutes later, piping hot and fresh.  It was delish!!!  The broccoli was cooked perfectly, still a bit crisp, and the chicken was so tender.  The sauce used was also very good, a nice combination of a liitle sweet and a little sour with a small bit of heat.  Ya, I know, but I'm a wimp when it comes to heat.  I devoured it all!  

I watched as a steady stream of people came in, most got their food to go. The price point is about on par with Pei Wei too. I spent $10 for my lunch and a drink that was refillable. This was quality food and fast! This is a great spot, a local business, and I loved it!  Support local and go try it!!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Come in and expect Chinese-American food, NOT traditional Chinese food.  They also have a smattering of curries and Japanese food.

I ordered a couple things for lunch.  Pork rolls, basically pork egg rolls.  These were just OK.  They are VERY big, so decent value.  But the filling is mostly cabbage with very little pork, in this case they use BBQ pork.  I appreciate that the vegetables still had crunch to them.

Also ordered salt and pepper chicken with a side of broccoli instead of rice or noodles.  The broccoli was well cooked and left crisp, nothing special.  The salt and pepper chicken maintained its crispy breading but lacked a little flavor otherwise.  They use dark meat, which I appreciate.  Kept it moist and had more flavor.

There are things to like.  They have a list of quality controls that they use which is nice.  None of the food felt greasy at all (a far cry from Panda Express), they say no MSG, and some other  health-related stuff.  All that is well and good, but none of the food excited me.  It was serviceable fast-casual Chinese-American food."}
{"text":"Passed by Tott's many times and finally decided to try it.  The menu has a good mix of various Asian fare, i.e. Chinese, Thai, Korean, etc.  There are a good number of spicy choices so I was happy.  We ordered wanton soup, Tom Yom soup, spicy stir fry with chicken and Singapore Noodles with chicken.  The wanton soup was loaded with veggies and shrimp (4) but tasted \"fishy\" to our son.  He only ate the wantons and a bit of the broth.  The Tom Yom soup was huge with tomatoes, tofu and shrimp.  It was very red in color which I'd never seen before.  The broth was somewhat thick, but very tasty with a good hot and sour zing.

The Singapore Noodles came very quickly as did the spicy stir fry.  Both were very generous portions, enough that we took some of each home. The noodles had just the right amount of curry flavor and the chicken was tender and tasty.  I'd ordered my stir fry extra spicy and I wasn't disappointed!

Overall we were very satisfied.  The price was very reasonable, food was good, staff attentive, and restaurant was clean.

My only criticisms are that the main courses came immediately after the soup so we had it all on the table at once and there was too much tofu in the Tom Yom soup."}
{"text":"I was surprised.  It had been a different Chinese place before.  I am cautious about fast Chinese food.  This place was clean and has good food.  The manager was 5stars.  When I told him I was new, he went through the menu.  Orange chicken great. Broccoli and beef great. Sometimes veggies can be over nuked, these  seemed fresh.  Noodles were a bit bland, but I will be back."}
{"text":"The Dan Dan noodles has a nice hint of spice. The noodles are cooked well and pairs very well with the sauce. The sauce for the crispy beef is balance very well between sweet and spicy. The beef has a nice crisp to it hints the name."}
{"text":"Good neo-Asian food and service

Stopped in when we were nearby, hungry, and saw Tott's has a great rating on Yelp!.  Nice restaurant with a good pace of customers and very pleasant staff.  Dessert options were a step above the norm at a small diner like this, which is useful when you have little ones like my wife and I.

Food is good, but not great to my tastes.  The Hot Korean is semi-spicy and would do better with bamboo versus the carrots and more chili pepper.  My wife had the Pepper Chicken (name?) and thought it was tasty enough, but some pieces were warm while others were cool.  Dumplings are not meaty and are more veggie... and the sauce is a sweet vinegar thing that doesn't give much appreciable flavor.  Our daughters thought the Terriyaki Chicken was too dry to finish.

Pumpkin Roll was yummy.  Almond Cookie Cheesecake was left half-eaten as my wife said it tasted more like orange mixed with cheesecake.  I took a bite and have to agree."}
{"text":"I was actually in the area. And I just decided to try this place out. Im really glad I did. I luv'd it. Good good food! Their egg drop soup is the best I ever had. Definitely found a new place to eat."}
{"text":"Best salted pepper chicken hands down! It's hard to find a place that has salted pepper chicken on the menu in AZ. This is it! I love love love the cripsy chicken and it goes perfect with fried rice or chow mein. Swtich it up once in a while and get Orange chicken, but salted pepper is my favorite here! DELISH!"}
{"text":"Tott's is not a place you would go out of your way to frequent if you didn't like or work in the area. If you do, however, live or work in the area, I would highly recommend checking it for a fast and decent Asian lunch or dinner. And, yes, I use the word Asian, not Chinese - even though the dishes on the menu are primarily Chinese (although even that word is used loosely), the owners' inclusion of select Thai and Japanese dishes makes the cuisine more Asian than Chinese. Sort of like the food at Pei Wei, which just happens to be in the same center, but cheaper, more flavorful, and served with a little more heart. 

I was in the area picking up some medicine at our vet, so I thought I'd stop in and try one of Tott's lunch specials. Parking was a little tight in that particular part of the center, but I lucked out and found a decent spot that someone was pulling out of. When I went inside, I was impressed by the clean and simple decor - the red/black loft-like ceiling and tile backsplash behind the register were especially nice touches. 

I was also impressed by how amicable and helpful the GM was. When I placed my order (the $5.99 lunch special of Spicy Szechuan with tofu and brown rice) and asked how spicy it would be on a scale of 1 to 5 (since the signature chili symbol on a Chinese menu doesn't usually mean much), he took the time to explain that it was prepared medium-spicy and that if I really wanted to experience the full savoriness of the dish, I would probably enjoy having it spicy. He even added in a comment about how he approved of my choice since \"spicy is good for the body\"! Even though he was super-busy during the \"lunch rush,\" I definitely appreciated his willingness to assist me in making my food the way I like it. 

I sat down and put my number card on the edge of the table, but I didn't have to wait long for my food. The GM came over with it just 3 or 4 minutes later. The portions of the tofu/veggies and rice were quite substantial, and I could see that the veggies were fresh by how crisp and colorful they were. I was also impressed by the flavor of the dish; while the sauce was definitely your run-of-the-mill Americanized brown gravy, the spiciness was definitely there and the tofu and veggies were cooked really well. When I was done eating, I felt satisfied but not too heavy. 

Tott's is a clean, friendly, and flavorful alternative to other fast-food Chinese joints or to Chinese restaurants offering lunch specials. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars for food, 4 stars for service.

For what it is, this place is a good find in the Az area. The staff are REALLY nice. I ordered a noodle dish and then at last minute wanted a curry dish. They swapped my order without charging me the extra difference. I've had better food before, but for where we are and the quality, it's not too bad. My other friends enjoyed the food and feasted on this meal. I think my favorite was the walnut shrimp. I'd pass on ordering the curry again."}
{"text":"First time dining here last night! Food was delicious  a lil pricey for basic but was worth it. Food was plenty and the egg drop soup yum! Small dining area but they get packed fast. Owner and team were very on point and super fast and nice. Definitely will be coming again to try other items 

Edit: came back again last night (12/5/16) and ordered new stuff! Everything was again perfect  definitely our new go to place"}
{"text":"Great, Simple, Friendly, Great service. Everything you want in a normal restaurant where you can order 'take out' with ease. I love the service. I ordered a Pad Thai extra spicy. Usually most places dont make it hot enough. The server asked me twice how i want it prepared, it was amazing and blazing. thank you I will come again next month when I get to eat pasta again..."}
{"text":"This is some of my favorite Chinese food ever. Even after moving away from the valley for a few years and returning, Totts is still what I remember. Fresh veggies. Amazing menu with lots of variety. Good prices. Friendly and fast service. Not to mention the food is delish!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since my wife and I darkened the door of Totts. The prior couple of times we visited, the food was greasy and unimpressive. 

Having a jones for Chinese today, we decided to give it another shot for lunch. To our surprise, the line was out the door! Good sign. 

We had the Hong Kong with noodles, and the orange chicken. Both very good, with large portions, and competitive prices. Service was fast and you could tell the people cared.

I'm glad we gave this place another try. Looking forward to having this back on the list of places we regularly visit."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but the service from the owner is terrible. The owner is rude, and tries to get you out as soon as possible. With asian food, you eat half, get full for 10 - 15 minutes, then eat the rest. The owner isn't having any of that. The manager is a nice kid though.

The orange chicken is bomb!

DO NOT GET THE CURRY, IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. We literally had to put our own curry powder in it to make it edible."}
{"text":"I tried this for the second time today, and all I can say is that I'm disappointed. I really want to like this place because it's close to home, the service is friendly and fast, and it looks clean and well run. But the amount of sugar used is just bizarre. Today I got Twins Pork and there is more syrupy sweet sugar than pork (and they were generous with the pork). Before that, I got the Spicy Szechuan chicken, it wasn't quite this sweet but close. Funny thing is, I purposely ordered the pork dish because I figured there was no way they could make it that sweet. My bf got the Hong Kong rice noodles -- those were not sweet and they were really good.

Maybe you just have to experiment and find the right dishes here, but it still seems like an strange variation to be so heavy handed with the sugar. The other ingredients seem better quality than lots of Asian fast-food places."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time and I'm not that impressed. The food was okay and I eat a lot of chinese food but I definitely prefer panda garden over in ahwatukee to this place. I did only try one thing so I will be back for sure but the salt and pepper shrimp didn't do it for me.. Shrimp was overly chewy like a well done steak and the dry rub spices weren't really there it was almost just like o was eating a plate of fried shrimp. Staff was very friendly however and this is just based off one time so I will be back and try something else"}
{"text":"Tott's is a must try if you like Asian food. 

This place has been here for about 5-years, and now has to compete with the Pei Wei that opened next door - and it if is any proof of how good the food is - they are still open.

Nice little spot with modern decor and good lighting. The portions are huge and tasty. The service brisk and friendly. Good value for your buck too."}
{"text":"When I read others reviews who compared Tott's to Pei Wei I was skeptical about what I might be getting. I was pleasantly surprised that Tott's doesn't even compare to Pei Wei. It is soo much better. The food was outstanding. I love Chinese food and after living in the valley for almost 16 years I've finally found my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not awesome.  Fast Chinese food. Yeah, they cook it in a wok in an open kitchen but it's no where near the 'best' Chinese food I've ever had. No wait staff, order at the counter and they bring the food out (NOT necessarily all together and defnitely NOT appetizers first then entree - bizarre).  My entree appeared, we waited, then my wifes entree, waited, then my soup, waited some more then finally the spring rolls - I don't get it, deliver the whole damn order at once!  Clean place, it was busy.  Fried rice was disappointing - make better fried rice at home (it was basically brown rice with a few random peas and carrots thrown in).  Soup was good.  Spring rolls were, well, like a spring roll should be - nothing special.  Twin pork was a bit disappointing, pork had a lot of fat on it.  Would I go back?  Maybe if I was in the area and wanted take out, but that's about it.

Went on a cold night, the restaurant was freezing, had to ask them to turn some heat on as all the customers were eating with their coats on.  Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"My manager ordered food from here the other day and it smelled amazing she had these giant egg rolls. I decided I had to try this place out. I ordered the two giant pork egg rolls which was about $6 after tax was extremely disappointed. There was literally no pork in the whole entire world I think at the very end there was a tiny little piece. It should be called the vegetable a girl because there's no meat."}
{"text":"So much better than Pei Wei right next door. I am a big fan of this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Tott's is some of the best Chinese food in the area. It's insanely affordable, large portions, and NOT the hole-in-the-wall, mom & pop, lighted-pictures-of-the-menu-on-wall-against-a-floral-backdrop style place you've read about in Fortune Cookie Chronicles. (Which is a fantastic read if you like Chinese food & history.)

Instead, it's clean and modern inside, and Young, the insanely nice owner or brother-in-law of owner, is always very kind and generous and funny, to boot.

Now, the food. You'll need to check the menu before you order to make sure they have everything you're used to. While most Chinese restaurants all pick from the same playcard, Tott's bills itself as an \"asian diner\" and so standbys like moo shu pork are absent. To flesh things out, they add a handful of curries and some other pan-asian dishes you wouldn't normally see. (In the same vein, delivery service is also absent!)

Now that that's out of the way, ignore everything I just said and order the orange chicken. It is the best I have EVER had. (I make sure to order it \"not crispy\" since the shards-of-chicken approach is UNpleasant to me, which they abide by perfectly.) When it comes out fresh and uncrispy, there is no greater. It is just a bit spicy and has some red chile-type things in the sauce, so be prepared, or ask them to tone it down, but it comes out fresh, and hot, and amazing. 

Their chow mein is also fantastic. It's chow mein as it should be: soft noodles, not dry at all, and with tons of vegetables. I have them throw in shrimp, and they always include a big portion of just-right cooked shrimp.

I usually tap things out with an order of their great crab/cheese puffs. They're a bit light on the \"crab\" side, and might be \"krab\", but the flavor is amazing and their sweet and sour sauce is fantastic. Some of my favorite cheese puffs, pretty much ever.

If you dare order the pork rolls, a word of warning: they are an entire meal in and of themselves. They are the about as thick as your arm and there are two of them, served with sweet & sour mixed with spicy mustard. They are so big that they have to rubber band the foam container.

The portions are huge for dinner, and at about $11 each, you EASILY have two meals out of them.

Take the time to hit up this place for a different take on great chinese food. And if you ask Young for the orange chicken, not crispy, don't be surprised if he thinks you're me. (That's usually how he recognizes me!)"}
{"text":"Totts is my go to place if it's getting late and dinner isn't in the works yet.  I like that it's sit down but quick service. Food is GOOD."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place, great food, great portion sizes, and great lunch specials.  It's close to work, so this may be trouble!"}
{"text":"Main points:
-Similar to Pei Wei, food from different Asian regions 
-Order/pay at front & \"family style\" portions - easy for groups 
-Focus on the food rather than ambiance

Review:
I was originally drawn to this restaurant because of the variety of food they offer.  I was able to order Singapore Curry, Dragon Noodles (most like Thai), Malaysian Curry, and Spicy Island Chicken all under the same roof and they were all uniquely flavored and tasty.  At many places when a dish has a little red chili next to it indicating spice, it isn't really spicy but these dishes definitely had a kick to them, yum.  

The reason I give this place 4 stars is because the venue itself doesn't have much appeal although it is clean, and the food was a bit on the salty side.  However, the large portions, great variety, and overall tasty food make this place a great choice for your next group get together."}
{"text":"Great curry and the tofu is everyone else says.  The Tom Yum soup is spicy and all the portions were large
Come hungry and enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking everywhere for good Chinese food and finally found it! The food was great (Mongolian beef, cheese puffs, pot stickers, spicy island chicken, and fried rice). We live in Maricopa but would be happy to make the drive back to have awesome food, kind employees and a clean establishment. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai with tofu. Good spices but there was only FOUR PIECES OF TOFU. Basically it was just noodles. :("}
{"text":"I have been going to Tott's since my college days - it used to be on McClintock and Guad.

Faves: walut shrimp, pork rolls, orange peel shrimp. Young owns and manages this place and I have noticed that this somoe of his staff has been with him for years. That says something. The place is always clean and the staff is very friendly. Quick counter service and I always get at least 2 meals from my takeout order. They do the share a meal deal with app, two entrees and dessert for dine in only and that was a tasty good deal as well. I'm a total regular and very proud of it. It's nice to support a great, local business. Check out Tott's!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The menu is suprisingly deep and diverse, the quality of the ingredients and preparation are top notch, and the resulting flavors are delicious.  You order at the counter, and they bring your your meals.  You fill your own drinks.

All the \"Stir Fry Your Way\"s are delicious.  I haven't made it to their curries yet, but I'm expecting greatness here too.  But one real standout is their Orange Shrimp.   It might not be the healthiest thing on the menu, and of course it tends to the sweet side, but it's hand-battered, and let me tell you, the breading is out of this world.  I don't know what they do to make it so rich and light at the same time, but the magic works.

This is not a large place and I sometimes wonder if I'm going to have a place to sit, but it's never failed me or my family yet.  The proprietor seems to always be there and I think his son runs the counter much of the time.  They're both wonderful hosts and they seem to have set a tone of friendliness and helpfulness with the rest of the staff.   It's a really nice, but no-frills atmosphere with really excellent food.  You owe yourself a visit."}
{"text":"The family and I have been going to tots for years! Back when they were on Guadalupe and McClintock. The stir fry is probably my favorite type of meal there. They have baby corn in the veggie mix and the tofu is always delicious. The owner is always there working just as hard as the employees, taking orders and greeting customers. It makes it more welcoming and we always return again and again."}
{"text":"These guys are so great. The food is awesome and the service is always excellent. Try the Malaysian curry!"}
{"text":"For Chinese take out, definitely a great option. Large menu and friendly staff. Great lunch specials. Excellent place to go to or order from if you have a limited time frame, and want semi-Americanized Chinese food."}
{"text":"After a long day of sight seeing the boyfriend needed caffeine. Our GPS failed us on the exactly location of the Starbucks but it ended up being a good thing. I spotted the green logo and we hauled over three lanes and ended up here.. I needed cash... he needed a latte and between there we needed dinner....I spotted Tott's and laughed at the name \"Asian Diner\" ...... until I saw the red sticker of approval.....

We saw the Yelp Sticker and figured it was fate.... 
Tons of pan-Asian -fusion options.... suh-weet.

Spicy spicy me likey! 

This place has a kick which I love... I got the veggie panang with brown rice (call me a hippie). Tons of veggies, spicy curry and all was cooked perfectly. Snap peas, eggplant, large chunks of bell peppers, asparagus all mixed with some tofu. I greatly appreciate the fact there is an equal ratio of veggies... usually Asian spots will give you five million chucks of onions and not leave much else. 

The boyfriend got the crispy beef... it was a lil tough but the crispy and sweetness was a good combo with the spicy curry.   


Bathrooms are clean, 10% discount for students with valid (current) ID and the food is a good deal for what you get.... If you ever want to expand to California come to SANTA CRUZ!!!! I will be the first in line."}
{"text":"Below average food.  Dan dan noodle was very disappointing.  It was supposed to have bean sauce (which is one of the main ingredient) but was brown garlic sauce used in many stir fries.  I ordered it with pork.  Most places use grounded pork...but got sweet diced Chinese bbq pork.  You can tell the pork was old by the taste and hardness.  It was an interesting combo...sweet, spicy, and salty.  The potstickers didn't have any texture or flavor.  The best part was the skin and how little amount of filling used.  It reminded me of frozen ones bought from the store but not as good.  The menu said chicken potstickers...guess it could be or mashed anything."}
{"text":"Great price, good location, quick service. The food is just what I expected. No surprises. I LOVE that! Pictures on the menu are also nice so there is no doubt what you're ordering."}
{"text":"Oh how I miss this place! 

Best chicken lo mein around. Never had a bad dish! 

Same owner as when I lived in the area 10+ years. Same great service, same incredible food. 

Don't ever change Totts, you're top notch!"}
{"text":"Wow the best singapore street noodles I had in a while....reminds me when I was in Singapore. Shrimp not too bad...cant expect too much but I am sure better shrimp can be attained. The noodles had the right amount of curry flavor....so getting this again.

They look to have lots of options....well more trips back here....I think the real test is bringing my food critique gf to taste it....we shall find out."}
{"text":"I love Tott's!!! It really is good food. It always has consistent flavor and food is always hot and made correctly and good! When I want Chinese food that is the place we always go. I always order the same dish, Salted Peppered Chicken! It's great for the price too! Go get some dinner!!"}
{"text":"I went here today with my supervisor and it was very good! This place was packed...like standing room only. When a table opened shortly before we got our food it was a sweet victory. This place was much better than pei wei for sure. I ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken and it was very tasty.The sauce was all garlicky and delicious and it had a lot of veggies (broccoli, snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, etc), which is a big plus. The noodles were just ok, but what can you expect from a fast place, plus it's awesome that they offer this crispy noodle option to begin with!  My supervisor got the lemon chicken and was excited that they offer brown rice. Overall, it was good and I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"For a casual Chinese eatery, this gets a five star rating!!  Freshly prepared food that was delicious in a comfortable environment with excellent service.  

So much better than any Chinese food we've had since moving here from Seattle 8 years ago.  We ordered the Mongolian Beef, Crispy Fried Beef, the Combo Japanese Udon, and the Pork Roll.  Everything was fabulous.  Great flavor, texture, and large portions.  

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and always judge a Thai restaurant on their curry, usually green or panang. I ordered the Singapore green curry and pad Thai to try this spot out. 

The green curry consistency was thick and gelatinous, which I do not like. There was not much liquid in the dish like usual green curry. It was also very spicy and they did not ask my spice level preference so I assume it is pre-made. I also found a dark eyelash in my bowl while I was eating it. Not what I want to see in my dinner!

The pad Thai noodles were rubbery and it was just 'okay'. A little dry. 

I got take out on my way home from work. Although the price was good ($17ish for the 2 dishes), I will not be returning here. The search continues to find the best Thai food that I can pick up on my route home from work!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had a wonderful dinner experience here.  The dishes were well prepared and well presented.  The food came out quickly but it's not fast food. My only slight frustration was with no eye contact from several employees walking by to serve others when i was trying to get a to go container.  Very nice place."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley! I have been going here for the past 5+ years and still never a disappointment! All the employees are very friendly (also know me by name and order) and the food is GREAT!!! I am always referring my co-workers and friends to eat here.

They are re-opening in their new location tomorrow and I can not be happier! I will most definitely stay a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend here yesterday. I wanted to go somewhere besides Pei Wei for a change. Yelp reviews looked solid. The place was clean, not too crowded and the greeting was friendly. Seems they do a lot of take out but there are a good number of tables. Items are cooked to order with maybe the exception of a few things, for example the fried rice. My biggest issue was flavor. We both had a stir fry dish. Mine was the szechuan chicken and my friend had the mushroom w/veggies. The dinner portion was large but half of it was rice. Everything just lacked flavors...we hit the soy and chili sauces pretty hard to kick it up. We also had to get some plum sauce. I guess we'll keep looking for a non chain chinese restaurant..."}
{"text":"My family LOVES Tott's!  Its clean, fresh and honest food.  Never disappoints."}
{"text":"I went to lunch at Tott's today after a long, boring, staff meeting.  My friend had said that this place was pretty decent.

I'm usually very reluctant to try Chinese restaurant based on the reviews of my very Americanized Asian friends but eh, why not?

While I did get a student discount, my meal came out to be around $14 for cheese puffs, walnut shrimp, and brown rice.  I suppose it's a pretty standard price but here's what it breaks down to:

- Standard cheese puffs with very little cream cheese.  The scallions were a nice touch though.
- An incredibly small portion of waaay overly-battered shrimp with plain mayonnaise based sauce.

All in all, I wouldn't come back again!"}
{"text":"Maybe no one reads the reviews since they see four stars and hundreds but I was expecting something better for 10 bucks ish a dish at a fast food take out kinda joint. Order some pretty generic Asian dishes and didnt get what I expected. I wasnt worried about getting sick or starving because it wasnt edible but everything was just blah. Staff was courteous place was clean but I dont plan on going back. The tom yum soup was very tomatoey and no flavor. The meat dish just had huge chunks of eggplant and curry paste. Nothing really flowed together."}
{"text":"First time here, the food was ridiculously amazing, the customer service was above and beyond and the open kitchen was entertaining! Huge portions so I have dinner for later! We're for sure coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight with family (9 of us) and they were very accommodating and friendly. You order from the counter and they bring you the food. I can't even begin to tell you how awesome the staff is. Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, funny and every single one of them were fantastic. The 2 guys at the counter helped my parents maneuver an unfamiliar menu, brought out our food in a timely fashion, joked with us and we just had fun. The owner came by and thanked us for coming in and chatted it up with us, telling my sister to find a husband etc...very sweet man. Ok...the food. We tried the crab puffs which we all agreed were the best we'd had, the wonton and egg drop soup came out so hot and had more than a few peas in it like most other places, the walnut shrimp was beautiful and creamy, the Mongolian beef was a favorite and the mushroom stir fry was chock full of veggies. We also did the teriyaki chicken, sauce was a little sweet but ok because it came on the side anyways. I had the lemon chicken which was a bit flavorless for me and came with broccoli, chow mein noodles, brown, white or fried rice ( your choice). The portions were huge and we took a ton home. Also, the lettuce wraps were amazing and the prices were fair for the amount of food you get.This is now our new spot and if you try it, it'll be yours too."}
{"text":"What a great find. The food is first rate and plentiful. We tried green curry and bourbon chicken. Both were fresh tasty and colorful. The staff is helpful and polite."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is rated so high. 
As a test, go to Panda Express and this place, order the orange chicken and have someone taste them both. You will see that there isn't a difference in the taste. 
I expected more from this place but the food is just your basic frozen food cooked in a wok...or microwave. I will say that my wife the lemon chicken and it tasted like it was cooked, left out, and then reheated, you know it had that \"reheated\" taste. 
Unless the reheated taste is just the taste of the food and in that case it's just bad.

The service I guess was nice. 4 people on staff at the time, all were standing around talking. One guy was standing in front of the register playing jewel craft and he didn't acknowledge I was there. A girl took my order after shooing the guy away so she could enter my order in the register.

We also got pot stickers and they tasted like chemicals found in cleaning solution. My only guess for this was that they were sprayed on accident when someone was cleaning but it ruined them. They were also still raw and very under cooked. One was still cold in the middle.

If you want really good Chinese food, I suggest going to China Palace instead.
They are always nice and helpful. I like their orange, sesame, and lemon chicken and it has a nice crispy taste to it, not soggy like Tott's.

Overall, if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you."}
{"text":"I tend not to like fusion restaurants and stick to Chinese restaurants serving authentic chinese food, Thai restaurants serving traditional thai dishes, etc.  However i decided to put that aside and try this place solely with the perspective of whether or not they server good tasting food.  I have to admit, i was very satisfied and it changed my whole way of thinking about fusion restaurants.  I ordered the Singapore noodles with shrimp/chicken xtra spicy.  It was SPICY and loved it.  Usually when i order xtra spicy, it does not even make me sweat but theirs did :)  It was very flavorful and not greasy at all.  My only complaint was it needed more vegetables to balance out with the amount of noodles which is enough for plenty of leftovers.  My wife and kids ordered the Orange chicken which is another one of my querks as to me is not authentic chinese and is under the same category as General Tso.  Again i put my peeves aside and focused on whether or not it just tasted good.  I have to admit, i think i ate more of it than my Singapore noodles.  This place taught me a lesson in my food snobbery which i need to change and follow the words of Andrew Zimmern:  \"If it taste good....eat it\".  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes like the crispy beef and their curry dishes."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went back here after a long absence and I was surprised to see the menu had changed quite a bit. I always felt like they were trying to copy Pei Wei but now they offer some different choices. I picked one that sounded good and to my surprise the person taking my order informed me that the sauce was a bit bland and in a round about way suggested that I order something else. I said I liked spicy so he suggested the Kung Pao chicken. This ended up being pretty bland and flavorless so I can't image how bad the other dish would have been.

At the time we went (around 8pm on a Thursday) it was pretty dirty and service was not that great. I do believe that their food is somewhat healthier than some other places so if I was in the mood for some fast food Chinese then I would return. However, I really don't get why some Yelpers seem to think this place is all that."}
{"text":"This is a great Asian food diner.  We came for lunch.  I had the Hong Kong chicken per staff recommendation.   It has a savory pepper sauce and an array of veggies.   I had it will chicken and it was very good.  

Lunch for $7.  Kids meals for $4 to $6.  

We will be returning.

{"text":"i don't understand the hype. it's very typical american chinese food. tried the bourbon chicken and it was nothing special - tasted very teriyaki."}
{"text":"Interesting place, a little on the small side. Somewhere close to a Pei Wei with better pricing but definitely two steps above a Panda Express. 

We ate here for a friend's birthday and the food was decent. I had a Thai Curry rice bowl with pineapple and chicken. It was spicy, but not too much, and had good flavor. My only complaint is that there was barely any pineapples in it. Definitely needed more pineapples and chicken. Otherwise, decent, would eat here again."}
