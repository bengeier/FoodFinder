{"text":"Food was microwaved, naan was not fresh. Tasted OK, definitely average. The decor and ambience is awful."}
{"text":"I really wish there was a way to give 3.5 stars - really, this place does deserve an extra pat on the back.

This place has an excellent cook - the food is tasty: spicy without being on-fire hot.

However, the ambience sucks. The food is kept either cold or at room temperature and they heat it in a microwave when you order. Wait staff is minimal - basically, just the server behind the counter, who comes out and lays out your food once it's heated.

Gotta say, despite the unassuming decor, the food is always tasty, and the naan is some of the best in town.

One time (and one time only), I ordered take-out chicken biryani and discovered to my dismay when I got back to work that it had a distinct \"off\" odour. I've not had this problem with any of the other foods in the display - I suspect it's because biryani does not get ordered much - most people get one of the \"combo\" meals.

One more caveat: I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone on a diet - the food is on the greasy side."}
{"text":"Great value, delicious food. I had the butter chicken and it was exactly the way I hoped it would be."}
{"text":"Don't judge me ladies and gentlemen, but I apart from my complimentary meal on Air India last summer, I have never had Indian food until today!

I am not a huge fan of spice and generally get suspicious of any food that has the distinct look of baby vomit! 

ANYWAYS, I was super hungry after work and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Chicken Tikka with Naan and a pop; the whole thing came to $11 which I found a bit pricey but not too bad. Everything was delicious!"}
