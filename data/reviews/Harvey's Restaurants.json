{"text":"Terrible!!!! KEEP AWAY
had to return my soggy fries and the \"gravy\" was just basically flavoured water. Not thick or even close to normal gravy. Pathetic service too."}
{"text":"Harveys is amazing!!!

I've been going there ever since i was a little girl! 
The veggie burger is amazing, so are the onion rings. Poutines a so so but man i LOVE the veggie burgers!!! Also you get to choose what you want on your burgers/hot dogs. They make it right infront of you! now THATS service!
It can be a little long of a wait sometimes but i've never been disapointed!"}
{"text":"do not eat here . horrible verbally abusive owner . every time i went to this location the owner gives his poor young staff grief for pleasing customer with no shame in front of customers. My boyfriend has seen this with his other staff also and wanted to jump over the counter.  that nasty old power hungry man yells at his poor staff for picking through pickles so as we asked to get fresh ones . he then proceeded to yell at her for making a mess of the dried up pickles.  i have seen him do this at least 5 times. finally when i stuck up for the staff he was rude i demanded my money back. the poor girl looked like she was going to be in tears.  he tried to force her to pay for it out of her pocket. she is just trying to make a living working hard at a fast food joint for minimum wage. she treated us so well. the staff looked afraid to speak up . abusive abusive abusive boss. power hungry . do not support. he then told me and my mother to go f$@# ourselves . poor staff . they are in home depot. go to nandos instead they are always sunshine and rainbow and just down the street.  this harveys is like a sweatshop and labour board should shut him down or at least monitor. i'm not exaggerating . i couldn't sit there quiet any more . to the girl working behind the counter. find me . i have a great job opportunity for you where you will be respected. spread the word i'm not done with this.  how disgusting . don't eat here."}
{"text":"First time having the veggie burger at Harvey's, and it did not disappoint. Was not trying to be meat, but also wasn't just a patty of vegetables just mashed together. Was decently busy, but still went quickly. Anyway, it was really really good. Tasted super fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The fries are the best in the city, probably becasue this Harvey's is attached to a Swiss Chalet so they're extra yummy and chickeny.  The chicken burger is always freshly made, juicy, and not charred or dry.  Unlimited free drink refills!  The service is excellent across the board, and I feel that (except for one bald-ish male manager), they are genuinely sincere and happy to serve.  It's always busy, and there is never a wait.  The tables are as clean as they can be, considering the huge amount of customers.  (Always a large number of sexy blue and white collar male customers to ogle too...teehee!)"}
{"text":"Food always fresh and hot off the grill
Employees are usually happy to see customers, polite and friendly
Tables usually clean as well as washroom
Never experienced it being smokey yet
Sometimes burger can be extra juicy and leaks through the paper wrapping, but that's fine with me!"}
{"text":"First time at Harveys and we plan on returning! They have a changing table im the washroom and it's family friendly.  Good onion rings!"}
{"text":"One of the best chains I have ever eaten at, but by my rating, this is showing how I hate fast food. It must have been 3 in the afternoon and we just wanted a quick bite, so why not get some fast food? Harvey's has angus burgers, which was really cool. Their burgers have a weird taste, but they are weird in a good way. Unusual, better word. You also get to craft your burger yourself, from a small selection. The angus burgers, for what they were, we're quite good. The poutine was also quite good. Successful chain restaurant, located on busy Peel street."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff, but can get crowded fairly fast leading to a bit of a wait to order"}
{"text":"The burger was good, but the fries wasnt that good. You can see the guys making the burger from the small window it seems everything is good inside."}
{"text":"Best Harvey's I've found.  They are quick and make a good, topping filled burger.  The restaurant is never smoky and is usually clean.  Even during the recent renovation, they kept the dining area clean.  That takes a good crew, which makes sense because I'm pretty sure this team has been together without changing for the last five years.  I come every week and the workers are friendly every time.  
If you bring a group, everyone could walk out with a different burger. 

Only cons: They do not have the frozen drinks that the Harvey's in Newmarket has.   They got rid of the corn and black bean topping mix I liked, but I suppose if it wasn't popular that may have been too expensive to keep."}
{"text":"I always love Harvey's food, but this one is extremely smoky between 4 and 6pm when I'm coming home from work.  I think they need something to pull the smoke out.  The Harvey's in Aurora does not have this problem, so it is possible to fix it."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I have given this location the benefit of the doubt on more than one occasion. Don't expect a fresh hot burger from this location. I realize Harvey's is a form of fast food but for the price I expect my burger to be fresh and hot, not cooked 20 minutes before I get there and then warmed up after I order for the time it takes to toast the bun and cook some fries."}
{"text":"Wow, this was my go to Harvey's but the quality has gone downhill. Cara should check the quality of there restaurants when they give someone a franchise. Horrible food which includes salty fries and a poor excuse for a milkshake. I guess if I paid another $1.99 I might have gotten the other half of the shake. I only gave it 1 star and that is for the wonderful cashier that works there."}
{"text":"I have spoken to both the franchise owner and the GM of the area for Cara Food regarding my visit. Neither provided a satisfactory response. 

I was waiting in line to order when I seen the cashier step away from the cash, walk over to the garbage, pick up the dirty trays and bring them back to the cash and continue taking orders. 

These trays were not cleaned, wiped or anything. There was a tray liner placed on the dirty trays and given right back out to the new customers. 

I asked to speak to the manager and actually got the franchise owner. I explained how disgusting that was. She agreed and offered to replace my food. I asked what about the 5 people before me and the 3 people behind me that also got dirty trays? She said that she doesn't know who they are. I said you could go by the number on the receipt and/or the time in the orders. Just walk around and deal with, it's food safety, it's worth it. She liked and said that the numbers on the receipt are random and the time can't help her find the people.... Obviously lies.  

I told her how important food safety is. She of course didn't think so. She wasn't willing to risk losing money. Even though she knew it was wrong. All she needed to do was fix the issue right there.... And this is the franchise owner, not just an employee.

I left the counter area and let her know how wrong it was. She came back to find me about 3 mins later with gift certificates to try and bribe me. I said to use them on replacing the others peoples food. She again said she wouldn't. For this location food safety is not a priority. 

I spoke to the GM of the area from Cara Foods who said they agreed it was handled poor but nothing could be done now.

I wouldn't advise to eat there, it's disgusting."}
{"text":"When the younger manager is working this location works very smoothly, if she's not there you'll wait a while and your food will live under a food lamp for a while.  Swiss Chalet Express is always quick and has their own till.

Again a Cara Foods operation so you get little for a high price..."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Always good. Reminds me of being a kid every time I taste their burgers. Having the burger your way is the best. Get whatever you want on the burger, as much as you want, and the staff is always happy to oblige.

Much different that the treatment at Subway where they try to skimp on all the toppings.

At Harvey's, want 8 pickles on your burger because you are a boss? No problem at all. Want pickles on the side with that, well no problem. Your way is the way.

There are better local burgers but that is by no means a bash on Harvey's. Their burgers are always freshly cooked, never taste off. Always so consistent over the past 20+ years I've been going there. Loved it as a kids, still love it as an adult.

My only gripe is the Pepsi deal. I want Diet Coke. Diet Pepsi doesn't cut it, I'll take it because I know that's all they have, but offering Coke products would put Harvey's on a whole new level.

Pickles, pickles, pickles, pickles, pickles. I love pickles and these guys love too oblige to my obsessive pickle cravings with a smile on their face.

A Canadian staple. Right along with Swiss Chalet. Same company, same quality food. The best is the Harvey's/Swiss combo restaurants. Harvey's or Swiss fries with Swiss Chalet dipping sauce. More Canadian than the Mackenzie brothers and Red Green combined."}
{"text":"This tiny hole in the wall on queens quay West is bundled with swiss chalet.  While they mean well, there always seems to be a problem ordering at the counter.  
After many \"so so\" experiences, I decided to give them a chance and order one of their newly  advertised \"make your own bowl\" which I wanted with the salad base option. 

They were out of a few vegetables  but when I asked if I can have the salad base with no carrots, I was told \"not problem\" yet ten minutes later (they appear to prepare the salad base in the back in the swiss chalet side), there were carrots on there.  The chicken was not thoroughly cooked and they replaced it with a cooked galette and as a result, the entire transaction took about 30+ minutes.  

The apologetic manager at the front counter was nice enough to acknowledge the mistake and gave me a free soda.  As I sat down, I heard the frustration of another lady who had an incorrect order yet, there were only two patrons in the dining room.  

No coupon or discount offer will convince me to come back; I'll pass by and stick to a sit down restaurant burger or salad for the price and annoyance; keep it moving!"}
{"text":"We had the Original burgers in combo. Maurice was not at his peak yesterday, but the Burger was the right temperature. The fries were excellent. I would say these burgers matched quality of those $12.00 burgers at two other places.  Once we had burgers that were a bit soggy, but this time was excellent.  I will return again as we enjoy our burgers and for two combos plus Pop Tart Ice Cream under $17.00 a deal. 
It was not busy at &:30 PM on a Tuesday night, but its summer and weather is hot."}
{"text":"Shawn gave it a 4??? 

Stay away from drivethru

Sitting and waiting behind the guy who ordered some silly item from swisschalet, you see your bags at the window getting cold, because they didnt build this location to park orders.. You get your food and its c.o.l.d... Lovely

Go in and get take out or dine in... Stay clear the drive... 3/5 if they ditched swiss chalet from drivethru"}
{"text":"Great Canadian, done well!"}
{"text":"Harvey's isn't usually my fastfood purveyor of choice. That would be A&W. I was in the area and decided to go since it was lunchtime and I was hungry.

The location is one of those Harvey/Swiss Chalet hybrids. It was clean and bright and very spacious. There were a lot of staff working so the line-up ran pretty quickly although I did have to wait a while for my Angus patty to be cooked. 

When I placed my order, I confirmed that the fries would be the Swiss Chalet fries before I ordered the fries. Usually at standalone Harvey's I just order the rings, but I'm a fan of Swiss Chalet fries so I thought I'd go with those. 

The fries I ended up getting were not what I would consider the standard Swiss Chalet fries. These were saltier, crispier, and less potatoey tasting. They were okay (aside from the excess salt), but the standard Swiss Chalet fries at standalone Swiss Chalet joints are so much better.

My angus burger was fine. Juicy, nice soft bun, topped as requested. The beef itself was fine, but ideally would have had a beefier flavour. What can you expect from a frozen fastfood burger though, right? No complaints with the burger.

Good location. I would come back here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Good burger like at all the Harveys, the fries were a little stale, the service was poor"}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the only franchise chains with a palatable veggie burger. Much better than KFC's, Subway's, Burger King's, and A&W. I really enjoy being able to see the toppings customized in front of me, also their mesquite sauce adds a nice smokey flavor to the burger. I will say that their interior needs a revamp, looks like a leftover from the early 80s and their staff is a little huffy, otherwise I'll be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place is just bs. Went there and asked specific for the poutine burger WITHOUT  bacon. Waited 15min it was night time and I was in the car when I was about to eat I saw  the bacon like wth I asked for without bacon. So I went inside the location the order lady told the kitchen guys without bacon and the kitchen guys told us she didn't told them.Like wth u guys need to decide anyways I left the food there and didn't even got a apologize. Anyways the guys who work in that location are a bunch of weirdos!!! NEVER RECOMMEND THE LOCATION!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great as usual... Harvey's is the only major chain that serves hot dogs and I love them for that. This location has the added bonus of being attached to a Swiss Chalet, which means you'll be getting Chalet fries . The huge downside at this location is the service. When I walked in and stood at the counter, I was ignored for minutes while the 4 staff members worked to service the drive thru customers. When I finally ordered, I was overcharged, which I really didn't appreciate, since I need my money to fight those bogus charges from Victoria's Secret. A couple  and  went to drive thru customers while I stood at the counter like a chump... long story short: if you're going to this location, do it in your car. #itiswhatitis"}
{"text":"I preffer Harveys' over Mc.Donald's , BK , Belle Province , Wendy's , A&W anytime. THE FACT I can have my burger anyway i like it at any mood i am in for."}
{"text":"It's burgers made sub style. Just like at Quizno's you pick what you want on your sub, you get to pick out what you want on your burger! What a concept! They just make the burger fresher!!! This was really good and a Montreal must try! (I'm not sure if they are in the states, but if there are, they should be some near me!)"}
{"text":"Worst Harvey's I've ever been to. Ever. Went thru drive thru, placed our order, and then he tells us to pull ahead, no price given, didn't repeat the order back to us. There's a car waiting ahead of us at the window... 5 mins later we get to the window, guy says NOTHING... NOT EVEN 1 WORD TO US, and puts the debit machine in my face! I had to then ask him how much our food is, he tells me just a min, then closes the window on us then walks away. He comes back and tells us the price, again pushes the debit in my face, when I have to almost yell to get his attention, so he can read our order back to us, he starts reading, but it's wrong, so I interrupt him to get the order right, he prints out our order and hands us a little piece of paper, he then goes and gets someone else, who then comes to the window, and tries to word things as if we are \"changing\" our order at the window, so I interrupt him, and make him understand that we are not changing our order at the window, we are CORRECTING THEIR MISTAKE, and to stop trying to make it like we got to the window and are now changing things. Now that they understand we're not idiots and will fight back, they decide to give us the items we ordered for free. We pay for our order, and wait some more. They finally start passing our food out, but we don't pull away, instead we start checking our bags to see if they got it correct or not, when the guy asks us if everything is ok, we tell him he has to wait while we check to make sure we got everything that we ordered, guess what? It was wrong. Once things are finally correct, we pull away from the window to a parking space, we look for our receipt so we can leave our complaint on their website, and surprise surprise, not only did they not give us a store receipt, they also didn't give us our debit receipt. We had to walk inside and ask for our receipts, which they had to dig out of the garbage cans... There was quite the pile of receipts.... I'm guessing they make a practise of not giving receipts so no one can prove how horrible this location is. I'm glad I live nowhere near this place, but at least I can warn other travellers to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Came here after lunch time at around 2:30pm looking for a snack. One couple ordering ahead of me and someone else waiting for their order. I'm seeing only 1 person behind the counter taking orders, running the register and building the order. The person waiting for the order is asking the person behind the counter how much longer will it take & that it's been 30mins. I suddenly decided this may take longer than 15mins before I get my food and this was not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Worst Harvey's ever! I ordered 3 hot dogs and told them I had a coupon 2 for $4. And I'd pay for the extra one. I waited about 5 minutes just in the drive true waiting to pay and there was only one other car. Then I waited another 5 minutes because they charged me for all 3 hot dogs at regular price even though I gave them the coupon. Then the lady only gave me 2 hot dogs and I asked her where the 3rd one was and she said I only charged you for 2. In the end she ended up getting it right but it took forever!"}
{"text":"This location needs to re-educate their employees on food hygiene.

1) The guy topping the burgers was handed a headset by a co-worker. He put on the headset, adjusted it and went back to assembling burgers without changing his gloves. 
2) While the burger guy went to the grill counter to get my burgers, another employee felt the need to clean the toppings station immediately. She removed my burger wrapper off the counter, sprayed cleaner on the counter (without even moving the bowls of toppings out of the way) proceeded to clean and then put my wrapper back on the counter. I asked for a new wrapper when the guy came back. I don't need to be eating cleaning solution. 

With all that being said, the burgers tasted fine."}
{"text":"As consistent as the chain is, this Harvey's was the first Harvey's to ever turn me down for 8 extra pickles on the side. Rather, they untruthfully claimed that they are not allowed giving me more than 6. It does little to weaken my love for Harvey's, but this certainly isn't one of my favourite locations."}
{"text":"This Harveys is at the entrance to the Home Depot there, but tastes just as good as any other Harveys location. I've eaten there ten or more times by now, and haven't been disappointed yet. I usually get a Great Canadian burger or a chicken burger, with their fries.

At lunch time it can have long lineups, but so does every other fast food place at that time."}
{"text":"Going for lunch? Get there AT noon to beat the line. They're ready for you though. Very efficient! Great job!"}
{"text":"Place is super busy but the staff get your order out quickly. It's a Harvey's so you know what the burgers are like. Not as healthy as hero burger but not as expensive either."}
{"text":"This Harvey's restaurant requires attention. A lot of attention. As a franchise it is really bad and does not compare to many of the various Harvey's restaurants I've been to. Service is poor and staff do not seem to care or have pride in working at this location. The restaurant is really run down. There door glass has been broken for the past year and has never been fixed. The drive through service is poor and staff do not seem to give a hoot how long you wait. You drive up to the ordering speaker and they make you wait for at least 10 mins. The are only 2 cars ahead of you and on 3 occasions I've waited 40 minutes to get to the pickup window. Once there the worker has to lift/pull the window which does not seem to work and has been that way for the past 2 years. They shove the interact to you and then you have to hold after processing your payment while they are working inside. They then get your order incorrect. Don't they understand what an \"apple pie\" is? I get home and I have a blueberry / cream filled pie which I then throw out."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant right off Taunton - perfect for after work pick-up. Now they have salad bowls with choice of topping just made it better. Always love Harvey's made to order burgers. Now even better w choices of salad, rice or fries. But the best part is the service - hard working young people that are polite and helpful. Win!"}
{"text":"Out of all fast food chains, this one is my fav for burgers. It is always so fresh and juicy. I've never had a bad burger here before. And I love love their poutine. I love it even more than places that specialize in making poutine. It has a rich gravy and the fries are soft. They give lots of cheese curds and it melts very well. My one complaint is that going through the drive thru here will kill a quarter tank of your gas. Because it's connected to Swiss chalet they take forever. So if you don't want to waste time then I would suggest going in the restaurant."}
{"text":"As far as Harvey's restaurants go, this one is the best, because as a combo Harvey's plus Swiss Chalet you get all the Harvey's burgers and charbroiled treats, but you get to pair them with fresh cut Swiss Chalet fries, gravies and sauces!

Now I am old enough to remember back in the day, when Harveys also had amazing fresh cut fries, before they went to their current Frozen / commissary-produced fries that are rather disappointing, but not this location! This location gives you the real deal \"best anywhere\" Swiss Chalet fries.

For those who don't know: Swiss Chalet fries are outstanding, as are the beefy gravy, Chalet sauce, and poutine offered by Swiss Chalet, and you can enjoy all of those with your delicious Harvey's charbroiled hamburger at this location.

For purely nostalgic reasons, as the food is really poor quality, neighbouring Johnny's hamburgers gets a lot of praise from folks who are probably too drunk to taste how weak and \"straight from the freezer\" everything at Johnny's tastes. However fret not, just a few doors down the street is the Harveys / Swiss Chalet drive through with much better food, fresh cut fries, high-quality gravy, plus whatever other Swiss Chalet treats you might want to add to your order.

So, unless you are drunk and it is 1 a.m., because Harveys closes around 10 p.m. most nights, do hit up Harvey's instead of Johnny's, and get a better quality Burger, with MUCH better french fries, plus no long wait nor parking nightmares of Johnny's, just a quick cruise through the very efficient drive through, and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The food here is at expectations for Harvey's, while the service is clearly very subpar. Pretty girl at the order station, but a very poor attitude and no customer service skills really hurt this place. Over 15 minutes from the time we ordered to getting our drinks and another 5 minutes for the food.. better staff and organization would help."}
{"text":"Visited this week as I was the first customer of the day there were no students yet so I was able to enjoy my burger with a side of peace and quiet. Great service as usual and burger cooked perfectly. I will be back when school is over for the summer."}
{"text":"Been to a many Harvey's in my day, but this one is definitely not my favourite. I will end up here if I'm getting a fast lunch between jobs as it's right beside the Starbucks I always go to. With that being said, the end product always tastes pretty good, but the overall service isn't the best. 

Always seems to be super busy at all times whenever I go, and the staff don't seem to be equipped to handle a large wave of customers. They move and work slowly, don't smile or thank you for your business, and glare at you when you ask for anything else. Not the ideal service you wanna get, even for a fast food joint. 

Luckily, the food itself seems fine. I will probably end up here again when I'm rushing between jobs, but wouldn't recommend this Harvey's location if you're specifically looking for Harvey's."}
{"text":"6/30

It's not often that there's food I can eat at a fast food chain, so Harvey's makes me ridiculously happy when I'm craving a burger and fries (and want to keep it under $10). 

Their veggie burger is probably one of the best I've tasted in the city. So often; places get them either too dry, too solidified-bean-dip-esque, too starchy, too gross. Which isn't to say that I don't appreciate the effort, when so many restaurants won't even bother. 

What's great too, is that if you email Harvey's to make sure the ingredients are vegan friendly, you'll get a response in less than 12 hours. Which again, is more than you can say for many local not-a-chain restaurants. Everything at Harvey's is made to order, so you don't have to worry about your veggie burger sitting on a conveyor belt with all the meat burgers, and you can get as little or as much of every topping as you want. In this location, you can even see them cooking it separately from all the other burgers. 

Hi-five, Harvey's!"}
{"text":"It does the job, but there are better options now with five guys a block or two away.

The Angus Burger seems to be getting smaller each time I get it.

The people who work here do an admirable job of keeping this place tidy and trouble free, since it's on one of the filthiest blocks come night time."}
{"text":"Delicious - so good that we ate there twice within 2 hours! The food is made to order, assembly line style...similar to Subway, Quiznos, etc. - however Harvey's specializes in delicious burgers instead of subs, and it rules!

You can't go wrong with whatever you get there. My favorite is the veggie burger (and I'm not a vegetarian) w/ the frings (fries & onion rings mixed together)."}
{"text":"Harvey's burgers to me are a great burger. They beat Rockin' Ronnie's and Wendy's any day. The burgers are flame broiled, their fries and rings are good too. I don't like huge onion rings and Harvey's tends to use small onions which is fine by me. 

I had the double original burger with cheese and a side poutine. I normally get the fries but I have a two hour dentist appointment tomorrow to get two crowns put in so my face will be frozen like a backyard ice rink in northern Ontario in January. I probably won't be able to drink eat or talk very well. 

The meal was a little pricey with the combo upgrade to poutine, $13.42 including Justin Trudeau's share. The food is great, staff are friendly and pleasant. Harvey's does make a hamburger a beautiful thing!"}
{"text":"My favourite harveys in the world. Amazing staff. Food is hot and perfect everytime. Also they have new kickass slushies now!"}
{"text":"Service at this place is always less than par. They are very stingy with their servings, and food is always stale, burnt, or the bottom of the barrel quality. I have attached photos of today's service. The hotdog is so over cooked, and old that it tasted like mystery rubber. The fries are shorter than a centimetre, and the ones that are longer are dry, over fried and full of oil. Prior to this experience, I have purchased a burger that seemed to have been dropped on the floor and put back in the bun because it was full of small rock particles, when I returned it to the manager, she argued with me about what I felt in my mouth so I fished out a few Little Rock's to shower her, she took my name, apologized and said I could get a free meal next time I come. When I came the next time, she forgot my face, forgot the incident, and said I can't get a free meal. I don't recommend this place. There are plenty of really nice restaurants in the area that respect their customers, have great food, and will give you a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Um, EWWW!! Whatever they gave me between that bun was definitely not a good burger. Ick!"}
{"text":"This place just opened a couple of months ago and I finally bit the bullet and got a burger.

I'm not a HUGE fan of Harvey's burgers, and like all fast-food chains, the food is exactly the same from location to location. They had the same fixins' and burgers. The service was very friendly, though, and the place was very clean. 

If I liked their food more, I probably would have given them a better star rating.

I'll probably be back... on Christmas day when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"We walked right up to the counter and ordered from a nice lady. As we moved on to the condiment section, one of the servers was new so things were quite a bit slower than usual for a Harvey's. We tried the new 3 cheese and bacon Angus burger which were definitely not worth the money for what we got. We figured out that we could have went to the attached Swiss Chalet and been much more satisfied foe the same price."}
{"text":"Harvey's.  Long live the grill.  It's a relatively inexpensive meal these days and perhaps it's the quick and dirty, mixed with nostalgia, that does it for me.  I'll like to have \"The Corsican\", i.e. Angus burger with lettuce, onions, lots of pickles, hot peppers, mustard and ketchup, either onion rings or fries and an iced tea.  I swear anytime I get this I'm full for the rest of the day.  It's terrible, I know, but once in a while won't kill you."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Harvey's i've been too. The older man who I believe to be the manager or owner is rude to customers and staff. He got my order wrong and blamed his employees who had nothing to do with it."}
{"text":"I haven't had Harvey's in the longest time, just the other day I decided to get a burger on my way home. 

I ordered the Crispy Chicken combo, before placing the order the person did tell me the wait is about 10 mins. Which I was fine with, since there were about 3 cars in front of me. As I made my way up, the girl that was taking my payment was so out of it. She looked like she didn't even want to be there, her vibe was rude. As I waited for my order she just passed the bag to me and just closed the window without even saying a word. Since the last time I have been here the people have changed, they don't really care about the customers. 

The fries at Harvey's are also amazing, they tasted just the way it used too. But the burger had all the toppings I did want on it but no sauce at all. I had told her I wanted chipotle sauce and little bit of mayo. The burger tasted plain because there was no sauce. This was the first time, the burger I had ordered didn't have the right ingredients. Probably won't be going back to this Harvey's in the near future."}
{"text":"Not impressed either, like earlier review. Messed up my order and my coworkers.. Got our condiments messed up too. He apologized quickly, but mistakes like these shouldn't even happen.. Wrong condiments? Wtf.. Lol food was still good!"}
{"text":"Hadn't had a Harvey's burger in a very long time so it was nice to have again!  Nothing special just Harvey's but it was really good! Would come back!"}
{"text":"As an American who had only heard of Harvey's on \"How I Met Your Mother\" I was a little skeptical at first regarding eating here.  But, I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality of the burger, toppings and fries.  Overall, I think this place is great and I'm now putting together a fact finding blue ribbon commission comprised of myself and Ms. Betty Childs to get Harvery's down here in the states."}
{"text":"I came here specifically to check out their new updated 2.0 toppings. I ordered their cheese stuffed burger and it was amazing! New toppings are very similar to subway's toppings. I am glad that they still have their signature pickles. Overall I welcome the new change, but I'm pretty sure that some people will have nostalgia for the old toppings especially the diced onions."}
{"text":"Cold limp fries were served to us, with more than quarter of the fries being those tiny bits of crumbs of potato. Cold and limp!  We also ordered two smoothies, and one was given to us half full, when I asked for a full glass I was given an unfriendly reply, 'the machine did this, not me.'
All this would not have brought me here to write this if the staff were happy smiling and friendly. I don't think they're serving Harveys to us there. That's a tired looking bunch of people who don't want to work there."}
{"text":"What's not to like for two burgers fries or onion rings and two drinks for $11+ taxes for CAA members?

They will give us Veggie Burgers on a whole grain bun and all the toppings we like including guacamole and tzatziki. We top with onion rings and sometimes even with fries!

The burgers delicious, perfectly cooked fries and onion rings and we sometimes upgrade the fries to a Poutine of which the gravy is vegetarian as well. 

The location was clean, staff cheerful and the staff cheerful. The staff that assembled the burger was amazing and made the burger just the way we requested it."}
{"text":"2.5 stars out of 5

Average Harvey's place.  Bought the original burger combo.  Everything was pretty much what you would expect.  Did Harvey's change their fries?  They look like New York fries with the skin on.  Also, the fries are so much shorter.  Are all Harvey's restaurants doing this?  I hope not...

Jan 2017 - Update
The fries at the Harvey's at Markville were much better."}
{"text":"The food was okay, no complaints there but the speed was not.  Waited about 20 minutes in line to get to the cashier.  We ordered a original burger and a grilled chicken burger at 1:33pm and got the food at 2pm so a totally of 50 minutes for 'fast food'.  The guy at the cashier was asking us to get our Scene cards ready to speed up the ordering process but what he failed to see was that the food wasn't coming out fast enough, not the ordering.  As a result, there were many people who had ordered but we're waiting for their food in the cramped space.  There were people behind us who got their food before us.  It didn't seem like the staff wanted to serve you anyways (they looked like they were on training), probably because they were working on Canada Day."}
{"text":"I don't usually review fast food restaurants, but I really gotta hand it to this particular Harvey's restaurant, they do a really good job! Service is fast and friendly, burger assembly is as per customer's request so some wait in line is understandable. But overall their staff are what impress me the most. What I see are a group of ambitious young ones showing efficiency behind the counter. There is one passionate staff we used to see working the sandwich bar who sings on his job! It is a well-led team who, at the end of the day, make it all work :) Their sit-in area gets busy at times, since it is a busy bus stop area, and the place can get a bit messy. Their clean-up can get a little behind, bare with them! But once you find a place to sit and bite into your burger.. or munch on those Swiss Chalet fries, you forget about the bad stuff that's around. Not many Harvey's in the city, but I'm glad this one's here and getting a lot of business. It's a happenin' place!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Harvey's in years. That said, I was pleasantly surprised at what their menu has to offer now. Lots of topping options. Bowls are offered now. We still got burgers. They were smaller than other burger joints, but it tasted good!!! I loved being able to add cucumbers and olives to my burger. Most places don't have toppings like that. TVs on the walls. Lots of seating. Nicer than what I had expected. 
The cashier was so friendly. Our fries weren't ready in time, so she said she'd bring them over to us. When she did walk the fries over, she made sure we had ketchup. What fast food place has service like this?"}
{"text":"Harvey's workers here need a shot of adrenaline, very slow service. Order taking is very troublesome, long wait times and cashiers getting confused. It was Canada Day so I don't mind the wait cause we're CANADIAN! Will forgive you for that. The joint Swiss Chalet take-out order taking seemed to confuse these guys even more. Old guy at the front of the line arguing about his order, charged too much and it just went on from there. 

I was annoyed with receiving wilted lettuce in my burger, toppings weren't stocked and lacked freshness. One of the girls watches her colleague standing around says, \"hey can you get stuff? I'm out.\" I hope she brought fresh greens when I was gone! 

Be more accretive, tons of burgers sitting on the heating lamp waiting for vegetables. Hell the manager should take charge, jump in and serve instead of barking orders around. Good marks for the onions rings well done, but don't even get me started on the leftover french fries that weren't fresh. 

I love Harvey's! Best fast food burger joint, beat McDonald's and Burger King by a mile. I'll be visiting other locations. Take my bad review and improve on it, who knows, you'll get 5 stars from someone else. Certainly won't be from me."}
{"text":"This place is good for one main(excluding the attached Swiss chalet) And that is the burgers. The hot dogs are a major disappointment. they taste like something you could've boiled at home. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Harvey's promotion, 2 Originals for $6.00 is back till March 13. Dining room is clean, good customer service, nice job topping the burgers with fresh condiments. 

Amazing onion rings and the apple pie is a great dessert after your burger."}
{"text":"Went in for the poutine and free refills 

My gf got a burger and found it a little overly salty however satisfying (thank god for the refills) 

Poutine had wonderful gravy and cheese curds however the fries were a slight let down 

Good place to sit and eat"}
{"text":"I love Harvey's and they've slowly been closing all the ones on the east coast where I'm from so I'm happy to have it close again. I think I must be going to a completely different restaurant than the other reviewers, though. While the food at this location is awesome the staff has been questionable every time I've been there. Several times I've walked in and they've all just been standing around, four of them cooking one burger for the one dude in front of me and I wait... and wait... and wait... and eventually get to order. Then EVERY single time I pay here they will say \"Do you have 10 cents?\" or \"Do you have 14 cents?\" or what have you. I've worked behind a cash register. I understand sometimes you run out of change. Literally they ask every time, though. If I had a dime or wanted to give you a dime you would have been provided with such dime. Just take my money and make change. Ugh. And finally, twice I have ordered poutine. Paid for poutine. Waited upward of five minutes for poutine. Then been advised there is no gravy. I figure that's something the staff should have known in such a small place, but whatever, just refund me. Only they wait on everyone else in the line before refunding me. I dunno. I'll keep going back because it's close but I always leave scratching my head."}
{"text":"I don't really write about fast food restaurants, but I enjoy the layout of this restaurant.  There are booths in the middle of the restaurant, the menu has both Swiss chalet and Harvey's on the take out side. 

They have monthly coupons which make it a pretty good deal. Had the 1/4 pound Angus burger combo for 6.49. You get to dress your own burger, but I found they use different ingredients than other Harvey's. 
Their lettuce is one piece (not shredded like others), they use red onions thinly sliced, and they have cucumber! 
Made my burger that much more awesome, and the service is quite friendly and efficient.  Restaurant is clean. 

We upgraded our fries from the combo with frings (onion rings and fries), it's 2 separate compartments, so you don't get less, and awesome for variety!! And they filled it to the top."}
{"text":"This Harvey's is on the way home from work, so whenever I am craving for a veggie burger, I make sure I get it here, from Harvey's.

They are known for one of the best veggie burger options in the GTA, and it is true, their veggie burgers are awesome!

Whenever I come here, it's always busy, no matter what time of the day, and I am surprised there wasn't much reviews of this place.

Service is still very quick despite the volume of orders, and quality is consistent.

There was just one time I remember ordering the veggie burger and I forgot to say white bun, and I believe they always defaulted to the white bun, but this time, I got a whole wheat one, which I don't prefer. I have made a note to myself to always specify white bun when I order the veggie burger.

Over-all, I would keep coming back whenever I crave for veggie burgers."}
{"text":"What a dirty filthy place. I will never go there again. Only 3 of the fountain pop worked, my feet stuck to the floor, all tables were dirty, all garbage was over flowing and garbage on the floor in front of garbage cans. Poor service. My hands were stinky from just touching items in that cesspool. No way never again."}
{"text":"If you dare walk along Eglinton through the Crosstown LRT construction, you'll find this Harvey's just a block east of Yonge. 

This is one of those hybrid locations where you can also order Swiss Chalet items. So in other words, you can come here looking for Swiss Chalet and find a Harvey's sharing the location.

For both shared establishments, it's essentially a take-out counter but if you order Swiss Chalet and choose to dine-in, they'll bring out your food on a plate but there is no formal wait staff which I guess means you don't need to leave a tip. (since you paid up front?)

For Harvey's they seem to offer everything you can get at any other location. I believe it's the same with Swiss Chalet?

Being a Swiss Chalet fries lover, I think the big bonus for me with this location is that if you order fries with your Harvey's meal, you get Swiss Chalet fries. Not sure if this is standard at other hybrid locations but this scores points with me."}
{"text":"We came here for our lunch on a snowy day after searching on Yelp where to eat. The restaurant looks very clean and nice. After looking at the menu, my ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the triple cheese bacon burger. The order process came smoothly. Here come the part that made me rate this 2 stars: the customizing our sandwiches. The lady that made our sandwich was very absent minded and looked very mean. I had to repeat what I wanted twice, she didn't ask what I wanted more what my sandwich and immediately wrapped it up. The sandwich my husband ordered was the original one instead of the triple cheese, so we asked the lady that took our order and she said: \"Oh, I thought you wanted the original\". Then my husband asked for the toppings for his sandwich and that lady acted like the we were beggar asking for food. I will never come back again. And I you guys want to come here for food, don't expect them to treat you well."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great service, and amazing food (as always)! The restaurant is well kept and well run!"}
{"text":"Very strange Harvey's/ Swiss Chalet.  You can't see or find any sign of the Harvey's in the parking lot or front entrance of the Swiss Chalet.  Only from Taunton Road.  

Service was good, burgers are just okay.   Not a big fan of Harvey's anyways.  This was a stop of convenience.  Burger patties always taste like there is a lot of filler in them.  Non meat like texture to it.  Fries okay.  

Probably won't have another Harvey's for another year."}
{"text":"If it were open later than 10:30pm, Harvey's would be the perfect spot for some late night munchies. The drunk crowds of young people and stoners who are marching along Crescent are likely to find the junk food worthy menu just right. Depending on one's sobriety the tasty factor will be somewhere in the middle or magically delicious. Judging by the star rating, it's pretty easy to figure out where I was.

For visitors from the states, Harvey's is essentially the Canadian equivalent of A&W. There are the standard fast food versions of burgers, all of which are assembled in plain view. Don't want lettuce or thousand island? Tell them on the spot and they'll build the burger the way you want it to look. Throw in some soggy fries, a small drink, and about $6 CAD, and that's a meal. The burgers, undersized with a skimpy patty, were mediocre as expected.

The real allure of Harvey's for me was poutine. It can be had anywhere really, especially those patati or diner joints that specialize in it. But my group and I were hungry and it was a little later, so Harvey's it was. I went for chicken fingers that were actually quite good and an order of poutine for some of the boys to try. The messy mix of cheese curds, gravy, and soggy frites weren't impressive enough for a consensus thumbs up. After trying it myself, I also agreed it was too bland for my liking. Damn those fast food posters for alluring us in.

Another bit of fun from Harvey's are the crowds. The later it gets into the night, the nuttier the bunch of patrons become. Curious tourists, tough guy thuggy Canadians, and Quebecois speaking only folks tend to dominate the scene. Most of which are men as well - no ideas on how this came to be. Before anyone accuses me of generalizing, this was based on three separate trips. Yikes - maybe I wasn't sober after all."}
{"text":"I am a burger lover, and I visit burger places just to check how they are. I had one with a double patty and it was really a drag to finish it, tasteless, had to put ketchup to bring taste to it. The place looked a bit dirty, the garbage bin came off when i was there so garbage was scattered on the floor. Not recommended if you are looking for a good burger, i would suggest going to Johnnys which is right beside it."}
{"text":"Pretty good Harvey's location with the added bonus of being able to get as wise Chalet at the same time. Drive thru mid-day was reasonably quick. Food was fresh and good. Service was courteous."}
{"text":"Location: next to Swiss Chalet, on Markham Road across the street from Staples. 
Service: usually great,  they use gloves or wash hands prior to making your burger
burgers: 3-4/5, always loved harveys.
Order your burger and pick your toppings and they put it for you. 
Usually a damn good burger. 
Pretty good poutine as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the weirdest Harvey's I have ever been to.  So, for starters, getting into the parking lot here is a bit complicated, especially if you're approaching from the east.  Once you get there, it's also weird.  The guy behind the counter told me a better promotion with better food that they used to have, that isn't available anymore.  The guys cooking the food don't seem to follow the system, where they make food based on chits or something.  The staff have to yell back to tell them what to make.  The girl assembling the burgers seems awkward about waiting for the burgers to come out.  Once you sit down, a weird guy walks around cleaning tables.  He was doing that for about 15 minutes...which isn't bad, but there are only 15 tables in the whole place.  The food itself was ok, tastes like Harvey's, but it was totally weird.  That's all."}
{"text":"Standard fare for burgers in term of fast food that is. Not on the same category as five guys or South street burger. 

I sadly decided to try their build your bowl. 
Nastiest thing I ever ate. 

The base of half rice and salad with crispy chicken. 

NOTE: you can choose fries as the base. But there is NO WAY it could taste good.

Sorry Harvey's. Good idea bad execution. 

Rice was mushy and over cooked. 

Flavours weren't right.

Generously giving it a 3 just for the onion rings. Burgers are meh."}
{"text":"Service is great. Prices have gone up and the patties have gotten smaller. No wonder all these other burger places are opening up. These chains are finally getting a run for their money and have no clue how to keep up anymore. Ooooh well, it was good while it lasted... Holy Chucks, here we come..."}
{"text":"Can I give it 2.5 stars?

The line up management is poor! Only 1 single girl, who looked terrified, to add all the toppings to all the orders during the LUNCH HOUR? She was SLOW as fucking MOLASSES. I think she had shut down and was going through the motions.

Madness!

I was even tempted for a brief moment to do a supply chain management MBA project to resolve this. But then, I immediately regained my sanity.

I was so famished I could have murdered a cow, so the burger tasted delicious and so did the fries. I like that they include guacamole and salsa as part of their toppings selection."}
{"text":"This is a very friendly Harveys. If you go in the workers are very friendly and efficient This Harvey's you can choose between Swiss Chalet or Harveys, nice touch. The drive thru,is great. One time they messed up my order they gave me a $5 credit. Which I happily used when I went back. The food I always enjoy."}
{"text":"Harvey's serves good burgers that's actually worth the price you're paying for. It's obviously not the best but for the value of your money, definitely worth it I'd say.

There's usually a lot of coupons that you can use at Harvey's which makes your dollar more of a value of what you're getting. I would suggest the Angus burger for a little fortune more but taste of the meat is definitely better that its regular burger.

The speed of service is usually quite fast, besides on weekends where there's a 10-15 min wait for your burger to be ready but considering that, it's still fast! You can choose between fries or onion rings when you place your order. Onion rings are the best here! Always something I get when I get a meal.

Once your burger is ready, one of the employees will assist you in choosing toppings and dressings for your burger. You can basically add as much as you want to it, making it double or even triple its size. LOL  I usually ask for extra sauce on the side so you can have a different dipping sauce then just plain ketchup. Sometimes depending on which employee serves you, you might get more or less of what you want on your burger.

Did I mention that you can also collect SCENE points when you make purchases? They don't ask for your points card but if you hand them your card as you pay, they will swipe it for you!

Overall, this is one of my favorite, quick and cheap eats on a lazy weekend. Have been there multiple of times and every time it does satisfy me when I leave!"}
{"text":"A fairly new location attached with a Swiss Chalet right across from Sunny Food Mart. Their service is slow at times, especially during lunch and dinner, but their staff are friendly and don't skimp on the toppings! I don't know if this applies to other locations as well because I only tend to frequent this one, but one of the downsides would be that their fries are ALWAYS soggy! Not a huge fan, so I only get their onion rings when buying a combo."}
{"text":"Horrible service. People ahead of me waited 25 minutes before asking where their food was - they had no record of it!. Other people got the wrong food. There were so many people waiting that someone with the same order as I had, grabbed my food although she was well behind me in the ordering line and the staff member preparing the food knew it but was unwilling to say so.
 The manager finally came out to take orders but just kept saying \"Your food will be out in a moment\" to all complaints. It took real pushing to get her to do anything."}
{"text":"Place is clean and very spacious! Love the fish burger I got as a combo with drink amd fries. Love that Harvey's gives you the option placing whatever you want on your burgers!"}
{"text":"Amazingly competent Skip the Dishes order. Lots of order notes and requests that were perfectly followed. Thanks for making sure the Frings were full!"}
{"text":"$7.50 for a burger??   Worth it.

had a guiness bbq bacon cheeseburger.  Wow.  Delicious.  Nice to choose your own toppings, similar to subway.  Burger came to $7.44, combo was close to $9.00  

They have new patties, seem very high quality.  

Open til 10pm, which is nice.  I will be back."}
{"text":"fish was raw when came home from takeout!!!hope we don't get sick. grrr....we did get sick ....phoned them no one answers....great service"}
{"text":"Love me some Harvey's!!! The veggie burger is excellent, looks and tastes like their original patty,  and I love all the fixins.  Crispy onion rings and good fast food poutine. This particular location always has friendly workers and is easy in easy out. It's a smaller dining room so be prepared or stop by for take out. No complaints for this place when I need my Harvey's fix while visiting family in Markham."}
{"text":"Three or four? Three or four? Three or four?

I have eaten here several times. Four stars because the burgers are good for the price and the staff is friendly. Two for slow service.

If they wanted to improve, which they could,they would address a few things.

1. The speed of service. It is painfully slow. They should have a system where they give  a coupon or something for wait times over 3 minutes. Mine was seven.
2. The drive thru service. It is even slower. The people who use the drive thru here must like air pollution.
3. The restaurant could be cleaner. The floors are often greasy.
4. They should upgrade their lettuce. It is the pale, chopped yellow-green stuff that clearly came out of a bag. If you are showcasing the stuff as \"prepared fresh before your eyes\", it ought to look fresh as well.
5. The burgers are better than McDonald's, but not way better or in a league with Five Guys.

I enjoy eating here, and know they could improve."}
{"text":"Worst harveys in the city. Had to bring my fries back because they were stale. And one time all the staff were openly eating food while prepping my burger! The franchise owner should be ashamed."}
{"text":"As far as burger joints go......this place is not bad...plus it's in my neighbourhood so I drop in maybe once a month for a hit of grease. This location is attached to a Swiss Chalet and you can order items from that menu here as well.
On this particular visit, I ordered that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich....excellent considering it was \"fast food\" food. I added to it Chipotle sauce and lettuce and it was actually very tasty and as an added bonus the bun was fresh !
The fries are top notch......far better than those at other fast food joints.
Staff here have always been uber friendly. On my most recent visit I went to get a pop refill and the male employee who was working cash (took our order) was out tidying the dining area. He wished me a good night......WOW. Very good service....although he ruined what would have been a great moment by calling me \"sir\"."}
{"text":"Refused to accept my bonus offer card that was attached to all gift cards. Wouldn't acknowledge or even look into it, said I need a printed coupon yet the card they sold me with barcode for scanning specifically says \"Keep this bonus card and get $175 in coupon savings at 10+ restaurants\" Harvey's being one of them, unfortunately the card is in English.

Complaint filed with Head Office, avoid this location and their lack of knowledge & disrespectful attitude."}
{"text":"Great poutines, service is okay. Great for late night snack but be aware they close pretty early"}
{"text":"Don't bother doing a drive through.  Every single time we've been here the drive through seems to take twice the time it would take to get out of your car and walk in. Although I've never walked in so maybe the service is ridiculously SLOW no matter which way you order.

Updating to 3-Star since almost immediately after my review was posted, someone from the business reached out to discuss my concerns. I'm assuming they want to address the issue so kudos for that. 
And the Poutine was phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered two of the new build-a-bowl's here.  The lady was being stingy and asked me for an original of the coupon (while there was no such thing as it is an online promotion, other locations don't even require a coupon).  Then when it came to the toppings she was trying to cheap out, giving me tiny portions and I had to remind her several times of the other toppings I had requested.

I understand some location managers yell at their staff for giving too much toppings.  I guess this is one of them."}
{"text":"Very slow service.  Burgers come out burnt.  I waited 30 min and still no burger.  Ended up leaving empty handed as I had an appointment to go to.  Others were also tired of waiting."}
{"text":"I got a burger and poutine.  I did not like the burger, and they were both too salty."}
{"text":"Not a bad place if you're in a rush for a quick bite. I prefer Harvey's over McDonald's every time. The burgers are super tasty (they always add a pickle -love that)! It's pretty well priced for what you get but it really adds up if you come here often. In a high traffic location (St Clair and Bathurst) which is easy to get to. The seating is limited but enough for all your needs!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Went in tonight because drive through machine was broken.  After several reasonable drive thru visits, this was my first in store visit here.  BRUTAL, maybe worst fast food experience ever!  Staff was brutal, disorganized, confused, slow...and I think the owner or manager was on the grill!

Debit machine broken at drive through, out of all buns but whole wheat, out of ice, lids for drinks.  Condiments had tons of flies on them.  Deep fried pickles seemed to be sitting cooked for a long time, then re-fried.  Gross.

Bad night or absolute embarrassment to a good brand?

***we wrote to Harvey's corporate to report how bad this place is.  Got back a form email and credit for 20 bucks.  Didn't really ask for that, just wanted them to straighten this place out.  Form letter left us with feeling this won't happen.  C'est la vie.***"}
{"text":"Had to wait as they put my order tray on top so peoplethat came After me were served before me so the manager gave me a large fries instead of the medium I'd ordered when I got them I noticed pretty much all of them were tiny pieces of fries I gave them back and the cashier offered me anew order but I just wanted to leave at that point"}
{"text":"Pretty good hamburger 's for a junk food franchise. Good crispy fries well cooked, etcetera"}
{"text":"Best burger in north america. You're now given an opportunity to make your food relativity healthy by adding a whole grain bun with no processed cheese, the fresh veggies are a nice touch as well, Patty is just unbelievably juicy and fries are all right considering I'm not a fry fan"}
{"text":"This is pretty much exactly what you can expect from Harvey's but since it is a shared location with Swiss Chalet, they serve the Swiss Chalet fries and it tastes terrible.

Overall the place is clean and location is convenient. I think 3 stars is relatively high for fast food so this is actually a positive review!"}
{"text":"I tried the original double with bacon. Not bad, but not good. It was definitely a fast food burger. The poutine was ok, but I won't order it there again. If I'm going to consume that many calories it should be delicious."}
{"text":"Had Buffalo Chicken sandwich, it was not that bad.   My friend ordered chicken tenders, it was horrible.   Good place for people who had drinking.   Nice environment."}
{"text":"I LOVED Harvey's when I was a kid. So I was super-psyched when this new location opened across the street from me. Harvey's was always my favourite fast food joint, but I'm awarding the perfect rating based heavily on the fact that the people who run and work at this location are AWESOME. 

Never in my 34 years of eating fast food have I ever encountered such friendly and pleasant people slinging burgers behind the bar. Seriously. I was a bit weirded-out at first, as this is a real rarity in the service industry. Genuinely happy and well-adjusted people making my burgers? Really?

But I've visited this place about a dozen times now, and I'm always greeted warmly when ordering, and given a sincere \"Thank You!\" with a smile when I leave the place, even when the place is rammed with customers and they're super-busy. 

I'm probably gonna gain a few pounds from giving this place more of my business, but it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"The worst experience. Grilled chicken sandwich was cold, hard rubber with a hint chlorine. The fries were under the heat lamp when we arrived, and those same fries were served to me. I had to ask for fresh ones. My burger was cold. And let me tell you about the friendly, energetic staff - Not. Talk about a bunch of unhappy workers. What a horrible place."}

Except the ginger ale fountain drink was too carbonated.

Chairs were sticky.
Bathrooms are dark.

We ordered some combos, one of our kids found a potato chunk in their fries.
You figure whomever was scooping the fries would have spotted a huge chunk of potatoes.

Kids found it funny, I didn't.

{"text":"They share a building with Swiss Chalet and it was built less than a year ago (so everything is nice and new).  The staff were friendly and quick. They even make sure the toppings are fresh (there were only small pickles so he went and got more)."}
{"text":"I had a pretty unpleasant experience at this Harvey's location.  So much so that this is going to be only my third 1 star review ever.

The man behind the counter, who appeared to be a manager of some sort, was very rude.  My friend ordered a chicken wrap, the man entered buffalo wings on the cash register (we could see because it shows on the customer-facing display).  When my friend pointed this out, the man basically told him to ignore this, saying \"You're going to get your food anyway!\".  He continued speaking with this attitude throughout the entire ordering process, and we were so stunned we didn't know how to react.

I had a Nutella milkshake (of course) which I'll go into further detail with shortly.

While preparing the chicken wrap, the employees assembled the ingredients with bare hands, I didn't see them wash their hands at any point.  One employee answered a call on his cell phone (again, no gloves) and didn't wash his hands afterwards.  I'm pretty sure this contravenes the health code - it certainly put us off.

Now for the milkshake.  One employee brought out a blender (something like this: https://goo.gl/images/hirrrY) with the beater stick attached, and the power cord wrapped around the exposed beater stick then going around the back of the machine.  I didn't register it until afterwards, but this was the power cord that probably spent some time on the ground, and the beater was completely exposed.  They never cleaned it before making my milkshake with it!

I'm too stubborn to give up a milkshake so I drank it anyways, but don't be an idiot like me!  I'll probably get salmonellosis.

I don't intend to ever return to this location, and I would strongly caution you to think twice as well."}
{"text":"My problem with this place mainly stems from my most recent visit. Usually I have no issues at cash, but I came here last Sunday with a 2 Can Dine offer of 2 Original combos for $10.99. I went to cash at Harveys and there was no line in front of me. I said \"2 Can Dine\" and SHOWED the cashier my coupon. She apparently put in 2 Can Dine for Swiss. Okay, no problem, just reverse and continue right? Well apparently she didn't know how to cancel the order so someone else came. That person was able to cancel the order and put my order in for the coupon. I said I wanted to pay by VISA but to \"redeem my SCENE points first\". This cashier added SCENE points rather than redeeming. When I corrected her, she didn't know how to redeem. She kept mentioning that she should get a manager, and asked two people while she waited...who also did not know how to redeem SCENE points...who ALSO said to get a manager. Look, at this point I've been waiting for over 10 minutes standing in one spot being told that the cashier needs to go get the manager. Yet here she stands in front of me, not getting a manager. Or maybe someone called the manager for her and their manager doesn't care that I've already been waiting for 10 minutes? I was patient externally but lowkey judging internally. Look, I understand not being readily trained for the job, but for EVERYONE to be in the dark as to redeeming SCENE? Why are you a SCENE partner if you can't train your employees right? 

So after those 10 minutes, a female manager finally drops by and quickly does the redemption on the register, but walks away for half a minute to grab a card that needed to be swiped so the redemption can be complete. FINALLY, I get my receipt. No apologies for the wait or incompetence of the staff members. Only me in line...at a \"fast food\" chain...waiting at cash for 10 minutes. Should I have been more angry? Probably. Well, that's what Yelp is for. 

At this point, only one other person was behind me, an older gentleman. He was told his food would be ready in 30 minutes and he started arguing saying he ordered an hour ago. I walked away from the argument, not surprised at their incompetence... 

The only good from this visit it that my food is prepared quickly, and well done.

Train your weekend staff better."}
{"text":"Harvey's grilled chicken. Inaudible.  How can a restaurant connected with Swiss Chalet have such horrible chicken sandwich. ?????Burgers are great."}
{"text":"We got take out here.  I ordered the fish burger and it was the best I've ever had!  Way better than the filet of fish! They coat the patty with panko. Onion rings are meh. 


I like how they let you customize the sauce and veggies. Service was quick. This is a cheap meal alternative."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite hang outs. They have a pretty good crew here. I have experienced nothing but the best service even when they are very busy.

The burger you get is nice and hot and made to order. As expected with Harvey's, you can select your sides with no hassles."}
{"text":"The cook is quick it seems but the severs are slow, it takes forever to go through the drive thru at this location. But the burgers are freshly cooked. It's more medium paced food than fast."}
{"text":"It's attached to the Swiss chalet. The restaurant is usually clean with friendly staff. The food is always great though the drive-thru tends to get a little long. The place where you line up to order Harvey's is the same line for Swiss chalet take-out."}
{"text":"I have been to the Swiss Chalet side of this dual Harvey's-Swiss Chalet location. I decided to cross over the dark side... haha!

Actually, Harvey's has a nice decor. There are plenty of windows to let the sun in. There are some nice booths, chairs, and seats, too. It looks like it was renovated recently. Even the washroom was stylish. 

The last Harvey's that I visited made me afraid of dining there again. I ordered a fish burger that was greasy and gross! I had enough courage yesterday to try a different location. I'm glad that I did.

I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger. It was great with lots of sautéed mushrooms, which I love. Try the garlic mayo. It sealed the deal. 

I normally don't like fries because I'm sick of having it as a side. These fries were good. I ate the whole box, which is rare for me these days. 

I would come back here. Staff were helpful and friendly. I'd give it a 3.5-star rating. It is an above-average Harvey's."}
{"text":"I love Harvey's. Great burgers great toppings. Includes leaf lettuce, cucumbers black olives jalapenos. Efficient careful service. You really get what you want and they also offer battered pickles and shakes. This location has a Swiss Chalet next door so you can indulge in rotisserie chicken if you want as well."}
{"text":"Local Harveys is pretty decent, it is also connected to a Swiss Chalet.

Usually I pass by for a quick burger, and they are usually clean, fast, and friendly. Place does get busy since people know this. They offer the Scene points as well when you buy, so make sure to have it with you in order to get those free movies peoples!

Angus burgers are awesome."}
{"text":"Restaurant always smell like meat, you enter for 1 second and your entire outfit is RUINED! I stepped into the store to grab something really quick and I couldn't get the meat smell off of me!!!!
Second, they switched their poutine containers to PLASTIC, causing less amount that is given...really unhappy"}
{"text":"This is a standard Harvey's but with staff who don't care and seem to hate their jobs. I ordered the Angus and got burnt buns. When I told them I wanted buns that weren't toasted black, they only changed the top of the bun and the bottom was still burnt.

The manager and cashier are ruthless as they let me wait in line for minutes before letting me know they were ready to take my order. They kind of just ignored me as I was right in front of the till and waiting for the man the take my order. Food is standard. But service is definitely below standard."}
{"text":"Une succursale Harvey's qui répond vraiment correctement à vos demandes. Vous y recevrez votre hamburer garni comme il se doit, comme vous l'avez demandé. Les gens qui y travaillent y mettent la passion et l'énergie nécessaires pour vous satisfaire. Enfin, une succursale où j'aime passer.

Finally, a good place to go when you want to have your burger YOUR WAY. No hassle, no repeating. To ask for it, you'll get it garnished to your likings. Staff is happy to prepare your order a reality with energy and passion. The place where I like to stop for my snack."}
{"text":"I have been quite a few Harvey's Restaurants in the Northeast GTA area.  Always the same same, usual usual.

This location though is the cleanest and most organized franchise location. The manager on the floor right at the cash taking orders and greeting customers. The staff in the front and the kitchen all working like a team.

There are also staff in the dine in area cleaning up the tables and making sure the self serve fountain drink area is never a mess.

This team spirit does makes the dining experience positive and which I enjoyed a lot as a franchise chain fast food place."}
{"text":"Harvey's burgers always been my favourite fast food burger whenever I have a burger craving and just want something cheap and quick.

This location is conveniently located just east of 404 on Major Mac. 

The staff here always been nice and cheerful. All my requests always been honoured with a smile. Pickles and pepper on the side please!

The interior though a little dim during nighttime as I could barely see what I was eating!

Good location if you want burgers and your friend wants Swiss Chalet as it is sharing the same storefront so you can order both and eat that in the Harvey's eat in area!"}
{"text":"Standard Harvey's burgers. We get take out here occasionally, service is fast and efficient. 
Keep an eye out for coupons in the mail. We get the coupons always every other week"}
{"text":"One of the best Harvey's that I've been to. Burgers are well made and the crew is quick and friendly. Pricing is slightly lower than other locations so you're getting a good deal. Wifi is available from the Swiss chalet next door. However, the lack of power outlets at a time when Starbucks, McDonalds, Tim Hortons, KFC and every other quick service chain is adding outlets to attract customers is striking. Otherwise would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"For fast food, they have the best veggieburger and what can I say, I like Pickles.  This is the only location in Pickering and Ajax that I am aware of and is near Westney and the 401.  Other than that, it is like any other location."}
{"text":"You get one star just by virtue of being affiliated/sharing space with the world's worst Swiss Chalet. Guilty by association."}
{"text":"This location has decent food. However. Very bad customer service. I ordered two burgers and my friend ordered one and a jr right behind me. He got his order first after 6-10mins. This was Sunday around 2pm, they were sort of busy. I go up and wait and I s
Asked about my burger this nice kid server wants to help and make my order, but their kitchen never made my order. They told the guy to search for a cheese burger combo that came 5-6 orders behind me and told the guy that that cheese burger order came of their system first.  I have the time stamp and everything. They  didn't even make my order. And when I got upset and anger they made my order. I feel really bad for the guy trying to help and my order, cuz he didn't do anything wrong. I talked to the manager and all she could do was like I know I'm sorry, I'll talk to them and I'll give u a refund if you feel like it after my meal. It's a matter of principle and I never accepted or wanted a refund. I MADE IT CLEAR AND NEVER GOT A REFUND. I feel that the manager really didn't know how to do her job and handle the situation and keep the restaurant in order. The kitchen is a mess if they didn't receive my order on their computer. Either their customers was to blame or their kitchen staff doesn't do their job. I was pretty upset. It's a chain restaurants they should have standards.... There are time stamps and minimum time requirements, McDonald's, a&w, and other fast food chains have then too. I'm sure Harvey's does too. This shouldn't happen. And apparently another customer approached me and said it happens often and they give u refunds as hush money. This really isn't right. 

Sadly I really enjoy eating at Harvey's I just will never set foot in this one ever again."}
