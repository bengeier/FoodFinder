{"text":"Well the hummus was good but that was about it. The Mediterranean salad with chicken was a disappointment. The chicken was over cooked and dry. I spent close to 13 bucks for a salad with dry Chicken and a two dollar bottle of water . Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I love this place! The salmon skewers are excellent. They come with warm pita bread and hummus, also a little salad and couscous. It's delicious! The place is clean, staff is very friendly. They have a small outdoor patio. Oh and they even have a couple of craft beers! Great addition to Town Square."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this great little place 4 instead of 5 stars is because they don't serve taboule, which is a personal must have for me. However, everything I tried was made to perfection. I had chicken skewers and kefta with a Mediterranean salad. My partner had a steak and salmon skewer plate, which came with veggie couscous, side salad, and hummus with warm pita bread. The meats are fantastic. I especially loved the chicken. It was very juicy and flavorful. The couscous also had a lot of wonderful flavors. 

I haven't had really great Greek cuisine since moving from southern Cali but this place hit the spot. I am very excited to have a go to Medi restaurant. 

There is no waiter service but there might as well have been because the girl who helped us was very friendly and sweet. I will definitely recommend this place to others and return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a solid healthy meal. One of the few places that actually fills me up...  The hummus is amazing with the fresh pita bread and the lamb/steak skewer plate never disappoints.  I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"If I could, I would eat this food every day. Fresh, delicious and healthy. Lamb and steak skewer plate is my favorite and is a ton of food and really fills me up. I absolutely love this place! Tons to choose from."}
{"text":"We ordered Crazy Pita for the office and it was amazing! We have about 20 members of the staff and every single person enjoyed it.  From the Chicken Skewers, to the Mediterranean Salad, to the Falafel and Mezza - it was great!  We'd definitely cater through them again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side IMO for what you get, but the value is in the taste. I had a salmon skewer with couscous and grilled veggies. For a couple bucks more it's a great alternative to fast food although getting the food took a little longer than I would have liked. Other than that an overall good experience."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a school event for our 10th grader, and based on the reviews we tried Crazy Pita. Take the time to figure out where it is -- if you just google maps it, you might struggle a little.

So the three of us had the steak skewers, the lamb skewers, and the falafel wrap. We also had a side of hummus. The food was very good. They have Coke products (fountain) which is a bonus.

The only complaint I have is that the pita bread that came out with the hummus was gooey inside. It might be the way they warm the bread up. Was it microwaved? Not sure. The bread tasted good, but the texture was a bit off.

As someone else noted, the hummus is on the silky side, not thick. It was yummy and I dont mind the thinness, but just FYI.

If we were in the area, we would go here again -- it was really good. 2 skewers, 1 wrap, 2 sodas, 1 small hummus = $40. Not bad for 3 people!"}
{"text":"Four stars bc the food was good. It tasted fresh and had great flavor. If the wait time had not been 25 minutes for 2 pitas i would have given 5 stars. 
They just opened in Downtown Summerlin,  hopefully they have a better grasp on how crazy busy they'll be and improve the service."}
{"text":"We have lamb pita, lean and grilled. Excellent customer service, the place is clean. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My kids love the chicken and steak on a stick.  The fries are awesome. The pita bread is fresh.  I like the shrimp skewer with hummus.  It is yummy."}
{"text":"Crazy pita used to be my go-to but seems to fall short now-in-days. I walked in to the location and was welcomed by a friendly gentleman at the front. I ordered a felafel pita with extra feta cheese. Mid-order the gentleman proceeded to interrupt me to talk to one of his associates, so I assume this might be where my order went wrong. I waited a few minutes for my food and was on my way. When I got to my car I decided to check on my order (and maybe sneak a few fries) When I opened the box I was surprised to see a chicken pita. Normally I wouldn't fuss over this because everyone makes mistakes, but I am vegetarian and have been for quite some time, so I walked back into the restaurant and politely told the cashier that I received a chicken pita when I had asked for a felafel pita. The gentlemen looked at me and said \"yeah you said chicken pita\" Which would make absolutely no sense since I, once again, am vegetarian and have been for quite some time. He different associate apologized for his remark. But I didn't appreciate being blamed for the mistake. I sat for another 5 minutes waiting for my food. I wasn't smart and figured they might take a little extra time to get the order right this time around but when I got home and checked my pita, they had forgotten to include my extra side of cheese :) I normally wouldn't stress over small details such as these. But hand in hand with poor costume service, it becomes a problem."}
{"text":"Parked in front of the restaurant at 8:39 pm, just in time for the employee inside to shut off the lights and lock the doors. No other hours were posted on the doors or windows."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fast. Terrific staff. Friendly owner pops in often. Clean. Love LOVE that chicken skewer and OMG the hummus is perfecto! Steak Skewer also ranks among the top Mediterranean foods I've had in Vegas. I'm hooked! 

A tad pricy but you get what you pay for and it's healthy,!

Thank you for the great food and service-oriented attitude!"}
{"text":"We had a good meal today at Crazy Pita, and in a nutshell I'd say it is a very solid choice for a \"fast casual\" Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant. The price, service, and food were all good.

We ordered a chicken pita, and a falafel pita with hummus as sides. The flame-grilled chicken in my pita had a yellow, savory sauce that had a mild almost curry-like flavor.

Neither the chicken nor the falafel were too spicy or \"garlicky,\" so I think most diners would be fine with it. I would say our food definitely fit into the \"mild\" category. If you crave really hot spicy food you might have to request them to dial up the spiciness.

The hummus was good. It had a very smooth texture, and a medium amount of garlic. I think most diners would be happy with it.

My only minor gripe, which keeps this from being a perfect experience is the pita they gave me to dip in my hummus were undercooked and doughy. I'm sure it was just the batch though, because the pita in my sandwich was just fine.

Overall a very good experience, and we would definitely eat here again. :)"}
{"text":"Wow, I should've checked on Yelp before going to Crazy Pita.. I didn't know they had salmon skewers!! Bummer.

Anyway, got some take out from Crazy Pita this weekend. I got the shrimp skewers. It came with one skewer full of shrimp.. I'd say about 6 peices. Also, came with cous cous topped with zucchini & butternut squash. It also came with a greek salad, which I didn't care too much for. It didn't have much lettuce, maybe two or three leaves and it was topped with some soggy feta cheese and cucumbers. Yuck.

We ordered a side of the artichoke hearts. I thought they were kind of chewy and not very flavorful. It seemed like it was just marinated artichoke hearts straight from the jar. 

Overall, Crazy Pita is ok. Nothing too special. I love Yanni's waaay better! They are a little pricey, but worth every penny! You get so much food. Too bad they were already closed."}
{"text":"The food was too salty and what we got in the falafel pita was not what was written in the menu . No humus and no roasted bell peppers. We know what Mediterranean food tastes like and this is not it."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at crazy pita, great food, great service, and lovely yet simple atmosphere. The servers were very friendly, specifically Haley which made me and my family feel like guest with full serves and a great attitude, absolutely recommend this place to anyone that's passing by."}
{"text":"One of my girlfriends suggested Crazy Pita when I said I was into Mediterranean food.  I met two of my girlfriends for lunch yesterday at The District location.

I had the chicken pita, which was grilled chicken with cucumbers, humus and red peppers, it was very good!  It was incredibly messy, it started to fall apart as I ate it.
It came with a side of fries, which were just okay.  They also have 3 different iced teas, I had the black tea.  There was also tropical and green tea.

I was impressed with the service, the waitress was friendly and attentive.  After we ate she came and asked to take our plates.  The staff was charming.  

I enjoyed the food which wasn't too pricy it was about $8.99 for my chicken pita.  Yep, I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I can't help but give this 5 stars.. I frequent Crazy Pita at least twice a week! Great location, nice outside eating or easy to grab and go. Food is seasoned to perfection.. Chicken skewer is amazing! OK, so is the steak. Can't go wrong with this place, and the quality of food at around $10 a plate is ridiculous.. fresh, fantastic and fast! Better than a fast food chain ANY day! If you can't enjoy this place for what it is, good food & price, better go back to McD's."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch and dinner, and love all the vegan options. The Crazy Pita salad and Mediterranean Salad are both great, and their hummus with whole wheat pita is delish. Crazy Pita is great!"}
{"text":"So happy this location opened close to home!  Same great flavors, same great service!

I've been stuck on the CHICKEN skewers but on our last visit we also tried the beef skewers - KEFTA. It''s a seasoned ground beef patty and pretty amazing.   This is a great place to eat if you are watching the carbs - skip the pita bread and go with a salad and skewers.  

I need to venture out and try the rotisserie chicken next time!"}
{"text":"I don't give the full Five Stars often but I really like this place! Located in Town Square near the Valet, stopped in for lunch with a couple of kids while school shopping. Love that it is healthy, flavorful, fast and friendly!

The kids meals are good size at the right price - my stepson got the chicken kabob and loved it. Kabob came with 5 chunks of meat and fries.  I ordered the steak kabob - it was seasoned and juicy over a bed of couscous. The pita was soft and warm with a smooth hummus. And it came with a fresh cucumber salad that had just right sprinkle of feta. 

The restaurant was clean and staff friendly and courteous - we hung out a little longer to catch part of the Little League World Series on their tv's.  Only other thing I can say is wish there was one in Summerlin so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  First time exploring downtown Summerlin. Found Crazy Pita - we will definitely be back!  Food was amazing. Service was good. Place was packed on a Saturday afternoon!"}
{"text":"Really really awesome, a wee bit pricey and sometimes the lamb is kinda fatty. But omg if you hate cucumbers like I do, you will still fall in love with their cucumber side salad. Their hummus is awesome and they are so friendly! Really, all of their food is amazing! LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Just had a great experience here. Fantastic customer service and unexpectedly good food as well (I had the the veggie pita with falafels). I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I was craving Panera but decided to check out he menu on this place bc I saw it had decent Yelp reviews. After seeing the menu I decided to eat here instead! I got the Kafta plate which was amazing!!! The portions were huge for a $10 meal I got meat, cous cous, veggies, an amazing cucumber feta salad, hummus, and tons of pita!! The flavors were pretty authentic, I would for sure come here again. I was also craving taziki sauce and expected to have to pay a lil for a side of it however it was FREE which was a for sure a highlight!! Yum. My tummy and wallet are happy. 

I almost forgot to mention to great and friendly service! I had a few questions about the menu and the girl taking our order was very sweet and had all the answers! They also come and clean your table for you which is a nice touch since you order at a counter."}
{"text":"Very good food. The chicken skewer was awesome. The chicken was very moist, and the BBQ char was perfect on it."}
{"text":"I've been a few times, and it's pretty good for the price of most things.  I mainly stick to the chicken, and it comes out in a timely manner.  I like the area it's located in to hang out, so it's a convenient spot to grab something to eat as well.  Just a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We went in to try their rotiserrie chicken.  It was delicious!  Hot, fresh and a very generous portion.  (These must be good sized chickens).  The cucumber salad was fresh and tasty.  I thought the service was very friendly and prompt for clean up, as well.  My only reason for not going for the 5 stars was their hummus.  It needs to be thicker and tastier with just the chick peas and the tahini.  Pita bread was served in easy to serve dipping pieces and piping hot.  We enjoyed sitting outside under the trees.  PS.  Loved the fact you can get Repulic of Tea (regular and tropical) out of the dispenser...and not having to pour out of a bottle.  My favorite tea."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lamb Chop salad for the fourth time in four days. I ordered them medium rare and they came out perfectly pink, juicy and delicious.  The salad of lettuce, grilled cauliflower, artichoke hearts, Kalamata olives , tomatoes, cucumbers and onions made it a very healthy dinner. 

The lamb chops are only available till the end of April."}
{"text":"I eat a vegan diet and Patrick at the front was really friendly and knowledgable about the options they could offer me. He even recommended which substitutions I could order. The falafel salad and the fries on the side were really good but it's people like Patrick that keep me coming back to restaurants!"}
{"text":"Found hair in food!! Chicken tasted like cleaning supplies. Overall very bland :( do NOT come here!! 


Two nights ago my wife and I decided to give that place a try. After reading the reviews on yelp we were excited to get some food there. 

We ordered the steak pita, half chicken and falafel with hummus on the side. Also a side order of zazikki. All togo. 

It took about 10min until the food was ready. 

When we got home we were super excited about the food. But it wasn't that great. Rather disappointing. The taste was very bland. A few bits in my wife found a HAIR in here pita. Disgusting. My first half of the rotisserie chicken was ok (didn't taste right off the grill) and the second one like cleaning supplies. Couldn't eat that anymore. 

Overall very disappointing!!! Not going back!"}
{"text":"We go there just about once a week.  I really think it is the best value in Las Vegas.  The food is always very consistent and the owner is behind the register 90% of the time.  He knows his customers and really cares about customer service.  
I see they are getting busier all the time.  The word must be getting out about how great this restaurant is."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is fresh anade to order.  Reasonably priced and food comes out in good time. The greek salad is amazing. Would highly recommend this place to anyone.

Parking can be a pain at times bc of the location."}
{"text":"Are you guys serious ? 30$ for food that tastes like a wanna be Greek restaurant. The first time i came here I gave it 5 stars, reason was the manager or whoever he was actually CARED and took the time to make sure the food was cooked and prepared correctly. 

This time was totally another experience. You guys need to hire a better night shift. They were rude, the food was tasteless and undercooked and when I walked in everyone was on Instagram on there phones? Smh. Whoever is the franchise manager I hoped realized he just lost customers. They messed up the order and dropped the chicken on the table all the while when the \"waiter\" brought the food over half of his hands were in the tray.

Gross.

If you want REAL Mediterranean food visit ZAYTOON. The best in Las Vegas , where they actually care about there customers and the quality of there food."}
{"text":"Tastes very good, and is also very fresh and light. Amazing service and the staff is so nice."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The owner is very personable and the food is delicious...the lentil soup is amazing!  

I have followed them from the District to Town Square and now Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Fast Friendly Fresh  all things you like when you are hungry . Had the lamb that was tender and tasty.enjoyed the salad and hummus.Very good pita bread ,the service was quick and the place was clean . Will return soon"}
{"text":"After arriving at Town Square and realizing NO restaurant let dogs in their outside dining patio we stumbled across Crazy Pita with starved stomachs and 2 dogs in tow. I decided to ask for the 5th time if we could eat in their patio with our 2 dogs and they said \"of course\" Yessssss, this was the place to eat (considering it was the only dog friendly place)

Food was really good but pretty expensive for what you get. We got a salad with 2 skewers and a steak pita with 1 large drink = $26 bucks!!! Oh well but they allowed my doggies to be with us while we ate. 

Nice, quick bite, dog friendly."}
{"text":"I love the taste of their pita bread.  Hot pita bread wedges with hummus are worth the trip alone.  The Pita sandwiches are the best in town. I love the kefta. The Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and ordered 2 chicken pitas and one childs chicken kabob. The food was good except everyone's fries were cold. I would give it 4 stars if the fries weren't cold. The pitas were 8.99 each -a little pricey and the drinks are extra. The service was good. I would go there again."}
{"text":"It was a first time try for me and my family to dine here yesterday. It was not bad at all. My husband got the 2 meat plate and I got a salad w/ chicken and a side fries for the kids. Our order took about 10-12mins which is not a long wait to get a fresh cooked food. Place was clean and warm. Service was great, all girls staff made this place different from other restaurant. One staff mentioned other locations and one is actually closer to where I live, summerlin. Will definitely come back to try other dish."}
{"text":"Amazingly clean place! Very congenial staff! Cheery ambience!

Food was a delightful surprise and wish we had this tasty little eatery back at home!!"}
{"text":"The staff at Crazy Pita is always so friendly and accommodating especially with our children and sometimes joint family dinners. We love the skewers and endless pita bread. 

We are pretty particular about what we look for with Mediterranean food and Crazy Pita delivers all of it. We are so amazed by how pleasant the staff is in addition to the great food!"}
{"text":"Had the steak pita and it was absolutely great. The sauce they put on it and the cucumber mixture was also really good. Everything seemed really fresh and cooked just as you ordered it. The only weird thing to me was getting a side of french fries that consisted of standard fries like you'd find at mcdonalds - but an order that was about half the size of a small. 
The atmosphere is really nice, being able to sit outside or inside. There are TV's with sports on inside, but the best part of sitting outside is your right down from a great BBQ place and makes the outdoors smell of it. You are also in the District which has a bunch of shops and misters going so even during the summer its not to bad for an after dinner stroll."}
{"text":"After volunteering for a special event at the Town Square Mall today, a friend and I went to check this place out. My friend is a vegan, and there were many options to choose from. Since we had never been there before, our server, CoCo, took time to explain all of the options, and even suggested we try sample items before we purchased them. CoCo really went the extra mile and \"wowed\" both of us by her honesty and sincerity. I chose the Chicken Pita and my friend got the Shrimp Skewer. Both were excellent!  Since we both live in Las Vegas, we really commended this restaurant on the level of service and congeniality that all of the employees displayed. I would give CoCo 10 stars on Yelp if it was possible!"}
{"text":"If you're tired of all the \"everyday\" food joints and want to step outside the box, this is the place to be. The food here is fresh and made on demand. With the larger portions you even have the choice of three different sides. Having killer food along with a very attentive staff and a variety of choices can be a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Wait time is ridiculous. There is no excuse to take 50 minutes to get a pita to a customer. We were not informed of any wait when we ordered. I watched the line extend out the door multiple times, then an employee would tell the people about the long wait and they would all leave. The place lost hundreds of dollars in revenue in the hour I was waiting there. Fries were ice cold."}
{"text":"Real fire grill, deep flavor, delicious marinades, variety of salads, meats, and sandwiches that taste delicious and are kid friendly. Restaurant is immaculate- so are the restrooms, and the staff is happy and upbeat. Reasonable prices seal the deal- it's a must try that will turn into a regular in your restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now.  Each time has been solid, good food.  I usually get the chicken pita and its excellent.  Juicy chicken, not dry, fresh veggies amd soft pita bread.  Id like a few more fries with my order, because I love fries..."}
{"text":"I thought I was going here too often because I was greeted by name. Then I realized that a healthy percentage of customers were greeted by name by both the owner and staff which speaks to both the quality of the restaurant and the loyalty of its customers. 
The salmon skewer is my current favorite. But it's seasonal as I was told they will only have it on the menu if it meets their quality standards. If the salmon isn't available, I rotate between the vegetarian pita, shrimp pita, shrimp skewer, or Caesar salad with shrimp. All are delicious options. While I don't eat meat, their carnivore options come highly recommended from everyone I've known to eat here.
It's a great place for a casual, quality meal and the outdoor dining is great if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint this place in on point! ;P My favorite is the veggie pita with fries. Very tasty. Super friendly and attentive staff. Clean and bright, too."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pita and was very pleased.  Clean friendly and comfortable atmosphere lead to an enjoyable dinner.  I recommend crazy pita to anyone that wants a quick bite to eat for cheap.  

One more thing... try the Casablanca lager."}
{"text":"The steak pita is delicious.  The meat is so tender and seasoned well.  It has a really great diced cucumber and tomato mixture with feta-MMMM yum.  It comes with fries which is kinda weird but they are good.  I also really like the Feta salad (super tasty dressing) and add a steak skewer.   The owner is almost always there and is very friendly too."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff that is competent and accommodating.
The food is always on point and I have yet to have a bad dish after 15+ visits.  Pita bread is fresh and warm and the restaurant itself is clean and well kept.
Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst dining experience I have ever encountered in my life, from the customer service, rude and unhelpful, rushed me to order, I had no idea what to order, it was my first time there. The food order came out not together, my husband got his food at least 10 minutes before me. His food was wrong. We told Hector the manager, he said he would fix it, in which he double changed my card, in which he didn't tell me about until after. In apologetic. It has been a week and the money still hasn't been refunded. So I decided to call, Jasmine answered the phone, I asked for a manager and she said she was. I told her the situation, in which she began to cut me off and yelling at me. She was completely unprofessional, and then found out she is just a supervisor. I've worked in customer service and hospitality for over 20 years and have never experienced such disrespect or been treated so rudely. I highly suggest eating some where else when in downtown summerlin , there are many more restaurants that treat people like guests and don't rush and scream at you."}
{"text":"Lamb shank on the weekends is like heavens rewards on earth. I come here on a regular basis. Love the place!"}
{"text":"Very nice place . Their skewers were amazing. We tried the salmon, shrimp and Chicken"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place, so I came for lunch with friends. The problem I have is the meal I ordered came out about 15 minutes after the meals of my friends, who placed their orders after mine. Sitting and watching everyone eat for 15 min made me a little grouchy, but did enjoy what I got:) The server apologized for the long wait, but I'm not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I went into Crazy Pita with my brother. He got the steak pita and I got the lamb pita. Both of us could agree that both of the meats were a bit overcooked. I also wished that they cut the meat into pieces instead of big cubes. That might help the long wait time for the food and lower the doneness of the meat. However, the fries were tasty and the combinations inside the pita were good. The lamb pita had cucumbers with hummus on it. The steak pita didn't have as great of a combination as it had olives. Each bite with an olive, I only tasted the olive and no longer the meat within the pita."}
{"text":"the food here is so delicious!! Everyone who works here is just as friendly as the owner. Easy take out, and a great place to stop and eat at."}
{"text":"Food here is an interesting take on Mediterranean standards. Servings come from the kitchen very slowly,  but the offerings are tasty.  It's not currently a place for a quick meal,  but the atmosphere is convivial and staff members are helpful. 
We three tried the grape leaves (dolmades), which came with a yogurt studded with what seemed to be a sort of pickle. The couscous, flavored with curry powder, and no fresh parsley,  arrived warmed with chunks of squash, orange and green,  and a side of pita. The soup looked hearty--it was vegetable- and beef-laden. Chicken pita also was among our choices,  and the chicken pieces were quite large.  Caesar salad is not something we'd recommend. 
Other notes: The pita is flat, sweet, and couldn't be split open. Pita chips are used for croutons in the salad. Fresh brew teas are available,  including a good green tea, and are expected to be drunk iced. 
Once the noon wait time for the kitchen to process orders is lessened,  we'll list this store as one to revisit."}
{"text":"Great spot in Downtown Summerlin for a healthy meal. Vegetable cous cous was flavorful and well seasoned. Also had the steak bowl with feta salad great choice for $8. I will be back"}
{"text":"Great meat, terrible value! The meat for the kebab skewer was amazing! The meat was tender and very flavorful. However for the amount you get, one not very big skewer with a tiny bit of vegetables and a scoop of hummus for $10.99 was way over-priced! I felt that the guy should have at least let me know that I could have ordered the Mixed Grill of any 2 skewers for $14.99 would have been a much better deal since there is nothing much to the plate except the skewer itself; but I found out about that choice too late. :/  Overall good food if you choose right, but don't go thinking you will get a good deal."}
{"text":"Lamb kabob is awesome!! I work in the mall @DR.VAPE 702 this is my new lunch/dinner spot"}
{"text":"DH wanted rotisserie and I'm a sucker for Mediterranean top it off with being in TownSquare we were sold on trying them for lunch. His dark meat chicken was moist and very flavorful. My steak skewer was perfectly  cooked and so tender. I was very impressed but not the same can be said for their eggplant dip. I expected the dip to be similar to baba ghanoush but it was more a bland watered down hummus. The couscous that accompanied my plate had a hint of cinnamon and cumin, a very nice mix. We will try this place again though he felt the chicken plate should come with couscous too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! 
I got the chicken and vegetarian pita. I liked the chicken pita more. Found it more flavorful.

Clean environment."}
{"text":"Went to the newest Crazy Pita at Downtown Summerlin today and had the worst lunch experience ever.  Stopped by at lunch time and waited in a short line.  I ordered a chicken pita and a small bottle of water for a little more than $12.00, which I thought was too expensive, but I wanted to try this place.  I was given a number and told a waitress would bring over my food when it was ready.  The place is small with a small outdoor patio area.  As all the tables inside were taken, I found a small table outside to wait for my lunch.  I waited for 55 minutes and still had not received my food, so I went inside to ask what was going on with my order.  I noticed lots of people standing around pondering the same thing.  When I went up to the counter to ask when I could expect my food, the woman next to me said  she waited about 50 minutes and received a pita that was inedible with cold fries that were so oversalted she could not eat them.  I asked what order number they were on and was told there were still 12 orders to be prepared before mine.  I lost my patience as I really didn't want to wait another hour to receive what was essentially a chicken sandwich and left.  I will never go back there.  The service is horrible, the prices too high, and, from  what I saw and heard of the food, it's definitely not worth a two hour wait."}
{"text":"Had falafel and chicken pitas here, and both were fantastic. If you love cucumber, you will LOVE the refreshing taste of the sauce - I am not a big fan of cucumber, but I still enjoyed it. It's perfect for hot summer lunch/dinner. The meat/falafel were well seasoned. Nothing was burned, nothing was too salty. They do sell alcohols (beers and wines). Its located near the yard house. Across from the street, there's a burger shop and parking lot. We used to drive all the way to green valley ranch for a good falafel, so we were happy to have found this place. The service was above average, restaurant cleanness is impeccable(well, it's bland new), and we will definitely return to try more. We wish this place survives at town square for a long time."}
{"text":"Am a fan! Lamb pita with large chunks of meat. Pay the extra 99 cents for a side other than fries,  it will be well worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots! You get a lot of food with the skewer plates and the pita is always well made. I've had all of the meat options and all are very good but I like the chicken best. However it is a little pricy... $30 for 2 meals, but you do get a lot of food! Chicken skewer, rice, cucumber salad and pita & hummus. 
If you like Mediterranean food and are looking for a place to get in and out pretty quick Crazy Pita is a great option!"}
{"text":"This place serves some of the best marinated chicken. Its always clean and if your in the mood for some healthy, tasty, and fast food. You definitely have to stop here. My favorite is the chicken marinated skewer. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean meals I've ever had! Hummus and falafel were on point! So good!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite here before heading to the movies.  Had the chicken skewer and steak skewer.  Both were great!  Comes with Pita,hummus,  A salad, and Couscous.  They also have one of those cool new Coke fountains that has an endless selection.  The deliver your food to your table and ask you how your doing after a few minutes.  Was a nice touch.  Walk past all the other overpriced restaurants in Town Square and heat for Crazy Pita!"}
{"text":"Morrocan - Mediterranean cuisine that is served fast, easy & fresh.  Whether you try Falafel,  Chicken, Kefta, or Salmon - all items are tastefully crafted to perfection. This place has \"feel-good food\" at an affordable price. Lunch or dinner, you'll never be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, so I had to try it out. food is good, takes a while to get it, which is a good thing - it's not pre-cooked. Server was friendly, food tasted good. I hope they can keep it up."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this but there were some things that were lacking to give Crazy Pita a higher rating. I went on 10/20 in the late afternoon the place had steady traffic but not packed. First, the service....was friendly and attentive. The server came to my table a couple of times to check up on my needs and always had a smile.  Next, the wait and price.....I order a falafel pita which cost 12.95 w/a drink it also came with a small order of fries but that's kinda on the high side in my opinion.  The order took about 15 mins to get which i thought was slow but based on previous reviews I guess is pretty fast for here.  The food.....was ok....not the worst but definitely not the best and I'm pretty easy to please. I would of liked a couple of sauce options which I have had at similar Mediterranean places (spicy green, tzatziki)  Considering the wait time, and price, I can only give 2 stars, If it were around $8 and I got my food in 2 mins, I could bump it up to a 3."}
{"text":"Customer service is very hit or miss here. Been here several times, today was a miss. Girl that took my order barely said one word to me (even after I tipped her, which was a mistake) not even a \"thank you.\" She failed to give me a drink cup and had to go to someone else and ask. She then proceed to talk to another employee about her tips. This is the fast food of the Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location a couple days ago. Very impressed. Quality of food is great. I had the mixed skewer plate with veggies and chicken and an extra order of hummus with pita for my friend and I. Jasmine was so friendly and went above and beyond to really make sure our entire experience was perfection. She checked on us a couple times to make sure we didn't need anything. She boxed up our hummus for us and even gave us an extra pita for the road. She was so sweet. We will definitely be back. Thanks Jasmine!"}
{"text":"Out for a nice walk through the new Downtown Summerlin and came upon this place. The price was right for our choice of meals. We had lamb and shrimp with a side of what they called feta salad. The salad was 99% cucumber with little to no olives and tomatoes in it. This is the same salad that they used for the pita and by the time you got to the middle it was soggy and falling apart.
Although the pita was good, I would have rather had it stuffed as opposed to a wrap. None of our meals came with tzatziki sauce you had to ask for it.
Honestly, I don't believe we will be going back for a meal there anytime soon as there are better places to choose from. However, you can judge for yourself it's a fairly new place and the service is great."}
{"text":"I had the Caesar salad today with shrimp and it was absolutely the best salad I've ever eaten!  It had the perfect amount of dressing, which tasted the best of any Caesar dressing and the shrimp were perfectly cooked, fresh, and seasoned to perfection.  The lettuce was fresh, crisp and just delightful!  I highly recommend this salad and Crazy Pita!"}
{"text":"Great service, very fresh food, owner is nice and always gives my daughter a free drink"}
{"text":"Highly recommended!!! Service is great and the supervisor (can't think of her name) is very professional who knows her job well. Went there already 5 times since the day they're  open and will be visiting often. Food is good and fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always excellent. Fun and hip atmosphere and there are some cute guy staffers  to look at as well and for me good looking guys and fantastic food will always bring me back."}
{"text":"This is by far my FAVORITE place to eat. I love the food, everything is soooooooooooo good!! I love love love the ceasar salad, I got it as just a side, but it turned out to be soo good. The qaurter chicken and the kabobs are DELICIOUS. I can never decide what to get becaue everything is soooo good. The fries are even good! I dont even like pita and hummus, but i love it their for some reason. I recommend everything and the customer service is the best. 
I was new to this kind of food, but the owner helped me pick out exactly what he thought id like, and he was right! He didnt even charge me extra for making my meal completely different then what it said it came with. I love this place.
I moved back to CA and I still crave this place...please open one in orange county! lol"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at this location. My husband is a picky eater his usual is a burger or sandwich, I figured he wouldn't find anything to eat. We both ordered the chicken pita and we made the right choice. The food was amazing we'll be back to this location. The staff was friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"I tried crazy pita for the first time today. 

First impression: very clean and a good amount of variety on the menu.

I ordered the chicken pita to go. It took a while for me to get my chicken pita but it was definitely worth the wait.  When I opened the box, my first thought was, \"this is massive, how am I supposed to eat this?\"  The pita was so stuffed that I had to eat it with a fork, this is definitely not a bad thing lol. The pita was so flavorful and the chopped cucumbers was a good addition, I never had a pita that was made the way crazy pita does it.  For 7.95 you get fries and a huge pita...definitely worth it! 

I look forward to coming back her again and trying other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"31 May 2014, 12:45p

I was checking out the Town Center mall and decided to stop here for lunch based on the reviews.  The restaurant was very bright and airy and the employees were very friendly.  After taking a quick peek at the menu, I decided on:

Mixed Grill of Lamb Skewer and Falafel

While sitting at my table waiting for my food, one of the employees brought over plastic utensils and napkins.  I also noticed they have free wi-fi.  Shortly thereafter, my food arrived and looked fantastic.  The food runner asked if I wanted to try a harissa sauce and brought a small container when I said yes.

The food looked very good and I was pretty hungry so I dove right in.  Hummus is one of my favorite things and the pitas accompanying my meal were very fresh. Unfortunately the hummus was a little too smooth for me.  I know that hummus varies and the flavor was very good, but I like a little more consistency.  I'm sure others will prefer it this way and I'm in no way knocking the restaurant for it, just airing my preferences.

The salad was also very fresh and flavorful.  I like that the cucumbers were diced allowing them to pile more onto the plate.  The lamb was a bit tough and not very flavorful, but the harissa added a nice kick.  Contrary to some of the other reviews I skimmed over, I thought the falafels were very tasty.  I also liked the roasted vegetables laid over the cous cous to support the skewer and the falafels.  The cous cous itself was very fine, to which I'm not really accustomed.  It also was very light, so it had a tendency to fly all over the place when I was cutting my lamb.

Overall, I enjoyed the meal and the portions are very generous.  I'd definitely return and try a pita next time if I'm not as hungry.  The food was good, the employees are very friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to eat with co-workers and brainstorm ideas. This is the perfect place they have great food! The pita are phenomenal. The cuscus was blain. Not tasty at all. But the lamb skewer is a most have."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Henderson. Always such a friendly, clean and brightly lit restaurant. Perfect lunch place. I've eaten here numerous times throughout the years and I've never had a bad meal. Always outstanding and delicious food. Any of the skewer plates are highly recommended. The lamb shank plate is a must on Saturdays when it's available. The steamed veggie couscous is amazing. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like the food , but hate the way the cashier tells you that the tip is on the 
Credit card machine you sign. I think it's rude to ask for a tip and I know how to sign for my credit-card."}
{"text":"Tonight we wanted to eat somewhere different.
(We eat out ALLOT) and we're tired of the same thing.

So we saw the crazy pita. 

The service and the taste of the food was good and was the atmosphere.  

The only reason I am giving it a 3 is because i was expecting a pita pocket type sandwich.
After researching it . It can go both ways.

And I wish they had a build your own."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in town.  We tried ordering through Postmates a large order for our dental office on a Sunday.  There was an error and Postmates cancelled the order.  I called and talked to them they said they would deliver to us themselves.  We are downtown and they  are not the closest to us but were willing to deliver.  Then because of postmates cancelling the food it was going to be later than we thought not because of Crazy Pita fault so I had to change the order because some of the staff was leaving and they were so nice cancelled half the order and still delivered.  Not only is the food great the customer service there is outstanding being in the customer service industry myself I know it is hard in Las Vegas to find businesses that have great customer service.  Whenever I am in Town Square this will be my go to place to eat."}
{"text":"The food is fresh (it's pipping hot when you get it), healthy, and delicious.  I highly recommend the Vegetable Skewer Plate and the pita (of course!) with hummus.  If you dine in, the service is also fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting some good Greek food in henderson for a while now, and this place did not disappoint.  Pita was fresh and soft, falafal was fantastic!  Could have done without the lack of cherriness in the girl helping me, but I will go back for sure.  

I have had a good amount of Greek food and this really compares.  It is hard to have falafal that doesn't taste bland and isn't dry.  Come here and you will not regret the move."}
{"text":"Owner took time to explain food allergens in our order with confidence!  Overall, excellent!  Pita is fresh, hummus Rocks, and lamb is tender full of flavor.  Healthy choice.  Thanks, see you next year for baseball tourny.   Hope one is developed in San Diego!"}
{"text":"It was ok not a huge variety for gf food. I'm celiac so hard to find places with lots of options was surprised they didn't even have gf pita bread nor did the employed really understand what a gf allergy is. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food, outstanding service and always a good vibe inside. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I can't wait until they open their Town Square location!  But until then, Henderson will have to be the place to go!  This place is awesome!  The food is made fresh and the menu is simple but yet all delicious!

I had the lamb pita and it was delsih!   There isn't anything negative about the place and I would definitely suggest everyone try this place once and will fall in love!"}
{"text":"Crazy Pita the food is great, I love the Mediterranean salad. I was the instructor  for a paint and party, which was very successful. that's how i learn about this place, very cool."}
{"text":"Excellent! My husband and I tried Crazy Pita for the first time today. We both ordered falafel pitas and LOVED them. We had given up on Jerusalem Grill awhile ago do to extremely poor and rude service and food had gotten pretty bad. We both liked the hummus and pita side. Everything was fresh and service was friendly and fast. We agreed the falafel was \"almost\" as good as Moshiko, which it the best falafel restaurant in Jerusalem. We will definitely be going back to try the chicken skewers which looked delicious."}
{"text":"I've been on a huge Mediterranean kick lately and I love this lunch spot. 

The staff is always friendly and accommodating. I really like that, even after the order has been placed and I've received my food, the staff comes by to check and make sure everything is good. It's a nice touch for a 'fast food' type restaurant. 

I generally order the chicken pita. It is marinated then rotisserie'd chicken covered in also marinated tomatoes, cucumbers and olives. On top of that - dressed lettuce, and feta cheese. The pita it is served in is soft and delicious and it comes with a side of French fries. I also like that this location has one of those new Coca Cola Freestyle Machines. Vanilla Diet Dr. Pepper rocks my world in a super serious way! 

This place is always clean and there is plenty of seating inside and outside on their patio. I'm a regular here and I highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We often come here for lunch and are never disappointed. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food is served fairly quickly and is fresh and delicious.
It is a bit loud when busy but we don't really come here for the atmosphere. There is outside seating if preferred and plenty of shopping opportunities all around. A great place for a quick, pretty healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! This was my first time here I tried the falafel rice bowl which comes with dolmades, saffron rice, hummus, pita chips, and falafel. The falafel were perfectly flavored not too salty like I've experienced other places. The hummus was smooth and creamy and perfect for the warm pita served with it. The place was clean and staff was very friendly and attentive. 
Would definitely recommend for anyone that wants fast Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night and was a little disappointed.  Being from a Mediterranean background the food really didn't quite do it for me.  They offered the typical meals, however the touch they added just fell short.  I had the chicken kabob skewer which came with a small salad, humus and couscous which wasn't bad.  The only thing that was on point was the service.  The waiter brought my food out fairly quickly and was very courteous.  He cleared our table and plates within minutes of us finishing.  Overall I probably wouldn't go back for the food but I may go and try something else just for the service."}
{"text":"One of my favorites for awhile! The service is always really good and the food is great. It's not super traditional but the hummus and AMAZING couscous make up for t. I suggest the skewer plate! They even have a veggie skewer for me"}
{"text":"My first time here and I have to say I was very impressed. It was very clean and the staff was top notched and very friendly. 

I ordered the lamb pita and it was very tasty. The only thing I did not care for was the huge chunks of lamb. I think it was too big and you would get a huge piece of lamb the nothing for a couple of bites. It's a good thing the sauce was so good. But really that will not stop me from getting it again. And I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!!!  One of my favorite places to eat!  Their food is always fresh and delicious. You cannot beat their french fries.  I also love that we can casually eat outside and have a glass of wine if we like.  The baklava is also outrageous!  Very friendly staff and clean establishment."}
{"text":"So I just had a Great Chicken Pita Sandwich experience today. Walked in the door at 12:30 PM and Bryan greeted us with a courteous smile. We initially ordered to go and then decided to stay and eat in. The service was Great & the food was really good.. See my picture! If you're visiting Downtown Summerlin and you like Pita Sandwiches, you won't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The steak pita is delicious!!!! Love the hummus and went for the salad this time! Delish"}
{"text":"Simple grilled proteins and good salads make for a healthy, quick and compelling meal.  Lots of feta, olives and other Mediterranean flavors make their way through most of the food. I must say the decor is pretty horrible and colors of the space makes the dining experience kinda crappy... but the food and service are always good!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some mediterranean food, so I hit up the Crazy Pita for the first time. I was appreciative of the courteousness & professionalism of the staff. I ordered a half rotisserie chicken with sides. I was hungry and it hit the spot! Everything was well prepared & delicious. The warm pita bread & hummus was bangin'"}
{"text":"Just love the crazy pita. Whenever I ask my family where do they want to eat, crazy pita is always one of the top three choices. I have never had a problem with customer service even when they are busy. For everyone who has written a semi negative or absolutely negative review just go to another franchise / chain restaurant and you can eat there microwaved food and get great customer service. I am happy that an independent family owned restaurant opened up in downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Flavorful healthier options. The hummus and pita bread is delicious. Service is always great!"}
{"text":"I never get tired of eating here and have been doing so since they originally opened on Horizon and Valley Verde. Healthy, tasty & fresh food, friendly staff, you cannot get any better than that. My favorite is the chicken kabob plate, and to make it healthier I usually just ask to sub. salad for the cous cous. Although I don't indulge in them often, their fries are delish and they have the best eggplant dip I've ever had. Another bonus: plenty of outdoor seating for when the weather is nice. If you like mediterranean-oriented food and you haven't tried this place you need to go! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch on Sunday. Very bright and pleasant ambiance.
You order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. 
Hubby tried Joshi's pita served with a ground beef patty, very juicy and flavorful. I had the falafel pita, the falafel was so crispy and fresh, loved the perfectly diced cucumbers and hummus served with the wrap. Both dishes came with their crispy thin fries. 
My son tired the beef on stick from kids menu, he finished everything on his plate! Kids meal comes with a drink, fries and pita.
Staff is very friendly and efficient. They had some nice looking Mediterranean desserts which I plan to try next time :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times... Food is pretty consistent and service is actually really fast and friendly! Don't expect top class Mediterranean or Greek food. It's typical Greek mall food. Nothing spectacular but nothing awful. 
As a side note I don't recommend the fries or rice. Both are dry and bland. Okay for a quick lunch on the run, just don't expect anything earth shattering :)"}
{"text":"Awesome. Paymons isn't nearby, so Crazy Pita is really nice to have near. The chicken is awesome! The falafel is actually more flavorful than Paymon's current recipe which is bland. This is also a different kind of restaurant. It is more fast food than actual dining. I love it!"}
{"text":"Not at all what I was expecting. So many raves about the food. Portions on chicken screws small compared to The Great Greek. Hummus was like soup and tasteless. Not on my radar any longer. Was especially disappointed that for 10.99 I could have had a full meal with hummus and Greek salad when I said I was new customer to their menu. Instead I paid 12.00 for side of hummus,pita and single chicken screwer.  Sales person should at least offer up as I am a senior and every penny counts."}
{"text":"Can't tell you how much I love this place. My family eats here or orders out a least once a week. Everything is good. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The Pita sandwich with Shrimp has become my favorited!! Service is spectacular! !"}
{"text":"This place was pretty fresh and tasty..I was surprised!  The guy at the front counter that took our order was a little weird, but I think he meant to be nice.  I had a chicken pita with cucumber salad, both were delicious! The chicken was cooked perfectly, pretty close to how I like to cook chicken at home.  I had two bakalava rolls for dessert, and they were just ok."}
{"text":"That was yummy! Came here with my family and we all enjoyed it. I got the kafta beef and everyone else got the beef skewers- meat was flavorful and juicy, cooked to perfection! A great deal at $10 a plate and it was the perfect amount of food. Everyone working there was very nice and attentive! We will definitely be back especially since we live closeby!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a quick bite to go. We ended up ordering a large fries and regular falafel and hummus. We were the only ones in there and it took about 8 minutes to get our food. The large fries were 6$ served in a styrofoam container. Maybe we should have ate the fries there because by the time we got them they were soggy and weird. The resembled McDonald's fries - very skinny and long, but were flavorless and kind of dry. My friend paid 5$ for a regular falafel / hummus and it was served in a tiny cup. She also asked for a side of ranch and didn't receive. The pita bread to hummus ratio made no sense, there was sooo much pita bread left over for the dollop of hummus they gave. Only plus was the cashier was super nice."}
{"text":"Just yesterday around 5 pm, I ordered a 1/4 chicken dark meat and it was old and overcooked and very small for $8!  The chicken skewers were also over cooked. I've been here before and their food was delicious. Last few times their chicken has been overcooked - more than likely will not be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here before our flight home from Vegas.  I had a chicken pita and hubs had a falafel pita.  They were tasty and filling (and they came with fries - yum).  We found them kinda hard to eat, but we figured it out!

The weirdest part was the really sickly looking pigeons that kept trying to steel crumbs from the ground.  What was up with them?  Their feathers were greasy and falling out, poor things (too many fries?). 

If I lived around here, I'd go back.  It wasn't the greatest thing I've ever had, but for a quick inexpensive lunch it was really good."}
{"text":"A surprisingly good dinner! I've been to a Crazy Pita before but this was different. I felt like we were in a fancy restaurant when the guy gave us our plastic knife and fork on a folded napkin as we sat at our table waiting for our food. Later, as we ate, he came by to ask how everything was. Just once so it was non intrusive. Food - the grilled chicken and shrimp was moist and was good. The pita bread so warm and soft, I put aside my less carb diet and ate almost all of it, same with the rice.The place is so clean, not the usual slightly sticky or slightly greasy tabletops and chairs. Watched the on going March madness on TV while music played overhead. Nice ambiance. There was a little area for outside patio seating."}
{"text":"Delicious! My friend bought a Be Kind shirt too. I had the braised lamb pita & she had the steak pita they were delicious! First time trying it so I was really impressed."}
{"text":"This place is really really good!  Aside from having incredibly high-quality ingredients, and perfectly cook meats, the service was superb. In Vegas you get accustomed to being treated like garbage by service workers (if you are off the strip).  However, at this place the servers treated us like real people. It was refreshing."}
{"text":"This is a late post but we were here a few days ago. The food was very good, the service was excellent. We will back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Came here for some quick eats, was instantly blown away  at how amazing the service was and how delicious the food was. I recommend trying EVERYTHING. Their sauces are so delicious. I see no reason to eat anywhere else in DTSumm, this place has my vote for number 1!"}
{"text":"Decent quality fast-food-esque option at the Downtown Summerlin mall. Pita sandwiches, kabob plates, and a variety of sides round out the menu, along with some kid options.

Lamb kabobs are tasty, steak pita is a great combination of flavors. The vegetable couscous was interesting and higher-quality than I expected, but the pita seemed pre-made storebought. Dolmas didn't do it for me, but the tzatziki sauce they were served with was unright sour.

Many reviews state service was incredibly slow when they first opened, and per an Eater article they have tripled their staff. Wait on a weekday afternoon was just shy of $15 with six employees standing around and no one in line ahead of me. If your employees are trained to be efficient, you don't need as many. That being said, the ones I encountered were polite but there was a lot of standing around going on."}
{"text":"Been a repeat visitor and have enjoyed my meals here.

Tend to stick to our usual order of shrimp pita and/or Mixed Skewer Plate (steak & shrimp) which comes with hummus, pita, salad, and vegetable cous cous.  Fairly healthy meal. Steak can be overdone and dry at times.

Staff is friendly (a wee bit attentive at times if the restaurant isn't busy). Place is very clean and bright. 

Tend to come here if I find a coupon in the zip code mailer.

I'd recommend this place if you're in town square and looking for a healthy meal with fairly short wait time."}
{"text":"Trust me, Crazy Pita is totally worth a try if you haven't already.

I'd choose Crazy Pita any day over typical kebab joints, including higher-end ones.

It's not a fancy restaurant, a fast food like place so to speak, but it's what's inside that counts - if the food is all that matters to you, this might be the place you come to love in Town Square.

The lamb / beef skewers are tasty, and the shrimp pita is a bomb! It may not look great on a photo, but it tastes really good."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Had the steak wrap with feta salad mix inside with a chicken bowl, very nice! Friendly service and good food!"}
{"text":"The food here is healthy, delicious and consistently good. The staff is friendly and helpful, always smiling and one of the reasons I keep coming back, besides the wonderful food. They have a very diverse menu which caters to all tastes including vegetarians. Tori is one of my favorite servers, she's always smiling and very helpful and friendly. My favorite meal is, wait I have so many, they're all wonderful. Let me list a few of my favorites, lamb skewer plate, steak skewer plate and the lamb shank special which is usually a Friday special. The vegetables are cooked perfectly and usually are zucchini and butternut with couscous. The steak is done to the perfect temperature and is tender and juicy. Everything is tasty and well made. The plates come with a side of Greek salad, hummus with pita, couscous and veggies with the skewer of your choice. By the way, once you eat the hummus here, you will never want hummus from anywhere else, it's AMAZING. Oh, for those that like good soda choices, this is your place, they have the great Coke machine that allows you to choose and personalize your drinks, the choices are plentiful. Try this place, you'll not regret it:)"}
{"text":"Good food. Ran into mark hardest working person I have ran into in a long time. This dude is nonstop need more hard workers like Mark"}
{"text":"When I walked in I immediately noticed how clean the place was, paid for my meal, was given a number and sat at a very clean table. After being seated the server brought my meal to my table, and was very polite and formal. Also kept constant track of what I needed, more Pita bread, or anything else I needed, the man was on top of it. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because the food just wasn't what I was used to. Being Arab, this was definitely a westernized Mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place I really did. I had to go three times because every time they were out of Lamb meat. I am thinking it must be amazingly good if they keep running out right? So I go and order lamb meat gyro. I was expecting a meat loaded sandwich like the kind you get at every other authentic Greek place. I was sadly mistaken. Instead of the usual thin sliced seasoned lamb meat budging out of the sandwich I got mostly filler and a few cube cut pieces of undercooked red in the middle pieces of no taste meat. Yuck I wont be back. My advice go to a real Greek restaurant and pay the same for a much better experience."}
{"text":"Been here once with the whole family and twice with the wifey. The food is excellent and the staff is very nice. They tend to be busy at lunch which is to be expected because their are a lot of businesses in the area. The Hummus and pita's are so good and the salads are great too, The cool thing about this place is they have a paper menu with all the nutritional information listed. I'm on a low sodium diet so it's really nice to see what the sodium content for each meal is. I wish every restaurant did that. This is one of our go to places to eat."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stumbled across the Crazy Pita after shopping around Town Square. I ordered the 1/4 white Rotisserie chicken with a side of falafel. I'm allergic to gluten and dairy but that didn't phase the awesome staff! They were so accommodating and I waited excitedly for my food to be prepared. It only took a few minutes and I thought it was gonna be good but OMG! Seriously some of the best chicken ever! The marinade is to die for, wonderfully lemony and the chicken was so juicy. The falafel was the best I ever had. So glad we stopped by! Sad because I don't have one of these by my house!"}
{"text":"Why do they try to force you to tip before they have even served you? I ALWAYS tip, but I'm not psychic so how am I supposed to know that you aren't going to mess up my meal."}
{"text":"I order a child portion because that's all I eat. If i ordered the items in the kids meal ala cart, It would be over $11, and the only difference is a larger portion of fries, which I don't want. I also don't want an extra 300 calories or $5 worth of rice and salad that I wont eat anyway that you get when you order the plate. They told me only kids can get drinks with the kids meal. What kind of shit is this. I am not given a discount for not getting a soda, and I take it to go so I'm not drinking 45 ounces of soda.  Why can't I get what I pay for? I was eating here once a week for lunch, but that's done."}
{"text":"Needed something quick and not too heavy so I could focus on finishing a project for school, so my husband called ahead and it was ready and waiting when I arrived.  Easy parking since they have several 15 minutes pick-up spots designated for Crazy Pita.  Yeah!

We had a veggie skewer with red pepper, red onion, egg plant, and tomato, and we also ordered a shrimp skewer and falafel with hummus (they were served with roasted peppers which made my husband so very, very happy).  The skewer came with hummus, feta salad, and veggie couscous.  There were beautiful chunks of butternut squash with the couscous and they ended up being my favorite!

I love that they don't over salt their food.  It was grilled beautifully, the hummus was creamy, and the feta salad was crisp and cold.  Nicely done!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience in every respect: food is very good, well spiced, nice variety, fresh & tasty; the restaurant is clean & well lit, comfortable; the staff was exceptional! Attentive but not bothersome. I had the lamb skewer plate, instead of cous cous they offered vegetables. Everything was great. The lamb was cooked perfectly, tender & well spiced. The salad was very nice, just the right amount of dressing. The hummus was good, served with warm pita bread & the vegetables were assorted squash with spices...delicious! A very nice young man offered tzatziki and house made hot sauce...a real treat!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken kabob meal, and it was yummy. The chicken was perfectly seasoned. The staff was very friendly. There was a little bigger than mine, but it was lunchtime so it was  understandable. Overall, yummy relatively healthy food and great staff."}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill since opening. No flavor in any of the dishes. Little to no help with healthier options If you want veggies instead of fries wasn't even an option? Wont be back again"}
{"text":"Food was great but very disappointed with the staff!! The host walked and talked and served everyone but me?? She offered extra pitta bread and to go boxes and never once came my way? I had lunch by my self which I do often and I really felt some type of way that I didn't get same treatment as the other customers..... next time I'll do take out"}
{"text":"This is an excellent spot for a quick and inexpensive meal while shopping in town square. 

I ordered the chicken pita which was great! The marinated chicken was full of flavor, and wrapped up with hummus, red peppers, diced cucumbers, and lettuce- and served with a side of fries. For being at a high end shopping area, I was happy to find this little gem. The skewers looked really good also and would probably be the next option I try."}
{"text":"Nothing had any flavor -

That sums up this experience and it was expensive for what it was. For $30 we had lamb & chicken gyros with a cream soda & bottled water. 

The lamb wasn't tender & lacked any type of Mediterranean seasoning. The chicken was better but wasn't moist. Everything was one noted & really boring. We left regretting trying it & wanted something else.

The restaurant is very nice & clean and no issues with service, just really bland food for our taste buds. 

With so many great pita/gyro places in town you can get much more flavorful food that's also cheaper."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for lunch in the District.  I've passed this place many times and it was finally time to try it.  

Service here was good.  They were very friendly and accommodating.  Orders were taken quickly and food was prepared efficiently.  The dining area is clean and open.  

I ordered the lamb pita with fries.  The pita is topped with tomato, cucumber and romaine.  If you want tzatziki for the pita they will put it on the side.  In my mind I was expecting the lamb to be shaved and not chunks.  The lamb was good but the chunks were a little too big.  I'm also not a huge cucumber fan and there was too much of that inside.  The fries were just ok but nothing special.  

My friends skewer plate looked amazing and he definitely liked it.  I would return to try that out."}
{"text":"This place is great! So many tasty options and healthy choices. I work in the mall and need a quick snack sometimes so I get the pita and hummus most of the time and it's a great huge serving. I usually have a lot of leftover hummus and will have it with chips from home later. I've gotten the chicken pita many times and recently tried the shrimp pita, both are great! The staff and owner are very friendly and treat you like a restaurant customer instead of just a quick service place that wants you to leave and make room for the next customer. If you're looking to have a quick cheaper meal in Town Square, go here."}
{"text":"Food is always good. My toddler is pretty picky and he always eats very well here. The cashier is always nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I decided to come here because my business partner frequents this place often.  The restaurant is located in Town square around the corner from Guitar Center, next to the AMC movie theatre.

The good news is that the place is pretty healthy so I will be back since its so close to my work.  But as far as mediterranean places go, its pretty standard fair.  

I had the chicken pita as well as the chicken kabob plate.  Both were solid but not phenomenal.  There's a touch of curry in the chicken kabob and it sits on a bed of tiny quinoa (not sure if its quinoa but same consistency).  Also comes with small side salad and pita bread.

It does get a little crazy around lunch so be prepared for a little hectic-ness when waiting in line..they only have one register.  The service is pretty solid as you can tell the wait staff really cares about making sure the customers are happy."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4 times since the mall construction. I was impressed by the Decor, and service, but that's about it.

I was first invited in, when working the Macy's soft opening... Everything was really good. However, I was very surprised at how much I payed.

I went in a week later, and apparently they were only open for construction workers, but the rest of us had to wait outside, then being told our food was delivered to the store. By the time we walked back, my friend didn't have time to eat, and I had to search for my food. To find out it was sent back... I then had to wait another 30 mins for delivery.

The next time I went in alone, everything was good. However, I payed dinner prices for lunch.

Then went there once again with my wife... We could've driven to Twain & Durango to get better quality food, and would've paid half. 

Although the place is nice looking, and the soda machine has many options, I hope they can work on the prices... $12.00- $15.00 per person is ridiculous for what you get! 

I can't wait until more places open!"}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean food.  Fast, reasonably priced and pretty health.  Worth going to."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! The food was on point. Lamb and chicken kabob w couscous and hummus was extra tasty. Pitas were hot and soft. Staff was extra friendly. Pricing was great. Since it isn't on the strip it was nice to not be too packed but definitely in a great place with other shops"}
{"text":"I was on the fence about giving this place 4 or 5 stars. But the very friendly staff persuaded my rating to inch up to the five stars. Not to say that the food isn't good. It's definitely one of the better Greek / Mediterranean type restaurants. The steak pitta I had was very fresh and tasty. Definitely worth the money. Very good food coupled with a very friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"This place is your typical fast food mediterranean type of place but better.  Ive had the chicken (gyro and kabob)  as well as the shirk, both were wonderfully seasoned without being salty.  They have yummy baklava as well (they have the square regular kind a well as the ones that are rolled up (those have a different name but I can't remember) 
The service is also really quick, about 5 to 10 minutes.  
(please ignore all of the posts about the wait being 45 min, or at least take into consideration that it was the grand opening of the summerlin mall and there were only 2 other restaurants open) 
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food so I was excited to come here. But sadly this place overall is pretty average.

I'm not a huge fan of their food. The vegetable couscous (rice looking thing) isn't good at all. I wish they gave us an option to have actual rice instead of the couscous. They give a lot of pita bread compared to other places, which is good. I think they are very pricey for the amount of food they give. I can only somewhat justify the price because it's conveniently located at Downtown Summerlin mall.The chicken skewer is always slightly charred but still pretty good. The salad is way too plain. The steak here is exceptional.

What I do like is the attentive service. There's always someone watching the tables in case we needed something. They would always give us containers of sauce if we wanted some more.

I wouldn't come back to get Mediterranean food when there are lots of other places that provide much cheaper and delicious food."}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is absolutely phenomenal!!! I'm not sure which is more outstanding, the staff or the food?!?! Both are fantastic!"}
{"text":"What a great find.  Even though my order was messed up, the team took it back and fixed it perfect.  If you love lamb and they have the lamb shank, get it.  It was very tasty falls off the bone.  Great lunch.  Thanks.."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious!!! I've had the chicken salad and chicken pita. They're bomb. The have the best hummus too! I love the food here. It's inside Downtown Summerlin. Everyone here is friendly. I've been here several times since they opened and each time the food and service is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone I know. It's a nice and casual restaurant"}
{"text":"Showed up with 8 of us (5 kids). They helped get our space together. Very helpful. Food was high quality and tasty. Had a great time. Kids eat it all up!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Food is fresh and delicious. Food was served hot and quickly. Grilled shrimp is one of my favorites. Hummus is made there. Really tasty! Soda machine was down - bottled iced tea is a little pricey at about five dollars a bottle, but still a great spot and overall reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Minutes from closing and the lady with a pony tail in the counter was very very nice. Good food and great service . Thank you!"}
{"text":"We had the falafel sandwich with fries. It wasn't anything special. I have had much better. I have had the veggie sandwich too and probably wouldn't order it again. A little overpriced for what you get. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Normally I have mixed emotions when I come here. The food is good but service is subpar. Nonetheless my experience today was overwhelmingly joyful. Mark and Marshall made it a very happy experience for myself and family. They were very attentive and cool. It definitely redeemed my opinion and I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is essentially the panda express of Mediterranean food. Lacking flavor, spices, etc. The price is a bit high, I paid almost $15 for a lamb combo plate and a drink.

Is rather go to chipotle"}
{"text":"Chicken kabob had a rubbery texture so it was either frozen chicken that wasn't sealed right or poor quality chicken"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time yesterday and we will be back.  We had our little pomeranian with us and they accommodated us on the outside patio.  We both had the chicken pita and loved the quality and cooking of the chicken breast in addition to the refreshing cucumbers inside the pita.  The hummus was great.....I would love it if they heated up the pita chips to accompany the hummus to make it even more scrumptious.  That is just me though!!  It was great and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars cuz the staff are super friendly and accommodating, very good customer service here and food is yummy!"}
{"text":"I visited this location and restaurant for the first time on 9/2, and it was a great experience. The Chicken Pita with Fresh Vegetables and Fries were all made fresh and very very good. I liked the bottled cream soda I got as well. I will definitely return for another visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I'm in town from Utah I stop in. Not only does the food taste amazing and fresh, but the service is on point as well. They are so nice and offer extra humus and pitas to me every time! Love it!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for a long time and NEVER had a food issue until tonight. It was a carry out order so until I got home I did not realize that my meats were really over cooked. I called it in and was astonished at how far and beyond they went to fix the issue. This place is the best, and my family will continue to eat here multiple times a month!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the customer service is always outstanding, this staff is so attentive and go out of their way to make customers feel at home! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Still thinking about the chicken kabob since Halloween night!  I was craving it so much I tried another mediterranean place and was sadly disappointed.  Can't wait to try more stuff on the menu but it will be hard not to get the chicken kabob every time!"}
{"text":"Crazy Pita's . . . well, not bad.  That's the best I can give it . . .Not bad.  

The restaurant offers healthier fast food with a Mediterranean theme, but with surprisingly little flavor.  The lamb was cooked well and kept relatively tender, but under-seasoned and uninspired.  In addition, Crazy Pita chops the gyro lamb into chunks rather than thin strips.  It makes a gyro difficult to eat.  The hummus was fairly bland, but enjoyable to the extent that unflavored blended chick peas make you happy.  The pita was toasted and tasty, but, toasted white bread is pretty easy to make delicious.

All of this is pretty surprising given the price being charged by Crazy Pita.  The price tag says the restaurant is upscale with something unique to offer, but the food is generic and fairly bland Mediterranean.

Bottom line: it's not a bad place to stop into when you're stuck at the District at Green Valley and want something quick, but don't drive any distance to come here."}
{"text":"I came in during the night shift and WOWWW were these guys awesome. Kim was who took care of me and she was great. Big smile, great attitude and the food she suggested was so good! I will deff be returning here as long as Kim will be workimg there she is da bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"They accommodated are random 20 person group. They were beyond polite and helpful. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and everyone is super friendly!! I dont know how they cook their chicken but its soooo good"}
{"text":"Good healthy food at a reasonable price. I've never had anything there I didn't like. Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They have amazing Mediterranean food! I had the grilled vegetables plate with two skewers for $15... great prices and great food!"}
{"text":"Who would guess that the best customer service in town can be found at a casual pita spot?

I've been three times and love the food. My family is vegetarian but there is something for everyone. The skewers are seasoned perfectly, pitas are soft and yummy, falafel is solid. It's the service, though. Seriously every single person there is friendly and happy to make recommendations. Seriously, the employees seem genuinely happy. 

This place is a gem. I'll happily drive out of my way to visit a place that makes my family feel genuinely welcome."}
{"text":"Quick and cheap.

Our party had ordered the braised lamb plate and chicken pita wrap. The flavors of the meat were great! Seasoned very well and both the lamb and chicken were extremely tender.

What fell flat for me was the hummus and pita bread. The pita bread was warmed a bit too much for my liking. With its charred edges the pita bread hardened up too much. I prefer the pita to be warm, soft, and fluffy. In turn, their pita was a bit flaky. 

The hummus was pureed a bit too much for my liking. It was more like a liquid than a paste like texture. Perhaps, hummus is made differently everywhere, I did not care for it too much.

Overall, the service was fast, the meats here were great flavor wise, however their accompanying star side dishes fell flat."}
{"text":"LOVE this place,  the food so amazing and so is the service.   Every time I eat   there  the food is perfect and delicious,  the steak skewers have the most tender perfectly seasoned taste.    They just opened this 3rd location at downtown summerlin and they are very busy with a wait sometimes,  but that is because they are SO good!   Crazy Pita is Crazy Good !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places in town,  always friendly and every time delicious,  I used to drive all the way to Green Valley for this place and now so happy they opened Towne Square location, I've already eaten there 6 or 7 times  since they opened only a month or so ago."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I dont know what the hype is. I got tbe steak pita, goid, but i had no idea you could customize it. Nor did the cashier even let me know and it was my first time there.  Luckily the standard way it came was ok. Service pretty fast for a lunch rush.  Not enough seating though!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this place. I had the braised lamb plate and its so good! The manager Meddy I think his name is, is so friendly and every employee made us feel so at home. Best customer service ever! And amazing food too! Will definitely recommend it to my family and friends and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is always delicious and every single person is friendly and pleasant to talk to. You can definitely tell these employees love their job and are clearly appreciated. It makes us want to come back  I recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Food and service were excellent.  Dinners were fresh and tasty - I had the feta salad with a skewer and my husband had the rotisserie chicken pita and we were both happy with our meals. Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent staff!  We got a salad with kefta & lamb skewers.  Delicious!  The meat was made fresh, quick, and was super moist and delicious.  Great hot fluffy pita bread with an excellent side of hummus!  A+!  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"A pretty good spot if you are in the mood for some Mediterranean food in Downtown Summerlin. The location is bright and airy, and has an outdoor seating area as well. Everything is made to order, so after you place your order, you'll get a table number and your meal will be brought to you. All in all, it took perhaps 10 minutes.

The gyros are served with an order of fries, which aren't really that necessary or remarkable. I actually wished that I could order my gyro separately, as with the fries the cost was $8.99. (if they had an option for gyro-only for about $6.50, that would be perfect!).  There were large chunks of meat, feta cheese, olives, and cucumber within. It was very tasty, but be careful of those big meat chunks! Although tender enough, I almost choked on one because of the size.

The restaurant itself was pleasant, but I wasn't crazy about the fact that the bathrooms are located right next to the trash cans, in a small corridor, and they were 1-stall rest rooms. I can see that at busy times, there might be quite a line. They also were already showing signs of use and could have been better maintained.

All in all, I would return if I were out for a day of shopping."}
{"text":"We originally went to Bonefish but their waiting time was 30 mins. Good thing that was the case otherwise we would've not  gotten the opportunity to try this place out.   Glad we did. We got a friendly hello as soon as we walked in. Took us a little while to decide on what to order but the cashier was super friendly. He didn't make us feel rush at all...thank goodness no one was behind us tho! I ordered the mixed grill of any 2 skewers (chicken & steak) for me on that and my boyfriend got the chicken pita. Great choice!  The food took about 10 mins but when it finally arrived...the food was SUPER HOT exactly the way I like my food.  Hot, fresh,...and YUMMY!  The cashier came and check on us several times to see how we're doing. Very nice young man with great service and positive attitude. We will definitely come back again due to not only great and tasty good but AWESOME service!!!"}
{"text":"Food is so good here! Flavors are spot on and will make you crave it more!!!!  And they have lamb which makes me happy. Always friendly service!"}
{"text":"Not a fan......I ordered the $7.99 falafel Salad, and a veggie pita...my fiance got  a chicken pita....the cucumber salad tasted as if water had been run through it before its service to us....BLAND CITY! the humus was tasteless...and the cauliflower in my pita was a very dark brown/black color...as if it was rotten....it even tasted off as well so i sent it back....His chicken was a bit dry, and loaded with the tasteless watered down cucumber salad......one thing that turned us off was that I saw them pull the pitas out of bags....i understand if you run out and use store bought pita as back up...but with a name like Crazy Pita...you would think they have their supplies down pat?...espeically for a tuesday afternoon....pretty pricey for mediocre food....we wont be back..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I'm always looking for a place I can get a good, low-fat meal as I'm very calorie conscious. The awesome thing about this place is that you can go on their website and get the nutrients for each thing you got on your plate. I LOVE THAT! 

I posted a pic of my food on Instagram and their Instagram page person found me and gave me a shout out. Cool to know that someone appreciates your business. 

If I had any complaint, I would say maybe it's a little expensive. I got a chicken kabob plate and added a second chicken skewer (for more protein) and my total was around $16.00. 

Highly recommend this place for the delicious food. The server that bought us our food was super friendly so highly recommended for service as well!"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and I heard great things about this place but I didn't love it here. Perhaps I ordered the wrong things. The bf loved what we got, but perhaps bc I am a little bit more picky than he is. We got the braised lamb pita and the steak kabob plate. Both came up to about $22. A bit steep for lunch that wasn't that filling. The lamb was nice and soft, and I did enjoy the red sauce/chutney smeared on the bottom. Wish there was more in fact. And the steak chunks on the kabob were very tender and I was able to bite off pieces with my teeth, even though it was cooked to well done (not my preferred temp). But the portion sizes were small IMO and the tzatziki was so bland with neither cucumber, garlic, or lemon flavor to it; it just tasted like a thick yogurt.

The sides were alright, but nothing I can't make better at home. Couscous was bland. The hummus wasn't bad though. Pita bread was nice and fluffy. Fries were fries...nothing to write home about.

The service was very friendly but for the price/portion/taste I probably won't become a regular here."}
{"text":"This place and this location is amazing. I usually get the Cesar salad and the shrimp/steak skewer! Yes it's a little pricey but you get what you pay for, it's always cooked fresh and my cook on the food has always been perfect. They have great flavor/seasoning. I get a discount because I work in the mall ... Also they actually bring u the food and any sauces like olive oil etc. if u want which most places don't do. Their customer service has always made it a pleasure to eat here. Have been here on more than one occasion and always have a consistent experience. Would definitely recommend and would definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I work at town square and this is my favorite lunch spot. I haven't gotten past the shrimp pita and fries,  I'm addicted. The hummus is to die for."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this as I was hungry last Sunday afternoon thinking of where to find a good decent priced healthy meal. Whole Foods again? So I drove to the District and parked. Then noticed a sign that said \"Crazy Pita Parking Only.\" I thought hmmm well that's different & I think I have a buy one get one 50% off voucher I received from a gift bag at Town Square. Why not try it?! The mgr noticed me glancing over the menu & asked me a few questions to better determine my needs. I mentioned I like to eat vegetarian, huge fan of eggplant, and open minded. I purchased two meals to go so I could have both lunch & dinner. They were prepared quite quickly, price was great, staff was helpful, and friendly, and this was made incredibly easy for me. I would definitely return here again. Suitable for both vegetarians & non vegetarians. I'm sure everything here tastes just as good. There's quite a bit to select from & you can modify or substitute items.
What I ordered:
Vegetarian Pita w/ eggplant dip inside it, had falafel for a side , some hummus, pita bread, moroccan couscous, veggie skewers, tabouli, more hummus. 
All this was incredible. The vegetarian pita was excellent. Hummus was room temperature & fresh, skewers full of flavor, moroccan couscous had a good spice to it. 
I was happy. Places like this where you can stop in, grab some healthy quick food with good service makes your day. I'm thrilled to say you've made a customer out of me."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out! I am not disappointed!! Really good pita and hummus!! I got the build your self plate and it comes with alot!! Must check it out!!"}
{"text":"The Chicken skewers are delicious and come with cucumber salad, couscous and hummus with warm pita bread. This place is always clean and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I like this place. They have really good pita and hummus. One thing that I don't like too much is falafel. It is so salty it's almost bitter. I had last time I thought maybe they made mistake that time.  I'm here and giving another chance. It is so salty. I think today is actually worst then last time. Other then that I like this place. Roasted bell peppers are awesome."}
{"text":"Roasted chicken is super good and the feta salad is amazing! Love this place for a quick, healthy lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mediterranean Restaurant is Crazy Pita, this rotisserie produces some of the best tasting grilled meats and vegetables around.  It's a reliable, healthy dining choice and lunch is always packed, it's the most popular venue at Green Valley District! (my opinion)

We had a great lunch outside; it was a warm, sunny day and we took Stella out on an outing!! Since it was her birthday, we decided to give her some special attention.  Next to the Crazy Pita is the Flea Bag Bakery & Bow-tique where we got her Birthday bone cookie and party favors for Sam and Frank.

We started out the meal with some cold carbs: the grape leaves had our appetites going with the citrus and tangy flavors complementing the rice-it's a great appetizer or a light snack.

If you order one of the main entree plates, get ready for a full meal!  Here, we have the Mezza Salad platter; Cucumber Salad, Roasted Red Peppers, Artichoke Hearts, Hummus, Babganoush, and Feta Cheese with Olives.  We added a Chicken Kabob for the Protein, (not that we needed anymore food) marinated cubes of Chicken is great to dip into the Hummus and vegetables!

Our favorites here is any of the Pita sandwiches: this time, we ordered the Chicken Pita with Roasted Red Peppers and Hummus.  It's all pretty much the same thing, just wrapped in with more carbs, but who cares?  Also, they sell the bread here, which you should get because it's one the best pitas breads available to us here in Vegas.

Another Pita sandwich that we get a lot is the Lamb-it's pretty decadent but soooo friction good!

{"text":"UPDATE: hummus is still runny (*video posted this time)

Haven't been here for 6months.. Wanted to give it another shot and see if they ever corrected the \"hummus problem\"

Updated my review here because the hummus is not up to par. It's the one thing that bugs me about this place. It's very watered down and runny. Hope management/ owner recognizes that people don't want runny, watered down hummus.

Other then the hummus.. The Chicken skewer plate is a great choice. Always seasoned well with a side of warm pita."}
{"text":"Wow the salmon here is so amazing! And the hummus is so smooth and fresh. I love this place and the fact that it is locally owned. I highly recommend the braised lamb and couscous as well. This is a goto dinner and lunch place for our family!"}
{"text":"Entered into the patio seating with a Yorkie.  Order at the counter.  Take your number to your table and they bring your food over when it is ready.  Server was so kind to also grab a bowl of water for the dog.  Quite hot sitting outside.  She played with the dog a bit, and said \"I will have to wash my hands but you are just so cute!\"  Which was assuring.  I work in service and am a chronic hand washer!  Lol

The food was great. Steak pita: meat was tender and tasty. The pita soft.  Refreshing cucumber.  Eggplant sauce and yogurt sauces really come together nicely.  Fresh clean and well put together compared to other Mediterranean spots I have tried.  Would eat here again."}
{"text":"The food is good (same menu as the other locations) but it does take a while for it to arrive. Admittedly it was lunchtime so I suppose the lesson to learn is if you are hungry it is better to come outside of the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Wow!! I'd only been to the location at Town Square before. This Crazy Pita is excellent!! The food is really great! I had the kefta plate and it was one of the best I've ever had! My wife had both chicken and steak skewers which were outstanding as well. The staff is just so warm and attentive. Super nice people! We're excited to return."}
{"text":"Bleh how is this place 4 stars??? The food was bland and the selection, well... It's nothing spectacular. I gave this place 2 stars for location and value. It's located in Town Center which is super! But there were other restaurants in this mall that I would much rather have tried instead of this place. Ughhhh

I had the steak tenderloin kabob plate. The whole plate was so bland even the tzasiki sauce it came with. The hummus was more like a watered down mashed potatoes .   I've definitely had better. 

Never again! NEXXXXXXXT!!!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in GVR. The pitas and skewers are absolutely out of control. The two skewer plate is a great choice with any meat, although the lamb is probably the best you're ever going to have anywhere so if you're open to new flavors I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband found a piece of latex glove on the pita! Gross....!!!! They just said sorry didn't offer to replace the dish so we just left! I think they were expecting us to keep eating it with the latex pieces inside!"}
{"text":"Today I was in the mood for a healthy delight before my hair appointment just across the street so Crazy Pita it was!

I had previously raved about this hidden treasure but today's experience fell a bit short and here's the main reason:

Price.

I spent $12.00 on a grilled chicken pita  that consisted primarily of lettuce accompanied by a handful of generic french fries. Don't get me wrong, the flavoring (in the very little bit of chicken I received) was delicious, but the pita was not soft at all and the flavorless lettuce just didn't do the trick.

Though I'm disappointed in my second visit here, the friendly service did make up for  a small portion of what was lacking in the food.

If I want to pay $12 for a salad on a piece of pita bread I'll go to Whole Foods next time ;)"}
{"text":"Great food for that price range.  Food is freshly prepared.  If I have to make a comment, the menu is kind of confusing.  They should revise the menu."}
{"text":"For a quick and healthy lunch I give this place 5 stars. I'm surprised I have never been to crazy pita. Everything tasted really well and the service was good too. They have an outside seating area at town square. I ordered some vegetarian grape leaves as an appetizer which are served cold. My lunch was a chicken bowl which came with chicken cooked just right (small portions) 
with yellow rice mmmmmmm, feta cucumber salad , hummus and pita bread. I found my quick and healthy  go to lunch spot."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because I always pass by it whenever I go to Townsquare. Finally, I had time to stop by and try a pita!

I went and got a falafel pita that comes with french fries. If you'd like, you can substitute it with another side for .99! The falafel was not that good, however. I felt like it didn't have a lot of flavor. I may be a little biased since I had the best falafel back in the East Coast, but I try not comparing it.

The ambiance is really nice. Its a cute place and nice location. I am just not crazy about these pitas! I may try another one and hopefully, it'll be better than the falafel!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Town Square I HAVE to stop and eat here (I live too far now) when I worked near by i are here at least 3x a week. I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Place is ok... Not bad if you need something quick. 

I wasn't impressed by the hummus nor the pita they served it on.

The steak and chicken were ok - nothing to go home and rave about."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious!!! The chicken is always juicy and mouth watering!! The service is great!!! Super friendly and attentive!! My friend and I sat outside, they brought us all our food to our table and were courteous enough to ask us twice throughout if we needed anything and if we were doing ok. I was so impressed!! Lovely environment and I definitely will be back!!! :)"}
{"text":"I will not waste my money here EVER again. I ordered the combo skewer plate with lamb and chicken. The lamb was TOUGH as shoe leather and the chicken was DRY as wood. I will pay for good food but $14.99 for tough dry food is a no for me. Sorry Crazy Pita, your food looks good in pictures but fails in quality."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here after reading about the long wait when they first opened. We decided to take a chance and try something new. My friend and I shared the combo plate which includes a steak and chicken skewer, couscous, vegetables, pita bread, cucumber salad, and hummus. I really enjoyed the juicy and tender chicken skewer, seasoned and grilled well, and slightly charred on the outside. I thought the chicken was tastier than the steak.

They hooked us up with a lot of pita bread and hummus which I couldn't stop eating. Also, tried the eggplant dip with pita bread. I can picture myself snacking on this. The two male employees I dealt with on my first visit were very polite and genuinely nice which made me want to come back. The wait wasn't long, your usual 15 minute wait for your food."}
{"text":"Good food and great patio dining.  Parking is lousy but it always is at the district."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today at Crazy Pita.  The quality is always excellent and consistent.  We were in a bit of a rush and it was a perfect choice for a great, quick meal.  Our favorite is the chicken in any form, salad, pita or plate. I highly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! it totally hit the spot on a super hot day! there was enough seating space inside and the staff was attentive and super nice.  $20 for a meal for 2, who can complain? the food was tasty and the sides were delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok, I will not claim to know this type of food. I have it now and then, but not frequently. So I'm not an expert. All I know is, I had their chicken pita and it was amazing! 

I often times wonder how someone can mess up a sandwich or salad, but it happens. Pita wraps I have had in the past may have had meat that was too dry, or way too much hummus or sauce in it, or too much veggies and not enough meat. You get the picture. This was just right. The chicken was so moist and flavored perfectly. Their was a perfect balance of veggies and meat, and the veggie mix was seasoned perfectly and the amount of hummus was just right. I didn't think I'd be able to eat the whole thing because I usually can only manage half a pita of that size, but it was so good, I couldn't stop eating.

The place is clean and the service good. What brought me in here in the first place was we were going to see a movie and had some time before it started. I was hungry and didn't want movies nachos, so we came here. There weren't many other quick options around. I'm so glad I stumbled on this place. I cannot wait to go again."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is way above average, the place is super clean and the prices are very decent. It's a new Town Square favorite. Great for before or after a movie since it's right by AMC Cinemas."}
{"text":"Finally, a casual quick food dining place in Townsquare for those of us who are hungry but not sit-down restaurant-waiter-type hungry. I love Mediterranean food but this spot missed on the hummus and the pita bread (crucial elements in the whole experience). The hummus was too watery and had this nutty flavor not to my liking while the pita bread was clearly store-bought (I'm pretty sure I bought the same one from costco once). The best thing we tried was the chicken skewer which justifies for the 'rotisserie' part of the establishment. In fact, it was what we tried on the sample plate out front before deciding to eat here."}
{"text":"I am so happy that Crazy Pita is now on the West side of town! I have been going to their locations in The District and Town Square for as long as they have been open(I even used to go to their original location on Horizon Ridge), but only when I am out that way for work as I live in the Northwest. Everything I have ever had there is GREAT! I love the Kefta, chicken skewers and wow the veggies skewers are to die for. Now that they are on \"my side\" of town I finally got to introduce my husband to their food and he loved it as well - he had the gyro sandwich. The service was fantastic, as always. I saw some of the other reviews that mention the waiting time. In the 8 years I have been eating at Crazy Pita's across the valley, that has never been an issue, so I can only guess it is because of the grand opening of Downtown Summerlin and so few of the other restaurants being open yet.
You really MUST eat here!"}
{"text":"You would think that Greek food would be a natural for casual, take out places.  You can make a lot of the food ahead.  It is good served cold.  Much of it is finger food.  Yet, with the possible exception of some places in Chicago, most of the Greek take out places I have been to are subpar.  Crazy Pita is no exception to this rule.  We ordered a falafel sandwich, a shrimp skewer, and a mezza plate (feta, hummus, artichoke hearts, cucumber salad, and roasted peppers) to share.  As I expected, the shrimp was tough and was sitting on some watery vegetables and undercooked couscous.  But it was the hummus that surprised us the most -- thin, drippy, and tasteless.  The pita served with it was dry.  The roasted peppers had no flavor or texture.  The best things were the cucumber salad and the falafel.  Now I have had better falafel, plumper and spicier, but this at least was crisp, moderately spicy and did not fall apart.  I could only compare this to the delicious hummus, gyros, and stuffed eggplant we had at Max's Greek Cafe in the San Francisco airport.  If you can't serve better food than an airport cafe, then you can't expect to stay in business for very long."}
{"text":"The oral surgeon I refer our patients to delivered Crazy Pita to my dental office today.  And to be honest, I'm not a huge fan of meats that are on a skewer because they tend to be dry especially chicken.  But I gotta say, the chicken was so soft and tender, I loved it!  It's the first time in my life I could say I prefer the grilled chicken over the beef.  The roasted chicken was fantastic as well.

We also had the appetizer sampler, which was good, along with their green salad.  I really liked their Greek dressing.

The stars of the show were definitely the chicken.  Eating those alone with some hummus and you'll be straight."}
{"text":"I love the steak screwers and it really is great food that is not too expensive. Great service as well! Definitely a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!
* friendly and helpful service
* clean restaurant
* wonderful food

A group of 6 of us came in (4 adults and 2 kids) on a Sunday evening.  The kids got shrimp on a stick which was so wonderfully seasoned, but maybe a bit much for their palate.  No problem because we (the grown ups) were happy to gobble them up.

I had the chicken pita which had a thinner hummos as the 'sauce' and a delightful little diced cucumber and onion relish-type stuff.  Chicken was seasoned and cooked perfectly!  My husband had the falafel that sat in that lovely hummos.  All in all a wonderful meal and quite a surprise for a counter-order, mall restaurant.

(4 stars for some small, nit picky things:  (1) kids' shrimp had a strong (yet delicious) garlic & curry flavoring and that's a tough sell to little ones  (2) the hummos was yummy on a pita as a sauce, but on its own was a little thin )"}
{"text":"This is the exact type of place that as a restaurant owner I get disappointed in people in general. There's nothing wrong with it, but there's really nothing that good about it either. It has a good look the food is okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. At the same time they have a line out the door which amazes me. Places that are way better struggle while these chains thrive."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. All the employees here were very nice and hospitable. The skewers are very tasty and the pita is the best I've ever had. Give this place a try if you're in the downtown summerin area."}
{"text":"Upon arrival my family and I were greeted, which was nice. I ordered the land skewer. It was ok, the couscous was bland and I wish the cucumber salad had more feta. As for the lamb, it tasted well cooked. It wasn't the greatest Greek place, but this place isn't the mom and pops type of restaurant. Looks like a chain restaurant. I'm giving it a four star cause of the service."}
{"text":"Food was good, but WAY over priced. I got 3 kebabs and it cost $24 could have got a steak dinner for that."}
{"text":"Would not go back. 

This place looked interesting and was very busy, so I decided to skip Panera and try it. I grew up in Detroit and love authentic Mediterranean food. Both my food and service experience were disappointing. 

The price is high ($10 for a falafel pita and a side if you won't want fries) and I waited for nearly 15 minutes for my order. When I received it, it had french fries instead of my .95 cent side of hummus. I let them know and they gave me a side of hummus. Then they chased me down in the parking lot because they gave me the wrong pita as well. They said it was my lucky day because I got two pitas for the price of one. When I got back to work to eat, the \"free mystery pita\" had been covered in ketchup that they just put in the to-go box instead of a container. The entire pita bread was ruined, but the steak contents survived (I don't eat steak any how). Although the manager/owner was very nice, the ordering experience was all messed up. 

Now onto the food, the falafal was dry, the pita bread soggy and the hummus is a bland runny mess. You can always judge a place by the pita bread and hummus and this is not good stuff. 

Do not waste your time...this place is just so so."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and everything was fantastic. The employees were very nice, we ate outside in a lovely little patio and the food was great. Nice kids menu and their rotisserie and pitas were tasty as well. The only thing I will change next time is replacing the fries that came with my son's dinner for hummus instead, this was my fault as I didn't read the whole description for his meal."}
{"text":"I had my usual chicken skewer plate, served with a Greek salad, chicken over buttery couscous (light and fluffy) and the best hummus I can find in the Las Vegas area.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I drive from Summerlin to eat at this wonderful Mid Eastern restaurant. They have the best hummus I've ever had!!  The owner is very nice and remembers his loyal customers!

This place is a real find.  The Chicken Swewer plate includes steamed zucchini and butternet squash atop deliciously light coucous, seasoned with spices including cinammon, diced cucumber, feta, kalamata olives and diced tomato salad, with delicious chicken skewers seasoned perfectly with all kinds of seasoning very delicious!  The secret is in their seasonings and spices"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out in the new Down town Summerlin.  I was not disappointed at all.  It starts out at the front counter with many types of Pita sandwiches or Platters.  We order the Shawarma plate with a falafel pita sandwich and chicken tenders for the kidos.  After ordering we got a number and cups to self serve at the drink station. 

Food came out of the kitchen rather  quickly and the presentation was done well.       
What I most enjoyed about the meal was the flavors.  Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly.  The rice was perfect and delicious as well as the hummus.  The meat was cooked to a perfect medium and was also very flavorful.  I will be back to visit this place to try other protein options with mashed up garbanzo beans.

Oh yeah the staff was also very friendly and helpful.  They were smiling and even made suggestions while ordering.  They even tried to upsell the flakey pastry Baklava while we were at the counter. We declined but nice training of the staff at this restaurant.  Great Job Jeffe's."}
{"text":"Until stumbling across the positive Yelp reviews for this place, I didn't consider eating here, mostly because of the name.  For some reason, It reminded me of those awful all you can eat sushi places.  Wow, was I wrong!  It's not fast food, but is fresh food prepared quickly and deliciously!  I just wish I had been right about the all you can eat thing."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! 

Came here for lunch today, and now have turned a friend on to it. 

Ordered the Steak Pita with a side of hummus! 
The steak was tender and tasty with crisp cucumber & tomatos then fresh pita bread wrapped around it ! Perfect combination. The hummus was creamy with a hint of garlic.. 

My lunch date enjoyed it too, she had the Chicken Pita. 

The service is great. They are happy to have your business and it shows. 
Always friendly and helpful with any questions you may have. After bringing the food to you, they are always following up to see if everyone is to your liking..... again, great service! 

Would love to try another entree but when you find something that you like... its hard to change."}
{"text":"I'm so loving this place. Staff are nice, give me great recommendation. Foods are amazing. They don't have it on the menu but if you ask, they have a salmon salad. This is yummy!!"}
{"text":"Just had their signature dish.  It was a beef gyro They marinate and spice up the beef phenomenal.   I was very impressed with the food and the portion is decent.  Its a great lunch or dinner.  I will def cone back.  They also have good customer service.   And now my tummy feels great!!!   Try it !!"}
{"text":"Salmon was nicely flavored and pita was awesome!!!!  Pita was Fresh, soft and doughy....never had a doughy pita before."}
{"text":"I go to Crazy Pita for the Kabobs.

Their meat is thick cut, juicy and tender. Not like the thin, bone dry slabs of meat I've seen at other Kabob places.

I love the beef, chicken and shrimp kabobs.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food at this concept is consistently good and fresh.  The ingredient quality is top notch and the recipes flavorful.  Another plus is the friendly and attentive staff, makes this restaurant have a full service feel when it's an order at the counter and wait and we will bring it to you kind of place.  

I was also enjoying the beer choices. They have a couple of crafty beers that were perfect to enjoy on a beautiful fall day while dining on the patio. Great place for lunch.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My first time eating this cuisine ever! 

The staff is friendly and very welcoming.
I ordered their chicken Cesar salad to be safe since I've never had this cuisine and it was pretty bomb. I wish I could find something as good as this place in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here I get the feeling there's some old Greek man somewhere shaking his fist in disgust. It's not that the food is bad, it's just that saying that Crazy Pita has authentic Greek food is like saying Taco Bell has authentic Mexican food.

The only real draw to this place is the location. It's inside The District and very close to my work. So if you're pressed for time or tired of waiting in line over at Panera Bread, feel free to try this place. Otherwise go find yourself a little Greek mom & pop shop where a little old lady in an apron is slicing your lamb in big slabs.... aka the right way."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is really delicious...I especially like the grilled salmon skewers. Also, the falafel is the best I have ever had. The service is friendly and quick. I highly recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"My wife and i come here for lunch quite often.  I always get the steak pita and i love it.  Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and every time the staff is so friendly. This is always somewhere I think of to grab a quick, healthy bite to eat."}
{"text":"First off, the service here was great. You order at the counter and they deliver the food. Even though this is not a table service restaurant the staff was great about occasionally checking on you. The food was good too, we had a few things:

- Hummus was very good
- Pita was warm, tasty and there was plenty
- Grape Leaves were a little soggy, the leaves did not have that slight snap that you look for, I would not get them again
- Falafel  was good as well

Overall I would go here again, we diddnt try any of the kebobs but they smalled great."}
{"text":"Pretty good place if you want a quick meal. Its totally fast food but healthier than grabbing a burger. You walk in stand in line and order, you get a number and take a seat weather you are dining in or taking to go. 

I asked about the beef patties and the girl taking my order couldn't give me an answer. I am used to Armenian food so I asked if it was like beef lula she couldn't answer that. So I got the mixed skewers steak and chicken over couscous and veggies. It comes with a cucumber salad, hummus and pita bread. The salad is refreshing. The couscous a bit bland. The hummus was really smooth, it didn't have that grit or texture I'm used to. Still tasty though. The meat was good, and juicy. I would come here again but definitely not for the pita it looked and tasted packaged."}
{"text":"One of the nicer Mediterranean restaurant chains in town. I love the food, the service and the atmosphere here, and I should say in all of the crazy pita chains. (I think there are three or four locations now) will definitely go back to these spots."}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place a try finally bc it has healthy options after the gym. First I ordered mixed grill with kefta and lamb. The price is different from the menu on Yelp.....it's $14.99 not $12.99. The kefta was way over cooked, burnt/charred....although the lamb was edible didn't have much flavor. My husband ordered a chicken pita and altogether it was over $25 bucks and definitely not worth it. Maybe it was on and off night (7pm Friday)?! All and all I'm never going here again, I can find something with better prices and actually good food takeout after the gym. (besides the cafe inside)"}
{"text":"They have some of the best food I've eaten and they're exceptionally customer oriented! They have earned a loyal customer, we will continue to come and eat here often!!"}
{"text":"I go in and ask if the salad dressing contains dairy and am told that \"there shouldn't be\". Then she proceeds to tell me that it comes on the side and that I don't have to eat it if I don't want to, which kinda defeats the purpose of why I was asking. I told her I just needed to know if the dressing contained dairy and she then tells me no. I find it funny that it went from there shouldn't be any to there isn't any. Most places are willing to actually find out for you, but this employee obviously wasn't. I'll take my dairy free self elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh- all words to describe this yummy food!! Easy for Gluten Free people like myself to find plenty to eat!!  Grilled veggies and hummus and shrimp!"}
{"text":"Really like this place, casual, comfortable. The food is very good and priced well compared to other Mediterranean restaurants. The most generous portion of hummus and pita I've ever gotten as part of a platter from any restaurant, for some reason they are all so stingy with the pita. Beef and chicken kabobs were very good, cucumber, feta salad is good as well. Hummus is ok. Overall I would definitely go back if in the area. Really wish they had some great Greek fries with the seasoning and feta."}
{"text":"If you are looking for quick, tasty Mediterranean cuisine then Crazy Pita is your place.  The steak pita is fabulous...the steak is juicy and tender, the pita is super fresh and the feta has just the right tang.  The Mezza salad is a fav for me with a sampling of Hummus and Eggplant dip...both are creamy with a lot of flavor.  To some the price point can be a little high but there are always coupons floating around to soften the blow for the budget conscious.  Crazy Pita is definitely a good, healthy alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Authentic Mediterranean food, nice and fresh and tasty, the chicken is very good with lemon squeezing and a very nice grilled shish kebab. We love the hummus which is nice and fresh, and we love the couscous which is very fresh. The service is great, ideal location, what more can I say. They have parking for carry out and plenty of parking for paying customers. The bistro is very nice. My wife who is a foodie give this five stars as do I."}
{"text":"I love the mixed grill of two skewers, greek salad, hummus, pitas and couscous. Very well prepared for a fast food kind of restaurant.  Always consistently good.  Fast and hot as well.  I like that they are at the District at Green Valley Ranch. Outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Love the chicken here. Juicy, flavorful. Feta salad also good, but would like a little more feta. Pita is soft and warm, hummus is pretty good. There's better hummus but it's fine here. Friendly staff. Booze options. Comfortable environment with two televisions, usually showing sports. A bit pricier than I would like but not by much. Definitely worth trying. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite greek places.  The food, especially the steak skewers is high quality and cooked perfect every time.  Service is friendly and helpful. I love the hummus and vegetables that comes with the order. My kids love it too and so healthy"}
{"text":"Braised Lamb Shank. Need I say more? 

Oh wait Pita Bread. Oh and some of the best hummus I have ever had. 

Fresh food served quickly, by nice people in a clean restaurant.  

Go there.  Order the lamb shank. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Have only eaten here once, but intend to return.

Food was good, including rostiserie chicken, hummus, falafel, salads, etc...

Staff was very accommodating.  Believe the owner or GM was manning the order counter/register when we were there.  Offered my child a complimentary lemonade, and allowed us to substitute some salad options - very nice service.

Recommended for a casual and reasonably priced, quality family oriented restaurant."}
{"text":"Been to all 3 locations in Vegas and all great. Kind of reminds me of a greek/Mediterranean Chipotle in a sense lol! Also all 3 locations have great workers. 
Love that they serve couscous"}
{"text":"Soso - nothing outstanding and nothing bad. Just run of the mill place with run of the mill food. Service was great. Food could have been larger portioned."}
{"text":"I went on a Mediterranean kick back in college... I would go crazy for hummus at a Daphne's location in Westwood and ravenously devour it so quickly that a worker once came out and gave me more free. Crazy Pita's eggplant dip gives me that same feeling. I'm not sure why they don't call it baba ganoush (maybe eggplant dip is more understandable or it's not traditionally prepared), but I love it! This place was first recommended to me by one of my fitness instructors from Eleve who thought they deserved both delicious and more guilt-free food. Their portions are huge and they offer to give you even more pita bread to take home if you still have leftovers (which is a good, but dangerous thing). The staff here was very gracious and kept tabs on their customers well. The restaurant is located on one of the corners of downtown Summerlin (southeast) and there is ample parking across the street."}
{"text":"When crazy pita first opened their doors in downtown summerlin we drove by and saw a line out the door. As much as I love pitas we decided to come back another day. Days turned into months and we finally ate here. 
This is now a go to spot to get fast, fresh good quality food. 
My go to meal is the chicken pita with a side of taziki sauce. The vegetables are always crunchy and fresh, the chicken is juicy and tender and the pitas are nice and soft. They have a rotisserie in the chicken cooking their meats on site which is always a positive reassurance the food is fresh.
Whether you're a vegetarian or a meat eater this establishment will not disappoint. They offer pita wraps, salads and offer a make your own plate with options of lamb, rotisserie chicken, beef, hummus, ect.  There's also a location in town square and they are just as fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get something fast and close to my work.  I work right next to the District and had noticed this place before.  I decided to check it out.  I made sure to Yelp the place to see what I should get.  I read about 10 posts about the steak pita.  I told the girl at the counter that everybody on Yelp were talking about the steak pita.  I order it and took it back to office.  I have to say it was the best steak pita I have ever had!  This handheld piece of heaven was incredible.  I don't even know where to start.  The meat was so tender and cooked to perfection.  The sauce was tasty and really complimented the meat.  Just get the steak pita and you can thank me later!  The only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars is because it can get busy and you can wait up to 15 or more minutes to get your food.  I suggest calling in the order before you go.  I'm sure if they let you, but I'm going to try to call it in next time."}
{"text":"I just had the most wonerful grilled salmon ever.This was better than any 5 star restaurant by far and very affordable.I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I get the chicken pita and it is always amazing! Ordering is easy, the drink machine is one of those super cool coke ones with all the different flavors and I get the sparkling flavored dasani water. You can sit inside or out on the patio and they will bring the food to you when it is finished. I have been there three times so far and I LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Best food I ever had! I would like to describe their concept as a gourmet restaurant with a fast food theme, if you can imagine that. The table service was flawless too.
NOT cheap, but what you could expect on such a prime location.

One thing I hate though is that they ask for tip upon arrival and then if you dont pay any they dont automatically get you the little sauces. Tip is a form of blackmail so I will not come back here for a while."}
{"text":"This is a good addition to the quick food choices in the Downtown Summerlin area.
Many of the better food choices at this new mall are a bit more of a commitment in time and energy. (not all there are several quicker places too)

What I like about Crazy Pita is it is all fresh healthy ingredients, made to order.
It is really easy to keep your choices to protein and greens, which I personally love. Healthy and low calorie. Entrees run $10-$14, Sides run $5-$6. So it is pretty affordable.

The service was fine, the room is nothing special. It feels like a fast-food cafeteria.
It ALL functions perfectly. Not amazing, but really good, simple & easy.
Some days, especially after shopping for hours, simple and easy is JUST what is needed!!"}
{"text":"This place holds up over time!  
Consistent Quality and Taste!  :)

Plus, they serve up tasty food fast.  It is NOT fast food.

I really enjoy their Lamb Kabobs, but what I REALLY LOVE here is their vegetable couscous.  

Their couscous is light, airy and has squash in it which I LOVE.  :)

The folks here are nice and quick.

In the past year, I've typically called in my order and picked it up.  So Easy!

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an easy meal that is tasty and healthy."}
{"text":"Extremely nice waiters and cashiers.
1st time here would definitely come back for gyro."}
{"text":"Absolute best healthy fast food anywhere around. LOVE this place. First thing you notice when you go in is that it is immaculate and shining. They cook in an open kitchen so there are no secrets here, the cleanliness is through and through. Food is amazing and always tastes like someone has been slaving for hours. I can't praise this place enough. If they were within walking distance I would be eating there every single day. Best Mediterranean food around and the staff is wonderful. Very nice, always happy, and they always remember us when we go in. Their chicken is the absolute best I've had."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great surprise today at lunch. Lamb shank with all of the accoutrements. So tender and flavorful. Only $11.95. Really. That is so reasonable for such a time intensive dish."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I'm here on a work trip and needed a quick lunch before I start my day. I waited 45 minutes from cash wrap to food on the table to eat when I had an entire hour for my lunch set aside. The business model is poor and not equipped to service the clientele that wants to eat at this shopping center. Tighten up your screws if you want to survive this market. Thank you for the rushed lunch and stomach ache. PS the food is OK. Not worth 45 minutes. It's just a sandwich at the end of the day or a plate of romaine...I love this type of food and would love to enjoy it on my visits, but I can't afford the time I lose. Thanks."}
{"text":"For my first time, i was very impressed. First let's start off by saying i have a slight touch of OCD  and this place is very clean, well groomed and the wait staff & preparers are clean also and health standard appropriate. I got the chicken bowl, which was very yummy, great priced for the quality & quantity. The pita bread served on the side was fresh, warm and very delicious and the sauces had enough spice not to burn but to add the flavor to the bowl. Last but not least, the young Caucasian guy who helped me was patient w me, i had many questions and he was helpful. Sorry, i can't remember his name but i know it was right before ending of his shift; but still very assertive and made sure Bf i left that i was happy. Definitely will be returning !!! Thank you mystery cashier and all the staff at Crazy  Rita's who made my visit wonderful"}
{"text":"Expensive. Chunks of meat hard to chew. Would've been nice if meat was sliced instead. Not enough takasi sauce. Best part was pita and hummus. Don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Food was amazing delivery girl was nice. Will definitely be ordering again soon for home and work!!! Shot out to Marcus at the henderson location his customer service rocks"}
{"text":"Marcus was amazingly helpful during my phone order today ! He definitely went the extra step and more to make sure my delivery was handled correctly( do to wrong info from another store. ) my delivery was quick fresh correct and unbelievably delicious!! again thanks Marcus for making this Sunday lunch amazing and delicious your AWESOME"}
{"text":"Amazing couscous, chicken roasted to perfection, a meal under $10...what' not to like? One of the cheaper and better options in the district, it's a filling meal that you don't feel guilty about, wallet-wise or calorie-wise. They've got great kabobs. There's usually a five minute wait for the food, but that's ok. The food is worth waiting for, not everyone is Mcdonald's!"}
{"text":"I have to blame Town Square for not having been to the Green Valley District in forever, and thus not having discovered Crazy Pita before now.  Granted the place doesn't have the best real estate in the District, but make sure to seek it out when you visit, so you won't miss out on some yummy Greek food that's also healthy!

Very simple interiors with some cute photos of the Greek coast on the wall, I like the bright and clean feeling of the decor.  The staff is very helpful, I changed my mind about taking the food to go and they were quick to pour a glass of water so I could eat there.  

Gyros are yummy, filled with veggies and meat, they're worth every dollar.  The roasted vegetables couscous is warm and full of flavor, the kind that my imaginary Greek grandma would make for me.  They even have whole wheat pita, if you're on a no-white-carbs health run like me.

A perfect exclamation to a good meal: they carry The Republic of Tea bottled iced teas - simply the best iced tea on the planet.  Sure it's 5 bucks, but with the inexpensive yet high-quality food, it makes for a well-rounded meal."}
{"text":"Great customer service..  The food was delish , but I took two stars off, one for not having basmati rice and the existing rice  totally tasted like boxed microwaved rice.. Other star was for having really small portions for the price.. Braised meat was great!! I really think they specialize more on gyros!!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. They are missing the mark on food. Salad dressing is store bought. Meats are tough. Hummus is bland. Menu reads super but tastes less than average. Would not come back unless they became a more authentic Mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is consistently fresh and solidly good, and the restaurant is clean and bright and well-lighted, which are all lovely, but what's best about this place are the people who work here."}
{"text":"Great food with reasonable prices.  The owner and staff are always friendly.  They also send great discounts if you sign up on their e-mail list."}
{"text":"The taste and service as I described it earlier just gets better. 

If you're anywhere near Downtown Summerlin, get into Crazy Pita for a high-level taste without the crazy high prices their neighbor restaurants are charging."}
{"text":"super delicious vegetarian friendly food & really friendly owner! love it!"}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is a casual, no-fuss place to eat good, healthy Mediterranean/Greek food that tastes fresh and simple. You order at the counter, sit down at a table of your choice, and then wait for your order to be brought. When you're done eating, they clean up after you. Fast food, but with higher quality ingredients and higher prices- thumbs up in my book of good eats. 

I ordered the Salmon Skewer (on the specials menu)- one skewer of grilled salmon cubes marinated in a blend of lemon, herbs & spices (I think) served atop a bed of seasoned couscous and steamed zucchini & orange squash, and comes with a side of Feta Salad and Hummus (with your choice of Regular or Whole Wheat Pita slices). 

Salmon Skewer- The salmon tasted fresh, but a little too salty; however, when eaten together with the mild-tasting couscous, the saltiness balanced out. 

Couscous Mix- The couscous was lightly-flavored (maybe with chicken stock), and while I enjoyed the steamed orange squash (Butternut Squash, I believe), I didn't enjoy the overly-mushy zucchini. 

Feta Salad- Diced tomatoes, cucumbers & red onions, Bulgarian Feta Cheese & Kalamata Olives tossed in a light dressing and served atop a few pieces of Romaine lettuce. Pretty good. I could've done without the two pieces of lettuce that sat beneath the cucumber/tomato mix though. They looked like they were there for decoration, not part of the salad. 

Hummus with Pita Bread- The hummus was good, but I wish the pita bread was fluffier/softer. 

My mom ordered the Chicken Pita which comes with a side of Fries. If you like McDonald's fries, you'll like the fries at Crazy Pita. The fries were crispy, crunchy, piping hot...everything a fry should be.They were my favorite part of the meal; the fries get one whole star all to themselves. 

I think the next time I go, I'll try the chicken skewer or pita with a side of fries (of course). Also, I really liked the utensil dispensers (my first time seeing these), and wish that every fast food place has them installed sometime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is fresh tasting & high quality and the people working there are friendly. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Loved the food and service. The owner impressed me with his warmth, individual approach to visiting with customers and bringing the food to the table.  Food was delicious (I had the Falafel Pita and hubby had the lamb pita) but the genuine service made it an even better experience."}
{"text":"This place is so good!  Downtown was the first time I tried it. Busy from the opening,  but worth the wait! The lamb skewers are my favorite.....and the hummus too.  The Town Square store is just as yummy.  Their healthy food options are impressive."}
{"text":"Lamb pita was very good, and the staff was very nice, but it took over 20 minutes to get my order. I'm not sure what the problem was, because they're fully staffed and there doesn't seem to be a rush.

I'll give it another shot, but this wasn't a great first experience"}
{"text":"Nothing crazy about this food except for the price.

Do yourself a favor and head over to a mom and pop shop and eat authentic greek food, this is overpriced and undersliced!"}
{"text":"A casual Mediterranean eaterie. I ate here when I came to the opening of Downtown Summerlin. I ordered the Mixed Grill of Two Skewers Plate with steak and chicken. The steak skewer was a bit overdone and slightly chewy, but still fairly good....but the chicken skewer was top notch. If chicken can melt in your mouth, this chicken did! The skewers were served on a bed of flavorful couscous with a cucumber salad and hummus on the side. I especially enjoyed the pita bread--it was very light and soft, almost fluffy! The service was excellent, the servers were friendly and very attentive. I will definitely go back, maybe to try the shrimp or salmon. Or maybe to see if that chicken is always so good!"}
{"text":"1/2 Chicken Dark Meat: Seasoned chicken from a Moroccan rotisserie was crisp and a bit salty for my taste on the outside, but the chicken on the inside was very juicy and tasted slightly sweet (the kind of sweet a meat naturally has, not like sugar). 

Hummus: texture is smooth, flavor is good, not heavy, not light, and a small amount of paprika is sprinkled on top

Pita: their pita bread does not come grilled and comes in small triangular strips.

Side Salad: diced cucumbers, a couple ripped pieces of lettuce, a Greek vinaigrette, and a Kalamata olive, just one... but tastes yummy.

Drinks: They have specially bottled sodas there as well as fountain drinks."}
{"text":"First time in...will definitely be back.
Mixed grill skewers with one lamb and one steak. Both perfectly cooked and tasty. Hummus and plenty of pita to last with everything ordered. 
Not a big falafel guy, but I tried the wife's and it was delicious, excellent seasoning made a fan out of this carnivore. 
Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I've honestly had better... But I'm not going to complain too much. We still enjoyed our experience here. We paid $30 for 2 meals and pita + hummus on the side. I think it's a good deal. But upon reading the reviews... Not everyone is too fond about the price point. 

Anyway, they serve you the food & even do refills on the pita bread if you run out. Which I thought was pretty awesome. The pita bread to hummus ratio was ehh. But that's why they do refills! And I was pretty excited about that.

I got a chicken pita. I thought it was pretty good. BUT it was burnt. It had that burnt taste all over it. Blegh! My boyfriend also said something about his tasting super burnt. So thumbs down on the cooking... But thumbs up for the pita bread and hummus.

It was clean-ish. We were outside so I can't tell you the cleanliness inside of the actual restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had the grilled chicken skewer for lunch.  Liked it so much that I had it for dinner.  Really tasty and juicy pieces of meat over a generous bed of couscous.  Comes with a tasty cucumber salad and warm chunks of roasted squash.  Also some delicious hummus with pita triangles.  Don't forget to ask for their homemade hot sauce.  Delicious!!  And great service!!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just walked up to the counter and tried to order. The girl behind the counter said \"Did you hear? All food is taking 45 minutes to come out. Would you like to order?\" Ummm - no! How can a pita take 45 minutes? It's 1 pm on a Monday and they weren't even full! No thanks."}
{"text":"I was in town square and couldn't decide where to go eat. A lot of places looked packed and not that many are kid friendly for my friends baby. We walked past here and wasn't busy so we said why not. Plus they had a kids menu.

I got a really good chicken rice bowl. The chicken was so flavorful and juicy and not over cooked at all. Rice was amazing and not bland at all. A feta and cucumber salad is served on it. So crisp and refreshing with the hot dish.
Hummus was on the plate with some olives. The hummus was great and the Pitas were hot. I ran out of some and still had some hummus left so the employee brought me some for no charge. Really nice of him.

The hummus and pita is really good for kids. It's healthy, delicious and fun for them to eat. I would defiantly come back here because the meal was better here than my last meal and experience at YardHouse.

Check this place out if you are in town square!!

Oh by the way their French Fries are bombbbb"}
{"text":"I really like this place!

Ordered the half chicken and the steak tenderloin skewer. The steak tenderloin was pretty good, but on the tough side. I wish it was a bit more tender. The chicken on the other hand was super juicy and it fell off the bone. I highly recommend the rotisserie chicken. The salad and hummus that they provided was pretty darn good. The pita bread was decent, but not the best that I have had. The couscous that came with the steak tenderloin skewer was nicely flavored. 

The service here was really good. They brought the food out and checked up on us several times to make sure that everything was okay."}
{"text":"Steak pita meat could have been more tender but the seasonings were good and so were the fries. Shady outside tables were nice too"}
{"text":"I would say great atmosphere average gyro good flavor lots of TVs and great for big groups obviously...."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time to get a Lamb Pita to go during my lunch break. Ordered my food at around 15 till 1pm and got my food about 15 after 1pm. This was after everyone who ordered after me got there food. It's a Friday during lunch time and the place isn't that big so when they realized I was the only one sitting there for half an hour with no food they realized something was wrong. I appreciated that they were very apologetic about it and got me my food right away....30 minutes later.

I understand mistakes happen and I wasn't too peeved about it until I actually opened up my to go box to dig in. My fries were cold, and my Pita was literally just thrown together probably in a matter of seconds. The lamb chunks were huge and over cooked and the pita was falling apart after one bite. I said screw the pita after two bites and ate the $11 I paid for the four large chucks of overdone lamb and a veggies. 

I'm all about first impressions to gain a re-visit and this location failed!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner one night since I was craving something healthy, close by, and quick.  The prices are a little higher for a fast casual type of food, but seeing that most of it healthy, I was okay with the extra few bucks being spent.  

I had the mediterranean salad and the people I was with had some mixed grills and salads as well.  We also tried some grape leaves and hummus.  We basically tried the entire menu so I got to try it all.  I though the best part was the pita bread itself and the lamb was very solid as well.  The spicy red sauce had a nice kick and tzatziki sauce was worth a go.  The salad and mixed grill wasn't anything special though.

The service was prompt (a little over 10 minutes for our entire meal), the waiters were friendly, and the ingredients were fresh.  However, with so many other better options in town, especially healthy ones, I will be trying others in the near future.  Not that I would never come back, but it tasted like a y other pita restaurant in Vegas and not worth the extra few dollars."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend while we were hanging out at Town Square.  It's a bit pricey, but the food is so good.  During my visit, I had an iced tea and lamb pita.  Ordering was quick and easy and food was delivered promptly. They also bus the table so you can rest easy and it's so awesome they have free wifi.  Don't forget to ask for taziki sauce with your pita!"}
{"text":"Had the lamb pita with grape leaves side, and both were excellent. The lamb was tender and the flavor of the marinade on the lamb was delicious. A little pricey ($17 including tip and drink), but well worth it."}
{"text":"I don't often give 5 stars, but this place truly deserves it. First I'll say their customer service is the best I've received anywhere. From the cashier, to the cook, and to the guy bringing out the food. So friendly and helpful. I always order the steak and chicken kabobs and they are big kabobs with a lot of meat. The rice is great and their pita bread is so warm and fresh. I can't say much about the hummus because I don't eat it, but my boyfriend said it's great as well."}
{"text":"Food is excellent fresh made , my son had lamb on the stick very taste . I had beef pita really good . This place is very clean , staff very friendly . Definitely will come back ."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Crazy Pita in Henderson, and I was excited to see that a new location was opening in my part of town. 

This Crazy Pita is tucked in the corner of the Town Square shopping center, across the way from Yard House. It's a very open and inviting space. The menu is posted on the wall behind the cashiers, and once you place your order and pay, they give you a number to place at your table where they will deliver your food. 

I ordered a chicken pita plate; it comes with a side of fries. My husband ordered a 2 skewer plate (one chicken, one beef), and once we received our dishes we began our feast. The pita bread is warm and soft, and the amount of chicken they give you is generous. They add a good helping of chopped veggies and some salad on top. My only concern with the pita was the meat and veggies were so juicy that it soaked my pita bread and made it difficult to eat towards the end. 

The french fries were shoe-string style, but they were just average as far as sides are concerned. Next time, I will pay the additional $0.99 to upgrade to another side. 

Will I be back to feast at this Crazy Pita? Yup, you bet! The food is excellent quality, the staff is friendly, and even though it's not the cheapest option in Town Square, it's certainly one of the most tasty!"}
{"text":"When I was visiting my friend a couple weeks ago, he brought me here for an inexpensive dinner.

I had the chicken skewer plate and everything was wonderfully tasty!

Where do I start? The chicken kebab was tender, juicy and flavorful. The warm pita was so soft and fresh. The hummus was amazing! The couscous was awesome and the cucumber salad was refreshing. I finished everything on my plate. 

In my opinion, the chicken here was way better than what I would get a place like Zankou here in LA."}
{"text":"Crazy Pita at the District. They have a lot of tables inside and outside. Of course if its 100 degrees outside we recommend not sitting or eating on the iron chairs & tables. They have a few TV's in the place and for the most part they have it on ESPN (its a plus in my book).

I am not a Greek food connoisseur...but I loved CP's Kefta & steak skewer combo plate. Kefta is spiced ground beef...theirs had a little kick to it, very tasty. The steak was also good and tender...i've had a lot of steak cooked to a point of calling it beef jerky. They serve their plates with couscous with sauteed veggies, hummus with bread, and a Feta salad. All this for  $11.95...I thought it was worth it because of the flavors and I always have extra to bring home to munch on later. They also have freshly brewed Shangri La Iced Tea....which I think is one of the best tasting iced teas out there. My wife likes their chicken skewer plate. I had a bite and its very tasty and cooked just right. A friend had the steak pita and its her favorite and always gets it.

We have always had good service and the owner/ store mgr. always comes around and chats up everyone. Its not a fast food joint so don't think you'll get your order right away. The grilled food takes some time but its a reasonable wait. It gets crowded during lunch time, so make sure you have some time to spare."}
{"text":"Poorly maintained the high tech Coke Machine.  It would not work for me, then an employee came up and pressed the exact same buttons I did and it worked.  Made me look like a fool.
They put finely diced cucumbers in everything.  I cant digest them so I paid for it that evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I first came to Crazy Pita in March 2015 because of the lack of organization of another restaurant up the block. At the end of our first visit, we explained to the manager the awful experience we had at the other restaurant, that after we ordered and waited, we cancelled everything as we observed other restaurant goers getting their drinks 15 minutes later. My husband had complimented the Crazy Pita staff and thanked them for their hospitality that the manager was so kind to give us a free slice of baklava. The $20/20% tip we would've left at the other restaurant, we dropped Into the tip jar at Crazy Pita instead. They certainly deserved it.

#1 reason we will continue to return to this location is the exceptional customer service. 

And the food is good too. The shrimp gyro initially looks plain, but there's a lot of shrimp in there. It's healthy too. At $8.95 for a shrimp dish, very reasonable."}
{"text":"It's nicer looking inside than nearby Mannas but hardly more impressive. It has quite a franchise feel-- despite the fact that its the only location -- I think. Their steak pitas are tasty and loaded with diced veggies. The fries are OK. I do see myself coming back again the next time I need something fast, as its obviously a much better than some random corporate burger joint. I haven't really felt the urge lately though so I guess we'll hafta see when that time comes. If you like middle eastern themed food and are sick and tired of subway and burgers and greasy mexican fastfood, I would recommend this place as a tastier alternative."}
{"text":"The food and service here are always spot on. Fresh, fast, and oh so tasty. The owner was at the restaurant when we were there and he was so amazingly nice and hospitable.  
A family favorite for sure."}
{"text":"There are so many places to eat at Town Square, but do not pass this place. Good food, really nice workers. The male cashier was super!"}
{"text":"Always the best bang for your buck especially with half off second entree. Chicken is always good along with the humus which is so healthy. Help yourself ice teas. Best place for dinner on a budget."}
{"text":"Really great food and the staff was really helpful. My husband and I both got salads with chicken skewers. Both were delicious. The pitas are fresh and soft. Already planning what to have next time."}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is by far the best place to get a quick bite in the District. Unique, delicious food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"The food is great, very delicious and fresh. Everyone is very nice. Excellent customer service. Kid friendly, always our go to after shopping."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a quick lunch and got the lamb pita which surprisingly came with French fries and ketchup and instead of something Mediterranean like pita and hummus (was craving that, but was not included with the pita). The lamb was decent but it was kind of frustrating to eat because the pieces were big round chunks instead of thin slices which would make eating much easier. Basically instead of getting a small bite of meat and pita, I had to chew on the whole ball of meat because it was hard  and tough. The fries were nice and crispy, but you can definitely tell it was the kind you can buy in the frozen section of the store. My meal was about $9-10 which would be okay if I wasn't still hungry afterwards. My friends were also still hungry and decided to get some dessert after to fill up their stomachs. I would probably go here again if I was really craving a pita and was not too hungry. If not, I just go to a different place. You are at Town Square so there are many other selections!"}
{"text":"I've always loved crazy pita, I use to go to the green valley location all the time. Today I decided to try this location out....I ordered the lamb pita and it definitely did not taste like the one at green valley. I feel like the recipe at this location is kinda off... I did not enjoy it. Other than that the staffs were very friendly.."}
{"text":"I am a fan..for the Lamb Shank at Crazy Pita!  They only have this on weekends I believe.  Why?  Because it was braised for hours and hours in order for it to be so tender that the meat just falls off the bone.  I even get to eat the marrow from the lamb shank.  This is serve with a side of hummus, salad, and warm pieces of pita.  

I tried the falafel pita with a side of babaganoush and pita.  I had better falafel elsewhere, but the babaganoush was packed with flavors.

I like it here because there are seats outside for you to sit if you bring along your pet friend.

Will I be coming back?  Heck Yeah!!!"}
{"text":"Yum. Great lamb skewers and very nice staff. Patrick helped me and told about the restaurant since it was my first. Will visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I kind of wavered between three stars and four stars, because the good thing was really good, but the rest was so mediocre. 

I had the kefta platter with couscous, vegetables, salad, bread, and hummus.  The kefta and the salad were fantastic. The hummus and pita were pretty good. The vegetables were not great, because they were underseasoned and mushy.  The couscous was also on the bland side.  

The had friendly service, and remarkably low prices. I would definitely go back and get the kefta. I wonder if they have rice instead of couscous."}
{"text":"We love Crazy Pita !!!!  The food is great and the staff there at downtown Summerlin is awesome. Also Hector is a super guy he has great customer service and really cares, My husband and l recommend this place, Thank you Crazy Pita."}
{"text":"I had had a sort of \"meh\" day, the kinda day where customer service everywhere you go is subpar. I decided to treat myself to lunch at crazy pita, and it was my first time there. The second I walked in I was greeted by a man, who might have been the manager with such a friendly smile and just a good vibe! I was instantly in a better mood. The restaurant smelled amazing, was extremely clean (and I noticed employees running around cleaning too) and the food was some of the best Greek food I've ever had!! I got the chicken pita (amazing) with eggplant dip (delish!!) and the baklava for dessert (so so good!!) I highly recommend crazy pita and can't wait to go back! They truly turned my day around with their hospitality and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Very friendly customer service. Only thing that bothered me were the kids meal prices, a bit expensive if you want to upgrade from the French fries to something more wholesome (pita & hummus, salads, etc). Either way, we all loved the food & will return!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Crazy Pita.  The food is great, the menu is well done and the service is fantastic.  This is my go to lunch spot in The District.   The chicken pita is my favorite."}
{"text":"The shrimp skewers are the absolutely best. Each skewer plate comes with their own hummus, feta salad, and vegetable couscous. They also give u as much pita bread as you'll like and it's fresh out the oven every single time. Good food, fair price, and clean environment"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect with their Pitas, but after eating their chicken pita, I feel like their food is somewhat Americanized Mediterranean food.

Don't get me wrong, the food was good, customer service was great, & prices were reasonable. BUT, I like strong & flavorful tasting food (especially when it comes to Mediterranean). 

The chicken was too charred tasting (not my fav) & only after adding the tzatziki sauce did I start to enjoy my pita.

Despite this, the customer service was superb & I'd definitely come back to give it another shot as I'm curious how their lamb pita tastes!"}
{"text":"It's pita time.  

Last time I order the chicken it was yellow and it was okay.  Order the fries extra ranch"}
{"text":"If you're in Downtown Summerlin and need a quick fix of food, and are in the craving for some Greek - Wait. For the price you pay, you get a small portion of meat, and it's mediocre at best. If I am going to be paying these prices, I want to make sure it's good Greek/Mediterranean food! I don't eat when my friends come here. I always end up either eating before or going somewhere else in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Delicious menu, nice outdoor seating and very friendly staff. They also have interesting beer choices."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I wouldn't feel bad eating after a 60-min session of hot yoga (which I don't do or anything). The kind where I'll eat every crumb, and ask for your leftovers... Did I stutter?

PROS
+ conveniently located in Town Square 
+ great price! $8.99 for a steak bowl (includes saffron rice, feta salad, hummus and pita) 
+ tender steak and fresh ingredients
+ friendly staff

CONS
- nope

TAKEAWAYS
* go again; Crazy Pita and Parsleys are definitely my favorite (fast) Mediterranean spots in the area!"}
{"text":"Best thing about the place is the roasted chicken, Ive had better . The sides are nothing to write home about. Hummus is awful watery and tastes like its from a can and the feta salad needs help too...."}
{"text":"I love Greek food. Out of all the places I have tried here in Las Vegas this one is my favorite. The dolmas are perfectly wrapped and served with a delicious dipping sauce. The lamb is seasoned just right. The hummus is enjoyable. As for the pita bread, they make sure you get more than enough. It is soft, slightly sweet, and delectable. I usually don't eat much of the pita bread at most places. Here I ate it all."}
{"text":"I love me some Falafel. I eat falafel on a weekly basis and it never gets old. I am used to having my falafel sandwich coming in lavash then grilled and crispy on the outside. The Falafel at Crazy Pita comes on a pita rolled like a taco. It was also a little pricier than I usually spend for a falafel back home. $8.05 including tax. 

Inside are a couple of falafel patties which are well seasoned, hummus, roasted red peppers, and cucumber tomato salad. These were all good and fresh , but when piled in your pita, it is quite messy. I thought the whole time, I wish this was in a lavash or a combo platter. Don't get me wrong the pita was soft and delish, but all over my hands and shirt sleeves. I also wish they had a spicy sauce they could put on the pita to give a little kick instead of just having Cholula which is not the flavor I wanted.

Overall, I would come back for a falafel sandwich here since it satisfied  my craving. I will also be trying to find that elusive 5 star falafel nearby, stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Ok, Ive been to the town square location and wasn't to impressed. But the down town summerlin location was different. Food was fresh and the customer service is amazing. Jasmine was very polite and nice. She let us try the new rice dish and gave me suggestions for the next time I go to here. It seemed that she really enjoyed working there, which is all ways pleasant to see. Especially for a fast food style of restaurant. I would definitely eat there again, because of the food and customer service."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times staff is always friendly and smiling. Had the chicken skewer and a piece of chicken was hard and not edible. Let the manager know and I wasn't expecting them to make me another cause I ate almost the whole thing but they did make me a fresh one. This place is great."}
{"text":"Mark is a great member to your team, thanks for the great customer service! We ordered 3 dishes and everything was devoured."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a chain. Definitely\"Americanized\". Nice patio in downtown summerlin location. Definitely not authentic Greek though...for that i strongly suggest Yassou's but for a fairly healthy, reasonably priced meal Crazy Pita is not a bad option."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the food. Ordered the chicken and steak skewer combos and falafel bowl. Couscous had no flavor, vegetables were bland, hummous was a bit watery and the pita was a little chewy.  Feta salad really had no flavor even with their dressing. The meat was ok. Falafel bowl had only 2 flat flavorless falafels. Side tzikiki and hot sauce were mediocre. Price point is fine if the food had flavor. Everything was bland so my family barely ate any of it except the chicken and beef skewers and unfortunately, we were hungry . We didnt even finish the hummous and usually hummous is gone! We love Mediterranean food and unfortunately a lot of the yelpers got this one wrong, in my opinion. Oh well.  
Gave an additional star for the cashier- good customer service skills!"}
{"text":"FRESH! TASTY!!
Super clean place. Very courteous cashier and server.
 I ordered the braised lamb Crazy Pita bowl and loved it. Comes with hummus, salad, rice and pita bread. The lamb was exquisite. Perfectly cooked and not greasy like other places. Tasty and moist
We also ordered the chicken and salmon skewers with salad, both seasoned perfectly , both delicious!
Pita bread is served warm and both the cucumber and regular salads were very good.
I wish i would  have taken pictures but i ate my food too quickly!!

UPDATE: picture i posted is from new order. Yes! Im back! Is THAT good"}
{"text":"Had the fallafel and hummus side. It was the perfect amount of food for a light lunch at a good price.  They also didn't even charge for extra pita pieces. The staff was incredibly friendly and the facility was clean.  They also had very fast and free WiFi."}
{"text":"I was expecting two skewers for the plate but was surprisingly full at the end. The steak is tender and flavorful. I love when you can order how you want it cooked. I hate when places have them pre cooked and it's usually dry at the end. This is not one of them!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Crazy Pita, but this particular location has a poor history of attention to detail.  At 6:45PM on 11/24/2017, I ordered a steak pita to go.  I asked for no cucumbers and no onions.  The wait was extensive but not a huge issue.  My food was packaged to go and I left without checking if the cucumbers and onions were left off the food despite having had them mess up my order before.  When I got home and checked, it looked like there were extra cucumbers on the pita!!  There were so many that I gave up and threw it in the trash.  It smelled like a pile of cucumbers.  I attached a photo so you can judge for yourself."}
{"text":"So IDK how this place can get 4 stars. It must be location, because it's not even remotely close to traditional Greek cuisine. I think one review said its like the Panda Express for Greek food. The Tzatziki is basically just sour cream. The fries are basically low quality Mc Donald's. And the price oh jeez! $13 for a pita wrap fries and soda please! The only good thing was the free soda refills and the cute server."}
{"text":"One year later, still great food and service. When the wife and I choose a restaurant to eat at this is the place. Consistent service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I had the lamb pita sandwich. The food tasted pretty good, but the serving was not very generous for the premium pricing. There were plenty of flies which brought the score down. The service was fast and friendly. Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Quite a taste bud pleaser here. Sampled the beef and shrimp skewers, the couscous, the chicken pita and the homemade hot sauce. All were very tasty and quality ingredients. Hummus was a little too thin for my tastes, but the flavor was okay as were the soft pita slices they give you to go with. I really liked the chicken though, probably my favorite thing so far. The house made hot sauce was really good too, kind like sambal olek style, and a good kick to it."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in town! Perfectly cooked meats with tons of flavor. Excellent combos. All at reasonable prices. Plus the owner is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and helps support the Josh Stevens foundation.  https://www.facebook.com/JoshStevensFoundation"}
{"text":"I do not write positive feedback on yelp usually, unless there is an out of the ordinary outlier.  This restaurant far exceeded anything expected.  On the outside this place looks like a franchise fast food pita pit style restaurant, nothing special.  Once I entered I was immediately impressed by the outstanding customer service.  There are only a few places that have really stuck out in terms of customer service in my life.  Two of those experiences have been at this establishment.  The food is incredible.  Many options for type of meat, and the two I have tried were exceptional.  I would recommend to build your own pita with kefta or braised lamb meat!  Both of which, were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Highly recommend if you're at town center."}
{"text":"Had the kafta kabob fr om town square. Good recipe. My hubby had the steak with a whole wheat pita. Only reason no 5 star is they were not busy but they were so slow."}
{"text":"The customer service here is beyond great. Makes you wanna come back for sure. Food is good, little pricey for fast food but i really think the way they treat tbeir customers is worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"#MezzaSalad YUM!! This plate is delicious and let me filled without feeling stuffed. It's filled with things I love: hummus, eggplant (babaganoush,) cucumber salad, feta, roasted red peppers. I love the tangy feta and the cool cucumber salad together, and the fact that the pita is warm when they serve it. The cashier on Saturday took our order with a sweet smile & attitude and even checked up on us later. Great meal, good experience, I will definitely be back if looking to fortify myself before or after shopping or a movie."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken skewers plate. They messed up, forgot about our order leaving us waiting for about 25 minutes. I must say the chicken was very good well seasoned but the cous cous and vegetables were overcooked, slimy and gross. The salad and hummus were eatable but not very appetizing. Ultimately we would of been better off flushing $22 dollars down the toilet."}
{"text":"food is really just ok. they must improve otherwise when other restaurants open at Downtown Summerlin it would be hard for them to survive..."}
{"text":"For fast food this place is pretty good. I have been here a few times. Had the chicken kabob with the couscous. The chicken was nice and moist as was the couscous. Would definitely go back when I'm in the area and try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Located next to Pot Liquor, Crazy Pita is a convenient place to stop for a bite if you're shopping in Town Square.  This is a counter order, get a number type of establishment.  The space is clean and fairly large.  Their pricing is similar to other Mediterranean style quick serve restaurants and their menu has lots of options, including individual bottled wines.  

I found that the meat on the tenderloin Skewer plate was seasoned and cooked nicely, but was not as tender as Stephano's.  The hummus, pita, and feta salad were good, but the couscous was incredibly bland and the Tzatziki had the taste and thick consistently of brick cream cheese, not yogurt.  It was also quite bland.  

3 stars for the quick service, Freestyle Coke machine, and most of the food I tried."}
{"text":"Great place to get falafel, pita or salad.  Vegas are always fresh.  Love the chicken pita.  I love that you can get a salad as a side instead of fries.  Wish more places gave you that option."}
{"text":"We were looking for a cheap lunch near the Green Valley Resort area, and stumbled upon this fast food style Mediterranean place. It is located in the shopping center near a Ben & Jerry's.

Food: We ordered the basic beef pita sandwich, lamb kebob platter, and one more dish to share family style between 5 people. We were only looking for a light dinner since we were planning on getting dessert later, so it was enough food if you include the hummus, extra pita, and sides. The meat was a little too salty for my taste. The pita was warm and very soft, and the hummus was decent. They gave out extra cups of taziki sauce, which looked mostly like mayo to me. 

The food took longer than I thought it would to come out, but the ladies running the cashier were very nice and brought us utensils and extra pita slices.

Okay place to stop for dinner, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how we had never been to one of these before. 

The menu was clear and not cluttered by too many things, which was refreshing. I liked that you had options hen it came to what type of carb they provided you with. I have to eat gluten free which proves to be difficult in many places - this wasn't one of those places. 

The mediterranean salad was absolutely delicious, and will definitely be consumed in more than one occasion. Crisp romaine, tomatoes, red peppers, artichokes, briney black olives and cucumbers - a perfect balance. No delightful pita for me, though :(

The staff was attentive and noticed in their own that they forgot my husbands side of fries - brought them over immediately. 

Was kind of creeped out for a minute by the manager standing there literally watching me eat - but remedied the situation by stating him in the eyes with every bite I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Lamb and steak was too tough to chew. Disappointed they don't even have gyro! What happen to the rice. Ugh will not be going back"}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday for lunch/dinner.  With the Las Vegas Film Festival, I have to eat early so I can get to as many screenings as possible.

I ordered the lamb pita with fries.  When I made a bit of a face when the gentleman mentioned fries, he said I could get any of their sides instead of fries for a small upcharge of $.99.  I went with the falafel side.  I also ordered and iced tea.  

Taking a number and putting it on my table, I first got my iced tea and then after a short wait, my sandwich came.  The lamb was tender and there was a good amount of lamb in the pita wrap.  The falafel were just OK.  There was standard hummus with the falafel and some extra pita slices were on the side.

Everyone in the place was super nice.  The food was served in a decent amount of time and it was good.  I think it's a little on the high end price side given what you get.

I looked at their kebab dishes that some other people had gotten and I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough for dinner if I came here for take out.  I'm glad I checked that out.

I guess I'd come back but I'm not sure.  I can get a great sandwich at the theatre for the same price and sit in a reclining chair."}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is fresh quick healthy tasty food! I have had almost everything on the menu. My favorites are the chicken skewers which are very tasty! Also I enjoy the steak pita. The meat is perfectly seasoned and never dry. Also the owners and managers treat you like family. I would recommend crazy pita the food is fresh healthy and never is disappointing."}
{"text":"Do not try the felafel it's not cooked , entire felafel is uncooked all dough!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at the quality of my food. For $8 I waited 10 minutes for old fries and a mediocre falafal pita. The pita was nice and soft and the chopped cucumbers were a nice touch."}
{"text":"I work for a large construction company and we cater almost everyday, these last two days I have arranged Crazy Pita to cater our lunch and it has been one of THE BEST experiences I have had with catering. From the time that I call and place the order to the time they deliver it the next day, I just couldn't be more pleased with this place. They are always on time, never forget anything I order, the delivery guy (I wish I could remember his name) was so incredibly nice and extremely helpful with setting everything up, and they even knew me by name when I called. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Everyone here in the office asked me where I ordered lunch from because the food was that good and asked if I would order from there more oftern. GREAT JOB CRAZY PITA! -From everyone at Southland Industries"}
{"text":"Lunch on the patio on a beautiful spring afternoon! 

I ordered the steak pita sans tomatoes of course. The pita bread was delightful; fluffily, warm, slightly chewy. The steak was served in big chunks, seasoned well and even served at a pleasant medium doneness. The pita also contained chunks of cucumber, sliced red onion, purple olives, feta crumbles and a creamy eggplant spread. I was immensely pleased with my pita. It was messy to eat with tasty juices dripping out. Delicious. It was served with well seasoned crispy fries and ketchup. Nothing needed additional seasoning. 

I left felling satiated but still light with a spring in my step. Definitely recommended for a lovely lunch when ravenous from a daunting afternoon of shopping! 

Steak pita, fries, and drink $11.29. Reasonable price for a fresh quality lunch."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Crazy Pita and it was beyond yummy . The staff was very nice and sweet and the food was delicious ! We are also excited they sell Be Kind gear as we support the Josh Foundation too! Keep up the great work guys we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all of the 4 and 5 star ratings.  I had lunch at the Town Square location a few years ago and I wasn't impressed at all so I forgot about it.  So when my boyfriend and I went to DS and got hungry, a pita sounded like a healthy option so we went there.  The restaurant is clean and the food looks good in the photos.  We both ordered the chicken pita, he ordered a side salad and I ordered a side of fries.  It took a while, probably about 20 minutes to get the food so I thought it would be fresh and hot.  Instead, the pita was lukewarm.  The chicken in the pita was flavorless and dry and the veggies in the pita were watery.  The whole sandwich was a mess.  This is what reminded me that I'd been there before, because you have to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork.  The fries were a very small portion, probably were frozen not fresh, although I have had better frozen fries at home because at least they were hot.  My bf's salad was pretty much the same veggies they put on the sandwich.  I will remember that I didn't care for this place the next time I run into it."}
{"text":"The best Middle Eastern food in Nevada. Love it. Me my cousin & daughter went there to eat tonight & they have excellent food & excellent service. I will be going back. Yummy"}
{"text":"Great food. Never had a bad meal there. Staff is friendly and run things smoothly. Have been going there ever since they first opened."}
{"text":"Food is great! Definitely worth the wait. I'd rather wait to have good food cooked correctly.  Just remember that Mediterranean food can't be done right in 5 minutes.  Just wait it out, we'll worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's a healthy fast food joint.  How can I give it 5 stars???  I am kept up nights over this.  I'm still fretting over my score of 4 stars, but I'm doing it. My mind is made and, sorry CP, I'm awarding 4 stars and I can't tell you why I'm not giving you five; the food is excellent.

I've been twice now.  The first time I had the Mediterranean Salad with grilled chicken.  Amazing!  Crisp fresh veggies with perfectly spiced and succulent chicken breast.   Second trip I had the Tenderloin Pita.  How'd Rachel say it? \"Yummo!\"  I think that's what she says, if not, you know what I mean.  It was incredible.   Tender juicy steak, brilliant sauce, fresh veggies, the pita is wrapped in paper and foil to keep it as neat as possible.  It's served with fries, but you can replace it with a healthy side like cous cous, or salad, etc...for $7.95, it rocks.  It's filling, satisfying in so many ways and healthy.

I should give them five stars, huh?

Anyway, HIGHLY recommended.  HUGELY HIGHLY!

Chow!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Crazy Pita last night.  I was pleasantly surprised!  This little eatery is on the south side of The District just east of Lucille's.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly.  There is seating both inside and outside on the patio.  I had the shrimp pita with cucumber and tomato side salad.  Delicious!  I will definitely keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a hidden treasures here. Impressive set of flavors and skill in developing the taste of the dishes. Tried two pitas and they were excellent.  The ground beef Kefta pita is shockingly good with tasty seasoning.  Great light char on the outside and a medium to medium well on the inside. Juicy and full of flavor. 

This is my new lunch spot for Town Square. Try it.

I would change the fries that come with the pita. They are very basic and don't match the flavor quality of the pita. I think either some kind of seasoned fry would be good, with a bit more complexity.

I will get a side of humus next time."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way out of Vegas and was shocked at how delicious the food was. Get the rotisserie chicken and you won't be disappointed. You don't even need a knife. The vegetable couscous was unexpected also amazing. Solid hummus and cucumber salad and the hot sauce was superb! Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting fior this day to come in here and F&(&&ok!!! No chicken,really and it's dinner time too.  First timer and will never go back.  Oh BTW, when you come here ASK for receipt otherwise you're  waiting for nothing until they figure it out!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I love Crazy Pita and I frequent all three of the locations in town. This is truly a local business, with a trio of locations owned by one guy. All three have their strengths and weaknesses, but all three serve absolutely delicious food. 

If you're looking for healthy eats, this is your place. Sure, you can get a plate of french fries if you must, but the grilled skewers, Mediterranean vegetables, hummus with olive oil, Greek salad, and fluffy couscous are good for your body! My go-to here is the mixed skewer plate ($15) with chicken and shrimp. The plate comes with a hearty skewer of grilled chicken breast, a skewer of grilled shrimp, couscous with tasty veggies (including squash and zucchini), an amazing feta salad (topped with olives, chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta), and a little side of hummus with pita bread (white or whole wheat). 

The portions may be hearty but the prices certainly are hefty. I like to eat here before or after a movie and dinner for two with sodas runs a little over $40.00 with tax. That's almost as much as eating at a sit-down full service restaurant!

But as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for, and the food is seriously top notch. Quality ingredients make for a happy tummy. I've also noticed that the employees at all the locations are a cut above most fast food workers. Think In-N-Out quality employees.  

There are a couple of minor negatives, however. First, let's talk about the hummus. I know Crazy Pita probably has wants to have dumbed-down hummus that appeals to non adventurous eaters, but their version is pretty lame. It's also so watery and thin that it doesn't even taste like or resemble traditional hummus (I want thick hummus topped with olive oil)! They do provide a communal olive oil container by the soda machine, but it's low quality oil, or at least it tastes like it. Second, I really, really hate how when you place an order at the register and pay via credit card, the system automatically prompts you to add a tip. A tip? For what?! I despise how so many places are guilt tripping customers into tacking on 20% or more to reward a person for simply doing their job. I have to tip someone taking an order? No thanks.

Overall Crazy Pita is the tops. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Yes, it's expensive and can get pricey really quickly (if you order soda or sides). But give it a try, I know you'll love it!"}
{"text":"The falafel pita was good.  The fillings were decent and tasty.  I just wish the falafels were a little more crispy.  The pita itself was just okay though.  Tastes store bought and doesn't stand up to gyro bread.

I do want to try some of their other offerings though, will update when the time comes."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for the kabobs and Cous Cous.  They are very delicious.  The hummus is yummy too!  Can't go wrong if all the kids enjoy it.  Reasonably priced and you get a lot of food! Staff is always friendly and restaurant always clean."}
{"text":"great food and the staff is always super nice - I called in an order today and because of some mix up my order was delayed, but as soon as the manager found out (I'm guessing he is also the owner) He was super apologetic and immediately offered me vouchers for my next visit - very cool dude....."}
{"text":"Great little place for Middle Eastern food. Food is delicious, value is reasonable, setting is clean and casual, service is fast and efficient. Shout out to Marcus who greats you and treats customer's well, is engaged, polite and watchful, giving customers a run down on the menu and advising, if asked, about flavors, portions and extra deal.  He is an excellent representative for CPRG.    In it's class, this place is terrific.  If you want a fast but tasty and reasonably healthy meal, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. The chicken skewer was tender and juicy. The kefta pita was quite large- good flavor and the meat was flavorful and easy to eat...but it was pretty oily. My pita was leaking juice and oil. I didn't care for the falafel at all (I love falafel btw). The hummus was decent but almost runny... and the homemade hot sauce hade a nice kick to it but had a strong vinegar-like taste."}
{"text":"Great place to try when you're craving grilled chicken, steak or shrimp skewers. Temperature and texture of steak is delicious. Tender, not overly cooked. 

Convenient location at The District ~"}
{"text":"I'm so digging this place!!! I've tried their chicken and steak skewer dishes and they are absolutely amazing!

Everything is fresh and tastes great and is moderately priced. The staff is always friendly and they keep the place pretty clean.

So far I have no complaints and I hope it stays that way. I love the fact that they are open just a little bit later than the other restaurants in the mall.

Even though Yelp says that they are open till 9PM the fact is that they're open till 9:30PM at least on Friday's. 

Another great thing is that this place is literally less than 3 minutes away from my house, so if I'm ever graving some Mediterranean food then I know exactly where to go!

Perfect place, perfect location, great food and service... what more can you ask for?

2 thumbs way up for Crazy Pita!!! Woohoo!!!"}
{"text":"This is the First Time that I have tried this Place, and I am Not Disappointed! I Love it...  =)

Crazy Pita is Located in Town Square Shopping Mall on the Mandalay Bay Side of the Mall. Right Across from the I Heart Burgers Restaurant!

Before you Enter the Establishment, On Occasion, there may be a Worker Standing Outside the Doors, Handing Out Samples, and there is also an Outdoor Menu. 

The Establishment is Kept Very Clean, The Bathrooms are Only One Stall, but Again Very Clean! lol  There are Tables inside the Establishment, and I Believe Outdoor Seating as well...The Counter Persons are Very Well Mannered, Happy, and Friendly! If you didn't know what a Certain Item was, they would be Very Happy to Explain it to you, Like they did to Me! They Take your Order, Give You a Number & Ask You to Have a Seat while your Order is Being Made. As it is an Open Grill, You Can See How Your Order is Coming Along! 

The Food is Very Tasty.. I had the Shrimp Skewers, and it was a Tad Salty, but Very Good, the Couscous that the Shrimp Skewers were Laying on was Very Soft & Light! The Cucumber Feta Salad was also Very Fresh & Light! They also Add Hummus & some Hot Pita Bread to the Dish! Yummy...is all I gotta Say! 

**Again this is Based Solely on My First Visit to a Mediterranean Restaurant, I am Sure there are Others that May Be Just as Tasty as This One, but for a First Timer, I Really Enjoyed the Atmosphere here! 

One More Thing I Failed to Mention...They Do Have Free WiFi Connection!"}
{"text":"Yummy food served up fresh and quick. I tried the Chicken Skewer Plate. For $8.99  you get a chicken skewer (seasoned & grilled just right) , couscous (light & fluffy) with a variety of mixed squash (zucchini, kabocha & butternut) , cucumber feta salad (cool & refreshing), hummus (different than others I have tried but good) and pita bread (soft & warm). Restaurant is clean & cozy.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. I shared a plate with my boyfriend (2 skewers), and it was plenty for us. Definitely get tahini on the side and try some pita (it's so good!). The restaurant itself has a fast food atmosphere but the employees go out of their way to personally serve you food and do it with a smile."}
{"text":"Great, fresh, fast! Lamb pita and feta salad were amazing.  The lamb was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Second time here, this week. The mezza salad is delicious. And the added shrimp skewer tops it off! So refreshing, crisp, and yummy."}
{"text":"it's my second time going here and I tried other places and this is an ok spot. people are friendly and service is good, but not as flavorful to me compared to the other places I tried"}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had.  Friendly cashier and attentive staff that was happy to help.  Awesome food."}
{"text":"Nice little place to eat in Green Valley for a simple lunch. I ordered the shrimp pita with a side salad. Since it was beautiful outside, my sister and I sat on the outdoor patio area. It was nice to enjoy the sun and see everyone outside with their dogs. I had to resist the temptation to feed the little pups around me, but I was very happy to keep the shrimp pita to myself because it was delicious. I enjoyed the flavor combination of hummus, seasoned shrimp, and roasted red bell peppers."}
{"text":"When it comes to rotisserie chicken, I think this place is a great choice. GREAT marinade on their chicken, and I could probably stuff my face here once a week. 

The hummus was decent, and falafel was average. The combo family plate that comes with a whole chicken and sides is a great value meal. The service here has been amazing. A nice option for a healthy lunch during your shopping time!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to grab a quick bite if you're in a rush!! Try their bowls since the price is very reasonable and you get plenty of food, it comes with hummus, salad, rice and your choice of meat. They always ask if you want to try their hot sauce and I have to say it's very delicious, every meal comes with a big side of pita bread. Everything is almost delicious on their menu, but I recommend their beef option as it tastes so much better. They are very quick and you'll be out before you know it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better rating because the service was fantastic from start to finish - but to me it's all about the food. 

We got the kefta plate with hummus, vegetable cous cous, salad, and a side of falafel. Meat and falafel were dominated by cumin, which is not my favorite and ruined it for me. Salad lacked flavor and could have easily been brought to life with added vinegar or fresh lemon and salt. Get rid of the cous cous for rice. It was horribly dry and lackluster. Hummus was good. Tzatziki was horrible. Tastes like store bought onion dip. Highly suggest they google \"authentic tzatziki recipe\" and follow it.  It filled our bellies in between shopping but we won't be back. Some easy fixes could massively improve the flavor of most dishes. (I'm a food snob. I love good flavors. Sorry, not sorry.)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I come out to Henderson this is a must on my list! Food is always fresh and the taste is just out of this world everything on the menu is great you can't go wrong here. The bowls are perfect and are very filling! Not only is the food great but the staff here are always so friendly and welcoming if you haven't tried this place than you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 1/4 dark chicken. Lemon chicken and pita bread was pretty good. Hummus is a no-go though, it needed salt. I would go back again if I was around the area. Service was ok. Didn't seem as friendly as everyone says but it was also me and a gentleman in the restaurant, I don't blame them for being bored out of their minds and wanting to leave. Also 7.99 for all of this? Deal!"}
{"text":"Yum! The smell of the meet being grilled needs to be bottled up and sold as cologne! The staff is great even when the line is out the door, things seem to be on track and the food is amazing! I love the steak kabobs, and the humus is awesome too! Glad to see it close by my home! The pita bread is warm and fresh! Going to try some more things when I go back! Lunch is always packed get there before 1150 am!"}
{"text":"The food tastes ok, nothing special that jumps out at you as far as uniqueness of the food or the place. Service was good, price a little high for the quality. Other places in town serve same style food are better then this place at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was a little iffy after reading the bad reviews but-  this isn't the best Mediterranean food I've ever had but it still tastes really good. Hit the spot!  Good meat, fine hummus, pretty good lentil soup. 
Also good customer service. Nice cashier."}
{"text":"Very mediocre.  Coming from The Detroit area where we have fantastic authentic Mid Eastern food on almost every corner, I found this place sub par.   The Hummus was not thick and flavorful.  It was watery and bland.  When I asked for a side of Tahini for my Falafel, the waiter told me it was already in the Hummus (Duh, that's how you make hummus). The Israeli salad was ok but they call it something else. Don't see me going back.  Can't win em all!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here two months ago and I cannot stop coming back. They've opened my doors to other Mediterranean Food Places! I haven't gone a week without eating a Mediterranean dish. So in love with it. Must try the shrimp! The steaks a little salty but still yummy."}
{"text":"We tried the Falafel pita and lamb pita; the falafel was spicy, but not overly so, and overall tastes good. The lamb meat was soft; pretty good too. Both came with fries on the side, a little overdone. The servings were on the smaller side, and one of the plate sections was filled with ketchup; hummus would have been nicer and more authentic. Overall a good experience, not sure I would go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I work pretty close so I try to get here about once a week for lunch. They get pretty busy at lunch time so it isn't as quick as fast food, but they do call ahead ordering for those in a rush. I usually eat there just to get out of the office for awhile.

The service is really good. Every person working here is friendly and ready to help. They always ask if you need anything when they drop off food. I also find them to be very efficient at clearing tables when people leave which is key since they get so busy.

The food is really good, tasty and fresh. My favorite item is the steak tenderloin skewer plate. The steak is flavorful and tender. I love all of the sides that come with it as well. Their hummus is fresh and awesome with their homemade hot sauce on top. They also give you a nice variety of veggies on the plate like the grilled veggies in the couscous and the cucumber salad. You can't beat the price for so much healthy food that tastes great."}
{"text":"I love this spot and am so glad that I have one close to home. This location is stored in my phone for to go orders. Yes, they will take orders by phone so that it's ready when you arrive!

I always get the skewer plate, but I mix up the protein between visits. The skewer plate comes with cucumber salad, hummus, pita, and couscous with grilled vegetables. The steak tenderloin is my favorite option, but the shrimp is really good too. The chicken is good, but can be a little dry. I always ask for the homemade hot sauce and add that to the hummus for a nice kick. The standard plate comes with one skewer, but for those that like more meat you can add a second skewer. I find that the one skewer plate is more than enough food. 

Typically I order water, but they have really good teas that are fresh brewed so I'd recommend the tea. They offer a black iced tea and a green iced tea. 

Everyone that works here is always really friendly. They are friendly when they take my order over the phone and just as friendly when I arrive to pick up my food."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to the lack of casual/cheaper varieties at Town Square. We ordered a chicken plate and steak plate, which came with vegetable cous cous (squash & zucchini), hummus, pita bread, and cucumber salad.  Very tasty and filling, good portions, and healthier than the other options available. I was pleasantly surprised by the vegetable cous cous! Only downside I can see is that the wait times can probably get really long, especially during peak hours."}
{"text":"I've been to Crazy Pita twice now. I had the vegetable skewer the first time & the falafel platter the second time. We also had the dolmas. I loved the food. The service was good & the restaurant was very clean. I wish they had two fountain drink stations because I had to wait in line for a drink. They have the fancy coke machine that you can add flavor to. The prices are reasonable.  I will be going again."}
{"text":"Second visit for Kefta plate-
Veggie were amazing-
Hummus is perfect!
Staff is bonus- super nice and quick to clean-
Meal is so good I know I want to eat here and get a hungering for it before I even get there 
Quick service and open kitchen so you can see right it while they're cooking-
I like the choose your own soda machine and I'm beginning to see it more often so I'm cool with being able to switch between a ton of different drinks -been rockin the caffeine free sparkling water lately :)"}
{"text":"Decent spot for some quick Mediterranean food. 

Was pretty packed around 6 pm when we got in. Crowd started dispersing quickly after though. We got our food within 10 mins of ordering. 

Got the Crazy Pita Salad with added chicken. Salad was a great size and everything was chopped small and loaded with cucumbers! Made it very easy to eat. However, the chicken skewer was pretty overcooked, charred, and dry. Didn't really care for the feta cheese either. I'm not sure what kind they use, but it's not your typical crumbly variety. It's mushy and sticks together. Makes it very hard to put on your food if you get it on the side. Overall, everything was decent.


I love the pita here. Not your typical whole wheat hard and floury pita; it's more of a fluffy white bread. Comes out warm too, which was really nice. 

Key lime pie was amazing! Very very rich and fluffy, more like a mousse. 

Customer service was really great. They came by quite a few times to ask us how our meals were and to take empty plates and trash."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here several times but lately I am finding the chicken to be dry . Please fix this issue as its a good place to have lunch and I would love to return because I live nearby but there are several places I can choose from In DTS to have lunch.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Wow I am really surprised at the reviews here as I did not think Crazy Pita was that great. Being that I've been to quite a few Greek/Mediterranean places in Vegas I was kind of hesitant to try this place as it looked like a chain. I am not sure if they are or not, but regardless I was not impressed.

Crazy Pita is located in Downtown Summerlin, and is easy to get to as it is situated outside of the shops. You can easily park in the lot out front and walk right up to the restaurant with ease.

I ordered the Lamb Pita, which comes with french fries. But unfortunately, after I ordered I noticed you could switch to an alternative side, which I wish I had done.

I took my food to go and when I arrived back at work there was ketchup smeared all over the inside of my to go container - because they had put a bunch of ketchup in it for the fries. It was all over the fries, and yes, even on the pita. Yuck. I didn't really tip my container that much, but I guess when I swung it in the car is probably when the ketchup waterfall happened.

The pita itself was OK -- Paymon's is better. The lamb was all right, not the best, not the worst, and it was in BIG chunks inside the pita, which made it kind of messy to eat. I would have rather just had the lamb chunks on a plate. The fries were HORRIBLE. Don't know if they were previously frozen, but either way just completely lacking any flavor/spice/etc. 

Overall, doubt I would return. There are better places to get a pita in town."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times and it seems very monotone to me. I kept giving it the benefit of the doubt: maybe they had a new chef, maybe they forgot a spice, etc., because for the amount you're paying its pretty bland. It's \"okay\" food, but not worth the price. The Greek restaurant at the Galleria at Sunset mall is tastier and not to mention reasonably priced for the tasty food you're getting. The atmosphere and aura is nice, the employees are more solemn rather than upbeat and welcoming, and the food is okay. I'd spend my dollar here simply for the environment of The District, but even then it's not really worth it. You'd have better luck at the other restaurants there to be honest!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for a late lunch after playing in the park. We ordered with a lovely girl who got everything correct. We sat down and when one of the workers brought our food my son was a bit distressed because he didn't want to share fries from daddy's plate. Our server brought a small container of fries and ketchup for our 4 year old son which made him very happy! They really go above and beyond at this location! We are a returning customer and will continue to be one thanks to their awesome food and most importantly their amazing customer service!!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I continue to be wowed by Crazy Pita.  There's a few simple reason why I've been there three times in three weeks:

The food:  fresh, delicious, healthier than almost any other fast food place I can think of.  None of the meats or fish are dripping in sauce; they're simply marinated and skewered.  They serve a simple Mediterranean salad that's not drowning in dressing (but there's olive oil and a good balsamic vinegar available if you want more).  The hummus has tahini, lacking in so many other places.  They serve real veggies (butternut squash, zucchini and onions) atop a light and tasty couscous.  The pita is top-quality and doesn't dry out after it sits for more than a few minutes.  The falafel is very different - made to order, so you're not getting balls that have been sitting around and reheated.  They're also spicy, and are a mix of fava beans and chickpeas.  Fava beans are the traditional recipe, and most falafel in this country uses only chickpeas.  The authenticity of the food is even more commendable since the owner is from Honduras, not exactly a Mediterranean outpost!

The prices:  extremely reasonable.  If you order a 1-skewer platter, it may look like it's not a lot of food, but it fills the plate and is extremely filling.  And you've had dinner, with only a few exceptions, for 10 bucks or less.  But there are salads and pita sandwiches to choose from, too.

The service:  Food is delivered quickly, brought to your table by the friendliest and most engaging people I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  Hector and Patrick are exceptional.  When I returned for my third visit last night (Thursday), this time with my husband in tow for the first time, Hector remembered that I said I will always come Wednesday, and said he was disappointed when I didn't show.  Both of them check on the diners throughout their meals, and like to engage in conversation if you're up for it, but are also respectful if you're not.  That's how I've come to think of them as friends so quickly!  

They have an assortment of wine and, I think, beer (I don't drink beer).  I was able to choose from my favorite whites, which include Riesling and Prosecco.  Wine's half off during their 3-6 pm Happy Hour.

Until I need a break, Crazy Pita will continue to be my go-to Wednesday night place.  But now that hubby's a fan, too, we may have to adjust the nights here and there."}
{"text":"I go there 3 times a week. Always the best food. Always the friendliest staff. Very fast. Does not charge you for all the extras. Addictive!!!!! Love all the girls there. Be good to them. They take care is you!!!! Get a beer, or the best tropical tea ever!!!!  janine"}
{"text":"The crazy pita is a hidden treasure.  I LOVE the grilled chicken skewers.  They come with couscous, a yummy cucumber salad, squash, with pitas and fresh hummus.  YUM!!  It's a perfect meal when you're trying to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Very tasty pita, put in the hot fire dressing and feel like in Jerusalem. Clean place, fast service."}
{"text":"Ordered baba ghanoush and a falafel plate to go. 

Baba ghanoush was good and came w lots of warm pitas.  Falafel was good but only came w 3 falafels and a pile of couscous and squash. The couscous and squash was yummy but I would've liked slightly less of that and maybe another falafel or two. 

Overall the food is good...not the greatest Mediterranean food, but good. It's conveniently located and the price is decent. The store is clean and the staff is nice and fast. I'll def eat here again...hoping for another falafel"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Very helpful  and cheerful cashier and then the staff that brought out the food was very helpful. Always asking if we needed anything else. Was very impressed."}
{"text":"Love this place. My all-time favorite is the lamb pita. The hummus is excellent and the pita bread is nice and soft and fresh .i could eat here four days a week."}
{"text":"Excellent pita sandwiches! quick and fresh. I liked the Kafta. This place is similar to a few pita places in California. I highly recommend this place. Only thing I wish they baked their own pitas in house. Very good taste and ingredients."}
{"text":"Now i've never actually dined here, but my best friend always has brought hummus and greek salads to work a couple times and it has hit the spot. The cucumber salad is so good, especially mixed with their hot sauce!"}
{"text":"All I can say is yuck.  Great and all for having wheat pitas and lamb specials, but the menu isn't interesting and the food isn't either.  It is also cool that they have Republic of Tea bottles, but they are probably too expensive.

I never had a good meal here, and service is blah.  The sirloin sandwich with eggplant spread was okay, beef was chewy.  The mezza salad was just canned veggies thrown together.

My fries were cold though we waited awhile and were the only people in there at 4:30 PM, and my divided plate - one side dish was a huge blob of ketchup!  yuck.  I don't like condiments, but especially not all over my plate - put it on the side or at the self serve area by the drinks!

Eric decided to switch his order of fries to veggie couscous -the cashier could not ring up the cheaper side with the entree, so she gave it to him for free.  It was mushy veggies with the skins still on?? and couscous...more blah.

Uninspiring all around, not much better than its neighbor panera who is always out of things.  +1 for Shangri-La tropical iced tea."}
{"text":"Good fresh food and friendly service.  Very nice place to stop and get a quick bite while you are shopping.  They have one of those cool multi flavored Coke machines too!"}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern cuisine. Everything I have tried here has been outstanding. The Kafta, shish-kabob, chicken-kabob, falafel, and hummus were all very good. This place is in DTS, so like I always say about DTS - Your gonna pay a little more, but this place is worth it.

I would recommend that you try Crazy Pita."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and beef skeeters. It was very tasty and the portion was very good. We will dig finitely come back."}
{"text":"I loved the food at Crazy Pita and can't wait to go back and try something else.  I had a steak skewer and it was moist and delicious.  The hummus is very good, and the service and the workers are very helpful."}
{"text":"It seems pretty pricy for a lamb gyro and three falafels w/hummus I paid $20. I was expecting some quality to the food since the reviews were pretty decent, but it's not great. The lamb gyro has decent lamb but the cucumber lettuce and tomatoes were subpar. It's completely Americanized and I would rather eat at other Mediterranean places to eat gyros on the go. I pretty much only ate the meat and pita with hummus because everything else was soggy and lacked the flavor of a true gyro."}
{"text":"The food has a nasty after taste. I could not eat it all. It did not taste good either. Like too much liquid from the cucumbers or something. The food at this restaurant is not good like the other two restaurants here in Las Vegas, NV. I don't think they follow corporate recipe but do their own thing and this is my second time trying the food. The first time was when they first opened and I figured they just needed time to adjust but when I came yesterday to treat myself for mother's day, I was very disappointed. I won't be eating at this Crazy Pita in Summerlin (Sage Park Dr) any more. Something is definitely wrong with the taste. They are not as clean as the other two restaurants either."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food. It is my favorite category of food for 2 reasons: I like fresh food, and I love grilled things. Luckily for me, Crazy Pita has both. The food tastes super fresh and the amount of time it takes for food to come out of the kitchen is perfect: not too fast, so you know that your items were actually prepared for you, but not too slow so that you're able to grab a pretty quick bite to eat and not be in a time crunch. 

I usually order a plate which includes a skewer of meat or falafel, couscous with butternut squash and zucchini, a small Greek style salad, and a pita and hummus. It is a pretty perfect amount of food, sometimes even a bit too much, but the calorie count is about or a little below 500 for the plate. The best part is just how good everything tastes. The dressing on the salad is not too overpowering, the meats are all seasoned well (I more often than not pick a shrimp skewer, which is definitely my favorite of the skewers), and the hummus is some of my favorite hummus from anywhere. It's just so smooth and delicious. If you order something that doesn't come with the hummus, order it as a side, it's worth it.

The location for this restaurant is right next to the Ben and Jerry's, and not too far from Lucille's. The crazy pita has 15 minute parking spots right out front of it if you want to take your food to go (which is very useful as that parking lot can get crazy on the weekends).

I love coming here. It's a great spot for Mediterranean food and I will always recommend the awesome hummus."}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't rated this place yet.  It's a very unsuspecting place in Downtown Summerlin; just by looking at it, you'd think it would be about the same quality as Mad Greek or some other fast food mediterranean place, but it's SO much better.  

The quality of their kabobs is fantastic - lean meat, lots of flavor, good portions.  I generally get the Mediterranean salad with lamb or steak kabobs.  Recently, we tried the roast lamb - HOLY TASTY MEAT Kabob man!  If you've ever had slow-roasted lamb (or if, like me, your mom used to make it growing up), this is the good stuff.  I was highly impressed.  The tzatziki sauce is also much thicker than what you'd find at a typical gyro place.  

Oh - and their hot sauce is SO legit.  They make it in house and you can purchase it by the bottle.  Do it."}
{"text":"I've visited 2 Crazy Pita locations in the past week & loved both places, I just wish there were one closer to my home.  Prices are reasonable, great variety, and everything I've tried has been delicious. Fresh, flavorful - YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This is a casual restaurant where you order at the counter and food is brought to your table.  My wife ordered the chicken skewer plate and I ordered the lamb skewer.  Each came with vegetable cous cous, a small salad, hummus and pita bread.  The food was on the bland side with the meat overdone and dry. I saved a few dollars by using a coupon I found in the Zip Code Magazine.    
("}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after seeing all the of the great reviews.  Sadly I was disappointed.  I orderd the steak pita and my husband orderd the lamb.  My husband is a big eater and I don't often consider any complaints from him about portion size to be conclusive but in this case I was also underwhelmed.  Both pitas were far smaller than what we have received at other greek restaurants (Greek Bistro, Paymons) and the meat was not particularly flavorful or tender.  The pita itself was soggy in spite of not having a significant amount of vegetables or sauce.  The fries were actually the highlight of the meal but the portion size was very small.  I am not a fry person but I would say that the fries at both Greek Bistro and Paymons are far superior.  That said I would probably not eat here again."}
{"text":"Whether it's for a quick lunch or dinner to go, the menu is appealing to everyone. It's reasonably priced, everything is delicious and the best part - excellent customer service. 

This is a great place to get a healthier meal or indulge. I absolutely love going here for any reason. I'm a big fan of the lamb kabobs and French fries. Their tzatziki is awesome (and free) and i love their chili sauce. I just tried the braised lamb the other day in a bowl and it was so good with the cucumber feta salad, rice, and hummus. My coworkers love their pita wraps as well. 

Their service is always impeccable and they are always so kind. Always love going here and always feel welcomed. Plus, there's free delivery on orders over $50 if you're within a certain distance (awesome!)"}
{"text":"This place is super delicious and we never regret eating there by feeling yucky like a lot of \"fast food\" places make us feel. The customer service is awesome, the owner is super nice and it's SO clean. The hubs and I have gone once or twice a week for the past few weeks just out of sheer convenience. It's reasonably priced and the staff is great. They even come clean up after you! Another bonus is that it has that crazy million drink coke machine!"}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is located on the corner of Downtown Summerlin's outdoor mall and features several floor to ceiling windows, two large flatscreen TVs, and ample seating room. However, the food is less than stellar. 

I ordered a lamb pita and was told I couldn't get tzatziki sauce on my pita because they are served with hummus instead. My pita showed up with tzatziki sauce on the side and the employee then told me that they could have indeed put it on the pita. ?? 

Though I was confused, I dug in. Immediately I realized that the lamb is served in HUGE chunks that should be cut down to three or four smaller pieces (so watch out for that) and that most of the pita is full of cut up cucumbers (which tasted slightly odd). This pita would have been much better if I wasn't constantly cutting up lamb chunks and spreading tzatziki for every few bites, and if it was served with feta cheese!

I might try this location again but I probably wouldn't get the lamb."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i hate writing reviews. But this place is so worth the time. The staff is young and friendly! They will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Thats just the staff. The food is delicious! Fresh and affordable. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Great hearty meal at great prices. You order and then sit down with your number. They will bring you everything which I find is nice. I got a plate with the lamb, fries, and hummus. The pita bread was out of this world fantastic. I really enjoyed the lamb as well. It was A LOT of food. I got the plate and it honestly was enough for two people. The server was nice and got me what I requested for, and the cashier was friendly but not over the top friendly. Overall a casual dining experience great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Have never had a bad meal here...really like the side salad rather than the fries with the wraps.  Service is always great and staff friendly.  I'm a chicken pita wraps kinda guy and it never dissapoints...portions are good size too..."}
{"text":"I love this place! We eat here at least three times a month. My fiance loves the roasted 1/2 chicken and I absolutely love the Shrimp Pita or Mediterranean Salad with Shrimp. 

Its an inexpensive place where you can get a quick meal but a quality meal that is tasty and healthy.. The food doesn't taste processed and its yummy..  

They have the best service and the owner is extremely accommodating. We have catered with them before and they give you a lot of food for what you pay for. 

Overall one of our favorite places to dine at when we are short on time.."}
{"text":"Default healthy dinner out spot.

Chicken, steak or shrimp skewer plates with hummus and pita bread (whole wheat on request) and cucumber feta salad is my go to.

Also the Mediterranean salad with 2 skewers, or falafel are great here.

Little off menu gem, ask for a side of fries with feta and a lemon wedge. DELISH. 

I enjoy knowing my meat is grilled to order right in front of me, not sitting under any type of warmer.

Overall, great casual lunch or dinner spot with the family."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Delicious food! So glad I stopped here and customer service was friendly. Highly recommend this place. A+"}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  The steak skewers are great, better than the chicken. If you get a plate it's worth the price since it comes with a feta cucumber salad, hummus and slices of pita bread, cous cous with squash,  and the steak."}
{"text":"Owner is in the restaurant, greeting customers. I'm glad to ser this for a change. Skewers and the Moroccon red chilli sauce was very good."}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive, taste, and friendly fresh fast service. 
This place is a great place for a light no guilt meal. The prices are very reasonable, and the service seems as if its family run."}
{"text":"First time here, not exactly sure if I will return. The District has few great choices for good food but this place was pretty good. Had the Chicken Pita and it was great. Loved how moist the chicken was and the fresh greens inside were awesome. All pita's come with fries. I will say I kinda prefer Pita Pit since you can build your own and add whatever you want. I thought this place was rather pricey. For $1 more you can go to a Mediterranean place and sit restaurant style."}
{"text":"After hiking with our two pups at Red Rock, the hubs and I needed some chow. We found Crazy Pita on Yelp and could not have been happier with the service. It was a beautiful day, so we sat outside and the four-legged children joined us. Everything was top-notch as far as the food was concerned. I had falafel and my husband had a steak kabob. The hummus was delicious and the pita fresh. I LOVE the cucumber salad!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice now. Every bit as good as the original locations. Yes, it's busy people. There are like 3 restaurants in a new complex that the entire LV area is scoping out. Settle... Food is fresh and the service has been friendly despite the busy environment."}
{"text":"This place is WAY under rated. Surprisingly delicious because it looks like a semi-fast food place. I have tried the Pita Sandwiches and the Rice Bowls and they are both great. Don't forget to ask for a side of hot sauce because it is amazing."}
{"text":"We dined here today. Not impressed at all!   We love Mediterranean food, especially kabobs or pitas.  We got the kabob platers. While the chicken and shrimp kabobs were pretty good the rest of the platter was terrible!  The veggies were soggy and mushy and couscous had zero flavor.  The hummus was on the runny side and the cucumber salad was nothing to write home about.   It was busy but I think that's gonna change once more restaurants open in the mall.  Also the prices were super high for what you get. We could go to Khoury's and get awesome kabob meals for the same price."}
{"text":"Yummmm!! My favorite from when I worked in Green Valley. So glad they have one on the west side. Healthy, yummy, affordable Mediterranean food!!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that this place is in a little trendy part of Henderson, and that there are power-luchers everywhere enjoying thei meals, I didn't care much for the place. I am all about eating a yummy kefta, I have even perfected the act of making them at home. When my order came out everything looked great. I was so excited to dig in! But I have to say, the flavors fell short....or maybe there were too many flavors. Can that even happen? Well, the flavors were not really spicy, per se, but there were so many in the beef kefta that I was over-whelmed. I was burping up my food until I went to bed that night. Not fun."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken pita and feta salad. Great good, great service, clean and very friendly spot & reasonable prices. Will definitely become a regular here."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service has been consistently pleasant.  The soda  machine was not working on one visit, but they were nice enough to get up on a chair and get me some ice out of the hopper for tea.  I wish they offered dolmas (hot version of stuffed grape leaves with beef or lamb).  A tad pricey for the portions, but happy to have lamb options."}
{"text":"Love the food, friendly, attentive staff and atmosphere! Great place for lunch or relaxing dinner with wine."}
{"text":"On our way back to LA and needed something to grub on before the traffic drive home. Saw the yelp review on the other place but wanted to check this one out because it's on Las Vegas Blvd. 

Really good food and a really friendly staff. This is located in the Town Square plaza. Had the 1/2 chicken and chicken kabob. Very flavorful and savory. Was our first time and staff was more than happy to help us and answer any of our questions. Pita bread is nice and hot! Hummus is delicious and so is the couscous. Another plus is that they have a very advanced digital coke machine. Plenty of choices to choose from. They also serve beer! Nice flat screen tvs on each other. Really can't find anything to complain about. LOL. Who normally leaves tip in a dine-in type fast food joint? Nobody! But they earned/deserved it from our party."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about this little restaurant was how clean and sparkly everything is. I like how bright and cheery it is inside.  You order from the cashier and then you find a table and they bring your food to you.  They also clear your table, so it's kind of a combination of sit-down and self-serve.

I had never been here before so I wanted to browse the menu a bit, but it was slow when we went in so the cashier was just waiting on us to place our order. I felt a bit pressured and rushed so I just ordered the lamb pita with a side of French fries. I was expecting something like a gyro, where the meat is shaved or at least in thin slices, but it was actually kind of large chunks of meat in the pita, making it impossible to eat.  It was really delicious and the meat was tender, but with veggies and sauce spilling all over my hands, the table, my plate as I tried not to get whole giant chunks of meat in one bite, I ended up having to eat most of it with a fork and knife. I think smaller chunks of meat would have helped tremendously.

My friend ordered the combo skewers and she got chicken and steak. YUM!!!  This combo came with hummus, rice and veggies.  The beef was very flavorful and tender.  The chicken was good but just slightly on the dry side.

Overall, I really liked it and will definitely add this into my lunch rotation. Next time I want to try the beef patties!"}
{"text":"Very clean and nice restaurant. Quick and friendly service. My wife had the chicken pita wrap which she loved and I had the steak and lamb kabob, also pretty good. We will Defin be back."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  I am a huge fan of mediterranean food and this place was quite nice! 

a.  Ambiance / location- 5 star - located in the Green Valley District, it is cozy, boutique-ish and very nice.

b.  Price - 4 star - Mostly everything is under 10.00 and like 7.95 to 9.95.  Comes with Extras like Hummus, feta salad and couscous, so generally beside the salads, a full meal. 

c.  Service -  3 star - I am quite shocked that this place had a Gallaria Food court style service. It is just like Cafe Rio and Roberto's.  You go to a counter and order food, get the drinks, get a numbered tent card, wait at a table and then the food comes out in plastic.  The people there are 5 star based on their limited requirements, the style of service for such great food is more fast food like and this does not do justice to the food itself. It takes away from the experience vs. adding to the experience.

d.  Charity - 5 star - The place is a mecca for the \"be kind\" movement and this is to me both admirable in its charity and inspiring in it's leadership. I love coming to places that support the community and in this regard, plus the great style of food, I am coming back for sure!

e.  Take Out - 4 star - Everything is available to order, take home. Packaging is perfect and all is just right. They even have gift cards and all. This is great.

GK says,  check it out.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Delicious pitas, hummus and salads! I have visited the restaurant twice and have enjoyed the food both times. Unfortunately, there is always a long wait so I just order the food to go. I look forward to eating in the next time. If you're looking for a healthy option at Downtown Summerlin, this is the place."}
{"text":"My mom dragged me off to this place last night for dinner. To put it simply, it was good but not great.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere that isn't overly loud or raucous, so they score points in that area. When I was in last night they had their HDTV turned to the big hockey game that was on - but they had it muted, which I actually appreciate. Additionally, the restaurant serves alcohol, which is a rarity in little deli-type atmospheres like this (I don't drink, but I know there are people that will appreciate this.)

The menu is fairly diverse but limited, as the place prides itself on its unique creations. Unfortunately, this means that other than the fries that comes with items, there isn't a whole lot in the way of American food being served here - I always like to have something I can fall back on if a place's menu has nothing to appeal to me.

After ordering our food, I noticed that

A) It was DAMN EXPENSIVE! For the 3 of us to get a Pita and a drink, the total was nearly $30! 

B) The wait time for our food was inexcusably long. If I wanted to wait this long, I would go to an actual dine-in restaurant and not a place like this. You know something is wrong if I have damn near finished my drink before the food gets there!

And then comes the part that just absolutely, positively ruined the visit for me. I ordered the Chicken Pita which stated it comes with chicken, hummus, and peppers. A nice combination for me. When I got it and bit into it, the taste instantly threw me off.

They had put lettuce and cucumbers in my pita. NOWHERE ON THE MENU DOES IT STATE THAT THEY PUT THIS STUFF IN THERE.

I hate lettuce and cucumbers, and putting these things in without letting me know anywhere on the menu was completely unacceptable. I know this may sound laughable to people who frequent these types of restaurants, but I am NOT a regular of these places. If you're running a restaurant like this, you are going to get people who are not regulars. And they need to know EVERYTHING. If I wanted lettuce and cucumbers, I would have ordered a damn salad! You don't have to ruin my Pita to impose them on me!

It's a shame this place is so expensive, so slow to serve, and doesn't say everything they put in your food - because if not for these little flaws, the place could have been quite good. I was going to only give a 2-star rating, however the staff were all friendly and I think that counts for something. If anyone from the restaurant is reading, if you could fix these little flaws, you could make it a solid 4-star establishment - no questions asked."}
{"text":"My dad has been raving about this place. He's kinda picky.. So this is a big deal! We live on the west side of the mall so it's nice to have some new food places open, kinda sick of the other places. 

I had the chicken skewer, the chicken was cooked perfectly & seasoned well. The feta cucumber salad was very tasty although it could have used more dressing. The pita & hummus were some of the best I've had in a while! Fresh food, very friendly helpful service. A lot of their reviews say it was a long wait time for food, well duh people they just recently opened. People are so clueless! Anyways, our food took 8 minutes from order to the table. I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I was out shopping and stopped in for a quick bite. Didn't have high hopes for this place but the chicken pita was actually pretty damn good! It was juicy, fresh, and well seasoned. The restaurant was clean and the staff was nice. Food came out pretty quickly too."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick healthy bite to eat when you are shopping and you build up an appetite. Ordered one of their new chicken rice bowls for $8.99. It was a generous portion of grilled chicken, saffron rice, cucumber feta salad, hummus and unlimited pita bread. The staff was friendly and the service was fast, they bring the food to your table for added convenience."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place but had never eaten here before. I decided to stop by before the movies and am glad I did. Food was great. All really fresh with great flavor. Even though you order at the counter the employees come by to check on you are provided great service. Patrick goes out of his way to provide a good dining experience."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get rotisserie chicken.  Not that there are a ton of choices in Las Vegas, but the chicken here would do well anywhere.  Nicely seasoned.  It's herby, lemony, tangy and delicious.  The dark meat is always moist.  I stay away from chicken breast generally so can't speak to it.  

If you want tasty chicken....here's the place."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day! Really great food, nice staff, and a clean dining room. And all of my takeout orders have been correct."}
{"text":"One of the better options at Town Square.  Rice bowls are solid, but I had the lamb skewer.  Great cucumber salad and some couscous as well,  Good hummus.   A solid lunch spot, with friendly service.  Better than dropping some major cash at the sit down restaurants.  Expect about $10 per person."}
{"text":"This is the real deal with great service. The chicken is very moist, nicely spiced with generous portions."}
{"text":"A well done \"main stream\" pita option that has a lot of fun takes on wraps! I got the rotisserie chicken caesar salad pita wrap. It came with french fries and a side of ketchup in the to go box. 

The wrap was good, the dressing was applied a tiny but too generously and I personally wish I had ordered the grilled chicken inatead of the rotisserie but the rotisserie was very good if that's what you enjoy or don't have a strong preference. The french fries were pretty standard but not bad. All of this was just over $10 after tax which I found a little expensive that other pita options around town but I also understand this may be due to the downtown summerlin location which is more upscale and probably has a more premium rent than other spots.

All in all, a good option that I would enjoy again if I'm in the area and looking for a quick lunch but I don't think I'd go out of my way to get to this place."}
{"text":"This place is close to my home. I never knew it was there. It came up on google maps the other day so I tried it and I am totally hooked. I love this place. Can't believe I never new it was there. Their vegetables are even great! Place is also neat and very clean. The only drawback might be the parking is a little crowded due to being in The District. Well worth your time."}
{"text":"We ate here over Memorial Weekend. The food was good and the service was great. My daughter is 8 and loved everything. We tried shrimp, steak, lamb, chicken, grape leaves and when we ran out of pita they gave us more for my daughter. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love all the crazy pitas there are inexpensive and delicious. The lamb shanks that they serve on the weekends are to die for!!!!!!! I also get the braised lamb ummmmmmmmmmm. I mean I'm seriously hooked on this place and constantly crave it. Their food is healthy delicious and good quality."}
{"text":"clean healthy fast and fresh I like to just phone my order in and take the food for pick up easy access I-15 and Green Valley"}
{"text":"I ve been twice and haven't liked it either time. The lines are crazy long and by the time you get the food it's not good! The hummus come like water and the meat has been undercooked both times! Won't be back sorry to say!!"}
{"text":"Really good, clean, but cheap on the fries.   
Come on ! They are just potatoes,  your prices are a little high anyway.
I used to love the ice tea until I went in and saw the ice tea bins were dirty.   See pics..
Uh-oh !!! They are asking for a tip before you get your food !!!!! That's called rude.   You need to earn your tip after good service and a good meal, NOT BEFORE !  Trying to be kind ?  Don't be rude.... asking for a tip on the get-go is rude."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I came in with my family of 4 today and the food was incredible. I ordered a steak skewer and it was so tender. The service was also very friendly by a young redhead lady!!!!!!! Bomb as fuck !!!!!!"}
{"text":"So seriously just got into this yelp game and I really like it. I came in here with a home girl, and we had great service from the young man named nic? I believe. Really ok I don't think Anyone on my Facebook reads these but y'all need to go to crazy pita. They have service like no other and they got the food of kingsssssssssssss"}
{"text":"This is my Peanut Butter & Jelly. 

My husband & I are very different when it comes to food. For example, he can eat PB&J every day for lunch & not get tired of it. Not that he does, but he says he can. 
I have never understood this b/c 
1) I'm not fond of PB&J sandwiches, never have been. 
&
2) I can't eat the same thing every day, day after day b/c I just can't. I need variety!

Well this is my PB&J! I finally found something I could eat everyday for lunch, dinner or hell, even breakfast! I always get the same thing, the Lamb skewer plate which comes with 1 skewer of the most succulent, tender & deliciously seasoned lamb I have ever had along with couscous topped with zucchini & squash, feta salad, hummus & pita. It's perfect & delicious every. single. time. In fact, it's keeping me from trying anything else on the menu but I'm ok with that. Maybe someday I will branch out, but for now, if I could eat it every day, I probably would & not tire of it for a very long time!"}
{"text":"I do not get what the hype about this place was about.  Quite mediocre food. Our lamb skewer was overcooked (even charred in spots) as were the shrimp in the pita. All the sides were just so so, about what you'd expect at a food court pita place... Definitely agree with all those who said it's overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"My wife, father and I love, love, love their food.  We always get chicken and steak kabobs and every time they are fresh, hot and delicious.  Those kabobs with their hummus and pita are to die for.  We love sitting on the patio.  Service is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I work in Town Square and love coming here during my lunch break. Today I had went there and they had forgotten to give me the pita bread, so I had called to see if it was okay to come back and pick it up, and the employee was so persistent on delivering it to me and being overly apologetic for the issue. 

Any place can serve food, but for the fact that this place consistently serves incredible food, and to top it off, has incredible customer service, they can consider me a forever customer. 

Thank you to all the employees at the Town Square Crazy Pita that always make my dining experience incredible."}
{"text":"3.5 is more accurate. 

Food, service and qualty is good but my lamb had some silver on it so it made it kinda tough for a couple of pieces. 

Good prep it properly if you're gonna do any meat. Other than that it was good but nothing special. I even forgot about this place until I saw it on the side panel for suggestions."}
{"text":"I go into Town Square all the time and haven't tried this until this last weekend...

Wow!  This place is so good and very reasonably priced. They have a lot of good option and it's very tasty."}
{"text":"We found this place while looking for alternative to the food on the strip. So, there's your point of comparison. It appears to be the most affordable option in the shopping center if you ignore outright junk food. Despite this, the food was great by any standard. Best lentil soup from a restaurant ever. Braised/pulled Lamb plate was good. The hummus was smoother/runnier than I'm used to but was very good. Friendly. I wish they would serve on re-usable plates and cutlery."}
{"text":"I visited this location today for lunch for the first time. I usually wait for a few visits to see if I like the establishment and if they are consistent with great service. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised at the friendly customer service from each and every employee encountered couple with a perfect meal. I had the half-chicken rotisserie with salad, pita bread, and hummus. Each item was delectable and I will be visiting this location more often. 
My co-worker had the Mediterranean salad with add-on steak kabob and had the same opinion of her meal.

The location was clean and they have fresh brewed iced-tea!"}
{"text":"Hello again to all the Yelpers' out there that actually have been looking or reveiwing my comments and factual experiences..well I just wanna start out by saying for my most recent experience within 24 hours was a \"Great\" one. This establishment is ran by some very cool and humble individuals. Angela whom was our cashier had nothing but inviting energy when she assisted us with our choices of pita's or different cuisines to choose from. Her recommendations were the \"Bomb\" I loved my Chicken Pita Wrap..thanks Angela. This was my first time ever, so I didn't know how to proceed in the line. There was this also very humble and inviting Gent by the name Mark that was also very attentive. I found out his name from the cashier Angela, when I asked her his title. She told me \"He was her Manager\". I looked for him personally first but unfortunately he was not around, did want to verbally tell him of our experience in person. The cooks are in a league all by themselves. Everything was superb. I did really enjoy the atmosphere, it was a gorgeous but breezy day yesterday. I will make this a favorite spot to go back too."}
{"text":"I love the fact they serve whole wheat pita. I ate a chicken sandwich wrapped in pita and it was delicious. The staff is very friendly and the price for the food is just right. 

It is important I can eat healthy on the go. And this place is just right when I don't have time."}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is a delightful little restaurant in The District, that serves flavorful Mediterranean food.

My bf and I have been there twice now, and I am pleased to say that their food is consistently good.

I LOVE Mediterranean cuisine.   Falafel, hummus, lamb...I love it all, but its sometimes hard to find good quality.

Friday evening, having a little time to kill, but not enough time to wait at other places, we decided to hit Crazy Pita.

I ordered the kefte platter, which is seasoned ground beef deliciousness.  Its served on a bed of veggie couscous, with hummus, and a cucumber and feta salad. 

Everything was wonderful.

My fella ordered the combination platter, and selected the shrimp and lamb skewers.  YUM.  Shrimp was great, and the lamb was SO tender.  

Reasonable prices, clean location, and very friendly staff all add to The Crazy Pita's appeal.  Whenever I find myself on this side of town, I would be glad to come back again."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. If you park in the lot behind \"I love burgers\", it's fairly simple to walk to. 

I always get the Mediterranean salad, add a steak kebab and a drink...the price comes to $12 and some change. Great price for eating somewhat healthy. Their Coca-Cola machine rules, it has 100 selections.. love it!"}
{"text":"Put on ur crazy clothes, brush ur crazy teeth, get in your crazy car, drive crazy as hell, and get ur crazy food at crazy pita! Shit is crazy.... crazy good lol"}
{"text":"As Jerry Seinfeld said at his show in Las Vegas it good but I wouldn't recommend it the kabobs I had were good but not great. Tatziki sauce how ever you spell it no thank you  the best thing about the place was the soda fountain. It is one of those new Coke machines that make 1000 different combinations."}
{"text":"Nothing like the red haired cashier lying to you about how much the half chicken price was and overcharging me the price as if I won't notice. Decided not to get the $18 half chicken meal because they were out of dark meat so I got something else. My friend who came later ordered the same about 7 min after I sat down. I asked him how much the chicken was.. $11.99. Ohhhh really so I asked the same cashier waitress over. I asked her why mine cost $18 not $12. She said it must have been the other cashier which I guess was her twin from the back because there was only one cashier by the time I started ordering.  What kind of people are working at this place? it was prob max 10min from when I ordered and sat down with no one in line before me so I was the only one there. 
 
Good food but the service is what you get worse from el pollo loco and less for your money.

Edit: just saw another review here about the red haired girl with bad service."}
{"text":"This place has very good food! Extremely tender meat, I ordered the combo plate and it was delicious as well as there falafel! And it was amazing! U have to try their house hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is located in the far end corner of Town Square next to the new Gameworks location and i Love Burgers. I've been in a gyro/pita mood as of late, and had my eye on this place for a while. I ordered a Felafel Pita ($7.99) with, of course, a side of tzatziki sauce. Crazy Pita's Felafel Pita had a twist to it because it had the unexpected additions of hummus and roasted peppers in the wrap. I'm still undecided whether I like this new take better than the classic version however. ;) What really stood out for me was how incredibly fresh the felafel was. It was warm, moist, and almost had the texture of a meatball. Not to be a Debbie Downer, but the fries that came with the meal were downright tiny (as in portion size)! What am I, a toddler? A girl's gotta eat! Overall though, the food was great.

The service was quite attentive, although I should add it was pretty empty inside. The restaurant was impeccable, cleanliness wise. For a meal for two, the bill came to around $21. If I'm in Town Square and need a quick hassle free meal, I'll definitely return to Crazy Pita."}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken is so delicious. Took off one star just because place is on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Love this place! They accommodated my large group with free pita and hummus! The falafel Pita was delicious (and vegan)! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"really great place to.eat without all the fuss. its a low key place in the district... it used to be in a strip mall before and that's when i found this hidden gem.
fresh flavorful and healthy food.  i always get the kabobs.. sometimes beef sometimes.chicken...its always most and delicous and its a big meal...comes with couscous with veggies mixed in..i really love it.  and with pita and hummus..."}
{"text":"Ok, what I'm about to write is going to sound crazy to some and put me in the MAJOR DORK catagory but---I don't care.

My personal trainer has me on a specific meal plan and I'm just sick and tired of grilled chicken, fish, veggies and brown rice. Based on pictures the food seemed NON greasy and extremely light. I ordered the mix grill of any two skewers with Lamb and Shrimp being the choice. It came with hummus, feta salad, and vegetable cous cous. When I got home I took one bite of the lamb/shrimp and it was absolute HEAVEN! Now---listen. I wasn't \"JUST\" hungry. There's a difference between saying something is delicious (nachos, pizza, cake) vs. something that is HEAVEN. The reason why I used the word Heaven is because there was no denying FRESHNESS about each ingredient. There were exotic spices and flavors  added that didn't overpower the food at all and sent my taste buds into a frenzy! 
I come from a culinary arts background and I honestly haven't had food like this in a very long time. I'm not in the culinary business anymore, but there was a time when I ate like this ALL the time. 

I have a collection of Bible movies (boring, I know you'll say) but in these movies as well in the bible they ate food like this all the time. I swear---when I was eating my mixed grill I felt like I was sitting at the table with JESUS! LOL---no lie! I can just imagine dining on these fresh ingredients while listening to a parable. LOL-- No msg, no red #40, no other words I can't pronouce. Just plain food cooked and prepared as it was originally intended to be. 
I called the owner---which I NEVER do, and told him how wonderful EVERY SINGLE BITE tasted. (I didn't mention I saw Jesus...haha) He was very happy and remembered me and what I ordered when I picked it up. 

It's amazing how we forget that less is so much more and we don't always need butter, gravy, salt, and cheese to get flavor. I am truly amazed that not only did I remain intact with my meal plan, but I actually ENJOYED my healthy food the same as if I was eating a pepperoni pizza!

Staff was SUPER friendly and what really sealed the deal was my MEDIUM RARE lamb was ACTUALLY medium rare! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Last night I ordered the chicken pita and the chicken wasn't fully cooked. I got food poisoning and am in the hospital."}
{"text":"I don't know why I didn't try this place sooner! 

This is great stuff with some healthy options. It's perfect for a quick and light lunch. My chicken wrap on whole wheat pita was incredible! The feta cucumber salad is so refreshing and delicious. My husband liked all the iced tea options.  

It was nice to be served by smiling and friendly employees. The restaurant has plenty of seating, and the outdoor tables are great for nice days. 

This is such a great healthy alternative in the area. And to think, all those times I \"settled\" on Panera next door! Will definitely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Hector was friendly and was very kind. The food was okay, but it was the customer service that made this place. Good job!"}
{"text":"Very healthy options that give your taste buds an awesome treat if you're near Green Valley Ranch.

I usually eat outside with my girlfriend if I have time but usually I'll order to go. They always have my plates ready within 15 minutes. I usually order the chicken skewer plate, this has plenty of diet variety including a small salad, vegetables and protein. I get full every time.

Of course there's always the baklava that is awesome here, the portion is perfect for that after meal treat."}
{"text":"Good service, fresh pita, with a nice falafel and one of those sweet million flavor coke machines!"}
{"text":"Yummy fast greek/mediterrean food. The Lamb was outstanding as was the grilled salmon. It came with couscous, vegetables, hummus and pita. It was a great find."}
{"text":"I loved this place, i'm glad i decided to stop and try it. Very clean great customer service.  Super fresh food hot and delicious, prices are also very reasonable.  I loved the Skewer shrimp plater everything about it was sooo Yummy, they give you decent amount of food also.  The Pita bread and hummus are soo delish and hummus is very creamy.  I recommend this place if u ever find your self looking for something affordable and yummy to eat at Town Square."}
{"text":"I think this place is great. I have enjoyed the food every time.  The service is always friendly but super slow! I will go back but not often. 

The steak pita is good minus the hummus. The children's chicken plate is delicious and enough food for my child. The 1/2 chicken plate is amazing! They need a rotisserie chicken pita and I would probably come here all the time!

I normally ask for extra olives and they give me a whole container worth every time without problems. I will go back to this place because it seems that it is getting better every time I go."}
{"text":"The place is delicious.  We had chicken plate, meat, chicken pita, everything was delicious.  The staff is super friendly. It was super full but only because it 8s food.  Happy to find out there is another location in town square."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! My sis and I were craving Medi food and the place that we were gonna go was closed, so we decided on this place. We were glad we did! I got the falafel pita and it was delicious and flavorful. The falafel was perfectly seasoned. The pita bread was soft and chewy. The staff and owner were very friendly and helpful. After you eat you can do a little shopping or hit the tables/slots at GVR."}
{"text":"Obsessed is all I can say when I talk about place!  I've liked everything I've tried so far.  Love the hummus, meat, salad, falafel etc etc.  Go here now!!"}
{"text":"I ordered catering from Crazy Pita for our board of directors meeting. I was very excited for our board members to have a new cuisine, but I've been very disappointed by the service. 

Our meeting was scheduled to begin at 11:30am, so I requested service by 11am. By 11:07am, food had still not arrived, so I called the restaurant and explained my situation. The person who answered the phone assured me that \"it's not late, so they'll be there.\" Didn't I just explain that I needed the food to be here by 11am? 

Not happy and will not be using their catering services again."}
{"text":"Oh My Gawd!  I did not see that coming.  We just drove in from Palm Springs....we stopped to eat before we could check in....Holy Cow....AMAZING FOOD.  FRESH,  DELICIOUS....NOT TOO HEAVY.  I Love this place from the bottom of my heart.   Ty at the register is Super Sweet, helpful and made us feel completely welcome.  Now I know this will be the most wonderful, fulfilling, delicious and LUCKIEST trip to Vegas we have every had.  Crazy Pita is a JACKPOT!!!!"}
{"text":"What made me give them 5 stars is the guy who works here not sure what his name is but he's bald and had a few tattoos. He has amazing customer service! He truly goes above and beyond. The food being good as well just tops everything! Such good service from everyone, really. I'm extremely impressed."}
{"text":"$4.97 for a soda * straight face* a little over priced. The pitas are pretty good. My husband loves this place."}
{"text":"Good spot and a great limpy... Also I would deathly recommend substituting the french fries for a delicious fetters cheese  salad

Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Just had lunch and it was great! Hubby had chicken pita, I had lamb pita and we shared the Mediterranean salad. Great flavors and so fresh. Only complaint is they use the skewer meat in the pitas and the chunks are too big. You take a bite and get a huge bite of meat. They should  slice it or chop it  and it would be perfect. Store was super clean and they sell \"be kind\" tshirts which we could all use and wear as a reminder"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for at least 5 years now. I come here for lunch because it's convenient and the service is consistent. The food has always been consistent also. It's fresh and grilled to order. I don't think I've ever had an issue with the food in the years I've been coming here.

All the proteins are delicious but I usually go with the steak or shrimp skewers. The steak is juicy with a little bit of char from the grill. The sides of hummus, feta salad, vegetable couscous, and warm pita make it a complete meal. If you get a salad, you can also add the skewers to your salad.

If you dine in, your food will be brought to you and they do a good job of keeping your table clean. Sit outside if the weather is right, there are trees to provide shade if you need it. Keep an eye out for buy one entree, get the second for 50% off coupons."}
{"text":"First of all food snobs get over yourselves. Of course it isn't authentic. It's fast food essentially. It's awesome though. The hummus is actually amazing and the closest to authentic I've found. I've actually lived outside the country in places where hummus is as commonly on your table as ketchup and this is very similar. Real hummus is thinner like theirs. The food is always perfectly cooked and seasoned, never salty and fairly healthy. The customer service is wonderful, everyone is friendly. At $10 it's worth every penny and keeps me full for hours. Definitely what I would choose over the many overpriced restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We love the food, but frankly we are outdoors people. We would eat here now if there was shade outside.  I don't understand why there's no awning or trees.  Please consider putting something in!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I have to run back here again anytime soon.  Guy behind the cash register was very friendly and very accommodating. Place was very clean & decorated nicely.

Hummus for me was way over processed.  It was as smooth as silk, almost like water.  I think it needed more flavor it was super duper bland. Definitely needed to be thicker and have much more garlic [I didn't even get a hint of garlic].  Pita was nice and warm. Side of Hummus sets you back $3.95 Now that I look at the pix the soupie hummus have been posted so you can see what I mean.

Ordered the chicken Pita with cucumber, tomato, feta salad. My GF ordered the same. Total Bill [with a coupon] was still over $23.00.  Chicken was really flavorful everything else that was in the Pita was pretty bland [once again] we ordered sides of tzatziki to add some flavor. Also, I did not spy any hot sauce anywhere to put on my pita. This is definitely not like the street meat one finds in NYC.  It was average at best.

2 other weird things to note 1) they do have TV's and we got the pleasure of watching ESPN Duck Hunting {WTF?} while we ate...BORING.  2) they had the front doors wide open even though it's still 90 degrees outside which zapped up all the cold AC so it was a little warm in there for our tastes."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great prices! Their kabobs and salads are healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"After the awful food at the Pita place in the Las Vegas South outlet mall, I'm glad I decided to stop by Crazy Pita in Town Square. It's a completely different experience. 

I ordered the shrimp skewer plate and sat outside in their patio to people-watch. The food was a good portion at a reasonable $10. The shrimp was well-seasoned and grilled perfectly. The tabouli was fresh and slightly tangy with a sprinkling of feta that provided an interesting texture.

The hummus was hummus-y. Honestly, I don't know how to describe hummus, only to say that it was good. The only thing I didn't like were the vegetables. They were cooked fine, but they were missing some more flavor. I wish they had the same seasoning and char as the shrimp. I just dipped them in the hummus.

Service was really good. The ladies are very friendly. One of them said, \"Come again soon!\" Thanks, girl, I'd love to! Lol."}
{"text":"Ericka made my son feel very special during our visit treats us really nice. My son felt very happy when we walks out of this place. People like her makes you want to come to for more. Thank you Ericka. Continues doing what are you doing. Excellent customer services!"}
{"text":"While crazy pita was friendly and helpful when I called to find out about their ingredients, I have to give them a one star because their falafel was the absolute worst I have ever had, as was their tahini sauce. We had crazy pita cater an event and I served myself three falafel balls. There wasn't really enough food for everyone (not sure if this is on them or on the person who ordered) so that's all I got for lunch. They were so disgusting that I could not finish them. Rock hard and super dry and UNBELIEVABLY salty."}
{"text":"The flavor on this Chicken Marinated Skewer Plater is delicious.  I will definitely bring our girlz here.  See the pic it WAS DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here on several occasions and have been itching to come back. Love their food. 

As a vegetarian, I have tried both the Vegetarian Pita and the Falafel Pita. I wasn't a fan of the Falafel, and it may not be due to the way that they prepare it. I'm probably just not a Falafel fan. But I do love their Vegetarian Pita and I tend to get it every time I am here. Big time fan! I also love the fries but sometime they can be hit or miss. But boy when they hit, very crispy and delicious!! I think I might try the Mezza Salad to switch things up next time, but it'll be hard to steer away from what I love. 

I'd recommend this place to those who want something a little outside of the typical norm of a burger or burrito on a quick lunch break. Lunch time can be pretty hectic. Ordering is never an issue, it's the finding a place to sit after you order that becomes the headache. But overall, the taste is great. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I ordered the mixed grilled plate with steak & lamb skewers, veggie couscous, & double cucumber salad with pita bread! It was delicious & on point! The portions were good, the meat was well seasoned & marinated! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Excellent chicken, pitas are great too. And the humus is creamy, rich and flavorful. Definitely try this spot for lunch! Ohhh and the customer service is spot on. Never needed or wanted anything they're always there for you during the meal. Very unique for a casual dining restaurant. Better than most sit down restaurants. Keep up the great work, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. It's fast, clean, and good. I frequent it often now that I've found it. The staff is always so friendly and helpful with the highchairs. Food is delish and plently of options. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the salmon is awesome and the chicken too.  It really is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Frankly, hard to say what was better- the food or the service.
Mark behind the counter is a legend, really awesome customer service, great attitude, very helpful, smiles all the way. 
Definitely an asset to the establishment. Well done!"}
{"text":"Best pita sandwich I have ever eaten, and I don't usually like pita sandwiches, except the ones at Zankou chicken in Los Angeles.  This is better because all of the ingredients are fresh and healthy, and they served mine on a wheat pita.

The rotisserie chicken is good, but not Zankou chicken good but I'm still going to give this place five stars because the steak pita sandwich was that frickin good."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Light, healthy & filling but doesnt weigh you down! Incredible! We got the mezza salad & mixed skewer!"}
{"text":"Great service!!!! 5 Stars and food was also great another 5 stars. We are here from Fresno Ca for a a volleyball tournament here in Vegas and we wanted something besides casino food. We googled pita and we got this site, yes!!! Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Very nice place and extremely friendly and professional people! The best fast food I've ever tried! I went there before my 2 weeks trip and after. I wish we had this restaurant in California."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything we've had there has been so fresh and so tasteful.  Everyone that works there is very friendly and helpful as well.   Easy to park as well"}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is crazy good food.  The owner is a really great guy and is obsessed with a quality product. The lamb pita is my personal favorite but the rotisserie chicken is fantastic.  Super clean, great food, friendly staff and you leave satisfied. What more do you want in a place to eat?

A year later and still an awesome place to eat.  The chicken lentil soup is a great hidden gem.  I have also become fond of the salmon skewers!"}
{"text":"There is not enough praise I can give to Crazy Pita.  The food is fresh, healthy, and well prepared. The staff are always friendly and smile 

My personal favorites are the lamb pita and the 1/4 chicken lunch plate.  Both are so damn good that I can rarely get past them when ordering here.  My wife loves the salmon skewers and the shrimp skewers. Both are cooked properly and the seafood is fresh.  I have eaten at one of the three Crazy Pita locations at least 20 times in the past 12 months and can honestly say I have never had a bad meal.  

If you eat in they are generous with the pita bread and the staff is always willing to give you more when the bowl runs low.  Genuine people serving honestly prepared food for reasonable prices in a squeaky clean restaurant.  What more can you ask for??

Oh and the owner Mehdi is one of the nicest people you will meet.  Down to earth guy running a great business."}
{"text":"The staff here is super friendly and the pitas are delicious! I also recommend the roasted eggplant dip."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and healthy! I got the Lamb Pita Sandwich today and I highly recommend it! This spot is super clean and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Updating my review as the service has improved significantly, and I want to show some love for the amazing food. Everything I have eaten here is amazing, and on the weekends they have an extremely enjoyable braised lamb shank plate. Also, everything is reasonably priced for the quality and quantity you get. Keep rockin Crazy Pita! 

They still seem to close up early at times, so to avoid disappointment best to get there at least 30 mins before the posted closing time."}
{"text":"GET SKEWERED

Billing itself as \"Fresh Casual Mediterranean,\" Crazy Pita so far has been one place at Downtown Summerlin that's offered us a fairly decent selection of fairly healthy protein at a fairly reasonable price. 

I'm a fan of the skewer plates which come with your choice of chicken, steak, seasoned beef patties (Kefta), lamb, shrimp, salmon, or vegetable.  Actually, I've only had the skewers, so consider this a SKEWER REVIEW.  A $9.99 plate comes with one skewer of your choice accompanied by hummus, vegetable couscous, feta side salad, and some of that Crazy Pita bread ($8.99 for the veggie skewer plate.)  Upgrade to 2 skewers of your choice for $12.99.  I've had both the chicken and steak skewers and each skewer looked to be about 5 ounces of meat.  The food has been flavorful each time and, with the sides, a macro-friendly meal that hits the spot in a guilt-free way.  Now, if you can just depart the mall without walking into that spectacular gelato store down the way, your healthy intentions will remain intact; stay strong, my friends.

P.S.  This place is ALWAYS busy and I'm ALWAYS freezing in there.  Bring your patience and maybe a sweater."}
{"text":"Wow we love this place I got the chicken screwer plate which comes with hummus too, very healthy. My son got the beef bowl which he loves. The service was fast the and lady at the cash register is very nice. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If the smells emanating from this place don't lure you in, I don't know what will. I have had the pleasure of eating here a couple of times now and have enjoyed myself every time.

I always order the chicken skewer platter which comes with hummus, feta salad, vegetables and couscous. This platter is very filling but not in a overwhelming way. All the ingredients are fresh and the rotisserie grills the chicken to perfection. The hummus is so creamy, you could almost drink it! Overall, their food is just delicious!

The staff that work here are super friendly and helpful. The place is not large but houses enough tables on the inside to hold quite a few people. In addition, there is outdoor seating although limited and a view of the parking lot it is still nice to eat outside. All the tables are wiped down as soon as people get up. There are no trash cans standing around as the staff collects your trash for you. This place might be labeled fast food, but I think it is a \"healthy food choice\".

The menu is vast and will appeal to most people. In addition to the skewer plates, they offer salads, pita sandwiches, rice bowls and rotisserie meals.

When shopping at DTS, stop in for a tasty lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special whatsoever.

My husband and I came here when we were looking for a quick meal before leaving Vegas. I ordered the lamb pita, and he ordered a shrimp pita. We both got fries with it.

The fries were really good, I'll give them that...but the pita was bad. The lamb was extremely tough and didn't have good flavor, and the pita bread was very hard. The pita was just not good whatsoever - I barely ate any of it. The shrimp in my husband's pita was not exactly plentiful, but he said that it was good. 

This place is also incredibly overpriced. They charged 8$ for two drinks - one was a bottled soda, and one was a bottled water. This brought our lunch to almost 30$. This place is a ripoff with mediocre food. 

Definitely would not come back unless I was desperate!"}
{"text":"I work at Town Square and it's nice to have something that's not too pricey and bar like. Food is pretty good. Good for a quick bite. I got the falafel pita wrap, it comes with fries. It cost me $9 and it's a good size portion. I ate all of my food, so no leftovers to take with  me."}
{"text":"Update: I was contacted by this location and they apologized for missing the sauces, I am very impressed that they actually reached out and made effort to correct the situation. They also let me know that they actually deliver over $50 which is super great to know for my company!



I overall have a great opinion of Crazy Pita and all the staff at this location. I do order from it about 3-5 times a week for my office. We always purchase a large amount through Postmates and I have learned to call and double check the order before they start making it. As long as I do that everything comes out fine. The only thing that drives me bonkers is every order I request them to throw in a couple of Tzatziki and Harissa sauces and every single  time, I get none. Today I basically begged on the phone to make sure there are sauces in the bag and again I got zero. In the end I end up taking the heat from my bosses because there are no sauces. Please just add sauces to the bag!!!"}
{"text":"I have been standing here for 5 minutes while these men stand here and speak to one another instead of packing up my food. 

I'm not really sure why he's laggin and I'm not really sure why he told me I got extra pita with my 3 skewers plate. Like my family eats here once a month I know when I ask for extra pita and say I'll pay whatever, I want extra pita. 

Don't say oh it's in there but it really is not. All the males working that day which was Sunday were consistently hovering and talking and shooting the shit while the real employees are sweating and busting their heinys in the kitchen working. 

This lady cooking has so many plates on the counter at one point until they broke their group huddle. 

Be attentive and don't lie. Like extra pita is not a big deal but my food siting there for 5 minutes while you shoot the shit! Very big deal. Get it together men"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. 

There are many great places to eat at Town Square and I totally feel like we settled by coming here. 

Prices seemed a bit high. My hubbie got a falafel plate which came with three falafel over bland cous cous and it was 10.00. I ordered the  steak skewer plate and wasn't super excited about it either. Neither of us liked the taste of the veggies that the plates were served with. And the 'feta salad' was salad with a little feta on top. 

The interior of the restaurant is all yellow which is a drag to look at and looks like it needs an update. 

Overall I think there are wayyyyyy better Mediterranean places in Vegas and overall wayyyy better options at Town Square."}
{"text":"I love Crazy Pita. Their food is fresh, flavorful and delicious. My favorites are the lamb anything, the Vegetable Couscous and the baklava. I often order off their catering menu for our parties."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place!! My coworkers were raving how great this place was so I went today at lunch time (12:30p) to order a steak pita and the cashier tells me they are out of beef and I would have to wait till 3pm for their truck to come deliver more product. What the fuck? Really? How do you run out of beef on a Friday afternoon?? Cashier didn't even offer chicken or another substitute as he saw how frustrated I was. Poor customer service!!! Definitely won't come back and will tell my coworkers not to go there anymore!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We stopped in to get some \"to go\" after the movies. I had the Falafel Pita and my husband had the two skewer plate with one lamb and one beef. The flavor of the Falafel was really solid and the veggies were sooooo fresh. My husband's skewers were nicely seasoned, lean and well cooked. He also enjoyed all the sides...hummus, salad and cous cous. This may not be the most authentic of Mediterrean restaurants but the food is so fresh and not greasy or over seasoned. Very enjoyable and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visit this great establishment religiously every Saturday. The food is consistently amazing. Hot, fresh, and with mouth watering flavor. What takes this place to the next level though is the service. The kind of service that rivals if not betters most high end restaurants. Incredibly attentive, and courteous. Thank you to the owner, and all employees (notably Hector, Marcus, Patrick, and Tori) for always making it an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I've been back. Food was great.  Looks like they got past the growing pains from when they first opened.  Service is fantastic.  This location is now As good as the green valley location.  Glad I gave it another chance."}
{"text":"Great tasting, fresh, and healthy.  Though the food is Americanized (which all the places in Vegas are) it's way better than the other Mediterranean, Greek, or other middle eastern places in town."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a positive review, because the guy who took my order was very nice and helpful, but the food ranged from mediocre to awful. The chicken skewer was mediocre, just a few fairly generic, too salty chicken pieces over rice. The falafel was terrible. It tasted like it came from a frozen package, not at all fresh tasting. The hummus and baba ganoush tasted like they came out of a store package. The food really did not leave a good taste in my mouth. I realize that the area lacks good food in general, but this was a very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've met the owner once. But he's always here. Customer Service is great!  The ambiance is laid back and great for kids and families.  And ridiculously clean!!!

$9.99 for a half chicken with salad, hummus and pita bread.  $6.99 for kids chicken skewer or beef skewer.  

They have one of those gazillion coke flavor machines and actually have employee recommendations on mixes.  Cute!!

We are regularly here on Saturday mornings garnering the #1 table tent.  Lol.  It's a guilt free meal after kickboxing class.  

Thanks for the wonderful food and great service."}
{"text":"If you follow my blog Colorblind then you know I love this place. reminds me of my family and my dad's cooking. Everything is fresh including the hummus and the staff there is so sweet! You can enjoy a glass of wine grilled deliciousness and not feel guilty! Unless you eat all the pita bread like I did. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The staff at this place is wonderful! They are very attentive and on top of what's going on with their clientele. I got the Lentil soup which was amazing and very affordable for a good portion size. The food was warm and did not take too long at all. I would imagine this place would also be great for takeout as the food would travel well. If you are into Greek food this is just the place for you."}
{"text":"From a great weekend with friends in Vegas, we decided to grab lunch before we drove back to LA. We went on Yelp and ended up here. They stated that they have only been open for 4 days. The other location had good reviews so we ended up eating here.

The place was clean, the staff is nice and there is parking all around because it's at the shopping center.

Food was amazing. I got their Chicken and Steak Plate, it had the cucumber salad, hummus, couscous and their serving of meat was good too. They also gave you a side of soft and fresh pita. It was aaahh-mazing!

If you want a place with good food for a good value, please go there and visit! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and can't wait to go back! For quick, tasty food in a clean restaurant with good prices and outdoor seating options, this is the place for you. (And beer and wine is available too)

I get the falafel pita combo because it comes with lettuce and hummus in it and fries on the side. It's very filling and a great vegetarian option!"}
{"text":"Pretty good feed here. I got a vegetarian pita since I wanted something light and all the ingredients sounded good: roasted eggplant dip, roasted cauliflower, roasted red bell pepper, olives and feta. It tasted good too but I thought it was a little small for the $7.99 price tag. It comes with a small pile of fries as well. Service was above average though - very helpful and nice."}
{"text":"I'm super disappointed with my experience at Crazy Pita. I ordered 2 lamb pitas with a side of tzatziki sauce. It took almost half an hour for our food to be ready, which I'm normally okay with if the quality and service is great. However, that was not the case. When I arrived to my car, I realized there was a huge leak from the bag. Upon opening my food, there was an excessive amount of ketchup splattered all over the center portion of the box, right under the pita. The ketchup completely doused the fries and got into my pita. So gross! I don't understand why they wouldn't just put the ketchup in a container? Or just give us packets? Also, there was no tzatziki (of course). Never going back :/"}
{"text":"It was ok. The fries aren't great, but all of the other food is good. They're not a real Greek place, there are better ones around the valley with much better prices."}
{"text":"Love the chicken skewers plate! 
Service was friendly and honest!

Only thing if you're coming here for lunch.. parking at district is busy."}
{"text":"Came in with a nice dinner with my parents. After paying for my food I went to grab a drink and they ran out of ice and did not tell us. After bring out our food they took an additional 5 mins to grab us a fork. After complaining about the ice they just said there is simply nothing they can do. I was disappointed by the service."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place ... I first found it quite pricey ... But was still hoping for it to be good. When the food arrived, I was disappointed ... Even though it was plenty of food, I felt it wasn't very good ... Our chicken was totally dried up ..  The feta salad had one crumble of feta and everything else was mediocre. Bummer, but I think I won't go again."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! It's right down the street from my job. I only took a star off because I was disappointed that they didn't deliver although it says delivery:yes. I learned that they only cater for orders over $100; that's a lot different than delivery. 

I was looking for a relatively healthy place to eat food, since I'm on a healthy kick. I bought the two item skewer (chicken and shrimp) and I was very pleased. The combo was loaded and the food was fresh. Also, the ice tea selection was pretty intense; plenty to choose from. I chose the passion fruit tea and it was yummy!

If you're looking for a healthy/ier option than what you've been stuffing down your throat, this may be your best bet in the area. Great option for lunch. you won't be disappointed!

On that note, I wish they would deliver (maybe on orders over $20?). I would order a few times a week since I'm too lazy to cook at home and I'm tired of the convenient options that loaded with failure to your health (pizza, Chinese, fast food, etc.).

I can only hope."}
{"text":"Initially I was going to rate this place with 3 stars but after consideration, I give it 4 stars because it's fast food Mediterranean food. The portions are decent, the food was slightly on the bland side. I could have used more hummus with my 2 lamb skewer meal. I also got the braised lamb pita which made the meal worth it."}
{"text":"The braised lamb special is good.  It's stewed in two different squash along with sweet pumpkin (doesn't mix well w/ the rest) and probably done in tomato base.  The tender meat was excellent, but they need to taper down on the salt.  The $12 meal came with hummus, which was a little runny and based on the color, more tahini than I would prefer.  The cucumber salad was surprising really good as the level of dressing was just lightly tossed.  The couscous was a little different, but meshed well with the meal.  Their pita bread was crazy fluffy, so that helped with the salty base.  

My husband ordered the chicken skewer and because it was a meal, we assumed it was 2 skewers instead of 1.  Looks like we'll have to fork up $13 for the meal next time, because the portions were small.  They were all served on a divided plastic lined styrofoam plates with plastic silverware to match.

They have happy hour 1/2 off on all beer and tiny bottled wine.  I remembered they carry from red to sweets for wine and probably 9 different bottles of beer.  Pretty good selection for a tiny joint like this.  

They also carried a whole line of \"Be Kind\" t-shirts.  Not sure, what that is about, but it's pretty neat."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.. I come to this location at least once a month lol. I have only tried the steak Pita so far but it is so tasty. I wish they would cut the meat I'm a bit smaller chunks so it's a bit easier to eat but either way it still taste good to me. The service is pretty decent too. So far my experience has been enjoyable and the food delicious in my opinion. The steak is cooked just right! I wish they would give a little more fries though it almost seems skimpy next to the Pita lol but I guess it's their way of not carb loading. I suggest they should do a rewards system :)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here, and I used a buy 1 get 1 50% coupon. I had the shrimp pita & the lamb pita. Both were good, but I was expecting to be more than mildly impressed with the meals. The lamb was mostly tender, save for some fat on the big chunks. Both were lacking much flavor, and they needed more hummus. It's fresh food, for sure, and that is a plus. Pretty messy meals, I resigned to fork & knife. I enjoyed the fries that come with the pitas. I'd like to try the kabobs next time!"}
{"text":"I would say that Crazy Pita is one of my favorite restaurants around. There's nothing really special about this restaurant, but it's just a solid place to go. The food is incredible and the staff is always ridiculously nice. If the idea of going to Crazy Pita ever comes up, I'm always the first one to say yes. I typically get the steak skewers and it's one of my favorite meals ever. I think everyone needs to try Crazy Pita at least once. Trust me. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Its been almost a year since Ive been there (visiting vegas) and I still crave it! Cant wait to visit again. This will surely be a must when I visit again. I had the falafel plate w a skewer. Dont forget to try their home made hot sauce!"}
{"text":"The food is great! The service is way beyond average! Super clean! Reasonable prices! 

Also great for catering! We have has Crazy Pita catered in for work, which is actually how this place became one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"In a word: Fantastic! We ventured away from the strip looking for a place to eat and found this by accident. We ordered the rice bowls. The chicken was juicy, tender and flavorful. The staff was friendly and pleasant.  We look forward to our next trip so we can try other dishes, and we highly recommend this restaurant !!"}
{"text":"After a bad experience with service and forgetting part of my to go order I took a break from Crazy Pita for a while. Todays experience was much better! It is a tad pricey but the food was great.

I went for my usual lamb skewer plate with eggplant dip. The lamb was cooked well (a tad over done for my taste but still very good) and i really enjoyed the greek salad and cous cous. Now for the eggplant dip..it is soooo delicious. I have had it other places but no one does it as good as Crazy Pita. It is smokey and smooth and goes great with the included pita. 

I will be returning soon again for more of that dip!"}
{"text":"This place has grown on me. At first I was skeptical of the pitas, since the meat in not the customary beef / lamb mixture. But, I have grown to love their food. I usually get a gyro with a side of hummus or a salad. The salads are really good.
The location is a great place to sit and talk or people watch."}
{"text":"Their food always has the feeling of being fresh & light (unless you get the fries, and come on, fries can never really be described in that way). My favorite thing to get here is the marinated chicken skewers; they come with hummus, feta salad, and couscous, but I'm not a fan of the couscous so I ask to sub it out with either extra hummus or extra salad, and they never have an issue with that (I love a place that doesn't balk at simple substitutions!). The hummus is more watery than I like and not as flavorful as I'd like, so instead of dipping my pita pieces in it, I use it as a sauce for my chicken, which has a TON of good flavor. The feta salad as awesome -- tiny pieces of romaine, feta, tomato, cucumber, and red onion with a couple kalamata olives (I don't like olives so I pick those out). My mom is crazy about their Mediterranean salad, which is an entree salad with romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, roasted red peppers, roasted cauliflower, artichoke hearts, and kalamata olives (it's also awesome if you add a skewer's worth of chicken to it). The dressing they have for the salad is SO DAMN GOOD that I always end up stealing some to dip my pita wedges in. Sure, I could order a side of it for my own use, but it's always more fun (and the food seems to taste better) when you steal it from someone else, no?"}
{"text":"I was just expecting this place to be a basic mediterranean place, but I really enjoyed it!! I wish they had locations out here in the Midwest. I definitely understand why my friend, who lives in Summerlin, visits so often and raves about it!

We dined in on New Year's day for lunch and boy was it busy! I'm sure it's not always like this on weekdays, but since most were off for the holiday, it probably contributed to the high volume of customers. 

My friend ordered for me - Chicken Pita + french fries and we shared an order of hummus and pita. Everything seemed very fresh and it was all delicious! Loved the warm, soft pita that came with the hummus, which was also really good!

When they built this place, they should have made it bigger. It was definitely too small for the number of customers they had. There were many groups standing around, stalking tables, and waiting for seats. They had their patio open, and we started off by sitting out there - wasn't too bad with a coat, but I'm sure a lot of people would rather be inside during chillier days."}
{"text":"Beef kabobs are great here. Nice quick place to eat something when you're shopping. Great healthy menu"}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly, the food is great and the location perfect. The steak was tender, chicken moist and hummus tasty. Everything was seasoned perfect. Will definitely return on next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here is really good but the lack of stars is due to the service at this location. The young lady seemed irritated and was rude. It's a shame cause we would eat here at this location more if it were not due to the service."}
{"text":"Crazy Pita is a decent spot for a quick bite. 

I have been several times and have ordered the same thing each time. They offer quick options and even deliver, which I haven't taken advantage of yet.

Service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Was in Town square with my Son late Saturday evening , wanted to try something healthier and middle eastern , and this place is not good at all , the chicken and the cocscous was horrible and the Tzatiki was blan no taste or cucumbers or garlic taste to it, maybe I ordered the wrong item from the menu? I don't know , the food was bad!!!! Don't think I'll be back anytime soon!!!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but it was incredibly slow service. It took forever to place an order and there was no one in line. I probably won't be back .. I can't stand slow service"}
{"text":"It's okay but too expensive for what you get. I prefer other kabob places with lower prices, but they are located at Town Square which I guess is why they charge so much."}
{"text":"This place was great! I suspect I see chain / franchise in the future! Good Middle Eastern style peta , kabobs, and so forth. Beer and wine available."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite pace for lunch. She tells me the staff is wonderful and the food is delicious. She loves the lamb salad she has brought some home and I can tell you the food is delicious and reasonably priced. I say, try it..."}
