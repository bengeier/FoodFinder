{"text":"Several coworkers and I went on our lunch break.  We were able to call our order in ahead of time so it was hot and ready when we arrived. They have amazing burgers and fries!  The staff and owners are super nice and were around talking to the guests.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Green beans were awesome. Steaks had so much fat the 12 oz. Were more like 5-6. We said something to the waitress and she talked to the kitchen. She came back with the kitchen said the wont do that again and i can only take 4 dollars off your order.   I've had better at a corporate location restaurant. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Not what I would expect when I first walk in, but this place smells.  And not in a good way.  More like a musty basement that someone tried to clean with bleach.   We were seated in the restaurant and it's very cold on this side of the facility.  An improvement in the building needs to be made.  So if you still decide to eat there, ask to sit in the lounge.    The chicken picata and cavatelli were bland.     Too much competition out there so eat someplace else."}
{"text":"Really good food. A bit pricy but portions are large. There fries are great but the baked potato/potato skins are always terribly dry. My husband and I eat here at least once a week. The last 2 orders we have picked up for take out had errors (and of course didn't realize until we got it home). Good food though!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service outstanding, but the real kicker are the portions!  Enough for a second (sometimes, even a third) meal!! Can't wait to hit their new Happy Hour with 1/2 price apps and drink specials!!"}
{"text":"I went because of a coupon in a local ad. We were pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of the food. It has been added to our favorite restaurant list. The entrance is in the back which takes away from the street appeal but not the good food. The picture doesn't show the whole place. The non-bar seating area is quieter and more comfortable for people like me who have bad knees. Families are definitely welcome."}
{"text":"It's great that this restaurant is about 5 mins away from my house. Although they can tend to be a bit pricey with some items on the menu, we discovered that Monday is the best day to go. It's less crowded, with an all day happy hour that features half off select appetizers and $1.00 off a wide selection of drinks, you can't go wrong.  My hubby and I got there around 6:00, just before the dinner rush. Our server Heidi was nice and courteous, but all over the place. We could tell that the couple seated behind us were getting disgruntled because she forgot to take their order. Luckily another server came to their rescue.   We started out with the spinach and artichoke dip, part of the happy hour special. It was served with some fresh, salty tortillas that were a bit greasy but good. (Would not pay the regular $8.99 for them).   The main event was the lasagna with meatballs and the homemade portobella mushroom ravioli. Both were served with a side salad and rolls. The lasagna was authentic and the meatballs were good sized, but mediocre in flavor. The ravioli was nicely done, too, but way too much Alfredo sauce. As you'll see in the photo, it was about 1/3 of the plate of sauce. I personally would have appreciated more ravioli and less sauce for the $16 price point.  Overall, the portions are big. They have a good selection of beer, wine and drinks. And they absolutely have the best cheesecakes and chocolate dipped cannoli in town. We'll go back, but probably just stick to the pizza, beer, appetizers and desserts."}
{"text":"This place recently opened featuring mostly Italian dishes, but they also do a lot of American food.  Four of us had dinner here and it was good wholesome food and lots of it.  Our waitress was super nice and helpful. The portions are rather large, so plan to take food home! We all had salads which were fresh and tasty. I had Lobster Mac, which was good. The others had Jerk Pork, Gnocchi, steak. Everyone enjoyed the meal and we all left happy and full. They have a full bar with a separate dining area   This would be a nice place to take the family. The prices are reasonable for the size of the portions and it is a nice clean bright place!"}
{"text":"I was there 3 hours ago. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap with extra cheese no veggies. For whatever reason you don't have buffalo sauce with a buffalo chicken wrap. Waste of $$$. What's sad is the bartender felt the need to check if the order had buffalo sauce on the side. I assumed she did the bag was tied in a knot and the young girl who gave her my bag of food to the bartender thought it would be a smart to not hold the food But better dangle the bag with a sauce of two meatballs with sauce in a lid? Is that honestly normal service anywhere? I have to listen to the bartender say the food is amazing and expect big portions. Those were both lies by the way. So again hank you for the buffalo chicken wrap with somehow no buffalo sauce, and awful service. Thanks you too for tailing my bag of food at at angle so I could see it too, what a joke."}
{"text":"Very cool place with great food and good prices. If you are familiar with park road bar in the area it has a similar feel. Although red creek is nicer. I think it's my new favorite neighborhood bar/restaurant.   Great place for sports. Plenty of tvs and plenty of angles."}
{"text":"A little higher price than a usual casual place.  Would be great for date night and the prime Rib melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the prime rib wasn't great but everything else was great service was a 10 Ambiance was nice"}
{"text":"Red creek is a nice place with a good menu. Sat at the bar and had the chicken club sandwich with onion rings. Sandwich was good and they make very good onion rings (lots of onion rings, more than I could finish). I would get this order again."}
{"text":"The food is just exceptional and the prices are not bad . You get slot of food and it's well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the homemade alfredo with blackened chicken. Haven't spent much time in Painesville in years so was delightfully surprised to see the renovated interior bar and restaurant. Nice staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"Good food, big portions, and good service. We sat on a high top table in the bar area. Good selection of drinks. My wife really enjoyed her pasta meal. Decent salad and tasty french rolls. I had the ribs and they were good. It's ubercasual, very family restaurant feel. Ceiling looks like an office cubicle. Entrance in the back isn't very inviting. And signage is confusing, is it Zappatelli's or Red Creek, or both? Probably just me, my wife said it was obvious but that didn't stop me from driving past it at first. Good spot for relaxed simple meal."}
{"text":"Their portion size is HUGE. It feeds both my husband and I plus left overs for the next day. My kids love going there. They are very friendly and have really great service. They have both a dining area for nice quiet meals with family and a bar space to watch the game! It's a great place to go."}
{"text":"The food is good. Desserts are great. We were going on a regular basis and would take in our coupons we received in the mail. The one time we went it the server was super rude and said we weren't allowed to use the coupon because our dish wasn't an \"entree.\" The coupon had a picture of a burger and that's what we ordered. We try to explain that we had been allowed to use the coupon before and they said management wouldn't allow it even though the coupon wasn't specific and had the picture of what we ordered. Ever since then we have only been back once. Just puts a bad taste in your mouth for poor service. Not to mention we had stale chips"}
