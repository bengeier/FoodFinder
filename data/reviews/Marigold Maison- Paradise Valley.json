{"text":"A nice addition to the hood. Food is flavorful. Ambiance and decor is lovely. Great service. Loved the lamb chop tandoori."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time yesterday. We moved to Phoenix from England 12 years ago and good Indian food has been one of the few things I have missed because other Indian restaurants we have tried in Phoenix never quite lived up to expectations. This restaurant did, the food was excellent and the service very good. We were there on a Wednesday evening and did not make a reservation but the manager warned us that if we wanted to eat there at the weekend we should definitely make a reservation. We will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Marigold Maison is a very good Indian Cuisine restaurant. The service is great, and the food is really good. They have many types of different naan( the Indian flatbread ), and they have many different kinds of spices. The one thing I would recommend is to make a reservation. Can get packed very quickly sometimes."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, excellent service, a real treat if you are fond of Indian food.  The staff is very good about making sure that you are clear on the different levels of \"hot curry.\"  The lunch \"sampler\" is really good and gives one a great idea of the variety of this cuisine.  A definte \"keeper\""}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food that I have had!  I hadn't been there prior to their remodel but now I can see why they needed to expand.   Their new bar and open front area are a great addition to their fantastic food.  I had lamb with butter sauce and it was likely the most tender, delicious lamb that I have had.  My girlfriend had chicken korma and it was equally delicious.  This was after we started with Sea Scallops which were huge and cooked to perfection.  Add to the amazing food, our very attentive waiter, Abe, and it was an unbelievable experience for our first time there.  Also, the main chef/owner came out to check on us and that was a very nice touch.   All of the help was very friendly and accommodating!   We will certainly be back many times!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food! Clean, friendly, great service, with attention to all the details. The Korma is the Gold in Marigold. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Taken a huge step backwards   Went there for lunch and the menu has changed.  No hot chai - prices gone up AND now they add 20% for service for a party of four.   I believe in tipping well but at my discretion.   This was lot a huge party or a four star restaurant where one comes to accept that practice.    The menu clearly states that the tali plate come with naan but we were told 'not so for the vegan one!'    Two salads on the menu.  One for $14 with salad and one for $15 with shrimp. So I asked for the first one with shrimp.  Turned out to $17.   So the food is still good but these changes are not positive and change the regular visits of the past to history."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to find in Phoenix! I frequent the Marigold Maison in the Chicago area, so I knew it was a destination place to have a team business dinner while in Phoenix. The food is fabulous, the staff is willing to accommodate your needs and the price was right. The hand painted walls are a tasteful work of art.  Our group chose to order many dishes and taste them all.  This is a great recommendation because we had a taste of India feast."}
{"text":"This was just okay. Went for lunch, and the cauliflower appetizer was very good, but entrees so-so. We both had the thali lunches, one veggie and one chicken. Lukewarm. Given that the lunch choices are very limited, I'm assuming that the thali items are ready to serve, so it's unclear why they weren't hot. Also, the spicy heat was lacking, as was the flavor. Too bad, we were looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"A South Asian with a 40 plus year history in the valley,  I would  feign ignorance (\"Sorry I am not an expert \") when asked for    recommendations  of Indian restaurants. The restaurants in the valley  were uneven, inconsistent  and rarely approaching  good fare found in  in big  sea board cities . Now  with some assurance I  can answer the question  with the insight that friends presume I derive from   my DNA.    Three  recent experiences at Marigold Maison  were consistent and   all worthy of 5 stars. Exceptional food and drink, fresh seafood and truly authentic fare. South Indian Dosa and Pooris , Curries from various geographic  ancestries , prepared by a chef  who should have a place at James Beard's table. ( If there is such an exalted place ). Be sure to individualize  the spice level-like you do with Thai - and you have a  dishes that you can  adopt and recommend  without hesitation."}
{"text":"The curry is to die for!! The tea is sweet and spicy. I always want to eat here- it is such a treat. One of my favorite restaurants in the greater Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Incredible Indian food. My waiter Rohit was great explaining the menu. I had the chicken tica and the lamb with rice and a garlic naan.  Exllent dinning experience."}
{"text":"Food was FANTASTIC!!  My husband and I eat a lot of Indian food, and this was by far some of  the best.  Stopped there for lunch with a Groupon.   We each received a tray with all kinds of different dishes.  Super fresh and savory.  Waiter was extremely  nice, very attentive, and  very cheerful.  (You don't find that too often).   Indian pop music was a little too loud for me, although my husband liked it that way.   Tables were too small and close together for two people.  Good thing the place wasn't too crowded for lunch.   If  they open a second location in Mesa (please do!) we would eat there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My wife and I flipped a coin between Salty Sow (I've been there before and love it) and Marigold (a place I haven't been).  As soon as we walked up, there was no host to greet us. We wait a minute and a host seats us on the patio. Including us, there are 3 other parties on the patio: my family, a group of four, and another group of four.  The waiter was ignoring us while the other two parties had drinks and appetizers brought to their table. As we're sitting there waiting for service, I see this guy dressed in black hurry into the restaurant (the patio is next to the entrance). A few minutes later, he comes out introduces himself as our waiter.   I'm guessing that our original waiter knew that he gave us horrible service and shuffled us off to the second waiter.  After we ate, we had to wait another 10 minutes for the bill. There was no offer for dessert or post-dinner drinks.  I will say that the food is good. My lamb chops were actually really good. Just keep an expectation for weak customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Indian Food. Nothing Frozen, everything freshly made to order. The auroma, says about the freshly grounded spices.  The minute the plate was on my table till I finished it, I did not utter a single word nor cared for people around.  Mesmerized !!!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food with excellent service. Our server Wesley was amazing!! Visiting Phoenix from CT and decided to check out the highest rated Indian restaurant on yelp...true to their ratings--holy crap--this place ROCKS.  Ordered the chicken thali which was like a huge round plate with separate sections for chicken tikka masala, chicken saag, naan, rice, daal and rice pudding! What a steal!! Oh and their happy hour is from 11 to 6p with $6 PITCHERS of beer! Holy crap is this place for real?! Can you open one in CT?! I feel like I robbed them. I'LL BE BACK like Arnold Schwarzenegger!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Indian food that cooked with soul, this is the place to go. Everything about our experience here tonight was fabulous.   We ordered the Lamb chops and a Chicken Saag Spinach. A great combo to share with two. They provided a complimentary papadum basket for a apparently standard 15 min wait to make the chops. The mint chutney was delicious, and who am I to complain about complimentary papadum?  The chef also went out of his way to make an off-the-menu-dish when I described a particular roti I have eaten elsewhere in the past. This was spectacular - even better than the naan I'd say and perfect for eating with the saag spinach.   Our waitress, Gena, was very friendly and helpful to select our dishes. The rest of the staff was courteous and attentive.   I'm really glad to find this gem in my neighborhood. The waitress spoke the absolutely truth when we initially arrived and discovered it was our first visit to the restaurant, saying \"You will definitely come back again\"."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at. Maybe they were having a bad night, but the food was atrocious.  I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and the color of the Masala looked like light brown dog food.  The taste was super bland and I could only eat about one third of the meal before throwing it out.  The chicken was dry, chewy and far from any kind of tenderness. We also had the Chicken Tikka and the chicken was also the same, hard and chewy. Super disappointing meal!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and for a good price! It was also nice to sit outside. They had some good menu options! The staff was slightly off, but they were friendly and didn't bug us when we stayed late."}
{"text":"YUM!  This place is great!  Have been a few times now and the food is well seasoned and no 'weird/secret' sauces to hide the flavor of the food.  Staff is efficient and very courteous.  We'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, but hadn't found any good Indian restaurants in Phoenix. After hearing Marigold Maison has the same owner as Roka Akur (and the same investor as Nobuo at Teeter House), I had to try it.   I went here for the first time back in September or October and immediately became a regular. The food is outstanding! Every dish we've tried has been incredible...extremely fresh, flavorful and awesome quality of meat/seafood. The rice and naan are fantastic and we also love the tofu appetizer and chickpea \"ceviche\". My husband is a huge fan of the chicken curry - and I'm just a huge fan of all it all! We crave it almost nightly!   Andy, Abraham, Rohit, and Suneil are such gracious hosts and we always enjoy our conversation with them. Also, I'm not a big fan of leftovers, but this food tastes even better (if that's possible) the next day. Definitely try Marigold Maison! It's SO good!"}
{"text":"Just ok, pretty expensive for Indian food and I prefer a little more authentic, it was not as flavorful as I would have liked."}
{"text":"We're from London England (also known as the curry capital of the world) and we LOVED Marigold! Totally unexpected authentic Indian food.   Our server Pushpa (ironically used to live in London) and we really enjoyed speaking with her.   Great service, great wine, and great food! Get the masala dosa and chicken tikka masala for sure!"}
{"text":"My in-laws rave about this place, so we were excited to go.  And it was...nice.  Friendly staff, clean, pleasant atmosphere.  The samosas certainly had promise, hot and with three good sauces.  But the lamb in the saag was very overcooked, and since this is one of my favorite dishes, I couldn't help but be disappointed.  The korma with shrimp was good, but $22 for 6 shrimp?  OK.  So yeah, nice.  I think I'll save my Indian cravings for Tandoori Times though."}
{"text":"First time to Marigold Maison and will definitely be back.  Have searched all over Phoenix for great Indian food and have finally found it!  Love southern Indian given lots of good heat and spice.  Had the Dosa Masala (outstanding) and Lamb Vindaloo (equally outstanding).  Gina was our server and she was phenomenal.  A true asset to Marigold!  Thanks for an outstanding meal - we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just found this little gem of a place.  The service was great and food is the real-deal. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is the only place that serves really nice lunch thali, and we order it every time. I want to try other stuffs on their menu too."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I love Indian food.  I generally prefer lunch buffets because of all the variety.  However, I do know what I like so going out for Indian dinner is just fine, too.  My husband and our baby boy decided last minute to try out Marigold Maison. In terms of the food- it was ok.  The garlic naan was delicious. We had the paneer pakora for an appetizer- it was pretty good.  Most Indian restaurants that I have been to for dinner bring the condiments (tamarind, onion chutney, and mint chutney) on the side. The pakoras came with the sauces drizzled on the plate- an attempt to be fancy, I think. I prefer the sauces on the side because I like to eat them with the bread and my entree.  My entree, the vegetable korma, was ok- it was a little bland in comparison to other Indian restaurants.  My husband thought the lamb chops were really good.  We enjoy going out to eat and while great food is number one on the priority list for choosing restaurants, we also appreciate a nice ambiance, as well as excellent service.  I have been a waitress many times, so I tend to be more on the empathetic side of servers.  Tonight, I was digging deep and, really, the only thing I have nice to say is that the people working there seemed kind.  They were really terrible at time management and knowing how to take care of their tables, however.  We sat down on the patio and it took about 10-15 minutes to take our drink order. The table who sat down after us got their drinks, ordered an appetizer, and received their appetizer all before the 2nd waiter came to take care of us.  Waiter #1 was so flustered with what appeared to be a few tables, so he passed us on to Waiter #2.  We thought it was going to get better from there, but we were wrong.  It took our new waiter forever to bring us our check.  We never even got refills on water.  Bottom line- it's a small restaurant and we were forgotten about from the point of entry.  The food was just average, so due to the terrible service, we will not return."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and ordered idli & samosa- they served 2 small sized frozen idli & samosa not even completed heated!!  Feels like an over prized place for under quality food. Very very bad quality.  Never going to come back here at all."}
{"text":"I have had better and the Chicken Korma tasted more like Curry chicle the lentil soup was like paste. It was expensive and not very good. I have had better Indian."}
{"text":"Being Gluten Free often leaves going out to dinner very limited & often disappointing. But not here, was our first visit, definitely not our last.  Love love love that there are so many gluten free options & clearly noted.  I can't remember the last time I had TO many options when eating out. Service far exceeded any experience in the area. Atmosphere was just perfect. The food is just a holiday for the taste buds. Tyvm Gina for all the explanation"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! The manager is always really friendly, the servers are nice, and this place has great Indian food (coming from someone who was raised on Indian cooking) I highly suggest this place to anyone looking for a great Indian, dining experience. The place is a bit small but they're expanding very soon!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is awesome! from the food to the service everything was fantastic. I will definately be coming back. The Naan bread was the best part it was hot and delicious. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Best Indian food! Fantastic service. The scallops melted in my mouth. If you haven't been here, stop in immediately."}
{"text":"Marigold is by far the best Indian restaurant in my opinion. The food is always well seasoned and has an authentic touch with finesse.  The paneer tikka is my favorite appetizer. It's sizzling with freshness and a lot of flavor. For main course, I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, dal tadka, and mattar paneer. All 3 are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spices making the dish absolutely delicious.  Service is great! Pushpa and Abhrahim kill it when it comes to service. Very friendly and welcoming. Hats off to Chef Sunil!"}
{"text":"I am so thankful we stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant. We are lovers of Indian cuisine and I must say we just ate the best Indian food ever. The flavors were unique and delicious. The meat was so tender and fresh. The portions were perfect. Everything felt light and healthy.  The service was better than Ive ever experienced. We ate at closing time and every employee had a huge smile on their face. The manager and chef took the time introduced themselves. I was blown away by their desire to make our night special.  This was truly a dining experience like no other, from start to finish. Id give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Just moved to town and trying to find a go-to Indian restaurant. Unfortunately I could only describe the flavors here as strangely bland. I tried the vindaloo, curry, garlic naan, onion naan, and samosas. The samosas were great, but when I think about it I cant recall ever having a bad one; they must be easy. The naan was only ok. Then the entrees were just blah, bland and uninteresting which is the antithesis of what I expect from Indian food.  Overall the food was only ok, so I would not go back. There has to be some great Indian restaurants here, just have to keep trying!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and loved it. Flash fried veggie appetizer was delicious. So was the entree with naan, lentils, chicken tikka masala, and rice pudding. Great service. Nice surroundings. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Expensive place. Quality is good most of the times. Thali is outrageously priced for nothing."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have been meaning to pop in and try Marigold Maison for lunch for quite some time now.  This place had always seemed to slip my mind when trying to decide where to go.  However, I assure you that will not happen again.  We stopped in today and were blown away.  The food was SO good... great flavors, perfect textures and good portions.  The wait staff was very attentive, helpful and friendly - as was the Manager.  I understand there can be quite a wait for dinner - so you'll need to be smart and make a reservation or plan well ahead to order take out -  but the wait will be well worth it.  This will be my Go To when I'm in the PV area from here forward!"}
{"text":"This place really surpassed our expectations. We had been wanting to stop by, and I'm so happy we finally did. We were greeted really fast and very friendly as soon as we walked in, and we got our choice to sit anywhere that was available. I'm thinking the manager or maybe even owner is the one who greeted us and seated us. He was really nice. It was pretty full. We went on a Tuesday evening, and they offer a couples' special for 69.00.   The prices are decent, and the food is beyond delicious! The menu has a lot of options, and is very complete; from appetizers, entrees, sides, drinks, cocktails, and desserts. Everything was better than we expected! We really wanted to try a dessert, but we were stuffed.  Our waitress was really good! She was nice, gave us recommendations, and checked on us just the right amount of time. The overall experience was superb. Can't wait to go back.   Glad this authentic Indian Cuisine little gem exists in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place probably is the worst Indian place I have been to, and I have been to a lot of them. The two stars I gave are for the atmosphere and the set up, but the food is a big thumbs dawn. No real authentic flavors and the taste is so bland. The price is also higher than all Indian Resturant's I know in the Phoenix area. I may be a little hard on them but I was truly looking forward to trying this place after I saw many good reviews but unfortunately I left very disappointed. May be people who gave higher reviews were impressed by the clean and  nice environment which I admit better than many other Indian Resturant's, though The food is way lagging behind. For me it was once and done and I wouldn't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up. Lamb chops & chicken tandoori, garlic naan and lemon rice. It was tender, perfectly cooked and flavored. Simply amazing. This place was a little pricey, but completely worth it. Best Indian food I've had anywhere, including NY & LA. Wow. That's all I can say. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business and looking for someplace different for dinner. Went here with colleagues and we all agreed this was the best place we had been to in the past week. Very authentic dishes and reasonably priced. If you are a fan of Indian cuisine give this a try."}
{"text":"Went looking for the ole Bombay Spice when we stumbled upon this place. We had an excellent time!  The food is delicious! Our waiter gave amazing suggestions and was attentive and friendly.  Fun inventive drinks. We were just going to take our food to go but decided to stay after such a warm welcome at the door. Fantastic, we'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered from here a few days ago. We had the vindaloo, biryani, samosas, mixed vegetables, and onion kulcha. The food was extremely salty...including the Mango Salad. It would be great if they would let the real flavors of the food shine through, instead of masking them with so much sodium. We threw the majority of it away...very disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful restaurant the service is exceptional the food was amazing this is a must stop by and see we are very pleased with this whole experience"}
{"text":"They make yummy food!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their lamb chops and all their paneer dishes! Nice, contemporary décor."}
{"text":"Great food and solid service. The manager must have worked in fine dining, nice attention to detail. Nice outdoor patio with heaters. Good value considering the ambiance, service and quality/taste of the food. Tried several different items on a platter and they were all good. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Servers and the chef, Sunil Kumar, are all so nice, and attentive; the food is wonderful!  I even love the smell of spice when I walk through the door.  LOVE the lamb thali platter for the wonderful variety."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this food! My husband and I moved to Arizona a few years ago from Seattle. We love the weather but really miss good ethnic food. After trying  4 other Indian restaurants we ended up here...WOOT!  We have only had food delivered so I am unable to say what the premises look like but I can tell you that they make the best Saag Paneer we have every had."}
{"text":"Marigold Maison is a wonderful magical place.  A small little patch of heaven in an area that is far to commercialized, strip mall laden, and devoid of unique mom and pop operations.  There are quite a few options for Indian food in the valley and I am sure there are some that are as good as this wonderful establishment, but I haven't found them yet.  The staff is courteous and professional all while having an air of casual friendliness.  I found the manager (perhaps owner) to be very nice and obviously concerned with the dining experience and the quality of the food.  The restaurant has various specials and events such as their weekly Tuesday \"Date Night\" where you can get a three course meal and a bottle of wine for a very reasonable price.  Let us discuss the food... oh the food.  The tikka masala I had was the best I have had in phoenix.  It was euphoric and could not have been tastier.  For people who understand and love food, there is an ecstasy that certain foods can give you.  A natural high that takes you to a mental place where all the difficulties of the world fade away and all the is left is joy, peace, and deliciousness in your mouth.  I get this feeling with Thai food, Korean BBQ, and the tikka masala from Marigold Maison.  The garlic non was delicious (though our had one edge that was a little burned) and so good.  The rice didn't have saffron but that is understandable given the price range.  But these are small things; things that do nothing to tarnish the luster of excellence that permeates this establishment.  If you love Indian food, love a good deal, and are a hunter of that euphoric food experience, you owe it to yourself to try out Marigold Maison.  I would say that we need to do our best to keep this place in business but from the times I have eaten here they are always busy as it is =)  Maybe make a reservation before coming."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim and happy I did. Sat outside because the weather was beautiful and the inside seemed small and hot. The wait staff was super friendly and attentive and, because the menu is slightly different from some more traditional places, the server explained how things come out and portion sizes, which was helpful.  Lentil soup was pretty bland and came out warm, not hot. Samosas were great and came out extremely hot. Chicken tikka masala was the entree and it was really good, but not the best I've ever had. This place is worth trying."}
{"text":"I was craving samosa chaat,  found it here and a wonderful Shrimp Korma and Lamb Vindaloo! The food made my heart smile :)!"}
{"text":"We heard of this place on yelp and decided to try it. The place is very pretty, the service is excellecent and the food is just phenomenal. One dish came out a bit burnt and they reqdily remade it for us at no extra charge. The biryani is really good.  The owner and the chef make a point of coning out to talk to you.....overall a great ambiance.  The menu is very diverse and lots to choose from for both veggies and non-veggies.  Kids get crayons and drawing paper....which is always such a bonus since it keeps them occupied! Overall....terrific experience."}
{"text":"It isn't real Indian food.  I thought the food was unusually sweet, like they were putting too much sugar in it, which is a trick restaurants use to get you to like otherwise average food.  Nice atmosphere.  Iced tea was really good.  Salad greens were not super fresh.  Chicken was sparse in Tikka Masala.  Cooked vegetables were overcooked. Raita was soooo sweet I couldn't eat it.  There are a bunch of 5 star reviews, but be careful, because they are offering gift certificates for Yelp reviews. They had a \"restaurant consultant\" there who was driving the turnaround of this place, which is by the same people who did the failed Bombay Spice.  They are definitely playing the Yelp game.  I am not saying this place was terrible or anything... just not remotely authentic and pretty average despite all the pumped up Yelp reviews.  I would give it 3 stars were it not for all the Yelp gaming they are doing, which for me knocks it down another star."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service.  Go with any paneer item and you will not be disappointed. Naans' are must have. Do not skip that kulfi. Mango and raspberry both beat any competition.   Skip vindaloo curries and lemon rice. They did not taste that good."}
{"text":"As advertised, the food was great. We had 3 entrees and 4 appetizers and everything except the grilled eggplant was good. Not that it was bad but it was a little plain and could have used some spices. Otherwise the food, service, location and ambience was great. Some people said price was too high but I felt it was reasonable. I will go back fro sure."}
{"text":"Great experience and wonderful food. The management was welcoming and the service was exceptional. Great to have a place with a tandoor oven and the chicken tikka was very tasteful. Friend found out why the pork chops come highly recommended."}
{"text":"Second time and another fantastic meal!  Authentic with wonderful service, recommend to anyone that truly enjoys Indian Cuisine!"}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing out of the ordinary. My he reason why I give two stars is simply because of the wait. We place on online order we got there 15 minutes after placing it. The restaurant was empty as I walk in to pick up i was told that by the employee that it would be between 10 and 20 minutes . So anyways after a 40 minute wait we got out food when it was place online and was promise a 10 15 minute wait ."}
{"text":"Just ate here. It was delicious!! We are from out of town but love Indian food and eat it often. The flavors were impeccable! The lentil crepes are so beautifully put together. And a word to you as a diner-- try all the sauces!! Will definitely dine here again when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Some dishes like the Medu vada and Chicken Makhani were quite good, the naans were crisp and filling and the service was helpful and attentive.   However, the Dosa was completely soggy. And the Sambar with the dosa was spiceless. The restaurant was kind enough to take it off the bill.   All in all, a bit disappointing but the manager has promised to improve- so will try and come back."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!!! Go for lunch though, not dinner. They raise the prices and it's the same food!?! The menu price has also in erased in the last year. The service and food are amazing though!!!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Phoenix and I just loved the place and delicious food. And there goes five stars from my end.."}
{"text":"This is not the usual Indian restaurant. I would say, this is more of a fine dining restaurant, so you get gourmet food. Name of the foods are Indian, but these are American version of Indian food"}
{"text":"Great food. Great sever. Jeffrey was kind, very knowledgeable about the menu and worked to assist us when we had a special request. Love the military discount. Thank you for your support of the US military. Will be back no doubt."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating Indian food and the whole staff made us feel really great about trying new things and helping us along the way.  The food was AMAZING!  We ordered the Tikka Masala and the Fish of the day and they were both very flavorful and super tasty!  We also tried the garlic naan which was out of this world!  We liked it so much we signed up for the rewards program because we will definitely be coming back!  I would totally recommend this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant many times and have always enjoyed it. Also have been in large groups and never had a problem being served. This the first time we have gone since they enlarged and maybe they bit off more than they can chew. We arrived for a 5:30 reservation and were promptly seated, brought menus, and order the $49 per person Valentine's day special. They brought our drinks and a little plate with condiments .... and then we sat and sat and sat. People near us who came after us were served. 45 minutes went by and my husband said something to the server and she apologized - we waited 10 more minutes and again complained to the server. She brought the manager who apologized, offered to comp us and said they had been slammed by take-out orders. Nice to know take-out comes before actual diners. They then brought the food which was all lukewarm so we asked it to be bagged up -- we then received a bill for $40 which we paid with a $10 tip -- yes we were comped some of it but it was a horrible dining experience and we will not be back and we will let our friends of which there are many that go there about our experience as well. There are plenty of other Indian restaurants to take our business to."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service by  Gina she is amazing, I recommend this place, I'm addicted to it."}
{"text":"Marigold was excellent   Service was only exceeded by the great food. Everything we ate we loved  If you're an Indian food fan, absolutely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Today I had the chicken Teaka masala lamb biryani and the shrimp korma and the service was excellent"}
{"text":"For someone who's NEVER been a fan of Indian food I've got to give kudos to this great spot! Food was absolutely fantastic and the service was excellent. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar and admittedly my expectations were low... To my surprise, the food was delicious [we ordered the garlic bread thing-a-mabobber, along with a lamb and a shrimp dish, which were both fantastic!]. Our bartender/server, Abraham, was great and he suggested some excellent wines to pair with our meals. I'm now admittedly a fan of Indian food and will certainly be a repeat customer of this gem of a eatery!"}
{"text":"Miserable job packing our food. Bag exploded walking in.  Curry everywhere.  Hours of cleaning. $200 shoes destroyed. Hassle beyond relief. Food was remade and properly packed second time.   NEVER AGAIN. DISGUSTING MESS DUE TO SLOTH AND INDIFFERENCE."}
{"text":"Delicious. What else can I say. The vegetarian Tikka Masala with cheese was incredible. If I could I would lick the sauce off that bowl. All the dishes we tried had incredible seasoning and flavor. Thanks you to Abraham for the great recommendations. we will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"The chickpea ceviche was fantastic. The Vindaloo chicken - spicy, just the way I like it. Rohit provided great recommendations. We'll be back."}
{"text":"First night in town visiting a friend and she wanted to take me to a vegan friendly restaurant so she recommended this place. I love that there menu is clearly marked with all their vegan options. It made it so easy to navigate. John, our server was also very knowledgeable and accommodating. They were out of Kanji Lemonade but the server recommended the Nimbu Pani which he says was more like lemonade. It was perfect. Nice, light and refreshing -- not too sweet. To eat I ordered the Tumeric Lentil Soup, Mango Salad, and Kabuli Chana. So much food I had enough for dinner the next day. Everything was absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have had in Phoenix. It is a little bit pricey, but you get what you pay for!! Great service, ambiance and great tasting food. We tried vegetarian items and it was delicious. I can't wait to visit this place again."}
{"text":"I CANNOT say enough about this place  The first and only restaurant I've ever enjoyed Indian cuisine at, and I doubt I'll go anywhere else. I always bring my friends who have never tried this food and everyone loves it. The atmosphere is great, the drinks are amazing and the service is even better. The owners and staff are so helpful with their guidance, you are guaranteed to love whatever you get. Go there today!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, always busy, spice is a party in your mouth.   We have been here a few times, the food is always flavorful, served hot, with a nice wait staff. I am partial to the chicken vindaloo - the spice has a kick, but just excellent. The dish is a perfect portion, if you enjoy some pre-dinner treats, there is enough to take home.   Prices are about 10% too high, a bit pricey for dinner for two with some wine and beer.   I see they have delivery service now available - great add to the service.  We will have food delivered very soon.   Favors are exceptional."}
{"text":"Amazing food, enough good options for vegetarians and gluten free needs. Very nice staff. Would totally recommend folks to eat here. The only thing I would like to see is more vegan gf options and a bigger place. If they did that I'd likely quit cooking at home and eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Delish! Sat at the bar. Our server Abraham gave us complimentary suggestions. Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Read good reviews so went to order a takeout. Ordered their most expensive lamb sheekh.The seekh got burnt in the oven, over burnt. But that didn't stop them from packing it knowing it was a takeout. Highly unprofessional and cheap mentality. Will never go back.  Update - The manager contacted me after my review and issued a refund. So they get some brownie points for customer service. I will still be careful IF(that's a big if) I go there again and order a takeout. I would check the food before I leave."}
{"text":"What a GREAT find. Fantastic food and great staff. Getting Mom out and trying new foods. 1st time she's had Indian cuisine. We started off with Garlic Naan then she had Tikka Masala and I had Biryani Hyderabadi. Every dish was explained to her by our waiter and boy were they fantastic. We'll definitely be going back SOON !!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for environment. Very clean, tasteful decor. But in a strip mall.   Good indian food. Not the best I've ever had, coming from the Bay Area. But solid food quality. Not the best value. But is probably my go to indian restaurant. Delhi palace and udupi cafe are a little too far unfortunately."}
{"text":"Food has been very good both times we've been there. The service has been spotty, however. On our second visit, we were seated for 10-15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and it took 45 minutes for our food to come out. The manager did come to our table to apologize and tell us that they were inundated with online orders, but it still keeps them from getting 5 stars. Also, the prices are a little high. We always leave with leftovers though, so that is nice. We'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best Indian food around. Tikka Masala is a must. Butter Shrimp is amazing. Garlic naan is perfection. Perfect for dining in and also for delivery/takeout."}
{"text":"Yep, Im a fan great food , service and atmosphere. The happy hour is one of the best in the valley. I like my indian food spicy, so Id like to see them offer different levels of spiciness when ordering. Not sure if thesis an option with Indian food. Overall a great place, keep it going Marigold!"}
{"text":"Gosh I can't stop eating at this place. We love it and eat there at least once a week or two. Chicken tikka masala is to die for. Just make sure when you ask for it spicy, you say \"I want it spicy, please make sure it's spicy\". It's hit or miss with the spicy factor. Other than that, so good. Samosa is also darn delicious."}
{"text":"Outstanding. I have been here probably 20 times or more for lunch over the past 2 years. It's my go-to place to take new people from work or new clients. Fantastic Indian food! I love the lunch platters because you get to try a little bit of everything.  I have been here once or twice for dinner, and I'd like to go back for more. Very happy this place is here -- I was used to tremendous Indian food when I lived in NYC, and this place in Phoenix does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This was the blandest Indian food I have ever had.  It tasted watered down.  And yet, still managed to give me indigestion!  Not sure how they pulled that off.  We started with Vegetable Pakora - which everywhere else is nice bite size pieces of chile, onion, califlower, etc., but at Marigold Maison was like the small pieces remaining in a bag of potato chips.  They were such small pieces that you couldn't even dip them in the chutney - you had to scoop some \"pakora\" and toss it into your mouth, then scoop some chutney and shove it in.  We also had the Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Both sauces were so bland, it was like Italian food.  And the  Naan was over cooked so that half of it was basically a cracker - not a good springy bread that could soak up a sauce, like naan should be.  The prices were outrageous for the quality and quantity provided.  We had 1 appetizer, 2 orders of naan, 2 entrees and 4 beers - bill came to $85 before tip.  Also, server tried to take away our entree bowls before we were done.  I guess he thought that since we ate the 8 or so pieces of meat, that we were done.  I eat Indian food for the  SAUCE.  But I guess since the sauce really sucked that many of the customers at Marigold Maison just leave it.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The staff makes an effort to open the door for everyone.  They look you in the eye with a smile and heart felt greeting. As soon as you enter,  the aroma is absolutely devine. The menu is extensive enough yet not overwhelming. We had the Chicken Curry,  Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan. All entrées come with bottomless Basmati Rice. All were extremely flavorful with excellent texture. The medium heat is not real spicy so I would suggest the hot for those that like to feel it for a while after dinner. Our meal for 2,  with iced tea, was $40. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"\"The search is over, love was right before my eyes\"  Journey.  That's how I feel about this place because I have driven by the place multiple times, cause I enjoy shopping at sprouts which is around the corner.  The place is a gem, diamond standard!  If you want to get out and try something different and challenge your taste buds, then this is the place to go!  They have amazing food, great customer service, and a beautifully decorated restaurant.  This place is a must try!  I descended upon this restaurant during a weeknight.  My wife and I ordered the tandoori wings, samosa, and chicken tikka.  All three dishes were amazing! The wings were big and flavorful.  As you know, I'm a big wing fan, and these were some of the best I've had.  The samosa was very flavorful and the chicken tikka was cooked perfectly  The service also was top notch.  The waitress was very accommodating and very attentive.  She had a friendly personality and even made some recommendations to us.  It's nice to see when people enjoy their job.  Overall, this place is as good as it gets.  The prices were really reasonable, great service, and outstanding food, a true trifecta in the food industry.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anybody.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!  Thomas"}
{"text":"This place has the best Indian food in Arizona! I've been trying so many different locations and finally found my favorite! You can watch them make your dish from scratch through the open kitchen and get a house made chai or mango lassie to go with it. Definitely eating here again soon! Yum"}
{"text":"We discovered this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago and have brought back different groups of guests. On our last visit, we ordered 3 dinner entrees and 2 appetizers. One of the entrees was supposed to be medium spice. After one sampling it was clear to us that it was not edible. All spice no taste. Not once did our waitress ask us how the food was. At one point we flagged her down to ask if there was a mistake to which she responded with \"That IS medium. Hot is even hotter.\" So the dish sat there untouched, we didn't even take a doggie bag home. We weren't offered the opportunity to replace the $20 dish. Nothing. All said, this visit was a disappointment. If you're going to be overpriced, you have to be just a little more accommodating."}
{"text":"Marigold Maison's food and service are wonderful, and the atmosphere is very welcoming.  We've been here several times and we never have had a bad meal or experience.  The chicken and lamb tikka marsala are my favorites, and they pair nicely with the garlic naan.  The prices are very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"My first time here & really first time at an Indian cuisine restaurant. We had the Tiki Massala Chicken & Saag Spinach Shrimp with a side of Marigold Naan. The food was delish! The Marigold Mule was yummy too! The service was spot on and I love the indoor/outdoor bar."}
{"text":"I've found such a love for Indian food and heard good things about this joint so we headed over to check it out.   Even though we were there ten minutes after they opened on a Wednesday the place filled quickly, good sign.  Our service was very good, efficiently quick which worked out as we has things to do  I ordered the chicken thali player and was delighted by some new dishes. Both the saag and masala were full of flavor and cooked well, the rice pudding was a nice sweet palate cleanser between the two of those dishes, the lentil soup was good, and the papadum was an awesome crunchy side to dip in the success along with the fresh naan. Hubby had the chicken tikka that for a man that can eat for two was slightly too much food! That's hard to find Bursting with the flavours of India we were both so happy with this discovery"}
{"text":"I've never been \" bold\" or excited about Indian food. I assumed everything was curry, curry and more curry.  My friend invited me to this restaurant and I was eager to eat with an experienced devotee of Indian cuisine.  First of all, our waiter could not have been more pleasant and helpful. He was patient and answered every question I had.  Secondly, the restaurant is clean and lovely. Not loud. No distracting music. Service was great. Lastly. The food!!! To. Die. For. I'm a confirmed fan. The nuances of mint, chile, cumin, etc. the Naan!!! Every bite was an explosion of flavor.  Great experience. I can't  wait to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely never going there again. Very in-authentic Indian catering to the folks who have probably never tried Indian food. Kanji lemonade - not only had no kanji, it had no fresh squeezed lemon. it was just Hi-c.  Samosas were soooo bland and made from tortilla. Garlic naan was cold, burnt - how can one mess up on naan?!  Ordered spicy version of saag paneer - same bland taste as other mild dishes. Achar was dry and old. All in all - complete waste of money, time and taste."}
{"text":"This restaurant nailed it for us on service, fresh and delicious food, portion size and price. Our little group of three went for lunch to Marigold Maison on a weekday. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess and invited to sit wherever we'd like. Water was filled immediately and the service was outstanding, friendly and warm.  The platter offers a sampling of a few items and is a good way to go if you are unfamiliar with Indian food. Both the platter and the chicken kati roll were outstanding.  The flavors are fresh, tasty without being over seasoned, and if you like spicy don't be afraid to get hot.  This native Arizonan went for medium and found little to no heat - but I didn't miss the spice, as all the flavors blended together so well.  It was a completely unexpected treat to have cuisine that tasted this good in town.  Would love to have this restaurant in N. Scottsdale.  Prices were completely reasonable and portion size was perfect.  View the menus on their site:  http://www.marigoldmaison.com/   A totally refreshing and enjoyable experience - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place. If we are craving for an Indian food, this place is our go to restaurant. Food is palatable and the service is always excellent. The staff are always knowledgeable and helpful if you don't know what to eat or order. They'll give you suggestions on what to eat and etc."}
{"text":"I was amazed with my experience here. My girlfriend orders the lamb chicken Marsala and I had the chicken Vindaloo. Well her lamb was delicious and my chicken was sub par, so naturally I ate all of hers. The waitress noticed my untouched plate and comped it off the bill and offered to make me something else. I will definitely give this place another chance"}
{"text":"Guys your online menu and your pricing in person are extremely different. We don't mind paying the higher price but no one seemed to care that the website misled us on what our take out would cost.  Their response was, \"oh yeah we've heard the prices online are different.\" UMM WELL IF YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE BEING MISLEAD WHY AREN'T EVEN TRYING TO FIX IT....."}
{"text":"Was taken here for my birthday a few weeks ago because my favorite food is Indian Food! It was tasty, generous servings, had good service, and I liked the decor/feel of the place. Good location also. Want to return to try some more things; everything on the menu looked good!"}
{"text":"The food was 5-stars but the experience was ruined when a really intoxicated customer (take out order) came in. As he was waiting for his food he did have an alcoholic drink even though he was clearly too drunk and legally should not have been served.  He was screaming across the restaurant asking Stephanie (the waitress) if she even \"put the order in\" he said that he will make \"a scene\" (in this day and age that could be anything including some really scary stuff) and yelled at a baby that was crying. He was making the entire restaurant uncomfortable but neither Stephanie nor a manager made any attempts to make the restaurant feel safe and welcoming to the dozen or so other customers that were equally annoyed and/or scared. The fact that he was served showed to me that the manager does not care about the law whatsoever.  After he was given his food he gave a hug to Stephanie and  then squeezed her ass cheeks right in the middle of the restaurant. I was trying to have a nice relaxing dinner with my husband and not view a woman waitress get sexually harassed at her work place! Again, the manager was apathetic and did not put an end to it.  When my husband asked Stephanie \"was that guy for real?\" she seemed really confused as if screaming across a restaurant, yelling at a baby, being really intoxicated that you caused a scene and squeezing the ass cheeks of an employee is normal. Stephanie said that he was \"an old friend\" and didn't even apologize.     Even though the food was good we will stick to the numerous indian restaurants in Tempe and elsewhere.   Oh and before we even got the chance to look at the menu we were asked if we ever had Indian food before. I'm pregnant and even my fetus had indian food IN INDIA. Heck probably asked cause I'm white cause she didn't ask the Indians if they ever had Indian food."}
{"text":"I work across the at so I've been here many times for take out, tonight we decided to dine in for a date night and it was absolutely HORRIBLE!! The food is great, except I wouldn't order the chicken tandoori, not the usual and was on the dry side. Customer service sucked. No greeting, no water, no salt, no checking in to see how anything was, no sorry for the delay, nothing. I had to go inside and ask for a box and the check because they were taking so long, everything all together was just a disappointment tonight. Chicken Tikka is good here though. Stick to takeout."}
{"text":"I know of a great Indian place in northern ca. (Naan & curry in concord ca) ever since I moved out to Arizona one of my missions is to find delicious Indian food. The chicken tika masala is perfect, its not clumpy, the flavor isn't just heat, but actual flavor.. haha get me? In comparison to naan & curry no place was cutting it... Till I found this place. I live quite a ways away but this place is so worth it. So delicious ... Oh and I love how their naan is fluffy and not all thin and crispy.. Another important aspect! Yum yum I'm writing this at 2 am and am super sad they're not open late night ._.also only sad part is they're double the price. :( @ naan & curry I got my chicken tikka masala, two naans, and rice for 13 bucks! Here its like 30 :( but until I find that hole in the wall with great pricing.. I'll be going here :_:"}
{"text":"From the second I walked in the door I was amazed at the service and atmosphere. The manager was so kind and helpful with making sure we were having a great experience. Our waitress was very sweet. The place smelt incredible and normally I can't eat in an Indian restaurant best of the smells being so strong.   The food- If your looking for the perfect family style night out this is the place. We tried three different chicken dishes and all were beyond any Indian food I've ever had. The spices tasted fresh and full of the perfect flavor. It was honestly hard to stop eating because the portion sizes are large.  Cocktails- whom ever their bar tender is they make one amazing martini!    Will be returning here again!"}
{"text":"We came for restaurant week and their $33 dinner included either an all-you-can-eat Traditional (has meat) or Vegetarian Thali Platter. We tried both because variety is the spice of life!   The traditional platter consisted of shrimp tikka (grilled), lamb curry, chicken masala, and malai kofta (veggie cheese dumplings). The vegetarian platter consisted of chana masala (chickpea curry), saag paneer (spinach with cheese), malai kofta and paneer tikka (grilled cheese). Both platters also came with unlimited sides including: samosa, naan (you can also request garlic naan with no additional charge), papadum chips, basmati rice, lentil soup, quinoa salad, and rice pudding. The staff was incredibly attentive and kind. They were constantly refilling our dishes and water.  Everything was so delicious, very authentic and fresh! My favorite was the shrimp tikka, they definitely do not skimp on the shrimps, they're large and very succulent! I was also excited to learn that they would start having these all-you-can-eat platters every weekend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. You don't expect to the get authentic, quality Indian food in Phoenix but this place pulls it off.  First of all the service was impeccable. Our server gave us excellent and honest suggestions on which items to order and how to structure our dinner (some street food options to start then sauced and tandoori entrees to follow). He was knowledgable about the menu and extremely attentive. All of our questions were answered and our water glasses remained filled.   I recently traveled to South India and I haven't seen Dosa done so true to the authentic way. The coconut chutney was exactly like I had it in India and the Dosa itself was perfectly cooked. I rarely have good shrimp so I was skeptical of the Tandoor shrimp but I was totally wrong. It was tender and teeming with flavor. This is the \"must-get\" item on the menu (another server admitted he eats it every night) We also ordered the Punjabi Bharta (a great vegetarian option) and the eggplant had a perfect smoky flavor to it. The Goan Vindaloo was spicy and very tasty.  This place is awesome and we will certainly be back to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  This has long been one of our favorite restaurants as we love Indian food; we've eaten here over a dozen times..  THhs was our second visit after returning from a three week visit to India.  Everything tasted a bit flat.  The Dal Makhani was not as smooth or spicy as that in country.  The Massala and Korma were watery and WAY under spiced.  The Tandoori chicken was a disaster:  Covered with a gooey something.  The accompanying onions were actual cooked limp, not raw as with authentic.  It is my firm conviction, based on 40 years experience eating all over the world, that ethnic restaurants, to retain authenticity, must have a large clientele of first generation natives. Otherwise, the food becomes dumbed down to American tastes. [That' s why, for example, it is almost impossible to find the  good German food in the US I experienced living in Germany for three years.]  I hope this is not happening to Marigold Maison."}
{"text":"World-class. Our new favorite all-time Indian restaurant. Service and food is impeccable."}
{"text":"If there's anything I love as much as coffee... it's indian food.   This place is beyond legit. The food is authentic, amazing, and just so damn good. I'm a huge paneer fan, and omg. It's just really, really good here. Did I mention that it's good? lol I'll def be back"}
{"text":"Every time I've ordered takeout, when I go to pick it up the order was never sent through. Don't tell me it will be done in 10 minutes if you aren't even going to start the order til I get there. Very disappointing. If they are having problems with the computers or whatever they are blaming then they should communicate with the cooks and make sure the order was sent through. Also, I don't even go there at busy times and when I walk in, everyone is standing around. I don't think I will be going back again after approximately ten times this has happened."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix a couple of months ago and have been looking out for Indian restaurants. Marigold is by far my favorite. Good fresh food and great service."}
{"text":"Yum!!  Some of the best Marsala and samosas I've ever had!! They were very friendly and welcoming. Lunch menus were good and the food was excellent.  Lost a star because I had to constantly ask for water to be refilled even tho the restaurant was mostly empty. And their selection of \"Indian\" beers was nonexistent.  Otherwise, 5 stars!  Nice indoor and outdoor seating.  Fantastic! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley.  Their mango lassie is DELISCOUS!  Treat yourself with this sweet drink.  I'm very fussy when it comes to Indian food and this is not your run of the mill restaurant.  The food is much spicier than typical American-style Indian food (although much blander than authentic) and they have many options for vegetarians.  They are so amazing, they just expanded the restaurant a few months ago.  The new bar / happy hour area looks like it could be a modern sports bar.  It has a very unusual setup as half the bar is outside (under the awning) and the other half is inside.  For such a new restaurant, you know they are doing something right when they have to expand so quickly and are often busy.  Insider Tip!  Friday night and Saturday night, get a reservation.  They sometimes run out of tables or have a long wait."}
{"text":"The food was alright (except the dessert, which tasted like it had been frozen for too long, and was unevenly heated as though it had been microwaved). The service was good enough, but not outstanding. The place was clean, and the decor was not unpleasant (but it wasn't really very interesting either). All in all, it was ok, but the prices were higher than I would expect to pay for just ok. I've paid less for better elsewhere. From what I've been told, the prices are more reasonable at lunchtime."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 10 and they were so accommodating. Jeffrey our waiter was amazing! Very attentive the food is always tasty and flavorful. Will def come back."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. I have had the spinach saag, tandoori chicken, naan, eggplant. Every dish was better than the next. We also really enjoyed happy hour."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Indian Restaurant in the area.  Their food is a cut above most indian restaurants.  I love their Makhani curry.  Good atmosphere, nice staff.  Sometimes a little slow.  Wish their naan was a little thicker but theirs is pretty typical.  Definitely recommend overall."}
{"text":"I have finally found very good Indian cuisine in Phoenix. The food and service were excellent. The portion sizes are very substantial. I have had the Samosas and Chicken Korma two times and would recommend them."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3.5 stars....Seriously people...Let's talk. I feel like these Suberbanites taste buds might be a little lacking here...This will definitely hit the spot when you're craving some naan bread and masala sauce, but the flavors are so average here that I probably won't be back...There has to be better/more authentic Indian food in North Scottsdale somewhere....Right?  Idk, because this place was jammed packed on a Friday night...With my baby boy and Hubby in tow we hit this place up to see what all the rage was about.  After waiting about 15-20 minutes for a table, we were seated.  There were 2 managers working who were running around frantic the whole time.  We specifically asked for a table bigger than a 2 seater because we had our baby boy asleep in his newborn carrier.  So we were seated at a nice 4 seat table (two tables pushed together).  My baby boy was sitting on the booth side with me and my Hubby on the aisle/chair side of the table...The table provided a barrier so baby boy wouldn't go toppling to the floor should anything happen...Can you believe, right before our food comes out frantic manager guy approaches us and says...Would you mind if I take this table...I looked at him like he was kidding, but he wasn't...I said, yea I mind, It's providing a barrier so my son's seat doesn't fall out of the booth! He backed away with a smile...I'm sorry, but what an idiot...Anyhow, once our food came, it took up both tables! Outside of that, service was pretty slow...But I guess it's understandable given how busy they were.  When the food finally came it was good because we were starving by then. Masala sauce was very average, naan was tasty but had some charred spots.  Our appetizer was above average.  Some type of Street fries fried with chickpea batter.  They were good! My Hubby had the chicken biryani and he said it was decent.  All in all, our Indian craving was satisfied, but we're still on the hunt for a true 5 star."}
{"text":"We had eaten at this restaurant at its former location and loved the food. When they moved to this location a year or more ago we tried it and it was a very poor, buffet experience. Based on the yelp reviews we went again as we could not square the reviews with our experience. Well, the reviews are right on. A lovely experience and great food and service."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty good. The restaurant was clean and our waiter was really helpful. The food wasn't very spicy, it was actually kind of sweet. A lot of people are complaining that it's too sweet, you can just ask for some hot sauce on the side or something."}
{"text":"Just took some take-out lunch from here and can say with sincerity that I am now a fan of Marigold Maison.  I was the only person there which I hope is due to the fact that I came unknowingly just as they opened, because I really want this place to succeed.    Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan (my go-to at all Indian restaurants because I love it ok?) and while I didn't find them the best I've ever had I can say they were really good.  My one nit picky pseudo complaint is that the masala sauce was a little more liquidy than I'm used too, but that was a minor issue considering that the flavor was there.   It is a bit pricey but I knew that ahead of time and dont really blame the place because the portions are quite large (please dont change that!).  This is without question the best Indian food in this area.  I repeat in this area because there is of course better in the city, but I mean within a 5 mile radius.    I will return for my garlic naan and tikka cravings."}
{"text":"Great place for my first experience. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful. This items I chose were delicious and cooked perfectly. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"We finally have great Indian food in the neighborhood!! Had samosas, mutter paneer and chicken tikka (grilled and served on a hot skillet). All were excellent. Nice decor and bar seating too. Didn't expect that but pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this Marigold Maison! Our server was thorough and helpful, the cocktails (especially the Mumbai Mule) were great, and the food was exactly what we were looking for! We took our family there as first timers, and we all left saying this was a new find for dinner. Friends were watching our son, and we shared our experience. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant. Delicious, beautiful presentation (edible flowers!), good service, nice atmosphere. Handsome servers ;) I like their papadum and since some of my family has celiac they have gluten-free papadum too."}
{"text":"The wife and I routinely take out from this gem once a week. Garlic Naan and Chicken Tika Marsala are amazing."}
{"text":"This place is UNREAL! Highly recommended! I don't think you can go wrong here! Service is exceptional! One of the best places to eat in the valley!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Looking for health fair,  then this is a good way to go. Fragrant Indian spices add to the experience.  I don't do many (2) reviews, but feel compelled to put in a good word for people who strive to provide a good service."}
{"text":"BEST INDIAN FOOD IN PHOENIX!  The food deserves five stars as does the service! They have a great selection of gluten free and vegetarian options.  My personal favorite is the chicken tandoori with a side of yogurt sauce. If you're looking for the perfect way to end your meal; the mango Lassi is a delicious dessert to indulge in!  Why only 4 stars? You get what you pay for rings true. This place is very pricy, but If I could eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life, this would be it.   Sadly, spending $30 for just one persons meal is a jaw dropper. Thus, I have given this place 4 starts for being overpriced and having rice be an additional side order.   HOWEVER, they have reasonably priced and a creative lunch menu that makes up for the very expensive dinner menu.. If only they could add the chicken tandoori to the lunch menu, I would be there everyday."}
{"text":"We like to try new places and enjoy Indian food. After seeing Marigold Madison mentioned in a \"best\" NewTimes article decided to try it out last night. It's also close to home. We were greeted warmly by the host, we like to sit at the bar and were served well by bartender. Both were knowledgeable about the menu on which all of the items looked good. We tried the traditional chicken curry, some naan on the side. Everything was excellent. We'll be back often I'm sure. Take out and delivery as well."}
{"text":"I love this place a little too much! I crave it! So delicious! I love the chicken korma and the samosa! Everything really. Just writing about it makes me want to eat there. I will be eating my lunch there tomorrow! Literally, we fight over the left overs! So so so good!"}
{"text":"Such mismanaged place . If u have a lot of time to waste for ok food please come here"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is mellow and the food is spicy, just what we wanted in Indian cuisine. The staff are friendly and the chef makes the food to your level of heat... it's a winning combination. The lunch menu is smaller than the dinner and both offer fabulous options. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Indian joint around here. The food is consistently good. Not a lot of atmosphere but absolutely good food."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious!!  I am very happy I tried this place. Great service and decent portions, leftovers for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service, helpful with the menu, very attentive. We had the lunch chicken plate and lamb roll...both were awesome! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best quality indian food in AZ hands down! I highly recommend their chicken biriyani, out of all the different places I have tried this dish, this is the best I've ever had. If you're in the area, definitely stop by. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lunch with friends was great. The service was spectacular and food delicious. Servings are generous, so ask how big the plate will be if you aren't super hungry. The Mango Bellini is awesome, and the lamb roll is tasty, very much like a gyro."}
{"text":"I have ordered take now twice from Marigold. To be honest, as mentioned in previous reviews, the food is rather bland for Indian food. The portion size was decent, but the restaurant is nice, clean and modern, but when compared to other valley options, I found the dishes a little tame. There are other Indian restaurants in the valley nearby, and I would suggest trying different options to expand one's experiences."}
{"text":"This is literally the best Indian food I've ever had. Be sure to ask about the specials as they are always delicious. The Behl is a fresh and texturally wonderful appetizer. Anything in Masala is great too. Grab the lobster if it's available. There's a cheesy, creamy corn sauce that will bowl you over also on special the few times I've been."}
{"text":"I just got home from the most fantastic dinner tonight at Marigold Maison. Normally, I don't feel the need to write a review so fast, but I AM STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS AMAZING RESTAURANT   I found the Marigold on yelp, and my parents and I decided we would try it out tonight. Our waitress Gina was absolutely wonderful. She went into detail about the menu, telling us what was her favorites as well as the chef's and recommended different meat combinations.   Let me tell you, as a lover of Indian food, I have NEVER had better indian food in my life. The tandoori chicken came out perfectly moist where at most places it is dry. The Saag was so flavorful and had the perfect amount of spice. We also had the BIryani, which was so different and tasty. As an appetizer, order the seared eggplant it was OUTSTANDING!   However, besides the food, I was moved by just the general kindness of the staff at the Marigold. Gina was so kind, and was constantly checking on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. The chef came out while we were eating to see if we liked the food, and to tell us about his cooking. You can tell that he takes great pride in his work, and rightly so.  I will most definitely be returning when I am in the Scottsdale area!! Thank you Marigold for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"We dine often with 2 other couples that are vegetarian and my wife and I are omnivores so we are limited for really good places to eat that we can all enjoy the experience. The menu here is perfect for us and we have been several times and been very happy each time. Saturday night was even better as we tried some new things. All very good. This is now our favorite Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is down the street from our house but I've only eaten there once before. I enjoyed it my first time but haven't gone back because my fiance is not a fan of Indian food. With him gone Saturday night and a few glasses of wine in me, I decided to order takeout with UberEats.   My order: samosas, chicken tikka, garlic naan, rice. My total: $38.83 ($2.99 delivery included).   The samosas were my favorite part of my order. When I ordered them, I was afraid they might get soggy on the ride to my house but they were still crisp and so flavorful. If you can't handle a lot of spices, I would advise to to not get these. If you enjoy a lot of flavor, these are a great appetizer for you.   The garlic naan didn't really taste much like garlic. The garlic is visible but the taste was bland. It was just okay.   I was not impressed with the chicken tikka and it is probably because I don't like anything burnt. There were parts of the chicken that were pretty dark and overcooked so I threw out some of it. The dish was a safe one for me and I was not a fan. Where was the flavor?  Maybe it's because I'm Asian but I enjoy eating flavorful dishes with rice. I noticed that my entree wouldn't come with rice but I really didn't want to whip any up myself. The cost for a side of rice: $4. I would say that is a little much - especially for the portion. I guess I was paying for the convenience.  I was a bit disappointed but was able to enjoy some of it. I felt like it was a bit overpriced as well."}
{"text":"I had the chicken platter for lunch. What a great value. You get a good sampling plus Non plus dessert.  Simply the best Indian food I've had in AZ.  I left pretty full."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the valley, actually. The food and service are EXCELLENT! As a vegetarian there are so many options and if you come during the week, you MUST order the Vegetable Thali. A small sampling of all they have to offer. I'm no food writer, but I know good food when I eat it (Dal Makhani right now)."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Indian food or would like to try it, I highly recommend this delightful place.  The aroma immediately greets you as you enter.  The food is superb and the lunch platters are a great way to try a little of many items.  The dinner menu includes some of my favorite specialties.  I had never had shrimp madras before but tried it today and I was very pleased; the naan is perfect!  This place is very clean and the service is top!  All the things I expect from an exotic cafe.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was very flavorful. The chicken tikka was the best. Their signature drinks were great to try as well. I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"So good! This is our new favorite spot and that is saying a lot since we have to drive all the way from Gilbert. The restaurant is small but clean and comfortable. And it smells so good in there!   We have tried the chicken tiki, lamb vindaloo, samosas and garlic naan. Everything was perfect. The lamb was a little spicy but the tiki masala was great. The portions are generous and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be trying the curry next!    And try the mango lassi, sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had yet! Small, quaint restaurant but very friendly staff and delightfully delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Had heard some good things about Marigold Maison and decided to check it out on a Sunday evening.   We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers.   We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.  For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency.   Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none.   The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of sautéed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion.   The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus.   With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was \"we are really busy and need you to leave right now.\" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that.   I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill.   The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive."}
{"text":"Quality service and food. Bartender/ Manager was friendly and extremely welcoming.  Nice view at the bar. Sliding windows opening onto the beautiful AZ desert in October. The feeling is bliss mixed with Anne Hathaway on a boat the size of Titanic. A must go."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant and was very impressed with the delicious food,the waitress( Gina) was awesome , definitely recommend it and come back"}
{"text":"I've always picked up food from this location while working for Postmates and Uber Eats and loved the way the food smelled. Decided to go with the family finally and it was delicious! Our waiter, Abe, was phenomenal. He was on top of everything and we never had to ask for refills or anything else. He recommended several dishes and we tried them all which we enjoyed thoroughly! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the BEST Indian restaurant in The Valley. Their very talented chef Memo (formerly executive chef at Pepin Restaurant) will create incredible dishes to satisfy your paladar. I particularly love their shrimp tika, lamb masala and lamb chops or for a light lunch the shrimp mango salad..definitely a must if you live in The Valley or visiting.."}
{"text":"I agree with Jessica below. Although I can't speak to Indian food in India, I grew accustomed to excellent Indian food while living in England. Almost nothing over here compares. That is, except for Marigold Maison. This place is absolutely fantastic.  We ordered the samosas, masala dosa, garlic naan, chicken tandoori, lamb vindaloo, and gulab jamun. It was all flawless: explosive flavor, beautiful presentations, hearty servings. I ate long after I was full. Add to that craft beer and excellent service. I left feeling very, very happy. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!   My only complaint is that the quality of the ice cream was incongruent with how wonderful the gulab jamun was. There were ice crystals in mine, and the flavor itself was a little bland. I'd look into a higher quality ice cream or gelato."}
{"text":"We met some new friends recently when we stayed at an AirBnB and they highly recommended this place for Indian food.  We arrived on a Saturday night at 6pm and was seated right away as a party of 4.  Ordered garlic naan which arrived hot and was very tasty.  We also had Samosas for appetizers and they were cooked perfectly.  My husband had the lamb chops and I had the tandoori chicken --- both were excellent and the accompanying rice was a generous portion.  We wanted to have dessert but were full from the generous portions of our dinners.  We will be back when we visit PHOENIX again!"}
{"text":"Disappointing...both my husband's vindaloo (ordered spicey) and my aloo gobi were insipid.  The chai was not hot and not very tasty. The naan was dry. It was noisey and not the place to dine if you want to enjoy dinner conversation. They automatically added 20% tip to tab. Service was fair .. The pappadam were good.  No kheer on the menu.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Well, I'm a bit confused. And I got the feeling they were too. The article I read in the New Times said they were like the \"Chipotle\" of Indian cuisine. When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly server who apologetically explained that for now, they were going with a \"sit-down\" concept until they work some things out.   The menu seemed quite small, but that could be a good thing right? That means they should be expertly crafted dishes.   I asked for their choice of beverages. That got confusing because I didn't want the alcohol choices, just beverages other than water. I was told the list of soda options but I asked for \"other\" nonalcoholic beverages. Finally a connection was made. I chose a lime and ginger juice drink. When I received it, there was no detectable ginger in it. The server assured me that it contained ginger because he knew they had ginger in the kitchen. Then he came back to inform me that he tasted it and I was correct. There was no ginger. Then he said the manager tasted it and said, \"oh, there's supposed to be ginger in there?\"   So, the food was ok. The chicken masala was my favorite. The chana dal was a little bland, and the saag chicken was ok. The bread was too oily. The rice was dry. And the rice pudding was kind of weird, but I liked the hint of rose water. I would have liked a creamier texture with rice that didn't seem like it was chopped up in the food processor first. And I don't know if a side of rice and a rice dessert was such a good idea.   It was an awkward time of day to go there-right between when they close for two hours before dinner service. We were kind of locked in, followed by an apology from the manager that he was not locking us in, but rather locking others out.   The non-ginger drinks were taken off our bill so for the price of our lunch $25, it was ok. I don't think I'd return for lunch, but I'd be willing to see what they can do for the dinner menu. But wait-I'm still wishing they had implemented the Chipotle-style set-up which is what brought me here in the first place."}
{"text":"We got three Vegetarian Thali's and one Chicken. The presentation was very good. The food is flavorful. For our palates we need some spice so we requested some chopped green chilies which they accommodated for our table. We may be back if we're in town again. Naan was very good."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable evening here with friends. The food was delicious and we had no trouble finding vegetarian choices. The restaurant was very busy and the service was okay. The atmosphere is nice and it was easy to have conversations. We plan to go back soon."}
{"text":"Great food, and service. Atmosphere is fun, though small. It has some outdoor seating that will be great in the winter."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian selection. This place asked if me and my friend had a reservation... It gets pretty packed. It's a swanky restaurant with amazing food!"}
{"text":"I hesitated in writing a review because this place is soooo good and I did want my little secret spot to get out but it has. You just  can't keep food this good and service this friendly secret for too long.   Only negative is if you are going for dinner you probably should call ahead for a table."}
{"text":"Completely worth the drive from the East Valley!  One of our good friends recommended this place, so my wife and I had to try it. We consider ourselves Indian food snobs... Let's start by saying the service was fast and friendly. We had an awesome waitress named Pushpa who took great care of us.  I had the mango lassie and chicken tikka masala. The lassie was soooo smooth and delicious I could seriously go back just for it.  The chicken tikka was amazing too. I ordered it \"Indian Spicy\" and all though that wasn't really quite spicy enough for me, it still tasted delicious. Pushpa brought out some additional chili past to allow me to heat things up even more!!!  Oh! I almost forgot, we had the samosa's for an appetizer... WOW! so delicious.  My wife had chicken saag, she thought it tasted great as well.  Overall, I'd make the 30+ miles drive again just to come to this restaurant..."}
{"text":"I'm not an Indian food expert but I love it, and marigold has the best Indian dish ive ever had (mutter paneer).   That being said, everything I've ever had from here is incredible.  When I have company that is not particularly cultured, this is a great place/food to impress them with and to open them up to new foods in a non threatening manner.   Seriously, incredible food."}
{"text":"This has been my 3rd visit to this place since they opened... honestly, the very 1st time, we as a group went, we enjoyed the lamb chops n biryani was horrible,loved their keema dip. On the 2nd visit we were informed no lamb keema dip but chicken dip, which was o.k and again the food was alright. Today we decided to try their lunch thali. I ordered for the lamb thali- the dishes were salty. They had run out of lentil soup so replaced it with dal makhani and my husband n friend ordered the chicken thali and they had run out of chicken too, so we had to wait for 15mins till they could whip up something. Well the chicken Masala tasted more like watery tomato gravy sweet and the chicken saag was o.k... we had placed a Togo order of chicken bowl which the server forgot to place, so we waited additional 10 mins... they were kind enough to not charge for 1 thali,due to the delay.. that shows good customer service but overall, I'm gonna say the food is 3.5. Some dishes can be a hit but most are a miss"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing! Portions we're good and the prices were not to bad! I will be coming back for sure:."}
{"text":"We love it here!!  If you're not up for the drive to Tempe for Curry Corner - this is absolutely the place to go!!  I honestly don't know that we will make the drive now that we have discovered this hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Second time here and it's even better.  Love the spicy!   Tony. Our waiter is very helpful and polite. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"The space is extremely small. We walked in and were told they take reservations, but they were able to seat us.   They have authentic Punjabi cuisine. They are pricey but tasty. Their bread (naan) is really big and good! The service was slow but they were very busy, our waitress was nice. I did order hot tea and the mug had dirt on the rim which grossed me out a little.   Overall I like this place, but have to admit it's a little pricy."}
{"text":"Tastes good - it has more of a rich ambience.  All their portions were big enough; and hence they are pricy to match that Tip - For 3 members - two items can be ordered/shared ; otherwise each of them will need to request for a to-go box :)"}
{"text":"The food and service are both good, but the space is very confined, the tables are tiny even for two with no appetizers and only two glasses (I think they just kept the fast food tables from the failed Bombay Spice Chipotle-like concept), and it was very, very warm in the restaurant (an open kitchen requires better better ventilation I suspect).  It makes it hard to enjoy your food in such an unwelcoming and unconfortable space.  Perhaps takeout is the only option for me with this restaurant.  It's a shame,  the original Bombay Spice on Tatum and Shea was such a nice spot."}
{"text":"Great Indian Food and curries, just a little too pricey so may only visit once a year."}
{"text":"I am appalled by the service I received here. I ordered a take out tandoori chicks and chaat to go on a weekend night. When I arrived at home, I realized that the chicken was not at all seasoned and had no tandoori flavor (I'm  quite familiar with Indian food). I was thoroughly disappointed when I called and they requested evidence. I sent a picture but they're quested addition corroboration in order to approve a refund. Worst Indian place in town."}
{"text":"This is a bright and cheerful, clean Indian restaurant. Service is fast. Unfortunately, and as a person who really knows Indian cooking, the sauces are watery to being quite bland. The spices lack flavor, which is an odd reaction to Indian cooking. I tried two lamb dishes and both were very bland. The lentils were well made and the basmati rice fine, but overall they need to figure out a number of new recipes. I don't think we will be coming back. I am being generous with three stars but gave points for a pleasant environment and wait staff."}
{"text":"Today I went to this restaurant with my best friend .we ordered dosa ,garlic naan, dal tadka, food was so good and taste.staff also so good and smiley .we will recommend this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, the chicken Tikka is delicious and comes with plenty of tasty rice, so no need to order more, unless you want to share!  If you like spicy, make sure to order extra spicy as their seasoning is mellow, but so tender and tasty.   Get the garlic Naan, but plan on getting twice as much as you would normally order. The garlic is amazingly fresh, so you will thank me :)   Also, don't order through Yelp as they report an hour wait for everything, when popular items like Chicken Tikka are probably ready for you in 20 minutes.   The best way to share their Tikka or Tandoori is to get a nice bowl, put the rice in and pass around the entrees. Special tip, there's a Dickeys BBQ right next door with a Coca Cola Freestyle Machine, so you can get some great pop to quench your thirst.   Sometimes, I even get Dickeys Chicken and add it to the Masons Tikka... Amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place  (was Bombay Spice) has pivoted twice (and moved once) from an Indian Fusion concept to an Indian Chipotle concept to just a darned good Indian restaurant.  That's the history, but all that matters is the present.  Really great food.  Good service.  Real Tandoor oven.    Start with samosas, then get the lamb vindaloo and an order of naan.  You'll be a happy camper (and you'll have enough to take home for lunch tomorrow - but get another order of naan to take home!)  There's a really good 'sampler' on the lunch menu, give that a go sometime, too!"}
{"text":"Very good food!! Love that they have takeout option too!! Tiki masala very good. Love the naan too"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch with wife .. I always love the thali here, but in chicken thali today the daal wasnt well prepared.. Took chicken biriyani and was dissapointed wth it as it was not at all close to authentic hyderbad chicken biriyani.. But still i willl say tey serve the best thali in phoenix"}
{"text":"Was driving back home from North Phoenix and thanks to Yelp found this little spot near PV mall.  Did my usual takeout, order a glass of wine, read a few chapters of my current novel.  Wish they had a bar area to sit at and read my book, but they accommodated me perfectly at a 2-top.  I nearly always order eggplant Bartha, garlic naan and raita.  Their's was excellent.  And a nice bonus, they include four of their condiments (tamarind sauce, cilantro/mint/chile, their own hot sauce and raita) with the order. If I'm in the area I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent.. maybe 5 stars but I haven't had enough Indian food to make a more educated rating.. I'll be back though that's for sure"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was a little slow for happy hour.  The chicken tikka was a little too salty for my taste, but otherwise very juicy and spicy.  The staff is very friendly and helpful, and I enjoyed my meal here.  Happy hour deals are great- we had the samosa, garlic naan, and chicken tikka for about $10.  I would love to try the tikka masala and curry next time i'm here."}
{"text":"First time eating Indian food, delicious food. There were 6 of us and we all enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Well we ordered a hell lot of things here. Samosa chat, pani puri, chicken tikka-great, Matar paneer- great, lamb and chicken were okay too. Best part is to taste all the deserts which I think were the best."}
{"text":"Overprised tastless food. Chicken cury was very poor - boiled checken breat peaces thrown into a bowl of tomato paste based sause."}
{"text":"We came here with high hopes of finding our \"go to\" Indian place.  Definitely a nice atmosphere, friendly staff and decent food, but they couldn't seem to get the timing and details of our order right.  We ordered an appetizer, but it came out after our entrees - we ended up sending it back.  It took us over 5 minutes to get silverware even though our entrees had been served...they were getting cold since we had to wait so long to get silverware to start eating.  I am hopeful that our experience was the exception instead of the rule."}
{"text":"Rikan was AWESOME - great service! Delicious food! Clean restaurant.  Kid friendly. My kids got the kid menu items & after tasting our meals wanted to come again so they could have mom & dad's food. Definitely coming back & bringing friend!"}
{"text":"Horrible food taste and poor staff . I had a worse experience eating dinner with my friends and family."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food I've ever had in Phoenix.  I can't speak to the whole menu, because in fairness, I always order the same thing... because it's THAT good, (chicken tikka masala w/naan.)  The staff is very friendly, food comes out quick, and it's clean.  Portions are big, I always take home left overs.  It's a little pricey depending on how much you order, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Always enjoyable food here. First time back since their renovation. Great to see their expanded space as their previous space was too small. Tried their chicken tiki and chicken curry lunch platter which was delicious! Highly recommended this place. Food is always wonderful."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Phoenix! Consistently good food. Lamb Vindaloo, lamb masala and lamb curry are delicious."}
{"text":"By far Arizona's BEST Indian restaurant! Not only is the food delicious, but the intimate feeling, and amazing staff make your dining experience a step above the rest! My friend was a first timer to Indian cuisine, and Abraham (our server) not only walked him through the menu, but really took the time to get to know us. He was awesome! As I craved Marigold Maison for weeks since my last visit, I can't wait to fulfill the inevitable craving again in a couple of more weeks!"}
{"text":"We just had a GREAT dinner and we're so glad we tried it!  We had garlic and onion naan which was delicious.  Entrees were Tikka Masala, the Dal Makhani and Lamb Curry. OMG was it good!  The lentil dish was outstanding.  I'm vegetarian, but the meat eaters commented on how good the different meats were. The place is warm and inviting and the service really made me happy. They have a nice wine list too. Gina was our waitress and she was very helpful, sweet and professional all rolled up with a great attitude!  Steve the manager stopped by and was very nice and personable.  The staff are very helpful if you are not that familiar with Indian food. Great job Marigold Maison.  I'll see you often."}
{"text":"I'm not going to be too critical here because when it comes to Indian food, I am a one trick pony.  I get Chicken Tikka Masala every single time.  Every time.  LOL  I like it so spicy it makes me sweat.  I'm still trying to figure out how to convey that to a restaurant when I order.  I got take out here, and it was really good.  Ordered a couple different types of naan and both were delicious.  The rice was not exceptional, but again... good.  So, my review is for chicken tikka masala eaters.  Nothing wrong with this dish here, but any suggestions on where I can get my favorite indian dish prepared so spicy it hurts twice are welcomed."}
{"text":"My husband And I had a reservation at this restaurant tonight. We sat down and after 30 minutes not a single waiter even came by our table. We received menus and the lady walked away. After a while several other waiters walked by and not one said anything or offer to get our server or ask if we even needed a glass of water. This is the first time I have ever gotten up and left a restaurant. On my way out again not one word to us. However the manager did manage to a slam the door in my face. Wow, I don't think I have ever had service so terrible. Oh right, I mean NO service. Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food. We ordered chicken tikka, lamb chops and lamb hyderabad biryani and each dish is delicious in its own way. The flavors are robust. The salad that is served along with chicken and lamb is amazing. Biryani is topped with marigold flower petals to symbolize the name of the restaurant.  Our waitress Gina is so hospitable and well ahead informed abt the time it takes for lamb chops. Last but not the least the desert - rice kheeer served as a complimentary with a topping of cinnamon powder is excellent. We are overwhelmed with the ambience and the delicious food.  Not far off perfection for our date night."}
{"text":"Seriously so so good. Everything we had was delicious and FRESH! We will definitely be back. Service, food and atmosphere was all too notch."}
{"text":"Cravings.....good old cravings.   My darling and I hopped on Yelp to find some Indian food and we stumbled across Marigold Maison in Paradise Valley. Jumped in our car and headed their way.  Restaurant is very clean, first thing my husband and I noticed. We were seated right away, not a lot of people were in the restaurant when we got there but by the time our meal was sent to our table every single table was occupied. It got BUSY and I know why, their food is AMAZING!  I ordered the chicken Tikka Marsala and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Chicken was so tender, basmati rice was cooked to perfection. We also ordered 2 orders of garlic naan, be-careful, they are ADDICTING!  My husband ordered the lamb chops and it was soooo tender an cooked perfectly. Like butter in your mouth, it just melted.  We will be back! Customer service was amazing, food was UNREAL and it was a perfect dinner out.  **Management** The only thing I noticed, despite a clean restaurant which is a plus in my book - have whoever cleans the tables check the chairs, there were crumbs left on both my husband and I's chair. No one wants to have to wipe down a chair before they eat at any restaurant. Also, one of your chairs is off balance, so I had to change seats. The table also was wobbly but our server took care of that for us right away."}
{"text":"What a disappointing lunch and it was due to the service.  I think this happens a lot when one goes for late lunch, which we did, at 12:30 pm.  The server brought our meals and promised to bring sauce that goes with one of them but she never brought it.  We had a hard time getting her attention.  She had two tables of six, one table of four and our table of two.  She was obviously busy but we wished we had gotten the promised sauce.  At the end of the meal, I gave her $50 and a man (the host?  the manager?) brought my bill back with zero change.  I approached the server at her register and she brought the change.  But . . . it was short.  I asked her about it and she said we would talk to the man at the front (the host?  the manager?).  I asked him about it and he immediately backed away from the situation by saying, \"I just gave $50 to server.\"  (\"I'm just a bystander - not my job - don't ask me\" is what it sounded like to me.).   I finally got the right change.  Really, who needs all this hassle when you just stopped by for a simple late lunch?"}
{"text":"In the middle is all I got for Marigold Maison. I had major high hopes when choosing a restaurant last week after a busy week of travel. We arrived about 820pm on a Friday night and were promptly sat. I noticed right off that the waitress didn't allow us any time to look at the drink menu before asking us what we would like; she tried to get our order as soon as she sat us while we had the menus in our faces. It always takes me a minute to peruse a menu and I truly don't like someone hovering while I do it. Add tired and the first opp for me and my husband to relax and enjoy a moment out together and that becomes a bit worse. Since she returned to hover in about a minute, I just ordered a white wine. She wanted to take our meal order then, to which we both chuckled, that was gonna be a few minutes , ( hint to back off for seven!).  We considered doing the Tour of India at 24pp , as it seemed a way to sample all things .. BUT also maybe way too much food! We started with the Lentil Crepe and Paneer Pakora. Both were tasty! We also wanted two Naan breads: Garlic and Mirchi... we could have done one! They are hand stretches and big! The Mirchi was spicy with actual sprinklings of chile on top. The garlic was divine! For dinner we did a Classic Curry with chicken and Malai Kofta , a vegetarian dish made of dumplings in a creamy sauce of saffron , almond and cashew. We loved each dish but the service was rushed and that was not okay. It was a Friday night and we didn't arrive late. The bill was brought to us while we were in the middle of enjoying our mains and no offer of another wine was made. We continued to ask for water. No offer of dessert and it left us feeling as though we made a mistake coming up to PV to try Marigold Maison out. The patio was still full of diners and I was confused by the rush. We paid; we left and decided to go else where to finish our Friday night date :)"}
{"text":"Nice simple interior, clean and friendly staff. I was recommended by a friend who is American  but has spent considerable time in India and...... drum roll.... omg this is my new favorite Indian restaurant in Arizona! Actually it's my new favoriteIndian restaurant period, I lived in California for 40 years and this gem  now takes top spot! My husband and I both chose platters for lunch and I had shrimp and he chicken. Everything in plate was good but The Marsala was DIVINE, we both agreed. I will definitely be a repeat customer wanting to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"MY FAV INDIAN in AZ!!!! Can't say enough about this place..... it is just spot on... The servers & chefs are SUPER attentive & helpful as well.... I'm in love with so many of their dishes I could eat there EVERY DAY .... Seared Tofu / Samosa Chaat / Idly / Masala Dosa / Chickpea Ceviche / Lentil Soup / Channa / Aloo Gobi / Goan Curry / Paneer anything / Tikka etc etc ... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! They are also expanding into the spot next door and creating a bar area ...."}
{"text":"Loved the food. The Bel was fantastic and the chicken tikka masala had a great mix of spices. Definitely try the mango Bellini!"}
{"text":"If you want great Indian food then this is the place for you!  This is by far the BEST Indian food in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  It was so much fun to try different dishes and have everyone taste GREAT.  Yes, everyone was delicious.  I couldn't pick a favorite because they were are ALL fantastic.   When we left the restaurant we were already planning our next trip back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner tonight.  Delicious food including chicken curry and lamb vindaloo.  Spice level was medium plus.  The service was so attentive and sincere.  Abraham and Gina were great.  We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"So nice to see the old (Tatum & Shea) Bombay spice concept back. Granted I did not give the Cactus Rd. buffet a shot thanks to Yelp Reviews, I did want to see what Marigold Maison was about. Great ambiance and open kitchen, Sunil the head chef is always welcoming. Andy was a great host that kept our kids thoroughly entertained the entire evening. My kids now say let's go eat at \"Andy's Place\", not a name change suggestion just pointing out the impression he made. And as parents know entertaining the kids while out to eat can be a challenge. Lentil cakes and my standard chicken tikka masala were our choice that evening and they were as good as ever. I would recommend trying it out and will go again to see if they can edge up to 5 stars like the Bombay Spice of yore...  A side note, as I was leaving the restaurant, a couple mentioned to Andy how their \"dinner was good but they miss the buffet\". Andy pointed out that reviews for the buffet were not favorable on Yelp, at which point the couple proceeded to say Yelp reviews are a fraud, bla bla bla...I couldn't bare listening to it and felt like I needed to stand up for Yelp as someone that really finds value from it. It's no fraud! You can quickly figure out which reviews are \"fraudulent\" and which are not, so I'm glad to see Bombay/Marigold Maison is in touch with reality and Yelp's value add to restaurant owners. Ok off my soapbox. Go to Marigold Maison and tell them a Yelper sent you!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place. First time we went the chef was trying out dishes and we had a few plates come out for us to test. They were all great. We also had a seafood special that was to die for.   We've been back many times and it hasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my brother out for his birthday for some Indian food. This was our first time to this place. Our waitress Pulpa was phenomenal. She was very attentive, funny and personable. She truly made our dinner spectacular. The food was delicious also. And they have happy hour and a decent wine list for an Indian place. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I went with a large group, and I had an opportunity to try about 5 different dishes along with several different appetizers.  Let's start with the positive - the tandoori salmon was heavenly.  The naan was hot, crispy, and flavorful. Everything else was truly disappointing.  The dishes either totally lack flavor, or they were just all heat and no substance.  My review is on the flavor of the food, not the heat level.  For me, the heat level on most of the dishes was inadequate.   For the dishes where the heat levels were adequate, they substituted heat for flavor.   I have eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants; I usually eat Indian food about 8 to 12 times a year.  I absolutely love Indian cuisine in general, but not here.  The servers were attentive and very pleasant; I have no problem with the wait staff.  The ambience is very nice too.  This review is on the food alone.  When I look at the other reviews, my guess is that the patrons who frequent this restaurant have not been to many other Indian food destinations.  I can think of about three locations within 15 minutes of this restaurant where the food quality is another league.  I could give you a list of about a dozen other Indian restaurants in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area that blow this place out of the water.  With so much awesome Indian food in the valley, I would say that you could skip this restaurant, and you wouldn't be missing anything.  I actually don't give many bad reviews, and I would give it 2 1/2 stars if possible.  I figured I would round up to 3, just to be nice.  Everything about the restaurant is perfectly fine, except the food is average at best.  The portions were substantial and the prices were reasonable; the food was just completely unimpressive.  I won't be back, but I actually can't wait to return to one of my old standbys because I didn't realize how good they were until I had a chance to compare them to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I learned about this place when they offered a \"lunch only\" Groupon.  When I looked them up I realized they were located at the same address Bombay Spice had recently relocated to in 2014, which means Bombay didn't even last a year.  I went there for lunch yesterday.  Both the waiter and General Manager were very nice and answered several questions.    I learned that Marigold is owned by the same corporation (JNK Concepts) that owned Bombay.  They have the same chef, but completely different food, menu and pricing.  JNK has multiple restaurants primarily in Phoenix and Chicago.  They also own Roka Akor and Nobuo here in the Phoenix area and still have one Bombay Spice in downtown Chicago.  The restaurant has been upgraded slightly.  You no longer order your food at the counter; they have wait staff.  The prices are considerably higher.  I told both the waiter and GM that I'd not been there before and wanted to be impressed, so asked them what they would suggest, indicating that I was thinking of ordering one of their Thali dishes.  They recommended that I try one of two other dishes which weren't on the lunch menu, but their dinner menu.  I seldom order Dosa because they are usually vegetarian, which I'm not, but I decided to give it a try.  In addition, I specifically wanted to taste their Naan.  There Dosa is called \"Masala Dosa\" which is a crepe filled with potato and onion.  It is served with two sides; Coconut Chutney (the larger bowl) and Sambar.  The crepe looked massive on the plate when it was served, however half of it was filled - the rest was just empty crepe.  The Coconut Chutney was very good, but I wished it had been spicier and there had been more of it.  The filling was OK, but not terrific, however you have to keep in mind, I'm not a vegetarian.  There was very little spice, and in my opinion, taste, in the filling.  There Naan bread was very good, but not the best I've had at some nearby Indian restaurants.  Their service was excellent and the GM was very helpful.  I left with mixed emotions.  The food was good, but I was not as blown away as others appear to be.  I'm sure they use good ingredients and it was well prepared, but to me lacked the kick and taste I would have preferred.  The killer was their prices; considerably higher than most Indian restaurants.    This Dosa and Naan came to $14.  I'm not a big eater, but the Dosa without the Naan would not have filled me.  Without a coupon I wouldn't go back and pay $14 for what I had.  It probably isn't fair to compare their prices with other places because they claim their meat and fish are a far better quality, and I haven't tried them, but I frequently get either a meat or seafood masala/curry, and Marigold's prices are 25-70% more.  Without additional coupons it is unlikely I'd return, based on price alone.  Their food to me wasn't \"that\" special.  I'm giving them a 3-star overall, but believe their food probably deserves a 4-star, although not for me based on what I had."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how this restaurant has received such high reviews.  I've been to many Indian restaurants in the US & in the world (including in India) and this is the most overrated place I have been to.  The food was very average.  Seems like a place people go to for the atmosphere.  I really don't understand the high ratings here.  I recommend Nandini and Little India in Tempe."}
{"text":"We've visited twice. First time around tried the Biryani Hyderabadi and Special roasted Salmon. Biryani was a lot spicier than i expected, but the cardamom/cumin crusted Salmon was delicious .   Second time was even better. Lamb curry and Chicken tikka (tandoor) were both excellent - the meat was cooked exactly right and the spices were flavorful, but not overpowering at all. Service was great both times."}
{"text":"It was pretty busy for a late lunch on a Monday. I absolutely loved the food - when I heard same ownership as Roka, I knew we had to check it out, as Roka was always a favorite of mine when I lived I'm AZ. Don't expect anything like Roka though! This is a totally different concept, in the side of a strip mall, and much more casual.  I went with my bf and his family, we tried just about everything we could from a couple of the street food options to the lunch platter with chicken tikka and another chicken with a spinach curry (thali's?).  The chickpea dip with potatoes was super good and unique, the sauteed rice with vegetables and curry was fantastic as was the garlic naan.  I loved the quinoa salad on the lunch platter, it was a lot of food and fun to share between four of us. The chickpea flour battered chicken was a good option for very picky kids - although we loved the spicier options!   Our server was good about describing the preparations and we asked him to ask the chef to order for us (a good way to get to try the best items I think). We ended up with four dishes that I had never had before and I loved them all!  If I were local, I would def make it a fun lunch or date night spot."}
{"text":"Good food, decently fast service.  Big selection, the lunch specials are well worth it and you get a great selection."}
{"text":"I was really hankering for some Indian food. The reviews of this place were great, the people on the phone were awesome and the service was super. We got our food for our takeout order. It smelled great and the first few bites were incredible. The samosa was delicious. But the rest of the food was so salty I could barely taste anything else. They even salted the salad. The salad! Seriously? What's the point of that? I wanted so badly to love this place. I wanted to this to be our go to Indian place. Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen. Why is it that restaurants have to over salt their food like that? After spending over $50 for dinner I was exceptionally disappointed and had to throw out over half the food."}
{"text":"After living in England, I grew accustomed to really good Indian food. I've been searching for a proper curry in the Phoenix area for the last few years. This is the first place that's hit the spot.   We came in for dinner and ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chicken korma. The chicken tikka masala had a bit more of a tomato base than I am used to but it was delicious. The korma had a little kick to it but I wouldn't really register it as spice. Overall, the flavor of everything was amazing. We also had a garlic naan and papadums. Everything tasted wonderful and the service was good. We will definitely be bringing all of our family and friends here."}
{"text":"Got take out chicken tikka masala, sagg paneer, lamb vindaloo, lamb biriani, and garlic nann.  I've tried a lot of Indian food throughout the valley and this was the best I've had.  The flavors were very clean, and judging from what I saw and smelled when I walked in, the chefs that cooked this meal really know their stuff!  This is with out a doubt my new go to Indian restaurant in town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in town! My favorite dish is the Lamb Vindaloo, so spicy but with heaps of great flavor!   For lunch, the platters are a great value. My favorite is the Lamb Thali, and it comes with lamb vindaloo, lamb curry, dal, naan, and kala jamun. Absolutely perfect, and a great value!   Service is absolutely friendly and welcoming. Very helpful folks who talk pride in this restaurant. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Love their chicken tikka masala and their shrimp appetizer! They have some really good options for gluten free people as well as vegetarian. Service is fast and friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town, fresh with perfect sauces and high quality meats, veggies and ingredients. Wonderful staff. Great renovation for more people (no more waiting in line!). P.S. The Lamb Saag is amazing and lunch platters are the best lunch. Also try the Bhel ...light and addictive. :-)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location many times.. Unfortunately, the past few times were getting worse and worse. This past experience has to be the worst tasting meal I've ever had over there. I only eat vegetarian dishes. This was the first time I ever eaten any Indian dish that turned out being sweet instead of being spicy. It had grapes it in for some reason and was very distracting and turned me off from the meal completely. Unfortunately, I ordered take out. So the entire meal which took over an hour to drive there and back turned into trash in a matter of minutes. My wife and I were very disappointed and had to warn the Yelp community. I hope I'm the last to have such a terrible experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Indian food at Marigold Maison... We tend to get the Chicken Tikka Masala or Lamb Biryani for the entree.  Both are excellent options.  The quality of the ingredients is the main selling point for me.  We've sampled nearly half the appetizers and they are all filled with unique flavors and great spices.  The staff is always friendly and now that they've renovated, the atmosphere is superb as well!"}
{"text":"The food tasted very very very bad me and my wife did not enjoy the food whatsoever we felt like the server kept looking at my wife it was very unappropriate I would give this restaurant one star but I guess I'm not that bad of a person"}
{"text":"Service last night was lackluster. Sat for 8 minutes before anyone greeted us after being sat.  Food was very good but had to ask 3 people for more water. We were very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"DH & I have eaten at Marigold several times before and we normally order the same thing matter paneer and butter chicken. This time we ordered our usual and the butter chicken was yellow, whereas in the past it has been orange. The flavors were not the same as it has been in past, the chicken was also over cooked and very dry. We will not be eating at Marigold again."}
{"text":"By far, the BEST Indian food in town!  I could eat her every day!  One word, \"AUTHENTIC!\"  Homemade spices and sauces and truly amazing.  No salt or any other additives needed!  The only problem is that when you try one dish, you want to order more, more and more!  Truly a phenomenal place that seriously makes your taste buds explode!  A must to be hooked!  Healthy and majority gluten free!  I would drive a long distance just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Four of us enjoyed multiple dishes. Each one was delicious and the service was excellent. Our server Pushpa and Abraham were welcoming, knowledgeable and professional. Marigold Maison is a neighborhood treasure. Thanks. We will return soon."}
{"text":"Do not go without a reservation We had enjoyed good food at this restaurant so today we reached at 5 30 at the restaurant and the restaurant was very empty so they had like 5 tables empty and 2 occupied we asked for a seat and they told us that all the tables are reserved and although we had a baby they suggested us a seat outside which was cramped even for 2 persons . On top of it they said they we would give u a seat but u may eat very slow and then the reservation people would have to wait . I would have understood the situation if all the tables are full but there is only 1 couple having food inside and they let us go I had some good food in past but this situation has really got me thinking"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and really enjoyed it. We ordered classic curry and kashmiri korma. Both were very yummy. My favorite though is the naan. Homemade -light&airy. Very good. Apparently they just remodeled and it's very nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian Food I have had in Arizona.   There were 3 in our party and we had the Tandoori Shrimp, Tandoori Chicken. Butter Chicken, and Marigold Biryani with Lamb. The server recommended Kashmiri Naan which was excellent. We also had regular Naan. All the Naan was fresh out of the Tandoori.  The Butter chicken was REALLY good.   I ordered the Marigold Biryani with Lamb medium heat but it came what I would call mild.  The Tandoori here is different from other restaurants it is not colored red and not as much sauce but still good, it comes on a bed of onions and bell peppers \"Fajita\" style.  This place is pricey though.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent I have had a chicken and vegetable curry for lunch and today we had that tikka  chicken. I would love to give it five stars but I don't know maybe I am ordering The wrong thing the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because the prices are simply outrageous for what you get. When I get something to go Albeit I'm from Southern California where Indian restaurants abound but that usually includes rice and naan that is not the case here and that is so annoying! I spent $20 for one person today for lunch. Very classy inside the staff is very friendly I love that even the chef interacts with you but they've just got to do something about their pricing maybe reduce the portion sizes I don't know...okay update the owner himself sent me a message and said they would take a look at this & review now that's what I call customer service!"}
{"text":"Safe Indian brought to you by white hipsters.  The Thali dishes are good.  Solid but I prefer the cheaper prices, greater variety, and better portions at places like Indian Paradise or Indian Dehli Palace."}
{"text":"I love going to Marigold Maison! Every time I eat here I am left feeling satisfied and full. Staff is always wonderful and attentive, making sure I am happy. I am always suggesting this place to friends looking to try authentic and delicious Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"We really love the take out from here and have ordered it several times. Always tastes great, and delivered on time. Would certainly recommend them."}
{"text":"I have been to Marigold Maison several times and I always order the vegetable tikka misala prepared vegan.  It was one of my favorite dishes in the entire valley.   A group of us went for dinner on 3/4/2017.  I placed my order for vegetable tikka masala and asked that it be made vegan.  Shortly after the waiter took our order he returned and said that the vegetable tikka masala can't be made vegan.  Another person from the restaurant came to our table and said that they no longer make it vegan because they had to purchase coconut milk in a large size and they had too much waste in their restaurant if not enough people requested vegan which would mean substituting coconut milk for cream.   Their menu clearly states that any vegetarian item can be made vegan.  It seems logical that they would stand behind their menu and carry the items needed to veganize dishes.  Coconut milk comes in lots of sizes including cans which have a long shelf life.   They have lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"We come here a lot! Food is always good & fresh. My favorite is the chicken tikka masala or for lunch the thali platter.  We love the friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have a bunch of Indian clients. They taught me all about Indian food. I've tried all the Indian restaurants in the valley. This is the best. Not cheap, just the best. Really outstanding food and great service"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great food, excellent service. They even gave us a mango smoothie on the house for our sleeping princess! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Lentil soup, eggplant veggie entree and Lamb Vindaloo was great! Spicy & loves it. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable....more so than me and I'm suppose to be Indian! Great location, outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"I'm going to be kind here and give three stars because a few of the dishes were good.  Specifically, the mango salad, the samosa, the tika masala were good to very good.    The \"vindaloo\" was just WRONG.  I have eaten indian food all my adult life, both here and in India.  I have be fortunate to count many Indian nationals among my friends and dined with them.  I know what indian food is.  The \"vindaloo\" here is NOT vindaloo, and whatever it is, it is not tasty.  The Biryani was even spicier than the \"vindaloo\" and, other than the extremely hot spices, rather tasteless.  Finally, the \"curry\" was unrecognizable.  Much like the \"vindaloo.\" I am not sure what the \"curry\" was, but it was unlike any curryI have ever eaten and not tasty.    I would give this restaurant a lower rating, but the three items I mentioned at the beginning of the review were ok and others in my party enjoyed them.  If I was basing this review only on the food that I ordered, I would give it one or two stars.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Met with a friend here for dinner and Jeff (or Jeffrey) was our server. Eveything was good, the only kind of funny thing is that the host that seated us seemed a little in disbelief that I had made reservations for lunch. Hey, in my defense: I do not come here often, I do not know how busy they get... and I get OpenTable points when I make and show up for a reservation : )  I am not an expert on Indian food, I mostly get the tikka masala everywhere I go, and now thanks to a friendly but heavily perfumed lady at Tandoory Times, I know that chicken tikka does not have sauce, and the one I meant to order is chicken tikka masala.  I was a little adventurous for this time and ended up ordering one of the Thali lunch options, which is the round platter or tray with a few different dishes in small stainless steel containers. Honestly all of it was really good. I got 2 meats, rice, rice pudding, some sort of salad, plus garlic bread. I think I little soup too.  Overall I was very pleased with the food and the service. Only the tea had some sort of flavoring that I was not too crazy about. I was expecting plain tea."}
{"text":"We tried weekday lunch here with Thaali and starters which are not all spicy(like typical Indian food) ,The best part here is ambience ,service and nice desserts.  this is not the right place if you are looking for spicy Indian food ,otherwise it's decently good"}
{"text":"I ordered the onion naan and lamb tikka marsala for take out.  The onion naan tasted like omelette in a bread.  It tasted soft and squishy.  It was so so.  I threw it away after trying to eat a few minutes.  Nowhere close to being the fresh oven baked naan I am used to.  The lamb tikka marsala was something else.  The lamb was very soft and tender.  Obviously slow cooked.  The sauce was excellent and had deep flavors.  The basmati rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Probably the best tikka marsala I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great server, great food. Reasonably priced. The inside is nice and cozy feeling with a good vibe. I am glad to see an Indian style restaurant close to home. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great menu and wonderful food. This was my first time and I will for sure be back. I was scared to try Indian food but they have so many different kinds of dishes and they will explain everything in your dish if you ask and give you an honest opinion on the slickness. They have a great happy hour too! The staff was fairly attentive but it took a long time for them to come pick up the check."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and always good. They take reservations. FYI. Start off with garlic naan with dipping sauces, they spicy one, yes! Share a Taj Mahal, it's hot outside, so refreshing. Main dishes chicken galam for the squid and spicy vindaloo with spicy naan, add Hindu hot sauce, oh yeah sinus is clear!! Overall the place is a can't mess highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was good and flavorful. The rice was naan was excellent. The price for the food is on the high side for Indian food compared to the local area. Nice dinning atmosphere."}
{"text":"Quinoa salad with chicken is to die for.  I get it weekly. Great service, clean restaurant...Very impressive."}
{"text":"First of all, very impressive with the bar and restaurant deco. It is clean and staff were all very friendly.  We had samosa, garlic nan and lamb vindaloo.  Food were dynamite. It is by far the Best authentic Indian food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"My go to indian restaurant was Dhaba but I believe we have found our new favorite.  The atmosphere is more appealing than most Indian restaurants and the food is simply so fresh and delicious.  We loved the naan bread and the sauces were exceptional and spicy.  Additionally, there is buzz about the place so eating out here is fun.  You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Marigold Madison never disappoints....and it is more than reasonably priced. It is our go to place if we are feeling like Indian food! My favorite dish here is the vindaloo with lamb! Perfectly spicy, with explosive flavors, and lamb that melts in your mouth. For a comfort dish, order chicken tikka masala...but honestly, I've never tried anything I didn't like here."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner here. The service was wonderful from start to finish. We started with samosas, which were so flavorful with a perfect amount of spicy heat. Our entrees (chicken curry spicy and chicken tikka masala medium) as well as our side of aloo gobi medium were not as flavorful as the samosas. The flavor was good start, but the spices could be kicked up quite a bit in my opinion, and I don't like too much spice. The rice and garlic nann staples were good. Overall, it was good (a little pricey) but if we return, I would ask for a lot more flavor and heat."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the valley . Pure heaven .If you don't try out these place you'll be missing out big time ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been hoping to find a great nearby Indian place..we were pretty happy to discover Marigold Maison! Everything we had was seriously excellent. Service was great too, very attentive. We started off with naan stuffed with potatoes and peas which was absolutely awesome. I liked how on the menu they say what is vegan, vegetarian, and/or gluten free. Could easily take my family here with their different dietary needs! I got daal which was red and black beans, it was amazing! Not spicy though, maybe would've liked a little bit of spice. My boyfriend got some kind of drink that tasted like ginger lemonade, it was so good. He also loved his chicken tikki masala, said he could drink the sauce it was so good! We also got regular naan which was yummy. Rice was great too. We were very happy with everything! Pricey but completely worth it!"}
{"text":"Authentic, friendly serving both North and Southern cuisine.  Salty lassie is the best I have had in US. Go for lunch to experience it at a reduced price but can serve dinner menu as well."}
{"text":"Imagine the best Indian food you've ever had.  Now UP that flavor by 3 levels and that's what you get with Marigold.  We discovered this gem of a culinary experience from other yelp reviews.  :)  It's even better than my Indian family member's cooking (and her cooking is divine!)  My favorite by far is going at lunch for the seafood platter (they have a much better sounding name for it).  For $15 you get rice, soup, salad, naan, curry shrimp, coconut shrimp, and desert.  And each flavor is more enticing than the other.  I joked that the other customers might think it was weird to lick the bowls clean, but that's exactly what I wanted to do. Haa!  Be sure to get a reservation - especially at dinner - because seating is limited.  It's in an unassuming strip mall and you would never know what deliciousness awaits you if you didn't know it was there.  But you NEED to go.  Seriously.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"WOWZERS! I'm always cautious of Indian Food but this place is LEGIT! Great clean and fresh flavors. Everything is bursting with a complex flavor that makes it fun to eat.   Go here! Eat the food! Be amazed!"}
{"text":"First time here everything was so delicious! I brought my parents who live out of state and can be hard to please, they said it was the best Indian food they've ever had!  Their naan bread is amazing and the prices are reasonable! We will be back."}
{"text":"Yelp Phoenix weekly last week had a list of Indian food.... When I saw it, all of them listed looked very good including this place.  I came here for early lunch the other day, and really enjoyed my food here. They do get busy, I am glad I arrived here around 11:30am.  Around the peak lunch hour, they were completely full with some people in queue.  I tried their iced chai tea. It has a nice bold tea flavor to it, I really enjoyed it. I think I would have enjoyed more if it was hot.  (It was still hot outside so I wanted iced tea but next time I will order hot tea).   I had tandori shrimp. Shrimp is served still in the shell but they prepared nicely to eat to peel off. Shrimp had a very nice tandori oven cooked flavor to it, I enjoyed without any sauce as well as some of the sauce. My favorite was green one. They had four difference sauce, each was good.  Basmati rice was very good, I enjoyed it with red sauce. (I don't know what they are but tasty.  I asked for the name but I couldn't remember them).  For desert, I tried Rasmalai, Indian Cheesecake.  I never had Rasmalai before. In fact I never heard of the name before.  No pictures on the menu, I decided to try anyway as I like cheesecake.  Well, it was nothing like cheesecake I thought. I was actually quite taken back when I first saw it served. It ended up being quite good, very light, perfect way to end Indian meal. I thought it helped me settle my tummy.   I didn't get to try any of their curry. I am looking forward to my next visit here and try their curry."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food, service, and a great experience. Highly highly recommend coming by marigold ASAP. Even if you don't have time, grab food to go."}
{"text":"A bit pricy for dinner, but great for lunch.  I really like their Kati Roll and frequently cater it for work events even though a few of my colleagues are snobs and say it's not authentic.  Be sure to ask for a little heat, since \"regular\" is a little too bland...it's Indian food after all and should have a bit of spice to it."}
{"text":"I wonder what the hype about this place is. To sum it up - There are far better restaurants serving much more \"authentic Indian\", not worth your money and travel time, especially if your driving up from the South.   Now a bit more deeper into what a family of four  ordered here -  A Veg Platter  , Lamb Platter and Chicken Platter - it was a lunch special (so much for the special-ness )  Platter all combined - The Bad : 1)The Platter had a standard Yellow Dal - which was Bland utterly Bland. 2)The Paneer was overcooked in the saag paneer, 3)The Chicken Masala was Sweet - soo much for the masala 4)The Cold Jeer Rice served with it 5) The Priceand the quantity - @14$ per platter you are better off having a sumptuous buffet at some decent Indian Restaurant and eating to your fill rather than being limited by their sub-par quality of food  The good : 1) The Lamb vindaloo was the only highlight 2) The Jamoon had a good texture and was well done  The Ugly : SERVICE - the Server we had was possibly the worst we have encountered ever , we had to keep mentioning everything twice and keep reminding him we had an order we placed. Here you are \"required\" to tip even if you had a bad service experience, well we did.  Can you believe he had the audacity to come up and say he cant accept such a Low tip (which could have been better off had it been a ZERO) ? Bravo !!  And yeah, they serve you Half a Naan in the platter - soo much for cost cutting!  Ambiance:     2.0/5 Food taste:    2.0/5  Service:         0.0/5 Price:             2.0/5 Overall:          1.0/5  This place stands as a testimony of mocking Indian Food by all standards  Sub Par non-authentic Food, unmetered prices and topped with horrendous Service - welcome to MariGold  AVOID IT!!"}
{"text":"Still serving delicious Indian food at a good price. Try the combo lunch platter for a taste of many great selections."}
{"text":"Good homemade Indian food. Service is great. Had the chicken tikka and garlic naan. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Marigold Maison twice now, and I can understand why it's always packed... it is centrally located, offers a casual and friendly environment, moderate prices, quality Indian cuisine, and attentive service.   On my first visit with a few girlfriends, we went on a weeknight and shared a few things family style: Masala Dosa, Shrimp Tikka Masala, and Chicken Kashmir Korma... with naan and rice as well.  I took a bite of one friend's Quinoa Salad too.  That night everything was divine!    On my next visit, I went with my husband, and it was a Saturday night.  The place was beyond packed and the waitstaff beyond slammed, but still attentive and friendly.  Actually, Abraham was an incredible waiter, making suggestions upon request and chatting with us throughout the time we spent there.  However, the food was not quite as amazing as I remembered.  We had the Shrimp Tikka Masala, the Saag Spinach with Chicken, with naan and rice.  The Tikka was a bit too rich and buttery, and the Saag was lacking in flavor ironically.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I talked it up to be.  I'm hoping it was just an off night as I do hope to return again!  I specifically would like to return to try the Biryani Hyderabadi with lamb... I saw a few tables had it and it comes highly recommended!  Worth noting that this place serves beer, wine and natural refreshments... and they do take reservations.  They also offer delivery via postmates."}
{"text":"My second visit just as good or better than my first.  Came with the wife this time.  I had the lamb vindaloo which is one of the best I've had with the hard to find in Phoenix appropriate spice level- awesome!!!  Somosas are a great starter with a hint of spice.  My wife had a Marigold platter which had lentil soup, salad, naan and both chicken tikka masala and curry chicken.  What a nice little platter...actually pretty big and way too much for lunch.    The $6 pitcher of beer was another nice bonus.   My first visit was in their old tight confines.  This time they were showcasing their new layout replete with an outdoor eating area, twice as much dining space and a private dining room.   By far my new favorite Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to give it 4 stars because they got rid of my favorite Macedonian wine on their wine list, but I am not that type of a person, this place is legit.  Great food and atmosphere, came down here on a Wednesday night around 7-8PM and it was packed.   We shared a couple of aps and some small plates, they were all really good. You won't make a mistake by choosing whatever from the menu."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Marigold Maison.  First, they are on Open Table which is always a plus for getting reservations.  We came in on a weeknight and the place was busy which is also a great sign.  That being said, the food fell below expectations.  Everything was OK, but just OK.  The prices seemed a little steep - $50+ for two people (no alcohol) seems pricey for a weeknight meal!"}
{"text":"I hate to leave a negative review, but I couldn't help but be a little let down with this place. We came in on a Sunday at lunch time and took the waiter's recommendation for the platter options. If we're speaking of taste: pretty good! However, the portions were far from heaping and the naan provided was enough for about five bites. When we ordered more naan, between 10 and 15 minutes passed before it made its way to the table, by which time the remainder of our food had gone cold. It's worth mentioning that the place became very busy during that time, and this deal-breaking service could very likely be attributed to this factor."}
{"text":"Yummy !!! This place it's a hidden jewel , when I received the call from my friends about Indian food is said \" I don't like Indian food \" ... I end up there ... well for the ones that read my reviews they know I am a steak person - no steak there for sure ... but I was able to try a bit of everything and OMg ! DELICIOUS ! Service was great , margarita was great - I had difficulties with the menu but .... the server was very knowledgeable . Will go back again.  Unique little place"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great, fresh ingredients and excellent service. Order anything that they make in the Tandoor--the bread, meat, seafood--everything that comes out of that oven is to die for. I loved their paneer tikka and samosa as apps and LOVED the tandoori specialities."}
{"text":"The menu is tight and they stick to what they know how to make. The Naan is more breadlike than I'm used to, but it was very good.   The platter is well worth the price and a great option if you want to sample a lot of the things they offer.   Prices are good. Hope this place thrives. There aren't enough good Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will definitely come back! It smells amazing when you walk in. I got the Lamb curry and it was the best I've ever had! Everyone was so nice and seemed to really care about my experience."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today with my colleagues at office. I liked the vegetable thali, it was delicious. Moreover I got the authentic Indian taste in daal; something I had been longing for since I came to U.S.  With food being excellent and service being good, I felt the price is higher.. All went well until I was in for a ride shock- gratuity! Yes they collect gratuity for large groups and they didn't mention it in the beginning..I was disappointed with this. Won't rule out visiting again but definitely not in a large group."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the chicken thali (I think that was what it was called), which was basically a sampler plate with a number of different items on it. The portions were perfect and everything was great. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderfully prepared and served on outside patio. My husband and I ate here last year when we were in Scottsdale. This year we remembered how good the food was and returned. We enjoyed another excellent meal. The Mango salad which we shared was delicious. I had the Tikka Marsala, chicken - fabulous mixture of spices. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly. We completed our meal with mango sorbet.  Service team very good.  Highly recommend. Next time we are in Phoenix area we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The lentil cakes are BOMBBB!!! This place is delish, and now we foUnd one more thing that we love. We order out and eat leftovers for a couple nights- samosas (yum!), korma, saag, naan, raiita  and I love how they put a couple peas on the rice as a garnish.   When calling in our order, the connection was a bit difficult because of the loudness in restaurant, but all good!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3-5 times now.  Same owners as Roka Akor, one of my all time favorite restaurants, so you know that quality is going to be there as they settle for nothing but the best.  Very casual and quite atmosphere.  Service is fast and friendly.  Food is flavorful and has depth to it.  You can go no heat to quite hot.  Severs are good about explaining the dishes and levels of heat, flavors, etc.    Give this place a shot if you like Indian Food or aren't sure if you do because they will make you a believer!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious but the customer service makes this place really special. Abraham and Gina are so nice and knowledgeable. I haven't tried their lunch menu yet but dinner is outstanding."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my meals at Marigold.  Tonight was a perfect example of why Marigold has so many great reviews.  They care.  As happens with all businesses, even the best of them, sometimes things just go wrong from start to finish.  Tonight's dinner was just that.  It was so uncharacteristic of them that at the end of dinner I felt compelled to speak to our server about it.  As a well-trained, caring professional himself, he relayed the message, and soon Mr. Kumar arrived to discuss.  And a true discussion it was; polite, respectful, sincere, eager to immediately improve the situation, and followed-up (before we left) to relay his findings regarding the events, etc. The handling of the situation was exceptional. We left feeling appreciated and will certainly come back very soon.  Going out for dinner is so much more than just the meal, and tonight reaffirmed why so many appreciate Marigold Maison.  Oh and yes, the Naan is as delicious as you read in the reviews :) Namaste!"}
{"text":"Great experience. I ordered the lamb thali and and my hubby had the chicken curry. We order samosa appetizer. The naan wasn't hot enough but the rest of the thali platter was delicious.  Our server Luke was very busy. He did a fabulous job of taking care of all the patrons. We will return. I have to try their tandoori. There was a loud beeping sound possibly coming from the kitchen that was annoying. Our lunch was $40 without tip."}
{"text":"This is a small but packed with people Indian restaurant. Both with indoor and outdoor seats, I like the vibe of it. They have lunch menus that has some limited dishes but they have some platters (called Thali) which includes combo of some dishes as taster. I tried Chicken Curry and my girlfriend tried Lamb Thali, both very well made except the salad and lentil soup were tasteless.  It was like salad didn't have any dressing and there was no salt in lentil soup. The waiter was very friendly. Gotta try their dinner menu too but so far my experience was positive.  Also if you like iced tea, you may be surprised with their version of ice tea. It is made in house by the chef, has clove and coriander in it which is very refreshing and different. Another surprise was that they charge for soda water which was unusual but waiter took it out of my bill."}
{"text":"Food : Very tasty delicacies! We ordered Pani Puri as Appetizer and Aloo Naan, Onion Naan, Paneer Tikka Masala for main course. Each dish was great! The Pani Puri was slightly off (we've tasted better) but the rest of the dishes were spot on! Such soft naans and creamy gravy! I specially liked that you can pick a gravy/sauce as base and add veggies/paneer/chicken/meat of your choice to it. Made to order, and yummy!!! Service : Excellent! Very attentive staff. Ambience : Good decor complimented by Indian paintings and photographs. Indian music completes the experience Price : Competitive to other Indian restaurants. Sizable portions and taste make it worth paying slightly more too. Parking : Big lot outside Overall : Great! Definitely making this a regular!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We were transported! The gorgeous mural and the fragrant air set the stage for an absolutely sensory and satisfying evening. The saag paneer! Everything down to the naan and raita were spot on. Start with dosas and samosas! This is my new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I use to think that Indian food wasn't really for me....because the first time I tried it, I got really sick. I was really hesitant to visit because I never wanted to relive that moment, but I wanted to try something new in the area and with the awesome reviews, how could I not?  We came in at 5:30p on a Saturday night. The restaurant wasn't packed yet but as continued our dining experience, the restaurant slowly started to get busier and busier. Service could be improved as we didn't get as much attention as we would like. You can tell we never have been and I was asking for recommendations. We decided on the Butter Shrimp appetizer, Tikka Masala Chicken and Garlic Naan. I also decided to order the Mango Lassi drink.   The Mango Lassi tasted like a milk smoothie - it was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The food though - was ridiculously amazing! I loved every bite - the crispy naan, the rice, the shrimp was flavorful, tender and succulent, and the chicken was delicious! Yelpers, you didn't lead me astray on this one!   Our bill was close to $50 with tip but well worth it when you enjoyed pretty much everything that was ordered. My advice is to get there early because it gets packed around 6p!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Indian food and ambiance. If your not sure what to have enjoy the platter that gives you a little bite of everything. Order extra Naan bread..."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian food that I have had in the valley, we normally order Postmates delivery but we recently visited for lunch and service was excellent. I didn't realize they closed at 2:30 for a few hours and we got there right at 2:30 and invited us in without any hesitation. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were top notch.  The platter is the way to go as you get salad, soup, meal and rice pudding for dessert.  I don't even like rice but this was wonderful and my husband had his fork in all my food!  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time, nicely presented dishes and great food. Some of the dishes tasted okay but overall food and experience was great."}
{"text":"Best Indian in town! The chicken tika masala is incredible, order it spicy and the naan is a MUST....it hits the spot. Their new renovation is lovely and happy for the success. Steve is always a pleasure and great manager. Wonderful service from Pushpa and other servers. The food is excellent, the flavors are just incredible. Very authentic and (best part) healthy, I highly recommend!  Love,  Your neighbors at Hand and Stone Massage and Facial Spa"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The 'Chipotle' comment referred to the Bombay Spice concept.  That was good but this is a slightly more upscale restaurant with Much better food. The Chicken Tikka Masala had a beautiful, rich sauce with tender chicken. The Mango salad was very light and refreshing. Thanks to Gina for her great service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Not only because the food is amazing, but because the staff are always pleasant and welcoming and their service is fast. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been here approximately 5-6 times. The service is good, what you would expect in an Indian restaurant. This place is good, perhaps a bit on the pricey side around dinner time (relatively), but their Thali lunch platter is an excellent value. For dinner, I would highly recommend the chicken tikka masala with the spice on the side, as they do not make it particularly spicy and everyone's spice tolerance is different. The portions are decent, could be a bit larger for the price, but enough to satisfy most people. The atmosphere is classy, yet casual, a great place for lunch or dinner with someone special, although it is not particularly quiet and does not offer much privacy, especially around dinner time. Indian Paradise was our favorite restaurant in town and our go-to for a quick dinner, but now that they have closed we will be frequenting the Marigold Maison as it is a close second. We look forward to coming here often in the future."}
{"text":"Tried this new Indian food restaurant in our neighborhood. Exactly what we have been looking for. Great service. Great food. Recommend reservations, but not necessary."}
{"text":"My semester ended, I am thoroughly exhausted and decided that I'd treat myself and order delivery from Marigold. This is my first time ever having their food, but the reviews were mostly glowing.   I fired up my uber eats app and ordered 1 order of Seafood Thali and 1 order of Chicken Thali and a potato stuffed naan. What we didn't know is that the food would also come with salad, dessert, soup and plain naan. We were not only blown away with the generous portions, but the flavor is fantastic and rich, with sumptuous sauces and large prawns and tender white meat chicken. If the delivery is this great, I'm excited to go in-person soon!  10/10 would recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have finally found my favorite Indian cuisine. Its a lit bit far from my house since i live in Mesa but i dont really mind driving if i could get what i want. Love their garlic naan OMG so fresh. Will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"I've been hoping an amazing Indian restaurant would open up in Phoenix. It's happened! Food was delicious and authentic. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Chicken tikka masala, amazing! Vindaloo was authentically spicy!"}
{"text":"Not realy indian food. The idea is pretty, the interior is pretty... the wait staff is nice... but the food is awful... the mango lasse and the chai were really bad. All of the curries were so liquidy..."}
{"text":"We ordered masala dosa and vegetable thali both were not good .   1.dosa was not crispy and potato curry inside dosa was too dry . Coconut chutney was not fresh and not tasty at all and sambar was ok.  2.vegetable thali - naan was not fresh and chole dint taste like indian curry , dal was bad."}
{"text":"Great food but without many vegan options for lunch it truly leaves you with a handful of items to pick from."}
{"text":"How do you stay in business making terrible food ?? 3 different orders in a week - am done and not recommending this place to anyone . I've had 'Americanized' Indian food but never this bad.  First order - chicken tikka , garlic naan  Tikka was bland , naan was ok.  Second order - gobi manchurian , onion naan. Who makes gobi manchurian with teriyaki sauce?? It was very sweet and no other flavor. Have you not had this dish before or is a 'nobody' just winging it in the kitchen ?  Naan - ok.  Third order - ordered by accident by my girlfriend who had never ordered from here before . Didn't get a chance to warn her.  Biriyani - fat rice and absolutely no flavor . Hakka noodles - I've had some bad Chinese - beats that !  Chicken tikka - didn't disappoint - flavorless and very bland."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best Indian food I've ever had. Everything we ave tried is absolutely delicious!!  The lamb vindaloo is unreal, spicy and so flavorful. I also love the chicken tikka masala and the seared eggplant is a delicious appetizer. You really can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"Really good Indian food, with some South Indian twists such as dosa appetizers, plus several chaat. The korma and vindaloo were especially good. The naan was perfect. The saag paneer was the only disappointment because it wasn't stewed spinach but spinach-infused cream sauce, so a bit bland in flavor and texture. You need reservations for dinner due to its popularity unless you come after 8:30pm."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I must easily have spent over 10,000 dollars worth of food throughout all of the many, many, many, times we have been to this place! Marigold Maison is easily my favorite restaurant of all times. We've been coming here actually when they were at a different location with a different name many years ago, and it's been awesome to follow their changes and growth, and they still have us coming back!! The chef is wowwwwwww, he does some magic with his hands! The seasonings, the flavorings, everything is fresh and made right there, you can literally watch them make your food, and it tastes so so so good. My favorite thing to get is the tandoori style salmon with naan bread and I could eat it almost everyday it tastes so freaking good. Their sauces are spectacular, the staff is super cool and friendly, we've gotten quite acquainted with them since we go there so regularly, and they are just good genuine people which makes going there even better. I recommend this place for everyone, even if you feel like it's not your typical style of food, it is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor but wasn't that much ambiance.  Came here for lunch around 12:30pm with my Bollywood dance instructor and the place was half empty.  I had chicken thali ( like tapas/samplers style) and I requested spicy, but the food was mild for my taste. I just didn't get the kick of the flavor that I was looking for.  The service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Love this place...great food every time and they recently expanded. Everything is reasonably priced and you can count on excellent service."}
{"text":"We loveeeeeeeeeee Marigold! 50% of the time we order delivery and the other 50% we dine in- either way the food is always top notch delicious!!  We usually order the vegetarian Somosa's, Paneer Tikki Masala, and usually a curry or vegetarian dish, plus Garlic Naan. Seriously so great! They have mint, yogurt and hot sauce dips on the side that go perfectly with every dish, and everything just has so much flavor! Marigold is usually eaten in our house 1-2 a week! Thank god the portions are big, so leftovers are always an option!   This is one of our favorite restaurants ever!"}
{"text":"My experience at Marigold Maison was amazing! Great food (FULL OF FLAVOR), tasteful drinks that were very \"bang for your buck\" with their Barmenu, awesome service from the bartender John, and manager Abraham made sure we were taken care of. If you love a relaxed atmosphere and fun service, definitely recommend Marigold Maison."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Marigold Maison! We ordered the lunch platters.. both the lamb thali and the chicken thali were incredibly yummy!! This is definitely the best Indian Restaurant in town! We'll be coming back soon again. :-)"}
{"text":"Love the food here ... It's very pricey for the quantity they serve... But the food tastes great and has no artificial addons to it ... Tastes like home cooked food ..: only if they were cheaper for the very less quantity of the food they serve ..  Had veg thali, okra curry, veg biryani and mango lassi... All of them were awesome.."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  Seriously.  They need to hire professional servers. Service doesn't match the food."}
{"text":"If you are in search of legit Indian food, you won't be disappointed in this quaint, little restaurant.  Very clean, fast service and very tasty seasoned entrées.  Get the Mango Salad, Lamb Curry and Spicy Naan."}
{"text":"Great food. Many choices, would love to taste everything. So far tried the masala chicken and it was delicious and another chicken dish recommended by the server but it was too spicy and he offered to take it back and add more cream which took some of the spiciness. I can't wait to go again to try their other dishes. ."}
{"text":"Yes! I'm giving this 5 stars and here's why....Exceptional Service, Great Tasting Food, and Nice Atmosphere.  Just to show you how exceptional our service was, I've numbered every time someone attended to us during our time there.  My husband and I went here for our 15th wedding anniversary.  We always go to an Indian restaurant for our anniversary.  We usually have Indian food at an all-vegetarian Indian restaurant in Phoenix, but the food quality has become very inconsistent over the past year. So we searched online for a new restaurant and found Marigold Maison.  We were greeted immediately by (1) Mirnes Mehic, Director of Marketing, as soon as we walked in the door.  I know his name because he stopped by our table and chatted with us after our meal, talking about the restaurant, the chef, the food. He gave us his card.  We were in a corner table which was very cozy even though just about every table was filled.  The décor is lovely.    Shortly after we were seated another (2) gentleman came over to let us know that our waitress would be with us soon but he could get our drinks.  Our (3) waitress soon arrived, was very friendly and took our order.  Before we really noticed that our food seemed to be taking a little longer than would be expected, our waitress came to tell us it would be out soon and placed a basket of complimentary papadums on the table.  We are vegetarians so we had: Dal Makhani, Saag Paneer, Masala Dosa, Garlic Naan, and Mango Lassi.   The food was excellent!!  Saag Paneer was some of the best we've had.  Masala Dosa was LOADED with potato, Dal Makhani was very flavorful, and the Garlic Naan was fantastic.  We had the leftover Dal and Saag the next day and it was even tastier.   A little warning, the hot sauce that's on the tables is not for the faint of heart. HOT, HOT but very flavorful and you can buy a bottle to take home.  During our meal a (4) gentleman came over the refill our drinks and take away any used dishes.  Another (5) lady came over later to remove any more dishes we were finished with.  Our waitress stopped by often to check on us.  Mirnes Mehic stopped by the table and spoke with us.  He stopped by again later to present us with a complementary Mango Kulfi for our anniversary!  As if we hadn't already received enough excellent service, (6) The Chef stopped by our table!  He talked about the ingredients he puts in the foods like olive oil, as well as those he leaves out like ghee, heavy cream, and cashew giving the food a less 'heavy' feeling on the body.  Great Experience and Great Food to be had at Marigold Maison!"}
{"text":"Accommodating. Friendly. Professional. Delicious. This was a wonderful experience in true Indian cuisine. A must try and an asset to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhmazing!!!!!!   The staff is so friendly and passionate about the menu! The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the food is by far the best Indian food I have ever had!   Must try the tikka masala with lamb, so flavorful and tender! The garlic naan is absolutely to die for!   Fair prices for the truly delicious and  authentic food you are getting.   I have been here 3x in the past month and can not say enough positive things about this restaurant! Do your tastebuds a favor and try this place ASAP, you'll have wished you had gone sooner!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was great! We used to come here years ago when it was called Bombay Spice and it was located a mile south on Tatum and Shea. The delightful Kate K and I mutually decided to come here and try out their menu. They have a pretty spectacular happy hour menu from 5-7pm if you sit at the patio/bar area.  We tried their veggie samosas, papadum, and chicken tikka. Everything tasted yummy and the sauces were the perfect accompaniment to our food: mint chutney, yogurt and tamarind. For happy hour prices, the amount of food we got was filling.  Service was excellent as we got our order quickly and our water was filled frequently. I'd like to come back and try their lunch thali. Glad to see that this place is still consistent and although it wasn't super busy they had quite a few people dining."}
{"text":"I'm usually not very 'adventurous' in my meals. But I'll eat anything they make.  The chicken tiki masala is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine in Phoenix greater area. The different types of sauces, whether masala, various curries, vindaloo, etc., are so delicious. I recommend the diverse platters that have many of these sauces and various eats. The service was also great, which gives this place its well-deserved fifth star."}
{"text":"I have been to Marigold twice now. The food is delicious and the service has been average     Old: For spicy lovers, this is not the place for you. I've tried both times to get my meal spicy and they seem incapable of doing so. For most people, it's probably spicy enough. I'd expect more from an Indian restaurant though.  Updated: They made it deliciously spicy today."}
{"text":"The Goan vindaloo , finally I've left a new restaurant in the Phoenix area happy that , no one tried to warn me about the heat and two wasreally the best rendition of this dish I've had in years that I didn't make myself.  Sour, spicy with a great texture that sticks to the naan and rice which, at least for me, is just the perfect size for an evening curry.  Add in Naan a cut above those poor thin uniform excuses that are the feature of most valley buffets  and a decent appetizer section  and I can no longer claim there's not a decent Indian restaurant within 10 miles of the house.  Again this is just based on one dish but that's really all I need. I really wanted to try a bunch of the appetizers but I could see $40 lunch occurring and  that just wasn't a today thing.  Great service, bit pricey for  solo lunch dining and the tables for 2 , tiny,wee bit cramped, though not relevant at the time I was there.   The lunch menu is too restrictive ,the leap from lunch price to dinner will limit how much I could spend, but don't get me wrong this dish is worth the price,  but 1/2 the serving and a 1/2 naan for $10-12 would hit the sweet spot and make this a regular rather than occasional thing."}
{"text":"Marigold Maison Paradise Valley website and an email we received advertised \"All-You-Can-Eat Marigold Thali Platters are available Saturday & Sunday 11:30AM - 2:30PM | 5PM -Close\", they did not honor the special on Saturday, June 16 at 5:45PM.   Here is another quote from the website: \"$15 per person | Every Saturday and Sunday Choose from our Traditional Platter featuring signature favorites or our delicious Vegetarian option. Platters include unlimited Soup, Salad, Naan, Tandoori Specialties, Curry, Masala, and Dessert.\"  We love this restaurant and normally would give them 5 stars. This was very disappointing, and the stars are accordingly reduced."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't tried this place, being that it's walking distance of my house.  I sat on the patio which was lovely. Their cocktails are very limited but they have wine and beer.  I wasn't sure what to get but our waiter made great recommendations. I loved their spicy lamb. I'd  definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our experience was nothing like the ones mentioned below. We ordered chicken tikka masala, paneer tikka masala and dal makhani. The food taste was not good at all, to say the least, it didnt taste indian at all except the daal that was good but not dal makahni for sure. The gulab jamun was better left alone as we did."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for some good Indian food.... well really, any kind of ethnic food! I have always heard some amazing things about Marigold Maison and when I finally had the opportunity to try this place I knew I had to go!  A few must trys! Their Samosa Chaat - which is a samosa with chickpea, onion, tomato, mint, yogurt, & tamarind. It's delicious and almost a deconstructed Samosa! The chicken tikka was delicious, as was their lamb Goan Vindaloo, made with wine, red chilis, curry leaves, and mustard seeds! Their naan was a knock out as well!  Highly recommend Marigold Maison"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner Marigold Maison tonight and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and with the friendly, warm atmosphere.  We were greeted by Steve, who took very good care of us. The wait staff was knowledgable, explaining types of food, preparation and heat. They have created a friendly atmosphere where everyone feels like they are in a home where they are friends of the family.   We enjoyed the mix of flavors in the dishes that we ordered... We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is so friendly and kind. The food is amazing. Music and ambiance is on point. My new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This a good spin on Indian food, if you need authentic spicy food this is not a place to be. However, this place is amazing in it's own way. We had their Salmon Kabab and shrimp thali, both tastes good. I will recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had a great family experience at Marigold Maison.  The naan was outstanding.  The chicken dishes were superbly prepared.  Just the right amount of seasoning and delicious.  The service was also excellent.  The server was attentive and very knowledgeable.  This was an outstanding dining event."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I normally go to a buffet for Indian food and have some favorites, but they were closed this past memorial day. We opted to go here. I was very happy with the chicken tikka masala and the saag paneer. Nothing was left. We also ordered samosas, which were on the spicy side, but great. The only thing to complain about is the price. It's a touch expensive to me. But that said, there are few Indian restaurants in the valley and even fewer that are good. Try this one out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Indian food and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed! The service was very attentive and helpful. We got the Samosa, Garlic and Cilantro Naan, Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Classic Curry. They were all very good but I highly recommend the Tikka Masala! The sauce was absolutely delicious. I expected the sauces to be much spicier than they were. I preferred the more mild taste, but if you are looking for spice I would recommend ordering your dish medium or hot. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The delivery service that they advertise thru postdates is a joke and a ripoff.  Twice we have ordered home delivery and both times they have failed to include dishes that we ordered and paid for. How a restaurant this inept can stay in business is beyond me. The food was also mediocre at best, but at least we expect to get what we paid for.  When we call to complain about the incomplete orders, their is a lack of enthusiasm and concern about correcting the incompetence involved.    Perhaps the owner should have stayed in the pharmaceutical business, since he obviously cannot run a restaurant enterprise. How hard is it to package what people order online and deliver it????"}
{"text":"One of the best indian restaurants I've ever been to, and likely the best in Phoenix. Seating is very limited and only good for small parties. Really liked the bharta and garlic naan."}
{"text":"Visiting from Seattle we visited marigold as it probably had the best ratings around the area we were staying. Foodie that I am, I'd not give it more than 3 stars, food was average what you'd expect in an American Indian restaurant - nothing great. Also was pissed that they charged 20% gratuity for a party of 4, when we only had 2 adults one 7 year old and one 2 year old kid. common guys - party of 4 and 20% gratuity."}
{"text":"Majorly disappointed. I've had the luxury of spending a lot of time in India and absolutely love the food. While that doesn't make me an expert in Indian food, it makes me someone who really enjoys it. After moving to the area, finding an Indian restaurant was a top priority. Marigold Maison caught my attention because of the terrific reviews and the fact that they had two of my favorite dishes on the menu - masala dosa and aloo gobi.  I've been after my wife to try the place since we got here and she finally agreed to so I made us a reservation for Saturday night. We were seated at a two-top next to the wall around the kitchen. Not horrible, but a bit disappointing given we had made a reservation. We ordered glasses of wine and the masala dosa. When I travel to India, the masala dosa is my standard everyday breakfast. I absolutely adore them and couldn't wait for my wife to try it. The dosa served was thick - almost like a tortilla instead of the paper-thin crispy dosa I'm used to. The filling was bland and the whole thing looked like it was flattened. The highlight was the coconut chutney, but the dosa itself was not very good. To top it off, my wife's wine was flat. Clearly the bottle had been open for a while.  After the appetizer, we waited for literally 15 minutes (I looked at my phone) waiting for the entrees. This was while we watched the people who came in after us get their entrees. When the food finally arrived, it was a total letdown. The Chicken vindaloo contained dry, chewy chicken and the vindaloo's only flavor component was \"spicy\". The saag panner was probably the only highlight of the entire experience, and it gained that position by being average in a meal of below average. The aloo gobi, one of my favorite dishes, was flavorless, lacked potato (you know, the aloo in aloo gobi) and had diced tomato in it, which was a first.  The final slap in the face was a check for over $90 for a very sub-par meal and disappointing service  I really wish I had eaten in the place that the other reviewers seem to have eaten at. It sounds like a great place, but unfortunately that wasn't my experience. Super disappointed. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I have to tell you from the moment I walked in the smell was just amazing and I could not wait to taste the food.   Bathrooms were family style and very clean.  Our waitress was very nice! She got the water no ice rught the first try and the water was filtered and cold, perfect for a hot day.    We ordered the Hyderabad and Tikka Masada and they were the perfect temperature, spice and we're very tasty.  Overall one of the best dinner adventures we have had. Stop what your doing and makes reservations if you want to impress your someone with a great meal for a great price."}
{"text":"Clean place, food tastes good. Service could be better. Wish they would reduce number of tables as it's easy to bump into your neighbor's chair"}
{"text":"Marigold Maison is by far my favorite Indian Restaurant in the Valley and I have been to them all, no lie, unless one was hidden under the yelp radar.  What I enjoy most about this restaurant is the Chefs commitment to quality and innovation.  This is a Chef run, not mom and pop establishment like a majority of the Indian Restaurants we frequent.  Not to say that home grown traditional Indian food is not delish, but sometimes its nice to take it up a notch and add some elegant flair to the cuisine.  We attended the first mothers day brunch buffet they presented this year and it was amazing!  From soup to nuts they covered it all.  I was particularly enamored with the pork ribs they served.  We spoke with the chef who walked us through how he created the recipe, taking a traditional american BBQ staple and putting an Indian spin on it, genius.  On a more recent visit, I ordered a mango salad and asked to add chicken tika (not masala).  I rarely find a salad at an Indian restaurant that isn't just cucumber and onion.  This salad was so flavorful and full of surprises, mangoes, cashews, and other stuff I can't remember but all together made the most memorable salad I have had in quite a while. The Chef sent us some appetizers, chickpea batter dipped chicken strips, samosa and samosa chaat, loved by all guests in our party.  My father in law is recovering from bypass surgery so we asked for heart friendly suggestions. Once again the superstar chef came through with the suggestion of Tandoori Chicken which at the Marigold Maison is a cornish hen, Eggplant Bharta, and Biryani (small portion due to high carb content of course).  All dishes were excellent as usual.  Service was kind, attentive, and committed to ensuring we had everything we needed.  Atmosphere and ambience is simple and elegant, restaurant is a  clean and very attractive space. Bring back those ribs please!!!"}
{"text":"I came in and had lunch with my wife and she got the chicken tikka misala. I got the shrimp korma. And it was AMAZING!!! Best Indian food I have ever had!!! Hands down!!!! Service was on point and quick. And our server told us that the restaurant is going to be remodeled with a bar. Super excited about this! They gained a new regular! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love the food very good enjoyed every dish we ordered Lamb chops,chicken Tikka masala,golgpas,masala dosa, Gobi manchurian,chicken pakodas,and more dishes we were 12 people."}
{"text":"Really very good. I can't comment on the table service (we always get take out), but the food is excellent. We order at least once a week. My personal favorite is the lamb tikka masala. The lamb is tender, the sauce is perfectly seasoned, and the rice in beautifully prepared and so  fragrant. We also enjoy the lamb vindaloo and the chicken biryani. And the naan is just perfect."}
{"text":"A amazing place for Indian food the quality of food is incredible. Highly recommend for everyone. They take pride in every dish they make and it's really refreshing to see."}
{"text":"Like the Second Best Marigonld Hotel movie, this didn't quite live up to my expectations.  We tried a sampling of appetizers and entrees.  The ground chicken dip appetizer and samosas were quite good - the chicken is served with naan for dipping and is creamy good.  The samosas were hot and crispy on the outside.  For entrees, we tried the standby tikka masala, which seemed too much like thick tomato soup for me.   The kashmir korma was good but pretty bland - it was ordered mild, but ended up not being very flavorful.  The vindaloo was hot and spicy as expected.  We also tried a tandoori shrimp and the shrimp biryani.  Both were good, but would have been better without the shells of the shrimp.  It was crowded and felt a bit cramped, but may have to try it for a quieter lunch to see if it's more relaxing.  Prices are overall fair, but creep up quickly if you order a glass of wine or two at $10 each (samosa, tikka, naan, 2 wines = over $50 with tip.  Overall, it was OK and competes with other Indian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant. Used to be a different cuisine, then changed to Indian (my favorite).  Fantastic food, not the best Indian place around, but pretty quality.  I wouldn't suggest this for a date night, it's a smaller restaurant, seems informal as compared to other Indian food restaurants.  Only take the spicy food if you can handle it. Seriously. It's hot for even me, someone who eats hot Indian often.  The tandoori chicken is a bit overpriced, but fantastic.  The rest of the food is great!"}
{"text":"This place surely lives up to all the great reviews that it has earned on Yelp.The decor is basic and the menu is limited but well thought of. They have all the typical curries like Tikka Masala,Vindaloo,korma, makhani and saag.Also the quintessential south Indian dishes like Dosa and Idly. The lunch menu is a VFM kind of deal you have options for Vegetable/chicken/Lamb/Seafood.All the thali's are served with rice,dal,naan,and gulab jamun(My Favorite). The Quinoa salad (Quinoa, chickpea, cucumber, tomato, onions, tossed in fresh citrus juices) has the makings of an interesting fusion dish.  They also have some street food options like Samosa chaat,Aloo chaat ,Bhel and Golguppa. I tried their Golguppa and i wouldn't cal it excellent but it did help fill the void in my heart until i visit India again.Now Golguppa also known as Pani puri is Whole wheat puffs with potato, chickpea, and spice water.It must be popped into the mouth whole to be enjoyed in all its glory.I would say it's a Must try. Anyone from India knows Golguppa is not just street food it's a CULT!!!  The staff is friendly and attentive.They also have outdoor seating. It's a good place for simple,fresh and delicious Indian food.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Garlic naan: was good, nothing special. Thicker texture   Malai kofta: I asked for spicy, it was bland. Very bland. The taste was good otherwise.   Chicken tikka masala: also bland, mostly just tasted like tomato and sweet. Tasted like tomato bisque.  Not authentic Indian food.   I would not return here for the food as the pricing was expensive for what we received.   However, good service recovery as they gave us free mango lassi when we said the spice wasn't up to our level. The mango lassi was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The service was great, but food needs a bit of work. The tikka masala was very oily (both the lamb and chicken)."}
{"text":"Marigold Maison is one of the newer Indian \"foodie \" restaurants in the Phoenix area. Located in an area populated by strip malls and run of the mill fast food fare, Marigold Maison is elegantly presented from the outside and does not disappoint on the inside. If you go for dinner a reservation might be a good idea because the place fills up quickly, since it has a small to dining room. There is also a small outside patio area wine bar which is enclosed (smart idea on their part). If you go there for your favorite wine or beer after work, they have a pretty good list of libations that are paired perfectly with their delicious appetizers! Space is limited. The menu features many traditional Indian dishes, along with some inventive new takes on Indian for health conscious foodies. When we went there, the waiter was attentive although very busy. The food we ordered, came out faster than I expected and it was delicious, well presented, but not steaming hot. We were so stuffed I barely had room for my favorite dessert Galab Jamun! YUM.  A banquet room is also available but was not used at the time we went. We were nearly the first ones in at their 5pm opening but it filled to capacity by the time we left. The only drawback I thought was they only have iced Chai, and just \"hot tea\" in place of authentic Indian Chai tea made in a saucepan. Our tea water was barely lukewarm, and the whole concept of traditional hot Chai after a meal seemed lost in the Phoenix area's love of iced teas and coffees. All over though I really liked the food and atmosphere, which would have me returning to eat there again."}
{"text":"Marigold is THE BEST Indian food I've had!  The food is incredible, along with the service. Each and every waitor/bartender pay close attention to my experience and make sure this restaurant goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! We have been back three times now and every time the food and service have been excellent! I like that you can pick how much heat you want in each dish and the freshness of the food. The sauces are off the charts good - that garlic non-bread is heavenly and you have to have it! We have tried chicken and lamb chicken masala the lamb vindaloo and about for other dishes in the samosas which are off the chart good too! I just recommended Marigold to two more of my  friends today!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here and I was not disappointed.  Food was amazing, service was great, and food was very reasonably priced.  I got the chicken platter.  It came with a salad, soup, 2 entrees, rice, and desert.  I left very full, even had leftovers, and only spent $14 on the meal.  There chicken masala is my favorite and a must try!"}
{"text":"Lamb vindaloo was very tender, good for southern style Indian but missed the mark on the heat."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service could use a little help and organization in the front of the house"}
{"text":"My husband and I became incredible Ill after eating here, the sickest Ive ever been in my life. It kept me from photographing a very important wedding. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow - this could be my new favorite place in Phoenix! A great variety of indian dishes that isn't a buffet. I really enjoyed the Chicken Thali platter which came with several side dishes. I couldn't tell you what they all were but each of them had tons of great flavor and nothing was too spicy. Portion sizes were also generous and the platter was served with a side of naan. Staff was also very attentive!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch.  Quality food, great flavors and taste.  I like the Chicken and Lamb Thali lunch platters.  The Kati rolls (packaged like a burrito) are good as well.  Definitely need to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"This food was the best Indian food I've ever had and I'm from NY. We need one of these here. Food was delicious and service was great. A must"}
{"text":"Hands down knock your socks off delicious Indian food. What I loved most about their lunch special is that you get a little bit of everything. Yummy little bowls filled with goodness come out on your own personal platter.  Each little dish was unique and delicious in its own way. The flavors are robust and appealing to your taste buds. I ate every single morsel treasuring each bite. Can't wait to try a different dish next time!   Btw. The service is phenomenal. When I told our waitress my lack of knowledge of the Indian cuisine, she went over every thing on my platter in great detail. She was an extremely hospitable server."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place. But was sadly disappointed. The food just wasn't that good especially for the price. The service was mediocre and the atmosphere felt cheap.   I won't be back"}
{"text":"Very bland and tasteless!  We requested spicy curry and we were brought some sliced peppers which is how you add heat.  Lamb was expensive, tasteless and cooked horribly.  They were out of Chai and Dosa's which is why we went there.  Tikka Masala was made with coconut milk which made it sweet and no spice or heat to it.  The taste was to appeal to westerners not true Indian Food.  The Vegetable Pakora were outstanding which is the reason why I gave 2 stars.  Staff seemed uncomfortable and clueless about Indian Food.  Very overpriced"}
{"text":"The best Indian food, hands down, anywhere. It is important to have reservations, which we had.   There was an Indian couple sitting at the table next to us, and even though I have had Indian food in London, where it is the national dish, we watched what they were eating and at least for one dish, we said \"we'll have what that is.\" Good thing because as we were leaving, we found out that the place is their \"family restaurant.\" I would venture to guess that translates as they owned the place.  Like spicy? The lamb vindaloo was three alarm in my mouth and very good. Glad we had a couple of orders of naan to cool off. Don't drink water with a mouth fire, tap it down with naan! I also had spoonfuls of some other great dishes and tried to get close to the names on my photos. Next time, I am definitely taking a photo of the menu.  I also had a few bites of two of the desserts, the mango kulfi and the kala jamun, which also cooled down my mouth and were excellent."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem over by PV Mall. Highly recommend trying this place out if you love Indian food or want to be adventurous and try something new. They have this great platter called \"Tour of India\" that allows you try out different dishes from various parts of India. The concept is really cool and also helps those of us who are indecisive when it comes to making a decision on what to eat, especially when there are so many great options! I love that they are able to accommodate those of use with food allergies. They have a lot of gluten free and vegetarian options. Check out my full review on my blog: http://www.adventuresofahungrylatina.com/marigold-maison-indian-food-phoenix/"}
{"text":"Love this place. When I need my Indian food fix, this is where I go. Great location, too. Right by my house! I went in on a busy night and it took a little time for someone to notice us this time, but they looked slammed. (As a restaurant owner in the Central Phoenix area, I can understand this. It happens!) They sat us shortly after and then our server suggested wine and apps. We loved everything! Get the samosa chaat and ribs! #buylocal"}
{"text":"Ok, after all the rave reviews I had to try this place. I am a world travelled foodie who likes to eat out as well as cook in. Net net, this place is not as good as it's been rated, is just 'ok' at best. It's not bad, but good, just not great. I personally didn't care for their food and will be doctoring up my leftovers. This place is best for people who are 'new' to Indian food who need something easier to start with (and help navigating thru the menu). In that respect, it's a great concept. All the best !!"}
{"text":"So happy I tried his place. I now pick up dinner Togo every weekend. Every item I try is so full of flavor, and cooked to perfection.  My favorite item is the Chicken Saag."}
{"text":"Marigold Maison is a wonderful spot for Indian food! The vibe of the restaurant is so fresh, yet their food is traditional and delicious. For appetizers we had the seated eggplant and seared tofu which were both great and came with tamarind sauce! For our main entree my family shared lentil soup, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, roti, and garlic naan! Unfortunately, all of the desserts had nuts in them so I couldn't eat anything, but the chef made an exception and made us a crepe with chocolate and berries! That was so great of him and the staff! I will definitely return and I can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food and excellent service. Everyone in the restaurant really cared about our experience. A small restaurant with a staff that cares. This is definitely a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Wow! Soooooo good! Fresh, fast, and incredibly flavorful. And a great value and happy, knowledgeable staff as well.   All around fantastic. We had the Chicken Kati Roll and the Thali Chicken Platter at lunch.   Go go go! :-)"}
{"text":"Decided at the last minute to check out Marigold Maison on Wednesday and I'm so glad we did! The restaurant is in a strip mall near Paradise Valley Mall. When you walk in, I instantly noticed a couple things, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the smells, AMAZING smells coming from the open kitchen.  We were seated right away.   We started off with the garlic naan. It was good, I mean, really good, we ended up ordering another one. Best 3 bucks you can spend!  Wife got the Chicken Tikka Masala served with Basmati rice. It was rich and the chicken was tender, I loved it, yes, I ate some of her food. Don't worry, I shared mine with her.  I got the lamb chops. They were perfectly cooked. Tender, melt in your mouth deliciousness. It came with a mango salad, full of raisins, assorted nuts, it was awesome.   So stoked that we took a little drive to this restaurant. Service was on point, super clean restaurant, appreciated seeing the manager walk the restaurant and check out the tables to make sure everyone was o.k. Super awesome service.  WE WILL BE BACK!  Oh, they have Happy Hour (food) but you have to sit at the bar or patio for it. They do offer Happy Hour (just alcohol) if you're in the dining room."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this spot for authentic Indian food. I had the Shrimp platter and it was excellent. They have spicy if you want it or mild if you're a wimp. Overall everything was fresh, service was great, and price was worth it for sure."}
{"text":"Never order take out. These people have no idea whats going on. For 75 bucks, I waited for 45 minutes in the restaurant when they told me it would take 15 minutes. Nobody acknowledged me. Terrible experience, management could care less. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I visited this fantastic restaurant this evening to share dinner with my son. Our server's name was Abe and he was fantastic! He recommended that we try some of their happy hour items like the lamb seek and samosa chat. Boy was he right they were delicious!  The manager was very friendly and stopped by several times to see how we were. I also enjoyed a glass of wine. Can you believe that they have $6 glasses of wine during happy hour? All in all we had a great time. I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Exotic and bursting with flavor. Ambiance is very nice. Tikka Marsala with chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"I love the food and used to frequent this place quite often. This all changed last Friday when I ran into the manager Steven. He turned us away due to the fact that we didn't have reservations. When I suggested that we could sit outside his response was that it was too hot. Upon telling him that we don't mind he replied that he only had one bus boy. I will never understand why Steven was so adamant about turning us away but Marigold Maison has lost a loyal customer. Steven should not deal with customers as he does not have a single customer service bone in his body."}
{"text":"Tikka Masala is some of the best I ever had !!!  The staff is attentive and the owner works alongside to make the experience even better. Love this place good vibes ."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Boxing Day lunch with Hunter at grandparent's place at this super fresh Indian place with great choices...make sure you just get their platter for lunch...it's a lot of food and get to try more things with their naan and salad and lentil soup and gulag jamun along with 2 servings of chromosomes, lamb, chicken, veggie or Vegan options...their Mango lassi is really good as well...the shrimp is huge and plump, perfectly made, the sauces of karma and masala was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"If I could have given them 10 stars I would have. This place is our regular Wednesday Night Date NIght place. They ALWAYS deliver above and beyond our expectations. We had one comment one time and they were just amazing in addressing our request.  THANKS"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  My favorite is the lunch entree where you get the silver platter with several small bowls of three different kinds of curry, rice, salad and dessert.   What a great concept!  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went very well. It was a cute place, nicely decorated. The food was very, very good. We had the lunch special -  chicken thale platter. Highly recommended that platter."}
{"text":"Food was great, portions were larger than I expected!! Overall very pleased and would definitely go back! My only complaints was the looooong wait to get our food and the service wasn't the best. It wasn't busy when we arrived at 7:55pm but the waitress seemed very frazzled. It took her a long time just to do simple task."}
{"text":"I give five stars for the freshness of the food and service. The food tastes great. The food spice was according to American standards and indian people can easily tolerate the spicy level. I will visit again to try the kabab/tandoori delicacies."}
{"text":"Marigold Maison is my girlfriend and i's absolute favorite Indian restaurant in the valley. We live very close to the PV Mall area, so we frequent as often as we can. We have tried the majority of vegetarian curries and have enjoyed all of them wholeheartedly. My girlfriend is obsessed with the classic saag paneer, and I can't get enough of the amazing kofta. The samosa and the dosas are very delicious as well! I don't think there has been a time we haven't ordered the saag or the samosa. We've also had their veg lunch special w/ 2 varying curries, rice, naan, and misc dessert. Very filling!  There is something for everyone here!   They recently expanded - lots of seating and a new fancy bar area. Unfortunately caused a spike in menu prices, but well worth the little extra $! Servers are very friendly and always accommodating to large groups.  Both of our hearts and tummys are so happy after we come here! It's so good we bring visiting family, friends, and couchsurfers here! My mouth is watering as I write this review!!   *4/5 vegetarian friendly! Tons of delicious options!"}
{"text":"Really good food.. ordered a take out so can't speak for the ambience but the dishes tasted very good.."}
{"text":"This place was everything I had hoped and more. To start, the server was friendly and fast. When ordering, the Garlic Naan and Tikki Masala are must have items. We started out with the Samosa and it was on point. The curry was good, but not great. We had Flying Horse beer and it complimented the meal.  So far, my favorite Indian food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always a delightful and delicious experience...a must try...wonderful menu and beverage choices"}
{"text":"Just had another delicious lunch here--got the Vegan thali this time.  The food here is soooo good!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the valley. The food quality is just awesome and at the same time equally good service."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review because I love Indian food, but every time after I eat here I have digestive issues. I think it's too much sodium and processed Ingredients in their food. It taste good but it comes with a high price of bloating. This last time I noticed the taste of high amounts of sodium in the meal. So if they make this correction and I dont have extreme bloating after I would then recommend it.  Less processed ingredients to make it healthier and easier to digest! It's like eating the junk food if Indian restaurants"}
{"text":"Best Indian I've had in the Valley. Restaurant is casual & not too formal looking like some Indian restaurants are or (unsuccessfully) try to be. Spice naan & garlic naan is delicious, tikka masala & Vindaloo are perfect with just the right amount of heat. Service has always been friendly & helpful. Restaurant is a little small & outdoor seating is a little tight, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious more upscale Indian cuisine. Had a shrimp dish that was fantastic - shrimp was huge and fresh! It's a little pricier than we are used to, but the quality of ingredients seemed really good.  Updating the review because we just love this place. The service is excellent. Also, the last few months I had to eat dairy and soy- free because I was nursing a baby with food sensitivities, the chef altered the dishes to accommodate my diet. How awesome is that?"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of Yelp.  Ordered the chicken Tikka masala and chicken curry... shared meal.  We also ordered chicken pakora.  Chicken pakora was delicious and the accompanying sauce was dynamite. Both entrees were fantastic!!!    Tikka masala is out of this world!!  The masala sauce is rich and delicious.  The curry was equally delicious and plentiful.  Service is excellent, attentive... but not to excess.  Highly recommend.  One appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 soft drinks.  $50 bucks.  Not cheap... very reasonable none the less!!  Try it... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Easily a 5/5. The renovation made this place perfect. The food is consistent, and much higher quality than other Indian spots in Scottsdale/Phoenix. Service has always been excellent, Gabe (I believe that's his name) at the bar is very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  Tikka masala is really good, saag is also great.   Highly recommend any of the chai/tea/lassi's as well."}
{"text":"I would give this place a \"0\". Having a bad experience once can be forgotten but if it repeats twice, Im sure Im not going here again. Food is mediocre and its a hit or miss but what takes the cherry away from the cake is the 'Service', the server took away my appetizer plate for serving the Entree while I was still eating it and the second blow for me was I asked for boxing the food, she just brought the boxes and said that you do it whereas all the other servers on the other tables were good enough for bringing the boxes and packing the food. So what i learnt is that you have to be lucky and special enough to get good service here. Never going back !!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great tasting food,  wonderful service,  friendly staff! We have been here 3 or 4 times and have tried new dishes each time, they don't disappoint! Pushpa has been our waitress on more than one occasion and she always has a smile and eager to engage with us! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ate here recently and I loved it. We had the saag peneer, garlic naan and tikka masala. The saag peneer was outstanding!! I've eaten Indian food all over the Valley and this one is the best. It was so flavorful!! I was less impressed with the tikka masala. It tasted good but was a small portion of chicken. The garlic naan was so good we ordered another. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant SE Asian cuisine well suited for American palate. The menu was well presented and provided a good selection of classic dishes.  Starter highlight is the delicious quinoa salad. Tandoor chicken hit the mark too. A little pricey for a very good and pleasant meal."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been there. I always love a good curry and this place has some delicious ones to choose from. When I visit from California I like to go here. Staff could be a little friendlier but the food is great. I highly recommend chicken tikka masala and the korma with of course garlic nann."}
{"text":"Not far off perfection! A meal fit for a king and all his minions. For starters: Masala dosa Samosa chaat Main course: Lamb vindaloo Chicken biryani hyderabadi Chaat masala Naan For dessert: Kala Jamun Mango kulfi Every dish was perfect. Could the lamb vindaloo have been a little hotter? Well, maybe if you are used to a really spicy dish. However, if you are just a recreational Indian food eater, then it was just right. The waiter was attentive and reacted speedily to every one of our requests. Awesome job, dude. The people at the next table were really helpful, allowing us to ask about the dishes they had ordered. Little did we know that they were relatives of the owner. Lucky us! The meal we ate here was a resounding success. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this location. I heard about it through social media as it has received a good reputation for great Indian cuisine. We wanted to ensure we ordered a good variety in order to get a good feel for most flavors. The food itself is a 3 out of 5. The flavors were bland, and all three entrees had a similar curry base. If I was doing a blind test they would all taste the same to me. The rice was not fluffy and stuck together in large chunks. You can not choose spice levels. The dosa/crepe was not crispy like it should be, very soggy. I have had better Indian food in the valley this place isn't worth the hype. As far as service, I would rate it a 0 out of 5. I had reservations and two parties without one got seated before ours. The server forgot to give us plates, forgot to bring one of the drink orders, and forgot to bring out the appetizer. Several items we inquired about, he said were no longer on the menu?! What?! Was unapologetic and careless. I drove far to visit this location but definitely will not be planning a trip back. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the ratings so many have given.....  VERY good Indian food even if you are not a big Indian food person. I like Strong flavors and these did not disappoint, and yet were not that 'spicy'.  My better half who likes things much LESS spicy thought it was wonderful also.....   Will be back to try something different soon!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.   Food was good not great.  Service was mediocre too  They had five specialty drinks on the menu out of two of them.....they carry two Indian beers out of one of them?   Waitress says ( who we were told was chefs wife) yes Indian beer is hard to get???? So then why carry it on the menu if you can't get?  Our dinner was delivered to the wrong table... we had to ask for the spicy sauce we were told about at the time of ordering.   She was just not very attentive  No repeat visit here"}
{"text":"Oh my!! Really wonderful food. Some of the most attentive servers around. Smells wonderful as you enter. Lamb korma is incredible. Order family style and share. Indian beer available, good wine list- a bit pricey. If you want to secure a seat call for reservations as seating is slim esp. During summer when outdoor seating is not an option"}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant. We are so lucky to live so close. The food is great quality. The spice level is amazing. Everything we have tried has come out wonderfully. We like to order a dish and have them add in the mixed vegetables. My only complaint would be that sometimes the to-go orders get slightly messed up, but it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"I do not have a whole lot of experience eating Indian food however tonight's dishes chosen at Marigold Maison must set a new standard in terms of quality, depth and complexity of flavors.  We ordered the seared eggplant and butter shrimp as appetizers and they were both incredible. The seared eggplant was like candy it was so good and melt in your mouth! The butter shrimp was succulent accompanied by its chipotle cream sauce.  As entree, we ordered the spicy chicken korma and it was delightful. Our server Abraham brought us three different kinds of chutneys which were a nice finishing touch.  The service was spot on and very attentive. Thank you Abraham and the chefs who prepared this most delicious memorable meal ! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in town. The service is awesome but the food here is amazing! My wife gets the Tikka masala chicken while I get the chicken mikhani! The garlic naan is the best I've experienced! Please try...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered the mango salad, saag spinach with lamb, chicken curry, eggplant bharta and some garlic naan. Everything was delicious, but the naan was a little too spongy. To be fair, we ordered it to go, and the naan was reheated! All things considered I will order this again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't left a review yet.  This place is LEGIT! Best Indian food in Arizona.  Usually Indian kitchens are not the cleanest and some concern what's going on \"back there\".  These guys have an open kitchen so you can see your food being prepared. The food is always fresh and so flavorful. Usually Indian food doesn't sit well with my stomach but this food I can all the time.  We eat marigolds on average at least once or twice a week for lunch. So sad we are moving away since we will miss Marigolds. Super friendly staff and a very organized restaurant operation they are running here."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is such a great value. This gem of restaurant is hip with a cool vibe. It offers excellent service and as a Vegan I was able to find ample items to indulge in! Plenty of spice and variety"}
{"text":"I DREAM about their Chicken Tikka Masala! I add vegetables which is extra but well worth it. We were dying for some last night, and got caught up at Best Buy waaaay too long. We came running into Marigold 25 minutes to closing and they were gracious night to serve us.  It was greatly appreciated and is still amazing next day as leftovers !"}
{"text":"Our first experience with  Indian food and it was Awesome. The server was knowledgeable and the ambiance was appropriate. The food was flavorful and the depth of the textures makes me wish I could have spent all day eating there. This is a fantastic experience and I will not only return, but I will be sure to bring others too!"}
{"text":"First review on Yelp!  I've been here a few times since it opened and I absolutely loved the place, food and service. The decor, the music and the food is something I really connect to and hence the rating. The chicken Thali is what I've ordered when I've been here. They give you a paapad, 2 curries, one naan, a small bowl of rice and a sweet. I love the fact that the quantity fills me just about right and I leave feeling not heavy but content. The first time I ordered the Thali, the entrees (curries) were fantastic and the second time, one of them was alright. I will be visiting this place again and recommend it to friends who like Indian food."}
{"text":"I got some takeout here. Chicken tikka masala, garlic naan,  and it came with rice. I was happy enough with the chicken tikka masala and the naan, but I found the rice to be a bit dry and not particularly great.   If I could give them 3 1/2 stars I think that would be more accurate.   It looked like a cute place, but I prefer others."}
{"text":"Love love this place i have to say best best Indian food in the valley!! They have a platter that has a little of everything amazing! There alcohol choices aren't the biggest but the food!! The garlic nan was one of my favorite!!! Please go try it"}
{"text":"Seriously good indian food in valley. I love the lunch menu (Thali's) :)"}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for 5 years and have not been able to find a truly great Indian restaurant until now. It has been disappointing because I so love the flavors, textures, and smells of Indian cuisine.  I'm by no means an Indian cuisine expert. I know what I like. I liked Marigold Maison because of:  1) the smell when we walked in 2) the naan. Crispy on the outside, tender and chewy in the inside. Much of the naan I've sampled in Phoenix has disappointed. This naan was . 3) the chicken tikka masala was delicious. Velvety, rich sauce with proper spices and flavor. The chicken itself was moist and tender.  We also had a lamb saag dish that wasn't as good as I've had before. The saag ended up tasting almost a tad bitter. Flavor just wasn't as developed as other places I've tried."}
{"text":"Seriously cool place! Love the bar with a garage door to the patio, very modern! And the food: the Tikki Marsala was AMAZING (really everything we tried) and Abraham was the best. Some of the best Indian food I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant that I have found in Phoenix. I go out of my way to go here. If you like Indian food, skip the other places and go here."}
{"text":"Stars for the service and ambience. Food is no where near to authentic Indian.   Very expensive for such bland food. We ordered chicken curry, chicken biriyani and malai kofta, everything sucked big time.   Chicken curry - bland, no where close to authentic Indian curry.   \"South Indian\" biriyani - I'm from the southern India and a  Hyderabadi myself and I guarantee that the biriyani made here is not southern at all. I don't even know if any part of India makes biriyani like this.   Malai kofta and naan (garlic and chili) - expensive!!!! Dry naan. Chill naan just has chilli powder- it is supposed to have cut green chilies!! Kofta should be rich and creamy. This is nothing of that sort.   Overall - So many better restaurants with lower prices and with soooo much better food. If you want authentic food, never go here."}
{"text":"I guess my wife and I fall within the category of the \"American\" \"White people\" whom Zack F. disparages in his review, but we eat a lot of Indian food and we think Marigold Mansion is excellent.  We had the Lamb Saag and the Chicken Tikka Masala (which incidentally is not an Indian dish but one allegedly created in Scotland of all places!!), and they were excellent.  Each of them had a very slightly different taste (the Masala had a nice light sweetness and the Saag had a real taste of spinach), but we really liked them.    We prefer food that is flavorful rather than just fiery hot, and Marigold Maison's mild version was perfect.  You could taste the flavors while still getting some kick to keep it interesting.  I agree with some of the other commentators that the prices seem slightly higher than some others, particularly given the non-fancy ambiance, but the portions are very generous.  We had plenty to take home and enjoy the next day.  Also, the staff was friendly and attentive (although we were there on a night that wasn't very busy due to the rain - yes it rains in Phoenix).  We liked it enough to buy a gift certificate, so we will be going back."}
{"text":"Taste is okay.. Not real Indian flavor and the quantity served is less... Not worth it..."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and then forgotten. No menus no drink order for 10 min. Wine glass on table still had red wine in it. Gross!  We requested menus and watched them be placed on empty tables.  So we got up and left."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's nice to have an authentic Indian restaurant so close. It's also great if you need vegan of vegetarian options! They are very accommodating and the restaurant has a very comfortable and friendly vibe! Go early because they can run out of things, especially dessert! I love the garlic naan, black bean dashi, and chicken Tika Marsala! My boyfriend likes the curry to, not my favorite but it's because I am spoiled with the Jamaican style curry! Definitely a great place for a good bite to eat and they are very fair priced!"}
{"text":"Hands-down, this place is awesome. Great selection, fresh, great service, great ambience, great quality, great quantity, etc. Despite one problem, this place is so good I still give it 5 stars. My only complaint is the $10 bottle of water (from my understanding that's all they offered too)."}
{"text":"I would love for this place to be a go-to Indian place for me, but unfortunately I have to pass. I really, really love the idea and I love its intimate size, but it just seems to be a little too impressed with itself.  Firstly, the prices are too high. I know you're doing \"something new and funsion-y\" with Indian food, but please. $20 for a dish just because it has fish? It certainly doesn't warrant that, nor do the other dishes whose prices increase as you add meat selections like chicken, etc.  The last time I was here my husband and I ordered an eggplant dish and the chicken tikka masala.  I must say the chicken tikka sauce's flavor was OUTSTANDING. Definitely the best I've tasted - very robust and wonderful.   The eggplant however, was terribly overpowered by chipotle. Yuck. I've not had those two paired together and I think there's a reason for that. Eggplant is so delicate and its flavor is best supported by the herbs and spices in the dish so its butteriness can be savored - not drowned out by an overly bold spice. Not a well constructed dish at all.  Also, both dishes were supposed to be mildly spiced. Our server asked for the spice level, we told her mild (husband doesn't do well with too much spice), and the food came out *at least* medium spiced or hotter. The eggplant was so spicy we had to send it back. My guess is that the chipotle had a lot to do with that, as its inherent heat certainly added to the additional spice used to give the spice gradient to the dishes. Again - chipotle - BAD IDEA.  The service that night also was not up to par and certainly didn't support the $46 bill we had at the end. The server *meandered* over to our table after we'd been sitting there for a little too long and kind of looked at us askance WAITING for us to tell her what we wanted. Like she couldn't be bothered too much to let more than just a few words out of her mouth. It was very strange. And the restaurant was NOT busy; no one was in the weeds.  All in all, I'm not really impressed enough to make this a regular place. For the prices I expect excellent professional service, well-crafted dishes, and chefs that understand mild, medium, and hot as it relates to Indian food."}
{"text":"We had dinner with two friends last Friday evening.  The food was very good.  It was a little pricy, but I would go there again.  We all liked what we had and the service was good.  We had an incident which I think shows the character of the staff.  I had asked for a container to take some food home.  Unfortunately, the waiter took the food before we were able to put it into the container.  We informed the waiter and the manager came over.  Both appologized for the mistake.  Then the manager said they were making a fresh batch and would give us some.  We waited (no long and we were talking anyway).  He basically gave a full serving.  He was also very friendly.  Service like that is simply outstanding.  While, I rarely give five stars, I thought between the food and the service, they deserve it.  I would definitely recommend Marigold Maison."}
{"text":"I love Indian food. There, I said it. The problem? There just aren't that many great places here in Phoenix to get it. So when I saw a new Indian place open and get such rave reviews, I was excited. My mom and I decided to meet here for lunch last week. This place was a little hard to find, but it is on the NE corner of Tatum and Cactus (I went to like every other shopping center first... *palm to forehead*) and it faces cactus (by the Olive Garden sort of). When we entered, my first thought was, oh cute... my second thought was... this place is owned by Roka Akor's restaurant group... that's...weird. Anyway, the owner greeted us and that is when things started to get weird. The owner is a talker... he said so himself... and the things he talked about were a little off putting for a restaurant owner... he talked about politics... people walking by the restaurant.... his old chef who stole from him.... karma...you name the awkward conversation topic to have with a stranger, he probably talked about it. I would say this isn't advisable for a restaurant owner... it's not like we came here to hang out with him, we came here to eat.   Speaking of eating, my mom and I shared a Thali and an order of samosas. I was excited they had Thalis (not many places that I've been here do). The thali is like going to an Indian buffet when you are on a serious diet... you get to taste many items, but just a small amount of each. The Thali consists of 3 'main' dishes - you pick the protein for 2 of them and the third is a mixed veggie curry. They allowed us to mix the lamb vindaloo with the chicken masala (after a little nudging from me and agreeing to pay the higher price - 14$). The lamb was very good, tender, just the right amount of spice. The chicken was also tender, but kind of bland for Indian food.... I guess at dinner you can choose your spice level, but not the case at lunch. The veggies were alright... nothing great, nothing bad. It also came with salad (meh.. salad is salad), two scrawny pieces of plain naan (again... nothing special), rice, and a fried dough ball soaked in sweet syrup (I was kind of sad since reports on here said it used to come with rice pudding... I love rice pudding, the dough ball is just ok). The real star of our meal were the samosas... these things were hot, crispy, and well seasoned.    Will I be back? Eh, maybe if I were in the area, my mom really enjoyed it, but overall I thought it was just ok and far more expensive (and less delicious) than some of the lunch buffets out there."}
{"text":"For my wife's birthday the go to is Indian food.  We were visiting my mother in Scottsdale and on the hunt for a new restaurant as the last one we tried was  sub par at best.  After reading the reviews we decided to give Marigold a try.  Ordering online through Yelp and eat 24 was a snap.  The place was very busy but when I walked in the door I was met with those all familiar delicious smells of a good meal to come.  We were not disappointed the portions were good and delicious.  My wife is a vegetarian and when she says the Dal is really good you can take that to the bank.  My mother was happy and now has her go to restaurant and is looking forward to going there with her friends.  Hint: Probably a good idea to make a reservation."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and the food was excellent! We both ordered the lunch platters. what a great variety of flavors. The waiter was very nice and gave a nice explanation of the menu. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I feel like Marigold Maison could easily be elevated one star, if the rice weren't so hard. It's not at all fluffy and soft enough to go well with the saucy curries. Other than that and the dry (white meat) chicken in some of the dishes, I do like this place for the chicken saag, naan and the thali at lunch time... just not the rice."}
{"text":"I have now dined here 4 times so I feel qualified to give an expert review. Hands down the best indian I've had in the valley. I absolutely love the Flavors. We ask for ours extra spicy but they still make a great mild for all of the wimps out there. What I like most is the meat in each dish is quality.   Service is excellent they really take care of you while you are here and every single person we've had is very friendly and accommodating.   I also like that the restaurant feels clean and fresh. No dark corner booths with ripped vinyl in sight.   My only complaint is they are closed next week for their expansion. Congrats to them for being successful but how are we supposed to survive without it for a whole week? I guess we will manage. Can't wait to see it when it's finished."}
{"text":"Pushpa! Pushpa! Pushpa! Super cute Indian auntie!! Her husband is the chef and they are SO passionate about their food. They provided a wonderful and authentic mom and pop feel.  Being new to Indian food, she was amazing at suggesting wonderful dishes!!  I went in with a friend a couple weeks ago and Chef Sunil came to the table, greeted us and gave us a very warm welcome.  Pushpa made wonderful food suggestions as well as some great wine pairings. We ordered a feast, including gol guppa, mango salad, chicken tikka masala, lamb chops, lamb saag and garlic naan.  I've been here a couple more times since then and their wild-caught salmon tikka masala and masala dosa (Indian crepes) are to die for. Chef Sunil mentioned they are the hardest thing on their menu to make, but he loves sharing a piece of his culture. I've also stopped by for happy hour and they have an AMAZING happy hour. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Delicious, sumptuous, fresh flavored....can't go wrong here. Price is right too. Luved it!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while visiting Phoenix. Jeffrey was great, we got seated right away, and had paneer pakora appetizers. The chicken thali plate was delicious and filling for lunch. Service was great and the restaurant was really nice!"}
{"text":"You want to make reservations if going on a Friday or Saturday night.   The food is pricey.  The ambience is pleasant.   I ordered the Malai Kofta. The spice is a bit bland. The dumplings were pretty tasty, even if the sp car is bland.   Another person in my party Tandori Sampler. It was also bland and expensive   The third person ordered the Makhana. This person likes bland food much more than the rest of the party and raved about it.   We had garlic naan and paneer naan and a veggie Samosa. The best part of the dinner was the naan. But I prefer Indian restaurants that keep the naan coming with meals.   It isn't bad to eat here considering you are in PV, and there really isn't much culture there. No shortage of upper middle class white people lining up to eat here."}
{"text":"We were really excited for our date night at Marigold Maison as several friends raved about the restaurant and the food and we were celebrating a special occasion. Reading reviews we saw the space was small and made a reservation in advance for Friday evening. When we arrived the place was swamped and the servers seemed really overwhelmed. After waiting a few minutes a table was set for us and we were excited to check out the menu.  We ordered popadums for an appetizer and two curry dishes to share for the entree. The popadums arrived and our server said she would be right back with the sauces. The sauces never arrived. We snacked patiently on the bread while waiting for the sauces as we watched the servers rush between tables and patrons line up outside waiting. Both tables on either side of us were visibly annoyed as they were waiting for their checks. Finally they got the attention of what looked to be a front of house manager and he checked them out. It wasn't until our main dishes arrived that the server noticed the sauces never came - she said she asked someone else to get them for us, but he forgot.  At that point the appetizer was a bust as we were ready for the entrees - lamb saag and chicken curry. We liked the saag, but the chicken in the curry was dry. My husband was surprised there was only one Indian beer on the menu - as a restaurant that claims it is a \"fine indian experience\", it seemed less authentic.  All in all, I have to say our experience was just \"meh\". The food was okay but not great, we have had better from other places in the valley. The service fell short and the team knew it. I'm empathetic, as I was a server and can understand how exhausting and stressful it is when a place is busy like that - but unfortunately those feelings transfer to the patrons.  We gave it a shot, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Coming from surrey (suburb of Vancouver bc) I know good East Indian food. This place is very very good! Up to standard in my books. Last time we ate here we got take out but we decided to eat in this time. We didn't have to wait for a table but it was very busy which was a good sign. Food came out fast and hot. It was fun to see our food being prepared in non-enclosed kitchen. I would have given the place 5 starts but for me the prices were on the high side from what I am used to paying for Indian food (I think the prices are high because it's in paradise valley). I also think you get a larger portion for take out. Will order again but will be take out this time."}
{"text":"We stopped in when they first opened near PV Mall, just east on Cactus Rd. It was kind of hidden in that strip mall, so if you blinked you could miss it. It does face south to Cactus and  is on the north side of the street w/ good signage. Always follow your nose when looking for Indian food. It's pretty much unmatched when it comes to the senses, both olfactory and taste. We had a rushed lunch and ordered a side of samosas These were larger and golden brown and just right when it comes to crispy than most other places offer up. The dips of tamarind sauce and mint chutney were perfect and complimented them for that heightened duo of perfection. The Chicken tikka masala and basmati rice was simply superb as was the lamb curry. Too bad they didn't serve masala dosa at the time. I'm not sure if they added that to the menu but it's a hallmark of South Indian food which probably is why they didn't offer it. This restaurant serves primarily North Indian cuisine as far as I know, but it's really authentic and we enjoyed the whole ambience and experience. Good hosts and the chef came out to chat (chaat) w/ us wanting to know how we liked everything. We gave him the thumbs up which he obviously liked. I never hold back on suggestions if asked, and he did and listened carefully! Yes I recommend it to anyone who relishes Indian fare and to newbies as well. Not too spicy! That seems to be an issue with people not familiar with Indian cuisine. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now.  The first time was maybe a year ago and good. This most recent visit since their expansion was disappointing.  The service started off very friendly, but then became inattentive and almost annoyed - never filling water glasses; long random times between food - even though we asked to not delay as we had a young one with us.   I've had Indian food in many cities to compare.  This food was relatively bland.  The dosa was like a soft pancake stuffed with potatoes - not the thin crispy version that is more typical.  Lassi was OK, but only available in  mango version.   The saag paneer was relatively good. The chicken tikka masala was OK, but surprisingly little chicken for a $16 dish.   Wine selection was good. Overall, food is OK, jut not quite authentic Indian.  I would call this Indian-style.  There are not many Indian restaurants in the area.   So, this place is good for a nice meal if you're in no rush and don't mind getting Phoenix version of Indian.   The pricing is expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible Indian food.  Definitely recommend the masala dosa, which is slightly cooler than most of the other spicy food and is good to have around to temper your mouth-fire.  We also had the samosa chaat, lamb vindaloo (FIRE!!!), chicken biryani hyderabadi, and chaat masala.  Make sure you order naan - you'll need it to sop up the awesome curry sauces and to put on your burning tongue like an ice-pack.  For dessert, we had the kala jamun and mango kulfi, both of which were icy in sensation and great after the burning meal.  Song of Fire and Ice, anyone?  They also serve cocktails, which will shore up your courage and make it so you're slightly less apprehensive about eating what you know is going to be authentic Indian spiciness.  I'm not even sure of the ingredients of half of what we ate, but it was all delicious, and we devoured it.  I recommend coming here with friends as you can order family-style and try even more dishes.   This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker and I loved the food here!  Very delicious.  Service was amazing.  The tandoori chicken was superb!  My son couldn't hang with his vindaloo veggie dish because it was too spicy for his taste however, they did warn him .  We will be back when visiting Arizona!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service is sooooooo bad !!!!!! The owner has got to hire more staff OMG!!!! It is to busy and they can't fill the orders. You just sit and sit and sit. We came 8 months ago and the same thing happened and now we give it another chance and it's still run horribly. Please fix this the food is so good."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour to try this place for the first time . Let me tell you this place is really delicious. We had the chicken patter highly recommended. Are server Gina was really awesome,very nice .i will defiantly be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I came to marigold Maison for some light happy hour specials and was very pleased with the price and quality. I tried the chicken tikka, samosa, and garlic naan. Everything was excellent except the naan. I've had their naan before and enjoyed it, but this batch was dry and covered in way too much garlic! We sat at the bar and we're served by a very friendly and professional bartender."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants in the valley.  I love the chicken and lamb kati rolls and the chicken and lamb tali.  Always have great service."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant mainly because of the Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.   Our server - David was excellent,  he recommended and told us what were the popular dishes since this was our first time having Indian Food.   We started with the Masala Dosa, a potato and onion crepe which looked like a huge burrito which came with 2 different sauces which was exceptional. Also got the Gol  Guppa which was a whole wheat puff that you break a hole to stuff which was fun and tasty.   We ordered the following entrees - Lamb Chops, Tandoori Salmon and Classic Curry Chicken which all were excellent.   We tried the Garlic Naan and the Hot Chai Tea.  We were asked about dessert but we were so stuffed we could not eat another bite.  Was a great new adventure and everything was perfect.   Will recommend this restaurant and also be back."}
{"text":"I only went there to get a takeout but wow my food tasted sooogod!! It's the best Indian food I've eaten so far! Will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Marigold Madison is probably my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area. The lunch thali platters are amazing! Each one comes with a bread, thin crackers, and different assortments of small dishes such as lentil soup, curry, salad, chickpeas, and rice pudding. I've had both the vegetable (which comes with paneer instead of meat) and the chicken thali platters. I highly recommend this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out based on some pictures they posted online. They looked that good.  And it didn't disappoint. I'm not some Indian cuisine expert, but they had things in the menu that I don't see at other places, and it was fun to try them out.   Out of 4 things we ordered, I loved 3 but one was just blah.  I'd call that a success.  The staff was very pleasant and explained items on the menu, and the price was good.   Too bad it's about 40 miles from my house, but if I'm ever on this side of town, I'll go again."}
