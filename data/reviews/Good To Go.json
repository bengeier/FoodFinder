{"text":"Anna take pride in producing quality and healthy options for her customers.  The juice fast that she cold pressed to order is a life changer.  Her line of Anna in the raw products are a treat if you are trying to eat healthy on the go!"}
{"text":"Anna knows what she's doing and is a staple in the IMG Building.  Let's get to the point. If you are looking for healthy and homemade this is where you should go. Everything is reasonable and delicious. The soups are made from scratch and the sandwiches and wraps are delicious! Every day there are different specials and I'm guilty of sometimes just running over for coffee since she has a flavored brew every day. Graham Cracker and Pumpkin Pie this time of year make me swoon.   You are greeted with a smile and leave with a delicious lunch (or breakfast) to fill your belly. Don't miss out on this little gem! Oh! And follow her on Twitter for daily specials-always something new and unique to look forward to. Thanks Anna!"}
{"text":"Healthy fresh affordable lunch options. Love the tuna wrap and yogurt side option. Anna is awesome."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I heard about this place on a recent Yelp Review of the Day, or I would never have known it was here! Checked it out today for lunch with a vegetarian friend, and we both loved it!  The menu had a perfect variety of mostly vegetarian/vegan sandwiches and salads, with a few non-vegetarian, but still health-conscious, items. The black bean burrito that I ordered was awesome and delicious and healthful. It was big and filling, like 70% the size of a Chipotle burrito, with a bag of those really good \"Dirty Potato Chips\", for $7.   We saw a guy getting a salad as we were leaving, and it was humongous and beautiful.... will definitely be ordering that next time!"}
{"text":"How could you not go wrong.. with Anna's fabulous believe in healthy food for her customers and ever present happiness. I love everything she does with her menu. She offers secret passwords for daily discounts and lives life with  fun and love of family. The decor is filled with some very nice local sports legends and her family in a bright and cheerful setting."}
