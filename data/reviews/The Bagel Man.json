{"text":"Best tasting bagels in Arizona and of anywhere that I have tried in the world.  The owner makes you feel like family.  My son loves to go too.  
My staple - bagel breakfast sandwich with lox."}
{"text":"Cozy soup Nazi vibe in effect, no frills but best bagels in town. Ordered coffee to go w/ honey wheat Bfast bagel eggs,cheese,sausage. Best 5$ investment. 

I was curious & asked the guy @the counter \"what type of sausage\" was included in the bagel & received very informative \"sausage\" answer...  Classic."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, I got two of the sliced lox ones and I was talking to the owner. He said I will love it and that I will come back again, he's right I will 100% be back . It's hard to find bagel places that have lox in Arizona and I'm glad I found this place"}
{"text":"Like whoa.  Best bagels in Arizona.  No question.

Bagels are probably my favorite food.  I take them very seriously.  But I don't eat them very often because most bagels in the Phoenix area are so mediocre it's just not worth it.

Bagel Man bagels are incredible.  We went there on Saturday to pick up a dozen and the everything bagels had just come out of the oven.  OMG.  Fresh, piping hot, soft, flavorful - PERFECT.  And the veggie cream cheese is also amazing.

I wish we lived closer but then I might eat 5 bagels a day.  Maybe it's good we're a few miles away.  

Can't wait to go back.  Oh and I love The Bagel Man himself - he's legit."}
{"text":"Best bagel I've had in AZ! With fresh, yummy jalepeno cream cheese. Just what I was looking for!"}
{"text":"Try \"The Boss\" it is so nice on a warm summer day. Fresh mozzarella with Roasted red pepper and olive oil. Excellent sandwich! Finally a great family owned bagel shop in the southeast valley!"}
{"text":"This place has ruined bagels for me for the rest of my life. They set the bar pretty freakin high! It's a pretty small establishment with limited seating, I recommend taking it to-go. Service is good and the owner is friendly. There have been times that certain bagel flavors have sold out due to high demand, but within 15-30 minutes they usually have another batch made if youre picky."}
{"text":"Blueberry Bagel is fresh yummy bagel heaven. Thanks Bagel man."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall. Wonderful fresh New York style breakfast bagels. If it were closer I would probably go every single morning"}
{"text":"Amazing bagels made for you by amazing employees. They are so quick and very friendly. Great customer service!! They even allow call ahead pick up. I gave 4 stars only because they are not open Monday's though and the place is a little small so when there is a line you feel crunched or in the way of everyone else. Did I mention the bagels are amazing?"}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times now, and continue to fall in love every time.

The bagels are the best we've ever had, and are paired with amazing meats and cheeses.

I've never had a bagel in New York, but I'm hopeful that this is what everybody is talking about. It's certainly what we're talking about!"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh bagels.  Nice people too.  Plan to sit outside- the inside is tight and functional only.  You will appreciate the good food, not the atmosphere."}
{"text":"There is no better place for a bagel in this dry desert town than The Bagel Man.  You can close your eyes and smell the traffic out on the NYC street.  It's a little musty and stuffy from the bagel steam (or the swamp cooler).  You hear the friendliness of the Bagel Man himself, welcoming you in and wishing you well on your way.  And then you taste the warm, crust and soft insider of a fantastic bagel and cream cheese.   Perfection."}
{"text":"Great service, great taste and perfect product...try a Bialy they are the best!"}
{"text":"The best in town! Nice big serving of tasty lox, capers, tomato, cream cheese.....wonderful! The only place I will go for my bagels. Super friendly people w great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Have fun selecting your favorite flavors knowing that The Bagel Man makes bagels that are better than you will find elsewhere around town.  This makes all the difference.  I have had more fancy styles on the east coast, but I haven't had better bagels.  Try the olive spread."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Bagels I have EVER had!  LOVE-LOVE-LOVE this  place, only wish they were closer to my house!"}
{"text":"You move from NY and miss the bagels..of all things. 
Best bagels in Arizona. Equally as good as, if not better than, a lot of NY bagel places. Sometimes there are no bagels left by 11 am, but it seems like lately they have been stocked if I get there around that time. Everything is good; nothing is bad. I usually get tuna. Really good cream cheese, too. Everything I have ever gotten there has been good. Bagels freeze well, too.
Owner is nice and will always say hi and ask about family. Some of the newer guys working there are...new....let's say.
Go early and often!"}
{"text":"The Bagel Man has the best everything bagels I have ever eaten.  I go there for lunch a couple times a week.  I enjoy the Boar's Head deli meats as well.  Cal is there every day and always greets me with a smile and knows exactly what I like.  Glad to see that since it has only been open a few months that he always has customers in there.  I love to see the community supporting the small businesses in the area."}
{"text":"The best bagels in AZ. My favorite is the Loks bagel minus the onions on a toasted everything bagel. Cal and his cree have this down perfectly."}
{"text":"Nice folks working the lunch shift and keeping on top of everything, including keeping the place clean. 

The bagels had a nice crust and flavor, but it feels like they might not have adjusted the recipe for warmer summer temps yet. The bagels we got were on the pillowy side, maybe having had too much rise. I'd like more chew and density from a place with NYC pedigree."}
{"text":"I've always loved bagel sandwiches for breakfast and am so glad I found this place on Yelp! I've been to The Bagel Man twice now for a bacon, egg, and cheese on everything and both times it was excellent! I just moved to Tempe a month ago, but don't think I'll even bother trying other bagel shops. This one already has my heart with its bagel perfection and timely / friendly service."}
{"text":"Delicious bagel sandwiches.  They do not cut corners and give you proper amount of each topping."}
{"text":"I love this place,  I feel like I'm back east walking into a bagel shop... This is the real deal. For all the people that think Einsteins Bagels are good... Come experience what a real bagel and bagel shop is... and you NEVER toast a bagel!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I live just down the street to I'm typically here every weekend. I love their breakfast sandwiches. My boyfriend & I have breakfast here or take it to go. The boys are always nice & very fast in making your food. I absolutely do recommend."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!  ...especially if you're used to east coast bagels!   Where else can you get 2 bacon egg and cheese breakfast bagel sandwiches plus a large drink big enough for two and all for $9!!  Plus they use Boar's Head bacon there...so it's not that thin nasty bacon you find elsewhere. Their everything bagels are the best in town. I highly recommend this place and it's worth waiting if there's a line. The owner and workers are all friendly, which makes for a good atmosphere.  My only complaint is that they need more tables ...maybe they should buy the sub shop next to them and expand."}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of bagels since I'm used to the stored bought kind like Sarah Lee and Costco brand.  I think in general bagels are thick and doughy.   Starbucks, Einstein bagels are the same in my opinion.  However I found bagel man on yelp as I was looking for a breakfast joint.  I'll have to admit The bagels are the best in town as they are made fresh everyday.  I had the lox onion bagel with cream cheese scallions and my husband had the works on a garlic bagel.   That's was the beginning of my bagel addiction.  I come atleast twice a week and get the breakfast bagel that comes with bacon, egg and cheese.  They have a variety of bagels to choose from and I've had a few and they all taste great.  Go get yours today!"}
{"text":"Note to self:  Don't look at Bagel Man on Yelp when you're hungry.

First tried the Bagel Man after a coworker brought in bagels one morning and I demanded to know where these heavenly bagels were prepared.  He pointed me to The Bagel Man, which happens to be close to my house.

I drug my husband here one Saturday morning for bagel sandwiches.  We walked out with a ham, egg and cheese everything bagel and a sausage egg and cheese everything bagel.  We ordered a couple of extra bagels to go as well and enjoyed them at home.

The restaurant itself is tiny, packed, and hot on a Saturday morning, but the service was quick and the bagels are worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't normally try little places like this, but I'm so glad I did (thanks to the other reviews on here)! It was a small little shop in a shopping plaza, with several two-person tables. As I was waiting, several other obviously regular customers came in, and the owner automatically knew what each of them wanted. Very friendly. I got a bacon, egg, and cheese everything bagel, and my two small kids shared a blueberry bagel with cream cheese. I tried a bite of theirs, and it was really good...the cream cheese was clearly handmade and delicious. My bagel was also absolutely amazing. They put plenty of each food on it, and good quality ingredients. The bagel itself was delicious and a perfect texture. Around $6 for the two bagels. Any time we are in Phoenix again, we will definitely be going here."}
{"text":"One of the best bagels and spread I've ever had. The salmon spread had chunks of salmon in it and was delicious. Coffee cake is excellent as well. Coffee was ok, but the bagel made up for it. I'll be back when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just off the boat from NYC looking for a good bagel saw reviews thought I would give it a try they are ok nothing special about it maybe its the best in the area like I said just off the boat but not worth my 40 min round trip drive will keep looking"}
{"text":"Best bagels I've ever had!  Made the right way with a huge selection of cream cheeses and sandwiches!  Loved it!!  My husband had the bagel and lox and it was perfectly prepared with red onion and capers."}
{"text":"I picked up a bakers dozen for the coworkers today, we are all in agreement, the best bagels around! These have the perfect chewy crust and soft fluffy center. Very nice selections of spreads as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for my first bagel from The Bagel Man...WOW! I'm confident in saying this was the best bagel I've ever had. I had the everything bagel, toasted, with their scallion cream cheese on the side. First of all, they put toppings on both sides of the bagel, which is awesome! No more debating which half of the bagel to eat first (I'm looking at you, Einsteins everything bagel!) Second, the bagel was perfectly baked, slightly crunchy outside, moist and chewy inside. And the scallion cream cheese was the icing in the delicious bagel cake. I also spoke to the extremely friendly owner, and I'm so glad to hear that business is going well for him. The only trouble with this place is it's very close to my office, and I'm afraid of all the money I'm going to be spending here!"}
{"text":"There is no better bagel place! Kal knows what he is doing and there is no comparison with the other places around. The only time I go to another bagel place is on Monday when they are closed!"}
{"text":"First time here last Saturday, got the egg, ham and cheese on a jalapeño bagel with cream cheese. It's a really good value and the bagel was one of the best I've had. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR my favorite place for breakfast. I wish I was exaggerating. My boyfriend and I go here several times a week. Great bagels. Quick service. Wonderful people. They are always so friendly and it is just a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"We ordered a breakfast sandwich (egg and cheese), The Sexy, and one with plain cream cheese. We only tried the jalapeno bagel for all three. Very impressed. The bagels were soft and warm and the perfect density. 

There was a line almost out the door around 11am on a Saturday morning. The line went very fast and we were eating in no time. 

Bagel was still good the next day after being refrigerated. 

Highly recommend if you love mom and pop shops."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I don't know that I have ever had a truly authentic bagel until visiting The Bagel Man. The owner, Kal, is so nice and friendly. He introduced himself to me and my husband and when I went back the next day with a friend, he remembered my name. Great service, food and the coffee is great too. I usually don't expect great coffee from the carafes but their coffee went great with my bagel breakfast sandwich. My only complaint was that it was a little hot in there, but combined with the fact that we live in Arizona and the big ovens, I'm going to have to cut them some slack. Great place and new favorite bagel spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The bagels are homemade and the owner and staff are super friendly...been going for a few years now and no other bagel compares!"}
{"text":"The bagels are great here. I usually end up getting a toasted wheat or sesame seed bagel with veggie cream cheese. The owner said he visited AZ six years ago and couldn't get a good bagel so he made it his mission to open another bagel shop (his family has one in NJ). I'm glad he did. 

Good food, good prices, good place."}
{"text":"Best Bagels in the Valley!!!  Very authentic and delicious.  The owner, Cal, is so very kind, friendly and always happy."}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning for a breakfast bagel sandwich, I found this place randomly on yelp and since it has such great reviews I thought I'd give it a try! 

It is your typical hole in the wall shop that offers up some delicious fresh bagels! I ordered the egg and lox breakfast sandwich. I ordered it on a toasted everything bagel that was absolutely fantastic with the lox, tomato and chive cream cheese! The scrambled egg was sub par but I expected it to be. The bagels are far exceeding your typical Einsteins bagel and I would recommend a stop by The Bagel Man to anyone!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bagel in Arizona.  Hands down the best bagel sandwiches in Arizona.  So fresh they make you angry at all of the time you wasted eating at Einstein's.  So reasonably priced they make you wonder why you don't come here everyday.  

Crackly crust, tender dough, toppings on both sides of the bagel.  Perfection."}
{"text":"Very, very good. 

This place could be a selling point when convincing New Yorkers to move to the Phoenix area. 

This makes my top two bagel places, the other one being an older bagel shop in NYC. I got a [fresh] everything bagel with lox spread, and it was a highlight of my day. 

The staff were very courteous and attentive, and provided excellent service.

In sum, you can keep reading Yelp reviews, or you can go and experience it for yourself. I suggest the latter."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bagel place!
The bagels are soooooo damn delicious. They are crispy on the outside and so chewy on the inside. They are by far much larger than other bagels from anywhere else, like Einstein Bagels. I usually need to eat 3 or 4 of Einstein Bagels to get full (and I'm a little 5'4 120lb girl), and just 1 or 2 of the Bagel Man's bagels are more than enough to fill me up.
The owner is so sweet and remembers you after you show up once. He always asks how I've been and remembers details from last time, he is so friendly. The second you walk in the door he will greet you.
As for what was said by that negative review below, that isn't true at all. The place is clean and smells wonderfully of freshly baked bagels. There are other workers who have rang me up before, and were very friendly with it.
The only thing I could find negative at all about this place was that its slightly warm inside, but that's just because they are baking bagels all day!
Every time I am in Phoenix I stop by and get some of their bagels! They are great to eat after a morning workout. Sometimes when I stop by at the end of the day, I get a couple free bagels with my order. I would definitely recommend stopping by, and trying the egg bagel especially!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Cal is very sweet and so is his staff. They make a point to ask your name and seem genuinely happy to see you. The breakfast bagels are amazing (eggs, cheese, bacon mmmmm). Unlike other bagel places, they don't use a microwave to cook your breakfast. It does get packed on the weekends and others days, they may already be out of your favorite bagel type. That to me just means I've gotta get out of bed earlier. :) We'd be here at least weekly if I said \"Yes.\" every time my 11 year old asks, \"Can we get Bagel Man?\". It takes a lot of self control to keep driving when I pass iron the way to work each day. :)"}
{"text":"Real bagels. Not rolls shaped like bagels you usually get in Arizona. I grew up in Detroit. I missed bagels from back East . . . Until the arrival of The Bagel Man. The owner has an original shop back in Jersey. That should say it all about authenticity. 

If you want a real bagel, check this place out. Never understood why people from the East love bagels?  One visit here will explain it."}
{"text":"First time here and I was greeted with smiles and warm fresh bagels.  Hole in the wall place, very small and cozy. Bagels were delicious and soft! You have to try the homemade cream cheese spread. It was amazing. I found my new bagel joint!"}
{"text":"Bagel Man's rudeness exceeds his lack of business sense.   When trying to buy 6 pumpernickel, 6 whole wheat, and some egg bagels, Bagel Man snapped \"My bagels are expensive and you will be taking them away from my other customers.\"  What's that all about?   Isn't Bagel Man in the business to make and sell bagels?  When presenting a coupon to buy a dozen and get 3 free (which we've used many times) we were told that the coupon was counterfeit and he did not want to honor it, but did so with a growl of anger.

Another problem is the inconsistency of the bagels.  Sometimes they are dry and when cut, have air holes.   Sometimes they are uneven with rather large holes and misshapen.  Sometimes they have a crusty outside like they have been egg washed.  I've actually cut one and the whole outside crust fell off, leaving very little bagel left. The place is dirty and tables and floor are speckled with crumbs. 
 
Bagel Man should be baking enough bagels to satisfy all his customers, not scold them for ordering them.  We have given up on Bagel Man."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today.  Yelp has never failed me and this was no different. The owner was super friendly and welcoming. The everything bagel with cream cheese and sliced lox was awesome.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on the hunt for a good + local bagel place..and we found this little gem yesterday!! The owner is so personable, and so is everyone who works here. Something tells me we're going to be here every weekend!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast bagel sandwich I ever had!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday breakfast around 11am. The wait was not long and the bagels we ordered were fantastic; fresh and authentic. Prices are reasonable-paid ~$16 for 3 breakfast sandwiches, a bagel w/ cream cheese, and 2 drinks. Highly recommend as an area source of nourishment!!"}
{"text":"When a New York City native tells you this is a AUTHENTIC bagel shop, you have done many things right! Love this place."}
{"text":"I got an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel.  The bagel was a bit to garlic salty for me but I'm sure most other Americans would love it.  the bagel was like a fresh baguette; crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  The simple sandwich was good but I will get a different type of bagel next time."}
{"text":"This place is fast and fairly priced. The garlic bagel I had was so fresh! I'm not going to anymore chains!"}
{"text":"I love the bagel man! Such a nice group of workers. Super fast and still friendly. Bagels are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! It was recommended by a friend. It was my first time there, I ordered the breakfast bagel with lox and tomatoes!! Dayum dayum dayum!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best bagels in Phoenix! The staff seem like great people too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my morning stop every weekday. Best bagels in town, staff is incredibly friendly and the owner loves his business. I am a regular and I can't imagine changing that habit anytime soon. My personal favorite is the salted bagel preferably right out of their ovens."}
{"text":"Outstanding bagels, great service.

A bagel joint in Phoenix deserves credit just for making actual bagels. Some of the popular spots in Phoenix -- e.g. Chompie's -- don't make real bagels. They're just \"rolls with holes\", just common bread. A bagel is distinctive in its chewy texture and unique flavor.

For reference, Einsteins and Back East Bagels will give you real bagels, far better than Chompie's. Bagel Man is better still. They don't just make real bagels -- they make good bagels. Best I've had anywhere in the Tempe, Ahwatukee, Mesa, Chandler area."}
{"text":"I just found this place and it is very good.  The cream cheese is great and the bagels are delicious."}
{"text":"What an amazing bagel! I had a ham, egg and cheese sandwich on a plain bagel and made \"nom nom nom\" sounds during every bite. I will be coming here every time I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Simply the best.  Nothing else needs to be said.  You will not be disappointed. One visit and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"The bagels were good, maybe a bit too salty that day.  The staff was nice but they all seemed to be new so the logistics were still being worked out.  Atmosphere is lacking inside or out.  Room for improvement."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is the ONLY place I will buy bagels from. When I moved from NY to AZ over a decade ago, I failed to anticipate that the every day staples of food I grew up with exist in very limited supply out here. My every-Sunday-morning-breakfast consisted of a bagel w/ cream cheese and some smoked salmon. Throw in a cup of coffee, the morning paper, and you have my perfect Sunday morning. Fast forward to me residing in AZ; where are the bagels at?! No, I don't mean rolls that are shaped like donuts (most places that sell \"bagels\" like Chompies, Back East Bagels, and other chains that don't do this food justice). I mean big, crusty on the outside, and dense soft dough on the inside bagels. Here is where The Bagel Man comes in. The taste, the texture, and the quality is the closest to anything I grew up with. All of their variety tastes good and fresh. Their staff is very friendly. If you want the best, be there at opening; but if you get there before me, save me some 'Everything', 'Sesame', and 'Onion' bagels. BTW, their smoked salmon/lox with cream cheese actually has chunks of smoked salmon in it versus the other guys who whip their cream cheese to the point that all I see is some pink in my cream cheese. Thank you, The Bagel Man for restoring my Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"A must go if  you like the small cafe style shop. Bagels are fresh in house along with the cream cheese being hand whipped. Don't forget the price,  very affordable. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best bagels I have had in AZ!  Very fresh and soft, as well as a lot of options to choose from."}
{"text":"Place is legit. Great bagles. Very reasonably priced. Long lines of course, but that just shows how good they are. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I swoon for bagels, I adore them. When the sweet scent of an everything bagel is in the air, my knees buckle. I came to The Bagel Man for the first time I could barely hold my excitement as soon as I saw that rack of bagels. I had to order an everything bagel with lox and cream cheese. I knew I had to, like it was predestined. The rest of that experience was like some sort of heroine high daze that left me craving more. A life long addiction that I'm sure I'll never shake."}
{"text":"This. Place. Was. FILTHY.  Oh my gosh.  It looked like the aftermath of a food fight - bagel chunks and crumbs all over the floor.  I won't get started on the bathroom, it was so disgusting.  

The owner, the Bagel Man himself, was too busy chatting with another employee to greet me or wait on me.  A nice lady from the kitchen had to come out and help.  Apparently though, nobody but the owner is allowed to handle the money so he finally broke off his conversation and rang up the sale.  I didn't like the way he treated the nice lady and I was troubled by the way she seemed overly deferential to him and almost frightened.  

Bagels are okay but nothing special.

Would NOT go back!  If the customer are is that dirty, what can the kitchen be like???"}
{"text":"Amazing New York style bagels. Crispy thin crust, soft chewy dough. The breakfast bagel on an everything bagel is the way to go. Friendly service. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love The Bagel Man. The owner learned my name after the third visit ha, nicest guy in the world. My girlfriend is from New Jersey and she was dying for a good bagel place. We tried many here in the valley and bagel man is definitely the best. Gotta love that pork roll!"}
{"text":"Great prices, fantastic bagels and a very friendly staff. Even at 6 AM on a Sunday morning.

If you want the bagel equivalent of watching your kid graduate from college, go visit the Bagel Man. Your only disappointment will come when you realize that you just ate 13 bagels in one sitting and now you have no leftover bagels. 

But seriously. I ate 13 bagels in one sitting."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here 3 times a week. The bagels are always fresh the pastrami egg and cheese you need to try one. 

                    Thank you"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh bagels, and jalapeño cream cheese... Can't beat that! Oh and very nice staff!!"}
{"text":"Two days in Phoenix so far, two days at The Bagel Man.  Outstanding bagels and crumb cake!  Friendly and efficient service, and incredible value.  For $5 and change, I had a gargantuan Egg Bagel with scrambled eggs, cheese and ham, and equally massive crumb cake!  Who needs lunch?!  This will easily last me until dinner.  See you tomorrow - going to give the Onion Bagel a try.  There was a wait for it yesterday!"}
{"text":"We love this place!! The secret is out, this is the best bagel place in town. The staff are friendly and fast, the bagels are delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a bagel in ahwatukee! The bagels are made fresh continuously throughout the day. Everytime I go i get a salt bagel. It is the only place around to get it. It is fast and cheap! Bagel and cream cheese is like $3! 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"I come here every weekend and it never disappoints. The staff is so friendly and the food is great. I'm from the east coast and I've spent the last three years looking for a place with authentic bagels. I can never go back to Einsteins after eating here."}
{"text":"This place's bagels are just incredible.  They are fresh, chewy, and made on-site.  I had \"The Sexy\" which was awesome.  The owner rang me up and was incredibly friendly.  If you love authentic, fresh bagels, this is your place."}
{"text":"Had to check out the place because of the reviews! It didn't WOW me like I was expecting, but they did gain a customer for sure!! The bagels were fresh and you had a multitude of choices.  A must try! Will be going back to try their lunch options! Side note... The Owner and Staff were very nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"The Bagel Man is the best! We use him for work lunches as well as breakfast meetings. Support your local eateries and you will be in for a treat. He makes them fresh every morning and they are as delicious as they come. You will love his homemade cream cheeses too. Great prices!"}
{"text":"I'll drive 25 minutes out of my way on my way to work to pick up bagels from The Bagel Man. The bagels are the size of my face and the cream cheese is fresh and hand mixed. This place makes makes me want to laugh at Einsteins."}
{"text":"Do you miss NYC and the neighborhood Bagel shop...Well it moved to Phoenix.

Bagels are great with a crust/shell and soft insides, not just browned bread.
Excellent base for Spreads and Sandwiches

Want to support a local business, this seems to be a family run business.

Sandwiches are great  as are the cream cheese spreads, smooth and tasty.

But I think the best part is the owner, welcoming and friendly and he remembers you after you have only been there ONCE.  I think he is from Jersey so it must be Jersey hospitality,,,Great to be welcomed into his business every time you step through the door.

No need to tell you so support local business, go get the best NYC bagel in Phoenix.

Just  happens to be in Awatukee."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great east coast style bagels and I love their lox. 

I would give Bagel Man 5 stars but the guy at the cashier always has a bad attitude. He tends to sigh loudly, roll his eyes and corrects me when ordering. The whole ordering experience is terrible because of him, I feel as though I am a burden to him especially when I have multiple orders for my coworkers and I but at least the owner, the cooks, and the food are always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Super fluffy bagel with house-made scallion cream cheese,, lox, tomato, onion, and capers! Yum!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in town! Baked fresh everyday. Lots of variety, and several flavors of cream cheese. The breakfast and lunch sandwiches are unique and taste great. Excellent friendly customer service and fun atmosphere. The owner is awesome and so is the staff."}
{"text":"5 stars for the delicious bagels: my fave: Lox sandwich
5 stars for the very affordable prices
5 stars for the supberb service!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in AZ! I'm from jersey and this place reminded me of home! They even have Taylor Ham. So happy to have found this place and highly recommend it to all! Just wish they were open Mondays!"}
{"text":"This place is a must at least every month. They have some unique offerings. The bagels can get pricey if you add lots on, but simple and plain is always best."}
{"text":"Okay, this place has basically the best bagels I've ever had. They are fresh, delicious, and the perfect size to satisfy the hunger beast without overdoing it. 

We walked in and were greeted by some awesome staff! They were all way nice and helpful with recommendations. As we looked over the menu a few people stopped in that seemed to be regulars, and they knew their names, orders, and asked them about personal things they had done that they obviously had heard about last time. Nice work! That's a touch of customer service many restaurants will never get to.

The bacon breakfast bagel on the salt bagel was delicious! And the everything with the cinnamon walnut spread was amazing. I'm really sad I'm only in town for a day or two or this would be my new weekly go to."}
{"text":"Tried this place before reading any reviews, and to my pleasant surprise, it was wonderful! Wonderful bagels, wonderful people!"}
{"text":"I seldom give out 5 Stars but anything less for this bagelmaster would be an injustice.  Unlike bagels back east, these bagels are less doughy and more fluffy on the inside.  The outside has a nice crunch and to top it all off they are probably a half inch larger than your normal bagel.
I had them make me an Everything Bagel, toasted with cream cheese, bacon and egg.  A truly amazing taste experience - not too garlicky, not too salty, just perfection in the form of a boiled piece of dough.  If I lived in Phoenix I would be eating here every weekend.
The only criticism is that the store's A/C doesn't ever seem to be working and so it gets a little warm if you decide to eat on site.  
When I return to Atlanta I will be stopping here before I board the plane to purchase a few to show what a real bagel should be.  
Kudos PHX - the best bagel West of the Mississippi!"}
{"text":"I love the bagel man and the staff. Food is great I always get breakfast here when I'm on this side of town sometimes I even drive when I'm not just because I know the quality and service is excellent. I am an everything bagel type of girl with bacon egg and cheese."}
{"text":"Best spot in AZ for real bagels. As a jersey girl, these guys are the real deal. Tastes just like back home. Amazing."}
{"text":"This place is hands-down the best bagels in Arizona. Not only are the bagels perfection, the staff is truly a blessing. I want to go every day! Lol Def a must!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here bc of the pretty good yelp ratting. Yelp reviews can be brutal. Brought these to the office everyone loved them one said the best she ever had. People that are complaining about the softness are correct. They have a crisp outside and very soft inside. I thought they were outstanding by far the best I had in the US for bagel or bread. I moved here from Europe and I have had a hard time finding great bread this is really good. Definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"As a Jew, I can appreciate a bagel that's not only delicious but also super cheap. This place has huge, doughy homemade bagels with a variety of homemade cream cheeses. Extra points for the owner being super sweet and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I rarely give eateries 5 stars.  Many 4 stars (as I choose them diligently using Yelper's recommendations of course), but 5 stars is a rarity.

I gave The Bagel Man 5 stars for a couple fundamental reasons. 1) The food was delicious at a very reasonable price. 2) They were extremely friendly. Especially the person who I assumed was \"the bagel man\" himself.  That's it folks.  That's all it takes to earn a 5 star from this guy..... But it's a wonder I can't give out more of them....

I ate the Scrambled egg and lox on an everything bagel. Perfect!  My daughter had the scrambled egg and bacon on a plain bagel.  She said her's was very good also, but I'd have to say I won with my choice. 

We will visit them again tomorrow before heading further north, and I plan on winning again!

Do yourself a flavor and check them out if you're in this hood."}
{"text":"Love this place. I thought Long Island was the only place to get an amazing bacon egg and cheese. Bagels are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Found on Yelp, easy to get to. Fun friendly atmosphere, great greeting. Lots of choices, fresh bagels.

Ordered the lox and cream cheese on garlic bagel. 

Hubby had scrambled egg, bacon on garlic bagel.

Bagels were good size, and they did not skimp on ingredients, including the lox, cream cheese, and capers. Most garlic bagels can't taste the garlic. This was spot on. When in Phoenix this will be our look forward to, must stop place.

Very fast service."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Arizona.  Not like those round bread things you get at other places like Einstein bros and such.  Everything with bacon, egg and cheese or blueberry with ham, egg and cheese are delicious!  Go.  You will love this place!"}
{"text":"I am from New York. I was born in Brooklyn. My first word was Bagel. This place is fantastic. The staff is super kind and attentive. It would stack up against several places I love back home. 
If you are on a road trip and need breakfast, stop here."}
{"text":"Great bagels, great prices and great service... that's all that needs to be said... and I'm from NY."}
{"text":"The service was great & the food was even better!! We got a bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel & the Show Off bagel. Highly recommend! It was also fast so we were in and out in 5 minutes!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It has authentic New York style bagels and cream cheese. I especially enjoy their onion bagel toasted with veggie cream cheese. Their iced coffee is also top notch. I will be back and will recommend to all my friends and family! Keep it up Bagel Man!! You make my mornings so happy!"}
{"text":"Large selection of bagels early in the am.  We went here on a Saturday am because it is the earliest opening bagel shop in the Tuke.  Friendly customer service too along with prices that are a good value.  If you are an early riser, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The health department need to pay this place a visit.  It was so grouse in my opinion. The guy was sweating and dripping all over the place.  He had a glove on, but was touching everything with his glove plus using his glove hand to take and count back cash.  Then he uses that gloved hand that whipped his brow, touched my money and grabs a handful of bagels.  I took my bagel and dropped it in the trash on the way out."}
{"text":"I was craving bagels that are like in New York, soft and fluffy on the inside but nice golden on top! And I found this place on yelp and it had great reviews so I had to check it out! 
The bagels are amazing here! These are the top bagels that I've had in AZ and they are quite similar to bagels that are in New York! The inside of the bagels were soft and fluffy but had a nice crunch on the outside! There weren't many bagels left for us to get so we got the plain, onion, and the everything bagel with the scallion cream cheese! 
It was so delicious and would have to try their bagel breakfast sandwiches next time!"}
{"text":"Seriously, if you're into bagels you MUST come here! Consider it a sacred pilgrimage for all bagel lovers.  The actual \"Bagel Man\" is always available to greet and assist his loyal flock. He makes bagels once each morning and when they are gone the shop closes, so get here early!  Just thinking about this place makes me want to camp outside until he opens again in the morning. The bagels have a wonderful crisp outside with a sensual chewy inside. I won't even compare them to other \"wanna-be\" bagel joints in the area because that would be downright disrespectful. He makes a mean bagel sandwich and potato salad too! I almost forgot to mention he makes his own cream cheese spreads too. The store itself isn't full of frills, nor will you find a fancy lounge area because it's not about the shop, it's about the BAGELS! Get them to-go!"}
{"text":"Had my first sandwich from the bagel man today. It was really tasty. They make the bagels there at the shop. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just moved here from New York two months ago, so I was extremely skeptical when hearing Bagel Man bagels tasted like back home. I'm happy to report they are easily the closest thing you can get to an authentic New York bagel here in Arizona. Only wish they had egg everything bagels! That's a New York staple, not to mention my favorite.

From the tastes of it, anything you order is going to be delicious. They also \"shmear\" the bagels in a true New York fashion- aka cream cheese dripping out of every edge.

While I'll still be smuggling egg everything and rainbow bagels from back home in my suitcase when I visit, I'll be a regular here at bagel man. I couldn't be happier to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Most scrumptious bagel I've ever had. I got a rich and famous sandwich on a salt bagel and it was excellent. The \"bagel man\" is so nice and welcoming. Macaroni salad is excellent. All around great experience getting lunch here."}
{"text":"Owner gave my bagel to his buddy who was two people behind me and then gave me the wrong bagel.

Good first impression"}
{"text":"Awesome people, great variety will definitely return and recommend. We walked in were greeted by the owner very nice man."}
{"text":"The energy in this place reminded me of why I love small businesses. The owner new regulars by name, caught up with familiar faces that have moved away from the area but stopped by for some bagel goodness.  And the most important aspect was the quality of the food. You can feel the love and expertise that's put into the bagels here. Even though I got the Reuben (excellent choice), I couldn't help but sampling my wife's and Son's bagels. The crispy outside, soft interior, and flavorful cream cheese smear made it a winner!"}
{"text":"The Best Bagels HANDS DOWN!!! My sister drives all the way from North Phoenix to get this guys Bagels!!! ;-)"}
{"text":"I forgot to mention this but I have not had bagels this good in the west coast, ever! Literally feel like I'm in Stanton Island when I'm sinking teeth in these bagels and these guys definitely are very fast and they know how to run a great operation."}
{"text":"Frankly I thought they were awful, and I'm a bread eater. I could barely eat half. Now, I haven't completely given it the thumbs down because I only tried the bagel and the other stuff on the menu looks kind of good. I will update if and IF I ever come back. Now, as for the numerous people mentioning New Jersey. These are supposed to be NY bagels. Why is anyone mentioning Jersey. Once and for all! Jersey is not and never will be NYC. And I don't know where the rest of you are from in NY. Long Island perhaps? Buffalo maybe? Those are NOT NY bagels. Again, as in the pizza. Maybe its the water."}
{"text":"Say no to fast food on a road trip... this place was amazing and right off the 10. The lox was fresh. The olive cream cheese spread on point. It is very fresh so can be drippy but worth the mess. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great bagels, great coffee, great coffee cake.  A perfect breakfast!  Friendly staff and happy customers."}
{"text":"Went to a meeting at my sons school and they had bagels on the table, normally I would pass because I am from back east where the bagels are Real bagels. I noticed that these bagels were very large,looked very fresh 
and  loaded with toppings on the sesame and the cinnamon raisin bagels had plump generous portions of raisins. I grabbed 1/2 of one put it in the toaster and when it was done I let it cool. Finally it was ready for the green onion cream cheese, I was blown away!!!!! I have not had a bagel this good in over 12 years. I asked where did these bagels come from and someone finally told me from the Bagelman which often has long  long lines out front. This confirmed  my theory that these were no ordinary bagels these were super bagels."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, stop by The Bagel Man for a bagel for breakfast ... you won't be disappointed! We finally found the opportune time to go in & I got something a little different - a cheese bagel with scallion cream cheese & my date got the Egg & Lox bagel with the works. The bagels were really big and fluffy; I'm hoping they're hot and fresh the entire day, but as we had gone in pretty early in the day, they definitely were. There was a bit too much cream cheese on the bagel but it was easily spread off.

I'm a huge fan of bagels as it is, so it's plain & simple - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just with once eating here, I'm a big fan! The bagels taste incredibly fresh and have that perfect crust and chewy inside that Einstein or any other supposed \"bagel\" place can't match. 

I ordered a crazy combo because im a pregnant, hungry mom! It was lox, bacon, and eggs with scallion cream cheese on a warm, freshly baked Everything Bagel. ....ahhhh,it was outstanding. 

The guys working that fine early Sun morning were upbeat, fun and helpful. ..i think they must enjoy their job, which says a lot about the owners. 

I'll def be back again when I'm on this side of the I10."}
{"text":"Amazing. I had lox on an everything bagel with the works. The bagel was fresh out of the oven and still warm. The amount of lox was very generous. Best bagel I've had in Arizona. Highly recommend. Also, I loved how they cut it in half :)"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels!!! This is an excellent stop right off the interstate! Friendly and inviting staff! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This guy's bagels are the best I've had in the area. This local joint would put any chain and most of their competition to shame. Definitely stop by if you are in Tempe/Ahwatukee area. The bread literally melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"The best bagels in Ahwatukee.  The staff is always friendly and helpful even when they are busy."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Long line but worth the wait. Ordered their breakfast bagel with sausage and jalapeño spread. It was out of this world good. Felt like I flew to NYC for breakfast. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was super yummy!! Reminded us of when we were in Queens, NY. Great food, environment, friendly staff and bagels were as advertised, NY delicious."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! I had the everything bagel with jalepeno  cream cheese. It was delicious and the owner is really cool too. The only reason I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars is because it's my second favorite bagel shop in the valley. Definitely the best on that side of town. My favorite is all the way east kokobelli :)"}
{"text":"Bagel Man is so good I was inspired to write an advertising jingle about the place.  Seriously.

The first thing you have to order is the egg and cheese . . . but with bacon, sausage AND roast ham.  Do it.  Check out the pic I posted . . . LOOK at that cross-section

Next, get wild and crazy.  Get the Lox . . . special ordered with bacon.  Yes.  Trust me.  Unkosher that bad boy.  Garlic toasted bagel, house made scallion cream cheese, Lox AND bacon.  The silky smoked salmon with crispy bacon . . . fantastic.

Everything is held together with excellent bagels that frankly put Chompie's to shame.  Seriously.  And the house made cream cheeses . . . smooth and creamy and decadent.  Yes, decadent.  And they certainly do not skimp on the bacon.

If you live and/or work in northern Ahwatukee, you need to hit this place up"}
{"text":"These bagels are beyond fabulous!!!  The owner has a friendly smile and comment for everyone.  Hands down the best bagels I have ever had in AZ.  This place truly is a gem!"}
{"text":"No need to bring bagels home from NY! These are chewy goodness. Try the toasted everything bagel with veggie cream cheese. Or the pumpernickel rye with a scallion schmear. Salt bagels sell out early!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Love how they use good ingredients and make their bread the old traditional way. Plus it's a private small business who I much rather support than some big corp."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem! I have had this spot booked mark for sometime now and finally made it to try out!

Very small bagel spot in a large strip mall.  I would say mostly take out in terms of eating, with a few tables outside. Let me preface this by saying I'm from Long Island where we take bagels very seriously!! So I was stoked when I saw the good reviews about this place.  

I ordered cinnamon raisin bagel with veggie cream cheese ( don't knock it till you try it). I was pleasantly surprised, the cinnamon raisin had lots of flavor and the veggie cream cheese had crisp veggie chunks in it which it great!! 

I ordered 6 bagels to go of other flavors and those didn't  disappoint and they held up in softness and weren't rock hard the next day , always a plus! Overall defiantly worth checking out if you looking for a cute little bagel place."}
{"text":"Wow! The lox bagel sans tomato and the blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese...yeah you heard right. Who the heck eats two bagels for breakfast...? the blueberry was originally supposed to be for breakfast tomorrow but i just couldn't help myself. True New York bagels that are incredibly soft on the inside. Mmm mmm mm!! I'll be here all week and will certainly be going back!!!"}
{"text":"I can't add anything different from other reviews. These are THE best bagels in Arizona. They are made on-site and are served straight off the rack. 

Smiling faces and top notch service. They treat everyone like a friend, offering the best service and food that they can."}
{"text":"Lived in the NYC area for 15 years, got used to a certain standard of bagels. The best I'd found in PHX since moving here in 2012 was Scott's Generations on 7th St. They were decent bagels, but not memorable. Just bought my first dozen at Bagel Man. Excellent, excellent. As good as my favorite place back east. They were still warm, as they should be. The scallion cream cheese I bought was also wonderful. So glad to have found this place. I'll be back, even though it's a 20 minute drive for me."}
{"text":"My New Yorker hubby feels like he's back on Long Island! This place is legit!! Lox on Everything bagel is amazing!!"}
{"text":"So excited they're open on mondays now too! 7 days!!! Amazing bagels. The everything's are incredible, but the last two saturdays I've been in they've been out of everythings, which is so disappointing. Great bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, awesome cream cheeses, etc."}
{"text":"Hallelujah. Finally a decent bagel in this culinary wasteland that is Ahwatukee. No longer will I suffer the insult that is Einstein's or make my colleagues suffer along with me. It's Bagel Man for the office from now on."}
{"text":"Still love this place just as much. It's convenient and locally owned, affordable, variety, and consistent! Thanks to Kal and his quality (and quality staff), you always know you're gonna get a great breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome bagels. If you have not had a bagel from the east coast this is the place to try. The cream cheese is very good as well. Service is what you would expect from a mom and pop shop...very personable service. Prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"The Bagel are very good.the line out the door told me all I needed to know, as this was my first time. My wife and I stumbled upon this Bagel shop."}
{"text":"Best  bagels I've found in Arizona. I'm from the east coast and these are as good as bagels back there"}
{"text":"Staying by the airport and saw the great reviews for this place.    Took uber over and was not disappointed.    Great service and great bagels"}
{"text":"Between Odelay and Bagel Man, these are the top locally owned bagel places in the area. Enjoy both of them and usually alternate between them. Each is a notch above the chain places with Bagel Man's offerings bigger than Odelay. While BM offers the standard fare, Odelay serves some innovative items such as parmesan and black pepper. Really hard to choose between the two so I  just go to both."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich with bagel and egg.  Wife had breakfast sandwich with bagel, egg and cheese.  Hers was much better.  Mine was okay, but the melted cheese really made the sandwich.  We also ordered a bagel to go.  Bagels were very tasty...  crispy on the outside and a little chewy on the inside.  Everything just tasted very fresh.  Would definitely eat here again, even though we live in Tucson."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic, east coast style bagel, go to East Coast Bagels on Southern at McClintock (near the Goodwill). They close early in the afternoon, but they're so much better."}
{"text":"I love the food and the prices it's very fair and the best begel shop in the valley... But ever since the owner hired a bunch of young kids i haven't wanted to go back... The kids have messed up my order 3 out of four times and they all have attitudes when you go in. I want the owner to come back and run it again."}
{"text":"Best bagels I've ever had!  The owner is very genuine and sweet and the staff is so great too!!  This place is my favorite place to go for a quick breakfast.  I love the bagel man!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Bagel Man for a quick breakfast after a few days at a nearby resort.  The excellent service, fair prices, and delicious bagel sandwiches were exactly what we needed.

We met The Bagel Man himself.  He strolled through the door with a smile, greeted everyone, put on an apron and headed to the back to make some more everything bagels (we just took the last one).  

This is the kind of bagel shop I love to find.  Great for breakfast or lunch.  Their bagels and cream cheeses are all homemade, and you can taste the difference!"}
{"text":"Great little place to get a coffee and bagel in the morning. Owner is super friendly and has great customer service. Will drive across town anytime to get one of his amazing bagels. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, delicious and fresh bagels!  Fast pleasant service!  Very big portions on the lox bagel with 'the works'.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Bagel heaven! The most fluffy, moist bagels ever. True NY style, which are boiled before baking. These suckers are huge, fresh and there are a variety of flavor options to choose from with sandwiches, bagels and fresh cream cheese. The shop isn't anything to look at, but they make up for it with the quality of their food and the kindness of their staff. The honey walnut spread is great as are the cheese and everything bagels (not with that spread...unless special flavor combos float your boat. :-) Go at an off hour in the morning to avoid crowds and sell-outs and don't plan on eating there, as seating is sparse and cramped right against the ordering area. Must try this place!"}
{"text":"Wow, So nice to get authentic bagels in Phoenix! Service was friendly and food was delish.  It's definitely a to go spot; I sat here eating for 20 mins and saw 30 people come in and out with dozens of bagels in hand and no one else sat down. I can't believe I've been in ahwatukee more than 7 years and just found this place!"}
{"text":"Very small shop, but all items were pretty good. As a true NY guy, I can judge bagels and although these have that crunchy, chewy texture, they were only my 2nd favorite choice now. These don't toast up that well, but they stay fresh for days and probably don't need a freezer for at least 4 days. There is still one other valley bagel shop that gets my nod. Check reviews.
The bagel Sandwich - cute name, can't remember it, but Turkey and they say fresh mozzarella (but it wasn't fresh, just sliced). They use Boars Head here which will always make a sandwich decent and the herb mayo was a good touch too.
Macaroni salad - homemade, but not the best version (go for the bag of chips)

Olive Cream Cheese - $3.50 this was unusual and would say to try it if you like olives of course."}
{"text":"worth a visit for housemade cream cheese alone. best and cheapest lox n bagel sandwich I've had."}
{"text":"It was a great fresh bagels that I every taste they have different cream cheeses.  my husband had a sandwich of ham and cheese he love it they make bagel fresh everyday"}
{"text":"This was my go to for bagels in the valley even though it was a shlep. However, he seems to have lost his way. Looks more like The Bread Man now. The bagels have gotten too big and have lost their shape and consistency. 

I'll give it another go in about a month and see if things improve."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. The best bagel I have had since working for Baffos deli in Dallas back in 1990."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and never had one bad experience with this place. The owners and staff here are super friendly, pleasant, and welcoming. 

The shop decor isn't anything fancy. Just a typical authentic NYC bagel shop with fresh bagels made daily, a variety of awesome cream cheeses and toppings, pleasant Jewish owners, diverse staffing and random black and white photos of NYC landmarks. Every time I step into this shop, it feels like I just teleported myself to NYC. 

Great food, awesome people, perfect NYC ambient. The best part is the price you pay is so not NYC! Looking forward to trying out more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I guess it is only fitting that I write a review for The Bagel Man as my husband just left to grab our breakfast there.  As others have said, these bagels are superb and the service is stellar.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh.  No fru-fru coffee drinks here (just the basic cup, which is fine with me), the focus is on the bagels, and that is obvious.  

Small little place and it can get busy, but it seems to go fast.  Get in line, order your food, maybe grab some coffee while you wait.  Pay when it is ready and either sit at one of the few tables inside or sit outside to enjoy the nice AZ weather.

Breakfast sandwiches, fresh made flavored cream cheese (I asked for jalapeno cream cheese and he made some for me on the spot, cream cheese + jalapenos), Boar's Head meat for the lunch sandwiches, and some home baked pastries (from someone else's home).  

With all of the good stuff on the menu, my absolute favorite is the lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel with all the fixin's (tomato, onion, capers). YUM!  I could go on, but my breakfast has arrived and it is time to eat!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that I have spent most of my life living in New York and I am absolutely critical of all bagels that I eat.

Now, let me say that Bagel Man carries by far the best bagel I have ever tasted outside of New York State. The owner has a location back east as well, so it is no surprise that he knows what he's doing. You can try anywhere else you want in the Phoenix metro region, but you will never find a bagel that comes even close to the flavor and taste of these authentic bagels. Every single one of my family and friends that have come to visit me agree. In addition, anytime I introduce these bagels to any of my local friends they are blown away and from then on will not buy a bagel anywhere else. 

Plain and simple, Bagel Man has the absolute best bagels you will have outside of New York and I have even found in many occasions that his bagels are better than some of the places back east."}
{"text":"Bagel Man was open on a Monday, which they just started doing, but also the Monday during Christmas. This is very kind to do for those that don't want to cook for the holidays! It also saves everyone from the usually chain restaurants. We are frequent customer to this business, but being open on Christmas is truly wonderful. Thank you to all the staff at Bagel Man giving up time with your families to be here for others. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this lil gem this morning via my homey Yelp, and once again it steered me right!  These bagels are delicious!  The perfect consistency, density, chewiness, and they boil em!  The way they are supposed to be made... Unlike that chain place out here in the desert :) it's a tiny lil shop in a strip mall and kind of hidden but seek it out and stop in!  Great prices and quality food.  Breakfast and lunch sandwiches as well as some pastries and fresh made cream cheese in house!  Only downfalls would be the size of the place and it was really hot in there.  Just get your food to go and the problem is solved :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Owner is friendly, food is amazing...nothing to complain about. I love this place. Want it everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, that know and love their food. Lox bagel was delicious and they hooked it up with all the fixings!"}
{"text":"Great bagels & bialys! Stop by for a cup of perfect coffee, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am from back east, these are HANDS DOWN the best bagels I have tasted in AZ."}
{"text":"Great bagels in AZ! Jersey style will always have my heart, but this stop is my go to in Ahwatukee! Vegan options available always a plus for me / Hummus, potatoes, PB&J! Service always great - fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"The best bagels in phoenix area... Been here couple of times never disappointed. Friendly staff great service ."}
{"text":"Super awesome bagel sandwich. I had the bacon, egg, and cheese on a everything bagel, and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is authentic as a NY Bagel place can be. They're also willing to let you try things and make sure you're experience is one you'll talk about. Glad local businesses like this one are here!"}
{"text":"I don't like bagels but a friend of mine forced me to try the bagel man and I'm he did. Since then I've had a bagel at least 3x of week!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. I was looking forward to a good New York style bagel after reading all the good reviews. However I was a bit disappointed by the bagel itself, it was a little doughy. I got a ham egg and cheese bagel sandwich and they kinda of skimp on the ham and eggs. Their cream cheese was good though and you can tell they make it in house. Overall it was good for the price but I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The Bagel Man has THE BEST lox bagel in Arizona. You are missing out if you haven't stopped in."}
{"text":"The best! Old style NY type bagels. The owners are great!  On weekends get here early am for bagels; they are gone early! Deli is all Boars Head. I suggest a hot pastrami on pumpernickel with swiss and mustard! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"I don't need to write a review because everyone knows that the bagel man is the best vegan in AZ. If you don't believe me just give it try"}
{"text":"Great Bagels!   Owner is real deal.  13 bagels for $10 great deal."}
{"text":"Heaven in my mouth. Best bagels in AZ, always fresh. I know bagels pretty well being from NJ. They actually have Taylor Ham... Mind blown. Now that I know this place exists I will be editing some reviews I left for other bagel shops because they have alot to live up to now."}
{"text":"Best Bagels in town hands down!! The cream cheese melts in your mouth, the bagels are just phenomenal! We ordered a blueberry, and a jalapeño bagel...they were not overpowering at all. Very fresh ingredients. Try it at least once and you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The only bagels in Arizona that meet my high Brooklyn standards. These bagels are flaky, crusty, everything that a real bagel, not a round piece of bread with a hole inside, should be. He's even stuck to real bagel types, as you won't find any prissy blueberry or cinnamon sugar bagels like you'd find at Einstein Bros. The owner, Kal, is a Jersey native, so he's as qualified as they come for bagel making. He cares a lot about his product and his customers, and knows almost everyone who walks in the door by name. Every time I visit, he remembers that I drive from Phoenix, want a baker's dozen, and need extra freezer bags. Also he has egg bagels. Yay egg bagels!

Last time I went, he even agreed to start making egg everything bagels for me (egg bagels with the everything bagel's topping set). So stop on in and get one!"}
{"text":"I've had friends ship bagels to me from New York and they were always better than anything I can get here in Phoenix. The bagels here at Bagel Man are just as good as anything I've had from New York. The service is good and friendly. Prices are great. Sandwiches are awesome. My favorite is the Rich & Famous on a salt bagel. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I do love coming here. It has a city feel right here in my suburb. I like that it is a small owner run Business. The service is always very friendly. Delicious food. The lox breakfast sandwich is one that I often crave."}
{"text":"The Bagel Man deserves all the rave reviews!  I was up early this morning wondering who was open at 5:30 a.m., and was also looking for a place I've never been and this joint fit the bill.  I had a honey wheat bagel toasted with the honey almond spread and it was delicious!  Warm and chewy and just what my belly needed that early in the morning.  The employees were fast and friendly too.  I've attached photos of their menu as of today.  This would be a perfect stop before a hike or bike ride on South Mountain.  And a great stop for lunch when you're done.  I can't wait to grab the unsuspecting Mr. M and go back.  The only reason I would ever go back to Einstein Bros. was if I was craving a cinn/sugar bagel."}
{"text":"I've had bagels around Az for the past 10 years. This place is definitely the best, the owner has another location in New Jersey. Great service and food! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pork roll, egg and cheese on everything?  Yes they got that. And probably the only place in AZ that has pork roll, or even knows what it is. I ordered it and the guy automatically knew I was from Jersey. These are real bagels. Not rolls with holes.  If there are two things that sum up a man from Jersey its bagels and pork roll. Damn close to the bagels I know and love from my hometown. Though I live in Gilbert I will be making the drive to Ahwatukee for my dozens."}
{"text":"I got the egg and lox sandwich on an everything bagel with plain cream cheese. The bagel was so fresh out of the oven that they didn't even need to heat the bagel for my warm sandwich. The bagel was absolutely delicious and there was a good amount of lox and toppings for the price. The prices are a lot more reasonable compared to the other bagel places in the area. My boyfriend got the sausage and egg sandwich on a plain bagel (he's a plain eater) and said it's the best bagel sandwich he's ever had from a place in Arizona. 

The staff was so incredibly friendly. Even though it was my first time there and I was so overwhelmed with the amount of yummy things to choose from, the employees helped me decide what to get and I'm so glad they did. 

There isn't much space to eat so my boyfriend and I got it to go and had a picnic at a near by park. I wish there was more seating because all the tables were full. The food was so good though that I didn't mind at all and I will definitely be back very soon. I'm happy to give all my bagel business to The Bagel Man from now on!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this shop, but someone at my work brings these bagels in every Friday.. to Dunlap and Peoria. They are awesome bagels!!!! .. Very fresh, the absolutely best I've ever tasted anywhere."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the first time. Got a simple bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. Fantastic. I don't know how they make something so simple taste so good. Don't be thrown off by the small, slightly dated interior, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"The bagels are fantastic! I work near here and stop by for lunch from time to time. They use Boar's Head deli meat which is the only way to go in my opinion. They are also very quick to make my food, which I definitely appreciate. The restaurant is small and no frills, but the service and food are terrific!"}
{"text":"This I probably one of my favorite egg sandwich shops we stop here a lot to pick up something and they are so quick"}
{"text":"Best bagel shop I've ever been to, kills anywhere on Maui and half the price! Fresh huge bagels and a New York flair of soft cream cheese and really fresh ingredients. Owner is a great guy, too. He gave me samples for the road, even."}
{"text":"Nothing, I mean nothing, will ever beat an H & H bagel if you are from the NYC area.
But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised while in Phoenix last week to have a delish NY style bagel shop across the street from my hotel.  The Bagel Man makes a good bagel. And even better tuna salad and I am a tuna lover.  Better than my Jewish mom's tuna salad!  It even came with a pickle and some pretty decent potato salad.
They even have some deli sandwiches. All at reasonable prices.
How good is this place?  They close at 2pm and by 1:30 when we got there they only had 3 bagels left. Not 3 flavors, 3 bagels.  Got my pumpernickel, hubby got the last poppy. Now I have to fly back to Phoenix for the tuna on an everything bagel and get there before closing."}
{"text":"I cannot stress this enough. If you arrive here while the Bagels are coming fresh out of the oven DO NOT order them toasted. The fresh bagel is perfection. It will be crackly on the outside and chewy and tender on the inside. Toasting is for store bought bagels.

The service here is a little haphazard, many of the workers will try and take your order, just talk to one of them and your order will be fulfilled. I had an Everything Bagel with Sliced Lox Sandwich. 3 days in a row. And while the salty Lox maybe the big draw for some, the bagel was the star of the show. Long meetings and lactose intolerance prevented me from enjoying the simple delights of a Bagel and Cream Cheese (of which they have many flavors). But I can tell you these Bagels are good enough to eat dry.

Do not miss out on this place. If you are staying at the Sheraton, brave that 120° parking lot. It is worth even that."}
{"text":"Came to the Bagel Man looking for a new breakfast spot and was anything but disappointed.   The freshness of the bagels along with the varieties was both impressive and delicious.  I ordered an egg, cheese, bacon bagel sandwich for $4 and i love the option of adding tomatoes/onions at no cost.  An ice coffee is $1.99.  Overall, you'll be left satisfied with an excellent meal for $6.  I will be a frequent customer from now on."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. I had an everything bagel with egg, bacon and American cheese. Not too filling, reasonably priced. I'll definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"My BF and I have been testing bagels throughout the Valley, trying to find our NY-style favorite. Coming from the East Coast we've been struggled to find good bagels and seafood. Well, The Bagel Man has both. The Lox was great and so was the wide variety of bagels. 

Beyond the good food, this place also has a great atmosphere. Immediately upon entering the store, we were greeted by the owner and one of his staff members. We also got a few extra things thrown in our order, probably because we came in on a Sunday just before closing time. 

Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Yummy bagels and cream. My favorite is jalapeno bagel and veggie cream cheese toasted. Me and my boyfriend love going there."}
{"text":"Hello. Need to educate. From Brooklyn Staten Island Catskills New York  and Nj. Loved the bagel mans style of bagel. Had the jalapeño plain with nothing on it and the everything plain nothing on it. Would come back and purchase bagels again. I have eaten from the best ny bagel bakeries in the ny area for 55 years. AUTHENTIC BAGELS ARE BOILED AND THEN BAKED. Like any baker it is an art. Fact, these bagels are excellent in their own right. They are not New York style bagels in the least bit. Anyone claiming they are is out of touch with reality. If you are from New York and are looking for authentic style jewish ny bagels then a trip to chompies bakery in Scottsdale is where they have the old style rye breads pumpernickel breads bagels and cakes that you grew up with back in the 1950's. Chompies also has a Sattelite store on w frye rd by the chandler mall. This being said I enjoy both styles very much. The classic ny chompies style bagel and the bagel mans recipe for his bagels which are excellent also. As for NEW JERSEY, there is no such thing as a nj style bagel. You can buy a bagel at 50 different stores in nj and get 50 different tastes and textures. There is only one way to make a classic by style Jewish bagel which is where they originated but there are thousands of variations. The bagel man makes one of the best variation of a NY STYLE BAGEL, but the taste and texture have nothing to do with the ny original. Call it an Arizona style bagel and it hands down wins the title best Arizona style bagel"}
{"text":"Cool place. It is rare to see the owner/operator still spending time at the counter, talking, greeting and even hugging some close customers. But their bagel is the best. I had a breakfast sandwich with lox and scrambled egg, onion, caper...that was delicious. Fresh and toasted everything bagel was absolutely the right base for all that on top. He even announced to incoming customers what kind of bagel just came off the baking oven...I have my eyes on either the Boss or the New York Ruben for the next return."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, mom and pop shop feel, super friendly with customers and always efficient and tasty with their food. 

Come here about 1 to 2 times a week and grab large orders for me and my co-workers never a complaint from anybody. 

All varieties of bagels and bagel sandwiches are available and everything is always fresh, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Firstly, you know you're doing things right if your friends live across the street from the Bagel Man and they take you every time you come to town! Second you know you're going to have a good day once you are eating the delicious bagels and food there! And lastly you know the world is right when a kind gentleman comes up and buys you your entire lunch!

All fun aside, the Bagel Man has some of the best bagels I've ever had in my life. And coming from a Jew I think that means a lot! I always have the egg bagels if they have them in stock but I dare you to try anything there and tell me it's not good. The quality of the food is perfect. The staff and owner are incredibly lovely, friendly and personable. Makes me wish I lived just across the street! 

Thanks Bagel Man! (And the guy who bought me my lunch!)"}
{"text":"I often travel and there it is such a treat when I find a hidden gem.  The Bagel Man has forever changed my expectations of the Bagel.  Best I've ever had.   And the service proves they love what they do."}
{"text":"The best bagel we've had in the Phoenix area. Bagels are large yet airy and flavorful. Being an ice tea lover, I'm thrilled that they have a fresh fruity tea. They have stevia too which is a plus. We haven't had their sandwiches but have heard they're delish."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!! Cal (owner) is an amazingly gracious and friendly guy!! He will know and remember you after your first visit. These are far and away the BEST bagels I've ever eaten, ever! Made completely from scratch ON SITE!!  You can see them being mixed, proofed, boiled and baked!!  Taste them fresh and hot straight from the kitchen!! This place, the staff, the food feel like home!! THE BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"A friendly atmosphere with an amazing owner. He always lets me wait for the freshest bagel and is from the northeast and my hometown so he definitely understands what makes a good bagel. Don't waste your time at einsteins bagel. I've recommended his restaurant to many people, no one has been disappointed!"}
{"text":"4.5* rounded up because the round dough with holes in the center trying to pass for bagels in PHX & Las Vegas are so severely lacking in any semblance to what they are supposed to be, that when I find a place like this, after kissing the ground like the Pope, I round up. The Man knows how to make bagels, people. And bialys! Bialys, I tell you: I wanted to cry when I saw them. 

Anywho, my SILs have lived in the 'Tuk forever,  when we moved here they told us see the Man about some NY style bagels. The first time we went it was at opening, and our bagels were still hot! The salt and pumpernickel are my favorites; Scott is an everything or egg man: \"Goo goo g' joob\" (that's the Beatles, millennials) When my Mom was here, she asked for bagels every day: Brooklyn born and bred stamp of approval!

They do run out of bagels early, you will encounter a line occasionally, but they move quick. 5* as good as it gets in PHX fo sho! 

* closed Mondays *
** they have deli sammies **
** breakfast menu ***
**** nice lox and yummy homemade cream cheese varieties ****"}
{"text":"Hands down, best bagel in Arizona. This bagel shop dishes up original NY style bagels. Inexpensive, unassuming and always great service. keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when walking in, I didn't check reviews first because I always give bagel places a chance. I'm from Ohio and miss the great Jewish NY-style deli's I had all around me, because there is a serious lack of them in Arizona. However, Bagel Man has the best bagels in the valley. They have great varieties and are incredibly delicious and last for longer than most you would get at Chompie's or some other fake deli. The owner was awesome, he introduced himself and was doing everything well. They serve Boar's Head meat which is the best if you ask me and they have some variety for being a small place. I recommend this place to all for a nice little lunch or bringing bagels home or to the office."}
{"text":"A great bagel is hard to find west of the Northeast. The Bagel Man produces bagels the follow the traditional method of boiling the dough before finishing it off in the oven. It's what provides the shiny and crispy exterior that covers the soft and chewy moist dough on the inside. A bagel that is simply baked is nothing more than baked bread..........and should never be referred to as a bagel. This was a great Yelp find and I'm sure to return whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"Bagel with Lox I had here was the BIGGEST one I have ever had in my life in Midwest life, East Coast life, and West Coast life all combined. It was HUGE with the most generous amount of lox and other stuff in it - like a lox explosion! I couldn't believe it.

And it was tasty."}
{"text":"Delish!!  The best bagel I've ever had.  We tried, cheese, plain, jalepeno and everything.   All have great flavor and texture.  The egg sandwiches are great too.  Friendly service and reasonable price for a big bagel.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh man am I coming here for breakfast again! I workout right across the 10 on Elliot, and today I was feeling completely famished afterwards. Yelped some nearby breakfast locations and this seemed to have great reviews. I'm not from New York, but I do have decent bagel standards. My so, who IS from New York, was with me, and he has high bagel standards. 

The place still had customers hanging around even though it was only an hour until they supposedly close at noon. We were greeted by two people, one of which  guessing was the owner (by other review descriptions). Our orders were taken immediately and rung up. The owner was cheerful and jokingly said that 'I would never go to Starbucks again after I tasted their coffee'. I'm not hard to please and ordered a breakfast sandwich with bacon on a sesame bagel, and a small coffee. My so ordered the same thing on a cinnamon raisin bagel. 

Bagels were tasty! And the eggs looked real. Not that liquid egg stuff. The coffee was yummy and I was happy! My so said that this looked like a typical bagel joint back in NY, with baskets of bagels, a small crew and quick service. I would definitely come here again after workouts for a quick breakfast stop. Bagels are way better here than from any major chain. It looks like they also have lunch sandwiches and a few other things to try."}
{"text":"Six months ago I moved back to Phoenix from living in NYC for a few years, and these bagels bring me back.  They are consistently baked perfectly and have that wonderful balance of chew and crisp and air and softness. Only thing I miss is the non-dairy based cream cheese options... Would love it if they offered at least one non-dairy variety.  So I usually just buy mine to go and smear at home."}
{"text":"Super nice, helpful owner who has been making bagels in New Jersey and AZ for 30+ years.  It shows!  Bagels are large and fluffy with a decent crust. Toppings on both sides and great homemade cream cheeses. Veggie is my favorite!
Can't go wrong here and we've already been back a few times in just a few weeks!"}
{"text":"Everyday I wake up dreaming about these bagels! This is the place to be!

The bagel man is such a hard working guy and is always welcoming to every customer that comes in. He is there pretty much everyday and has a hard working crew too.

The bagels here are seriously the best bagels I have ever had. I have even visited New York and these are on par if not better. Top cream cheese spread would have to be the scallion but the Lox comes in a close second for me. As for bagels, the salt bagel is the best I have ever had. 

The prices are great and it's a great pick me up early in the morning. I'm already looking forward to tomorrow morning just so I can have a bagel."}
{"text":"Fantastic bagels! They toast them just enough so the bagels are hot, but still chewy and soft when you get them. The bagels are fresh and fluffy, try one of the lunch bagel sandwiches. The place is small with a line but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"Oh the humanity of it all, that your located in Awatukee. Let me start by saying that this bagel shop is clean; that being said there is no atmosphere but who is expecting atmosphere in a bagel shop. The bagels are some of the best I've had in Phoenix and definitely worth the drive. I found the owner (I'm guessing he was the bagel man) to be polite, client orientated, and knowledgeable. If I didn't know any better I would say that the bagel man is from a small town somewhere, because memories of my childhood in the Midwest were reminiscent as we experienced all that was the bagels from the bagel man.  Mr. Bagel man all you need to do now is deliver bagels to my office in downtown phoenix and the world would be tolerable."}
{"text":"Love this spot! It gets quite busy so time is needed to stand in line but the bagels are worth it. There aren't any fancy gourmet options like Einstein's but that's what I like abt this place. The bagels are traditional, fresh and fluffy good! Desserts are from the east coast and that coffee cake!  
The staff is quite friendly and prices are def reasonable ;)"}
{"text":"I think the thing for those who don't know good bagels is that they see bagels as bread that you spread butter or cream cheese on and it may have some sort of toppings . For someone who really knows the real thing, it is so different than that. Maybe it's nostalgia for the delectable deliciousness of a semi hard exterior with a fluffy interior. Or the subtle semi salty after taste. The smear should also be of high quality. It's not Philadelphia cream cheese. A good bagel place will make their own.

The Bagel man is definitely that. This is by far the best bagel place west of the Mississippi. It honestly competes and is on par with what New York has to offer. The owner is a kind man who knows what he is doing and remembers his customers even after long absences."}
{"text":"The lightest tastiest bagel! We had an everything bagel with sliced lox and cream cheese and an cheese bagel with egg and sausage; both delicious."}
{"text":"If you're coming to The Bagel Man, I would recommend you leaving your house/work ten minutes early because of the line. There is plenty of parking within the area and tables outside for seating. Once you're done ordering, you get your food out within a jiffy HOT and good. YUM! In my opinion, lines that goes beyond the entry of any restaurant is a good sign based on the quality of the food and the loyalty of returning customers. The Bagel Man fits the quality of the food and returning customers."}
{"text":"A drive from chandler to the \"bagel man\" well worth the time. 

I actually met Cal this morning, and he showed me his bagel making operation. Can't get any fresher than this."}
{"text":"They were out of lox so I quickly decided on a bacon, egg, and cheese on onion. I was not disappointed! That sandwich was made with love"}
{"text":"Yes, they are open. 
 Major holidays, minor holidays and even Monday. 

Aside from being open they have great hand rolled bagels that are hot and fresh.  Most of the varieties are the usual suspects, but their cheese bagel has a wonderful surprise in the center as the cheese melts into the hole, and caramelizes on the bottom, it is the real treasure. They also have in house made specialty cream cheeses and a variety of sandwiches. On weekends the line can be long and slowish but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Somebody on this site recommended the toasted everything bagel with lox, tomato, and chive cream cheese, so I got that, and yup, you were right -- IT WAS GOOD!!!  To your recommendation, I say also get the capers and onions on that.  Mmm mmm. Four and a half stars."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Great food and great service. The owner Kal was there and hands-on working and making sure everyone is getting great service. After we order, he have us 3 extra bagel free..thank you! Fresh brew coffee was also so good.. definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Do you know \"The Bagel Man\"? That serves off Elliot Road?!
Best bagel hands down in PhX"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 but every time I come in for breakfast 2 hours before they close... They always sell out before they close. This place makes there bagels fresh every day, but doesn't seem to make enough for the demand.. The owner is really sweet, and the staff is great.. But there sacking on making enough bagels... When I get my hands on 1 they are amazing! Should be voted best bagels in Arizona, hands down.."}
{"text":"Arizona bagels almost always leave my heart yearning for New York City, but this bagel shop took us there and beyond! The bagels are fresh and delicious- a warm fluffy inside and a perfect toasty outside. The generous amounts of smear was homemade and flavorful. Most importantly was the man selling us bagels. He was SO sweet and friendly and put extra love into our order. It was like he took his shop in NYC and transplanted it off of Elliot. He was the bagel man! 

This will be a regular stop on our trips to Phoenix for sure. Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Best bagel I've had outside of Brooklyn. The owner is very nice and welcoming. The cream cheese is also fantastic and they make a great bagel breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Really good bagels! First time here and staff was really nice. Ended up leaving with a dozen of bagels!"}
{"text":"Another Yelp breakfast search success! Bagel Man whips up one delicious breakfast sandwich that hollers New York authenticity. The eggs, meat, and cheese bust out from the fresh and spongy bagels. There's a reason they're called Bagel Man and not Bagel Boy - this is a grown up establishment.

I came through on a Saturday morning. Craving eggs and coffee, I had searched Yelp while driving through the area. The outstanding reviews convinced me so I pulled on over. The restaurant can be a little cramped with the counter taking up most of the space. My eyes darted around the large menu behind it, covered in tasty bagel options. They've got quite the spread, and I don't mean what goes on your bagel! The smear options go for days. 

I ordered the scrambled eggs with sausage and cheese on a wheat bagel. It came out wrapped up in foil to go. The bagels are soo good. They consistency isn't bready, it's more pliable and buttery. The trick is in the boiling and baking. Very scientific. 

The store is a little warm, but the real heat is coming from their kitchen. Check out this gem of a bagel shop off the I-10/Elliot."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh bagels!!  These bagels are just as good as bagels from NYC!  Great service too.  Whenever I am in the area, I will stop by for breakfast.  Loved the bacon, egg and cheese."}
{"text":"BEST BAGELS I have had in Phoenix.  Ok, I don't know much about bagels but my roommate does.  This place not only has excellent bagels they have exceptional service.  He said the only way to tell if a bagel is good is to get the bagel of your choice with plain cream cheese.  He picked everything and since I don't much care for bread I ordered nothing.  While he waited for his bagel he asked for water the owner told him take any cup and help yourself to ice Tewa if you like.  Excellent business practice!  The bagel arrived and looked perfect, nicely toasted with a healthy helping of smear.  I took my fourth of his bagel and enjoyed every bite.  As we sat in the parking lot we decided what the heck it's practically lunch, and headed right back in for a bagel sandwich.  As we were trying to decide what to order the clerk said there was no reason to split the sandwich his half meat my half veggie because he would give me a free sandwich!  So I had the everything bagel all veggies and fresh mozzarella cheese....delish!!  He has a grilled chicken with roasted peppers, bacon and herb aoli.  Also a total win!  Now, I don't like to eat bread because it leaves me feeling sluggish but not these bagels.  I felt great and full of energy all day.  Now do I expect a free bagel every time? Nope.  But the Bagel Man has 2 new customers.  4 stars for yummy chewy, crispy outside, flavorful bagels and the extra star for over-the-top exceptional customer service.  Making plans to go back tomorrow......yum!"}
{"text":"Due to the many positive ratings here we did expect the best ! And we were not disappointed.
Delicious bagels ! Friendly service. Keep it up !"}
{"text":"Driving from UofA in Tucson to California at 7am. So glad we yelped bagel places and found this place! Friendly staff, delicious bagels and a perfect amount of cream cheese. Yum! Thanks Bagel Man!"}
{"text":"He makes the bagles fresh daily in the true New York style. I never thought I would find this when I returned to Phx from NYC. The owner was friendly and committed to the quality of his product. I shall return, again and again..."}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast sandwich like back home and this place has them!!! I loves my huge bacon,egg, and cheese on an everything bagel. Get past the decor to get a bagel,shear, or sandwich quickly!! I'll be back to try a reuben!!"}
{"text":"A little light on bagels at noon.  Stopped in randomly without looking at yelp so based on the mom and pop shop appearance I didn't know what I was going to get.  Mom and pop shops are either mediocre or awesome.  I'm happy to say bagel man is AWESOME!  I took my first bite and immediately picked up my phone to write a review.  

Then I found out yelp loves this place too.  Damn I was late to the party!  :)

Unfortunately I felt the need to dock a star as they only had 3 bagel choices at lunch time.  Maybe someone cleared them out.  I'll try again soon :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, but this is twice now that the bagels came with a little amount of cream cheese on them which beats the purpose of getting a \"bagel w/ cream cheese\". Also, not a fan of the egg bagel at all. 

Nonetheless, I will be back here time and time again because of how delicious the bagels normally are and service being great."}
{"text":"I have always had great bagels from Bagel Man, but today was something else. Today Bagel Man ran out of bagels (which rarely happens there, but hey, they only have the ability to make so much before an oven just can't keep up). I happened to get one of the last everything bagels and had it with tomato, onion, capers, cream cheese and lox. It was the most amazing bagel I have ever had, EVER! Cal is always so nice and recognizes his regulars. This place is such a gem. If you're in the area and it's not Monday (the one day they close) you must go!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect! Bagels are fluffy and delicious and right on target.  And the kicker... They have pork roll!  They make the best breakfast sandwiches and the prices will not drain your bank account."}
{"text":"Best beagles ever fresh made daily & great costumer service. Super  delicious , we are definitely coming back for more !!!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out after hearing about their awesome bagels.. The cashier was probably one of the rudest people ever and gave an older lady and gentleman such attitude, as well as his fellow co-workers.. However the bagel with scambled egg and lox was delicious! And the kid who made it felt really bad for the customer service and apologized."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous since it's right next to EOS gym.  Some days the amazing smells win out and I have to go in for a cinnamon raisin or cheese bagel. There is always several people in line and for good reasons, the Bagels are super fresh and really good.  If you really like cream cheese you'll be in heaven because you get a lot and I mean a lot. The selection of bagels is good and they offer tons of sandwich options too."}
{"text":"My being a native New Yorker means I'm qualified to make this statement. This is the best bagel spot that I've found in the valley. I may or may not be proud of it, but with every visit here I'm eating at least two bagels. Keep it up Bagel Man. You put the TEN in Gluten."}
{"text":"Water boiled bagels are the only way to go and these bagels hit the mark. I would definitely go more often if there was more of a selection at a bit more competitive price. 

We're from Santa Cruz and Scott actually used to be the baker at the Bagelry so I've had some pretty epic bagels.  In addition at the Begalry they had so many different kinds of schmeers, my favorites being hummus and egg salad on garlic.  It would also be cool if there was a nice rich sun-dried tomato schmeer."}
{"text":"Gonna make this one short and sweet. . Really like this place . The bagels are awesome and always fresh .cant go wrong going to this place. The owner is really cool and always greet me respectfully ."}
{"text":"Outstanding true NY style bagels and friendly staff. Found this place on Yelp and read nothing but great reviews and took entire family here for breakfast while on vacation. The bagels are so soft yet have a perfect little crisp/crunch to them. I got a bacon, egg, cheese bagel and it was to die for. Give The Bagel Man a try....you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First let me tell you my theory about NY bagels.  I left NYC in 1958 so my recall is of that era.  The last true bagel bakers were unable to interest their grandchildren to become bakers and the \"art\" slowly morphed from the '40s - '50s style to the 21st century, baked by non-Jewish bakers of other origins.
Yes they still boiled and then baked but were different.  Not not good or great but a new style for a new people.  We love things based on good memories and the current younger population likes their newer style of bagel, hence the great reviews that I can't agree with as I am (a long retired New Yorker longing for the bagels of yore:)  To me a bagel always has a distinct hole in it's center, a shiny, tough, and lightly crunchy rich brown crust and a chewy dense interior.  I thought that Bruegger's Bagels came close.  They are gone from our area but still in Tucson.
Bagelman's bagels taste good, they are however not what I expected and hence not a NY bagel to ME!
Their Bialy however is too dense, as their bagel is not dense enough.  
To all the young folk out there (born less than 50 years ago), you will love Bagelman's baking!!! Mr. Bagelman, keep it up, you are indeed pleasing those you need to please!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Bagel Man! Prices are just right, the bagels are delicious. Owner is always friendly. Sometimes there's a line, it moves quick and the bagels are worth it. I've never been to NY but I hear from other customers that these bagels are spot on. Get there earlier in the morning though on the weekends--if you go later than 9 or 10 am they may be out of the bagel you want. (I always make sure to have a \"backup\" bagel plan.)"}
{"text":"Bagel man makes the best bagels in the Valley.  Hands down.  Crispy, chewy circular delights that make you question the existence of places like Einsteins.  His lox and egg breakfast sandwich is about the best meal 6$ can buy in the region.  If you know better, hit me up because I want to go to there."}
{"text":"5-stars for Bagels...but if you are looking for specialty coffee blends, other assorted baked goods, or a coffee shop hangout stop with free wifi, LOOK ELSEWHERE. My rating compares these bagels to those that I have tried out of a bag at a grocery store, to chains that claim bagels should be smart, and to the only other family owned shop in the east valley that claims they know bagels for 'back east'. Bagel man bagels are exeptionally larger and pretty much consistent in their round,donut-shape, something that constantly bothers me about the competitor. Because these have a consistant round puffy shape, they might not be as dense and crusty on the outside when stored and reheated in the toaster, which is what I like to do.
Bottom line, i like the huge, round puffy shape. I also love their walnut rasin cream cheese but for me this is definitely an eat the same day bagel, which is fine with me.
This is a very basic, tiny, family owned shop that specializes in very good bagels and a few freshly made cream cheese selections. It has a counter with basic coffee and a fountain drink machine, that's all!!! Come here and rate it for the bagels only."}
{"text":"Sweet sassy molassey! These are some gooooood bagels. In fact, I think these are the best bagels I've ever had. You have to try some. They will change the way you look at breakfast breads forever!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bagel I have ever had! The owner is enthusiastic and energetic!   I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This now is my main bagel stop. Forget that high price frozen dough and microwaved egg places. The bagel man hand makes freshly dough bagels with stovetop fresh eggs. I get the bacon or ham, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel-YUM! Only problem is space; it's crowded and small."}
{"text":"Great food here, but my only complaint is that they don't write things down. I'm sure this would enhance the over customer experience because it seems like there is always confusion between the back and front. A simple marker would solve everything at this place. It would move the line faster and make it easier for literally everyone. Coming from Long Island I am a very harsh critic of egg sandwiches and bagels and can tell you that the food is great here. 

This place would be the best in the state if it wrote down orders for everyone."}
{"text":"We get bagels here every week and they never disappoint! They're always fresh, large, and so delicious you barely want to put cream cheese on them (you should though-theirs is perfect!) The coffee cake is to die for and the people who run the shop are all so friendly and kind. If you're looking for a great breakfast experience or really miss authentic bagels, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The Bagel man.... Our group was visiting AZ and I decided that I would use Yelp to find an awesome breakfast place. Well, the Bagel man came up and ... because we don't have many great bagel places in Hawaii, we jumped at the chance!
After riding our luxurious bus to the strip mall, we see \"The Bagel Man\" right in front of us!
It's PACKED!!!!!!!!!  A GOOD SIGN!
We go in and stand in line chatting excitedly and this guy bumps into me and says \"sorry\" - it's the THE Bagelman!!!!! I told everyone \"hey the Bagel man bumped into me\"!!!!!!
OK, not many bagels left - because it's close to 12 and they close at 12. Still, several options to choose from.
How did it taste? Well, it was great! Different from some other bagels I usually eat on the mainland - a little lighter with a good bite. Perhaps not as chewy, but still great! Someone else ordered a walnut bagel and it was incredible. I had the breakfast bagel and it was very good - excellent. The coffee was standard diner fare but got the job done.

The workers are FUNNY! I can't repeat what they said, but hang around and you hear funny stuff over and over!

Next time I go back, the Bagel Man will be on my list again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best bagels I've had in Phoenix!   I'm from the East Coast and LOVE bagels, but I was pretty disappointed with other places in the area until I tried The Bagel Man.  These are truly authentic tasting, felt like straight out of a deli from NY or NJ.  

I had the everything bagel with cream cheese, lox, tomato, and onion.  The bagel was absolutely delish - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside without being super thick.  This was exponentially better than Chompies and extremely well-priced.

The service was great!  I was in and out on a busy Sunday morning within a few minutes.  Also, I think it may have been the owner who waited on me, but he was so friendly and nice.  There were 2 other guys who took orders and they were also very friendly.  Great customer service.

Will definitely be back.  If you live anywhere near Ahwatukee definitely support a local business like this one."}
{"text":"These are the best bagels around by far!  If you like bagles like I do, you have got to try The Bagel Man.  Everything is great!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  So many selections without the crowd at other outstanding bagel places. This place in Ahwatukee can be hard to find just by driving tucked away with other great restaurants.  Would highly recommended to anyone who LOVES everything bagels."}
{"text":"I'm from NJ and lived in Manhattan for a while. One of the things I really wanted to find was a great bagel place that scratched that East coast itch. This place definitely has the nice outer crust gloss with a great soft chew in the middle like the bagels in NJ and NY. Get there earlier because some of the flavors run out on the weekend. We got a bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything along with cream cheese and a dozen. The egg was fried, not scrambled and everything tasted as it should! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best bagel place I've ever been to. The owner is super nice and the bagels and cheese are both fresh. Nothing else compares to this."}
{"text":"OMG!  where to start... This place has amazing from scratch homemade bagels and cream cheeses and is a local mom-and-pop business.  You must try their breakfast bagel sandwiches, they are to live for!  My favorite is the toasted cinnamon raisin bagel with egg bacon cheddar cheese and honey maple raisin nut cream cheese on the side."}
{"text":"I was transported to a morning on the island. Long Island, that is! I had the lox sandwich on an onion bialy which includes cream cheese, tomato, red onion, and capers. It was perfect! Service was super friendly and the workers were so welcoming! Love it!"}
{"text":"I hopped on my Yelp app looking for a place nearby my work where I could grab a quick sandwich and I found the Sub Factory.  As I pulled into the parking spot, I noticed the Bagel Man right next door with a Boars Head sign in the window.  No contest.  I love Boars Head so I decided to go there instead.  From the outside, it doesn't look like much, it doesn't look like much from the inside either - small and no attention to the décor at all.  An incredibly friendly gentleman greeted me and he could immediately tell it was my first time there.  I told him I wanted a turkey sandwich with mozzarella and while trying to decide on what type of bread I wanted, he suggested I eat it on a bagel, he said that I can't find bagels like that anywhere else and promised me that this wouldn't be my last visit to his bagel shop.  I found him irresistible, it may have been the accent combined with the fact that I had just returned home from NYC where these little bagel shops owned by foreigners are in abundance.  Since it was late in the day, already past 2:00 by the time I was able to break away from work, the bagel options were slim so I settled on a salt bagel which I had never had before.  When I got back to my office and started eating my sandwich I realized that he was right, the bagel was delicious and he made a patron out of me.  I've been back four times and I get the same amazing service each time and I haven't veered from the salt bagel yet, it's so delicious.  When my dad wanted to meet me for breakfast we met here and he thought it was a great little bagel shop, too.  Next time there is a morning meeting at work, we're ordering from this place, forget Einstein's!"}
{"text":"I love this man.  The bagel man.  He is incredibly friendly, efficient and makes a HELLUVA bagel.  I've tried almost everything here, since it's in my hood, and the only complaint I have is that they're too busy in the mornings to take phone orders!  

The first time I stopped in, I paid for my meal and he looked at me and said \"you'll be back\"... he was right, but I didn't think it would be the next morning!  

It's nice when small businesses like this GET IT - and are able to consistently crank out a quality product within their niche.  Clearly his recipes are spot on, for the bagels and the schmear which are made fresh daily.

If you like bagels, or breakfast, or really personable small business owners, come here - you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"The best bagels and chive smear! The owner makes you feel like family and all other associates are always so friendly and helpful. I always recommend this place and literally the best everything begal you will ever find!"}
{"text":"I'm no bagel expert or connoisseur by any means; all I know is that the lox and cream cheese bagel is delicious every time I have it here. Price is fair, line is quick, and I always leave satisfied. There's nothing overly fancy or amazing that warrants five stars but I can't find any reason not to give it five stars either at this point."}
{"text":"So delicious fresh bagels makes food right on the spot"}
{"text":"I don't know what changed here but the service issues have been 'highly improved'. Keep it up bagel man!"}
{"text":"\"The  Bagel Man\" opened his shop a little over a year ago and I have always wanted to stop in and see what it is all about.  I do a lot of traveling and I always look forward to enjoying a fresh bagel whenever I get to the east coast.  Authentic New York Bagels are very hard to find on the west coast.  This morning I was out and about and decided to stop in and pick up some bagels to share.

The Bagel Man greeted me as soon as I walked in the door and cheerfully asked if I had been in before.  I smiled and said no.  As I was giving him my order.  I asked him if he made the bagels on the premises; he cheerfully said yes and I told him I was excited to give them a try.  He said that I would be back!  He told me how he prepared them and I told him that I realy enjoyed the bagles in New York; he said I would be happy I found the shop!

He was right!  The bagels are perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with wonderful flavor.  When I bite into one I can see the Statue of Liberty through the misty haze...

...anyway The Bagel Man is highly recommened and you won't be disappionted!"}
{"text":"Best bagels I've ever had. Before this place I thought I knew what bagels were about, but I was so wrong. I can't reccomend this place enough. Be sure to get their early though, they have quite a fan base"}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I came here for the first time this morning. It was soooo good! The bagels were fresh and the cream cheese was very tasty! I got the sausage, egg, and cheese (with a side of jalapeno cream cheese) it was very good. I just wished they had a complete list of all the types of cream cheese they have, maybe they do and I missed it. The place is very small. We were going to eat there but there was no place to sit and it was very hot in there. But, I am not complaining. I am just saying it was a small place. They people there are very nice and friendly. We will be going back for sure...soon. :)"}
{"text":"I'm originally from jersey and the one thing I miss is a good jersey bagel no where has ever held up to the standards of what I grew up on thus far here in arizona. I stopped in today after hearing about this place and doing some research. The owner is the sweetest, nicest man ever as I told him how excited I was to try a bagel. To say the least he hit it out of the park. His bagels are exactly what a jersey bagel should be and I will definitely be going back and recommending it to anyone that asks for a good bagel. Keep up the great work and I'll be seeing you again soon!"}
{"text":"As a New Jersey bagel snob, this 5star review does not come lightly.  Not only are the bagels seriously delicious, warm with just the right balance of fluffy and doughy, the staff are like family. Every time I come in (hungover or poppin fresh) I'm always greeted with a smile and the guys behind the counter do everything to make my order perfect. AND THEY HAVE PORK ROLL! Anyone from New Jersey knows that this is a serious win. TEN STARS. ALL the stars!!!"}
{"text":"If you're like me, a New Yorker, we all crave a taste of NYC..... you will simply not taste a better bagel in all of Phoenix. AND I assure you, I have tried everyone's bagels in this town.

For all of you that think it is only the water of NYC that makes a good bagel..... you're wrong. This bagel man makes a bagel to die for.  Just get there in the moring when the bagels are fresh. if you get there between 7 am and 9 am, you will be in for a real NYC treat. AND his veggie cream cheese is also magic."}
{"text":"Sooo good! This is my first visit here. I went close to closing time so they were almost out of everything. I ordered the chicken melt and it was delicious! Order macaroni salad with it. I would defiantly come back I would just get there earlier!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best experiences I have had in recent memory.  Not only were the bagels superb (I got the bacon, egg, & cheese on everything) but the service and friendliness of \"Mr. Bagel\" were top-notch.  If you like NY-style soft bagels, do yourself a favor and go here.  Wish this was in DC!!  I will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out and glad we did! Yummie fresh bagels and homemade cream cheese! We both got breakfast sandwiches one with sausage and one with bacon, everything was quick and super tasty. The owner and the staff were all very friendly and worked quickly to get our order in. The line was sort of long, but the wait went by extremely quick. If you want a fresh yummie bagel I would highly recommend checking this place out plus I feel it's hard to find places these days with great customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Just like the shops in NY and NJ.  Same quality Bagels.  They are boiled here, not just baked bread like the other places.  If you have not tried it you must."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never rated this place. I've been coming here for years. These are the BEST bagels in Phoenix. The outsides are tough but the insides are soft and chewy. The service is amazing. They remember regulars and what they order. You can get a breakfast sandwich and a coffee for $6.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out because the reviews on Yelp were really good, and The Bagel Man did not disappoint. I'm not kidding when I say these are the best bagels I've ever had. It sounds silly, but they're seriously so good! You can tell they are made fresh. The service is so nice and genuine. This is the best hole-in-the-wall breakfast place."}
{"text":"All I can say is that my experience with bagels up to this point has been just absolutely sad. Now that I know how delicious a freshly made bagel can be I am forever changed. My husband and I recently moved from California to Texas and we have had to make two road trips in the span of 2 months to get all of our crap moved. We made a point to stop at this place both times instead of taking the Phoenix Bypass that would save us time on our trip. The food is THAT good here. I love their cheese bagel with the scallion cream cheese spread. My husband has gotten two different bagel sandwiches. Both were delicious. The service is really great here too. The owner is a really friendly dude that seems to genuinely care about his customers. I am really sad that we don't live closer to this place, but you best believe we will stop by on any future road trips. It's probably also a good thing that I don't live too close to this place because I would probably eat their bagels uncontrollably every day if I did!"}
{"text":"I've stopped cooking breakfast on the weekends because of this place. The saugage, egg, and cheese; the new york reuben; the scallion schmear; the lox, everything's been fantastic so far. There's been a sizable line every time I've been in, but they keep things moving. Friendly service; fantastic food. If you're in the area, treat yourself."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I have time to breakfast in the mornings.  I think the word \"authentic\" is thrown around way too often in Yelp reviews and I am guilty of using too often too . . . so please forgive me for using one more time; The Bagel Man has authentic NYC bagels and frankly, if they weren't they are still amazing.

Meal:  Just pick anything off of the menu.  Don't think . . .just choose.  It will be well worth it.  I recommend that you don't taste the bagel because it ruins the taste, but that is just my preference. 

Taste:  These bagels are the cat's pajamas.  While the sandwiches are terrific, I recommend keeping it simple and just stick with the bagels.  10 out of 10.

Value: You can maybe go somewhere else and find cheaper bagels, but they are exactly just that, cheaper bagels.  The quality of these bagels could demand almost any price but they are reasonably priced. 4 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  The Bagel Man has to be the nicest man in the food business in the East Valley.  He always greets you with a smile.  He loves to interact with the customers . . .but his supporting staff lately has dropped the ball.  The last time I was there, one of his employees begun to take my order and walked away mid-way.  She went to the back and after waiting for a few minutes, I just left. 6 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  It was it is - its a bagel place and I don't thing there really needs to be anything else, right?  3 out of 5.

Overall:  I feel there service has really gone down lately.  If every employee there was just like he Bagel Man himself, this place would be an easy 5 star place!  23 out of 30 points, 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have lived on the east coast my entire life until I relocated here 2 years ago. I had given up on finding the bagels I craved so much out here in the desert...until now! This is the real east coast deal my friends...all is good in my world now.  Just like home w/out the snow & cold. :)"}
{"text":"I saw the review for this place in my email and went right over. The bagels were just coming out of the oven....could smelll them the whole way home....got bagels with cream cheese...OMG! The bagels & the cream cheese were delicious!! Ive been looking for a place like this in AZ forever!!! YOU GOTTA TRY IT!"}
{"text":"So, I hobbled my broken-footed rear-end into this place after getting a couple of amazing deliveries through door-dash. The place is TINY and it was getting pretty hot in there but, with the exception of the heat, I felt like I was time machined back to when I worked at JFK airport and it was my turn to pick up our regular order of bagels from the tiny shop just downstairs from our office.  You could almost say this guy is like a \"Bagel Nazi\" in the most complementary way but I think he's more like a \"Bagel Whisperer.\"  He creates work-of-art bagels and has to train the uneducated customers.  In front of me, a guy with the whole-arm tattoos and a forward-facing Coyotes cap read off his orders (no orders are \"taken\" they are just spoken and relayed to the back kitchen).  He read, \"One everything bagel with the bread dug out.\"  The owner first just looked at him like he was speaking a foreign language, and then said, \"Why would you wanna do that?\"  The Coyote fan said, \"It's for my mother in law.\"  The bagel man had a serious look of disdain on his face and said very little after that.  The next guy had a little kid with him and said, \"One toasted plain bagel with cream cheese...\" and the Owner interrupted, \"These bagels are very hot, you don't need to toast them.\"  The guy was about to speak again and he said, \"TRUST me.\"  I had to speak up, \"Trust him,\" I said.  

These bagels brought me back to those days in Queens when the bagels were so fresh that the idea of toasting them was,sacrilege.   While I was waiting a good 20 minutes in line, all but three types of bagels were sold out and two pans came out to replace two types.  I'm sure this seems like a bad thing to some people but when I see bagels being brought out and being sold out constantly, I know that whatever I end up with is going to be insanely good.  Go  here!  And try read-up on and respect,  \"Bageletiquette.\""}
{"text":"Good bagels for Phoenix. Much better than Einstein's or Chompies."}
{"text":"Love the Bagel Man - although some of the kids he has making the sandwiches can be slooooooooooooow, the food is tasty and the bagels are the perfect amount of crusty outside and tender inside that makes me miss NYC some kinda bad.  My husband and the owner chat about New York every time he goes in there, reminding us that there's more to life than grab your food and go - this is a neighborhood joint and repeat visitors are remembered and appreciated.

Although we typically go there for bagels and bialys (they run out QUICK!), the sandwiches are killer as well, particularly the Reuben.  The place is pretty small and in a nondescript shopping center on Elliott, so you'll probably want to grab your food and go.  Perfect for mornings when you want breakfast in a hurry and fast food joints aren't on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm an everything bagel kinda guys and heck if you're into it go for the lox with the Worx.  

This is the best bagel in Phoenix.

-New Yorker"}
{"text":"Best bagels outside new York or jersey. Great job bagel man!!!"}
{"text":"Just like Jersey bagels!
Love that I can get my old favorite, Salt Bagel with Veggie Cream cheese.
I took a star off for not having Light CC and the drink selections are pretty lame."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The bagels are so soft, even after they are toasted.  We usually get the egg, bacon and cheese on onion or jalapeno and they are delicious.  The service is always prompt and the guy that is always at the counter (I'm assuming he is the owner) knows tons of people that come in by name and he is always friendly.  I've been to other bagel places at 10am on a Saturday, and they are all out of the good bagels for the day.  That never happens at The Bagel Man.  They have a good selection throughout the day and replace flavors as they run out."}
{"text":"The owner is very passionate about his bagel's-- and cou van taste the difference.  My husband and I love getting everything bagels with bacon, egg, and cheese.  The restaurant is small and not very atmospheric, but the breakfast food is great & served quickly."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town - hands down!! Friendly owner is very welcoming and accommodating. Atmosphere is NOT why you go here so don't be turned off by the aesthetics; you're there for the food, which is top notch."}
{"text":"Been here before to get bagels for a customer. They are as close as you can get of the New York style ones, which I had once. They are really busy in the morning but always have a good number of fresh bagels. The owner of the place is usually helping customers."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since this place has opened and it is DELISH. The Bagel Man makes the bagels fresh every morning. He uses Boar's Head meats mmmm. I love this place."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food is the outstanding customer service. The people behind the counter are so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is not just the amazing bagels and everything else that goes on the bagels, but the people who give you your food look so happy doing it. The first time i was there, a girl helped me find what i wanted (bagel and lox) and i got excited when she said it had chickapeas. she ended up giving me a little extra and that's what got me to come back."}
{"text":"Stuck in a nondescript strip mall in Ahwatukee is one of the biggest surprises you will find. Are you from back East or the Midwest? Do you miss real bagels so much that when you visit home and the first thing you do is run out and buy a real bagel?  Well, the wait is over. Real bagels straight from the East are here!  

No more bread rolls shaped like bagels. Try any of these and you will know that you are dealing with a pro. Kal, the owner, owns a bagel shop back in New Jersey. This place is worth the drive. The owner is awesome. Visit this place and you cannot go wrong. 

And if you think that Einstein's brothers offers a real bagel come and check this place out and find out what you've been missing for all these years!"}
{"text":"What a delightful visit today to the Bagelman. You can tell how much this guy loves to be in business! It's not often you can tell the passion for food and appreciation one has for their customers, but here at bagelman, the owner beams with pride and gratitude. 

As a customer raved about her lox, I sampled the tuna, relieved that it did not contain chunks of celery. I hate that! Ordered a Ruben on a bagel for my husband, but  ate half before I even got out of my parking spot!.

So much value for what I paid for a ruben, and 1/2 lb tuna. I'll never go anywhere else! Feels like home for this New Yorker! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Okay so easily the best bagels in the valley! Seriously the bagels are top notch! Five star worthy!

However I have to rate it a bit lower because of the service. It seems like anytime I go there and the actual Bagel Man(the owner) isn't there the service is absolute crap... 
This morning we went and the Bagel Man wasn't there.  We ordered five bagels toasted with cream cheese. Pretty easy right? Well we ended up with only four, and on two of them there wasn't even enough cream cheese to spread around. I am sure they would have corrected it, but we were traveling for the day. We didn't discover it until later down the road. 
My moral of the story: check your stuff before you go, and don't count it being right the Bagel Man himself isn't there. 

Again I can't express how good the bagels are. They are simply the best!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bagels!

I want to give this place 5 stars, based on the bagels, but my experience there was a little off, so I'm reserving it at 4 for now.

I had a strong craving for a bagel sandwich one day at work, so I decided to check out this place. I walked in and wasn't overly impressed with the place. It's a little run down and not the cleanest place. It's a small place, with only a couple of tables (but there aren't many people sitting down to eat here, I suppose). I came around 12:30 or 1:00 in the afternoon, and I immediately noticed there were not many bagels left in the racks. The group before me got the last of a couple different varieties of bagels, so I was pretty limited with my options.

I was thinking breakfast bagel sandwich, but I ended up going with one of the lunch sandwiches instead. Cinnamon raisin was the best of the remaining options, in my opinion, so I went with it. It was perhaps an odd combination with the red peppers and turkey on my sandwich, but oh well. When I got my sandwich, the bagel had been perfectly toasted. The texture was great! A little crunch on the outside, and nice and tender on the inside. This bagel truly was great. The sandwich toppings were decent, but as it should be at a bagel shop, the bagel was by far the star of the show. I'm definitely going to come back for more, and I may just do that cinnamon raisin bagel again for a sandwich, because it really was good.

I definitely will be back for a breakfast sandwich. There is little better for breakfast than a nice bagel sandwich. And with these bagels, I can only imagine...

The service was friendly, but spotty. When I ordered from the cashier, he kept gazing off in different directions and seemingly forgetting what he was doing. He definitely seemed distracted. I had to remind another of the guys of what I had ordered a couple of times. But in the end, I got what I ordered, and it was great.

Had I had more bagel options and the service been better, this place is a 5. I'll give it another chance in the future.

Thanks, Bagel Man!"}
{"text":"We live in Gilbert and made the 25 minute trek to The Bagel Man and it was worth it, you won't be disappoint the best bagels in the valley and the homemade cream cheese is awesome!"}
{"text":"Just had \"The Rich and Famous\" on an everything bagel. The everything bagel = life. That is all."}
{"text":"I saw this place on yelp and had very high expectations for a quality bagel place that beats out Einstein Bagels.. This place definitively exceeded expectations!

The bagels were so soft and moist and flavorful and on top of that the customer service was excellent. The cook gave us a mini tour in the back where they boil the bagels in house fresh before baking them! 

I ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese and a small coffee and my boyfriend got a cheese bagel with butter. Both of us ate for under 7 bucks and we left with full happy tummys :)"}
{"text":"Been traveling for 6 hours. We were hungry for breakfast, but didn't want fast food. IHOP also didn't have a great rating so luckily we found this place.

Had a great breakfast bagel sandwich. It was and very satisfying.

The line was out the door, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Freshest bagels in the valley. Worth the drive to south Phoenix! Reminds me of a New York deli, it's busy, and delicious."}
{"text":"Great bagels, great sandwiches and nice staff.  But get in early cause they will often sell out."}
{"text":"1st time here and I'm very impressed! Authentic NY style bagels that are moist and delicious! I was born on the east coast and my family lives there, so I'm very particular about foods like bagels, pizza, soft pretzels, and seafood. Not just any will do! This east coast girl (at heart) approves. I got a traditional bagel and lox and it was so good! And HUGE! I had to take half home.

And the customer service is great as well. I was greeted promptly and warmly. They made me feel as if I had been coming in for years. They also seemed to know all their customers that came in. I love to see that. 

My only negative comment is that it was so hot in there!

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best bagels EVER!  I go in every Friday morning, everything is so fresh and the owner / employees are so friendly ?"}
{"text":"Great bagels and so nice! Get 'em to go because dining room is warm. The veggie cream cheese is delicious! The whole wheat bagel was yummy and my kids adored the plain with cream cheese!"}
{"text":"Simply the best bagel in the east valley and possibly the entire valley. Chewy, with a wonderful crunchy shell. The everything bagel toasted with scallion cream cheese is perfection."}
{"text":"If I were just talking bagels here we'd be at a 5 star. This place has some of the tastiest bagels I've come across here in the valley and they are all made fresh on premises using the old NY boil and bake. The Bagel Man himself seems to be working as a jack of all trades up front serving customer and working the bakery. 

I was pretty impressed that the selection of bagels included some classics like salt (my favorite) and pumpernickel rye along with some unusual recipes including walnut multi grain (will be trying this) and chocolate chip. 

My gourmet lunch sandwich ingredients couldn't really improve upon the perfectly cooked salt bagel they were placed upon. The sandwiches are piled with quality deli meats and cheeses and the 'gourmet list' included a choice of macaroni salad, chips or potato salad all for $5.50. I tried the macaroni salad, which was the  and it was very okay, also heavy on the mayo and light on flavor.

I am pretty happy to have another friendly option for breakfast around the office and will back for more salt bagels as well as to try the lox soon."}
{"text":"Damn. Flew in from Detroit pretty much just for these bagels. They were unreal and I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode."}
{"text":"Headed out on a business trip and didn't have enough time to make breakfast so I looked up
some local shops that made breakfast foods.

Line for this place was long which is typically a good indicator that it's good. Line moves extreme quick to my surprise and I ordered the sausage egg and cheese on a raisin bagel.

Not only was it ready in less than 5 minutes but it also was still warm 25 minutes after getting to my destination where I could sit down and eat it.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because they don't allow you to place phone orders. 

Other than that I recommend you give this place a try as their food is on point!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bagel as good as the everything bagel here! This is such a nice place, kinda hidden away in the corner of a strip mall in an old Baskin-Robbins."}
{"text":"Seriously the best bagels I've ever had. My husband and I love this place. We took the kids and fed all 4 of us (with drinks) for $20.00. My favorite is the bacon, egg, and cheese on a cinnamon raisin bagel. The coffee is great too. We've moved now but we'll still make the drive because this place is amazing."}
{"text":"The Bagel Man has certainly earned that title and easily at that. The attention to detail of his craft is second to none in the entire state of Arizona. Hands-down the best bagel sandwich I have ever had in AZ. 
I ordered the bacon, sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on a pumpernickel rye bagel. Yes, pumpernickel rye. Not the average bagel, this one was expertly crafted and baked to perfection. The sausage was flavorful and of great quality. The bacon is thick and crispy with incredible flavor that's apparent in every bite, not that soggy \"bacon\" that's served at other places. This bacon was hearty. It's easy to tell that they use real cheese and they have high quality meats. The cheese was thick and melted into everything that was in the bagel. The eggs were just right, not too greasy, not too salty. Everything in the sand which was just perfect. As I said, best bagel sandwich in AZ.
The coffee is piping hot, just the way I like it. Not extra bold... smooth flavor but still certainly delivers that \"kick\" that is needed in the morning!
Definitely coming back to try the Lox on an Onion Bialy bagel and after that I must explore their lunch menu. Well deserved Five Stars for the best bagel sandwich in AZ!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best in AZ! I had the everthing bagel with lox cream cheese and it was fantastic. I have never had a lox spread but it might be better than a regular lox (less of a struggle to eat). The owner was very friendly and seemed to know a lot of the other customers by name which isn't surprising because after one visit you will definitely become a regular!"}
{"text":"I love the bagel man, my family comes from the east coast and we always love the breakfast sandwiches there. This is the best bagel shop in Arizona. I've lived here for 25 years and I love eating, trust me."}
{"text":"Bagel Man, you rock! I've visited this place two times now, and I have been very pleased each time. The bagels are super authentic, the real deal. Chewy, flavorful and totally fresh. The Bagel Man himself has been behind the counter on both of my visits, and he's super friendly. He bakes and boils the bagels himself and the quality shows. On my first visit a few months ago, I ordered the Sexy sandwich on a pumpernickel bagel (my favorite!), which if I recall, was a sandwich wiith turkey, havarti and roasted red peppers among other things. I got a combo which included a drink and a side, I chose the plain Wise potato chips. It was all tasty and fresh. On my second visit, I just went with a toasted pumpernickel with cream cheese and an untoasted everything bagel to go. I also noticed the big black and white cookies in the pastry case, so I had to throw one of those in as well. The bagels were top notch as usual, and the black and white cookie was good too. I'd never had one before but immediately thought of Seinfeld when I saw it. These cookies are more akin to half of a whoopie pie (very cake-like) iced in simple vanilla and chocolate frostings. I didn't ask if they were made in-house, but they may be. My one and only gripe about the place is the ambiance. It's in a strip mall so my expectations weren't that high but it would go a long way in increasing the inviting nature of the place if they had some music playing. All in all, if you're looking for authentic, chewy bagels, look no further than the Bagel Man!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mom and Pops bagel shop. The bagels are so fresh and the customer service is great!"}
{"text":"First time here while I'm in the area pet sitting. The owner and staff are super friendly and our breakfast bagel sandwiches were fresh, hot and delicious. Good coffee too. I will be visiting here from the North valley for sure. My husband and I are the only ones eating in as everyone else has been to go. Tomorrow I'm looking forward to the honey walnut raisin cream cheese on a cinnamon raisin bagel.  I really enjoy the simple decor and old school vibe."}
{"text":"I'm from NY and this place is right up there with a good old NYC bagel with a schmear!  It's a taste of home, quick & easy, super friendly, and not expensive at all. Thank you Bagel Man for knowing what life is"}
{"text":"Delicious! Friendly owner and staff, great breakfast sandwich on a great bagel. I'll be back, as the owner promised I would."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a whim. Bagels and cream cheese are fantastic, staff are pleasant, will be coming here again."}
{"text":"By far the BEST bagels in the area.  The owner is a native NY (actually NJ).  He flies in his crumb cake in from a NJ bakery - it is Delish.   Great breakfast choices and sandwiches for lunch.  Worth the short wait in line.  Update on 8/30/15:  still delish!  I am getting a little frustrated that during my last three visits I have had issues with my order being correct.  I had them at 5 stars but took one away."}
{"text":"Great quality bagels and lunch meat! Love that they put oregano on the lunch bagels and are always so kind to give me extra. Delicious place to eat!!"}
{"text":"My coworker brought in bagels and cream cheese from this place today. Oh My Goodness! The bagels were so fresh! They were still warm from being made and the bagel itself was a big portion. Everyone in the office was in awe with these bagels. There were two types of cream cheese: Veggie and lox. I had never tried lox before today and am now in love. It does not have a super strong smoked taste which is good. The veggie is also delicious and actually has veggie chunks including carrots and cucumbers. The egg bagel was fabulous. I can't wait to go to the location and check out more menu items."}
{"text":"I drove really far to try these because of the reviews hoping for a bagel like back home. Sorry. Not even close. They are more like real bagels than supermarkets or Einstein, but alas, not as good as the worst NY or NJ bagel place. Chompies is better but only slightly."}
{"text":"Best Bagels in the world. Add butter and cream cheese increases the cost. Fresh and hot every morning."}
{"text":"Best bagel I've ever had. Amazing how the dough is so springy, yet no sign of that glue texture one can end up with in a bagel. Made to perfection. I was too busy eating mine to snap a photo, but that hole in the middle? It doesn't exist because they don't skimp."}
{"text":"More of a to go type place.  Limited seating inside and out. Staff was friendly and helpful.  I got a bagel chicken sandwich.  Think I might have been happier with just bagel with cream cheese but still good!"}
{"text":"great bagels
good crumb cake, but too much powdered sugar drowning out the crumbs
friendly service
the owner is from NJ
Black and White cookies imported from Brooklyn"}
{"text":"These bagels are great! Its been awhile since some thing tasted like NY,but this guy has got it going on.Breakfast sammie's are fantastic.Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a quick breakfast here, tried to call in but they don't do phone orders which is a bummer but still decided to give em a shot.  

Ordered a sausage, egg, & cheese on a honey wheat bagel. 

Employees are friendly, was a good breakfast sandwich. Don't think you could go wrong with a breakfast sandwich though. But fast service was a plus esp since you can't order ahead. 

Good choice for a quick on the go breakfast"}
{"text":"This is a very nice little bagel shop and Cal is a very sweet man who cares about his customers. The food is good, not great, but is a nice place to go and get a bagel in the AM."}
{"text":"The bagels are good an i would go back but the best bagels in Phoenix is back east bagel are great southern an Mc Clintock  and better price as well for a baker dozen ..  Chompies are good too an little cheaper if you order butter  bagel an if you go Weds you get 18 bagels for the price of a baker dozen.But i still go to the bagel man because it's closed to where i live."}
{"text":"This was the best bagel I've had all year.And for a plus the workers were so kind. That's the reason that it's the best ever bagel"}
{"text":"Best bagels in Phoenix! Delicious, fast and friendly service. I've had several different items from the menu but what prompted me to write this lovely review is the bagel I just had for breakfast which is a plain bagel toasted w/ veggie spread! I love this place."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and staff.  I got a bagel sandwich and it tasted good, but wasn't my favorite.  This spot does seem pretty popular, though!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New York. These are the best bagels I have ever had. It feels like New York inside The Bagel Man. I love it."}
{"text":"Used to live in NYC and I miss the bagels more than anything! This shop definitely has that Brooklyn feel to it, the bagels were flavorful and the cream cheese was the perfect consistency. We've tried a few other places and this one seems to hit the Saturday morning bagel craving the best :)"}
{"text":"The bagels are always fresh, I didn't even know bagels could taste so good. Often times they are so warm I don't even get my blueberry bagel toasted. 
The sandwiches are soooo good..."}
{"text":"I love small little local shops like this one!! All the staff was very friendly and asked us a couple times how everything was. They had great variety and the bagels were being baked fresh as we waiting for our food. I had the bagel with lox and cream cheese and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"These people are from new jersey, like me, and are the only authentic bagel place in the valley. They never overload their bagels with cream cheese and their price for lox and cream cheese is the lowest in town! Even after being frozen these bagels still maintain a crunchy outside and soft inside. They never taste dense or heavy, these are 1 of a kind.  It's a cozy small family operated place go and will not be disappointed!  Just listen to all the compliments you'll hear during EVERY visit.  You'll see why the Bagel Man is the man, OPEN EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR."}
{"text":"The bagels are great. Small place, Boars Head meats and plenty of it on my sandwich"}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Bagel Man since he first opened and they are the Bagels I ever ate. The bagels are boiled and then baked to perfect soft chewy inside and crunchy on the outside. I love the everything bagel  as it has the perfect balance  of salt, garlic onion, poppy and sesame seed.  
The lines can get long at times and confusion happens with the orders at times  and I overlook it as it's part of the Bagel Man experience."}
{"text":"Very good soft bagels!  Owner a little ill mannered though but still enjoyed the bagel schmear."}
{"text":"For all you NYC bagel brats out there, this is your new favorite place! I never thought that I would be able to find bagels that even compare to those in NY, but The Bagel Man delivers. They often have a line out the door but are so quick. Coffee and breakfast for two is about $10. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, schmear oozing out the sides, and sliced down the middle. Reminds me of my favorite city!"}
{"text":"I cant believe this place has been open since 2000! The best giant bagels in Az! The last time I had a Real Bagel was in NYC and this place is better! THEY HAVE THE BEST SALT BAGLE AND FRESH CREAM CHEESE!! 
It was my first visit, but no way I'm going anywhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Much to my surprise, this was one of the two best bagels I have ever eaten, out of probably thousands all over the U.S.  Perfect combination of crunchy crust and chewy interior.  
Obviously impeccably boiled.

(The other one was at the Bagel Snack in Pompano Beach, FL)"}
{"text":"I guess I have to leave a long ass review? but why he's from New York City and he makes bagels end of story. This is the best damn bagels in the valley go get you some I just get everything bagel toasted with cream cheese and egg when I used to eat meat I use to get bacon or sausage used to go to everyday when I was pregnant. I don't see how people waste their money at Einsteins bagel. Man I would die for a bagel right now with some coffee, reminds me of when I was in New York City."}
{"text":"There really isn't much to be said that hasn't already, but in case you are on the fence GO!  The best bagels of my life.  Personal favorite is the salt bagel, grab it on the morning while they are fresh and warm.  I can't encourage you enough to run to the bagel man, and get an extra dozen for everyone you love."}
{"text":"Now this is a real Bagel!  I love this spot...home grown NYC style, fresh, lots of cream cheese, no skimping here.   Owner is a cool guy and remembers you everytime.  Stop going to the chains and support the local man.  Regardless it's better then any other corporate joint...Trust me!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the shopping center the other day and I almost didn't go in because the business is somewhat nondescript.  I'm so glad that I did, I couldn't believe what I was eating.  I've just come back from NYC and I thought I wouldn't find that taste again until my next trip back.  I absolutely love his bagels.  Crusty on the outside and so soft and perfect on the inside.  

I've been back three times in the last week and I am in love!  Kal is such a friendly guy and he is unguarded and warm, a real pleasure to talk with.  I've just moved to the valley and I am so glad there is an amazing bagel shop here.  Phoenix just got great!"}
{"text":"By far the best bagel I have ever had! This man is the real deal! Genuinely cares about his business and his product. You will not find a better bagel in the state of Arizona! In most cases, the bagels do not even need to be toasted because they are so warm and fresh! My favorite is the jalapeño bagel with garden veggie cream cheese! Thank you bagel man!"}
{"text":"Do you want the best bagel in The Valley? Well I found it for you and now you can reap the benefits. After living in Phoenix for almost two decades I have officially found a round piece of dough with a hole in the middle that deserves to be called a BAGEL. For many years I could only get my bagel fix when traveling back to New York to visit friends or family. But now finally I have found a shop in Phoenix that has not only the proper taste but also the proper texture/consistency of a New York bagel. Don't bother with other imposters claiming to have \"New York style bagels.\"  This is the only real deal in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"Hearty bagels NY/NJ style. Tried the cinnamon raisin which was toasted and loaded with honey walnut cream cheese . Tasted divine but was too much for one person. The place could get a little clean up but it attracts more of a fast moving regular crowd who come in for their morning breakfast bagel and don't care about the ambience or place! It's a good stop to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"LOVE the \"Sexy\" sandwich. Always nice people! REally good bialy!"}
{"text":"Got bagels to go to eat back at our hotel. Only one order out of the four ordered were correct. Immediate fail in our book."}
{"text":"Not impressed. This was my first and last visit here. From the moment I walked in was not good. Two separate entrance people unsure of where to form the lines or where to order. Ordered a lightly toasted chicken salad sandwich and got it home and found it burned (so much I couldn't eat it) with barely a bite of chicken in it.  Paid way to much."}
{"text":"great bagels...crunchie on the outside (without toasting), soft on the inside.  Friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"Best bagels I've had outside of New Jersey hands down. Took me a few years to discover this place and I'm glad I did. They know how to do it right. They also are the only ones I've seen with taylor ham (aka pork roll) out side of Jersery."}
{"text":"Friendly staff & service (Jersey represent!). I ordered the scrambled egg, smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, red onions on a whole wheat toast. My fiance ordered the chicken cutlet, mozzarella, roasted red peppers on a bagel. Both were delicious and reasonably priced. Can't wait to come back when I'm back in AZ!"}
{"text":"This place gets you in and out quick.  The bagels are very soft and they had many choices to choose from. The prices were pretty good for what you get.  They wrap it in tin foil which is nice when getting to-go. I ate my bagel sandwich 30 minutes later and it was still hot.  The Bagel Man is friendly. I don't understand why are there so many haters. Maybe people need to be more friendly and he will reciprocate.  The cook was very nice and accommodating. I have to give this place a 5 star review based on my experience which was perfect.  I suggest giving it a try once at least. Hopefully you catch the Bagel Man on a good day like I did apparently."}
{"text":"Very good bagel sandwiches! My husband had a breakfast sandwich and I had a turkey on jalapeño.  The staff was very friendly and recommended some great food. We took 2 to go because it was so good!"}
{"text":"This place is just great. Cant even compare it to places like Einsteins. It's just far superior. And the prices are on point. Visit here, u won't be disappointed. Lox on bagel is awesome and what you get is excellent for the price!"}
{"text":"The bagels are yummy and service is quick but when you are at check-out DO NOT forget to buy the coffee cake. It is the best coffee cake I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"I wanted to love these bagels, and give this place 5 stars, but I simply can't. Here's why: both bagels I tasted were seriously under-baked. Not a little under-baked, but squeeze-the-bread-just-little-and-it-turns-back-into-dough, under-baked. I can't give any higher than 3 stars for that baking faux pas. I get that they are turning out bagels quickly, but they needed to give them another good 10-12 minutes in the oven, minimum. Make the customers wait for quality. 

The flavor, however, was excellent. The salt bagel had the perfect amount of salt without making me feel like a blowfish, and the jalapeño bagel was jam-packed full of jalapeño flavor. You can also tell they use the boiling technique which makes them a chewy texture. If only they had been baked well! 

I did not get a sandwich, or even cream cheese, since I wanted to see if these are truly NY-style. They are...except for that one thing I mentioned 120 times. 

Maybe a bad day for the Bagel Man. I probably won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Visiting out here in Phoenix and came to Bagel Man two days in a row. Had the sausage, egg, and cheese on plain bagel while hubby had lox over onion bagel. Super delish. Now that I'm back in Cali, my mouth is watering just thinking about this place. Good deal on bagels alone too!"}
{"text":"I think this may be hands down, the best bagel I've had in AZ.  Originally from NY, I'm hard to please with this kind of stuff. The texture is like the bagels in L.I.  Crispy on the outside soft in the middle.  No one wants a dry bagel, at least I don't!  

-Cheers,"}
{"text":"East coasters, cease your search to fill the bagel shaped hole in your belly, because this is it. Fresh, crisp, delicious. Mmmmm. The owner is very helpful and just generally seems to be a great guy. However, the place seems disorganized. I waited for the longest time to place my order and they are often out of most of their food hours before it closes. 

Nevertheless, I would never recommend any other bagel spot to someone. Good. Food."}
{"text":"This place isn't anything fancy, it's small but their food is ABSOLUTELY amazing, and, I will not lie, it's warm inside which I don't mind because, well fresh bagels, enough said.
Favorite visit was a couple days, I had started work at 5a, so taking my lunch at 9a is annoying because not everywhere is serving lunch at that time of day. I walked in and nervously asked the lady, should've gotten her name, if they served lunch. She smiled at me and said, \"I can do anything.\" I got so happy and ordered \"The Sexy\" but with no herb mayo because I can't stand mayo, AT ALL. So she asked, \"Would you like to substitute the herb CREAM CHEESE instead?\" I got even more happy and asked, \"You can do that?\" She smiled and repeated herself, \"I can do anything.\" Needless to say, I was super happy about it and let me just say, that SANDWICH was f*cking phenomenal. I hate 5am shifts but I would do it again because now I know where to go for a 9a lunch, permanently."}
{"text":"We we're staying a night at the Arizona Grand Resort and we wanted to have breakfast on our way home.  This place was a little out of our way, but it was totally worth it.  Fresh bagels out of the oven and a line out the door.  We recommend getting a bagel flavor of your choice, lox, tomatoes, onions, and capers.  This is perfection.  Their everything bagel is awesome.  We would be here every weekend if we lived closer."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels that tasted very much like the NY bagels we enjoy back home !

The owner is very friendly and the service is efficient .

I would definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Omg! Being an old school Jewish gal, Arizona has garbage for bagels. I've lived here since 79, and. I had never found an authentic bagel. Until Now! Found on complete accident, through Google, craving a bagel. Wow! I sat in my Jeep, like a pig in heaven! Yum! Drool! I had two! I want more! This is my forever bagel joint! It's an old school joint! Love!"}
{"text":"Best bagels around.. no comparison. The owner runs a great business and the food is great! Love the breakfast bagels and my kids do too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in town. The owner is an incredible guy and so nice. He is so well respected in the community. Never disappointed when I get a bagel. Quick service for always having a large line. Love this place."}
{"text":"Best bagels and bagel sandwiches I've had since moving from NJ.  Rock on, Bagel Man!"}
{"text":"Best thing I've eaten in Phoenix!  The lox are extraordinary, fresh amazing bagels!!!!  Great service as well!  Wish I could give it more stars."}
{"text":"So delicious. The bakers come out from the back and interact with patrons. The owner was so friendly. It was easy to tell that everyone who is part of the business of proud to be there!"}
{"text":"Delicious freshly baked bagels! The most friendly staff around. Best bagels in the Ahwatukee area and very fair prices."}
{"text":"Bagels are delicious. The bread is thick and chewy, and I am definitely a fan. The owner is very friendly and staff is extremely helpful. Location is tucked away in a shopping center on the south side of Elliot Road just west of the I-10."}
{"text":"I live right down the street and my girls and I often ride our bikes down to the shop on Sunday mornings. The bagels are made fresh everyday, I often would see the windows all fogged with steam as I made my way to work at 5 Am in the winter. The kids love it. I usually get an everything bagel with the veggie cream cheese that they make. I actually have not branched out yet, but I will next time! It is really great when the bagels have just came out hot and you don't even need to toast them."}
{"text":"Quaint. Clean. And straight to the point. The staff, including owner are very friendly. Food, while limited in options, is perfect. Will return soon! I had the egg salad on the everything bagel, toasted. It was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"The owner is great. He made the experience really enjoyable. The bagels are sooo yummy. The macaroni salad I wouldn't recommend but the crumb cake is so amazing!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place.  Cal and my fave sandwich maker, Patrice, are simply great people.  These are authentic bagels, definitely the best by far in Ahwatukee, and I would wager to guess in the Valley.  No sense trying others, when this place is in my neighborhood.  Stop by and give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Forget Einstein's! These are real bagels that hold true to their promise that they're like the bagels back east. The owner is so welcoming, and will help you with the many many options! I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"These are my kinda bagels, man! A no funny bussiness kinda establishment. Just great food and sweet staff. My experience here brought me back to a trip to New York.

I grabbed a lox with chive cream cheese on a toasted everything bagel to go. The sandwhich was huge and smelled fantastic! They make their own spreads and the flavor proves it. The bagel itself was fluffy and had that nice subtle salty flavor a good bagel should have.

Service was quick and the staff were friendly. Will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Excellent bagels (especially the salt ones) and great service! Went for my first time the other day and can't wait to get back and get more bagels."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! I have been here a few times and each time I am equally impressed! Not only do the have the BEST lox bagel with capers, tomato, and onions, the service is so friendly! As a plus, they text your receipt to you, so I don't have to hold onto messy receipt with BPA chemicals!"}
{"text":"It's true. These are the best bagels I've come across in Arizona. The bagels had a delicate and flaky exterior with a soft interior. I came across this gem when my friend, originally from Brooklyn, was adamantly searching for a bagel reminiscent of the ones he found in his hometown.  Cal, the owner, was genuine and remembered my friend and me just after one stop to his shop. If looking for a place to buy quality bagels, there will not be many other stores rivaling The Bagel Man."}
{"text":"This is the best place in AZ to get an authentic NYC bagel!  If you're looking for the bagel lox they know how to do it right.  Just like in NYC where they smother it in cream cheese and don't skimp on the lox.  You'll enjoy every bite.  They run out quickly so you have to show up early to get the bagel you want.  No other bagel shop I've been to compares to the size and taste of these amazing bagels from The Bagel Man.  The staff is always friendly and more than willing to help you decide on what to order."}
{"text":"About as close to Jersey bagels as we've had since we've been here and taylor ham too!  Only downside was they were out of some of the varieties of bagels we wanted. Can you open a place in the West Valley?! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best New York style bagels....hands down! So soft and flavorful. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"The bagels here are extremely fresh and soft. The cream cheese is always flavorful and the texture is perfect. Beware- they will sell out. Many times, I have come here past 11 and most of the bagels have been sold. If you want the full selection, come early or on a week day! It's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Reminds me of walking right into a deli in Manhattan. The staff is always friendly and of course the bagels are amazing. Try the bacon egg and cheese on a toasted wheat bagel!"}
{"text":"These bagels are the best bagels in town. The owner and everyone who works there is incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"In general, I make it a habit to visit any restaurant that has a line out the door.  In fact, the longer the line the better.  Which is just what happened one sunny Saturday recently in Phoenix, when I was visiting a bucket list fabric store and (coincidentally) felt my empty tummy rumbling.  As I pulled out of the parking lot I noticed several out-of-place people standing outside a nondescript strip mall establishment. 

Who are these people?  I asked myself.  Why are they just standing...on the sidewalk...on a Saturday morning?  And then I spotted the sign above them: \"The Bagel Man\" it read in big red letters.  A quick peek at Yelp told me all I needed to know: it was here that I'd be stopping for breakfast.

So I parked the car and got in line.  I didn't even care what was on the other end of that line.  I just knew it would be good. 

I waited patiently, and eagerly, with the smell of fresh-baked goodness wafting past me.  I ogled the deli case, full of delicious-sounding house-mixed cream cheeses.  I thumbed my debit card as the line inched painfully forward.  Finally, it was almost my turn.  And just then, as if by magic, I heard two amazing words:

FRESH SESAME!

They were yelled from the bagel chef (er, baker?) as he tossed about a dozen puffy sesames into one of the many bagel baskets behind the front counter.  But the guy in front of me had heard the announcement too.  His forehead was practically sweating as he uttered the words \"I'll take a dozen sesame.\"  I wanted to beg him to take pity on me!  \"Give me my favorite bagel!  Please!  I love sesame bagels.  For goodness sake, I ONLY WANT ONE!\"

But I didn't.  As if by fate, though, his young daughter said \"Daddy, can I have a plain bagel?\"  So he swapped a sesame for a plain and you know how this story ends: the sesame bagel was mine.  ALL MINE!

I got it with a thick smear of lox cream cheese, quickly ran to my car, and devoured the whole thing in about 2 minutes.  Okay, 5 minutes.  And as I proceeded towards the airport and a flight home, I regretted I hadn't gotten one for the plane ride!"}
{"text":"Solid bagel spot. The bagels are really yummy and fresh. I got the sausage, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich. It was really good and super cheesy! The guy recommended not to toast the bagel since they were already freshly made and hot out of the oven! Really glad he did because it made the sandwich that much better. 
I didn't give the place five stars because it was so small and got really busy. There isn't really any place to wait for your to go order. It took awhile for my sandwiches and then when I said the order was mine the guys tried giving it to someone else. Maybe they can take down names when calling out the orders instead or give out numbers."}
{"text":"Always a great place to start your day! Bagels are fresh and made the New York way!! Once you try these bagels, you'll keep coming back!!

I always get the sausage, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a co-worker. It's close to my office, so I checked it out. I am a New Yorker, born and raised, and I love my bagels. This place is hands down THE BEST bagel west of the Mississippi. If you love authentic NY style bagels, search no further. Puts Chompie's to shame. Delicious bagels, friendly staff, great prices, and fast service. Please check this place out!!"}
{"text":"The Bagel Man has by far, THE best NY style bagels in AZ. I'm from Connecticut and lived in NYC so I know what a great bagel tastes like and he's done it here. Like another reviewer said, it's not quite H&H but the closest you'll get in the desert. 

Staff is friendly, the owner is there all time and super friendly as well. I love the everything bagel with cream cheese, simple but delish!  Only caution is that it's small inside and can get crowded in the mornings. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I, like many others, am from New York. So I have high expectations when it comes to bagels. I moved 6 years ago to CA and could not find a single bagel place that even touched what I was used to. So I'd have my mom just send me bagels! Although not as a fresh, it was a better alternative. So, when I moved to Tempe, I was VERY skeptical to find a place that I'd like.

I looked up bagel shops on Yelp and found The Bagel Man. Many other east coasters approved so I figured I'd give it a try. I went in on a Sunday morning around 7:30am and there were only a few people there. I think I was in and out in about 5 minutes! Their customer service was fantastic!

The bagels themselves were exactly what I was hoping for. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Tasted like NY heaven to me! 

The only downfall I had was that my bagel was a bit too over cooked and a little burnt-ish on the outside. But I bought a half dozen and no others were like that. I'd give them a 4.5 stars if I could. I certainly will be going back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place..I think it's the best bagel place in AZ. I lived in nyc for 13 years and loved bagels and those are the closest to nyc style I had in AZ...everything bagels with bacon and eggs is delicious"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Phoenix (hometown NYC) I gotta grab some bagels from this guy. His bagels taste like they came straight from New York's best bagel joint. They are fresh, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and huge. He is always there greeting customers (super friendly guy) and ensuring consistency and quality. If you like bagels, this is a must visit place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. AMAZING!! Maybe I am just a bit green and have never experienced a true bagel before (I am a native Phoenician) but Bagel Man seriously has the best bagels I have ever tasted in my entire life. 

I stop by here once a week or so before work and usually get an egg and cheese sandwich on an everything bagel, or a cheese bagel toasted with veggie cream cheese. The prices are very, very reasonable. I think they charge me less for coffee than Circle K, and the coffee is much better. I have never been by when the coffee is cold or stale.

The bagels are not the only reason this place earns 5 stars though.. The staff at this place are absolutely delightful. They are all so nice and friendly and work very hard to get you your order as quickly as possible. The owner is always so happy, and it is really neat to see how someones business can really succeed with love, dedication and hard work. 

The only thing I want to caution Yelpers about is if you plan on hitting this place before work, maybe call in your order. Sometimes it can get a bit chaotic here, and you wouldn't want to be late to work because you were waiting for your bagel!"}
{"text":"Best bagel I've had in a long time. Better than any I've found in California. May be the best bagel I've had more than 100 miles from the Atlantic Ocean. Thanks bagel man. Oh, and I hope your tukee stops hurting ;-)."}
{"text":"best bagels in the valley, best in phoenix, best in AZ, best in the west, best outside NY and NJ! in other words, i loved it! came in yesterday just passing by (i was the brunette east coast girl). loved the doughy-ness, nice plump bagels. there seem to be a few different kinds of \"real\" NY bagels and these are one of them.  if you don't see me in here every day, it's only because i will get ADDICTED! coffee was not perfect. maybe i didn't get a fresh batch."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the 1st time last week. WHERE have they been my whole life. Best bagels ever, great customer service. I drive out of the way just to get ny fix!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for people who do not live in the area... I'm a huge bagel fan but the bagel sandwiches take it to a whole new level! I got the everything bagel, jalapeño cream cheese, bacon, and egg sandwich and was absolutely thrilled! 

The family owned feel and service here is outstanding... everyone was so nice and helpful and  made the sandwich perfectly! We are excited to continue coming to the bagelman and inviting our friends to try this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Happy to have found a local, East-Coast feel for a bagel shop. Their sandwiches are great. I usually get egg, bacon, and cheese on a plain bagel...toasted. Mmmmmm.

The big guy who runs the place tends to stare down other big guys but maybe that's an East Coast thing too. 

Small area, but fast service."}
{"text":"Was told about this spot from a coworker and it did not disappoint.  Had the lox breakfast sandwich and also ordered a turkey sandwich for later - both were on a sesame bagel.   Great prices and very tasty. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Nicest staff that I've encountered in a very long time. Reasonable prices. Speedy service & the food is amazing!! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great bagels.  I had the roast beef on a salt bagel.  Great!  It was 1pm and I had the last salt bagel.  You might need to get their earlier if you are set on a specific type.  

He has a great reputation and the bagels are sold quickly by the dozen.

It is a small shop, bagels made onsite. I would call ahead if you need a large order."}
{"text":"The food deserves 5 stars, but the layout of the shop and lack of information for first-time visitors on how to order took 1 star away. The bagels are delicious and pretty large. I had lox and eggs on a plain bagel and my son had a chocolate chip bagel with plain cream cheese. I will definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Hi to my fellow foodies...

This just might be my shortest review yet!

Good bagel.. Good cream cheese... Awesome lox sandwich.... 

Loved that they opened at 5am so I could pick up bagels for work but I went there this morning after missing my bagel for a month or two and they were CLOSED!

It seems they DO NOT OPEN UNTIL 6am... 

Although I enjoy their bagels I don't enjoy them enough to go completely out of my way...

This was my breakfast go to place.... So sad they open later now....

So long Bagelman.....

Bon appetite'"}
{"text":"Honestly, you can taste that everything was fresh. It may take a little longer than chains - as everything is made fresh in the back by 1 person - but it's worth it! The everything bagel was fresh out of the oven, warm and was soft with a crunch exterior. SOOO GOOOD. And don't get me started on the veggie cream cheese. You could taste the veggies and could actually make out what was in it. 

The owner was running the register and was super sweet telling everyone happy Friday. 

I'm never going to another bagel place again."}
{"text":"I had a plain bagel w/ plain cream cheese and it was delicious! Staff was kind and helpful and the prices were very affordable!"}
{"text":"A coworker made a stop on his way to work and brought in a dozen for the office. I must say I haven't had this much amazing goodness of a bagel in a long time. Even a plain bagel is so light fluffy and the outside has crustiness that is perfect. They are also not your average size bagels, they are huge. The shmear omg I cannot even describe it, so good I can even just eat it all by itself. I haven't had this good of a bagel since I lived in NY. Gonna have to walk in and check this out myself. I heard there was a bit of a line in the morning, but all worth it."}
{"text":"I visited the Bagel man in the afternoon because I was craving a really good REAL bagel. Being from the East coast, ever since moving to AZ the bagels and bread and pizza crusts don't taste the same. I know it's got to do with the water somehow but let's just say THANK YOU BAGEL MAN! I do not live close by, but I will be coming back for sure. I tried their sesame bagel, pumpernickel, cinnamon raisin bagel,YES I took a few home and they were all delicious! Exactly the REAL bagel I've been looking for. Also, the veggie cream cheese was so good, I regret not buying more of it because it didn't last in my house. Highly recommend the bagel man for anyone who loves a good bagel. PS, the next day my bagels were still great and delicious. Many places the bagels are ok the first day and the next day hard as a rock, but not these. Perfect once lightly toasted :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! This is how a bagel should taste. The bagel man boils the bagels! We ate a sesame bagel with egg and cheese. Our son ate a croissant. Coffee was fine. Definitely will return again for one more breakfast sandwich while in AZ."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite! The staff is fast and awesome. The owner is great and super friendly. But the bagels. The bagels. They are to die for! Hands down the best I've EVER had! Great job Bagel Man, you've nailed it. 

I always get a cheese bagel toasted with jalapeño cream cheese smear, so delicious. Their sandwiches are are great for breakfast and lunch. 

If you are in the area do yourself a favor and get acquainted with the Bagel Man!"}
{"text":"It's been a little while since I've been here, but I seriously love the bagels they serve. I normally just get un-toasted bagels to go. Definitely try their Lox Spread! Got it on a toasted everything bagel last time - awesome! The coffee cake is also super moist and perfect. 

I see that some people have critiqued the service. I agree that it can be a little awkward, but I've always gotten what I wanted and been served well. One time a girl working there messed my order up, but the Bagel Man stepped in, fixed my order, and let me keep the stuff she messed up. The awkward part was that he yelled at her about it in front of me. Either way, the bagels are bomb!"}
{"text":"I'm from the motherland of Bagels...Brooklyn.  We take our bagels seriously.  I think all Einstein locations should be burned down.  

By far, Bagelman's are the best bagels I've had in AZ!  I used to live across the street and went often.  The owner is very nice.  My only word of caution is that they can take a really long time to fill your order.  One time I went looking for an onion bagel and was told that they would be 'right out'...20-25 minutes later I finally got my bagel.  After that I would just take whatever they had ready."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I am not sure if this place reads Yelp reviews or what... but anything negative that was said about this place is not the case today.  The place was spotless.  very very clean.  The people behind the counter were incredibly friendly and attentive of the customers that came through the door.  I was immediately greeted upon entering (even when he was helping another customer) and after ordering, my food was promptly made.  

The bagels were great.  Nice size.  Crispy on the outside, doughy in the middle.  Significantly larger than other bagel stores.  The lox were fresh.  The cream cheese you can tell is homemade. 

Overall, this will be the place I get bagels from now on.  This east coast Jew has found a winner.

Thank you bagel man."}
{"text":"Unassuming small mom and pop type place with nothing fancy about it. There are minimal amounts of seating inside and outside. You get your own coffee and sit down. Line was to the door but was fast. I had a bialy and butter. I asked for it well done. I wont ding them because apparently \"well done\" is a term that never made it to the future as time progressed from the late 80's into the 90s and onto today. However, they did manage to execute a really amazing bottom crust. The bread substance of the bialy was thicker than it should for a bialy and definitely had too much body (dense). The coffee was typical non-gourmet coffee...not the best. Due to the low cost and the most amazing crust I have had in a decade, I bumped a 3 to a 4."}
{"text":"Freshly made bagels every day with a New York flair definitely a great spot for breakfast or lunch! Personal favorite is the \"show off\""}
{"text":"These are the best bagels I've ever had, including bagels from NYC and Montreal! The shop is kind of hidden away, but it's worth the search. Very quick, very tasty."}
{"text":"Things that are awesome: 

staff!! First and foremost are so helpful and friendly

Bagels: are on point! They 100% have that New York bagel feel.

Cheese: that cheddah life!! The cheese was delicious 

Lacking: eggs....which is the star of a breakfast bagel show. I asked for runny fried eggs and got well cooked, dry ones.

It's a sad, sunny day in Arizona. I never get bagels while traveling because good ones are hard to come by.

I would try the lox from here next time but never an egg sammich again."}
{"text":"Best East Coast bagel in Arizona (and I'm from Jersey). Not sure if there's something in the water, but the bagels are PERFECT - light and fluffy on the inside but with the perfect crisp on the outside. Top favorites: lox bagel, chive cream cheese, everything bagel, but really everything is delicious.

To top it off, The Bagel Man himself is the sweetest guy. Make sure to grab a slice of coffee cake on your way out!"}
{"text":"The bagels are the best in the Southwest! What takes this over the top is the customer experience. Words cannot credit this establishment.  Try and you will be hooked! There may be a line, but that's what happens when it's  all good!"}
{"text":"Easy, fast, affordable breakfast.

I ordered an iced coffee for $1.99 and a breakfast bagel with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese. (The eggs are actually real everyone!)

They have a selection of fresh bagels to choose from.
I tried the cheesy one. It was soft with just the right amount of crispyness from roasting it."}
{"text":"The best bagel by far you'll find around here, nothing else even compares. They've fixed the issue of writing down large orders and it's really made a difference in the quality. Love the bagel man and will return"}
{"text":"The ONLY bagels I have found that are like those back East in NYC... And I've lived all over the country. Baked fresh daily and delicious.  PLUS... He has salt bagels!  If you love bagels and you're in the Ahwatukee/Chandler area. Then THIS is the place."}
{"text":"Best bagel I have had in a very long time. Yum!"}
{"text":"I stop here almost every morning.  The customer service is phenomenal and the bagels are always fresh. The cream cheese and bagel selection is consistent and fresh. I love and I'm obsessed with this place."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I had a bagel with cream cheese.  I should have gotten the cream cheese on the side because it was way too much for me.  The bagel I had seemed a little overcooked.  Too brown.  Overall, I was not very impressed.  Maybe I hit them on an off day."}
{"text":"The most amazing bagels I've had since New York. The staff and owner are very friendly, and always spend time to visit with the customers while they're waiting for their orders. The line moves very fast, and totally worth the brief wait."}
{"text":"Definitely delicious. I hear it's an authentic New York bagel, but it doesn't seem that different from most other bagels, aside from Einsteins but that's the wonder bread of bagels. I love their everything bagel with lox cream cheese. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Already a line at 6:20 in the morning but definitely worth the wait! The bagels have a soft, fluffy texture (even a day after). Schmear was the perfect topping for the warm, fresh breakfast snack. I got a baker's dozen for my co-workers and they loved every bite! The Bagel Man was a hit. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The best bagels hands down. At my work we get bagels once a month and for some odd reason they found this place and we had so many people agree that when compared to any other bagel shop this one beats them. Who ever did the bagel run had to drive an additional 15 miles just because the bagels were better then the closer bagels store."}
{"text":"I've been search for five years now. The Bagel Man is the real deal. Finally, my fellow New Jersey-ite has brought the bagel to Phoenix. Gett'um hot on Sunday morning."}
{"text":"These are probably the best bagels I have ever had. 10/10 would recommend! There are tons of amazing bagel and cream cheese options, along with breakfast sandwiches. These bagels are so fresh that the owners told me not to order them toasted. I listened to him and I will definitely go back! Great service, very quick and nicest employees. Wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Update on my review, still 5 stars! Love this place and come several times a week.  I have no idea why you would go to any other bagel place in a 5 mile radius, well except on Mondays when they are closed.

My suggestion is a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese on a Cinnamon Raisin, it will change your life.  The Boy loves their Scrambled Eggs with Lox sandwich which is an amazing deal.  His sandwich is always loaded up and feels like it weights pounds.  The Boy and I always say we wish we would try their lunch sandwiches but I love their bagels by themselves so I stick with that.

They have had a minor change in prices so the older photos of the menu are out of date but don't let that stop you from visiting.  All the Points to Bagel Man!"}
{"text":"Easily the best bagels in Phoenix.  Lofty statement I know, but try for yourself and you'll say the same thing.  Well done Bagel Man"}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars! We showed up for a couple bagels to find out that they were sold out but had a fresh batch baking that would be done in 15 minutes. We ran to the store and returned to fresh baked bagels unlike any other bagel we've ever had..literally melt in your mouth. 

I will never be able to have a store bought bagel again thanks to the bagel man. 

On another note the fresh made cream cheese is the perfect accompaniment. Do yourself a favor and get the everything bagel with scallion cream cheese, you're welcome. 

Owner (I think) helped us and was great. 
Already thinking about my next bagel experience at the bagel man."}
{"text":"There is nothing that compares anywhere else in AZ! One bite and you are instantly in NYC. Also the only place you can get an egg bagel!! BEC on an egg bagel is pure heaven! Worth the drive from anywhere!!! (Caution: closed on Mondays!)"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I have to admit a boiled bagel is so much better than a baked bagel. The owner convinced me to skip toasting the bagel. I was surprised at the outer crunch and inner chewiness. Delicious! My only complaint is sometimes they skimp on the cream cheese, which made me disappointed, because it is so amazing. Hands down, best bagel I've ever had! I'm so glad this little gem is close to my home!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I get the everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese. And it's always amazing! I go early in the morning so it's always a fast and easy trip for me. Everyone is always really nice and easy to please."}
{"text":"Make sure you get here early! They sell out of bagels throughout the morning, and the best ones always go first. They make their own cream cheese in house and they are all amazing. Their breakfast bagel sandwiches are also very good, and a great price for the quality that you are getting. Their staff is super personable, and helped recommend items on the menu for us to get and cream cheese/bagel pairings. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I sent my son there to get me a cream cheese everything bagel and a plain blueberry bagel. both were very yummy. love bagels. so many are not authentic. this place is..."}
{"text":"Adventures in Bagels. As often as they may be good, they are not good. Inconsistency is not a good thing in business, especially for a restaurant. In any event, I do not believe they are first boiled like a real N.Y. bagel should be. If they are, something else is wrong.
At the busiest times they may be out of the most popular styles. Not good when you are anticipating your meal.
On one occasion, Owner was out of change and actually told me he would \"Catch me Next Time:. Really?  If anything, he should have offered to undercharge me by the difference, and not the opposite.
Also, if you need a receipt be ready to give out your email address, cause that is the ONLY way to get one. Not even sure this is Legal!
Should be given the option of a hard copy at time of service, OR, emailed at your choice.
Bagels may be good at times, but, too many other important things are off putting."}
{"text":"For all of you New York and jersey folks looking for a taste of home, this is the place. Bagels are excellent. Ordered a sausage and cheese on everything. Was pretty solid... Then I talked to the owner who is from New Jersey and incredibly friendly, mentioned I was from jersey and he dropped the hammer \"we have Taylor ham\". He offered to replace my sandwich... But I said nope, let's double down and get another one. 

For you jersey expats who think you can only get a TEC on an everything within the confines of the garden state, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Might need a 12 step program for this place!  Came for  lunch yesterday and brought the family back for breakfast,  everything was so good, took a few more and some cream cheese to go! Can't wait to come back for the Rueben!
 Exit 143B on the Parkway (it's a Jersey thing!)"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome! Great bagels and really awesome customer service. Super friendly staff. The one complaint I have is that the place is an oven. Good god, I am surprised they haven't gotten heat stroke! Thankfully I get my order to go, mostly! Otherwise, you can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"These are legit, old-school quality New York style bagels. The bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwich and The Sexy are my favorites. The bagels are all awesome and fresh and is just a matter of preference what you choose. Great,  prompt service,  delicious menu, friendly staff, good prices, what more can you want? This is my go-to bagel place, every time. I am never disappointed. Solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best bagel place! It can get packed so expect a line and try to get there early in the day so you're not stuck with the leftover bagels that, although delicious, might not be exactly what you planned on ordering."}
{"text":"I Iove going to the bagel man!!! The bagels are always on point! I go at least once or twice a week for breakfast. However, lately the customer service has been crappy. Ever since the African American man (the bagel man) left, this new man offers the worst customer service. When I asked when the bagel man was coming back, he replied \"IM THE BAGEL MAN THIS IS MY SHOP IM THE BAGEL MAN!!\" I love the food but the lack of customer service is something I can't overlook. Sorry bagel man! Call me when the real bagel man returns!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here for a bagel, you're missing out. It a small shop with a big New York feel. Bagels and everything on their menu is top notch."}
{"text":"Makes a Jersey Girl so happy and proud to eat somewhere that understands how bagels should be made. The Bagel Man gets 5 stars without any hesitation. Great food for a great price. Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"The bagels were delicious. It was warm and toasty in there as well. Plus, the eggs were real - which was awesome.

However, they use American cheese on the egg and cheese sandwiches and it really ruined it for me.

Would go back again, and ask for no cheese!"}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of Bagel until I met the Bagel Man. Yum, Yum, Yum! These are extremely dangerous due to their addicting nature. I've limited my visits to once a week and spend the other six thinking about my next visit. See you in a few days!"}
{"text":"Great east coast bagels. A no frills store that does it right.  Thanks for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Went to The Bagel Man for the fist time, very disappointed.  The bagel is just a glorified bread roll, not boiled and baked as advertised.  We ordered 2 bagel and lox sandwiches,  but they had no flavor, no capers, no onion and no lemon. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I tried this place out yesterday for the first time. Let me start by saying that my review is probably worth nothing, because there are some 160 reviews and the average rating for this place is four and a half stars. That speaks volumes to me. So here is what I have to say: I have never had a bagel or even known that a bagel could be as perfect in every way imaginable until yesterday. I kid you not, everything from the texture to the taste is astonishing. I stayed in Time Square for quite a while and have had my fair share of bagels from places all over the country and NONE of them compare to here."}
{"text":"SOOO good! Go here all the time, get the salt bagel with lox spread everytime! Super friendly owner as well :)"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are always to die for. There will always be a steady flow of people because everyone loves this place, but you get your meal in a timely manner so don't let the lime length detour you. Amazing staff. Plus I love their coffee."}
{"text":"Fresh made bagels restocked every few minutes. Owner is the cashier and obviously the Bagel Man. I've recently become a fan of Lox and theirs is awesome, also can't go wrong with any of the Breakfast sandwiches, I love that they have peanut butter and jelly. Service is awesome and super speedy."}
{"text":"Great bagel shop. Love the sandwiches and breakfast. Everything is made to order and delicious. Can get crowded but that's because it's successful."}
{"text":"Went all out with sliced lox, tomato, onion, and capers. Reminded me of Sabels in NYC. Great service too!"}
{"text":"This place has the best bagels in AZ hands down. Real handmade bagels from back east not rolls passed off as bagels line other chains. Owner is a great guy and learned his trade from some of the best in the business. Great place for bagels and sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is the most basic of the basic bagel shops.  While at a work function, a coworker & I got up crazy early one morning to go on a long walk before our breakfast meeting.  That long walk turned into an insanely long walk and I feel like we walked to the next state - long story short we were hungry and wandered into some sort of industrial park with not a coffee shop to be found.  We kept walking and found a small strip mall with the only open business at the time... The Bagel Man.  We popped in for two coffees and bagels.  The Bagels were good, but I'm from the American North East - we have high standards for our bagels...so there is good and then there is GOOD.  This was good.  The coffee was basic, the service was friendly and really quick.  It is a tiny little place with very limited seating so if you don't get in early, you are likely to have a tough time finding some place to sit.  Out door seating is available - but do you really want to do that in the Arizona sun?"}
{"text":"The bagel was really good.I order a everything bagel with jalepeno cream cheese.  I went around 1pm and the bagel still tasted fresh. I asked for it lightly toasted, she toasted it perfectly. My only issue was too much cream cheese but thats no big deal would 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"The best bagels we ever had.  Also, the only went gave us a crumb cake that was so delicious!  Must try if you are in town."}
{"text":"Great bagels, and being from NYC's Upper West Side I should know."}
{"text":"The place smelled great and the sandwiches we bought and ate there were very good (I love the rye)!  The bagels, however, tasted too bready for me.

I spent the last 45 years in the Atlanta area, where there are several excellent bagel delis.  The bagels here made me wish for Atlanta, not Phoenix."}
