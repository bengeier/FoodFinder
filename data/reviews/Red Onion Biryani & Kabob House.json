{"text":"The lunch specials are under $7 and you get huge portions that include naan and rice. I found the flavors of the dishes to be very authentic. The Biryani was full of aromatics and spices. The chicken boti was very well cooked and moist. The side salad was very basic with little to be desired

I would recommend ordering take out. The ambiance is not warm and welcoming. The food presentation could be improved."}
{"text":"Amazingly big portions. Very reasonable $ wise. Good ambiance considering the locale.  Loved their fish curry with Roghni naan. Flavorful Tandoori chicken. Rice was on the spicy side but maybe it's just me. I'm a foodie and I thoroughly enjoyed the food, which was made fresh at the time. Did I mention I was there around 9:45ish? (P.M) - on a week night.

TWO THUMBS UP guys!!

Went here again today for lunch pick up and for $11 - he gave me 2 Roghni naans and fish curry in a very re-usable container along with Salad and Samosa AND rice! Big portion size and definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"I am going to give this place the 5 star hidden gem it desrves :)

In my quest to find the best Indian food in Durham, I stumbled in here.  I ate the Chicken Tikka Masala, and no joke used these guys for my wedding!

As you can see from my Yelp postings, I have seen many Indian / Pakistani Restuarants in the city.  This is your Durham spot!

The chef behind the counter is a well spoken polite chef.  My pleasure eating here!

Try their chicken tikka masala to start.  See if you agree."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times. Also had take-out, which was a bad experience because I found out the order was not complete when I got home.

The food is quite good, and I find that the place is generally kind of quiet. It's better for the ambiance when some Desi movies are on the TV.

Back to the food - it tastes great and is pretty good value. Don't order too much naan - they are huge.

The downside is that they do not serve alcohol, which is a miss for me when having a dinner on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Tried the weekend halwa puri special and loved it. The Chana masala and aloo methi were awesome with the huge puris but the halwa wasn't very impressive. Will definitely go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have no idea if the 1 review bad 1 star review person is a competitor - we went here and it was phenomenal.  We had the Chicken Kahari with Chicken Biryani, Naan, Paratha, and a sample appetizer dish with Samosa's; Fish; Chicken; and Pakora that was to die for.  Honestly this was better than my friend's mothers (who is Pakistani).

I didn't find it expensive - I found it reasonable.  The place is very clean - immaculate. Mostly take out (we ate in we were the only one's eating in) - but we sat there and the place was hopping with people coming and going for take out. 1 star only taken away for Naan and Paratha (it was good but not great).  The food on the other hand was absolutely good.

There was a British lady picking up her curry order - so for you Brits who know crave a good curry this is absolutely the place.

The serving size was huge we were stuffed and couldn't actually finish our Biryani so I have no idea why the 1 star person who has only given 1 review said the portions were small - this is absolutely not our experience.

This place is family run - and they care about their food - its the next best thing to going for a real home cooked Pakistani/Indian dinner. Honestly I liked the food.  I like Food Time on Kingston Road - and - this place (both are excellent).

Try this place - not sure what that bad 1 person review is about - as it is polar opposite of our experience 

Oh we had their Chai also - excellent chai"}
{"text":"Really great food! The prices are good as well - not too expensive! The service is fast and they let you call in to order takeout. They always put a good amount of chicken in the butter chicken and they give you plenty of rice. The other dishes are good as well. A really great place to try if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"I love the food.  but dining here is awkward.  I have never seen people eat here.  They don't know what they are.  they setup like fine dining but they can't pull it off.  I think they should just be focused on takeout and mall style dining.  I mean who lays out so much white table cloth for curry dishes.  Food is great!"}
{"text":"The chicken kabob was chewy and unbearable to eat. The samosas were very greasy and spicy. Not worth going. Very unhappy. 

FYI their changing the name to Red Onion."}
