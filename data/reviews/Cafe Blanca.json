{"text":"Went here for a paint nite. Macarons were delightful! I ordered a dozen of them to take home. The employees were great. Super friendly and a welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Great spot very close to the princess island. Try their Siphon coffee, it's very good. Very relaxed atmosphere with friendly staff."}
{"text":"An awesome addition to the Calgary cafe culture. A spacious yet intimate cafe in the base of the Riverfront towers across from Eau Clair Market. This place has coffee beans that are single origin independently sourced, and honestly are quite unique in flavor. The food selection is small and high quality, as well as always changing. 

The atmosphere is very cheerful and relaxing. With comfy pillows to relax in, many windows and lots of power outlets, its a great place for a meeting, studying or relaxing with friends.  They even have a separate room with a TV and various board games to chill out in for a while. 

Check it out and support a great local business."}
{"text":"I spend far too much time at Cafe Blanca.

The cushy window seat is my favourite spot in Calgary to curl up with my laptop and whittle away on articles. It's also a great place to spend a rainy afternoon chatting with a friend, or reading a book, for as a meeting up or winding down spot for a night out, and.... 


And then, of course, there's the star of Blanca - its coffee. 

I usually hate coffee and will only drink the super-sweet options like mochas and frappes. But Blanca has changed all that, teaching me that coffee is something delicious if it's actually made right. 

They also get major pluses for good food, great artwork, lots of space, hosting community events, and above all, the staff, who are knowledgeable, friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"I'm quite fond of this cafe! I love that they stay open later on weekdays, especially since it's downtown. (Everything downtown, outside of bars, seems to close at 6pm!) :p I also love that they host events and live performances in the space. Oh and the coffee isn't bad either. ;)

I was fortunate enough to catch a live music set for my 1st time there. Sipping on an iced mocha, listening to awesome tunes, while staying dry from the rain is a pretty sweet experience!

I have yet to try their food items, so no review yet on how the eats are. But man, their goodies case looks tempting!

This is also one of the places in the city that makes real deal siphon coffee! (Possibly the only place to do siphon coffee in Calgary? Unsure about that.) It's super cool to watch and is my favourite brewing method!

Disclaimer: I have not had their siphon coffee yet! [UPDATE AT BOTTOM]
A shocker since I'm going to rave about the method in the next paragraph! ;p

So why my love for siphon coffee? When coffee places give tasting notes for their brews, I very, very rarely taste any of the flavours they say are there! That's not because they aren't there, it's because of my underdeveloped and very limited coffee experience/palate/skills. But with siphon coffee a lot of the very bitter and very sour tastes tend to get left out of the final product. I can have a dark roast straight up, no cream or sugar, and I can taste and enjoy the coffee. It's also super cool to watch!

As for what I did have: I like their mocha, it's a nice size, tastes good, but I liked it even more iced. I could taste more chocolatey goodness that way.

The place has a really great relaxed vibe, checkout their Facebook page or their main website for upcoming events. This is the real magic of Cafe Blanca for me. It's a fantastic intimate space for live shows, but there's also little corners to have a coffee and chill alone. Plus, a whole semi-separate room to hideout in and play board games with your friends! 

Oh yeah, that's right! They have board games as well!! If you're in the area and can drop by, I recommend checking it out!

UPDATE:
I have tried their siphon coffee and unsurprisingly I loved it! It's a bit of a splurge but I do recommend spending the extra for any darker/bolder flavoured varieties. You get a fair amount of coffee, it's the coolest thing to see and it tastes great!
I don't like lighter roast coffees made this way. They often taste too watered down for me but any dark roast, bold blends or richly flavoured varieties are awesome when siphon brewed!

So yes, this is a fantastic coffee shop for the atmosphere, board games, live shows, and their coffee!

Oh and you can reach a Pok√©stop from some of their seats! ;)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you're looking to plug in and work. They have music in the background, but it's not so loud that it's distracting. There are also a lot of outlets, which is super important. The best is the room in the back, where you can definitely share the power ports with others around you.

I came in on a Sunday around 11am, and there was only 1 other guy working there. I'm not sure how crowded it might normally be, but this was definitely the ideal spot if you're wanting to work or read a book. 

The display case had both gluten and gluten-free items sharing the space. It looked like all the gluten items were wrapped up, and the gluten-free items were exposed. Not sure if this is ok with people having celiac, but just fyi.

I've forgotten the gentleman behind the counter, but I'm guessing from the vibe that everyone who works here is super chill and nice. I asked about an einspanner (or espresso con panna) and he didn't know what it was, but was totally down for making me one once I explained it.  He also didn't judge me for requesting a decaf espresso, which makes me *heart* this place more.

You can tell they really care about their coffee, because he later came to the back of the room where I sat to ask if it tasted ok. He also noticed the library book I was reading and chatted me up about it. I know some people preferred to be left alone (including myself), but I enjoyed his friendly chatter. This is a nice non-pretentious neighborhood coffee shop."}
{"text":"I have eyed this cafe for so long and when I finally went with a friend, I was disappointed. The mocha I ordered took at least 10-15 minutes. It wasn't amazing or anything and I found it was overpriced as well. Interesting art on the wall however. Wrapping their goods in plastic wrap is quite possibly the most unglamorous and unappetizing thing I've seen in a really fancy cafe. Would like to try the siphon coffee next time and see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"I love dropping by Cafe Blanca and grabbing a tea latte and a macaron to enjoy while getting some homework done. The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly. I don't usually order it, but the siphon coffee is a must for coffee lovers, it's the least acidic and smoothest cup of black coffee I've ever had."}
{"text":"Remember what Eau Claire used to be like? It was a bustling community space with artists, musicians and a diverse community of people enjoying their day. Cafe Blanca reignites this community focus in the Eau Claire Area - this time, with a focus on Coffee.

They love coffee. They love coffee more than you love coffee. You might have thought you loved coffee, but they take it to a level that honestly, you probably won't every care to know. This is good, because the result of which for your average coffee loving Joe, is a very delicious cup of joe.

There's a few kind of seating arrangements, whether you're looking for a quick bite or looking to get social with some friends, a date, and interview, or cozy up and get social online with your email in a corner somewhere. It's a good space if you need some focus time because it's somewhat quiet right now, but it's really quite great so if this review has anything to do with it, I hope to see a little more bustle in the near future. :)

If you're looking at staying even a little longer there's a detached back room complete with TV if you wanted to host a large meeting, or some boardgames if you feel like hanging out next to the sunny windows.

The food is fresh tasting and quite healthy. As coffee shops become a big part of my work day, it's nice to be able to find a meal that is both tastes good and is healthy at the same time.

A very welcome addition to the Eau Claire Area. Make sure you make this your summer bike path ride coffee stop!"}
{"text":"Great little setting. Have been here with lots of people and all on my lonesome. It's a great little place to catch up with friends or just work the day away. I love the bench seating and the space is quite spacious. One of my favorite cafes in the city. I'm not a coffee drinker but have heard awesome things about it. The tea selection is great! Love that I don't have to fight for a place to sit since it's not on a main road like Higher Ground on Kensington Road or Analog on 17th."}
{"text":"I didn't really know this was here until they were home of a coffee house play that had actors around the room, the audience and the public just popping in and out for a cup of coffee. While here I also noticed they do paintnites and it would be a great lit venue for those!   

Anyway,  this coffee house is right next to Eau Claire in the bottom of what I'd say is going to be a condo building. I haven't figured out what some of their contraptions do to make drinks - I get some flash backs of chemistry class when I look at the flasks and little burners they have to one side.  I will have to explore the science of coffee but this trip I had an ice tea and a slice of red velvet cake.   The ice tea was great and the red velvet cake was just a sliver which really is a great size to satisfy without too much guilt. 

Over all it's a cute place and now I want to find a paintnite there because it's a great painting space unlike many of the bar spaces I've painted in..."}
{"text":"Upside down coffee!
Ok so I'll have you know I'm not a coffee person at all, but I had wondered in this place for a tea while I was on one of my pokemon go obsession walkabouts...ekk.  The London fog tea I got was supper rich and creamy. While waiting for my tea I was asking silly questions about scientific looking coffee makers.  Poor girl at the counter she was so pleasant and put up with me and all my silly questions about the contraption. The staff are so Lovely and knowledgeable. 
Coming to the conclusion that I should bring my coffee snob friend for upside down coffee! Really I just wanted to try some of his if I didn't like. Well weeks later I finally managed to get him out of the house and he was impressed with the shop even mentioned that it almost has that vibe and look from the friends T.V. show. Finally we get the sacred upside down coffee.  I will tell you that I have now become a coffee person. All the bitterness or that burnt after taste that you would get from a typical roosted coffee gone. 
 I have been converted!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe, which Is seemingly pretty new and undiscovered. Great place to hangout and just collect your thoughts. Coffees pretty good and fairly well priced. I'm only here because I had a job interview that took place here but turned out to be a great Cafe! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed to say the least. I came in because I was inspired by their posts of cakes from Cakes By Lai (which BTW are excellent, and you should totally order your next cake from her for your next special event) and Corbeaux bakery. The menu is sorely lacking of any options. I wanted a BLT, but had to wait a while for a new one, so I got a ham croissant instead. It was so underwhelming and something I could've whipped up on my own at home! 2 slices of ham, a slice of cheese, and maybe some mayo on a croissant?!? I also got a chocolate banana muffin - bleh. And to finish off I got a latte and didn't care for it at all. I don't know what it is with these cafes and their love for berry-like tasting roasts. Keep on simple and strong and I would be a happy camper. I wouldn't come back again. The interior design and decor are absolutely fabulous. The ambiance is very nice, however the food and drink is just nothing out of the ordinary for me."}
{"text":"WOW cool. I live in the condo above this Cafe and I have to say, I love coming here. They have events couple times a month. Its also a great place for young people to get together. Drinks are standard but this place is not about the drinks, its about the hangout. Also they open late. 

They also serve croissants, sandwich, snacks etc. Not just drinks.

Awesome place."}
{"text":"Love this spot. 

Been here a few times already and we are always greeted by the friendliest baristas. Best of all, they have a piano and some guitars too which is very conducive to live jam sessions with friends. 

The last time we came in, there was an art show setting up, which we thought was super neat. Also found out that they have a packed events calendar and are very open to hosting events, which is the best part about Cafe Blanca. It's quite rare to find a business with such a community minded focus and can actually back up its words with actions. 

This is a great hangout spot to catch up with friends too. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"If I were on a sitcom, Cafe Blanca would be my Central Perk.

I was at Cafe Blanca for a workshop on Saturday morning. And I gotta say I am absolutely in love with this place. 

It's located right across from Eau Claire Market, so the location is awesome! Cafe Blanca's atmosphere is a more chill than other trendy coffee shops. The crowd (when I was there) were young couples, young parents, older couples and the \"run in and out, got places to go\" crowd. 

The vibes are calm too. You're surrounded by inspiring quotes where your eyes are naturally drawn to. There is a piano (I hope a pianist stops by once in awhile or better yet, I wonder if anyone could just jam out on it?) There is a section with floor pillows! Like c'mon! This is a dream coffee shop. Wait, it gets better!! 

There is a boardgame room! Cafe Blanca is the perfect spot for every kind of crowd. You must check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee. I tried the siphoned coffee for the first time.  It was quite pricey at about $9 per cup but it was a really good cup of coffee.  I can't for sure say it was worth my extra $4-5 good but it was a really good cup.  I'd be interested in trying it again with a different roast.

The service in here is top notch and they explain the whole process to you.  The food was quite good as well."}
{"text":"Caf√© Blanca combines coffee with culture and community to make everyone who visits feel comfortable. The coffee is excellent. I consider the staff here to be artists. They do the research, hard work and not only is this a delight for our senses ... Smell... Sounds.. Touch... Taste... Sight... Because everything here is beautiful... but I'm happy that this place is truly for everyone. There's a kind and positive vibe here.

They use siphoning technology that I've only seen in New York City. The equipment comes from Japan and it's the only coffee shop in Calgary that offers this type of coffee brewing. The result is a smooth taste that deepens and changes as you drink your cup of coffee. 

I always thought of coffee as bitter. Mud water. A dark abyss of misery. 

Caf√© Blanca teaches us coffee is a special drink that comes from sustainable farms, and should be cherished and sipped like a fine wine.

Or you can drink a glass of wine. Or a beer. Or a matcha latte. Or A fresh salad. Or the best macaron you've ever eaten.

The place transforms depending on the event. The coffee sold also depends on what is current, the best tasting, they work with independent coffee buyers and tasters. There's a piano, and a collection of guitars. In another room there are games and small tables. 

This is a great place for everyone; couples, families, small groups, business people, friends and coffee lovers."}
{"text":"I really enjoy hanging out at Cafe Blanca! I've been here a few times and I like that their drink menu is full of different options. Their food menu is like many other caf√©s, sandwiches and salads, but it's cool that some nights they change up what they have to offer for eats. 

I think the ambience of caf√©s are extremely important, and Cafe Blanca is cool, welcoming, and they promote the arts which is not always the easiest to find in Calgary. If you're in the area stop by for an open mic night, grab a drink, and let the vibes take you away."}
{"text":"Stopped into his new downtown cafe after the gym in the hopes of a quick, healthy dinner.
When I asked about the gluten free sandwiches they said they were going to be getting some soon, so I settled for a small boccicini salad, added shrimp (3 pieces) and a small almond milk latte.
This ran me $18.

Yikes.

The salad was decent, quite oily and the cold shrimp salad skewer was soggy which made me sad. My latte was decent, not the best. 

The cafe itself seems like a cool place to hang out, neat tables, nice ambiance. The food/coffee just didn't do it for me.

I will totally give it a second try though because a new cafe downtown is always worth it to me."}
