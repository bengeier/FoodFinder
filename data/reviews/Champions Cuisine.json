{"text":"New dumpling place on 2nd level of markham T&T next to Morals Village.

Great find for us.  Place is pretty new and quiet.  Xiaolong bao - super thin skin, super juicy but be careful since we burnt our tongues - totally our fault for not waiting.
We also ordered 2 noodles.  Beef noodle soup was a large portion.  Same with pickled veg with pork noodle soup.  Beef pancake was yummy as well.

Only wish menu had more variety for our liking.  Would still go back since food was tasty and service was very good.  Nice decor and clean washrooms.  Welcomed addition to the dumpling and noodle places in the Kennedy/Highway 7 area."}
{"text":"This place is still rehearsing; their grand opening will be in March. Simple decor with Chinese opera masks painted on umbrellas hanging on one side of the wall and a huge picture of an actress in Chinese opera costumes on the other. I like their simple lunch set menu.  All same price; each comes with an appetizer, side and an entree.  The appetizer is roasted peanuts, beans and pickled vegetable.  We had two lunch set.  The steamed soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) which comes with sweet potato cake.  Fried dumplings with congee (Fried -add $1)  Both the steamed soup dumplings and fried dumplings have a burst of steam on the first bite. The meat is juicy and the wrappers are made perfectly with the right thickness.  Sweet potato cake is chewy and delicious.  Attentive and friendly service.  ^^close Monday^^"}
{"text":"Bit of a hidden gem.  I'm a bit surprised how quiet it is sometimes. 

Their xiaolong bao/baozi are juicy and have a very thin wrapper.

Lunch special is $7.99. Their menu is pretty small but I've enjoyed everything I've had there so far."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my wife. We sat at one of the booths but there was a big distance between the bench and the table. As others have mentioned it is not a big menu but the waitress was very helpful in giving us suggestions. We had some dumplings, beef noodle soup and chive tart that we shared. Everything was good. The dumplings even had juice squirting out when I bit into them. The price for everything was reasonable."}
{"text":"im a big fan of dumplings so i wanted to check it out when i saw that it was a fairly new business. came with a friend, we both ordered noodles and shared 12 steamed pork and chive dumplings.

i ordered the beef noodle. it was probably some sort of stewed beef as it was soft and fatty as oppose to the more rubbery brisket i'm used to. it's pretty much one of the things i order almost everywhere i go, so i have a fairly large sample size to compare to. based on that sample size, i can't say that this was a great entree because i've had better at many other places. again, the beef was more fatty than it was meaty, not a big fan of the (egg?) noodle that they used, and i was left with a starchy/pasty after texture in my mouth. that being said, i'm being really hard just because i have to compare it to some excellent beef noodle soups from other places, and this just wasn't up to those standards.

the dumplings were not bad though, they served the steamed dumplings on a plate, which was a first for me. I'm used to having them served in the steamer itself, maybe just the \"xiao long bao\" are served that way. it was pretty good, i prefer my dumplings fried though so I'll give this place another shot before i make a final verdict."}

Another new addition to the group of restaurants behind the plaza strip of T & T Unionville.

Champions Cuisine has this funky modern deco that I really like and the interior is spacious. Sadly the menu choice is limited and boring. I am giving them the benefit of doubt as they still in their soft opening stage and menu offerings could be adjusted easily.

Lunch Special $7.99 is similar to the pricing of the regular menu but with additional small appetizer on tge side.

Braised Beef Noodle ????? has a nice aromatic broth and the beef was tender. Sadly the noodle was so overcooked with no bite at all.

Dumplings at $7.99 definitely on the pricey side which I cannot comment as I have not try that yet.

But I hopefully Champions Cuisine will become a real winner in the future.

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Champions Cuisine is a newly opened shop near T&T with an odd combination of Chinese comfort foods. They have congee, soup dumplings, regular dumplings, noodle soup, and an array of salty/spicy side dishes that pair nicely with the plain congee they serve. 

What I really love about this place is variety for a good price. You get practically a chinese \"3 course meal\" (aka peanuts, congee, tea, and entree) for under $10. Portion sizes are reasonable enough for these combination meals to be split between two as well (if you're one of THOSE people of course).

The decor is nice, the place is spacious, but the individual meals themselves? Not comparable to a local chinese store that specializes in them. Don't come here if you just want to fulfil that xiaolongbao or beef noodle craving. Don't come here especially if you want some good congee. Come here if you are in a rush, low in cash, and down to try random dishes together."}
