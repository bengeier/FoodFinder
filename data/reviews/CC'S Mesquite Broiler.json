{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time - before it became CC's it was Chuy's, one of my favorite places for a casual meal. When Chuy's closed I was pretty bummed out.  I am so glad that Angela and Joyce took over and kept the place going - with pretty much the same recipes!  The food is as good as ever!  Great food, fair prices and a self serve chips and salsa bar.  How can you go wrong?  Highly recommend the 1/2 or 1/4 chicken, although the salad is really goo too."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!  The food is excellent and costs less than eating fast food, plus it's healthier.  The 2 ladies running CC's Mesquite Brolier have done a great job with the staff, remodeling upgrades, menus, and service!!!  Great drink prices, friendly staff, & great atmosphere for adults and kids.  It's refreshing to see these 2 local women running this place and working as hard as they do.  I've seen how they make everyone feel at home and treat everyone like famliy.  I love it here.  Give CC's a try.  Great for breakfast, lunch & dinner."}
{"text":"If you like Chuey's, you'll like CC's.  Former people who ran a chueys bought this property and it's pretty much the same, only better...good beer & food.  I like the fish tacos.  same free chips & salsa.  kind of noisy."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the food. Mesquite broiled tri tip sandwich is okay at best. Won't go back for food, but maybe drinks and live music."}
{"text":"Resurrected from the closed Chuy's.  Almost exactly the same.  Walk in, order at the bar.  Self serve chips bar with salsa and shake.  Local crowd at the bar.  Everything that Chuy's was.  Even down to the roll of paper towels on every table.  The only difference I noticed was that instead of a stuffed animal to give you for your order (as a marker for the server), now it's a numbered small orange cone. 

Love the mesquite salmon dinner with mex rice and beans.  Good place to catch a game on one of the many TV's.  Sort of a Mexican/Mesquite/Sports/Local hang out.

Recently had the large nachos.  Awesome!  Huge.  I could not eat a thing after finishing it!"}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone downhill! It was so wonderful after the whole Chuy's debacle that this stayed open and originally it was even better than when it was Chuy's. It was cleaner, they got rid of those gross stuffed animals and the food portions and quality were great. We went in several months ago and that's no longer the case. I couldn't believe how filthy the restaurant was. The fish tacos on Friday's went from $0.99 each to $1.99 with way less fish. It seems like they are now skimping on the food perhaps in an effort to make more money. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos and inside were three tiny shrimp that had been cut in half. When I say tiny I don't even mean cocktail size shrimp I mean shrimp smaller than my pinky. Shrimp is not that expensive so there is no excuse for this especially at that price point. If you want shrimp tacos you're better off ordering the shrimp skewer as you get six decent sized shrimp with two small corn tortillas. I'm very disappointed with the quality of food and lack of cleanliness here now and we won't be back. Massive bummer !"}
{"text":"Is there something I am not seeing in this place? Went there this evening with my dad not knowing that that it changed from chuys. Was not impressed at all. Sat down at a high top and a nice gentleman came up to us to explain everything but unfortunately could not understand a word he said except to deduct that we were to go to the bar to order. Place looked clean enough. Got the food, cheese enchiladas they were ok but nothing to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor and did not realize it is served on styrophome plates and plastic utensils. Not my kind of place, and I am not too fussy on where I eat, if I want a lower rate Mexican place I would rather go to Carolina's right down the way."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. First as Chuys and now CC's. Even better now! Check out my food pics."}
{"text":"The best mesquite broil in phoenix, hands down.  Love this place and come every time we visit phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, lunch and dinner! Always have football Sunday specials and happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"great place to go for happy hour drinks,joyce takes giving good customer service to a whole new level"}
{"text":"place is amazing! great atmosphere, great food, decent service and awesome patio! It is great that I can bring my dog's with me while I drink a few beers and eat some bomb food. THANKS GUYS!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful experience from the parking lot to the food! The service was awesome and only surpassed by the food! Also...who can beat a $4.75 long island this good! My new favorite place. Angela, Jan and Joyce are amazing!"}
{"text":"Within 15 minutes of eating all five of us felt sick  the salsa bar tasted three days old had a pure acidid taste from the spoiled tomatoes. Decided to continue and try the broiler fare and wish we didn't the fish tacos were hard not over cooked hard but tough hard like the fish was old. Everything else just tasted like salt.  The margaritas are not margaritas (tequila and lime) but instead tasted like watered down skinny girl wine."}
{"text":"First time visiting here and will most definitely be my last! The food was awful, my shrimp cocktail was warm and tasted like rubber, their were fish bones in my salsa, there was no service whatsoever, behind the bar (which you had to walk up to just to order your dinner) was filthy, the bartender could not pour a proper draft and no fruit for the Shocktop I ordered.... We left our food on the table, paid the bill and will never, ever return! Would never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a sat- the place was cute and colorful and probably kid friendly had it not looked dingy and grubby. There was chips and salsa which looked slightly old and greasy.  When we got the menus I saw my menu was splattered with some old (I hope) food on it. When we sat at the booth there was crumbs all over and food under table from previous diners.  We ordered burritos- mine was shrimp except had maybe 2 shrimps and a whole lot of cream sauce inside with no flavor. Didn't even eat 1/4.  My dining partner was also unimpressed.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"Have been going to Chuy's since the late 1990's.  

The new owners are doing a killer job.  Great food, cleaner and better service and they got rid of those nasty stuffed animals as table markers.  What is not to love?

Glad to see their business is doing well."}
{"text":"I had been to this place a few years ago several times when it was Chuy's and was not impressed. Now, it's my favorite quick stop for great casual grilled grub!  They have a good Friday fish fry, great Tri-tip and chicken combos plus cheap tasty Margaritas.  Fast service, friendly staff and great prices!"}
{"text":"It hurts me to write this because the food here is so delicious, but at this point, with the restaurant as filthy as it is, I think it's important. 
It's become an ongoing thing for my husband and I to sit down in a booth at CC's and glance over to where the cushion ends to see how much more food and grime has accumulated there. As far as I can tell, it just gets filthier and filthier. How can a restaurant not even notice this? How can a restaurant not pick up the cushions, let's say once a year, and clean the wood surfaces? It seems impossible but it's not. This has not been cleaned. They give small orange traffic cones customers to bring to the table for order delivery and even the cones are grimy and filthy. 
All unfortunate because the food is incredible. My husband gets the grilled white fish and it's such a huge portion it's normally falling off the plate. The chicken is excellent (though a \"half chicken meal\" consists of a leg, thigh and a breast cut in two). Love the salsa and chip bar. 
I would hate to see this place closed because of cleanliness. Can't they just clean it?"}
{"text":"My hubby and I always loved bike riding over to Chuy's and now love CC's.  The chicken strips were better, the french fries were better, the california tacos - the chicken was absolutely awesome but could have used a little more of the special sauce.  I missed the Chuy's BBQ sauce, and the salsa was really good, yet just a little heavy on the onion.  Can't wait to go back for cocktails as the liquor on hand was impressive!

Update:  Order the tamale plate!  It is incredible!!!  Super moist tamale, incredible flavor, I think I had pork and had it with green sauce."}
{"text":"Fish fry Friday, all breading, no fish. The fried fish tacos were the fish fry cut into taco size pieces. The salsa was so watery that it took me quite a while to scoop enough into a salsa cup. The spanish rice was very dry. I've been here many times before and it was pretty good, but tonight was bad!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim. The atmosphere is confusing, but thought it'd be worth trying if the food's good. You order at the bar registers and your food is brought to the table. We got the Cali chicken appetizer, it was void of any flavor and the chicken was yellow. Menu's description said it had green chili & cream cheese, but I didn't taste or see any of either. I got the chicken taco platter & my boyfriend got the pork burrito (it came enchilada style). The rice was too salty for my preference, beans are nothing to write home about, and the tacos weren't very flavorful. Wouldn't come back for the food at this price but it could probably be fun to come for drinks (it was $30 for an app + 2 plates)."}
{"text":"Cheap fast and good food. Don't let the dried boogers by the urinal keep you away this place is delicious!"}
{"text":"Can't you give a 6th Star?  This is the old Chuy's reborn.  We have been coming to this neighborhood bar/grill for over two decades, including with our children when they were in elementary school.  What a great place for Kids of all ages, including those over 50.  When Chuy's went to the dark side, we stopped going, but now that our favorite manager has bought the place, we are back all the time.  The food is great and inexpensive.  the 5 * margaritas also deserve a 6th star and the staff is like family."}
{"text":"Good food and really friendly staff! Joyce and her daughter do an amazing job. Food and beer are priced right. Haven't had a bad meal. My goto is the California tacos. Mesquite broiler chicken and tri-tip are amazing. Don't forget about the fish either. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch and ordered the sampler platter. The tri-tip was full of fat with no flavor, the small dark meat piece of chicken barely had any meat on it and even though my guest ordered her same meal with no cabbage or rice they still put it on her plate.  I will not be returning ...."}
{"text":"At first I was wary after the watery salsa and strange mystery sauces at the chip bar but as soon as my order arrived I was quite pleased. The portions were so generous I could only finish one taco and some bits of appetizers and sides. The atmosphere is really cute and the staff were 5 star on their own. The fish tacos were particularly lovely. Not a bad choice for a nice lunch. I would totally come back."}
{"text":"Eight year customer.  Food is consistently great; choices are mostly healthy.  Staff is friendly.  It is not pretentious.  The decor only matters for shallow folks who care what others think.  It's fun and you can watch a game with nice people.  What else do you want?"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, first as Chuy's and now as CC's and always a hit. I usually have their fish tacos but sometimes the shrimp or tri-tip. Always good choices. You can always help yourselves to chips and salsa to have with your meal and drinks. The chips used to be house made, not so sure any more, but good nevertheless. They have a full bar and plenty of TV's to watch sports. All in all a good, neighborhood joint to spend a casual Friday night or afternoon passing the time with friends, cold drinks and good food."}
{"text":"I would have given a good review thru the first 3/4 of the meal, but at that point my wife bit into a one inch long piece of wire (I believe it was from a grill brush) in her enchilada. I brought it to the cashier and she said thanks and shrugged it off...so we left and will never go back."}
{"text":"Really bad experience we will not be back unfortunately as it seems like a neat place with a lot of regulars. We ordered 2 entrees on a slow Saturday morning at approximately 11:01 AM. At 11:50 AM without any food in sight we closed out and left. We never got to even eat there due to an appointment at 1 PM. We thought we could eat and leave in about an hour or so. Instead we went back towards home and had some really decent food at Taco Mich on Cave Creek Rd. Still made it to the appointment at 1 PM. Sad thing is that the gentleman at the register was not surprised in the least bit."}
{"text":"Warm tortilla chips and fresh salsa... yummy. Order the mesquite grilled zucchini!  It's to die for. I tried a cinnamon toast crunch shot aka rumchata and fireball.... warmed me right up.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food, great pricing (try the twisted kilt beer on tap), and our server Janet was AMAZING, friendly, and well above and beyond what one would expect from even a white table cloth venue!"}
{"text":"I used to live in the area and was here a lot when it was Chuy's.
Tasty simple food and decent prices. Quick, casual and good drink specials. It's good to see some things just don't change.

Last night was my first visit since it's been CC's. 
Went in with my stepfather as we were both quite hungry and he was in the market for a margarita. We both opted for the combo - a skewer of BBQ shrimp, 1/4 grilled chicken and a couple strips of tri tip. Served with a cabbage salad, beans and choice of flour or corn tortillas for $10.

We grabbed some chips and salsa from the self serve bar, took our drinks out to the patio and chatted for a few minutes (maybe 10, tops) and our dinners were brought to our table.

Disposable plates and utensils (not a fan - for eating from or for the sake of the landfills) - a VERY casual Baja-beach-bar type atmosphere (I am a fan - this is a place I am comfortable walking into for dinner, even after working on a move and being covered in move-related-funk) - and a dog friendly patio! (HUGE PLUS!)

I don't get up to this area much anymore - but when I am, chances are I'll be down for a bite and a drink at CC's."}
{"text":"Formerly Cheuys!!  Great little hide-away dive for the absolute BEST food!!  Staff is always cool and laid back!!"}
{"text":"Cheap food doesn't make up for quality - especially in this instance. The one saving grace is the customer service. 

Pretty sure chicken comes pre-cubed/ pre packaged; food is otherwise bland and tasteless. Salsa virtually has no flavor - how is that even possible?

I wouldn't recommend this place, although I can see it appearing on TV with Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"Horrible food- got sick from the chorizo n beef tacos! This was our first time there & definitely our last!
The shrimp burrito was filled with onions and peppers.. 
only decent thing was the unlimited chips & salsa!"}
{"text":"Same basic program as the Chuy's that it replaced. They really cleaned it up inside and it looks like the trimmed the menu back. The food is the same, but the portions may be just a little smaller."}
{"text":"The food is okay.  The whole set up is kind of awkward.  You walk in and boom, the bar and cash register are right there and you feel like you need to decide what you want right off the bat because the door just opened and everyone is looking at you.  We went and grabbed a menu and a seat and then headed back up to order our food.   The food choices and prices are great, but the quality just isn't there.  Very, very loud place.  Oh, and Sunday they had a Bloody mary bar.  VERY generous on the vodka.  I would think the health board would have a problem with the serve yourself items that you put in your bloody mary.  Not too clean in that area.  YIKES.  We've been twice, and I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"The Low Down_

 Delicious Mesquite enhanced Meats with weak side dishes in a strange dated atmosphere that is self serve with friendly help. 



The full story-
I read in The New Times that Chef Binkley thinks that CC's Mesquite Broiler is one of Phoenix's Best kept secrets and he comes here for the White Fish Tacos so I wanted to check it out.

We entered and weren't sure if someone would seat us and figured out that you order at the bar and grab a small traffic cone with a number and seat yourself at a table or booth or patio. While your waiting you grab some chips and salsa from the complimentary salsa bar and then you take in the atmosphere. It's kinda like sea shore graffiti meets 1980's MTV with some big screen TVs and a tropical bar.

One of the bartenders runs out our food to us and it's mostly on disposable ware. I got the White Fish Taco Platter. I taste a piece of the fish and it's MIGHTY DELICIOUS with that mesquite taste. I received two smaller sized tacos, Spanish Style Rice and Lard Free Beans. The fish inside the tacos was very good. For me they were too heavy with the sauce but were tasty. I didn't like the rice or beans. The rice tasted very processed to the level were I couldn't eat it. The beans had some seasoning but tasted mostly like bean water....

My husband had the 1/4 lb Tri Tip Platter. I tasted a small piece and it was REALLY DELICIOUS! Tender, moist, beefy, mesquite...just delicious! He got more sides than I did. Spanish Style Rice, Lard Free Beans, Chopped Cabbage Salad and Tortillas. The rice and beans he was able to eat and he also ate mine but he agreed with me that the rice tasted very processed and he also said the beans lacked flavor.

I'll return sometime because the meats we tried were very tasty from the mesquite but will order dishes without rice or beans."}
{"text":"It's not a bad little neighborhood place. We have been here quite a few times. There are a few things that aren't too bad but my husband loves the chicken and tri-tip meal and I usually like to order the shrimp tacos. The beer is cold and the service is always good so that's a bonus. I wouldn't go as far to say it's ever our first choice, but it's not usually the last either."}
{"text":"I've come here a number of times trying to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but the broiler items are not made to order. I don't understand the appeal of marketing that the food is made on a broiler if it is not hot and/or prepared to order. Every time I've come here the chicken has been served at room temperature. The atmosphere is great, though. Very fun place to come and hang out."}
{"text":"The chicken is fantastic! But the real surprise is the beef tri tip!! I've been to some of the best BBQ restaurants and CC's ranks amongst the best! I'm a frequent visitor there because their food is consistently good."}
{"text":"All their meats are great since they are made on the woodfire mesquite grill.  Nice bar and I really like the chicken and steak fajitas."}
{"text":"Another place I'm so glad that I found!! I eat a lot of chicken, and I don't often use sauce. I love the mesquite grilled flavor of their chicken! And fish! So good!!! 
I like to get either fajitas (on special on Tuesdays for $7.50), or the Cali wrap with chicken, lettuce, pico, avocado, and I ask to hold the cheese and tortilla strips, no dressing either. Their Cali sauce is really good tho, ask for a side of that! Goes well with chicken, fish, or fries!
The Cali chicken tacos are also delicious. You really can't go wrong with chicken here.
There's help yourself to the salsa bar. Really nice fresh mix of tomatoes, onions, cilantro. Some spicy mix too, but I haven't tried it. 
Staff is very friendly. This is another place I've been frequenting while injured, and the girls ask how I'm doing. Not expected, but appreciated none the less.
There are different specials each night, tvs to watch the game, and it's very casual inside. I love CC's!
It's a lot like old Chuy's. I miss that place."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to think when I stopped here; I soon found out.

This place is like that little haunt you love to visit along the beach that has great chow and cocktails. 

The portions are ample! The food quality is awesome! Moreover, lacking water and sand, it still gives you that vibe  of that little fun bun.

The service I had here was really good and they were super nice. There is a full bar for additional needs (wink, wink) and Tri Tip sandwich here is incredible! Check them out it is rea good stop...

{"text":"The mesquite broiled whitefish tacos are The Bomb.  Definitely 5-stars.  It's smoked in a BBQ broiler so it has a nice distinctive taste and the fish quality was excellent.  Wow!  I did not expect that from this little place.

Update 02/04/2017:

The shrimp tacos were pretty good.  Also they have queso dip, which is pretty good.  You can taste the real cheese not like most places who use hydrogenated soybean oil with flavoring to simulate cheese flavor."}
{"text":"total dive bar... probably great if you are into that. Seems like everyone knows each other there... nice people too.

Not a place I'd avoid but not a place I'd seek out."}
{"text":"This place is good.  I can't say it's as good as when it was Chuy's, but they have kept the chef and some of the menu items, and it still tastes good.  Margaritas are amazing.  I love the Chicken salad as well.  Staff are really nice.  I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"We love this place, and I have no idea why I haven't written a review before now. Ive been coming here for about 15 years, long before it was CC's. Luckily when Chuys went under this place must have kept the menu pretty dang similar, at least from what I remember. The place is so cute inside, kind of unique, but has a fun surfer so cal vibe, cant go wrong there. I like how casual it is, yet its a sit down restaurant. You walk up, order at the bar, take a cone with your number on it, and your food is brought to the table. Unlimited chips and salsa, with a few toppings to chose from also. Up until this past visit, ive always gotten the chicken jumbo burrito, and let me tell you, jumbo is very fitting. I don't even want to know the calorie count lol. Its SO freaking good. This visit I decided to be more friendly on the waist line and get the two chicken tacos with rice and beans. I will say, for the same amount of money as the jumbo burrito, its significantly less meat, although the taco platter you get the two sides opposed to the burrito you get rice. Either way, the menu is cheap and simple, staff is friendly, and they run beer specials, win for mama!"}
{"text":"The place for Margarita Mondays with da girls...fun place..bartenders nice and friendly.  Offering complementary chips and salsa and baby pitchers of delicious margaritas with a straw...like who needs a glass?  Well. If you do, they'll give you one with a salted rim!!! Have not ordered food...who has time when there's a pitcher in front of you!"}
{"text":"I already wrote a long review, but Yelp is asking me to write another. Like I said when this happened before- what happened to my other review? Now I don't feel like writing another.

...used to be Chuy's. Live bands play at this pretty much local dive bar with seaside decorations.."}
{"text":"Ok been back several times for excellent fajita burritos, tri tip and shrimp.  That chicken broiler is fantastic.  Meals are affordable and drinks are reasonable but the taste of the chicken keeps us coming my back."}
{"text":"I am so bummed to be writing this, but I truly think that the owners need to keep a better eye on the patrons of their business. I came with a group of 10 people to watch Sunday football. We ordered food & beverages. The drinks and the prices were great. We even enjoyed (win or lose) talking to other complete strangers about how the football season was going. They had different games on several television screens which was great - UNTIL- mister obnoxious with the Dallas Cowboys jersey with Aiken on the back started mouthing off at the bar. He was by himself (1st clue) drinking a single beer & no food (2nd clue) drunk (3rd clue) but not a single staff member asked him to stop shouting across the bar and talking smack. Not a single person in the entire restaurant even mentioned the Dallas Cowboys but this idiot proceed to get in several peoples face about their teams, and even physically touched people provoking them. Three men sitting at the bar got up to go outside to avoid this jerk - and STILL not a single person working there told him to leave. What this means to me is that C.C.'s would rather not 86 a bad customer, but instead lose hundreds of dollars from good customers. This is a poor business decision because everyone- including children- who had to witness this behavior have lots of other options where to spend our money."}
{"text":"Last week, I went to CC's Broiler on Cave Creek for a 2nd time. Obviously the first time was good enough to make me go back; this second time was bad enough that I'll never go back. 

Met a friend there for happy hour and I had a couple of the $2 chicken tacos and they were absolutely delicious!  The beer could've been colder but it was a nice enough sports bar - and great $2 tacos.   (They cook their chicken on an open-flame broiler and these tacos were really, really  delicious.).  And remember, there's a Carolina's across the parking lot. That was a few weeks ago. 

Monday this week I was to meet my friend there at 6 o'clock I got there early and had a beer - this common American beer was difficult to find (?!) and was even less cold than the week before (strike #1). 

The chicken tacos not only had a completely different texture than the previous tacos, they had no flavor.  None. All I tasted was salsa and shell. And salsa. (strike #2)

Now, the reason this location made sense is that a) this is a sports-themed bar, and b) here were two - BIG - games on TV, both on  @5pm: Cardinal NFL football game and a MLB baseball playoff game. CC's Mesquite Broiler didn't know this and they had trouble finding the baseball game AND the football game, ON TIME, AT THE SAME TIME.  Sheesh. EXCUSE ME FOR WANTING TO WATCH THE BEGINNING OF THE GAMES. That's games, plural.  And CC's Mesquite Broiler missed 'em both. 

I'm having trouble expressing myself in a proper fashion about how disappointing it is that a sports bar can't keep track of cold beers and NATIONAL SPORTING EVENTS. 

One idea: concentrate a little more on the sports bar business right in front of you and just a bit less time on illegal employees and neck tattoos. Just a thought. Just my opinion. I could be wrong. 

No matter: I'm not coming back. 

Ever. 

And that leaves me at least 10,000 other choices for tacos. Nice going, CC's Mesquite Broiler.   Turned a fan into a walking Yelp 1 star review."}
{"text":"I panicked when Chuy's went out of business. We were regulars of their happy hours and boozy Sunday breakfasts. But luckily CC's is almost identical to Chuy's with the menu, pricing, and specials. 

They still have their free chip and salsa bar, amazing HH specials, dirt cheap breakfasts, and $1.50 build your own bloody marys on Sundays. Woo-hoo! 

Food is slightly better but as one reviewer stated portions are slightly smaller.

I think the service is better than Chuy's. They were very warm and friendly. 

The strawberry margaritas, while a great bargain, were a little too sugary for me. I miss the mix they had at Chuy's. 

Patio is dog friendly! We can watch a game on one of the TV's outside while chilling with our dog at our feet. Order a pitcher or 2 and that is a good time to me."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour prices on drinks and really enjoyed their tri tip chili . Staff was friendly and the young bartender guy was hilarious \" forgot his name \""}
{"text":"Okay, this is apparently my job to tell the whole Phoenix and beyond area to please check this place out! The two owners are (from what I heard amazing women that were here when Chuy's was around) awesome! This place has the same wonderful food, same wonderful tacky, yet fun decor and same great service. Still same, walk up, order at the bar, now you get a cone, not a stuffed animal and grab your chips, awesome salsa and don't forget their seasoning for the chips!! 

I had my dog with me, they were very accommodating and patio is nice, has a small bar opening to it too. The girl that took my order brought my pup a bowl of water and I ordered her two drumsticks. She loved them!! (yes PETA, I deboned them before giving them to her) I tried them too, super perfect!

I ordered the grilled mesquite shrimps tacos plate. Seriously, my favorite meal of all time and nothing has skipped a beat from over 17 years ago.
Sooooo good!! wouldn't change a thing!! and seven bucks for a pitcher of free pour margarita is unheard of!! It is a perfect mixture of not too sweet, not too week and all happy greatness :)

I am so happy CC's is here. I am so excited it is the same as the food I had growing up at Chuy's and I love the fact that they have kept the same awesome everything!!

Food=RAD
Staff=Amazing
Price=Un-Beatable, my bill for dogs two chicken legs, a shrimps taco plate with rice and beans and a pitcher of margarita amaziness = $21.00!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

Only thing missing was my  love :( my better 2/3's of me...."}
{"text":"Update - 6/25/16-- Tri-tip sandwich is great. Bread is great (wish they'd grill it over mesquite too!). Chili that comes with sandwiches is very good but comes in a thimble-sized cup. 

The \"small\" sized grilled chicken salad is an amazing value at $7. Lots of chicken.

Grilled zucchini is also very tasty.

---

4/2016:

Only gotten better in last 4 years (see prior review) - still $3.99 small pitchers on HH (which is every day from 3-6 and during all college and pro football games). Happy hour also knocks off about $0.50 on other drinks (small pitchers of margaritas are a deal). 

Still super friendly service. Still mom and pop. 

Free chips and salsa!

Only 1 TV on patio but otherwise it's a nice patio. 

Will be back for brunch and $2 build your own bloody Marys. Food looks excellent."}
{"text":"Get the combo.You will thank me. 
      I have been coming here for over 10 years since it was Chuey\"s. My go to meal is the trip tip with grilled shrimp, coleslaw,  pinto beans and rice with flour or corn tortillas. Plus free chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  The food is great and the people are very nice.  Try the chicken tortilla soup!  Its the best in town!  The owners should really improve the outside lighting and signage to make the place look safer and more welcoming because it could scare some people away.  Once inside it's all great!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious good food, fairly priced. Complimentary chips + salsa. Very clean restrooms."}
{"text":"When we take the family out, this is where we usually go. It's not fancy, but it's just a good comfortable family place. The chicken is REALLY good!!!"}
{"text":"This company is under new ownership. Everything is the same basically as it was when it was Chuy's. However, I guarantee with new owners, there will be improvement.  Always enjoyed going in to have a pitcher of margaritas and kick'in it with the locals. Went in today to see what's up and as far as I can tell all is well."}
{"text":"This place has friendly staff, great food, and wonderful margaritas as well. Everybody has a smile on their face and I've been going here almost every week for the past few months it's amazing."}
{"text":"Great food for very very fair prices. The chicken & the tri-tip are excellent. Good size portions. Caz atmosphere. Try the chicken salad... Excellent."}
{"text":"Happened upon Ccs while exploring my new city and have been looking for a place that does a solid charred...anything.  The reviews   mixed so I decided to try it myself.  Whimsical decor, random video games in the corner a salsa bar that did not look too sanitary but we tried some mild salsa anyway. Chunky cut veggies and watery tomato base.  Ordered a grilled salmon platter and a shrimp skewer on the side, enchiladas with beef tip and a cheese quesadilla.  I specifically asked my salmon be cooked rare well I received the exact opposite.  Salmon was so overcooked it tasted like chicken.  When I said something i was advised the cook didnt want to undercook it. Wrong answer   This platter came with a salad which was chopped salad from a bag.  Tortillas - store bought and the enchilada was OK.  The shrimp were OK also what I can say is the \"mesquite\" flavor their name boasts did come through in the flavor of my salmonchicken and the shrimp.  The servers were SUPER friendly and attentive, music playing over head nostalgic all my 80s faves but the star if it all....STRAWBERRY LEMONADE!!! Soooooo tasty with free refills???!!!  It was the silver lining to this meal.  I think the way to go here is with the tri-tips but I doubt I'll ever find out as I don't think ill be back."}
{"text":"This was a Chuys in its past life. Same decor, menu expanded. Neighborhood going down hill. 
Kinda old & dingy, but super nice people serving, bartender etc. 
I was in the area in business late and stopped in. 
Won't come back, I'll find something else. 

Problems with beer tap, beer tasted stale/ old. 
I wish the owner luck !!"}
{"text":"We go to CC's every Wednesday and absolutely love this place! They have so many delicious food options that are so tasty and healthy! We love the live music that plays every other Wednesday. The employees are amazing and always so friendly! CC's is our favorite restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We, like many others, have been going to this place before it was CC's, when it was Chuy's. I'm thinking it has been a couple decades by now. We loved Chuy's!! So happy CC's opened up and carried on the tradition!!

We typically order the chicken and whitefish. Other items are good too! 

As far as another poster trying to say that the salsa bar tasted three days old, I have to laugh out loud!! This place is too busy to have their salsa last for hours, much less days!!!

Anyhow, give it a try! It is a dive bar with good food!!"}
{"text":"I drive by CCS every time I go to church and haven't paid much mind. One night we decided to finally stop in.... OMG! Amazing! It's very laid back... I didn't really goto Chuys a lot but, let me tell you CCs is where it's at this is a true Phoenix Mom and Pop GEM! I love the salsa bar and how I can keep getting up for more chips or salsa and they are very kid friendly.. The strawberry lemonade was to DIE FOR... The food is GREATLY Priced. I can not wait to go back.. Seriously they are sooooooooo much cheaper than rubios and other competitors! I love CCs! The staff was so personable and nice!!!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to love this place because it's so close to our home.  We went for Happy Hour. This is a dive bar, which is fine, they have their place, but the set up is a bit confusing. You have to order food and drinks at the bar and they will bring the food to your table. 

We ordered a large pitcher of mango margaritas and two quesadillas. The bar tender misunderstood and made regular margaritas. She said no problem, I can fix it, and dumped some mango purée into the mix, rather than start over. The result was a congealed, gloppy mess. 

The quesadillas were nothing special, perhaps a little overdone and dry. Hard to imagine a Mexican food place that can't get the basics down. 

All in all, it seemed like a good place for cheap buds with regulars hunkered down at the bar. But I do t think we will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorite neighborhood go-to places for lunch.  We eat here often. We have many items we enjoy but my absolute favorite is the shrimp dinner plate. The shrimp are marinated, char broiled over mesquite and SO full on flavor. Served over flavorful rice with sides of plain beans and simple cabbage salad type slaw served with your choice of corn or flour tortillas.  Super casual and friendly local place for families but with full bar service. (Other favorites include grilled whitefish, as dinner plate or tacos, and chicken, as dinner plate or salad).  You will find something to enjoy for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Tues for fajitas!  I had chicken, my friend had pork. They were both great. Plenty of food.

{"text":"the salsa bar is good, free chips and salsa.

{"text":"Met a friend here on a early Friday afternoon for lunch! I have to admit I was a little apprehensive at first. Arrived at 11:30 to find only 5 cars in the parking lot, 2 of the 5 ours.

When walking in was greeted by a gentleman! Told us to help ourselves to the chip and salsa bar. Chips were fresh but had a sprinkling of what appeared to be seasoned salt. Salsa was fresh.

A quick look told me the place was clean. Tables washed and floors free of any food. Multiple TV's on with various sporting events. Outside patio for nicer weather. Restrooms dated but again clean. A erase board over the counter gave the daily specials for the week. Full bar. Decor is a little corny, surf shack style.

We ordered at the counter. One cheese quesadilla, one half order of the grilled chicken salad, two iced teas. Took seats in a booth

Took about 10 minutes to get our food. Friend said her quesadilla tasted like it was microwaved and in all honesty it looked like it. Usually when you order a quesadilla it has the little bit of browning and crunch when you bite. Hers did not, but it did come with sour cream, quacamole and a small container of pico.

My four star review is based solely on the chicken salad and customer service.

First, the salad was huge...and it was a half order, for $7, a great value, especially when you add the free chips. It was fresh chopped lettuce, cabbage, cilantro, whole pinto beans, cheese, avocado slice and two half slices of tomatoand still warm sliced chicken breast. Dressing was a taco French. A little spicy, a little sweet. Salad was excellent.

The gentleman came to our table several times to make sure our drinks had not run dry and provide refills. He had a great attitude and greeted everyone as they walked in the door. 

This place is definitely a keeper on my list. Would love to come back for happy hour and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Couldn't get either person at the register to understand their own menu.  It clearly said substitute item for a price. They said we don't substitute that. I showed them and the lady said well it's a dollar more. Um yes I clearly read that to you from your menu! We left and didn't order there. Lady rudely said have a nice day. Yes I will since won't be eating here."}
