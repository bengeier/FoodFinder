{"text":"I've been here several times but never for dinner. Some friends suggested meeting me here for a bite one night . They have a very eclectic menu. Everything from Irish, stick to your ribs kind of food to Mexican influenced yummies and of course American pub favorites. I had the Fish tacos and they were fantastic. The fish was baked not fried and the ingredients were all very fresh. I really enjoyed my meal and I highly recommend it. I always forget about this place but I wish I didn't.  The service is excellent and you can't beat the Pub Charm.   Kudos! Lovin it!"}
{"text":"Galway Hooker is a fun place.  The interior is comfortable and attractive, and makes one, like me, who has never actually been in a pub in Ireland feel like this is what one must be like.  The menu has lots of choices we Americans expect to find in Irish pubs, and the food is quite good.  The place gets crowded and loud, but the young and attractive wait staff work hard to keep up.  The food is better than everything else about the place would suggest.  There is a good selection of beers, and an adequate selection of inexpensive wines."}
{"text":"Great service and food was delicious. The mac n cheese is the best I've ever had. My big fish sandwich was tasty and not overcooked."}
{"text":"I ordered from their seasonal summer menu. Curry grilled chicken breast. A little wait before we got the food. Chicken was well seasoned, freshly cooked and moist. Came with cold couscous salad which was ok but not the best. Used venue for gatherings for work. Good place to have a drink or two with colleagues. Straight sodas not recommended as they are a little on the flat side."}
{"text":"Great new menu with a lot of great food.  You can enjoy traditional Irish dishes as well as plates like fish tacos. The beer selection is also fantastic with a lot of specials."}
{"text":"I love the Hooker. It's perfect if you're looking for a spot to watch the game, dine with the family or have a nice date.  Staff is top notch. MacKenzie and the rest of the bar staff are all very personable.  Sunday brunch is awesome - great bloody Mary's and mimosas.  I recommend the Hooker's famous nachos, the Burger, salmon or Cajun pasta. The salmon panini is also very good."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in the world! Love the comedy club, 1/2 price wine nite and 2.50 drafts! I would come to eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Galway Hooker.  The vibe is cozy and warm and the food is amazing.  We have been to this restaurant at least eight times and each time the food is perfection and the service is spot on.  The open face meatloaf sandwich wrapped in bacon is scrumptious over mashed potatoes and if you are looking to be a bit healthier then the California Chicken sandwich with avocado and sun dried tomatoes is awesome.    For side items, the sweet potato chips and jalapeno mac n cheese are fabulous.  My husband has tried the burgers and my dad the fish n chips and I have heard no complaints.  Not really an ideal place for kids because of the noise and crowd but we often take our young daughter and just try to go early.  GREAT outdoor seating.    The food is fresh and they try to keep it as local as possible. The servers are very knowledgeable  and the managers often stop by to check on each table.  I would say the only cons is that the music can be very loud and the new menu is somewhat limited.  I am okay with those because their ingredients are so fresh-it makes since to have less offerings."}
{"text":"Our family really enjoyed Galway Hooker.  We visited on a Wednesday night, when kids eat free.  Everyone had the fish & chips, which was very good.  The adult portions were huge and the kid's portion was more than enough to feed by 7 year old and my 3 year old.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating.  The dining room is not overly large. We were seated in a table directly next to the bar, which wasn't ideal with the kids (I think they may have learned a few new words), but it was OK.   Furniture and deco are traditional irish pub design.  Our waitress was friendly and took good care of us.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere and good beer selection but there were too few hookers for a place that has \"hooker\" right there in the name.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"For the past two years when I stop in and get a draft beer it has a mildew aftertaste. Yes, you would think I would learn my lesson (and I have) but I kept thinking they would fix the problem. No such luck! I have resorted to bottled beer only at this place.  I have repeatedly told the bartender's that there is something wrong with their lines. I had an OMB from a nearby bar and it tasted perfect. Stopped into Galway and ordered the exact same draft beer, mildew aftertaste. Thinking it was the OMB line the bartender offered me a different draft beer. I had a Smithwicks,  same mildew aftertaste. No it's not me!! I drink enough draft beer to know when it tastes good vs bad. I also had other friends taste my beers and they agreed with the weird taste.  What really bothers me is that I have said something each time to the bartender and she says she'll tell 'someone' about it. Yet, it never gets fixed.  Please, please, please.... clean your lines and equipment!!!  You have too many great draft beers to have them taste like mildew!"}
{"text":"Asked for well done salmon and this is what I got....see pic.  Microwaving my salmon now to make it edible :-("}
{"text":"Great place! love the atmosphere and the fun live music! Jalapeno Mac and Cheese was great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love to eat here when we get tired of the same old-same old. This place is a warm, friendly, authentic old style pub (short for Public House) that has excellent food, good prices and excellent service. On Wednesday nights, the Comedy Zone, upstairs offers live performances of both new and also, established comedians."}
{"text":"Ok the good part:   Food is TERRIFIC, had the shepherds pie and some of the brisket my girlfriend had. They have a lot of beers on tap and the place was decorated like an Irish pub, and being Irish-American from an Irish-American city I know an Irish bar.  Down part:   Customer service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. The waitress sat us down, then we waited....and waited. Finally I had to flag her down just to get our drinks but by that time we already know what we wanted. As we were waiting for the meal, I see her over at the bar flirting with the bartender basically the whole time we were waiting. Finally the meal came out but was brought out by one of the chefs. Like I said above, meal was delicious. After we were done we did some more waiting for the bill. I looked around and now she's with one of the other waitresses gossiping behind the bar. I had to get up and walk over to the bar and get her attention. After a few minutes of waving at her she finally acknowledged me she had a confused look on her face why I was kind of angry when  I asked her for the check. Left her a $0.05 tip which is too bad cause I normally tip around 25% if your good.  Therefore I'd love to come back when they get their service straightened out."}
{"text":"Great food and a fun atmosphere.  On several occasions the staff has gone out of their way and above and beyond to accommodate my guests and I. I can't speak highly enough about Galway Hooker."}
{"text":"Ordered mac and cheese with a side of green beans! They were perfect. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Excellent!   Excellent! Great FOOD!  Great Service!  Great atmosphere!  Will go back for more! The wait staff were very friendly and the owner very nice.   Really like the fact that they used fresh LOCAL produce and meats.  I know they have a comedy club there also...have to go back and check it out.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is another restaurant with a huge local cult following- I still don't get it. I think I'm not the target market for this establishment so maybe that's where my dislike comes from (seems targeted at families or the 55+ crowd)  The food that I've tried there has all been literally horrible. Worse than Rusty Rudder terrible. I don't send food back, ever, especially appetizers, but it happened here. I don't understand where all these amazing reviews come from.   The bar is tiny, like eight stools max, and its tough to get a drink (decent drink specials, nothing to write home about). I have not sat in the dining room and have zero desire to do so. The building itself is super cool, I hear its imported from Europe somewhere....probably Ireland...  The Comedy Zone is okay, comedians are hit or miss, but its set up weird (all big round tables of eight, so at least two people will have to wrech their neck to see the stage) and the wait staff is sssllllooowwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really wish they had multiple sizes of tables, I don't like sitting with six randoms when we're out on a date. This is the first comedy place I've seen set up so generically, like they could turn it into a middle school prom on a moments notice if they wanted. The waitstaff for the comedy zone is horribly inexperienced or undertrained, I had to ask our same waitress four times for my first beer, and it was obvious she just really didn't care that much. Which was super irritating because its a good 1.5 hours of waiting for the comedian to start after the doors open.  I would go back to the Comedy Zone for free (not worth the $10 ticket price), but I've pretty much had my fill of fails for the Galaway Hooker. I think people like it because the name sounds slightly controversial with the word \"hooker\" in the title...seriously, that's got to be it, because there isn't a single thing other than the cool building that makes this place worth while. (\"hooker\" is referring to fishing, btw)"}
{"text":"When traveling its hard to find places that make you feel at home. You know the type of service I'm talking about... I felt very comfortable and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's been a great experience each time. I've received excellent service and the food is truly delicious. Love the shepherd's pie! Today I went  for the Mother's Day brunch and the atmosphere was perfect.There was a fantastic and very tasty buffet selection. Eggs benedict, chicken and waffles, prime rib, cheesy eggs, biscuits and gravy, bacon and hash browns..just to name a few! My compliments to the chef.There was also a band playing and it was just the right music for the occasion. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips plus a great selection of cold beer.  One of my local favorites."}
{"text":"We were there around 5:00pm on a Friday.  The restaurant was extremely noisy, hard to carry on a conversation.  The waitress was exceptional and really was the highlight of the evening.  The only thing Irish about Galway was the sign that said it was an Irish Pub.  The music was rock which I love but it did not fit the advertised sign.  The food was very average."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and had the house special burger and fries. Both were cooked properly and very generous portions. Service was fast and very friendly. Will definitely stop in again when in the area."}
{"text":"I took a cross country tour of Ireland a couple years ago and despite the lush green sights, the Blarney stone, and the tour of the Guinness factory, my fondest memories were checking out the local pubs at every town I came to and the unique atmosphere each one contained. I collected pub glasses and matchbooks from all of them, and discovered for the first time Guinness's sister beer Smithwicks. So when my wife and I settled into Huntersville, we found out about this place which boasted the whole bar was shipped over from Ireland piece by piece so I couldn't wait to check it out.   Turns out this place is the real deal, you walk up to a authentic stone pub in the middle of an otherwise common street near Birkdale. The inside of the restaurant is cozy and warm, and they have a nice outside seating area with tables as well. The menu is not completely dedicated to Irish fare, they actually have a lot of interesting mixes with a dash of Irish style to them such as their take on Canada's favorite \"poutine\" dish. They also have a very unique appetizer in their gourmet popcorn. If you are looking for bangers and mash though don't worry they have it along with of course Guinness on tap, and if you haven't had it before I recommend a Smithwicks, pronounced \"Smiticks\". Not a lot of places carry that in Charlotte, so it was nice to see it here.  Unfortunately they don't have my other favorite Irish beer which is Beamish, but it is very similar to Guinness.  A couple other things I should mention is they put on one of the best St. Patrick's Day parties in Charlotte. They team up with the other bar near by and rope off the entire block and throw a party in the street. They even setup a bar in the median with flat screen TVs so you won't miss any March Madness action. They also throw a great New Years Eve party, for around $50 per person, you get all you can eat, drink (beers, and liquor), and they have a dance floor upstairs with a live DJ, from what I can remember of the night it was a blast or so my wife tells me!   Anyway definitely a place to check out if you have not been there before, and one last note they also have the LKN Comedy Zone on the top floor that has had some big acts, we saw Screech from Saved by the Bell, Pauly Shore, Tommy Davidson, Jamie Kennedy, and Aisha Tyler there."}
{"text":"I have have many beers here thru the years. Have had many of the dishes. A few months back I was ordered the fish fry and asked them what kind of fish it was. They indicated it was Panga. Never having heard of panga I googled it and found out it comes from toxic contaminated waters in Vietnam. I brought this up to the manager who indicated he wasn't aware of this. I went back today and they are still serving panga fish. I guess they don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Cornelius, NC and to Galway Hooker, an Irish Pub named for Galway Bay in Ireland.  Dora here. Actually, the entire pub was deconstructed and shipped from Ireland. Cool, huh? And it fits so well in this mixed use neighborhood.   We visited on a Sunday for brunch. By the time we left, most of the tables outside were full. A beautiful day for outdoor dining!  For my lunch I chose the Bangers & Mash: grilled banger sausage, buttermilk mashed potatoes, brown gravy, crispy onion strings and a side of jalapeno mac and cheese. The bangers were firm and meaty. The mashed potatoes were fresh with skins mixed in, and the brown gravy was hearty and warm. The highlight of this dish was the jalapeno mac and cheese, creamy and delicious with a perfect heat level.  Dora here. Perfect heat level? Coughing...the mac and cheese was in-your-face, clean-out-your-head HOT! Honestly, I should've waited to try the mac because it skewed my taste buds for everything else. Wiping sweat from my face...  Some of you might be wondering what's underneath that yummy looking fluff of mashed potatoes.   Quite a generous portion of hamburger, peas, carrots onion and brown gravy smothered in creamy mashed potatoes. I devoured all the potatoes but couldn't finish the stuffing. Good and filling, but not jazzed with flavor like I expect from an Irish pub.  What's your favorite Irish dish?  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"We love the hooker!!!  This is a legit Irish pub.  Having traveled all over Ireland, this place is exactly what you would find in there (except the food at the hooker might be a bit better).  Get the fish and chips.  They are the best you will find anywhere.  The strawberry salad is also exceptional.  Actually, everything we've had is great.  Live music, a great atmosphere, excellent service, cold beer.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I went for a busy Sunday brunch and the waitress were extremely busy! The manager on duty was backing them up to make sure they was no delay for their customers. This is great service! The food was better! I would recommend eating any time Sunday brunch, lunch or dinner! The philly is awesome FYI"}
{"text":"This place got me SOOO sick!! I ate the fish n'chips.  It had nice flavor, but I think the tartar sauce was the culprit. By the time I got home after eating, I was sick. I will never go back. Can't eat at a place that serves spoiled food."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give more than 3 stars. 6 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars. Galway Hooker used to be our favorite restaurant in the area: great food, great beer, great service, great atmosphere. None of that has changed, but in the last couple of months, they have cut the portions WAY down, but kept the prices the same. In other words, it has become so much more expensive for what you get. Their fish & chips was the best I've ever had, and it still is. But instead of getting a full piece of fish as you used to, now you get a \"log\" only a few inches long and a small handful of fries. Frankly, it isn't worth the money anymore. Go for the flavors and atmosphere, but don't expect to feel like you are getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"People are nice but the food is not good and they only play local football games. No NFL ticket. Live next door so I've given the food a few tries but it's always pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Went to Brunch on Sunday what an amazing brunch menu! Service was awesome spot on the entire time!   My fiancé Had the Vanilla Brûlée French Toast which was by far one of the best ways I have ever tasted French Toast!   I had an amazing meal started with a cup of the Clam Chowder I am really a Chowder Snob it was so good great portion Clam in every bite! Then I had the Filet Benedict same as an Eggs Benedict but instead of Ham they replaced the ham with a Filet Cooked your way! The hollandaise was so smooth perfect topping!   My first time to the Galway Hooker and it will not be my last!"}
{"text":"Moving to the area and gave this place a try last week. Very nice outdoor patio atmosphere and we had good service. The calamari was great! Will be back to try more on the menu and check out the bar area."}
{"text":"They definitely know how to properly pull a pint of Guinness.  Some places have funky pipes, but this was one of the best Guinnesses (or Guinneai?) I've had on this side of the Atlantic.  I haven't had the food yet, but if it's as authentic as the atmosphere and Guinness - I'm sure it will be great."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time I've enjoyed it. I love there beer section and there fish and chips are amazing. Great place for the area with shorter wait times compared to most"}
{"text":"Noreen is Back! This happy fact bumped the Hooker right on up to a 5. The \"Irish\" is back in the pub... Classic pub interior of dark, well-worn woodwork. A stone fireplace lends it an affable cheeriness. It sports a massive wraparound patio with extensive seating for warm weather or standing space to indulge your tobacco craving. I do like the layout and feel of the place.   They pour a good pint of Guinness (I've had Guinness in 40 states - bit of a connoisseur) and a good drink. You'll find an interesting mix of folks here. Locals, folks from the hotel, blue and white collar and everything in between.  The service has always been excellent and the staff take very good care of their customers.   I haven't eaten there, so I cannot yet comment on the grubbage.  A spot like this is a go-to choice for drinks - one or many... Dig It Indeed!   This treasure of a place also sports a comedy club upstairs. A true find for an area that doesn't sport a lot of night life.   Slainte!"}
{"text":"Only Irish about this place is the decor and that's not saying much. This place has nachos on the menu. This is a karaoke and sports bar. I had a lot of hope in this place when it was being built. Pretty much a failure. The lake trash has tainted this place. Go to Ri Ra's or Connely's on Fifth if you want a good Irish pub."}
{"text":"Huntersville,  NC (and surrounding),  has caused the 1st 3 of my 3 reviews on yelp. I came across this  'Irish pub'  on yelp,  and instantly thought \"I want a Shepherd's Pie\".  Instantly assigning an expectation of how good the food should taste.  The Shepherd's pie (and black&tan,  and calamari appatizer)  was up to par, and greatly shadowed the service.  I would definitely suggest Galway to a friend,  however I felt rushed by the waitresses (constantly questioning if we wanted our check, as well as bringing our entrees SECONDS after our appetizer). The excellent food, drinks,  and politeness FAR outweighed the rushed feeling,  but it was worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Best Irish pub outside of the city. Good beers, good food and great service. My friends go to the hooker on a regular basis and I go every once in a while with them. They always have good live music and everyone always has a great time. Their drinks are a bit pricey but they pour a good stiff drink. Probably have the best car bombs as well. Also check out there comedy club upstairs. They have some big acts that come around every once in a while."}
{"text":"Come here all the time with our two young kids.  Amazing bar food.  Pretzel is authentic...not your run of the mill frozen beer pretzel.  Homemade and comes with two different sauces. Wife always gets shepherds pie and loves it.  I often get the bourbon beef medallions or fish and chips but have had it all and love it all. Corn beef a bit too salty the one time I had it, my only Complaint.  Outstanding otherwise.  Solid craft beer selection, not great, but solid."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots in the area! Absolutely adore the  outside patios which are especially wonderful when the weather outside is comfortable! Customer service is always good and the food is great! A few of our favorite dishes are the Corn Beef and Cabbage, The Shepherds Pie, and the Fish and Chips. I do think most things on the menu are probably pretty good though! The Pretzel with cheese dipping sauce and the sweet potato mustard dipping sauce appetizer is really yummy too. My teenage son who loves to get a good Clam Chowder orders it here often. They also have great drink specials all the time if you are into those and don't forget to check out the dessert menu. They have some fun dessert options that are really good!   The music and extra large Jenga on the patio is really nice if you happen to be there when they have someone playing during the summer months. This is one of my favorite times to go and I wish these fun evenings lasted a little longer into the more mild weather of fall when it is super comfortable to sit outdoors.   If you are looking for somewhere to enjoy a beautiful evening or to enjoy a nice weekend brunch in the Lake Norman area give this place a try I do not think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Try the calamari appetizer.  It's amazing.  The shrimp and grits was awesome.  The male in our picture had corn beef and sauerkraut and was very, very pleased.  You have to try the Shepherd's Pie.  It's huge, filling and delicious.  I highly recommend this place.  Atmosphere is awesome.  Comedy Zone upstairs but I haven't been up there."}
{"text":"Unique venue. I attended an event here that was held in the banquet room upstairs. The food was great and the staff was attentive."}
{"text":"No complaints here! I had a delicious meal- shepherd's pie with a side of beer battered onion rings. I had this paired with their \"special beer on tap,\" which is $2.50 regardless of what it is. (Happened to be Guinness Blonde)  Service was excellent. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Nice atmosphere too. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the more unique Irish pubs I've had the pleasure of visiting in the sense of restaurant style. It is a great venue with a decor that matches that of an old tyme pub in Ireland with a modern twist. This place even has a fire place!  The business has quite a bit to offer its customers and even though the location could be better, there is much appeal here otherwise. The menu is comprised of a decent variety and like many Irish pubs, has more authentic Irish dishes- I'm a big fan of these. The food is absolutely amazing, great appetizers and entrees. A couple favorites of mine are the Irish Eggrolls, Dublin Fries, Hooker Burger, & Irish Club. The Jalapeno Mac & Cheese as a side item is a must! Perfect combo of mixed white cheddar, jalapenos, green onions, and a baked yellow cheddar! Mmm.  The spinach & artichoke is also great here. If you go over to their website, you can request to be in their fan club and they will send you a free spinach & artichoke voucher.   Beer selection is great, lots to choose from. Service is pretty good to excellent if I must say so myself. Service is maintained even when busy.  Overall, a great Irish eatery & pub!  galwayhookerpub.com"}
{"text":"This was the first time my Wife and I had eaten here. She had the fish and chips, and I had the corned beef and cabbage, both excellent quality. I liked that they have a great selection of beer and Irish whiskey. The service was great and everyone was very friendly. Upon walking up to the front door, we were greeted with the door being opened for us, which was greatly appreciated as I had my one year son in my arms. I would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone looking for some great quality Irish food and excellent service. My Wife and I will be going back quite often. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are well worth what you are spending."}
{"text":"What a fun place to be for St. Patrick's day celebration. The crowd, the band, the dancing as well as people watching/meeting were so much fun and lively. You don't need to be in Savannah, GA  to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, but just being here is so much fun!!! Also, the tent set up was perfect to accommodate so many people each year."}
{"text":"Went there pat night and had very good fish and chips with a great Guinness speciality beer.  Started with a big pretzel that can with dipping cheese. Michael the bartender was so friendly - made a single diner feel comfortable!!"}
{"text":"What a great place and worth the 30 minutes I drove over to get here. The fish and chips did not disappoint and the service was spot on. Love the ambiance of the place. The only thing that would make it better is a deck overlooking the lake."}
{"text":"This is the model by which all Irish pubs in America should aspire to become. Drinks, decor, atmosphere, service...they all remind you of the greatness that lies just across the Atlantic.  Galway has a plethora of little nooks and crannies to enjoy your favorite pint, one of the true reflections of a real Irish pub. Drinking out in the open with your friends is done at the bar, not the entire pub/restaurant, which most places get wrong. The pubs in Ireland are full of little \"rooms\" or closed off tables where people can not only drink but talk. While we are a very social race, we do enjoy privacy from time to time.  The patio is certainly one of their best features, and one of the best in the Lake Norman area as well. While the view isn't anything spectacular, it's nicely shaded off by lots of hanging baskets and a great cast-iron fence. It's a really comfy area, especially at night when the bar area fills up.  The bartenders here are real pros, and you can tell they take their pints seriously. As anyone who really knows how to pour a stout does, they hold your pint until it has settled, instead of just handing it to you while the head is still making its way to the top. They also have that over the top jovial spirit that we Irish are known for, which makes paying for the pint that much easier."}
{"text":"Had brunch for first time today. Exceptional. Great service from a training waiter. Such a full menu. Had Belfast breakfast! Just delicious. Best creamy cheesy grits. I'm an expert on this. Did not have coffee, sorry I missed such an important part of breakfast. Next time. Whole family enjoyed their meal. Going back for comedy zone June 28! That's a great aspect of Galway Hooker. We really like the vibe and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Eight of us decided to meet here for dinner on a weeknight.  We all enjoyed the food we ordered and the service was excellent so no complaints there.  However, the noise level inside was deafening and we couldn't even hear one another across the table!  If you are going here to be able to have a conversation with your tablemates, this is the wrong place!  If you are going to drink, celebrate and whoop it up, then you have struck gold here!  If it hadn't been so cold we would've sat outside where the noise level was much less so we'll definitely go back when the temp goes up!"}
{"text":"Cozy ambience with nice seating in front of a fire for shrilly weather or outdoor patio in summer.  Hearty and savory pub fare that's deliciously prepared and served with friendly and attentive care."}
{"text":"Went here for the very first time today and had a delicious brunch! I ordered the chicken and waffles, which was a generous portion, and the Sriracha infused maple syrup made the dish even more unique. I also ordered a side of hashbrowns, which were very well seasoned and were much more exciting than normal, bland hashbrown potatoes. My husband ordered crème brûlée French toast and he enjoyed it, but the portion was particularly small. He was not satisfied after finishing his meal and it did not even come with a side. I ended up sharing some of my entrée and hashbrowns with him. The food was excellent and we will definitely be back! I would love to have brunch there again and I also want to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"Very hit or miss on service and quality and temperature of food served. All very casual. I would go if friends or family wanted to go but this would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Our first time here. A great meal! The fish tacos are yummy. My husband had a fish sandwich with the asparagus side. He loved it. The atmosphere is fun and the patio is charming."}
{"text":"My wife and I, who eat at the Galway pretty regularly went there tonight and discovered that they had introduced a new menu. I don't know if there are new owners or a new chef, but whatever it is, its not working. If you want to know the new menu just take the old menu and remove all the best dishes. No McCune Beef Medallions, no chicken piccatta, no salmon with dill sauce, the green beans are completely different (i.e. bad), no jalapeno mac and cheese, and probably worse of all no seafood combo. If that is not bad enough the prices are now outrageous. We tried one of the new appetizers, the bacon pimento cheese dip, which was pretty good, but we weren't given enough bread to eat it. The entrees were brought out while we were still eating our appetizer and the waitress barely checked on us......on a Tuesday night. If you want a similar experience without the noise and better service I would recommend a chain, because that is what the Galway now resembles instead of the excellent restaurant it used to be. So give your money to Chili's, Hickory Tavern, or Applebee's, all the atmosphere at half the price."}
{"text":"Their happy hour appetizer special is great. $3 until 4-7pm weekdays. I recommend the Mediterranean Slouvaki. Flavorful and refreshing. You also won't feel like a glutton for ordering a main entree. The Jerk Chicken is really spicey. Spicier than I like and expected but good. I really like their Grouper Picatta. Cooked and flavored just right. Service upon entering is great and so is the wait staff. A little slow though. Watch out for the loud and obnoxious young professional happy hour hoppers. They're the reason why you can't hear. They're literally sitting/standing next to each other but their talking so loud as if they're in a football stadium."}
{"text":"Very good food and cozy atmosphere. Of course if you go on a weekend late night it's not going to be as quaint but in the winter the fireplace is nice or patio is nice in the summer. I usually get the salad with shrimp. The way they prepare their shrimp is very good here. They have live music sometimes on the weekends. One weekend I visited and they had a blues/jazz band that was very good. Service has always been excellent as well."}
{"text":"Ugh it pains me to write this because I dislike slamming any establishment. Went there for dinner last night with my wife and daughter. The place was not crowded. Wife ordered a Sheppard's pie which she said was awesome. My daughter and I ordered wings. According to the menu they call the wings crispy. I actually ordered my wings cooked a little extra crispy to ensure they are actually cooked. We ordered our drinks and when the waiter reurned ordered the food. I was thinking we went invisible because we both needed another drink and had been a good 20 minutes since we had seen our waiter and hadn't received our food. Shortly afterwards our waiter reappeared and explained that our order had been delivered to the wrong table and they had to throw it out. Could we please tell him what we wanted again because he didn't.know what we ordered??? Our waiter had to have been new at what he was doing you can tell he was out of his league. We ordered our 2nd round of drinks. (not for nothing nether of the draft beers I ordered head a head on them) my wife finished her drink I nursed mine and we were no there going on 40 plus minutes with no food. I called the hostess over and asked if I could speak with the manager. To his credit he was of course apologetic and stated he would take care of us. My only critique I could give is he could have been proactive with the situation and not had me have to ask for him. Waiter should have realized that he had messed up and offered something while we were waiting. Food arrived with the exception of the sauted vegetable. My wife liked her pie. My daughter liked her order of plain wings. My wings were split between a \"tossed\" mango habernero and a peach BBQ. The wings definitely were not tossed. It was like someone drizzled a little sauce on the plate. The wings also were far from crispy and I would say the skin was chewy and barely cooked (barely meaning it was edible). I didn't want to create a scene or piss the cook off by sending the wings back. I should also mention I had to ask for my sauted spinach. I actually didn't finish the wings and showed my waiter what my issue was with the uncrispy wings and how as a waiter he needed to watch out for his customers because his livelihood depended on the customer experience. I asked for the check. The manager apparently hadn't communicated to our waiter. I had to wait for the waiter once again. I gave him the check and they comped me for 1/2 of the food. I gave the waiter more than 20% tip on the bill and walked out. I am surprised the manager never reappeared to check on us and the inexperienced waiter is on him. We saw more than 3 other tables come in and be served and finished prior to us even receiving our food. I will be back (not for a while) and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times and recently stumbled upon their Sunday brunch. Food and portions were excellent. Service was very friendly and on point and even came back around as noon approached to see if we wanted anything alcoholic once they could serve it. Have been in for dinner a few times and the fish and chips is a favorite of my boyfriend. Good beer selections and everything we've had on the menu is wonderful. Prices are very reasonable. If you are in the area it is worth a stop if you like Irish food!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars. A restaurant has to be way over the top.  The food here is always prepared very well. Been there numerous times and tried many things. The Irish Club is huge and loaded with Corned Beef-bacon-lettuce- tomato-cheese- to big for one person. The fish n chips are good as well as the Irish egg rolls. The appetizer of chicken tenders is big enough for a main course. The service has been beyond excellent. They always are on top of things and make sure all is well."}
{"text":"Rising up in the middle of Kenton Place, facing a row of buildings that include everything from an ice cream stand, a dance studio, printing company and a Japanese restaurant stands....an Irish pub? And an authentic one at that? Indeed.  Built piece by piece in Dublin by the aptly-named Irish Pub Company, the Galway Hooker was dismantled and reassembled in its current location, where it opened in 2002.  It sports a wrap-around outdoor patio, a large wooden bar, hardwood floors, a stone fireplace, and enough authentic Irish decor to make you wonder why everyone doesn't have a lilting Irish accent.  There's even a miniature door behind one of the tables in the seating area, for leprechauns I presume. Don't bother trying to open it. I already tried...it's locked.   My friends and I have been to the Hooker (its just much fun to say) on many occasions...for dates, St. Patrick's Day, to visit the Comedy Zone-Lake Norman upstairs, and sometimes for no reason other than they serve beer and girls go there!  The menu offers largely American fare, with a small Irish section for those wanting the full-on Irish experience.   Appetizers run in the $8-10 range, while most entrees run $13-15. My recommendation lies with the Kobe beef burgers...excellent!  What really singles out the Hooker (again, fun to say), aside from its authentic Irish construction, is its nightlife.  Live music is offered nightly, and the crowd is almost always up for a good time.  My acoustic band played there recently, and we were surprised when a group of girls started dancing on a table and asked us to announce that all girls should take off their underwear and throw them into a pot.  The pot in question was located on a ledge, which was attached to a main wooden column rising out of the floor in the middle of the restaurant.   I never did see any underwear flying through the air, but I was also busy trying to remember chords and words and figure out who was going to get me another beer.  So what did we learn?  That the Irish, by name or by birth, know how to feed you, water you and throw a good party.  The only drawback is the lack of indoor space on really crowded evenings. The outdoor patio solves some of this during warmer months however.  Being partially Irish myself perhaps I am genetically predisposed towards being biased, but I recommend the Hooker to anyone looking for a nice meal and/or entertaining evening."}
{"text":"Great Irish Fare  One of my favorites.  From the Shepard's Pie to the Fish 'n Chips, great food in a warm atmosphere.  My wife and I were early on patrons when the first opened a number of years ago and unlike a lot of restaurants, it has not diminished of over time but only gotten better.  They have a tried and true menu but they do add new things but that said, nothing is added that has not been tested and approved by the patrons.  Nice decor with a lot of Ireland incorporated.  Service is always good.  Good Food, Great Service, Excellent Atmosphere and all at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for our first time this evening. We ordered the fish & chips and fish tacos.  The fish & chips came quickly but then we waited for nearly ten minutes before the fish tacos arrived, and then after prompting a waitress.  The fish and chips were a bit too greasy for me with a higher ratio of batter to fish than I'm used to.  The fish tacos lacked flavor. Cole slaw side was very good.  We're in no hurry to return other than for some drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Great food & good service. We've tried the fish & chips, fish tacos, meatloaf, another fish dish, chicken pita, salad & shepherds pie. The food is delish."}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere! We sat beneath the trees terrace, enjoying the music and sharing the Irish egg rolls. The food came, hot and tasty. My bride had the salmon panini while I enjoyed the featured burger. Great day and the waitress recommended we come back after 10 PM to enjoy the band."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. I have never had a  bad meal here. Great salads, sandwiches and good selection of beer on tap. Nice atmosphere, we love the patio when the weather is nice outside. The fireplace in the winter."}
{"text":"Great crowd on Saturday nights. They had a live band last time I visited about a month ago. My boyfriend and I were lucky to have found seats by the bar considering how busy it was. Our drink orders were quick and the bartenders were friendly. They have a lovely patio which brings everything together. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Good place for drinks, food has much to be desired. The shepards pie was not something an Irish pub should be proud to serve. While the mashed potatoes on top were good, there was barely any vegetables in the middle and there was a soup like substance in the bottom of the bowl. Far too greasy."}
{"text":"Disappointed with dinner last night. I ordered corned beef and cabbage, my wife ordered meat loaf. When I go to an Irish Pub, I expect real corned beef, not thin sliced deli meat. Meatloaf was flavorless and topped with burnt bacon. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Finally... A place that made a burger as I ordered it. When I ask for medium rare I want medium rare...not medium, certainly not well and definitely not well done. Every place gets it wrong but when I visited this place last week I got the perfect amount of red in the meat.  I definitely recommend the Hooker's Famous Burger that I ordered: handformed angus beef, crisp bacon, local cheddar cheese, overeasy fried egg, herb mayo, barbecue sauce, lettuce, tomato and crispy onion strings. Pretty freaking stellar.  Throw in a friendly waitress that gave me a few local NC beers and I was content for the evening.   Apparently, they have a comedy show on Tuesday nights that takes place upstairs in a special banquet room."}
{"text":"One of the most unique restaurants in the area. The building was shipped piece by piece from Ireland and you really feel you're in Ireland when you dine there (there's even a snug behind the bar). The patio is gorgeous and ivy covered and they have live music out there as well. The fish and chips are by far the best I've had in the south and the wait staff has always been friendly and attentive to us. We have moved out to Stanly County now and still take the hour long drive to go to the Hooker. That's how good it is."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and, for the most part, good food. My friends and I had an unfortunate experience due to a caterpillar-esque  bug found in our French fries. As someone who has worked in the food service industry, I understand that s**t happens, and could easily shrug this off as an isolated incident. The problem we had is that after sharing our find with our server he sort of just laughed it off and didn't take the item off our bill.   This was probably due to a lack of experience, but heads up to Galway Hookers' owners, and anyone else in the food service industry in general: if a customer finds a bug in their food, you need to take it off the bill."}
{"text":"Yummy food.  Good prices.  Nice atmosphere.  I've had the Irish Onion Soup, which was tasty, though I wish it was a little more brothy... and a cheesy pasta and shrimp meal, which also was tasty, but could use more tomatoes.  The prices can't be beat!  I bought three friends a pint yesterday and paid $7 for all three!  The staff is great!  There is lots of parking!  Best of all, the Comedy Zone is upstairs!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place! Fish n chips, fish tacos and their Turkey burger were all superb and literally all the best I've ever had! The inside has a great pub feel, a really nice bar with a good beer selection on tap and drink specials every night of the week. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes and hopefully attend a comedy show."}
{"text":"Above all the measure of a great restaurant is great service and we were certainly not disappointed here!  The staff at the Galway Hooker are simply amazing, courteous and prompt.  To top off the fab service, the food was just awesome!  I opted for the Jameson braized beef medalions which were just oh so tender and delicious.  We will certainly make a return visit the next time we are down around the lake....."}
{"text":"Was hoping for Shepard's Pie with lamb from an \"Irish\" pub.  Since I had my sights on Shepard's pie I decided to try it.  It was OK for beef stew covered with mashed potatoes.  Fairly bland.  The garlic roasted spinach was in a \"soup\".  It had flavor but had to wait a second or two once I got it on the fork in order not to drip.  It was a beautiful night so I sat outside. The patio is very nice.  I did not see the interior besides the reception desk."}
{"text":"I met with a friend here. The environment and service were good.  I really enjoyed the Nachos."}
{"text":"The second best Irish Pub in America hands down. Super service, actually the best I had in a Pub anywhere.  Had the Bacon Blue Burger, top notch, cooked perfectly.  Just visiting the area but if I lived here this would be my new hangout!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night (a Tuesday) for dinner and were both sick afterward, for hours.  My poor boyfriend was in the bathroom intermittently the entire night and didn't sleep.  I was lucky and only got moderately nauseous for an hour or so.  He had the shepherd's pie and cabbage (of which I only had a couple bites) and I had the reuben and fries (of which he only had a couple bites), so I think it's safe to say that the culprit of our late night bathroom adventures was the shepherd's pie and/or cabbage.  Maybe my advice would be to come here on a night that's typically busier to ensure fresh food, if you dare?  I'd been here a couple of times in the past few years for St. Patty's Day, which was always great!  Never sick before (even considering the fact that there was a lot more beer at those times) and was really looking forward to some good comfort food yesterday.  Based on all the other reviews, I think they must get it right most of the time, but I don't think I'll be coming back here again after last night."}
{"text":"Great, yummy food and drinks. Reasonably priced and excellent service. We definitely plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Very cool place if your in the mood for Irish fare. Tradition pub atmosphere with a nice selection of brews. I started with the calamari, (not Irish I know) which was excellent. Service was above par. Even though it was me first time there, the staff made me feel like a regular. They have a nice outdoor seating area. And even a comedy club upstairs, who knew?"}
{"text":"Went for St Patricks Day......  Place was sooo unprepared. Service was awful, never even got my complete meal...fish n chips. Yep, only got fish. Waitress was so overwhelmed, like she had never been in the food service business before in her life. Took for ever to get a drink. They really need to start preparing for St Pats 2017.....TOMORROW."}
{"text":"Great lean corned beef Reuben and delicious chicken and waffles, great place for Sunday brunch, with a mimosa. Manager Angelo is cool and very attentive and provides great customer service."}
{"text":"Pub yes, Irish no. I didn't come into an \"Irish pub\" to listen to Ariana Grande on the radio and then some white guy trying to sound like Bob Marley (and failing miserably). As a person of Irish heritage, this was like a Latino person walking into a \"Mexican restaurant\" staffed entirely by white people, playing Sitar music, and being offered \"Mexican sushi\" and \"South of the Border Souvlaki.\""}
{"text":"The Galway Hooker is very authentic and gives the feeling of actually being in Ireland or England (forgive me).  The fish and chips are great. The homemade chips (french fries) are very good, and the nacho supreme or whatever they call them are really good. When family anf friends from London visit, they want to go there for the nachos. Hard to find any that are good in London.  Prices of draft beer are a bit steep except for the cheap Stella on Mondays (I believe). Overall a very good place and you will be well attended to."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars but i can't. Literally the WORST service I've ever received for mediocre food. Went there with a group of friends (14 of us with reservations) and were there for 3 HOURS for a meal. Took almost an hour for the waitress to take our order (the person she was training eventually took it, and then she had to retake it). One entire hour later (2 hours after arrival) we got our food, at least part of it, most of the entrees were missing sides. We were told initially that the kitchen was backed up and then there was no follow up (the place was at least half empty). Every time my water was empty it took 15-30 min to refill it (with 2 waitresses for our table). After we finally received our food I spoke to the hostess to speak to the manager about our 2 hour service time and NO ONE EVER CAME OVER (even though I saw her speak to who I assume a manager was while looking at our group). The worst service we have ever received all around.  Even though we live close by we will never be back."}
{"text":"This is NOT your typical bar fare. This truly has Irish roots. Shepherd's Pie that's big and rich and hearty. Enough to fill up and satisfy my weight lifting hubby. The burgers are kickin and I tried my son's tenders and they were pretty good. They try to use only locally sourced products. Good beer selection and they can make a real shandy w/out being told how. Solid service. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came from out of town.  Decor was great, atmosphere was great.  We started with an appetizer, Mediterranean chicken skewers.  Bland, plain chicken, was not marinated and the tzatziki was very watery.  Not impressed at all.  Did not order any other food.  Bartender was too busy chatting to give any real customer service.  I bought a beer for the entertainer and she told me she couldn't take it to him, why couldn't I?  If she was too busy, she wasn't, she should have asked a waitress to do it and not question me.  She needs some customer service training.  Other waitresses were too busy socializing and dancing to pay us any attention at our table.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands-down one of the best food and atmosphere experiences near CLT.  The decor was actually shipped over from Ireland.  Awesome tempura asparagus and bread pudding. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time with our family.  Service was very quick and good.  We enjoyed our meal and authentic Irish atmosphere.  It's a little loud but again it's a pub/restaurant."}
{"text":"Great for Happy Hour half priced apps until 6p. Love the garlic shrimp Monday- Thursday. Good selection of beer on drafts. Patio is nice to sit out in the warmer months."}
{"text":"This is a fun place that you go to have a good time and then eat if you are hungry. Food is pretty good if you are into irish pub fare, but I just usually go to enjoy the bar or comedy club and then enjoy a shepherd's pie or jalapeno macaroni and cheese while I am there."}
{"text":"Decor was great, service was okay, food was just okay. The fish and chips were just ok, surprising for a place like this. Salmon sandwich was better. The table we sat at had a couch on one side that was uncomfortable and made it difficult to sit up at the table. Don't know that we would come back."}
{"text":"I don't come here nearly as often as I want to.  I always enjoy the atmosphere, the food, and the drinks and usually end up drinking or eating too much. I think the food and drink prices are more than fair and are on par with the overall quality.  I think the place stays true to it's Irish roots by offering some Irish inspired dishes and offering darker, heavier beers as well as everyone's domestic go-to.  Also, the whiskey selection is something to appreciate.  Also, I am often impressed at how the waitresses and hosts can keep up with the scrambled mess the place becomes once the bar area fills up, but the service is always great.    Upstairs is the Comedy Zone where you can see comedians as their on their way to the D list, but its still a great experience."}
{"text":"I'd call this place a Birkdale \"gem\" since it is located away from the main drag in Birkdale but is definitely worth it to go out of your way to find this place.  It had been bookmarked (\"on my list\") for a while now and I finally got to experience the excellence of this place.    Went with a buddy on a Tuesday evening.  There was a decent size crowd watching some sports from the bar or from the tables.  They had a roaring fireplace..... which upon further inspection was a gas fireplace (doh!)... but it provided some great ambiance and character to an already cozy and inviting, upscale Irish pub.  For some reason, whenever I got to a place that deems itself and \"Irish Pub\" I always find the urge to order traditional Irish fare and see how the food stacks up.  On this particular night I ordered their fish and chips - which was highlighted on the menu as one of their specialties.....  I was expecting a lot from it since I have eaten my fair share of fish and chips.  My expectations were met and exceeded!  The fish was perfectly cooked... the breading was light and the fries that accompanied the fish were perfect.  A lot of places have a heavy hand with the breading or the fries are way too crispy or way too soggy.  This was a perfect combo of fish 'n' chip goodness.    Definitely need to come back to try more on their menu - especially the BEER!  I must confess, it was a work-night and I live very far away from Galway so I will probably never get to be a beer expert here, unless the restaurant lets me crash next to the nice fireplace (which I highly doubt).  Typical bar offerings here... I bet this place is hopping when the weather is nice judging by the number of outdoor seating areas around the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had live music and good beer prices. It' s not that big inside so can get packed quick with little amount of people. All in all its a cool bar to go and hang out on a friday night"}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to give this place one star and here's why: the noise. By far, this is the loudest, noisiest establishment that I've been to including all those bars back in my 20's. You cannot have a conversation or hear the waiter. The acoustics are horrible and it completely ruined my dining experience. I ordered the shrimp and mashed potatoes and onion rings. Surprisingly, the food was actually really good. The ambiance is more bar with drinkers than restaurant with diners. Don't bring children here. Don't bring a date, too loud and obnoxious. Lastly, you need to park around back and cut through the alley to the front and it is pitch black, not lit at all which was not cool. I was really disappointed because the menu had a lot of tasty entrees and apps but the noise was completely unbearable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for a bit after a football game. We were hungry and dove right into a pretzel app with tasty dipping sauces, and 2 Blue Moons on tap, per drink special. My man loves fish n chips and these were excellent, light and flaky, and I had the bangers n mash, with beer battered asparagus. Creative, and tasty! Also the ambience was great, very authentic to a U.K. or Irish pub. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times and service is hit or miss. Outdoor space is beautiful but it took five minutes for us to be seated (there were seats available) and an additional fifteen minutes before a waitress came over. She said something like \"I think you've been waiting. I was just told you were here but I asked if anyone wanted to take your table and they didn't so here I am\". She took our food and drink orders. It took another ten minutes before our bottle of wine was delivered.   One of the items I ordered was the Mac n cheese, without scallions. It arrived with scallions but given the slow pace of the service, I decided to just eat around them. My husband had the fish and chips and really enjoyed it. From the time we finished eating to when the bill was delivered was another fifteen minutes. Server kept saying she would bring a bag for the bottle of wine (we didn't finish it) and after waiting five minutes for her to bring my card back, without the wine bag, I decided to just take the bottle as is.   On a previous visit, my husband ordered the Salmon but it was raw in the center. It ruined his appetite and sent it back to be taken off of the bill. A manager came out to inquire why it was sent back, when he mentioned the fish was raw, he said he would have to go check. The server apologized profusely when she saw it, never saw the manager again.   A lot of potential but speed of service really needs to improve."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I've never had a bad time. Food is always amazing and the servers are great. Some nights it can be pretty crowded but that's just a sign of how good it is. They have a great outdoor area and upstairs there is a private area for parties and the comedy zone shows on Tuesdays. Plenty of parking behind the restaurant too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food!  The menu options were extensive, including authentic Irish to American favorites. No one at our table was disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pub for the Huntersville area.  We used to live nearby and frequented the pub and recently visited for my fathers birthday.  He too makes regular stops here a couple times per month for great beers and great prices.  My wife and I have difficulty eating out since we started eating 'Paleo' but their salads and meat options for them are fantastic.  They loved the apps and fish and chips as well!  If you are in the area, this is one of the few great stops within miles.  If you don't want to brave the crowd of Birkdale Village, drive a bit further and enjoy a pint at Galway."}
{"text":"Great menu options with an Irish twist. Not a tone of sit down table space, but they have a decent bar area and some other bar like tables. Serves was slightly on the slow side but the atmosphere was great so we didn't mind the wait."}
{"text":"I came here for a wine and canvas event and was pleasantly surprised when I approached a charming building that looks like it belongs in the Dublin and not Cornelius. It was happy hour when I arrived and they have some great specials. I tried a Black Velvet which is a twist on a black and tan. It is Gunniess draft poured on top of hard cider. It was the most delightful drink! I also had the corned beef and cabbage egg rolls. They come with a vinegar dipping sauce and mustard and they may be my new favorite snack! Absolutely delightful. I also had the fried buffalo wings. They were hot and crispy and just amazing. My friends enjoyed their dishes as well, traditional corned beef and cabbage and bangers and mash.  An added bonus is the patio. At night, it is so romantic, as it is covered by trees and café lights. The event space is up a flight of charmingly painted stairs and makes a great venue for a wedding or party.  I was thrilled with the drinks, food, and atmosphere and would definitely be back again to show my husband what it is all about."}
{"text":"A great friendly , great food restaurant.  Great food, great service, reasonable prices and warm friendly atmosphere. We go there once a week. Their fish and chips is fantastic and the rest of the menu items are real tasty. The patio is a great place to sit weather providing."}
{"text":"Found myself venturing north of Charlotte last night and enjoyed a fun evening at a really nice Irish pub.   We were looking for something a bit low-key given the following night will be full of Halloween parties.  Fun night, good company.  I had the meatloaf, she had the jerk chicken.  Sampling both we agreed the meatloaf (topped with Tabasco and mushrooms) was just slightly better, but both get 5 stars!   Atmosphere and feel were very authentic.   We ended up staying longer then originally anticipated, if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"Best Irish Pub hands down.  We are there at least twice a week.  Service is excellent and food is great.  Ask for Hannah. She's the reason we keep coming back."}
{"text":"We love this place. Always good food, service and environment. Affordable with great beer specials. Great for kids or happy hour. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here last Friday with my boyfriend, and we loved it! Arrived about 8pm and had to wait for a table for about 20 minutes but we went to the bar and grabbed a beer.  When they sat us shortly after I think we got the best seat in the house right near the fire place.  Atmosphere was perfect! We had a great dinner, he got Meatloaf and I have a chicken sandwich - very fairly priced as well.  Definitely will be returning sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe!  The music is awesome (although a bit loud for easy conversation), the tables are spaced well apart, and there is a nice fire going in the winter.  We started with the wings (buffalo style), and they were very good.  I had the fish and chips, and was really glad I substituted jalapeño macaroni and cheese for the chips.  It was the best mac 'n cheese I have ever had - awesomely spicy!  The fried grouper (no cod here) was huge and delicious.  My husband's jerk chicken was not our favorite, as the sauce was too sweet.  That won't keep us from coming back, however.  This one is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Irish Pub with great fare and better atmosphere. I have been there multiple times but usually get the Bangers and Mash. Their Mac N Cheese is also really good! The beer selection is good but could benefit from better specials and more traditional Irish selections."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the Galway Hooker. The decor makes for an excellent dining experience. I just loved the atmosphere of the place. We want to eat outside next time. The service was adequate. The food was flavorful, but my dish wasn't as hot as I would have liked. Got the bangers and mash with the cabbage. These are descent bangers. My friend got the sweet potato fries that comes with a marshmallow dipping sauce. They were ridiculously good, as was the bread pudding for dessert. We are both eager to return and sample more of the tempting items on the menu."}
{"text":"Me and some friends on a girls night out went here for dinner and drinks and were not dissapointed! The Food was amazing! I got the irish club with jalapeno mac n cheese and it was out of this world! I will definantley go back and it may be today with my family! The atmosphere is great for everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hit or miss for me. I have been in a couple of times and the first time I went in I ordered a salad. The salad was soggy very minimal strawberries and not a whole lot of flavor overall. This is a bar but it does have a general seating area for eating which I would think they do a lot of food orders. My fiancé on the other hand is absolutely obsessed with the fish and chips. Every time we go back that is all he orders. It definitely has a crispy exterior and a moist interior which is very flavorful. You get one piece of cod laying on a bed of french fries which is absolute heaven for my fiancé. I find the issue to be that it's a mixture between nailing the menu items and customer service. The second time we went in our waiter was rude, short with us, And made us feel like it was an inconvenience for him when we ordered things or like he didn't have the time of day for us. I feel like that would make anybody not want to give their money to an establishment. I did really enjoy their crème brûlée. It was delicious and for bar food I think they really nailed the crème brûlée. This place is generally very busy during the weekend and a great place to hang out. Mostly just to grab a beer though I would hold off on food unless it's the fish and chips."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with Galway Hooker this evening. There were four of us going out to dinner, so we called as soon as they opened to make sure we reserved a table. When we arrived there they sat us in the booth in the back of the bar. When I sat down on the bench, my body fell into a huge rut in the seat! It was so deep that I had to roll up my thick leather jacket and sit on it! The manager informed me that he had reported the defect to management several times. I guess management doesn't care about their customers!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been a trooper about eating only seafood for the month, so when he recently said he wanted some good fish and chips, I did a Google search and happened upon this place. We were seated immediately and both ordered fish and chips (my fella added a side of jalapeño mac and cheese to his).   Our food came out quickly and was hot. The fish was awesome. I've been to Ireland and to be honest, I liked the fish and chips at this place better. The fish was crunchy outside and perfect on the inside. There were a ton of fries and I couldn't even really make a dent in them. I tried my fella's jalapeño mac and cheese and we both agreed there wasn't much jalapeño flavor. Still, he liked it and said he would get it again.   Overall, this place is alright by us!"}
{"text":"Good patio with a decent menu. My only complaint is that they are not open for lunch and that their service was unreliable at time, but I will be going again for sure."}
{"text":"My husband got the meatloaf and I got the Ahi tuna. They were both very yummy and came out very fast. The waitress was very attentive and helpful.  The restaurant is cozy and decorated well.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being a St. Patrick's Day baby, what better way to celebrate than with family at The Galway Hooker! My sister, her boyfriend, my nephew and my wife and I all had a great time even though it was uber crowded that day. They had a line you had to pass thru the get carded and a wrist band then it was on to the party! They had several tents set up with live music and bars plus inside a bagpiper was playing tunes. Although it was very busy inside the restaurant, we quickly found a table. Our server, Emily, was on top of her game as busy as it was and kept the alcohol and food comming. I got fish and chips with large, meaty, flakey fish with a light crispy batter that was great covered in malt vinegar. My wife went  for the sheppards pie was good as well. My sister tried the bangers and mash and was disappointed the sausages were not the true blood sausages and sent it back for the fish and chips. With it being St. Pattys Day we had to have some Jameson Irish whisky and Guinness to wash down all that good food. As the Irish say, \" If whisky can't cure it, there's no cure for it\"! I want to thank my sister and family for making the big 5-1 a great time and one Birthday I will remember fondly for a long time."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, one of the best restaurants in Cornelius/Huntersville/Lake Norman!  It's obvious because they are always slammed.  Their food is always cooked to order and exceptionally tasty. We come here at least once/week because we crave about 8 different things on the menu.  The atmosphere makes you feel like your in a pub in Ireland which is just an added bonus."}
{"text":"Love it. Chili is very good and the size great. They have amazing onion rings and the beer samplers are so tasty. So far all we have had is been very fresh and good pub food.  Jay had the bangers and mash and he liked them"}
{"text":"As far as I've found, Galway Hooker is one of the most traditional Irish pubs around in Charlotte. It's located in Cornelius/Huntersville (Lake norman). The atmosphere is very nice, cozy place to spend time with friends.    Bartenders are great. Friendly, fast service. They introduced all the bartenders to us. Great drinks. Huge selections of beers.  Overall: Great pub with good food and good beer in a homey environment. Irish goodness and just a ton of fun overall."}
{"text":"We LOVE the Galway Hooker!  We must eat here every single week - food is delicious, service is amazing. This is our family's go-to place and today we are celebrating Easter here!  The brunch is so great!  Our favorite place to be!"}
{"text":"Love the outdoor area. The service is a little slow but the food makes it all worth it!"}
{"text":"The Hooker is our 'watering hole.' The restaurant is within walking distance to our house. They are now open on Sundays so restaurant diners can enjoy brunch, lunch, dinner, or drinks while watching their favorite NFL team.  Their food is delicious. They always seasonal specials running. Their beer selection is definitely hit or miss, but something for everyone! They even have a shaded outdoor patio that is pet friendly. (We bring our leashed dog there often)."}
{"text":"Always great service and atmosphere.  Great bartenders and staff;  Caitlin is the best.  The Irish egg rolls, buffalo shrimp and meatloaf are to die for.  I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We went for Sunday brunch. I had the filet benedict, which was delicious.  It also came with breakfast potatoes and a bowl of melon. And the price came in less than the breakfast spot I usually go to for \"Toast\". Which I couldn't believe. I'll be back for sure!! Great service and lovely Irish decor."}
{"text":"Fun lil place. So much Irish love!   I was concerned that there would not be any seats (only stools) but there are plenty of seats! Lots of draft beer choices too (I liked White Zombie - a local pick).  The burger is a prime example of southern comfort. To my surprise and delight, it has an egg! The meat is very tender and juicy - the best burger I've had in a long time. :)  I highly recommend this place to locals and travels alike.   PS Don't be afraid to check out the jalapeño Mac and Cheese. It's so yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to going to Galway Hooker ever since I first laid eyes on it. I've never been to a place that served up authentic Irish grub and the concept of stuff like bangers and mash and shepards pie sounded like the stuff dreams are made of. We finally got around to heading out last night, and unfortunately the food was not as great as I expected.  The interior of the place is pretty cool, and I was digging a lot of the decor. There was a decent sized bar as well as some tables where you could grab a beer and some eats. Our server was ever-present and was able to answer some of my simple questions about their beer selection. The service was also very quick, especially for a Saturday night, since our salads came out within minutes of placing our order.  We each ordered a house side salad to start with, and they were far from being the greatest. It consists of some mixed greens with tomato, onion and cucumber. The tomatoes were mealy and the bleu cheese dressing they offer was not bleu cheesy at all.   When we were about half way done with our salads the entrees came out. So yeah, it's quick service, but maybe a tad too quick. I ordered the Shepards Pie ($12) which is a bowl of ground beef, mashed potatoes, peas and carrots, all smothered in a brown gravy. The portion was very generous, making it quite the hearty meal. However, there was something missing in the dish. Now granted, I've never had Shepard's Pie before, so maybe this was how it is supposed to taste. But to me, it was lacking in overall taste. It needed a little something, like some seasoning in the meat or some herbs or seasonings in the gravy. Whatever it was, while it was decent it wasn't anything to write home about.  My wife ordered the shrimp and grits ($12) and was also slightly disappointed in her meal. While the shrimp were cooked to perfection the overall flavor was not great. The grits themselves were some of the butteriest I've ever had, and it made the dish really rich. Like the Shepard's Pie the shrimp and grits are served in a huge bowl, making this a very heavy dish.   The food at the Galway Hooker left a bit to be desired. While nothing was disgusting or awful, the food we had just wasn't all that good. I think that we might have approached Galway Hooker in the wrong way, and maybe should look at it as more a place to grab apps and beer as opposed to a full on sit down dinner. I would return to either grab a drink at the bar or maybe to try a sandwich for lunch, but I don't think I'll be in any rush to give their full menu a whirl again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night for the first time, the food was incredible. The shepherds pie was delicious! Friendly staff & fast service. The drink specials were on point and they also have a pretty decent beer selection. Will definitely be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Good but so packed that we always have to wait at least 20-30 min just to sit down. Food is pretty good. I have gotten the shepherd's pie and meatloaf. Both are pretty good. Beer selection is pretty average for this area. Their st. Patrick's day fest is pretty fun but woah is it crowded. Takes forever on that day to get any service but still a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Service definitely can make or break a meal for me so Kristen made it very enjoyable! From allowing me to sample beer to suggesting options to good conversation, she was great. I tried the shepherds pie and Parmesan broccoli. Broccoli was cooked perfectly...not mushy. Pie was tasty. Creme brûlée for dessert was ok...forgot the fruit and had to put it on after the fact which wasn't the same...it also could've been warm. Otherwise, sat on the patio with my dog and had a nice brunch."}
{"text":"I came here with family while I was visiting them from PA. The outside of the place was very inviting and I was excited to see what kind of restaurant this would be. We were greated warmly and given a table by the fire. It was not crowded at all because it was a Sunday night, they did have the football game on the TV's so it was a little loud for chatting at dinner. I was shocked to see so few actual Irish food options on the menu so this soured me a little. I decided to go for the fish tacos instead. I will admit my expectations for a fish taco were very low. I was wrong it was the best one I have ever had, fresh tasty and amazing. Everyone at our table all commented on how they were expecting average pub fare but were so happy that their food was above and beyond that. The food is worth a trip."}
