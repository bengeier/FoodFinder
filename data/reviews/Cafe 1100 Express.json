{"text":"Where do you find Boar's Head in Cleveland? Right here. It's not a full deli but they've got the fundamentals for a fast good lunch.  The guy who runs the register is a classic counterman. He knows you if you're a regular and spits out the order quick fast and in a hurry. He's never flustered and always courteous and prompt. This is exactly what you want - he's New York fast.  The specialty are the wraps. Me, I get the honey mustard chicken wrap, but the italian is very good to. The quesadillas are extra spicy so beware as is the buffalo chicken wrap.  Good. Fast. Cheap. Hey, you get all three."}
{"text":"Cafe 1100 Express has become a lunch time staple for my office.  They've got great wraps and a good variety at good prices.  The Balsamic Turkey wrap is a popular one around here, and I like the Greek Chicken and the Gyro as well.  I've been getting food here for over a year now and they've been consistently good.  One time they messed up one of our wraps but they offered to remake the wrap right away and gave us a free one for next time.    I'd definitely recommend any of their wraps, and the fries are pretty good too... but don't go for the chili... it's the only thing I've had here that was bad."}
