{"text":"This is sort of an upscale Thai Express serving Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian and Thai dishes. The Food is very fresh and very flavourful.  My Pho soup had a rich broth, the meat in the Pad Sew could not have been more tender and my wife's shrimp and crispy noodles was light and fresh with a beautifully seasoned sauce. The dining room is simple and calm. Portions could be larger - my wife and I had 3 mains plus imperial rolls between us. There are 11 mains on the menu.  It is fairly reasonably priced and service is pleasant."}
{"text":"Have driven by so many times - last week saw the restaurant was full and decided to finally try it out.  So glad we did!  The owners/staff are very gracious and accommodating.   The won ton soup was flavourful - I believe some lemongrass flavouring.  Our combo meal was great - general Tao, beef & broccoli and chicken pad Thai - all fantastic, flavourful and fresh.  The portions could be a touch larger but the quality is top notch.  We found a great restaurant close to home!"}
{"text":"Excellent family-owned restaurant, very friendly staff and fast service. 
The food is authentic and and puts Thai Express to shame. Meals come out steaming hot with fresh ingredients, and not to mention the great prices. I recommend the Pad Thai and the Beef Broccoli. I will be returning and bringing my friends. Definitely worth it."}
