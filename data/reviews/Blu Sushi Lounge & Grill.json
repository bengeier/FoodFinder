{"text":"Waited over hour for food.  Only one person making sushi.  Left without food, they still charged for the one beer we had.  Bad server + no food = horrible exp."}
{"text":"After amazing sushi we met the owner/sushi chef Richard, best I've had in Arizona!  Looking forward to Blu opening in North Scottsdale....best wishes to your new venture!"}
{"text":"Finally found a good sushi spot in Arizona! I had the Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, they were both very fresh. I also had a sashimi salad and a roll. All the fish was fresh, and the restaurant was very clean. By far the freshest fish I have found since moving to Arizona!"}
{"text":"went on a Friday night at 8 pm. not a single table was bussed, there were dirty plates everywhere. the food was ok, prolly some of the worst sushi i have had...but still ok. Some of the cuts of fish tasted pretty fishy. I was pretty disappointed. I would suggest going somewhere else in Goodyear like tomo or nakama or ah so."}
{"text":"Love the squid salad. The best!  We order also 12 piece sashimi and sear ahi tuna roll. Service was fast and the food was good. We wiil come back."}
{"text":"There may be new owners but they still retain their most excellent chef. 

- Don't be a puss and ask the chef for his recommendations.
- You must try the lemon roll, volcano roll and sashimi salad."}
{"text":"Absolutley our favorite sushi place! We lived in old Litchfield for 12 years and would drive the golf cart down for lunch or dinner at least 2 or 3 times a week. Since then we moved, but still come here as much as possible. Richard the owner is amazing!! He makes the most beautiful  dishes and is so much fun to hang out with! If you havent tried this place yet, you must go!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but cold and overpriced.  Service was slow and unfriendly.  Probably a great menu, but needs to improve service.  We were not seated, not found for close to 10 minutes, took another 10 minutes to get our drinks (which were not refilled again), and 2 hours later we left angry along with most others in the restaurant.  Needs a lot of work!! Avoid this place in the mean time."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant for my oldest daughter's 25th birthday.  She loves sushi and had been wanting to try Blu Sushi for sometime.  The food was wonderful. We had ordered several different rolls and it was presented in a beautiful wooden boat.  The staff was very nice and helpful in explaining the menu. The drinks were really yummy too. We got there before happy hour ended and we were able to enjoy some very nice happy hour prices."}
{"text":"My husband and came here on a recommendation by one of his friends. We tend to be a little picky about fresh sushi, with me being from SF and him having visited Japan several times. I was a little skeptical of this place at first because it looked like it could have doubled as a night club with its revolving colored lights on the ceiling (they were off) and full bar.  I wouldn't exactly call this place a cozy place but the fish was very fresh and the sushi was neatly rolled. (I hate it when it comes out all falling apart or when the rice is smashed together!) LOVED the yellowtail nigiri. It had this green onion topping that made it extra-special. It is a littlemore pricey than conventional sushi places($6.50 for the 2 pieces of Nigiri), but well worth it for freshness. Overall, I was pretty impressed of this place in Litchfield."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I had been to Blu.  My last visit was less than anticipated and frankly I was disappointed.   However...last night I decided to give it another shot...and I am glad I did!  The waitress made awesome suggestions and Richard...the original owner / chef  took the time to talk with us.  Our food was fresh and delicious.  We will definetly be back!."}
{"text":"We have been here when old ownership was running the place and it was good but now with new ownership as of October 2012  Shinhe \"Jiney\" it's even better! She is awesome and always walks around asking the customers if everything is ok. Also the sushi chef she brought in \"Richard\" prepares some delicious rolls the food is amazing. The service is great as well Nick and Denise are very good! We HIGHLY recommend this place! We are Litchfield Park residents for over 10 years and It is our intention to support our local business owners such as Shinhe so we will be seeing her at Blu every weekend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend went here 2 weeks ago with his daughter for a quick bite around 5pm. The place only had 3 tables of customers. An hour later he still didn't have any food.  He was upset with the wait and asked several times where his food was. I was surprised when he said  he wanted to go again but he wanted to give them another chance.  It New Years Eve and the place was busy. We were given 2 seating choices then asked to move 5 minutes later for a reservation. They were seated and left within 5 minutes.  At that point, after we ordered drinks the waitress told us they were only serving sushi, no hot food because they only had one cook. He told the waitress his concern about the long wait the last time when there were only 4 tables .... She said it was going to be a long wait again if not longer.   So since we had already ordered a tea and a Saporro beer ... We decided to stay for that only.  Oh and my hot tea was luke warm at best. We decided to go to Akai Hana on Pebble Creek Pkwy where the service and food are outstanding!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Good food and good prices. Richard is a cool guy. This isn't the type of place where they sell cheap sushi. Sushi is simple you get what you pay for. Richards prices in my opinion are fair especially for now delicious it is."}
{"text":"We took a chance and tried something new.  I would consider myself a sushi snob.  Our first order was their Vegas explosion (or something along that line) roll.  It was ok.  Vegas rolls are normally crispy and their roll had a spongy texture...however, It was a nice add on to put shredded imitation crab on top.

We also had the Fire roll, which was reccommended by the waiter.  I was surprised this was priced about $14 and so popular.  Ok, so they put a little flame on it...  The sushi was soggy and didn't impress us.  They drown it in too much sauce.  Simple is better in some cases.  We also had the Lemon roll.  That was not as Lemon flavor as you would expect.  The appetizers were ok.  Nothing to write about.  I was not impressed with this sushi spot.  

On the positive side, Their Leche Martini was delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!  My wife and I were ready for a nice evening out together and decided to try something new in the Litchfield Park area and decided on Blu Sushi.  We went inside and waited at the front entrance for 5 minutes.  We were never greeted or taken to a table and didn't see a sign saying that we should seat ourselves.  I can't say this enough, horrible service!  Blu Sushi ruined the spirit of what started out to be an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here all of the time!! Im very picky with my sushi and this place hits the nail on the head every time! Richard and Sam are the best! Walking into this place is like walking into a close friends house. Everyone greets you and makes you always feel welcome. Richard will create you any type of roll you want and even my husband who never was a fan of sushi, got hooked on this place! Cant say enough wonderful things about Blu Sushi and the staff and we cant wait to go back in!! So fun all the time!!!"}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here. The guy serving us was great and made some delicious recommendations (green tea tempura!!). We had arrived at about 8:10 (they close at 9 during weekdays), so we ended up being there a little bit past 9. I was surprised by how nice they were about it as it was our friends birthday. Literally all of the employees told us to have a great night and was super nice. I found the food to be pretty tasty and overall liked the place a lot :)"}
{"text":"We will not be going back to Blu. I've said this before, but we always seem to get invited by different people, and we've given in. But this time, it's official, as I promised to write a review on behalf of 7 other people that were a part of our group on Friday night. There's no one left who would want to go back there amongst our group of friends. Our experience was so bad, it was surreal. Just some of the highlights:

It should say something, when before even going in, when the other restaurant's on the same strip are on a wait and packed, and there are 3 guests in Blu at 6:30 on a Friday night. We committed to meeting a large party, though, so it worked for us, on this occasion.

We went in, and our party got there at staggered times, couple by couple, which should have made it easy to keep things separate.  After 4 of us were there (2 couples), the server came up to us, and made a big deal about having separate checks. Keep in mind that there were a total of 7 guests in the whole restaurant at this point. She kept pointing out on the menu that their policy is that they won't do it. We didn't argue or really make much of a comment, but she kept repeating it to us. She finally said that they would do it, but with major protest to herself.

At 7:00, a sushi chef came around, turned on a disco ball, and cranked the music so loudly (still, less than 10 guests in the whole place), it was difficult to hear each other across the table.  The 2 sushi chefs would frequently yell out (think hibachi) and partake in sake shots. During our 2 hours there, we saw one of the chefs (who referred to himself as Charlie) take at least 7 shots, growing louder and more obnoxious with each one. 

At one point, Charlie came over to our table started dancing ON one of the women with us, and asked who wanted to arm-wrestle.  One of our visiting guests, jokingly took him up on it, and ended up with Charlie taking him down on the floor, fully wrestling him, arm around his neck and (I'm not exaggerating) touching him inappropriately. Seriously.

This is not even a reflection of the food...yet.  4 of the 8 of us ordered cooked rolls, which we have had in the past. Normally they take some time to get, but come out piping hot. This time, they were unrecognizable, and COLD. We actually asked the chef about it, and he went on a rant, about he doesn't make it the same way that they last chef did, and that his way was better. He actually said that the last chef was an a**hole, before he took the cold rolls away. 

When we were (oh so) ready to leave, we asked for our check(s). You could immediately tell this was stressful for our server, who disappeared for a solid 10 minutes, re-appeared to tell us she needed a break from our checks, and that she would be in the bathroom (necessary??), and returned another 10 minutes later. 

The total experience was bad enough, but finding out that the pricing had increased at least 20-30% with the new management, put the nail in the coffin. $11 dollars for a goose and soda? I would expect this pricing in Scottsdale or at a hotel, but in Litchfield Park, not at all. 

We will not be going back...don't even think about giving it a try. We have...multiple times. Service is always an issue, but this was above and beyond! There are much better sushi options in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"So far it's been 1.5 hours and the sushi still has not arrived. I ordered chicken bulgogi and they bring out beef without telling me they ran out of chicken and would only comp 10% on food I didn't want.  It is very loud and drunk people screaming and cursing while kids sit near causing people to leave.  The table next to us has been waiting even longer then us and they are still waiting.  I do not recommend this place as far as service goes.  I couldn't tell you the quality of the food because it never made it out."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. Service was horrible it was slow and we got our food almost 40 minutes to an hour later and we were there for 2 hours. Food was mediocre and on top of that a couple came in after us and they got their food before us and we waiting 20 minutes after they God their food"}
{"text":"Basic sushi...very small portion...and on the higher end in terms of what you pay. Definatly will not be returning...for just mediocre."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and flavorful. Quick and respectful service. The environment and staff are great, especially the lounge area. I recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Myself and two friends came here on Friday night around 8:00 pm, were seated immediately then waited over an hour and a half after to receive our food. After being asked why our order was taking so long, our server replied \"ya, I'd be mad too.\" Honestly enjoyed the atmosphere and the sushi and tempura was on point when it finally made it to our table. Unfortunate the service doesn't reflect the cuisine."}
{"text":"Fabulous!! We sat in the sofa area and the atmosphere, food, waitress was just what we were looking for. We ordered roll after roll and they just kept them coming."}
{"text":"God awful! Came here after making a reservation for ten people and everyone got there food at different times and about 45 minutes in between. Food is disappointing and just terrible. Do not recommend what so ever. Understaffed, inexperienced, and plain out disappointing."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  After many meals and dollars, arrived at 8:45 and were told, \"Sorry.  We close at 9 PM.\"  Terrible way to take care of local, supportive customers. Shame on you, Blu."}
{"text":"Sushi is very good, people are very nice, but the litchfield park roll is the one to get."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Owner is friendly.  Different items to choose from with an extensive menu. Great specialty drinks. Happy hour pricing can't be beat with the quality."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour one day on a wim. I like the decor and feel of the place. Prices were great and sushi was delicious I will definitley be back."}
{"text":"If you want authentic sushi at a reasonable price, venture elsewhere.

My boyfriend and I love sushi and we try new places all the time (6 so far in the Phoenix area) and decided to give this one a shot since it was closer to our homes in the West Valley. The inside atmosphere was nice; spacious architecture, a very friendly waitress.

The menu, however, was disappointingly short. We decided to order something simple first, and then another roll if we were satisfied. We ordered a simple spicy tuna roll, a basic roll that's pretty difficult to mess up. The tuna wasn't fresh, and the for the price we paid (I can't recall now, but we knew we could get more for our money at other places), we received a pretty stingy serving. 

For the deliberate mention of their chef to emphasize the sushi's authenticity, we expected much better. Even those small, generic \"Ichi Ban\" outperform Blu Sushi."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi snob, and this place is good for AZ.  I only had sashimi (albacore and tuna) and nigiri (yellowtail and Spanish mackerel) so I can't vouch for their rolls, but it was excellent.  Service was good also.  Nice cold sake selection as well. Everyone sitting at the sushi bar and got a complimentary tempura dish, which I declined but appreciated.  Sushi chef/owner is very friendly and seems dedicated to quality, which is huge when you're eating raw fish.  I would give 5 stars, but that is reserved for the \"Nobu quality\" sushi bars that are difficult to find in the desert.  All said, highly recommend Blu Sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi and interesting specials. The owner came by to talk to us and offered us a discount when we said we were teachers! Our favorite place to sit is in the \"private\" dining room."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least. It took over an hour to get our food. Several of the drinks that we ordered did not taste right. The dirty dry martini that we ordered was sweet and the lemon drop martini was vodka with a splash of lemon. The bartender was obnoxious and came over to tell us she's been a bartender for 2 years and her drinks are always mixed the same. Then when we asked for a manager she said she was the manager so we asked for her name and she said we didn't need to know. 
We also ordered gluten free soy sauce and when they brought it to the table there were bugs on it, which then were on the table. 
It's too bad that this restaurant is mismanaged because it's a great location and a great atmosphere inside. Hopefully they can figure it out."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last week and it was so good! Good food and great service!! I forgot his name but he seemed to be the only male server there, ask for him when you go in!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are big sushi fans and have recently discovered the cute restaurants in Litchfield Park, so we figured we would try out Blu Sushi on July 3rd.  I was very pleasantly surprised when we got inside.  The interior is very trendy,  modern, and welcoming.  There were plenty of seating options including the bar, lounge area, high top tables and outdoor seating.  

The food was very good, we tried 3 different rolls, a baked chicken teriyaki roll, the shrimp soybean roll and a traditional california roll.  The serving sizes on all of these was fantastic and the rolls all tasted very fresh.  The menu selection was huge, probably the biggest I've seen at a sushi restaurant, and so many of the items sounded good, it was hard to choose.

My only complaint was with the speed of our service.  We had fully looked through the menu and chosen our full meal before we were even offered a beverage.  Our edamame was also served last at the meal, even though we had ordered it as an appetizer.  Granted, I will cut the waitress some slack since the big 4th of July celebration was going on that night and they did seem pretty busy.

Overall though, we loved it, the sushi was great, the atmosphere was even better and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good. The waitress was very helpful. The place was empty except for a couple of bar dwellers. They played blues music, which didn't create a Japanese atmosphere. The sushi was pretty good, and so was the ramen. The chicken teriyaki was overdone and the yakisoba was sour/tangy. We also tried the udon which was ok. This experience seemed almost fusion (American/Japanese). Not so authentic if that is what you are looking for."}
{"text":"It was good and you get a TON of food, but be aware! It is sloowwwwwww. So go a little hungry and let your appetite build while you wait. Totally worth it in the end."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat sushi in surprise. Fun atmosphere good music and amazing food. I'll keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"I lived in Hawaii for 13 years, and I was pretty much convinced that I would never eat sushi in AZ. However, when I was getting my hair cut down the street, the nice girl mentioned that the owner of Blu Sushi was from Hawaii, which peaked my interest. 

I'm pregnant, so no raw fish for me, but there were plenty of delicious cooked items on the menu (including the happy hour menu) which I could eat. And eat I did! We tried several rolls (my favorite had crab, avo, and tempura fried on the outside), hamachi kama (which was insanely delicious), and chicken fried rice. Our selections may have sounded boring but our server was really nice and brought our food out the second it was ready. 

It was excellent. I am so over the west valley and the lack of good, independent restaurants here -- but I think we just found our new \"home\". :)"}
{"text":"I really cannot comment on the food since it never was served.  Waited to get a table, server never came.  We flagged down owner who took order but after an hour not even apps came out.  Server walked by and ignored us when we tried to get water.  After awhile we just left,  service was atrocious"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even greater service. This is a low key environment, romantic if you get seated in one of the corners. Richard the head chef will grant you any combination you'd like. We have been here more than a few times and every time the experience gets better!"}
{"text":"Service and environment was really good. The sushi was great. Really nice pieces of tuna and salmon used. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First off, let me preface this review with the fact that I've lived in Japan and I eat sushi several (3-4) times a week. I've eaten here once before, as it's closer to my house than my normal spot for sushi. The food was alright but not great, and overpriced, it was apparent that they were understaffed and the waitress knew very little about sushi, service was slow, food was okay, this was about 8 months ago.

I returned tonight because I wanted to give it another shot. I sat down at the sushi bar around 7:40, grabbed a Sapporo and ordered some sushi.  Again I could tell they were understaffed, the restaurant wasn't busy but for the lone waitress (who was definitely new) she was having a hard time going back and forth from the bar to the floor. The guy running the kitchen was coming out and grabbing plates and delivering food as well. First issue, no Uni, if it's on the menu, you need to have it. Otherwise write it on a board and call it special. Second issue, I waited forty minutes for my first plate of sashimi.  There were 4 other patrons at the sushi bar, both couples so really only three orders including mine. The restaurant was otherwise not busy. 

At 8:24 my sashimi was ready. After waiting this long for something so simple the chef decided I could wait a little longer by having the waitress pick the plate up from the other side of the bar and bring it to me, which took several minutes because as previously stated, they're understaffed. To a point I get it, training opportunity for the waitress, but you've got customers waiting nearly forty minutes for a plate of sushi that you could have easily handed to me but instead make the sole waitress bring it to me??  

The sashimi was not the worst part of the meal but it was definitely not up to par with the prices they charge at this restaurant. The salmon had pieces of sinew that made it not pleasant. The tuna was very fishy, this sounds like it goes without saying but sushi isn't supposed to taste this way. I'm not sure if it was stored wrong or just old. Not very good, which is surprising considering that they got the lone element of this dish wrong. Moving on, sushi chef disappeared for 10 minutes into the back.

After he returned my spicy tuna roll came out about ten minutes after that.  The flavor was bad, just like the flavor of the tuna sashimi I had previously. I decided I wasn't going to have anymore of it after three pieces. My final plate of unagi and ikura came out in a reasonable amount of time after the second and I had been craving ikura all day so this made me happy. 

I had the ikura first, wow.  Just wow. It was awful, I considered spitting it into my napkin but instead chose to fully eat it and analyze the flavor. Fishy, rotten, disgusting. Upon closer inspection of the other piece I noticed that the pearls appeared cloudy and dry on one side. Generally ikura is beautiful red glossy pearls spilling over the edge of the nori. I've never seen ikura like this, it had to have been old, needless to say I didn't have the second piece. 

I was left with the Unagi nigiri.  I have literally never had a piece of unagi that wasn't great, I mean, grilled eel with sweet, thick, black sauce on top of rice, what's not to love about that?  This particular unagi was absolutely drenched in the sauce though, and I couldn't figure out why?  I mean it's a good sauce but that's just unnecessary. After having the first piece I realized why...it had been overcooked to the point of the skin being charred, the bitter burnt flavor of the skin cut straight through the ridiculous amount of eel sauce that was applied and I decided my meal was over at that point. 

Nearly an hour and a half into my dinner and I received the check. Tip included $60.  Not bad for good sushi but absolutely not worth it for the subpar food being served up at this place. I will never go back."}
{"text":"6 people and all six loved this place.  They voted 5 out of 5.  This place is great food and the drinks were all good. Been here before and will continue to support.   Ninja was great, lobster tail sushi was good.  Let's continue to support."}
{"text":"Hands down the most creative sushi chef on the west side. Never had a bad experience at Blu. The owner is great and comes to talk to us every time we go in, which is about twice a month. If you don't know what you want, ask the chef to make something special for you and he will. Awesome hole in the wall decor. This is the best place I'm the west valley."}
{"text":"SO Verdict... Read below if you need the why, Blu Sushi has a great menu and the food is very good, if they managed to figure out the service and pricing then it has my vote but the lack of this gives them 2 stars.... So much more to be desired from yet another attempt at west valley dinning.

This time we stopped by the Blu Sushi that has been here for several years but we have yet to give it a shot.  We showed up on a Saturday evening, there was 5 people at the sushi bar, about 4 tables seated with one descent table of 6 people. 

The restaurant is nicely done, there was definitely some chedda vested here and the sound system and tv bring it a nice subtle but still classy touch.  

There were two sushi chefs and some sou chefs in kitchen and a total of 2 servers which btw includes them as hostesses.  

We ordered edaname, and their tea to start.  For dinner we did the baked salmon over california roll, the scallops special roll and the killer shrimp, my wife ordered her usual side of rice (we will talk about this in a moment.

The server was very mellow not too friendly, typical for these places so not a worry.  But there was a problem and clearly they were taking to long to bring out our edaname, after 20 minutes we had it.  

Another 20 minutes came and no food, typically these joints will bring out a nice small salad or mizo, nothing. Finally the server came by and said something I didn't understand but she brought a dish with some tempura jalapeños with cream cheese and said sorry for wait.  She put it on my side of table leaving my pregnant wife wondering what that was about.  I appreciate the appeasement but I would prefer better service.  

Another 15 minutes passed by and I get my scallops special, again my poor wife waits.  Finally 15 minutes later she gets some rice, okay we are getting started together.  Then another 5 minutes comes the killer shrimp and we are enjoying it but notice another 15 minutes passing and no seared sashimi and also we still were waiting on another dish. It finally came and we were definitely disappointed by then.

The total for this evening not including any alcohol was 68 bucks, definitely on the high end but worth it if they figured out the service."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. It is a good place to hang out with friends it is quiet and the food is great. I have one complaint that they have things on their menu and do not carry or now how to make it. Other then that their rolls are good, not authentic Japanese food but the American rolls are superb."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The owner is fantastic and he is a master sushi chef. After several very successful restaurants in Los Angeles he has set down roots in AZ and you cannot miss this place. One of THE best sushi bars around for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Sushi but when my daughter visits we go here. I really like the atmosphere and the overall casual, friendly experience. My daughter, who is a Sushi connoisseur, having worked at such restaurants herself, really likes it too. Every time she visits requires at least one trip to the Blu Sushi Lounge & Grill."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We came on a recommendation and were not pleased. 

The good: $5 sake bombers

The miso soup was fine, but pricey. I ordered a regular side salad which was $3.99 and what I got was a small amount of very cheap American blend (iceburg, cabbage, carrot). It shouldn't have been served, it looked old and it tasted like dirt, no flavor of dressing at all.

The sushi was fine, but small quantity for the price. 

I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent and priced fairly. 
Good spot to go and beautiful to sit outside during the day!"}
{"text":"Very, very over priced. The sushi is good but you get a much better value for outstanding sushi at Akai Hana, who also has a great HH. I've been to Blu twice and probably won't go back because it's just not worth the money.

So apparently the owner or some employee doesn't like my review and assumes that bcuz I prefer a different restaurant that I must work there...ridiculous! Lol"}
{"text":"Not happy to write a negative review about this place. I was really excited to try it because it's in a great location, got great reviews and has outdoor seating! The reason I gave two stars instead of one is because the waitress we had was really wonderful, attentive and friendly. 
Sadly, the sushi was very disappointing. I don't know if it's because we were there in the afternoon, it was just a bad day for the chef, or this is just how it always is. It was like they had to add a large amount of sauce (chili sauce, eel sauce, etc) to compensate for the rolls not tasting very good. The sauces overpowered any other flavor and to me, the sauces tasted...for lack of a better term...cheap-y? For example, the chili sauce on one of our rolls tasted like Ketchup. Yuck. And let me tell you, I was really trying to like this place.
Also, so weird. We got sake bombs, which were $5 (awesome!). Sadly, and weirdly, the sake tasted like fried food! I don't know if their sake sits close to their fryer, or what, but it was so gross. Luckily you could ALMOST cover the flavor by mixing it with beer, but it was still hard to drink.
All in all, I am sad to say I will not be going back. The best part was the service, which was also probably because there weren't many people there when we were."}
{"text":"I love Richard he is incredible!!support our local small businesses.  Amazing sashimi."}
{"text":"I thought I reviewed this place already as much as I go here. I've tried a handful of sushi in PHX and this is my spot. The sushi itself is great, combine that with a prime location and Richard the owner locking you in to a good convo as he precisely constructs the rolls, this place can be your everyday stop for a quick bite, quick drink, big dinner, or group gathering. Prices are right where they should be and its never hit or miss. Always on point."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! Excellent service! If you sit at the sushi bar, ask for Andrew. He is the man!"}
{"text":"The sushi and drinks were awesome, the service was crazy. We sat there for 15 minutes to even have someone bring us water"}
{"text":"We love this place! The bar is inconsistent as is expected for a small restaurant but they are eager to please and will make you something special if they are out of what you want.  The Cherry Blossom roll deserves the high reviews others have noted. Sit at the bar and watch the show the owner and sushi chef delivers. He is full of good information and loves what he does.  Ask for Lexy to wait on you.  She is great. We live in Tucson but when in town visiting family, make the long trip out here and are never sorry.  Absolutely fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Here I sit.... My first sushi place I'm going to try since arriving in phx today. Haven't eaten since this morning and is now 8:30 pm. What I was hoping for, a fairly quick stop, has now turned into 45 minutes and no sushi! Looks like the cook didn't show up so 1 person is doing it all. Correction.. The owner likes to do it all on Mondays I am told. We shall see if it was worth the wait. Later... Still waiting.... It's arrived!!  Sashimi tasted fresh and the rolls were very good. I am def a connoisseur of sushi. Been to the best and eat it all the time.  The slow service kind of spoiled the occasion for me. I will try them one more time to see if they should have been 4 stars if service. My server was very nice. Not surprised since she's from South Carolina. Very nice with great southern hospitality."}
{"text":"Tried this place numerous times and every time the service gets worse. The waiters do not pay attention to their tables or guests and ignore them regularly."}
{"text":"Great knowledgable staff. They make custom rolls which I love. I have some favorites that most places won't or can't do. They have some unique rolls. I'm a huge sushi snob and I will be back every time I'm in town. Great job to the staff if you are reading this!"}
{"text":"Good tasting, nice ambiance, and friendly.

Little pricey tho, but that's what you get when you are across the street from the Wigwam Resort.

I love the area... the green of Old Litchfield Road always pleases me and I like that you get to park on the street. (can you tell I've lived in Phoenix my whole life? lol)  Almost has an Old Town Scottsdale feel to the area.

The decor inside the restaurant was tastefully modern.  A very small sushi bar, but with a large alcohol bar.  The dining room doubles as a dance floor, according to the disco ball hanging above it.

My sister and I went... she was the one who recommended this place and lives in the area.

We had the edamame (which was excellent... I don't know how other restaurants manage to mess up edamame, but these were good) and veggie and calamari tempura as an appetizer.

To me, calamari tempura is a waste of time.  There was no seasoning and it was very bland, so I guess it's geared more for the texture eater.

We had the Arizona roll (awesomely spicy), the Yellowtail Lovers roll (not bad, but slightly fishy, which isn't normal for yellowtail), and the Las Vegas roll.

The Las Vegas roll was the biggest Las Vegas roll I have ever seen in my life.  Naturally, it's a large piece anyway with the cream cheese, avocado and eel and deep fried, but this had spicy crab on top with the eel sauce drizzled over it.  

You cannot eat those pieces in one bite... trust me, I tried. lol (I about made my sister blow tea out her nose, laughing)

I wish I could because it's great all together... very complementary flavors.

The people were nice too... they were joking around with each other and very tolerant of our loud laughing in the nearly empty restaurant."}
{"text":"What an amazing sushi bar!!! Rick (owner) is the chef.  He is engaging, and truly cares about his craft!  Sarah our hostess was friendly and a joy to spend time with.  After the Monkey Brains appetizer, We had the fire roll (barbecue sushi... who knew?!?!?) the Blu Roll as well as some incredible yellow fin sashimi and salmon sashimi.  Everything here was fresh delicious and perfectly prepared.  Thank you so much for making our night out unforgettable!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I go on regular sushi dates and chose Blu because of all the wonderful reviews here on Yelp.  We were extremely disappointed!  They have happy hour everyday from 3-6 and so we went on Sunday around 4.  There were only about 6 people inside so we sat at the sushi bar.  

We ordered spicy tuna rolls and crab tempura rolls on the happy hour menu as well as the shrimp soybean paper roll off of their regular menu.  I'd like to say I've had enough sushi from a large handful of places in Arizona so I know what a yummy spicy tuna roll is.  

The spicy tuna rolls they brought out were extremely gummy because the rice was well over done.  Now, the tuna itself was very tasty and perfectly spicy.  I also really loved that cucumber was added so there was a nice little crunch.  But the gumminess completely ruined it and I had a hard time wanting to not gag.  

As for the crab tempura rolls, the crab was imitation and that made me really annoyed seeing as how the ratings were high here and the prices on their menu are as well.  A place like this should not be using imitation crab.  The rolls were completely tasteless!  :( 

Our favorite (if that's what you want to call it) was the shrimp soybean paper roll.  But again, the crab was imitation and lacked flavor so the entire roll was off.  It was not rolled tight at all either.  

Something else I did not think I'd see at a place with such high ratings was a sushi chef that would be sitting at the bar (not the sushi bar) drinking a pint of beer with a customer.  When we were finished and leaving he was outside in front of the restaurant sitting on the patio with the same customer smoking a cigarette as well.  Hmmmmmmm.

I do not plan on going back even thoiugh there was one or two rolls I wanted to try.  I was completely put off by the gumminess of the rice because I've never had sushi with that issue and I was DEFNITELY not happy to be eating imitation crab at a place that I had thought was higher end.  Not okay at all!"}
{"text":"I ask that you please DO NOT give the owner here your business. Although I have been to this location many times as a local and they have decent sushi, the last few times the service has been very slow. Last night we were there and from the time we ordered it took an hour and a half to get our food. The waitress was very nice and apologetic, but when we spoke to the owner who was making the sushi, he literally WAVED HIS KNIFE in my brother's face. He refused to give us any discount even though we missed the rest of our evening plans. He was very rude and did not apologize, but rather made excuses. He lost our business forever which is a shame since we probably would have returned."}
{"text":"All of our rolls were delicious and full of flavor, our favorite roll was the Baja roll... The staff was more than outstanding. 
Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Painful experience!! Very nice server....Very AWFUL service. Apparently a 1/2 full restaurant on a Friday evening at 6:00 is \"the dinner rush\" and is unmanagable. After waiting 1/2 hour for our final roll, I asked for desert TO GO and the check when it was brought to the table. Got those lickety split but after finishing our food and waiting another 10 minutes for the check to be picked up and cashed out I finally went and handed it to a waitress, told her I was leaving and someone needed to run the payment. Manager came over to ask if there was a problem... Ummmm YES - the fact that I had to track someone down to have my billed paid should be a concern, never mind the snails pace of service. \"We only have 1 sushi chef and it's the dinner rush\"...sorry not an acceptable excuse. Better not leave Litchfield Park if that's a rush...you'll get run over on the other side of the 101."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now, and I am ready to give it the coveted five star review. Everything is on. We enjoyed the trendy industrial ambiance, great service and delicious sushi. The fish was very fresh, and the place is fun."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed! Came with friends for lunch an there was no sushi chef. Waitress was nice about telling us she was trying to get in contact with him. I've been several times recently and the service has declined and the wait times for food has increased. This was the last straw and I won't be back! Such a shame as this was a good place."}
{"text":"Japanese Burrito is the bomb! Remember folks, sushi is an art form, it takes awhile...be patient."}
{"text":"So, let me begin by saying we really tried to give Blu a chance. We have been to Blu a number of times and the sushi is actually good, especially compared to other Japanese fare in the West Valley. That being said, the total experience is always a disaster. Last night for example, there was only one server and one sushi chef. The restaurant was nearly empty and it still took us over an hour to even see our first roll come out... and this is not an isolated experience. Our server was apologetic, but didn't offer any appetizer on the house or any other kind of recovery. It's clear that the disorganization and lack of communication between management, server, and the kitchen is a huge problem. Sorry Blu, just can't do it."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi.  Stopped in this past weekend and tried the Cheetah roll.  At first I thought it was a weird combo - made with flaming hot cheetos but OMG - it was SO good.  The manager and staff are so friendly - makes it really fun to visit."}
{"text":"We have visited Blu Sushi many times now and they are consistently good. We order the sushi and it is always fresh. Our only complaint was that it felt like they didn't have the air on...it was a little toasty. The food was great."}
{"text":"We used to go to blu for good sushi. But the good sushi comes at a price, lackluster service, long waits, and higher prices. Decided after last time not a place to hit before a movie (you won't make the movie) nor on date night (the babysitter ends up costing more due to the fact that your night just got twice as long).  Even when I stopped by to buy a gift card it took almost half an hour, seriously wow!  A couple hours of waiting at this place that I will never get back."}
{"text":"I eat here whenever I get the chance! The sushi is probably the best in town and the lunch specials make it affordable! I haven't found the other food to be anything out of the ordinary, but the sushi makes the trip to old town worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this sushi spot! The food is always fresh, the ambiance is nice, and the owner is a really nice and interesting guy to talk too. I always enjoy my time at Blu."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday, decent size crowd. We order the monkey brains to start with.  It was delicious almost sinfully so. Followed up with the chicken katsu, tiger roll, and sashimi. It was all delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked, sashimi was fresh, and the tiger was delicious. We will come back again. mmmm monkey brains"}
{"text":"Went here for sushi take out and ordered shrimp tempura rolls....I have to say I was disappointed with them after reading the reviews on here I was expecting much better....the sushi rolls were thrown into a little to go box as if they were in a hurry but when I got there they really didn't seem like they were that busy....nothing special about this place as far as I can see to warrent a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"My fiance and I LOVE our sushi so we came on Yelp to find a nerby sushi place with a good happy hour. We didnt know this place had come under new management though, so they had gotten rid of their happy hour. It wasn't easy to spot. It's located right across the street from the Wigwam Resort & Spa. The surrounding area was beautiful. Trees lit up with lights on the street, tranquil neighboorhood. And the inside was just as wonderful. It looked a little upscale, the decor was pretty, even has a lounge area across the sushi bar, but still very laid back.  We showed up the night the new managment was taking over. The owner was there and was very attentive. The sushi chef was very knowledgeable and offered several recommendations. I ordered a specialty roll and he was happy to make it. It was delicious and fairly cheap. Only $9 for that special roll. The other rolls were a bit pricey, but well worth it. The quality was excellent. 

The place was only about half full that night. Our food came out fairly quick since we were sitting at the sushi bar. The owner served complimentary sake shots for the house and we all toasted together. It felt like a very chill and welcoming place. The wait staff is very friendly. We've been back since our first time here and we haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Absolutely the greatest, freshest sushi I've ever had. Sushi Chef Richard really takes the time to talk to you and get to know you while making your sushi right in front of you! Sushi Chef Richard always remembers a face and sometimes goes crazy with different sushi.

I sometimes ask him to \"just make something\". I am never disappointed at what he makes!"}
{"text":"i was amazed at how fresh the fish was here .Delicious sashimi assortments that melted in my mouth . I was super excited by everything I had at this establishment ."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is amazing here!! Love the sushi rolls and potstickers! Staff is always friendly and I've had timely service every visit!"}
{"text":"I've gotten take out here three times (small children at home) and loved it.  I love the baked rolls and for a simple lunch the california roll with crab."}
{"text":"Just average 

I have to admit I love sushi and enjoy dining at as many sushi bars as I can.  Today, I decided to visit Blue Sushi. 

Blu Sushi has a very inviting atmosphere.  There's a large sushi bar in the center with tables set about the remaining space.  

The Sushi at Blue Sushi  is usually  good. However, the service tends to be a little unpredictable, especially on busy weekend nights.  

On this visit we shared Diamondback Rolls, Philadelphia Rolls, Garlic Edema-me, and Salmon.  The salmon and Philadelhia were fresh and flavorful. The Garlic Edema-me was wonderful and happens to be one of my favorite menu items at Blue Sushi.
The Diamondback Roll were not good at all.  The crab had an odd taste that is difficult to describe. 

If you want to try Blue Sushi I suggest you visit during Happy Hour the prices  are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The West Valley really needs a good sushi bar.  But Blu isn't it.

Went for lunch with my sushi buddy.  Neither one of us was impressed.  It's kinda barren, cold, sterile looking.  I don't think our waitress ever tasted sreal sushi in her life.  The sushi chef never acted like he understood a thing we ordered - and I ordered one of their lunch specials.  He screwed it up and the manager got me the right thing, plus whatever it was he made by mistake was free.  Good thing, it wasn't very good and we couldn't understand what the chef said it was.

Another place to take off my list!"}
{"text":"I've been sat here for an hour with no food. The place is packed and only one chef. I've had good experiences before when the place wasn't busy but this is just ridiculous.  They lost my business."}
{"text":"Returned last week after a couple of years of living somewhere else and have to say the quality of the food and service has gone down hill considerably. 
We went during lunch and had standard rolls - Vegas and Philadelphia. Neither were very good, they tasted as if they had fillers in them. 
I noticed that the prices had gone down but thought that was because it was the lunch menu, unfortunately with the price the quality went as well.
As for the service; it took a very long time to get our food although it wasn't busy. we sat outside and we had to go inside to get our waitress a couple of times. Once because a dish was dirty and at the end to request our check. She checked on us once in between. 
I probably won't be returning to Blue."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Can't beat the 1.75 draft beer. Delicious spicy tuna tempura rolls. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"It was very difficult to get a read on this restaurant from its uneven reviews.  I was at the Wigwam resort for a conference and my room was across the street from Blu.  I was hungry after checking in and decided to see for myself.

The restaurant was practically empty (it was Wednesday night near closing time).  I thought the restaurant was very good and retuned with a colleague the next afternoon.  I had a variety of rolls, including the very spicy Inferno roll.  Every one was very good.  Service was excellent and prompt.  Granted, the restaurant was not crowded, but I was more than satisfied.  

If I came back to the Wigwam, I would certainly put Blu on my list."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here ! Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. The owner even comes by to say hello."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my wife.  We always eat sushi when we are without the kids and Blu Sushi was pretty good for the west valley.  A bit pricy but they have good happy hour specials every weekday.    Hot Nite roll was really good.  Next time we'll go back during happy hours to save a few bucks.  Really expensive cocktails...  Like $11 each."}
{"text":"Sushi is amazing! So is the service especially by Sam. We always go based of her recommendations and we have not once been disappointed.

Musty try!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great menu and very affordable. Happy hour menu is great as well as drink specials. Atmosphere is great in a great part of downtown LP. Service has been hit or miss."}
{"text":"I've gone to a lot of sushi restaurants throughout the valley and I keep returning to Blu Sushi for it great selection of rolls and there quality. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"I work at Blu Sushi... The reason I am writing this review is because of a previous review that I read.  

A Yelper stated that Richard (the owner) yells at the waitresses and disrespects his staff.  

This is simply not the case.  I have worked in the service industry for 15+ years from being a dishwasher all the way to a general manager.  

It is rare in this industry that you get the opportunity to work for someone like Richard.  He takes his staff out to lunch every few months.  He keeps his calm when the stress gets high.  He understands that people make mistakes.  He is a respectful person.  He is one of those people that others enjoy being in the company of.

I have never heard him raise his voice in anger.  

Like anyone in his position would, there are job expectation and he makes them clear but in a respectful way.  He wants his restaurant running effectively and everything as clean and orderly as possible.

I have another full time job as a teacher.  I don't NEED this job.  I work here because I truly enjoy it.  

About the restaurant.....

If you are looking for a quick dinning experience, some place to get in and out I suggest visiting for lunch when it is slower.  Dinner at  Blu is a longer more relaxing experience.  The sushi chefs are very detail oriented.  They take their time, so as to turn out a quality product... this is the type of restaurant for people looking for a relaxing evening.  

Yes, there were some quality of service issues in the past as well.  Richard has owned this restaurant (he was a former owner who bought it back)  for about 3 months.  He is trying to get a solid staff in place and for those that were on the receiving end of that trial period, my deepest sympathies.  I mean that, eating out should be an event and a treat, less than quality service can really put a damper on that. 

Just my 2 cents.... I am Kelly the weekend bartender.  If you come in stop by and say hi."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best sushi and so many choices. Kinda expensive tho. Ignore the yelp menu prices as they are not accurate!!"}
{"text":"This place has a new owner/operater named Dennis he's really cool and cleared out the old satff and rude servers mentioned in these other reviews, and brought the prices down to a more reasonable level,Blusushi is now EXACTLY what it should be,delicious food,friendly servers in a stylish setting,the drinks are made right the sushi is awesome. check it out ,We'll be going back for sure :-)"}
{"text":"Blu Sushi = the new Sam's Club; quantity over quality.  

I used to eat at Blu Sushi 3-4 times a week for the past year.  This was unequivocally the best sushi spot in the Valley , not just the West Valley.  The fish was of the highest quality, the rolls contained no 
\"filler\" ingredients, and the atmosphere was very laid-back yet upscale at the same time.  

Blu went under new ownership recently and the place has lapsed into mediocrity as a result.    Following the transition to new ownership, I dined at Blu 5-6 times giving the new owners ample time to orient themselves to the restaurant.  Each time, however, was very clear that Blu Sushi is no longer the high-quality sushi it was under the old guard.   

The new owners promptly fired all of the previous chefs, wait staff, and bartenders.  The owners brought in their relatives as replacements for all employees.  Truly, this is not an exaggeration, all of the new staff are either children or close relatives of the owners.  Which would not be a problem except all personnel are highly inexperienced and definitely a cost-saving mechanism for the new ownership.  

Cutting corners to save cost is the cornerstone of Blu's new business model.  Where quality, knowledge, and classiness used to be status quo, the rolls are now filled with \"krab,\" mayo, and rice as opposed to fresh fish and quality ingredients.  Other reviewers mention how big the rolls are and how they left with a full stomach, which they found to be a positive attribute of Blu.  People are impressed with the size of Blu's rolls because the food indeed fills your stomach.  However, the roll consists entirely of filler ingredients rather than quality fish.   

The corner-cutting is apparent in other areas as well.  The upscale decor has been replaced by tacky blinking neon signs, and the chefs and waitstaff have no idea what they are doing.  Sushi rolls are rolled so loosely they fall apart at the first touch.  Most orders come out of the kitchen incorrectly, but the waitresses have no idea how to fix it and always have to summon the owner to your table in order to answer a question.  Normally I would applaud the owner's presence as a commitment to customer service and excellence, but in this case it is just another cost saving mechanism meant to replace experience.  The new owners clearly have no idea how to run a restaurant and seem highly confused.    

I have 2 recommendations, one for potential customers and one for the new owners.  To potential customers: If you are thinking of dining here, do yourself a favor and make the drive to another place.  Unless you are easily distracted by large portion portion volume and think that quantity replaces quality, you will be disappointed.  To to those individuals who are impressed by large quantities of bad food, you can save yourself the money and visit McDonalds and answer \"yes\" when asked if you would like to \"Super Size It.\"   

To the new owners: hire back everyone you just fired, to include the chef and the waitstaff.  It should be a clue to you how bad your restaurant is when none of the loyal regular customers have continued to frequent your establishment.  You turned the best sushi place into a low-quality dump whose only mission is to cut corners and pander to tourists."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings for this place.  Love the vibe and the service.  The food was just ok.  The katsu was too dry.  But the dessert (tempura cheesecake) was very good, but a tad soggy."}
{"text":"We had the best experience. We are sushi goers and we ordered the Marilyn Monroe, geisha roll, and spicy crunch roll. It is slightly expensive, but the service is top notch and we were impressed  with our overall experience. The drinks were divine, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Blue sushi? Should be called SLOW sushi.....the owner/sushi chef is very impersonable....Would hate to see this place busy....we waited over  10 mins for first beer then 40 mins for first roll. The table behind us waited 2 hours according to the waitress who laughed that off!  Unbelieveable. Don't go.....try ah-so sushi  on pebble creek...we won't go back! That's for sure....there's the fish the sea! !"}
{"text":"I came here for a girls night out and it was fantastic! Happy hour cocktails were delicious! Their sour apple martinis were just $5 and gave us girls a good buzz. 

Their sushi is amazing and fresh. I'm happy to finally find a good sushi restaurant in Arizona. 

The service could've been a bit more prompt and the food could've came out quicker. But the waitress was really nice and overall we had an amazing start to our night here.

I will be back soon !"}
{"text":"Happy hour prices to die for! With a large kiren and 3 rolls 27 bucks, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I was actually torn between giving a three or four star review. 3 1/2 is probably more appropriate. The place looks pretty hip and fun. The prices are a little high for some of the roles that would typically be a lot less at any other establishment I've ever been to. Some of them are more expensive than even the most expensive sushi places I've been to. Which are in the hundreds by now. The sushi was OK once we got it. However the biggest disappointment of the night was the waitress who was a complete idiot. She was kind of cute in for tacious but she was horrible at her job. She had about 8 feet to walk to the sushi bar and drink bar. It took forever to get a drink. She kept telling us she didn't forget about us and that it would take another 15 minutes to get anything. They only had one sushi chef and lots of people ordering so it took a long time to get our rolls."}
{"text":"I can't give any star, made reservation and got here on time which we didn't need. Order a bottle of wine but our server Sarah brought me s glass of wine instead and after I told her I wanted a bottle of wine she brought me a bottle but no glass, oh hello, it's two of us having a dinner. Our sushi didn't come out for 45 minutes and spider roll had a few ants crawling on a plate. It took another 30 minutes to have replacement sushi. And our server Sarah is busy talking to a guy seating on a bar than bring me some more ginger. Stop talking to your boyfriend or whatever and serve your table. Wow, they give us 10% discount like that will make up for the f*** up for tonight. It doesn't matter what freebies you offer nothing will make me ever come here again. I'll never be in this place again and Sarah, get s new job. This isn't for you because you suck at waiting on a table. Your tip for tonight is a penny."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Everyone is friendly from the bottom to the top.... Especially, Jamie the bartender.  Not only is she super, super, hot.... But she's friendly and knowledgeable too! And the drinks and sushi are absolutely top notch.  Highly recommend you check it out.... The the Lobster Tail Special...A+++++. And if you're lucky you might get the owner Jenny to take a shot with you!"}
{"text":"In town for a meeting and went there last night. Owner omnipresent, very nice and very interested in making the place work. There are kinks to be worked out. There was some disorganization in the kitchen but the effort to correct it is there. Sushi, by the way, was very good."}
{"text":"Great rolls and the shrimp tempura is delish! I went with a friend from college and we both enjoyed our time here. Not only the price is decent, the place is quite simple and has a good atmosphere. A nice place to eat sushi peacefully. Another great thing about it is that I can order take outs, really cool!"}
{"text":"Literally... LITERALLY... sitting in the restaurant right now. Waiting 1 hour for our food. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE experience. The wait staff are running around and don't communicate with each other. We keep getting excuse after excuse. The restaurant is really not that busy. There are lots of empty tables. They are already messing up orders. They took our order down. 1 hour and I ONLY got a bowl of miso soup. Bad bad bad... not worth going. The only good thing here was the busboy Matthew, he tried to help us."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! The decor, the service, and not just the food but how it is displayed were all beautifully done. Some of the best sushi i've had in the area so far. Will definitely make sure to visit again."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is the best sushi I have ever had. I sat at the bar and had a very attentive waitress. I had the chirarshi (sashimi chef's choice) and a rainbow roll, and it was fantastic. Prices are fairly standard; they're not overpriced, but the quality was top notch.
I could go on and on, but just go there and try it. Blu's food will speak for itself.
After reading a few other comments, I will add that the menu clearly states that the primary krabmeat available is imitation but crab can be substituted for real crabmeat for (if I remember correctly) 2 dollars extra."}
{"text":"New sushi bar across the street from the Wig Wam resort. I live in Hawaii and used to great sushi prepared by real Japanese trained chefs. I can tell you the sushi at blu is excellent. I had the Hamachi nigiri sushi that was melt in your mouth. Blu is heavy into sushi rolls that I guess mainlanders think is real sushi, but can also do the traditional sushi perfectly. The prices are down right cheap for sushi this good. Some mega dinner combos are from $15 to $20 that could feed a horse. Very stylish interior. Nice to see some original restaurants out here instead of the chain, strip mall BS. 

If you like sushi, give it a try and say \"HI\" to Shinji the master chef."}
{"text":"Not the worst sushi I've ever had in my life, but far from the best. I don't consider myself a prude, but do find the selection of music (all revolving around sex) a bit odd for 2pm on a Thursday...."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, but slow.  The sushi was sub par to say the least. The fish was a bit \"fishy\" and the rolls were not that inspired."}
{"text":"This is my husband and i's favorite sushi place. The rolls are fresh, original but simple. The restaurant itself is beautiful and they have an adorable outdoor patio. I would highly recommend this place and I am very picky when it comes to food sushi. We normally go a at least once a week!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for sushi! The staff is great & the food is excellent! I highly recommend the tears of ninja as a starter! Yum!"}
{"text":"Coconut Shrimp, Monkey Brain (stuffed mushrooms), Vegas and Geisha rolls were amazing!! Entrees were good, but smaller portion than a few other places. Rice on entrees were a bit dry for my liking. 

Prices a little higher for Litchfield. Service was great, place was clean, and trendy atmosphere. Menu is a good size with many different types of rolls to try, more reason to come back. A happy hour menu on weekend like other places would be nice.

Will definitely come back but most likely with just the wife and minus kids. Pricey....."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our sushi when the restaurant was half full.  Other tables were served their sushi that came in 20 minutes after us.  The hot saki was warm at best and tasted stale.  Terrible experience for the price.  We will never be back."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I had the Lemon roll and Sashimi salad, absolutely delicious! The sushi was very fresh and delightful. Definitely coming back:)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved into this area, and we are definitely sushi people. This place is honestly awesome. Our server was very sweet and let us know of their happy hour deals - which were great! The atmosphere was very quiet, comforting, and they even allowed a guest with a cute dog to enjoy the patio seating which was great too! Definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The service was good. Place was very clean. It was semi busy, so there was a wait for our food, but not too bad. I ordered a drink and it was not good at all. Our server gave me a beer and took back the mixed drink (did not charge for the mixed). The garlic edamame was delicious! We ordered a sushi roll that was literally on fire (on purpose) It was ok. Too many flavors going on.  The other rolls we ordered were good, I just don't remember the names. We also got an order of fried salmon skin on the house, which was very good and I don't like salmon skin."}
{"text":"First off we didnt go for sushi which is very good I hear.We went for the Japanese food.We got the calamari which was rubber wrapped in batter that came off the fish.The other tempora wasnt great either.Teriyaki chicken was ok.Korean BBQ was not worth it.Blu combo was nothing to write home about as was the noodle soup.Ive had better japanese at strip malls."}
{"text":"very disappointed in service and the 'chef' had a terrible attitude when I complained that my dinner was not ever served and my husband had finished his meal. 'Sushi chef guy' loudly proclaimed that he could not serve shellfish raw. ( I had ordered spider roll), of course I realize that... I suspect my order had not been turned in until I complained. Everyone else in the dining room had arrived after we did. They were served and finishing their meals before I received my single roll. We will NEVER GO BACK. BE CAREFUL AT THIS PLACE.  .  .  the staff is NOT trustworthy. Zero stars"}
{"text":"Avoid this place! Took nearly and hour and a half to get food! The server said that is about standard since they only have 1 sushi chef! Hello its a Friday night! Prices were high compared to other local places. Quality of food was average at best. Server was actually friendly and would do much better if she went somewhere else that had faster plate times. I suggest aki hana right up the road. Much better."}
{"text":"The dancing starts at 10! Drinks only.

Okay so we came on a Friday night, it was so busy.... finally got a table. Finally got our sushi, a waitress quit,  but we're still here after closing and didn't get kicked out. So I guess we'll be back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, it was good.  The owner gave me a sample of some deep fried red snapper with creamy white sauce, Great!  It was a lot cheaper than other places, but hey it's still sushi  Ordered spicy tuna roll and tuna, both were very tasty!  Nice staff"}
{"text":"Yellow tail sashimi was absolutely amazing. Perfectly paired spicy, sweet, savory combo. Wonderful service and all around vibe. Love the interior decor as well! Would come back every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Only 6 people in the entire resteraunt on a Friday evening, yet still could not get our food right.
Ordered french fries for our child and they were still raw in the middle. Wife ordered the $25 steak and shrimp which came out 10 minutes before my meal (bulgolgi), yet her steak was cold. Will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Salmon sashimi - excellent.  Great texture, color and temp.  RA sushi should take a lesson from Blu and learn a thing or two!  Prompt and courteous service made the experience that much better.  Would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I have been since leaving Oregon and relocating to AZ. The sushi rolls are phenomenal and creative. Not your average sushi rolls! My fiancé and I had the Baha roll which was a seasonal roll. It was spicy tuna, avocado and crap on the inside with yellowtail on the outside, then it had a combination of ponzu, Japanese pesto, dots of siracha and finally it was sprinkled with baby arugula! It was worth a trip just for that roll! The waitress was awesome and very patient as we tried to decide which rolls to order and was able to answer all of our questions. We will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I think Blu has gotten a bit of a bad rep for their prices. I believe you get what you pay for and I am willing to pay a bit more to dine here. 
The ambiance is wonderful.. calm, clean, chill and welcoming. The staff is great.. friendly and knowledgeable is all I ask of servers and they definitely succeed at that. They don't have a large drink menu or wine list but every drink I have ordered I have absolutely loved, the latest drink I had was called a blu martini (I think that's the name; I may have had a few more then just one so the name may be wrong). As for the sushi its delicious, the arizona roll is spicy, fresh and scrumptious. My friends swear by the las vegas roll and my boyfriend loves the tears of ninja appetizer. Of course all the rolls you can find at any sushi joint (california roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll, etc.) are great. 
If you ever find yourself on the way west side its absolutely worth a trip in. I actually like it better than any of the sushi's restaurant's in the east/central phoenix area."}
{"text":"This was my family go to Japanese restaurant for  years, but no more. We were a small party of 4 but because of the crowd for Red, White, and Boom we were put on the couches. Our server was nice, but alas she was the only one. My husband ordered hot sake and tempura appetizers. Our server came back with the carafe and a glass for hot sake. You don't serve hot sake in a glass and they never had before in the six years we have been coming. He asked the man behind the sushi bar. He initially told him no and this where it goes sideways. Husband tells him  he's not happy. The woman behind the bar says the chef says he will not cook our food and that we need to leave. The guy behind the sushi bar starts arguing and cursing. I mean he was dropping f-bombs at my husband loud enough for other patrons to take notice. My husband remained respectful but refused to pay for the 40.00 in food they refused to cook for us just for the drinks the server gave us. In the end, we paid for just the drinks, but only after they made my husband lose face by cursing at him. I have been in restaurants all over the world, including Japan and was never treated so rudely or asked to leave before."}
{"text":"Richard and the team are amazing. Happy hour prices run until 7, so you can try a lot of different things for a great price. Sit at the bar and ask your chef to make you a chef's choice selection. They love the opportunity to be creative when they aren't slammed."}
{"text":"Don't bother sitting in the general dining area. You will wait too long to get your drink refilled and order taken. Sit at the sushi bar and let Richard spoil you. That is all."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment today and I am not impressed or satisfied. Let me start by saying that I went to this restaurant due to a recommendation; which I will never listen to him again. So I first tried to go there on two different Wednesdays at 1130 to 1200. They were closed both times, then this final time instead of driving over first I called and they were actually open during their normal business hours. I finally am able to order and since they are closing on Friday, they don't have half the stuff that I originally ordered. I settled for different options, which were all gross. The teriyaki chicken is NOT supposed to be breaded, the crab puffs were bland, the sushi was not even fresh, and the rice was not cleaned all the way. Even my sister said her drink tasted funny. The whole place is just dusty and you can tell it is not operated efficiently. The edamame was okay, and the server was very attentive to us ( I would hope so we were his only table). However, the server needs to have an actual uniform instead of a muscle t-shirt and black paints. He looks like he just came from the gym, not at a job. Not only, that, but the reason I stopped eating and asked for the check was because 1) the food was gross and 2) two ants had crawled on my plate when I was eating. I was the worst experience ever. We took the food in a container and once I told my sister outside, we throw it out. In conclusion, I would NEVER tell anyone to eat here, I am glad they are closing, there prices are higher than the quality that they serve it for (in certain sushi places in SCOTTSDALE are cheaper and better) and if I could give negative stars for this review I would give it a -10 stars."}
{"text":"Went back to Blu the other night.  We ordered the Arizona Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll again as well as the Marilyn Mon Roll and the Las Vegas Roll.  Everything was delicious!  The Las Vegas Roll is huge!  The waitress was very attentive and friendly.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I am a snob when it comes to anything food.. Even food reviews, but felt like I needed to try this place out.. Wow. This place is amazing..\ So ya, if you are ever in Litchfield Park or anywhere in Phoenix area. Try it out"}
{"text":"Hands down, favorite sushi place in AZ! Beautiful area, great service, and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good! They had a roll with flaming hot cheetos inside."}
{"text":"It was ok, nothing great!  Draft beer was warm, and they served my entire order all at the same time.  Needless to say, my 2 warm rolls were cold!  Sad because I just moved to the area and was hoping for a good neighborhood sushi place!  :("}
{"text":"Food was amazing thanks to Ritchard the owner amazing guy. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is just right down the street from our house and I love this place!. The sushi is delicious!! my favorite dishes I would recommend are he caterpillar roll, the dragon roll, Las Vegas is a classic, unagi nigiri eel, also try the tuna very fresh! My boyfriend & I usually order a few rolls and a bowl of the Udon noodle Soup, which can come in a spicy version- very good as well. 

Last time we were here I made the mistake of ordering just \"udon noodles\" instead of saying the udon noodle soup. But it worked out in the end because what our server brought us was so so yummy! It was udon noodle's with your choice of beef or chicken. I personally recommend the beef! it was very flavorful and a great  dish to spilt between 2 people, try it and thank me later!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food. Too much rice in the rolls and not enough fish. Happy hour had decent prices and the owner was nice. Atmosphere is neat and great for a date but definitely not my favorite sushi joint in the valley and probably will not return."}
{"text":"Under new management, now open Mondays, and seems off to a great start! I went there right before I starting transitioning into being vegan, so I won't be back any time soon, but for those of you who still eat sushi, this place is it in the West Valley. Baked lobster roll, lemon roll, and lemongrass coconut sake...you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I sat at the sushi bar and Richard was very engaging. The AZ roll that I ordered was everything I'd hoped. The service for drinks were quick and they were very attentive for a Saturday night. The environment is very industrial, yet urban. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The owner, Richard is so friendly. We tried the fire roll which was incredible, and also a combination of sashimi that was beautifully prepared. I have to say though the best part of our visit was our server Lexi who also happens to be the bartender. She is a breath of fresh air, and she also creates all of the drink specials that are always delicious. I strongly recommend asking for her to serve you when you go in. Good job, Lexi, you're the best server we've ever had."}
{"text":"This place was nice and quiet with great food. I had reservations for 530pm on a Friday. Plenty of seats at the Tim, and the place was pretty much filled up by 630pm. The food was excellent, as well as the service and friendliness of the staff. Highly recommend this restaurant if you want some good sushi!"}
{"text":"Went here awhile back with my mom and daughter and we all thought This place was pretty delicious!!!   Don't remember the names of sushi rolls that We got but I do remember that they tasted yummy!!!  And the service was great.  But the price not so much lol.  BUT I would go back."}
{"text":"Small Japanese restaurant.  Quite hip and clean.  Price was a bit steep for what you get."}
{"text":"Mixed.  Friendly, great location and vibe.  Service could be better.  Spicy tuna and shrimp tempts rolls were small."}
{"text":"Blu is my new favorite sushi restaraunt.  The fish is always superb.  I will concede that the service can be very spotty, even during times when they're not very busy.  If you sit at the sushi bar you shouldn't have any trouble, though.  Ask the sushi chef for recommendations and he'll prepare sushi based on your personal tastes.  Chances are you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I do not know where to begin with my experience with this place , called 2 hours ahead for reservation ...ones we got there it was ok, I adviced tge girl on the fone that my daughter is turning 16 and ask if they can do something special , girl said absolutely we will arrange some for her , so I was very excited , so we got our waitress HEATHER , may I say , I worked many years in the gastronomy and I never ever treated people with so much ignorance , she was from the getco annoyed by us , she brought all our sushi dishes one by one saying that the owner is the only one who makes the sush,kind of weird  when u have a busy restaurant and people have to wait forever for the food , also the pics u see on this page is from the past they look different now , we ordered monkey brain and paid way to much for the size they chop the mushrooms in quarters now and is half of the plate as what the pic looks like on here , when we ordered our last sushi it came an hour later oh and my table had gum on the  floor and when I pointed it out she just said oh sorry , my daughter's surprise was a disgusting green macha ice cream we thought it was good so we ordered a second one but ones we tried it it was nasty so we asked to cancel the order Heather just looked to my kid an exhaled turned around and left , when she came back with the bill it was $167 I left her$ 173  in the plate ...so we got up and left ..now here is the most outrageous thing ...that haffer ...runs after us and claims that we shorten her money ,now it was 3 of us plus a teenager counting the cash we put in the plate 140 in 20s , 2-5 dollar bills and the rest in ones and tip , I am looking at her totally dumb founded , I asked her where the rest of the money was she claims that i gave her only $160 , this dumb itch really try to play us (me) I walked back through the median just to see if might dropped the money , even walked back to restaurant to make sure , we all looked at each other , even the guy who cleaned the table was looking , so I told her to she stole the money , because one thing for sure when it comes to my money I dont play I  know exactly how much I left her and needles to say the 5 dollar bills were missing and 2 twenties she effing pocket the money , her ass needs to get fired , so who ever goes in their watch her ass cuz I am sure won't go back !!"}
{"text":"Took almost an hour for them to get our to go order ready and there was only 1 other table there at the time. Understandable that it would take a little longer because we ordered well done steak, but when we opened it at home, it was barely even cooked to medium!!! Horrible"}
{"text":"30 minute wait for 3 rolls!!!  This is awful.  Manager wasn't even present to to see how the meal was or to resolve any problem.  The wait staff blamed it on a new bartender for the delay on drinks.  Oh and it's the first night. Also for the sushi chef!!!   All she could was apologize.  Finally we gave up and walked out.  Paid for what little we did get!   Normally a good place.  Thought this diamond in the rough was a gem.  Turns out to just a lump of coal!!! Merry Christmas!!! NOT!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, the lemon roll is my absolute favorite. Fantastic environment. Love that we sat at the bar and got to enjoy talking to the sushi chef. Limited wine but the food makes up for the lack of drink menu. Great experience:-)"}
{"text":"We finally did get to come back here and try this place. Service was good, friendly people, not over the top but the food was just okay. The water tasted really bad, like toilet water or something, we ended up grabbing some bottled waters we had in my car and drinking that.We also had a crunchy cali roll which I thought was perfectly fried and super yummy (I'd order it again) and then also a dragon roll, which we get at every sushi place we go to but oh my gosh the dragon roll was DRENCHED in eel sauce. It was way to sweet and really hard to finish (I wouldn't order this again)."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good.  Friendly staff.  We went on a Friday night and waited just over an hour for food.  Will go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The customer service is awesome and the food is great. Andrew is an amazing sushi chef and can create anything you want him to. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I were having a mini staycation @ the Wigwam and the maintenance man suggested Blu for we had a few cocktails at the pool earlier in the day and didn't want to drive.

I try to start every review with 5 stars, this is why Blu only received 3.

We arrived at about 6:30 on a Saturday evening to find only 3 other diners. We were greeted by the hostess who was pleasant and she actually ended up being our waitress. I guess when you only have a hand full of people dining you don't need much wait staff!

We ordered right away. Az Diamondback roll and a Philadelphia roll. Our drinks arrived very quickly but our food, it took forever. It literally took 30 minutes. While waiting we could listen to the reggae music playing loudly in the background, which we found kind of odd. Reggae in a Japanese restaurant!  Waiting so long in an empty restaurant for very common rolls, minus 1 star.

When our food arrived it was presented nicely, but the Diamondback roll was imitation crab..seriously why doesn't it say you aren't getting real crab on the menu? I could have stopped at my local Fry's Marketplace and gotten 12 pieces for $5.95 and not had to wait!  Minus 1 star. 

The Philadelphia roll on the other hand was excellent. The salmon was fresh and flavorful. My only complaint was it had a little too much cream cheese.

Getting the check took just as long as getting our food. My husband finally had to walk over the person who was now standing at the hostess station and ask for our check..I was going to subtract another star but our dining experience was better than 2 stars.

The restaurant and restrooms were clean and everyone was nice so 3 stars it is.

Would I go back...probably not. For the price of our meal I expected a whole lot more from Blu..might explain why the place was still dead at 8:00 when we left."}
