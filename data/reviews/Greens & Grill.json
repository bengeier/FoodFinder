{"text":"Definitely a language barrier here.  I don't speak theirs and they barely speak mine.  I ordered a falafel wrap and asked if it came with fries.  The order taker just shook her head, so I ordered a side.  She kept shaking her head, but I continued to order.  I asked for a soft drink and was told they only have soda and water.  I asked for a \"soda\" and told her I was eating there.  She ran my debit card through her pad, turned it to face me and walked away.  I watched the screen as my payment was processed and figured out that I had to sign with my finger.  Then it started asking  if I wanted to print a receipt.  I pressed \"yes\", but received a printer error.  Then it asked for my email address.  While I was punching it in, the girl came back and cleared the screen.  She asked if I wanted a receipt and then printed it for me.  I then saw that she did not add the side of fries.  I guess the shaking of the head meant that i couldn't have them.  Food came after 15 minutes.  Falafel was wrap dry and wouldn't fit in the little cup of sauce.

The worst part is yet to come.  The girl stocking the salad bar had gloves on, but I saw her go out to the dining area, take a napkin and wipe her nose, then back to stocking the salad bar.  She did not change gloves, or even wash her hands.  Yuck!!  I won't go back."}
{"text":"I was the only customer and it took 20 minutes to get a simple chicken wrap after ordering. After she processed my payment without my signature, she refunded me as credit instead of debit. So I am also double charged until the credit refund processes."}
{"text":"Ummmm wrap in pita bread!! This is a tortilla!
I ordered the spicy chicken kabob wrap and it stated was in pita bread and thats a lie! Overpriced and not good food"}
{"text":"This place was very clean and relativity some what slow, no business. I came into the place before the lunch rush. The cashier yelled out if I had any questions, as she was on the phone taking an order. I continued to review the menu to see what I liked.  Not a single person in the place,  two food handler and cashier, smiled or seemed happy to work there. They were matter of fact no real expressions. I odered a sandwich, panini. The second cook, a young lady, put the sandwich on the grill and proceeded to leave the store ( she did not come back while I was there). She did not say anything to anyone. The sandwich stayed in the grill until the male cook took it out, put it in a box, and handed it to the cashier. The cashier then unceremoniously  called it out handed it to me and said thank you. No express in her voice, as if she had to say this because it was her job. Other customers came into the place and they were treated the same way. I would think twice if I would go in there. I was told by a cashier at Smith's that their cheeseburger was very good, we shall see. To me if you like being around  drones you will like this place. By the way the sandwich I ordered was just OK."}
{"text":"The price is very convenient, and overall the quality of the food is pretty good, but they messed up the order, they brought us a cold burger, they forgot the hummus and there were a hair and a mosquito in the salad."}
{"text":"This place is inconsistent and their customer service is horrible. Only good thing is that it's cheap. But I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh, friendly, and the price is right! A little bit of wholesomeness in sin city"}
{"text":"They have forgotten my order twice already. Even the delivery guy called me to let me know that he was waiting for 15 minutes to call the restaurant and see what was going on. I spoke to the manager who didn't care at all and just said that they had a lot of people.  I mean their customer services are very poor. I do not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Food was good,served hot,great fries,we had the sunny burger,a little messy but o so good."}
{"text":"I love Greens and Grill. Their food is amazing, and always fresh! Will be visiting frequently"}
{"text":"Food is good. But slow. Poorly designed and very unorganized. Even if you order pickup and pay in advance, you have to wait in line behind everyone ordering when you arrive to pick up. Don't try to fit this in on your lunch break!"}
{"text":"I give this lovely establishment a full 5-stars not only because of the great quality and quantity of food given and the cleanliness of the place (front of house was SPOTLESS), but also because of the AWESOME customer service!!  I went in for 1st time today, saw the 9 fried shrimp plate for $6.99, thought it was a great price, and ordered it to go.  The server charged me almost $10.00 and said that the price shown was wrong.  I told her that regardless of the mistake they had to sell it to me for the price as advertised.  She was going to start to debate me over this issue, but instead got the Manager.  I thought to myself:  \"here we go, as usual the customer is going to be wrong\", and was going to leave if they didn't honor the $6.99 price, which I was TOTALLY expecting to do.  Instead, he was VERY nice, VERY accomodating, told me that I was RIGHT, and he honored the advertised price!!   What the--??  I was truly surprised and honored the advertised price, and I ultimately paid about $7.80 for my meal!

The shrimp were cooked right in front of me and given to me hot, fresh, crispy, and perfectly cooked.  The fries, while hot, were not as fresh (but not old), but still pretty tasty.  Their coleslaw needs work because it was bland.  I tried to \"doctor\" it up when I got home to no avail, and ultimately threw it out.  I ordered a side of Ranch Dressing for
$.50 more, and the 1-2 oz cup was only filled halfway, so it wasn't worth the price.

Despite those 2 minor things, I WILL be coming back to try those awrsome looking kabobs!!  I STRONGLY  encourage everyone to check this place out for the food and the service.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place makes my mouth watery. My favorite is the spicy chicken kabob plate. The white sauce that comes with the salad I use for the rice. I get an extra one for salad ;-). They have salads and vegan options. My wife always gets a salad. We love it!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat while my doctors appt was move to 12:30pm, I was really looking for somewhere very close then greens and grill popped on my yelp. I went here and order chicken koubideh and i didn't regret going here for mediterranean food, food taste is really good, staffs are not really that friendly but they're okay with their service. Place is clean too, its well maintain as far as where my eyes can see lol!"}
{"text":"Not sure where my review went so I'll try this again...

This place is super handy for salads. Fresh, crispy and clean, design your own salad.

I would skip the falafel, it's just not that good. Maybe mine was over cooked but it was hard like a hockey puck. Plus it's fried so just skip it.

Warning: this parking lot is a total nightmare on Earth. Go very slow and use your best defensive driving skills. People do not give a shit (like most Vegas drivers) and will ding your car because they don't care about other peoples property.
I have only been here a few times designing my own salad, but the parking lot keeps me away.

They offer a few vegan Annie's organic dressings but they all contain oil. I don't like dressings so I usually opt for just plain balsamic vinegar when they have it, otherwise none.

Customer service is very nice, no complaints."}
{"text":"Greens & Grill is a catchy name-it got me to come and see what they are all about I Got a chance to talk with one of the owners, and very nice people. They've done a great job of opening this restaurant in providing healthy options for people in the Mediterranean style. The place is clean looks like a franchise or corporate restaurant. Very nicely done. I tried the vegan veggie burger, just make sure you tell them no mayo to keep it #Vegan? The Burger Is made from scratch and it was awesome tasting. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Top Notch!  Keep up the good work. Nice people and great food!  It's nice to see healthy options around."}
{"text":"Great place. Randomly stopped in because it looked clean and healthy. Spicy kabob is legit, especially with the cilantro sauce drizzled over it. The salad option is excellent. The chicken and waffle is alright (I like my waffle a little crispier so it's just personal preference). And the price is right."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! Veggie burger  is amazing, everything is homemade and handmade by the chefs. Totally coming back for the a salad they have plenty of options to build your own salad"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant with friendly staff!!! What a great option being so close to the hospital! Will definitely be returning! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I am a giant fan of giant salads, and they're arguably the highlight of G&G. Walk in and see the huge fresh salad bar, with tons of ingredients. 4-topping and 6-topping options are low-priced and include a protein and ample salad dressing from a large variety that includes vegan and low-cal choices. The portion size is good and easily makes a filling meal, note that some toppings like artichoke hearts carry a surcharge.

G&G also stands out with their grill items- the spicy chicken kabob wrap was huge and features juicy, grilled-to-order meat and fresh produce. This doesn't necessarily travel or keep well, so consider ordering it with the sauce on the side to eliminate mess and sogginess.

Location is convenient for me, small but clean and organized, and well staffed. As long as they continue being generous with the portion sizes, I'll continue frequenting them for healthy takeout options."}
{"text":"So good!!! The spicy kabob is amazing and the ground chicken too! Tried the pita today was delish. Very clean and friendly staff, so glad this opened nearby!"}
{"text":"Had a good salad here the other day drove out of my way to get another today and the place is closed. WTF"}
{"text":"I was bummed that you guys were closed today (The Saturday after Thanksgiving) because I was craving one of your salads - but you deserve some time off to spend with your families! Your food is amazing, and I recommend it to all of my friends who try to eat healthy as well. Great salads and ingredients - amazing prices - I'm definitely hooked! I hope you have a fantastic holiday season, and thank you for all of your hard work :)"}
{"text":"Wow, flavors are amazing. The staff is nice. The beef tikks was great.AA++ drinks in wish a little more variety. This is a mix of mediterian and America, and italian. But the flavors are well balanced. Hummus are made fresh and the kabobs are spice and cook in front of you."}
{"text":"Cool small Mediterranean restaurant on Rancho and Charleston. 

They have big kabobs and nice raps, plus a large make your own salad bar. 

Excellent for when you want something different and don't know what."}
{"text":"Been waiting 30 minutes for my wrap. Had to ask about my order and noticed them put my order on the grill. No apology, no refund, no free next time...very disappointed! It took another 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"Awesome establishment! Staff is wonderful, always friendly and courteous. Food is delish  and for a great price! 5 stars for sure, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Veggie burger and fries combo was awesome!!! Caprese was really lack luster though :( and they don't recycle :( but everyone was friendly and the food came out quick"}
{"text":"They are really busy at lunch and the service seems to be disorganized. The place is really small so unless you call in your order ahead of time you will most likely be waiting should to shoulder with other people. I love capreses so I ordered the caprese panini. The panini was cooked perfectly but the balsamic vinegar wasn't high quality and didn't taste great. I probably won't order this again but might give something else a try."}
{"text":"I've eaten 3x here and each time it is the BOMB!  Food is fantastic. Hot & fresh...you can see the steam coming from the rice and kebob  The people is super friendly.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!  I love the atmosphere and hospitality! If you are looking for something new in the area check this spot out! #twiceinoneday"}
{"text":"Make sure to check this place out! This is one of the best dining options if you're looking for something quick and healthy! The Food is fresh and delicious! Staff is extremely friendly! Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat at in the area. I had the beef kebab wrap and it was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is seriously good . The food is fresh made to order and tastes great! I haven't had anything I didn't love ! The beef tastes like perfectly cooked steak and the chicken is tender and juicy. The salad bar looks like an awesome spread. I've even heard good things about the paninis. Try this place !"}
{"text":"Went here and noticed that most of their food you can request as a lettuce wrap.  I ordered the falafel wrap and asked that it be wrapped in lettuce instead of pita.  The lady at the counter said ok.  I guess there was some mis-communication because I had to send it back e times because they didn't understand it.  I finally ended up with a falafel wrap with extra lettuce.  The falafel was good, and pita bread was good, just not what I ordered.  If I come back I now know the falafel wrap cannot be placed in a lettuce wrap :/"}
{"text":"The salad menus is fresh and delicious. So many protein and veggie options as well as dressings. I ordered the jalapeño ranch so good! Staff is really friendly and the place very clean with a calming vibe. Prices are very good for such a healthy option."}
{"text":"My food took over 20 minutes, and it seemed to be because the employees were preparing large orders for postmates and grubhub the whole time. It seems like it would have been easy to fit in a single wrap between the huge orders for people who weren't here yet, but okay. 
Otherwise it was still pretty inexpensive, and tasted good. Just expect to wait a while for your food because even if it doesn't look busy they are probably preparing large orders for people who order online."}
{"text":"Super fresh and delicious. Their veggie kebabs are amazing. The salad bar is enormous with more options than you knew existed. If you are looking for fast food made from scratch, this is the place!!  The hummus and homemade pita is to die for."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meals here BUT I will not return due to their second C grade from the Health Department. Apparently the owner is not aware of the rules and how to maintain a clean operation and not know when to dispose of food with mold. GROSS!

{"text":"This place has phenomenal kabobs! Delicious seasonings and they give you a generous amount of yummy rice and a salad for the side. Had the Veggie Kabob and it tasted great and filled me up. Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"Took a half an hour to get food, 5 people working and maybe two customers already served and eating there. So not busy whatsoever! I ordered sriracha chicken fingers with a side salad and buffalo chicken fingers with fries and one more additional side salad to go. 
I asked before ordering for them to put the fries on the side as I was picking up lunch for my bf to drop of at his work. When the order was finally done they forgot a salad and I had to ask for it and wait while they prepped another one. While they were doing that I checked the rest of my meal and saw that the fingers were on top of the fries! Now it wouldn't have been so bad and I would have accepted the soggy fries drenched in sauce,  but I didn't order the fries for myself but for my bf but my now sriracha fingers ruined them... Already irritated I point out that they put the fingers on top of the fries and even in the wrong meal. They just looked at me with a blank stare, not oh sorry we forgot nothing, they hand me the salad and I ask for ranch. They say they are in there, mind you I have two orders of chicken fingers fries and two salads. They gave me one ranch, a small container. I ask for more, the lady then says she has to charge me. I will never go back because of their lack of customer service. One measly ranch for two salads and two fingers and fries. I ended up giving all the food to my bf and went somewhere else to grab food for myself, you would think a noticeable pregnant women would have gotten decent food service from this place but nopeeee! Never again! I wish I would've paid with my debit card so I could cancel the payment but sadly I used cash. :("}
{"text":"First time and I ordered Chicken Kabob plate (2 kabobs, rice, salad and pita). Only $9.72 out the door. This would go for $15 anywhere else. The chicken was so moist it could be cut with a fork and it was nicely seasoned. The veggies on the salad were so crisp and fresh. The rice was delicious and the pita tasted fresh. I will be back!! This area needed healthy options!!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of healthy options to choose from. My friend and I decided to go here for lunch.  I like the design of the place but not the way you order the food.  My friend ordered a salad, she paid then had to get in a line to have them create the salad.  The place isn't that big for two lines. I would suggest ordering the salad first then pay, to decrease the crowding. Other than that the food was great I ordered a chipotle avocado chicken panini with fries.  I must say both were delicious. My friend enjoyed her food as well. Lunch time is super busy. So I'll try in the afternoon to go here."}
{"text":"Really good tasty food and fast.  I would habe given them 5 starts if the online ordering would have worked. I got there and my order was not ready, but I only waited 5 more minutes for my food."}
{"text":"Great quick and healthy stop on the way to the Smith Center. The staff was attentive and helpful to first timers. Kabobs were delicious and the salad fresh. Classic crunchy fries made those extra calories worth it. Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a million times, as it's right around the corner from my office, but never gave it a shot.  I was craving kabobs today and didn't want to drive far so I checked yelp and there it was!  Ordered through the Eat 24 link for pickup and it was almost ready by the time I got there.  The place was clean, nice staff and great food.  I got the ground beef kabob plate.  Very flavorful, large portion and came with a side salad with their tasty \"white sauce.\" (get your minds out of the gutter...).  Super glad I tried it cause this place will definitely be added into my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment multiple times, usually during the afternoon or evening.

Atmosphere: Modern and \"green\"
The crisp white-colored theme of the restaurant accented by the green decor definitely gives a modern yet healthy vibe to the joint. Definitely makes me want to inquire about their healthier options.

Service: Ok
To be honest they are a little slow on food production for my taste. No smile or welcome upon entering the establishment, but they still take your order when you're ready.

Food: Ok
I've ordered their Mediterranean dishes and their American dishes. Both were ok. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles, but I could tell they used frozen chicken tenders for their chicken: the waffle was pretty good, however. I also had their falafel plate which was pretty tasty. Their strengths definitely lie in the non-American dishes. The American dishes were not priced at a good value but the non-American dishes were definitely worth the price.

Summary: Not bad!
If you're looking for some Mediterranean food, or maybe want a salad or a quick chicken and waffles, stop by this place! They are closed on Sundays, but their food tastes pretty good any other day of the week."}
{"text":"Vegans! This Greens grill has delicious veggie kabobs with a delicious spicy seasoning.  Another go to place to grab delicious plant based meal. Comes with yummy rice and a side salad. Just ask for a vegan dressing"}
{"text":"Perfect place for something fresh and flavorful!! We ordered a salad with their chipotle chicken. It tasted so fresh and delicious. The kabob meat was tender and delicious. The meet complimented the jasmine rice and fresh vegetables beautifully. 

It does get busy around 12 o'clock. It has call in orders. Hashib helped us order when I was unsure of what would be good. 

Their pita and hummus put all others to shame. Love this place. Highly recommend. Clean. Delicious food. Amazing customer service"}
{"text":"Great Kabobs and delicious food! Service is prompt and the staff are all so nice. The food is very reasonably priced and portion size is generous. Great for a quick, healthy lunch in central Las Vegas. Wish there more places like this in our neighborhood!"}

{"text":"What a place! Amazing food and great people! Everything is made fresh. We got hummus, a wrap, chicken/waffles, and a panini! Best food we have had! Can't wait to try the kabobs next time."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Fresh, clean, healthy food. Great service!  I LOVE this place. Many low carb, gluten free, organic options. Great flavor and seasoning. Very reasonable cost too!  So glad they're in this location. Bypass the greasy fast food and eat something real!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this place that offers reasonably healthy food at a reasonable price.  They offer multiple options for salad toppings, several different types of protein, and multiple salad dressings to choose from.  You can even pick the type of greens you want!  Otherwise, I have sampled their steak kabobs - fresh, quality meat, if a tad over seasoned - and their cheeseburger, which was delicious.  I also tried a falafel wrap, but I have to say I've had better falafel; this was grainy like it wasn't fully cooked. 2 days in a row we ordered through Grubhub and things went very well.

Unfortunately, on day 3 after placing our order, Grubhub cancelled our order saying the restaurant was too busy to take our order.  I know Grubhub can be less than accurate in these situations, so we tried again on day 4.  This time, the restaurant heading on Grubhub stated that the business was not accepting online orders but soon would be... then their status changed to \"next available delivery 11 am\".  Their hours of business are supposed to be 11-9 and this was 6pm.  No one answered the phone after 3 calls.  So... I'm split.  The food is great, but if they can't maintain dependable hours then they aren't going to be a viable delivery option for our workplace.  I wish they would at least update their website to address the problem or invest in an answering machine.  Still, if you're in the area stop in.  The salads are phenomenal!

UPDATE - On April 11 I was contacted by a restaurant rep who apologized for the problems and advised that they had gas and grill problems that forced them to stop taking online orders for a period of time.  Those issues have been resolved, so online ordering is back in service.  HOWEVER, it has also come to my attention that the restaurant closed over the same period due to health code violations including improper handling of raw meat.  They received 2 separate C ratings, but have since regained their A rating, so you be the judge."}
{"text":"Greens and grill is one of my new local fav's... food is fresh, cooked to order, friendly, and family owned.  Lots of healthy options if you are looking for that too."}
{"text":"On my favorite neighborhood places list for sure. Different options, healthy, and friendly ambiance."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! And the owners are very friendly! My coworkers and I come here multiple times a week. We tell everyone about this place. Definitely recommend the teriyaki chicken kabob wrap!"}

{"text":"Went here because I was craving fish & chips. The photo looked good. Got there and ordered off the menu on the board. The 2 piece fish & chips under seafood shows that it comes with fried and Cole slaw.  Ordered it for togo and it came out to be $5.99 and a choice or fried or Cole slaw. What??? Pointed out the menu said $4.99 with friends and Cole slaw. They said sorry that's wrong and it an old menu. Got home and the fish was paper thin and didn't taste good at all. Horrible once is enoigh."}

{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends. Tried the chicken kabob plate. With rice. Chicken was good very well, flavorful. Good with the salad & dressing. Rice was ok. Barely ate it which is fine, I was more than full! Price was ok, $9.99. Service was just ok, not bad just ok. I'd come again for sure to try more times!"}
{"text":"I'm very particular when it comes to chicken but I ordered the chicken skewers and they were absolutely delicious and the fries were to die for! The place is very clean and the manager was friendly and knows what he's doing"}
{"text":"This little shop has awesomely good food. The kabobs are flavorful and tender and the rice is very good. The salads are made to order with fresh ingredients. I really like this place and will eat here often."}
{"text":"I decided that after walking by this restaurant so many times when I check my mail, and it was not busy today this is the day to try them. I was pleasantly surprised the store is very inviting and so a great feel about it. The owners are a very wonderful and professional. They also work the grill and cook the food. The soft green that they use in the decor is very appealing too. I am not very excited about the large mirrors that they have since I am superstitious and believe that the mirror can trap your soul. 

Their salad bar is what I ordered and one can order six toppings for $7.99 so that's what I did and selected my own dressing. I went with blue cheese and all of the topics and greens were fresh and absolutely delicious. The guest can chose from mixed greens or spinach or do a combo of them, I did this. The feta cheese was so fresh and so was the broccoli too! It was all cut to perfection and in such bite size pieces.

Since it is my first time here they owner/cook was cooking beef kabob on the grill and the smell just filled the restaurant and I decided to order that as well. Let me tell you I was not disappointed. The beef kabobs are cooked over an open fire and smell oh so delightful, but taste sensational. We had to try the pita bread and I love pita bread and can make it by hand, but do not since it is a pain. Their pita bread is hand made and is very good! If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would. Between the stellar service and absolutely delicious food I found my new favorite restaurant! And it's close to my house, makes it so great!"}
{"text":"Ok let's start with saying that the food here is amazing! I got the sunny side burger with avocado. They did put too many onions on the burger, and the avocado was not ripe. But those are small details, the flavor was there, and the fries are the bomb. They don't have a fountain drink station which did kinda suck, and I went during lunch so there was no place to sit. It is super small in there but the mirror they have on the wall makes it look so much bigger and brighter. They did take a long time to make our food, so if you are hoping to get a fast lunch, this is not your place, Unless you call ahead. They also forgot about my friends meal. And we had to wait for them to make it. But again this business is just getting started so I'm sure they will iron out those details as they go. Will definitely come again, but will order ahead. :)"}
{"text":"Great customer service & I got the chicken kabob and rice with two falafel and it was amazing"}
{"text":"Good food with vegan options. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"A new place that serves paninis, Mediterranean food (kabobs and wraps), and build-your-own salad that seems to be one of the healthier options in this strip mall. 

The interior was immaculate with a very nice, small display of sandwiches along with a large salad bar. My friend and I opted for the caprese panini, which was soggy from I don't know what. Panini's usually come with a crispy, crunchy exterior but this one was floppy for some reason. I wouldn't have even bothered to serve that had I been the cook. 

The falafel plate comes with fries or rice. The fries were the best part of the meal, with the falafel being underwhelming. 

I haven't been able to try their salads but it is a \"build your own\" so there would be some flexibility there. 

Food took quite long to be served considering that there was one other table and plenty workers.  We waited about 30 minutes for the food to be ready. It's newly open, so I figure they still have to work out their kinks. 

I'll give them another shot with their sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food is good but I've had 3 bad experiences.

First time the girl made fun of my ingredients in my salad.

Second time they forgot the dressing. 

The final straw is I ordered pickup and showed up and they hadn't even stared the order I waited 40 minutes for a salad and the same employee who made fun of my salad last time commented on it again today.

And twice I paid for bottled soda and they gave me cans

The service is horrible."}
{"text":"Let me start with how clean this place is. The other restaurants in this plaza are outdated but this place has a new, modern style. The service was fast & employees friendly. The food is excellent! We ordered the kabob plate with rice....SO good!! The salads are huge. The burgers were thick juicy Angus beef & their fries were the best fries I've ever had. I left the best for last. Their GG house white sauce! They make their own yogurt & make some sort of concoctions. I poured it over everything!! So good! The prices are very reasonable. Will def be back."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best salads and kabob wraps I've tried. The turkey burgers are also delicious! Unlike other places, this is one of the fewest places to provide such a wide variety of toppings for your salad. It's also very convenient if you need to just make a quick stop for your lunch break. They work very fast! Very convenient prices and the staff is very friendly, they make you feel right at home. They are very nice and caring for their customers. 

I definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for good Mediterranean/American/Seafood/Greek combinations rolled into one restaurant. Definitely keep coming back for those kabob wraps!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a few more times. Their salad bar is great and placing a pick up order is super easy. Staff is always super friendly and salads are definitely worth the price. The food seems to get better each time I go. Though I did recently order sweet potato fries and they were somehow a mix of burnt and soggy. Here's to hoping they're better next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. The food is amazing. The food is made fresh and right in front of you. Even my wife, being pescatarian, has said the Vegetarian menu is great. We both are set out to try the entire menu. I have been recommending this place to everyone I know.  The entire staff are kind, helpful, polite, and even make suggestion on what to try next. So please go check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}

It's clean, Ingredients are FRESH, very affordable, & friendly service.

I've had several salad combinations..sooo yummy. 

I just tried the Spicy Chicken Kabob Wrap and the portion was generous for $6. It was delicious, my husband and I want to try everything! 

Oh and their special Greens & Grill sauce (GG) goes very well with the wraps. 

I will post pictures next time"}

{"text":"It isn't too often that I stray from what I know is good and reasonably priced. Today I tried Greens & Grill. My tastebuds had a field day with their spicy kabob plate that came with salad, rice and two small pieces of the bread. The bread was so good that I ordered a whole one for $2.50. Well worth it. Maybe they will start adding more bread on their kabob plates after my review. Lol
Anyway, the place is new and very clean all the way to the restroom. The service was impeccable and with smiles on their faces. As I enjoyed my meal I saw other delectable dishes leave the hands of the capable chef. I will definitely be back with friends. I can't keep this place a secret too long. I see a very bright future for GREENS & GRILL."}
{"text":"Made an order inside waited over 25 to 30 minutes for my simple chicken kebab. When I went to the counter to ask the young lady she obviously had forgotten about my order and was just in the process of starting to make it. As I stood at the counter I listen to the manager make personal phone calls in front of customers. When I told the manager she simply stated that she apologized and that next time she would get me a free item. Unfortunately lunch was over so my eight dollar kebab was not to be eaten. Huge customer service fail!!!"}
{"text":"The flavors were amazing and portions MORE than filling. No kids menu options for smaller portions, but the kids still enjoyed their burger and chicken burger. The skinny chicken kabob was tender and plentiful. The price was a little high but that's because I had to order sull size for the kids. Delicious options. I wanted to try the tzatsiki and hummus but the only dipping option was pita bread (I asked for cucumbers but was told no)."}
{"text":"Came here during a quick lunch break with a coworker and ordered the chicken wrap and steak salad. Both were pretty good! The chicken wrap features tender and juicy kabob styled yellow chicken and the portion is big enough to split for lunch and dinner, which I appreciate because it saves money and keeps me relatively satisfied. 

The salad is also pretty good because you can add 4-6 of the toppings which looked fresh when we went. 

The service was a little slow, but perhaps it takes a while to roast the steak and chicken.

They also have a nice selection or dipping sauces and dressings which they are more than happy to package up for you to go. 

 Would definitely come back for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Food is amazing. Prices affordable. And the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Just now am able to get out of bed after being food poisoned from this establishment. I got their salad with spicy chicken and a few hours afterwards violently vomited everything out, and have been bed ridden all day forcing me to call out of work and lose out on money. After googling them, I found they've been given multiple low food grades and have been in dirty dining. Do not, I repeat do not risk getting sick by eating here. Food wasn't even that great, not even remotely worth how sick I am. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Super fresh huge salad, lots of ingredients and types of dressings to choose from, fast and friendly service, clean, great value. I will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Just a few months ago I gave them four stars, raved about the food and mentioned how nice Farhad was to me after I went in person to the restaurant.  I went in again a few weeks later and was pleased.  
     This is an update to my first review. I was in a car accident recently and have not gotten another a car yet, so I have to order delivery from them.  I have ordered twice from Bite Squad, which is who Farhad recommended. 
     After I order, I call the restaurant to tell them that I need the food not spicy (illness reasons, so it's important}.  The delivery is expensive so I order extra for leftovers to avoid the small order fee.  The first delivery last month came with the food so spicy I had to THROW IT ALL AWAY.  I even tried to wash off the spice (YES, washing cooked beef and vegetable kabobs)..  I threw away $40 worth of food (with delivery costs).  I swore never again, but tonight gave it one more chance, 
      I wrote in bold caps on the order, VERY LITTLE SPICE.  Then I called and told the girl who answered at the restaurant that I needed almost no spice.  I also told her I had to throw away the last order due to too much spice.  She said they would be aware and take care of it.  Well, as I write this my tongue is on fire.  I will have to throw away almost $40 worth of food, again.  I may as well of just flushed the money.  NEVER AGAIN.  NEVER! I don't think they care anymore."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were looking for a new health food restaurant and found Greens and Grill on yelp. We walked in and were immediately greeted by several staff members. Staff is very informed on all of the food the restaurant offers, they provide stellar customer service, and answered all of my questions with a friendly demeanor and a smile. I was surprised to see that Greens and Grill have a lot of different food options including kabobs, fish, chicken and waffles, wraps, salads and burgers. I got the Falafel wrap and it took about 10 minutes to come out, but it was fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this place to anybody seeking a healthy food alternative!"}
{"text":"What a terrific place to have lunch. Delicious Kebab's and awesome salad bar choices. Bright and extremely clean atmosphere. Great family run business....stop in and say hello...you'll leave happy and full"}
{"text":"I noticed this place a few weeks ago while picking up some bulk herbs down the way at Stay Healthy! and finally got the chance to stop in for lunch.

Walked in and the line was to the door around 12:15ish this afternoon. It was poppin'- mostly people from the UMC nearby.

I made my own salad with grilled chicken and various fresh veggies. So many options for dressing! Including Annie's vegan and plenty of other gluten free/vegan choices. They even have Bragg's ACV.

In addition to grabbing lunch for myself, I picked up a cheeseburger and an order of chicken and waffles for my +1 for life and a chicken breast kabob wrap with fries for my co-worker. 

Price is AWESOME considering the portion size. The waffles and kebobs are made to order, so there will be about a 15 minute wait. Just a heads up. My co-worker loved her wrap and said it's her new favorite spot by our work. The chicken tenders and waffle looked great. Huge Belgian waffle with big, crispy tenders. Nothing looked soggy. My salad was good too- you can choose from a variety of greens and I liked that. Variety is key.

My one small meh was that the chicken on my salad was cut up pretty small and there wasn't as much as I would have liked."}
{"text":"My gf orderd a custom salad and the lady making the salad put on the wrong dressing and didn't tell her. My gf watched her put the wrong dressing on, then watched her grab the correct dressing and put it back. Probably realizing her mistake. What if my gf was allergic to the dressing? This is unacceptable and dangerous. To top it off, there was a short hair in the salad! I'm glad I didn't order anything. I got frustrated at the long wait time. This restaurant charges an extra 0.99 cents for artichokes. 

It wasn't a good lunch hour"}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthier alternative and this place did not disappoint. The location is small but cozy, the staff is friendly and the food is great. The salad bar has a great amount of toppings to make the perfect salad for you. The 6 topping salad is my go to!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight.. Teriyaki chicken kabob plate was absolutely amazing and the plate was absolutely gorgeous with all the beautiful colors on the plate ..we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant during my stay here with my family and we wanted to try this place out. We ordered the spicy kabob and beef Kabob plates. Both are marinated and grilled perfectly! The rice was also really good. Love the sauces! The place is clean and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Went back for a salad crunched for time and was charged $2 for two small dressings! Ok im done and ill make sure to inform all my nursing friends to avoid this place!"}
{"text":"This is the healthiest best tasting food I've tasted in town. Awesome salad bar, awesome grilled kebabs and great chicken and waffles! Quick service as well."}
{"text":"One of the best place to eat food in vegas. Awsome food n awsome attitude of owner. If you want good service with the tasty food, visit here."}
{"text":"Finally, a healthy eating option in my work neighborhood. I have worked in this area for years and the places to eat are very limited. I was excited when I saw this place would be opening!

I met a fellow Yelper for lunch on Tuesday. When we walked in, I noticed that the place is pretty tiny and seating can be cramped. We both grabbed a paper menu to decide what we would have. The menu is large and offers a little bit of everything but the majority of the food offered is Mediterranean and I have no problem with that. I selected the chicken kabob lunch which was accompanied by basmati rice, side salad, pita bread and a most delicious creamy yogurt sauce created by GG. My friend ordered a loaded vegan salad. Regarding their drink selection, they have a refrigerated cooler with soda, tea, juices and water for you to pick from.

Food came out pretty quick and hot. Everything tasted really fresh and the chicken although it was not on a kebab was extra juicy. The yogurt sauce they provide for you to dip your pita bread in is heavenly. I could have drank a jug of it! Ha! Ha! My friend also really enjoyed her salad and I think I saw every possible vegetable grown in her salad. We both finished happy. 

The service was quick, efficient and friendly. My only reason for three stars versus four is that they serve their lunches in styrofoam containers which for me is a turn off as it is not earth friendly. I would hope they might invest in a recyclable container. Otherwise, I am a fan and will be walking here for lunch quite often! Welcome to the medical district Greens & Grill!! I can't wait I to try more of your offerings!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome food.  I ordered the beef kabob w/ a side salad - VERY fresh meat/ingredients cooked to perfection. 

Best spot in the area for a quick/healthy bite. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant! Not only did we receive the best customer service, the food was hands down amazing! The beef kabobs with the option of lettuce wraps is a must! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"At first it looked like a healthy eating sort of restaurant. Yuck? But actually it was really, really good! And it is pretty healthy as a bonus. 

They have a salad bar with a lot of toppings you can pick from. They had fried fish and sandwiches. They also have kabobs that are marinated really flavorful and cooked to be super juicy and tender, thus the 15 minutes it takes to wait on them. I would suggest calling and ordering ahead if you can't wait. 

The one star off was because they likely use a little MSG, at least for the kabobs, since I always get a little bit of a reaction to it. The service is attentive and good, too. Looks like a family business, maybe."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, it was very good the food is great the workers and owners are nice, the place is very clean, if you're on this shopping center this is the spot to eat at"}
