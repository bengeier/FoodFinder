{"text":"Excellent food, really loved the beef tartar and cod cakes for starters. I had the halibut , my husband had the sirloin;  everything was well balanced and tasty,  portions were perfect. Extremely pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant only one star, because as it is a restaurant the most important thing is the food and the service, not the decorations. We had a reservation at 3 pm, but we were not able to get the table till 4 pm, because the place was not ready!!!...Then we order 3 course food, ( salad- crab- fillet mignon ), because the service was horrible, we had to wait 3 hours to get the fillet mignon plate at 7pm !!!! The restaurant has a horrible shortage of waiters. NOT RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Disappointing and overpriced.  Ambiance: When you walk in, the bar is immediately to your left and is well appointed. The lighting and set up is beautiful. Once you make your way into the restaurant it's rather ordinary and the wow factor is gone. They had a lounge singer belting out old tunes on a wireless mic. throughout the evening which seemed kind of odd. May cater to the older crowd but was a little awkward at best even if he could sing well.  Food: I ordered the feta and cabbage stuffed chicken and what a disappointment. Dry as dirt and I could not find any sign of cabbage or feta anywhere on my plate. Other members of our party had the filet mignon and the porgy (fish) which were apparently good but nothing special. My entree of salmon tartar was good. Ordered a side of fries which were delicious but the portion was tiny for the price.  Service: Attentive and friendly, there is a lot of staff working this place and your wine/water glass is constantly refilled. Our waiter cleared all of the wine glasses even though our wine carafe sitting a few tables over still had at least a glass worth left. Honest mistake.  Price: Way overpriced for what you get. We were 4, with entree, meal, dessert and 2 bottles of wine (about 2.5x SAQ prices) we had a hefty $550 bill including a std. 15% tip.   All in all this place needs some work (food, price)  and we can only hope it gets better with the limited up scale choices in the area."}
{"text":"This place will suffer the same fate as most places in the West Island if it doesn't either reduce its prices or step up its game.  Nothing was bad, but it certainly wasn't high class dining even though it was at a high class price.  The food was generally good, but not exceptional.  Again, for the price, it needs to be a lot better to compete.  The seafood platters are an unholy ripoff.  The cold one consists of one shrimp, a couple oysters, and a half lobster tail, and one lobster claw...for $38. The hot one was mainly octopus and calamari with one lonely scallop and shrimp.  Don't be fooled by the use of plural on the menu, \"scallops\" and \"shrimps\" mean one.    The wine by the glass is just the same sugary stuff you can get at a chain restaurant.  I didn't look at the full wine list so maybe there's a bit of hope there...  The server was very nice and tried hard but, again, was not up to the level of a $35 entree restaurant.  Could barely describe the wine by the glass!"}
{"text":"Ossiano offers a high end dining experience in the West Island. I would best describe it as a steakhouse with a Mediterranean twist. I went to the restaurant for weekday lunch with my wife and were greeted very warmly by the hostess who promptly seated us.  The Table D'hote menu had few choices however was broad enough in scope to satisfy most.  There was no à la carte lunch menu but I believe this is more likely due to  the location of the restaurant, the assumed high cost of rent and the need to keep costs down.  That aside there are plenty of positives to go on about.  As an appetizer I had the salted cod cake, a tasty start. I chose the Bavette steak cooked to a medium rare perfection. The entire staff was extremely attentive and knowledgeable of the menu items. Their bread is absolutely delicious and is freshly made In house.  The desert, chocolate cake, was just ok. My cappuccino was adequate however it was served a few minutes ahead of the cake...tsk, tsk. (Always serve together!)  I look very much forward to returning for an evening dinner in order to dive deeper into the cuisine."}
{"text":"I'm from the west island and I've seen my share of restaurants that have not worked at  location. When you walk in it's an experience they cannot be explained the Decour is phenomenal that staircase is just mind blowing. I took my wife there on our one year anniversary and it's definitely the perfect romantic spot that will just set the mood. I have to admit I was kind of worried that it would be just a good place for looks but I'm telling you with all my experience this place definitely surpassed my expectations  there cuisine was phenomenal. We started off with an Tuna Tartar fantastic!!!!! Then I had a Filet mignon cooked medium rare perfect !!!my wife had the red snapper wow! Then the dessert PHENOMENAL! I rarely write reviews on restaurants but this was a must and it was definitely a restaurant I don't want to lose I'll be back very soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and had a wonderful foodie experience. The homemade grilled shrimp ravioli were delicious, as were the shrimps à la plancha and filet mignon. The filet mignon was perhaps the best we've ever had. However prices are very expensive, you're looking at a bill around $200 for only 2 people (starters, mains, desserts, drinks, taxes, tip). Would definitely recommend and come back but only for a special occasion, as I'm not rich enough to dish out $200 on any regular night at the resto."}
{"text":"An amazing dining experience from start to finish. Service was more than exemplary! Food was some of the finest meals ever served to me in the west-island.   Cod cakes and the grilled octopus was a true delight."}
{"text":"Have been for lunch and dinner. Lunch menu has meals for $21.  The food is really good- highly recommended.  It is a little bit pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"To be fair the venue is beautiful, the staff is friendly, the food is good fresh and fine.  But the price is really to high compared to the quantity. The sea food platter 38$ per person could include 3 more oysters they had 3 little one only, half lobster tail 1 jumbo shrimp Martini is much more expensive if they use grey goose vs. Absolut, but as we saw Greygoose we believed this was the vodka they would use for vodka based drinks, but in fact it would come with a price tag and the bar tender did not explain this difference. Overall, food is very good but very  expensive. I did not like   the tomato salad, tomatoes were not ripe at all nothing there. Deserts were very good and quantity was very good 200$ total for 2, we took 3 martinis, and 2 starters each, 1 desert each. No wine nothing else"}
{"text":"Visited on December 28, 2015.  This restaurant exceeded my expectations.   The food was fresh and of the highest quality.  The wine list offered many decently priced selections.   The service was good but could use  some small improvements.   Definitely worth trying again."}
{"text":"Pour souligner notre succès d' entreprise nous voulions souper dans un excellent restaurant dans l' ouest de l' île. Notre choix s' est arrêté ici. Premièrement comme les restaurants qui ont précédé celui ci, l' accès est difficile. Une fois le restaurant trouvé le stationnement est facile.  Une  fois a l' intérieur le décor nous impressionne. Un grand escalier, des plafonds très hauts ainsi que de magnifiques lustres nous font réaliser que les propriétaires ont mis le paquet pour nous offrir un décor d' un restaurant haut de gamme.   L' accueil fut chaleureux et professionnel. Le service fut aussi très efficace par Nuno qui nous a proposé des apéritifs, des entrées et des plats principaux. La liste des vins est impressionnante avec une vaste sélection d' importations privées. Le sommelier nous a recommandé un excellent vin Portugais. Il avait tout un défi car nous avons choisi du poisson et des grillades.  Les entrées que nous avons partagé furent Les croquettes de morue qui étaient selon nous trop salées, un tartare de buf servi sur une julienne de frites qui était parfait un un tartare de saumon qui était également très frais et bien présenté.  Les trois plats commandés furent un eau pavé de Flétan qui malheureusement avait un léger gout de poisson moins frais, un beau morceau de thon rouge qui fut simplement saisi comme un steak bleu ainsi qu' une énorme collette de porc grillé qui était goûteuse et juteuse.  N' ayant plus d' espace dans nos estomac pour un dessert, nous nous sommes sacrifiés pour une boite de mignardises avec un café. Excellente mignardises mais j' ai été très déçu du café allongé qui était amer et acide. Dommage car a la fin du repas, un mauvais café laisse un mauvais souvenir.  Le restaurant n' est ouvert que depuis moins d' un an. Il sont également ouvert pour le lunch. Je vais certainement y retourner le midi car les prix sont beaucoup plus raisonnable."}
{"text":"I keep on going back to Ossiano! The atmosphere is jovial & the restaurant is one of the most beautiful ones i have ever seen. It's a fine dining resto where you sit & enjoy a variety of food.  I ordered the beet salad which was drizzled with olive oil and my friend had the green salad both were delicious.  We also had the red snapper for two, it was grilled with simple ingredients like lemon,  olive oil & oregano.  It was just delicious!  Desert was suggested by the waiter a white chocolate soufflé with a drizzle of English Cream was ok. I would have liked a faster service & some bread on the table. However,  I had the pleasure of conversing with David the Barman.  Great person with lots of knowledge on wine,  scotch & wiskies.  He made me try few at the  bar.  The overall experience was positive & I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"By far the worst service. We came for a birthday dinner and the hostess asked if we had a reservation, which we did and had confirmed. They stated there was no reservation. The restaurant had one table. Took 20 min to ask for the wine list, some guests wanted cocktails which they did not how to make (Campari spritz). In addition when time came to take our order. They did not have 1/3 of what was on the menu. Ravioli? No. Lamb? No and etc.. waiter went by the bar for the entire duration of our meal. When he had realized that the side orders (fries for certain guests) they came 20 min later. cleared the table 45 min later didn't ask if we wanted to desert and just brought the bill. Which he made mistakes and redid. Three times."}
{"text":"Had a Friday lunch. Went for the table hote. Salad was excellent and the ahi tuna was superb. Service was superb. It's a new restaurant and they are working out the bugs but the decor is fabulous, the bar is very nice (you can just come in for a drink). Excellent for lunch or dinner. Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Half the items on the menu are never available. Ambiance is nice. Service for the high prices you pay was horrible."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the ambiance is amazing. I've been twice and plan on going this weekend... Would definitely recommend to sea food lovers!"}
{"text":"The Spanish octopus was really good. I wish it was a main meal. I was sad when I was done eating it. The waiter recommended the Pork rib and as soon as I took 1 bite I knew I didn't like it. There was no seasoning, it was really blend. I had to ask for some red hot chilli flakes & some steak seasoning and salt and pepper I didn't finish it. I had the cheesecake and it was really good as well. We we're 7 and everyone enjoyed their meal besides the pork rib we we're all satisfied with our choices and enjoyed the evening at the restaurant and there was a lady singing as well we had a good time. I will go back and try the Valenciana meal. Also the white wine Pinot Gris Pfaffenheim & red wime Pinot Noir Belle Glos Winery. There were nice also"}
{"text":"Where do I start??  This was the location of the old Steak&Frite place. And what an amazing job they did. Was like walking into a fairy tale of some sort with the winding staircase, glass wine cellar. Very impressive. Could not help notice the beautiful girls to greet you in. I also noticed live singing but where was the singer?? Finally found him strolling around the tables. Pretty good singer considering I am a singer!!!  We ordered the seafood entree which I think came out to $180??? Thats just crazy. Was not that much and way to sweet for me. I never had sweet seafood before?? unless that american made chinese food. I had a scallop, 1/4 shrimp, 3 inch octopus, 3 rings of squid and that cost $30!!!! Way tooooooo expensive.   Then it took forever to get our meal. We made a complaint. My Bass was pretty good I must say but our friends Veal was over cooked and service somewhat slow to react.   It cost $250 we gave $300 asked for change back to be sure we gave enough tip but it never came back. I actually came home hungry and had a snack.   All 3 couples were unhappy and and do not think they will return. Shame as its a really nice place.  Check out the photos."}
{"text":"I love this place. Went there twice now. Food was delish and beautifully plated each time. Service is one of the best in the west island. Nice decor as well. Lunch special is only $21 for table dhote. Enjoy!"}
