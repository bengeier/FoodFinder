{"text":"The pad see ew was great!! I also ordered the Thai wings (another must) but the fried rice was okay (wouldn't order again). Service was adequate but nothing spectacular. Overall, a decent Thai place!"}
{"text":"We had lunch in this restaurant and there were seven of us. We ordered a bunch of food. Food was not as good as it was when this used to be Pin Kao. We were having fun as we had out of town visitors, we did not pay attention to the bill. We later realized that the pad thai never got served. The receipt they gave us never had the breakdown of what they charged us. 

The lady who waited on us was not friendly at all.  This used to be a very good restaurant when it was Pin Kao."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming under new management. The staff were friendly, eager to please, and very quick with requests given to them. The restaurant was beautifully decorated, with lots of Thai centerpieces. The food is delicious as well as affordable. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We ordered chicken panang, garlic beef and wonton hotpot for our early dinner. The service was excellent and the food was tasty however the servings was too small for its price, there are about 8 tiny little chicken strips on the panang, about 6 pcs of wontons on the hotpot and I kid you not 5 tiny bits of garlic beef and all dishes were mostly filled with veggies. It's a cozy spot with great service but it needs a fair amount of food for its pricing."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, lemon chicken was phenomenal, by far my favorite dish. I always enjoy the panang beef as well!"}
{"text":"Most favorite Thai place!!! We have eaten a lot of Thai around vegas and we are really picky! Siamese bistro is by far the JAM. I have yet to have a dish I didn't like.  My favorites are yellow curry, Pad woon sen shrimp, Pad Thai, and tum yum. Love love love this place. Great for kids too."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai Restaurant in the SW! 
Great service, great food, friendly employees"}
{"text":"I just moved to Las Vegas and I have looked for a good and authentic thai restaurant. I have found a few good ones, but Siamese Bistro tops them all. Restaurant is clean, food is great, service is excellent. I will be coming back here more often."}
{"text":"got the chicken pad thai lunch special 

it was super good and came with a lot of food for 8.50! came with egg roll and wonton and a bowl of soup"}
{"text":"Horrible delivery time! Don't order for delivery! Took over and hour and 20 minutes for a status and all the employee told me when I called was that she didn't see the order so it was on its way. Not what I expected for a restaurant with such high ratings."}
{"text":"Same old place Pin Kao,  descent taste, kinda pricey for a Thai food and they claim New Ownership!"}
{"text":"Red curry lunch special was delicious! My husband asks for orange chicken which was not on the menu and they did make it for us. A little light on the sauce but it was still good"}
{"text":"They changed their name a while back but kept the same menu.
Pros:
Chili mint noodles are the same and delicious 

Cons:
Didn't refill water once (I drank both my husbands and mine since he had Thai tea)
Don't accommodate super spicy request
Sticky rice wasn't cooked right, watery and mushy on the inside and very dry on the top
Papaya salad had a lot of watery liquid 

Too many good Thai places to go back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Your food got no flavors.. we ordered lunch special fried rice,pat Thai and basil beef.  I would never go there again"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, but the reason i am giving it one star is because the food was really bad and the prices are way too HIGH, i am not trowing shade at them, all i am saying is that they should lower their prices down. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I really dont mind paying 45 dollars worth of food, but i at least expect it to be good food."}
{"text":"If you live in the southwest of Vegas, this is a great Thai restaurant. It's not too expensive or cheap neither. It's right in the middle with great prices. I had the steamed Bangkok sea bass, it was so delicious with all the juices. My friend had the fried rice so delicious too. Good flavors here."}
{"text":"Average Thai food, good friendly service; however, a bit pricey @ $94. for two which includes taxes & tip. Fish didn't taste fresh and over cooked. They must have changed chef as food quality is not as good when it was Pin Kao. Place is still nice and clean."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the restaurant itself because I ordered takeout, but I am SO happy to have this yummy Thai spot right by my house. I can make Thai at home for really cheap, but for some reason it's always so pricey to order out. I will say we ordered a ton of food from this spot and fed our family of 4 for around $50, with leftovers. Better price and better food than another big Thai spot down rainbow that I will keep unnamed. I ordered the beef spicy basil and pad Thai and both were super delicious. Thai style egg rolls are always bomb. Also the Tom Kha soup was full of flavor and the broth had the perfect ratio of chili and coconut. We will definitely make this our go to spot to satisfy that craving for spicy Thai!"}
{"text":"This place is so hit and miss. Last time I ordered and I was missing items. Money was refunded with no issues."}
{"text":"Had the pad Thai chicken.  And shrimp papaya with a side of duck eggroll.  Great taste.   Decor is awesome."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot in town. I work right next to a trendy multi location Thai restaurant which gets a lot of unwarranted love. I will gladly drive here once a week to fill my cravings. Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed!! Penang Curry is the best! Rangoons and Jerky also Phenomenal :)"}
{"text":"The service is great but the taste of food are not.  I ordered two  noodle dishes and they were just salty with too much soy sauce. I don't think it's the old chef from previous thai restaurant"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The fried rice did not have any flavor. Got the Kung Pao chicken and it wasn't spicy at all. It looked more like soup. Very disappointing I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow this place was great when it was Pin Kaow. It has gone from one of our favorites to we will never go back or order take out from this place. Last time we ordered take they had recently changed the name to Siamese Bistro but online it was still under Pin Kaow. They have since raised the prices so we asked why was it still under Pin Kaow online with there old prices. After speaking with the manager we were told they will not honor those prices but we still placed the order since the food was so good. Today we placed an order. They charged me for the order then called back and said they didn't have beef teriyaki but we could have store credit or get something else so we got Calamari and Chai Tea. Well the food was not good and we got about 8 pieces of Calamari and the cup they used for the Chai Tea was smashed and the bottom tore off so we had our tea in a plastic bag. We called and were told the driver would not come back so we can get a free Calamari within the next 2 weeks. What a joke seriously after ordering beef salad, yellow chicken curry, broccoli with chicken, pot stickers, Calamari and this Chai Tea spilled into a plastic bag and tipping the guy $5 thats there service to long time customers. Please save your time and money and go to Archie's down the street."}
{"text":"This place is under new ownership and a new name. Food is still as good as ever as well as service! I just wish their wine list was a little more extravagant."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town! If I could I would give them 10/5 stars .  The best Spicy Beef Basil was perfect. The crab rangoons are like none other and the Duck Curry was the best Ive ever had! Thank you for a wonderful Mothers Day dinner!"}
{"text":"Siamese Bistro has been on my bookmarks for ages, based in large part on the fact that their social media promotes one of my favorite hard-to-find Thai dishes: Khao Soi, a curry noodle soup with chicken topped with fried noodles for a beautiful presentation. Planned a group dinner here during the holidays to check the place out with a few friends, most of who are Thai or have been to Thailand. 

Menu items were hit or miss- the soft shell crab and mango salads were both great, refreshing starters but the curries we ordered were on the sweeter side, even when ordering green (which is supposed to be hotter).  
 The Khao Soi that I was so looking forward to was underwhelming, with a bland curry soup base and dry, overcooked chicken. We chose another business in the plaza for dessert.

Service  was not particularly engaging or attentive. We repeatedly had to ask for additional sharing plates/bowls, spoons, etc. All of the diners were seated in adjacent booths along the right wall- out of the entire restaurant space, literally all of the customers were in one area, all right next to each other, which hampered conversation as we didn't want to disturb tables immediately adjacent to us.  Not sure why this was done but it contributed to making our visit less enjoyable."}
{"text":"Two amazing items, panang beef curry and soft shell crab yellow curry! Very impressed! 

Our first time here since there was a change of owner, and it definitely satisfied our craving for delicious Thai food! 

Great service as well! 

We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Only came in for take out but was very impressed with the food and the service. The place is brighter now than before, seems more spacious,  and was very nice and clean. 

We ordered 16 dishes which came to a little over $200 which is pretty decent pricing. Everything came out within 30 minutes, all packed nice and clean. The staff already packed utensils for is and asked is if we needed plates and gave us a whole stack! I've never been offered plates for take out orders before so I was impressed! :) 

The food also tastes very good! The crispy pork and Chinese broccoli had large chunks of crispy pork, very tasty! Curry was also very good, sweet and savory. Everything tasted very good! Will come back to try other items!"}
{"text":"The crab fried rice..... delicious! The calamari was in a sweet and sour sauce which really made it very flavorful. For starters I would definitely recommend the cream cheese shrimp tempura, to die for. The shrimp and scallops in garlic sauce was amazing. It was sprinkled with toasted garlic and in this delicious creamy sauce laying on top of cabbage and broccoli.... what a combination! I'm going to guarantee you'll love the food."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out and delivery multiple times. I always have an issue. It's a shame because the food is good, but the service is not."}
{"text":"Hits the spot for Togo. Seems like the quality never changes after the new owners took over from pin kow. I would have given 5 stars, but seems like the portions are a bit small fro the price & the order comes out wrong once in awhile"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and the food is amazingly tasty and the prices are reasonable. The service was also exceptional."}
{"text":"Nukka was our waiter for the night. He was great! He was attentive and friendly. My girlfriend and I had potstickers, panang curry with fried tofu and chicken pad Thai! The food was delicious! I would so recomendar this place! Also it's so close to where I live so convenient."}
{"text":"I went to this Thai place yesterday, I've been looking for a good Thai place since I've moved to this side of town. I used to go to Thai house off eastern. But thisssssss was so much better. 
I ordered the pork pad thai, spicy basil (ground chicken), and the pot stickers. The potstickers didn't even make it home because my fiancé ate them all in the car. He is so picky but he said they were the best he's had!! 
The pad thai was amazing, seriously so delicious!! And the spicy basil had great flavor, with the right amount of spicy that I usually can handle which is like a 3. 
They were fast and amazing. 
I'm craving the pad thai as we speak, so definitely getting more soon."}
{"text":"We invited our foodie friends to try Siamese Bistro and we were pleasantly surprised. Kitty, our very friendly server gave us good suggestions. The Crying Tiger Beef was the group's favorite. The papaya salad was deliciously crunchy and spicy, balanced by the sweetness of the thai barbeque chicken and pork penang curry. The dessert of fried bananas with coconut ice cream was a nice ending of a most satisfying dinner. Good dinner and wonderful company equals happiness."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. They must've changed their lunch menu. Not happy with their customer service as well. A lil rude and they sort of rush you. Their bbq was so dry and i used to be able to order this with a fried rice, they want you to pay them individual. Wouldn't go back again"}
{"text":"Can't stop. I might have a problem. So good, every time. Chicken pad Thai, fried rice and yellow curry are money. If we can't decide on diner... it's bistro to the rescue."}
{"text":"Nice place and great atmosphere, food was great but not sure if because of language barrier but service was not with a smile or courteous. Made us feel very uncomfortable when we had questions about the menu. A smile would be nice and service is so important"}
{"text":"Husband and I have eaten here several times and enjoyed it the ambiance and decor are cozy. My husband always gets the turkey and I usually get the chicken pineapple rice it's really delicious."}
{"text":"I read all of the reviews and I'm not sure what some of these people are talking about. Today, I called in an order for chicken Tom Kha soup. After reading the reviews I was hoping it wasn't bad. I have to say this was the best Tom Kha soup I've ever had. Pleasantly surprised and highly recommended. I bet the bad reviews on here are from their competitors in the area."}
{"text":"Have been going here before the name change. Food seems to be the same. Usually get the pad-thai along with the spicy basil pork. Tom-kha hotpot is large enough for 3-4 and has great flavor. Haven't had the sit down service in quite some time, but get the food to go."}
{"text":"i live in SW since 6 years and never ever saw that place before!
they have a daily happy hours between 3pm and 6pm 
like usual i ordered more than i can eat but i wanted to try dishes i always order at Archi's Thai bistro.
the restaurant itself is spacious and well decorated.
large selection of dishes.
i ordered the thai chicken wings (excellent), spring rolls (only cabbage and silver noodle in it) great as well.
we ordered pad see ew with beef, thai salad with beef, chicken basil. i wasn't impressed by it. was ok...
I tried, like the happy hours menu :)
but i ati prefer Archi's bistro."}
{"text":"It's ok. It was my first time and usually I like to announce that it's my first time. But when I walked in and told him, he said, \"ok...\" That's it. Thought he would be more welcoming and offer to tell me about specials or something. It was 8:20 pm and I asked what time they closed and he said that the kitchen closes at 8:30 pm. Um...ok. So I ordered pad Thai, crab Rangoons and spicy basil. I took the food home and nothing had spice and it was just ok. I don't think I'll be back any time soon. Maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Thai food so we decided to check Siamese Bistro since we were in the area. The chicken wraps were very good and the two dipping sauces that came with the wraps was very tasty. We ordered pork pad Thai noodles and green curry with chicken. It was more than enough food for 3 people and both dishes were very delicious. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Super affordable. Fantastic service just as good as it was before the name change. Oranges for dessert a great touch. Will be back aga"}
{"text":"Not the best thai restaurant I've tasted. Me and my cousin decided to try another new restaurant and we chose Siamese Thai since it was nearby. It was the worst choice. We went in on Wednesday, January 25, 2016 around 1:30 p.m. and the place was dead.

We ordered a few dishes, they were:
- Beef Jerkey
- Catfish Delight
- Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai
- Chicken and Shrimp Pineapple Fried Rice

We first got the Beef Jerkey. The Beef Jerkey itself was very delicious but the sauce was ok.

Next, we got the Catfish Delight. The Catfish Delight was alright. It wasn't the best nor the worst dish we had. The catfish itself seems it wasn't fried enough and the sauce tasted ok. They didn't add any spice, just plain fried catfish pieces with curry sauce on top of it with vegistables on it and that's all.

Then, we got the Chicken and Shrimp Pineapple Fried Rice. Since my cousin loves shrimp, we ordered this dish. She was looking for shrimp and only found three pieces. Really? Three pieces of shrimp in a fried rice dish. Disappointed. The worse part was that one of the shrimp pieces was bad because it had a weird smell and taste. As for the whole Pineapple Fried Rice dish itself, it tasted alright. It had tons of onions in it and less chicken and shrimp.

Finally, the Chicken Pad Thai came. The dish itself was ok, it didn't taste as good as the other Thai restaurants I've gone to. It just had a little flavor.

As for the service, not the best. The waitress just orders our food, brings out the food, gives us the check, and box our left overs and that's it. They didn't come and ask us how's our meal? Do you need refill for your drink? Or anything like that. We had to wait a few minutes to get one of the waitresses attention since all of them were having lunch.

Overall it was not the best. I recommend to eat somewhere else. They do have lunch specials here but probably taste worse. We ordered the dinner menu and it was costly. We could of eaten somewhere else where it was very delicious and way cheaper than this restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Went for lunch. Nice selection of lunch specials for about $10. Soup was a warm cucumber soup. Never had anything quite like it. Clear broth. Delicate flavor. Quite delicious. Entree was red Panang curry with rice and egg role. Excellent flavors. Portion size was just right for lunch. Good service. Nice spot."}
{"text":"The service was really good and fast.  We didn't have to wait too long for our food and that's great when you're hungry.

Their menu had a lot of good selection and very affordable as well. 

I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is my local go to Thai spot. They will also deliver to me. I have a new thing for mango stickey rice"}
{"text":"Very nice and yummy Thai restaurant in Vegas,I think will come often later on. The good was amazing and fresh shrimp"}
{"text":"There is certainly a lot of space for improvement but I love their salmon green curry so much as it makes up for everything."}
{"text":"I thought this was one of the good Thai places in Vegas. The venue is really nice. They did a good job with the decor and there's plenty is seating for large groups.

I had the spicy basil with ground beef. I thought it was really good. It had great flavors. You can taste the basil which I loved but not overpowering. Most places make their spicy basil salty but this had the right amount of salt.

I also tried their pad Thai. It was really good. You can taste the peanut sauce but not too much of it. 

At first the service was kinda slow but they were really attentive and nice overall. I enjoyed it.

I would recommend this place. Ended up paying about $25 for two entrees for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent phad Thai and good service. They can be iffy on cold appetizers in past but flavors have always been good and  lunch specials make it a must try if you haven't  been here before. If I could give 3 1/2 stars it would be solid. Trying the Thai salad this time."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on Christmas Eve. First,  the staff was friendly including our server. We proceeded to order the tom yum, Chinese broccoli and beef, seafood surprise, and the pad Thai. Everything was delicious. Fresh, flavorful and light. The only thing that was a downer was the pad Thai. It just tastes a bit gummy and the flavor was a bit off compared to other pad thai's I've had. Overall, the restaurant was satisfying enough that I would come back. Come check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"These reviews..tge good ones must be based on the past when it was pin kao becauae it's not the same...food quality is terrible.  Really sad because it was our go to thai food eatery as we live nearby...now we are driving miles to find decent thai food.  Not sure if it's no longer thai..not sure what it us..just not good.   :("}
{"text":"My third time is as many months. The first visit was based on yelp reviews and the food was quite good. The second time it was mediocre but I thought I chose the wrong dishes. The third time it was essentially inedible. We only took one bite out of each dish and left the restaurant. There was an overwhelming amount of salt and garlic. They insisted that there was no MSG in the food but it tasted like MSG and I already have a headache and a dry mouth after just 2 bites. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Was in the area and was told about this restaurant. I always enjoy Thai food and decided to try. I asked what the chef's special dishes were and I tried the beef jerky, crab fried rice and stuffed shrimp. Everything was tasty and well prepared. 

The interior is very nicely decorated giving a classy and romantic Thai ambiance."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants. Close to my house so it's very convenient. Great service!"}
{"text":"I have to say their food is number one in town but their customer service is absolutely bad 
Thank you have me the menu so you can go there and sit which what I did it was fine it took them about 25 minutes come over and serve water and whatever else we want it I ordered soup they didn't give us the actual spoon to start having the soup I got up and went to the counter and ask for one school she came back to me with horrible face attitude it took her time to figure out how she acts she is the manager probably the owner I didn't like it 
Bad service 
Well that's gonna be my last time.........."}
{"text":"Came here on a wim and wanted to try their lunch special. It seem very authentic Thai. The decor seem really authentic and a feel of Thailand. 
Food was good. Will be back"}
{"text":"Based on area Thai restaurants in the area, this place has great tasting Thai food, good portions as it relates to price. I had an excellent experience with customer service. If it continues, I'll definitely update to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My 2 kids and I waited at least 15 minutes to 20 min to order. We had to waive someone down. There was only one other table in the restaurant. When we finally got 1 or 3 server's attention. We asked if we can order the mongolian beef with only green onions & white onions (instead of all the bell peppers that it cooked with). Server said \"no, can not change\". I told her but onions cost less than bell peppers...and asked if she could ask the chef's if they could do it. She continued to shake her head and said no, we cant change. So we ordered it anyway....and i cant tell you how tough the beef was and absolutely did NOT taste like mongolian flavor (not because it was cooked w/bell peppers)...the flavors were highly lacking. The whole dish looked light and grey. WORST dish I've ever had! Even my kids were like...is this mongolian beef? I also ordered the basil chicken...it was a tiny portion and it wasn't good. 

Service continued to be next to nothing as we had to flag down someone to get to go boxes and the check. Mind you there is STILL ONLY 2 TABLES IN THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT (we counted as one of them).

On a scale of 0-10 (0 being the worst)
Taste: 0
Service: negative 1000000000
Portion: 1
Price: 1
Cleanliness: 2 (bathroom smelled like sewage/eggs....not just a little....i mean it was thick in the air!)

I will never be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai food and being new to the area (temporarily) I just had to find me a good Thai spot nearby. My girl friend recommended this place to me since we have the same taste buds for Thai and spice levels and I loved it!!! 

Service needs just a tad bit of work.. as soon as we walked in there were no workers available or anywhere to be found so we just seated ourselves. Sat there for a bit until a worker finally noticed us and provided us a menu.. once we were noticed the service was great (besides the fact that they mixed our spice levels up on our dishes) and we were constantly checked on.

We ordered:
-Thai papaya salad, spicy 5 (received a spicy 8)-- bomb and it was actually the perfect spice so I'm kinda glad I was given the wrong spice level here lol.
-Yellow chicken curry, spicy 8 (received a spicy 5)-- this was really good but could've been spicier. My girlfriend had to order more spice on the side. 
-Shrimp fried rice, no spice-- this was for my god daughter and she loved it. 

Portions are pretty decent sized and I have no complaints on the taste of the food. I'll definitely be back whenever I need to get my Thai food fix!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write any reviews, mainly because I forget, but this place used to be under an old owner, and now it's under a new owner with a slightly different menu, but the food is more amazing! We had split a seafood soup on a hot pot and the broth was extremely hot and delicious. The fish was tender, and the dressing for the salad was tasty with a slight peanut and herb taste."}
{"text":"Really good. It's under new management I think it used to be pin kaow. Very delicious we love the yellow curry and pas Thai!"}
{"text":"Since new management has taken over I was hesitant on trying this and since Archie's doesn't deliver I decided to try this place due to the reviews. I loved Pin Kaow! I ordered My favorite Panang curry with tofu and was very disappointed. Some of the tofu was burned. I chose spice level 8. It was very soupy and lacked flavor or much spice. I don't think I will try this place again. My son ordered the tofu soup and liked it."}
{"text":"Great place, great service and DELICIOUS food!  This place is one of my favorite thai restaurants.  I've been coming for over a year and it's always great."}
{"text":"This place is a good regular little spot. Nothing over the top. Plates are decent for the price. Food taste decent. Calling in orders to pick up or delivery is always easy with a short wait times. Their Pad Thai is my favorite dish here so far."}
{"text":"I always enjoy getting food here. Friendly professional service. Love getting the lunch special. Great food for a good price. It's easily turning into my one of favorite Thai Spots."}
{"text":"Just moved to this area of the valley and was craving some good spicy Thai!
Pros: 
1) Online menu with prices
2) Can order online for #$3.00 charge
3) Friendly customer service- on the phone and when I picked up my order
4) Fast/reliable service- Gave me 15-20 minutes and it was ready when I arrived 20 minutes later.
5) Spring rolls were a lot larger than I was anticipating! You get 4
6) Massaman Curry was delicious (not too salty) and I was able to get it sans meat. Came with Jasmine rice, potatoes and onions. Ample serving size. I was able to have some for lunch the next day :)
7) Convenience: Directly across the street from my house!
8) Prices were very comparable. 

Cons:
1) I was hoping it would be a little more spicy. I ordered the 8/10, but I found myself noticing it wasn't that hot. Probably is me...I will try a 9 next time!"}
{"text":"I always get the same thing and it never fails. The masaman curry is to die for as well as the fried rice the combination is fierce!"}
{"text":"When this place was Pin Kaow it was pretty good. Now however it may be some of the worst Thai food in town. They claim to be using the same recipes, if that is true the application of those recipes is certainly not the same. Curries are bland and thicker than they used to be. I received a nearly raw shrimp in my soup. Chicken is tough and stringy. And the rice is over cooked and gummy. How does a Thai restaurant screw rice up????  If you want good Thai, go to Archie's, Benjurong or Pin Kaow, if you want something to ruin your day come here."}
{"text":"A few of my coworkers and I went here for lunch and were very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the red curry lunch special w/ a spicy level of 5 and it was delicious! Their soup of the day was cucumber soup, yes that's right, CUCUMBER soup! It was different, but good. I had their Thai iced coffee and it was soooo yummy. The server was very nice, but they had a really hard time organizing and doing several checks at once."}
{"text":"Used to be Pin Kow Thai.  Still amazing food and great service!  Same chefs they say and it tastes great!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely upset over our service today. Wish I got the servers name but omg I have never been disrespected. She was so rude to us, I'm embarrassed because I recommended this place to my family from California to come here and we got this service. Sucks because my husband and I would always order takeout from here. But after today we are never coming back and making sure our friends stay far away from this place. Sucks that the cooks do good but the servers ruin their business."}
{"text":"Terrible flavor and extremely dry meat, everything was either too sour or too salty or no flavor at all. Waitress was extrmeley rude, she spilled our soup and walked away and when we asked for napkins to wipe it she tossed them to us without a care. This place may be convenient if youre looking for a decent priced thai restaurant to eat terrible food then this is the place! They offer a 10% discount for a positive yelp review."}
{"text":"Great food.....we go all the time....best Thai food.....their beef jerky and pumpkin curry is off the hook"}
{"text":"We had pad kee mao shrimp and duck curry.

The pad kee mao was good but a bit salty to my taste. The noodles were well cooked. I find the lettuce in the noodles were a bit odd but it was still tasty.

The duck curry had bamboos, pineapple and mint leavea and let me tell you it tasted SO GOOD !!! With rice, if was perfect !

The thai tea maybe slow down on the condensed milk because it was a bit too sweet.

But overall, affordable and good portion. Worth to try !"}
{"text":"First time here, but definitely not my last! 

The crab rangoons were amazing. And lots of them!  For dinner I had the shrimp pad Thai, and it was delicious.  Some of the best I've had. And dessert... Omg... Fried bananas with coconut ice cream.. There are few things better in this world than these fried bananas!! Amazing! 

The staff was really friendly, the place is very clean, and the service was great and fast!  Highly recommended it!"}
{"text":"The chicken pad thai and spring rolls is delicious."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am so so happy to finally find a Thai Resturant on this side of town that I'm satisfied with  

The resturant was very cute & quiet, but totally not a bad thing. We actually got to talk during dinner without being Interupted by loud music in the background. 

The food was great. I ordered my usual yellow curry, pad se eww and Thai BBQ Chicken. The yellow curry was the perfect spice! I'm a fan of SPICY Thai food and when I said spicy I mean I like it spicy & they hit the spot. The Pad se eww was great, it wasn't dry or to salty! Last the BBQ Chicken is my husbands new go toooo. The chicken actually came on a sizzling plate. The chicken was so juicy and delicious.

I'm very happy with this place & will definetly become a usual."}
{"text":"I have to say we were excited to go here its close to our house and we love thai, unfortunately this was not very good thai food.  My wife got Kung pao chicken it smelled like wet dog food.  The shrimp in my dish was very chewy and fishy smelling.  I won't be recommending this place to my friend and will not be returning.  I hope your experience is better than ours."}
{"text":"Superb dishes! Everytime I come here is always a pleasant experience. I would definitely come here again soon to taste the spicy basil and other dishes. I would highly recommend trying this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my go to spots since it's so close to the house. I read a couple yelpers saying the name changed but not the menu and food. I don't think that is the case at all. I've been eating pad see ew from here for years but this did not taste anywhere near the same. The chicken was either poor quality or over cooked. There was almost no eggs in it even though I ordered and paid for extra egg. The broccolini was literally all stems and super hard. I almost never write bad reviews but what was once poppin pin kow is now Siamese boo Boo bistro. :("}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars but the Pineapple Chicken Fried Rice was not good and very dry. There was hardly any meat and no pineapple at all. I'm not sure if they gave us a different type of fried rice or just forgot the pineapple. 

The yellow curry and spring rolls however were very very good. I would def try this place again. 

We ordered from Amazon Restaurants and the service was great."}

Oh what a beautiful spot.  The outside sign looks like a pub more than a bistro.  The inside has that WOW factor.  But I didn't come here for the wall décor or to taste their design sense.  The décor was super nice.  The bench area was beautiful... But I wanted to EAT!!! 

I was hangry and expected some good stuff especially for all the yelp reviews.  I wanted Jenni Pho but was forced to come here.  The waitress was very pushy and was rushing us.  The place was empty - WHY ARE YOU ALL OVER ME LADY?! But we finally ordered.  We got the BBQ chicken which I think was as big as a pigeon.  For the price of $14.95 I expected a bigger piece.  I felt like we had to fight for the small pieces.  Also, the chicken was overcooked and dry.  Then we got the Crying Tiger Beef - Oh I was crying... because there was not enough beef for two people.  It was enough for a baby bear.  I was highly disappointed with the flavor.  We asked for medium and we got medium well.  GRRRR.  The plus was the beef soup.  it was the cheapest and the heartiest but there was only 1 1/2 beef ball in it.  I mean COME ON guys! We asked for the menu to be left and the lady asked for it back in the middle of the meal.  I mean come on lady, what if we wanted dessert? Ever asked if we even wanted sweets? I guess you don't want us to spend here.  I heard they changed their name.  They should have changed the chef instead.  I heard the food this time was worst.  I am super disappointed with this beautiful location.  I will not be coming back.  I would try it anyway if you want to spend money.  But for the prices there are other locations you can throw your money in.

{"text":"This place used to be called pin kaow but I guess they changed the name since they're under new management. 

My family and I have been here a couple of times after the change. I can say that quality did go down from what it used to be. Some of the workers aren't very pleasant, especially upon entrance. They say welcome in such a bored & harsh tone, like it's a burden you came in or something lol. But there's definitely workers that are pleasant! I guess that's how it is at every establishment, right? Idk. Lol anyway, service is okay. 

Some of the dishes we ordered: 

- deep fried tofu: I give this dish 4/5. Im glad that this is still a good option. You don't feel too guilty eating this lol. It's obviously not the best for your health since it's fried butttt it's tofu! So best of both worlds. 

- shrimp pad Thai: 2.5/5 we ordered to have the spice level at a 5 & there was absolutely no kick. Granted the scale goes up to 10... but a 5 should be medium. Also, the noodles didn't seem cooked all the way. 

- catfish curry: 4/5 this was probably my favorite dish of the night. We also ordered this at a spicy level 5. Definitely didn't have the kick either but the flavor was good so I guess it's okay."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Sunday evening and was surprised to find a fairly large and nicely decorated restaurant close to empty on a Sunday evening.  New owners took over this location in late August, renaming the former Pin Kaow, but retaining both the chef and servers. The restaurant first came up on my radar when I checked under new restaurants on restaurant.com We started with an order of shrimp rolls that were crisp, but largely devoid of shrimp.  For entrees we shared orders of spicy basil shrimp and catfish. The catfish was not at all crispy while the spicy basil shrimp proved to be just okay."}
{"text":"Recently bought out by new owner but the food is still amazing. The restaurant is so beautifully decorated with authentic Thai ornaments, paintings, statues. It's always a pleasant, quiet and cosy dining experience. 

The Pad Thai and Pad See Ew are one of the best I've tried in Vegas. Service is always impeccable. Nuk was an amazing server! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Good food. We come often. Favorite dish is the shrimp pad Thai and pad see ew. Just tried and enjoyed the sea bass for the first time."}
{"text":"Delicious Food! I look forward to ordering from them again. 

After a long day of running errands all over the city, we were looking forward to ordering some take out. This restaurant has been on our list for a little while and luckily I had a menu in my car. I called and placed my order ahead of time and picked up the food on our home. The lady was nice and repeated the order back to me to make sure they had everything right. She also told me the total before the call ended, which is nice because not everyone does that.

The food was really good. We ordered the Pork Pad Thai and Spicy Basil. I highly recommend both. 

I can't wait to order from them again and try some other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"Very Good Food The Service On The Other Hand Not So .We Felt Very Rushed When I'm Eating I Like To Be Left Alone . They Just need Too Make Sure Your Drinks Are Full And Not Be So Pushing"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from Siamese bistro looking to scratch that Thai-food itch and was sadly disappointed.

The Panang curry had no peppers or \"normal\" Panang curry trimmings... just curry-broth and green beans. So weird. Also the curry kind of had a sour taste to it and it was sooooooooo salty. Without rice to camouflage the saltiness this would be inedible.

The Massaman curry also really, really, really salty.

The silver noodles were decent, not very flavorful, but we still ate them.

The crab rangoons ~ always the star of the show. Cream cheese, imitation crab, wonton-ed and deep fried? Yes please. These gut busters were great, my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"Don't know how they got any good reviews. The chicken tasted spoiled. All 3 of us that got chicken were sick the next day. After only 1 bit of chicken, I just ate the green curry sauce and rice. It was the day after Christmas, so maybe they didn't get fresh chicken for a while. Still, they shouldn't make us pay for really bad food. They did offer to replace the food, but that doesn't make any sense. If their food is bad, why would I want more?"}
{"text":"If the dish were just fruits and vegetables it's tasty. If it's something that they have to cook, not so much. The duck curry was good. The Rad Na was ok. I was really looking forward to the mango sticky rice but the sticky rice could have been heated up a little more or should be softer. The spicy beef basil was bland and not like any spicy beef basil I ever had tasted before. The duck egg rolls was ok. The tiger tear beef salad was kind of bland."}
{"text":"This restaurant's chefs do not know how to flavor their thai cuisine.  My papaya and glass noodle salad tasted like dessert!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I can't seem to get away from ordering pad Thai when I go here. It is one of the best I've had in town! I normally order for pick up and it's always hot and delicious! Plus they have great customer service!"}
{"text":"Food was delish! Chicken Larb was good!! And beef ball noodle soup was dead on! It tasted great & not sweet like pho! We definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Such a good service! I always order for delivery or to go and they keep the food warm for the entrees and the ice creams are kept cold. I love their fried banana ice cream! I will surely go back here and highly suggest this restaurant. Great service they give to customers!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here today. Wow! Amazing food and great service. We ordered the Duck Curry, Crab Fried Rice and Chicken Tom Yum Soup. All are excellent in taste, price and portion. We'll definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The only reason I did not rate them with a 5 star is due to the service. Unfortunately, it is not consistent when I go there. I prefer to order takeout for that reason, my boyfriend and I have been one of maybe three other tables in there and would not get things we asked for and also in a slow manner. As for the food however, it is the best curry & Tom Yum soup I have EVER had and I give it a two thumbs up! I do think though that they should spice it up a bit when you ask them for an 8-10...mine isn't usually as spicy as I would like but the flavor is impeccable. Great job with the food quality and presentation, I hope that the next time I am brave enough to eat inside that the service is better."}
{"text":"The new owner ship hasn't changed the excellency of this place . We come here often and will continue . The atmosphere is calming and makes for a perfect Date night . The staff are also very nice"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very good food. I would recommend to anyone. The place is so nicely decorated and cozy."}
{"text":"Great food and polite service, this place is a at great location with the atmosphere inside to being orderly and cozy. They take walk in orders or by phone and they definitely did their best to help me out with making decisions on my order."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the beef soup but with silver noodles, loved it and highly recommend it, you can add the flake peppers from the spice rack to gIve it a kick...$8 and I'm full!! Also had the sauté chicken on skews... it has a nice mild sweet taste and is served with a peanut sauce on the side.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The sign says new ownership but same cooks or something. The food is totally not the same anymore. Everything I ordered was below average, the price seemed higher than what I remember, portions are smaller too. My son ordered chicken satay and they served it raw. Sent it back, they gave it back over cooked. Curry was  watered down and very salty with only about five pieces of meat.  For the price I could have gone to the one on Jones. Sad but will never go back."}
{"text":"This spot used to be owned by pin kaow restaurant. Its been many years since I been here, now it's called Siamese bistro. I walked in this place and it looks the same as before. The male server is very nice, and always helpful to us. BUT the old lady server was rude. I don't think a woman whose limping should be serving food in my opinion. All we asked for was a spoon with our soup and she gave a disgusting attitude about it. I feel really bad for the male server that works there for her. You deserve better. 

Now for the food, everything is SALTY ! The Tom yum soup was drenched in a gallon of salt. The lemon grass trout taste just fine. The pad Thai was okay. This place would've been good, if their food was right and management was polite. Then they would've became a very busy dine in."}
{"text":"Pros: 
1. Fast service. It took them only 10 minutes to get my orders ready. 
2. 10 mins away from my house

Cons:
1. Not recommend the service. 
Called in for a to-go order. The lady on the phone asked for my phone number and told me that my name (and my phone #) was not on the restaurant's system. She told me to call other locations since they have 3. I told her that this location was near my house and that I wanted to order and pick up from here. She, then again, told me to call others. I had to repeatedly tell her that this was my first time ordering here so she won't see my name on the system.

2. The foods are not Thai authentic. 
Ordered Pad Thai and Chili Mint Fried Rice. There were missing ingredients that made up Pad Thai, including peanuts and slices of lemon (that supposed to squeeze in). Pad Thai was oily and less tasteful."}
{"text":"First time there, got takeout...ordered yellow curry w steamed tofu & pad thai w shrimp.  Got home to find the shrimp was barely cooked, it was still translucent!  The yellow curry was very tasty, but only has potatoes...it really could've used some vegetables added, perhaps some carrots, zucchini. I got it w steamed tofu and it was all just too yellow, really needed some color!  The portion sizes lacked for the $27 we spent. 

I called and spoke w Joy about the shrimp problem, she was very nice and apologetic. She said I could return at a later date for a pad Thai shrimp replacement, which I did several days later.  Even though Joy didn't request it, I brought back what was left of the dish to show the uncooked shrimp.  Joy wasn't there, but the woman I gave the food to started counting the shrimp! She said \"there's 5 here, we give 8\", I couldn't believe it! I said we threw out the ones that made it on our plates.  Her response should've been \"We're so sorry we gave you obviously uncooked shrimp!\", that's the only acceptable response.  When they brought the replacement meal out, it was almost insulting how they made a big deal to uncover it saying the cook wanted to make sure I was happy with it. I simply said \"yes, I'm happy when my food is cooked\".  It was as if I was not believed the shrimp was uncooked, even though I gave them the raw shrimp back.  That was last month.

Today I craved some yellow curry. I called and believe I got the same woman who counts shrimp. She's hard to understand. I asked for yellow curry, vegetarian. Pretty sure she said they could put broccoli and carrots and I asked if there would be any extra charge. She said no. I asked for tofu, she said that's $2 more. Then she said the broccoli and carrots would be $2 also. So this little dish was now about $15, all because I wanted a green vegetable. I was annoyed, guess they must not want customers.  I told her to forget it.  Too bad, this place is close by.  I'll be looking for another Thai place."}
{"text":"Good place to come and grab a bite! As I walked in the entire staff was warm and welcoming. We were seated very quickly and approached by our server right away. We ordered a variety of foods in which you can determine the spice level of each dish which was pretty cool! The server took very good care of us clearing us after each course and kept our beverages full! Food was average nothing too special! Definitely would come back for the hospitality we received."}
{"text":"I've been really turned off by this restaurant since the change of ownership/name change, but today the service was too horrible to not say anything. 

We have been ordering take out here for a very long time, and the food has been good. They have ALWAYS been able to accommodate slight tweaks and special requests (both before and after the change over). It's always to leave the meat out of a dish and make it vegetarian.

Today when I called to place a pick up order, I was told that my usual request would not be accommodated. After she checked with a coworker she said they'd do it for a hefty up charge. Uhm, what?

The request was to simply leave the meat out of the dish and add more cashews and raisins that the dish already comes with. The girl taking the order was so rude about it, acted like she didn't need or want my business, and kept saying cashews are very expensive. Really? Not as much as leaving the meat out, I'm sure! 

Needless to say, we will not be coming here again. When businesses make it clear that they don't care about their customers, especially repeat customers, believe them. 

After this incident, I called up Benjarong Thai restaurant, ordered and got ZERO problems when ordering and I was definitely not upcharged either. They had it ready in 10 minutes and was a huge portion and delicious."}
{"text":"The best Tom-Kha that I have had in Las Vegas! Their red curry and duck curry are excellent as well. My first time here and I was just simply delighted. I will definitely come back again. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai restaurant use to be pin kaow but was recently purchased so the name changed. Menu is basically the same. Food is great and also taste the same. If you were a fan of the last restaurant you'll for sure love this place."}
{"text":"Siamese was excellent! This is our first time here We went with my family and we ordered a variety of dishes. All of the dishes were very tasteful. They had just the right amount of spice. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Prices were reasonable with large servings. We all left full and happy"}
