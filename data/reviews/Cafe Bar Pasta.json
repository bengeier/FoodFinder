{"text":"Looked promising at first glance, but horrible in the end. Dry meatballs. Clueless sommelier. Filled with people from Woodbridge. Very strange for a place on the Dundas strip. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday earlier this week. The food was delicious. We tried several dishes and my favourites were the lobster lollipops, the Creste Rigate (loved the crispy duck skin) and the Citrus Pot De Crème for dessert. 

The decor of the place is lovely. We had a large group so we were seated in the back room, next to the open kitchen and were able to talk to Chef Jay who is very accommodating and explained each dish to us as it came out. Over all it was a great experience and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! The atmosphere was quite nice and the restaurant looked beautiful and clean!

On a tuesday night, the place was nearly empty. We sat at the communal table and placed our order after the owner explained the whole menu to us. It did take some time but it was nice to know the way the restaurant approached their food, where some of it was sourced, and how it was prepared.

We ordered the escolar tataki, the brussel sprouts, the bucatini carbonara, and the tagliatelle bolognese. The escolar was a good looking dish and it was nice to try a fish we haven't had before. The brussel sprouts was easily the highlight of the night! Well portioned dish for the two of us with great flavour and seasoning, highly recommended!

Between the bread that is served with your meal and the actual appetizers, we were already starting to get full. When the two pasta dishes came out, we were floored by how large the portion sizes were. Easily, we could have shared a single pasta dish between two people and would still likely have leftovers. The portions are completely wrong and we did not expect this at all! We barely ate half of each of our respective pastas and had to take the rest home with us. Although this can be good for people that are extremely hungry, it is unfortunate that the pasta gets cold once you are about 1/3 of the way through your dish because of how large the portion is.

In addition to the large portion sizes, we were surprised that the seasoning on the tagliatelle was off. It was pretty obvious that it did not have enough salt. The bucatini carbonara was not bad but the dish was supposed to come with guanciale (I was excited to try it out as my one of my favourite dishes in Toronto is Enoteca Sociale's bucatini, so I wanted to compare) but instead, I was served a carbonara with pancetta. I was only informed of this when the owner brought both of our dishes to the table. At the very least, I expected to be notified of this just after I placed by order or during my order at which point I could have had the option to switch. Apparently, the guinciale did not come in that morning and they had to use pancetta instead for my dish. This did not sit right with us and it was definitely not the way this should have been handled.

Overall, our experience at Cafe Bar Pasta was not bad. It is nowhere near the worst meal we have had but at the same time, it is likely not somewhere that we would return to. The brussel sprouts appetizer was fantastic and definitely a highlight dish but the rest of the meal is easily forgettable as the portions were wrong, the seasoning was off in the carbonara, and an ingredient was replaced in my bucatini once it arrived at the table. 

It sits as a low 3/5 stars for us after the meal."}
{"text":"Cafe Bar Pasta is located just at Dundas and dufferin, in a welcoming little space. Just as the name would lead you to believe, their modus operandi are coffees, pastas, and drinks. 

Wine:
While they have many bottles of wine (many stored in a cellar spelling out \"WINE\"), more interestingly is they have many wines on tap (yes, ON TAP). Tapped straight from the barrel, the wines were all easy drinking and complimented the food well.

Appetizers:
Two Tartar - citrus, frisee, puffed caper ostrich, grainy mustard, toasted walnut, wild boar crisp. A must order for tartar lovers! Very well done.

Pastas:
Bucatini Amatriciana. - These were thick chewy noodles with a hollow center which really helped that spicy marinara thoroughly enrobe the pasta. The spaghetti lover in me was completely satisfied.

Rigatoni - shredded duck leg, five spice corn creme, chanterelle A nice sweetness from the corn, crunch from the crispy duck, and a slight dash of cinnamon. In a way it felt like Thanksgiving with every bite!

Ravioli - braised short rib, white truffle, bone marrow, parsley, burnt orange
The most savory of the four pasta dishes we had that night, the Ravioli is rich in all flavour profiles. The duck filling is well seasoned and complimented by an equally flavourful orange sauce. While not my favourite of the night, it definitely had its merits.

Tagliatelle Cabonara - While it wasn't a hard hit of flavours like the first 3 pasta dishes, I actually enjoyed it the most. Simple, yet creamy and tasty!

Desserts:
Cheese Danish with Berries - Can't go wrong with cheese and flaky pastry!

White Chocolate Pumpkin Cheesecake - This is a lighter cheesecake in terms of both density and flavour. Not too heavy a pumpkin flavour, and with the cinnamon and caramel its enough to make it taste like fall.

Salted Caramel Chocolate Truffles - A gooey rich confection with a hint of a sea salt. These truffles are normally served complimentary alongside their wide selection of coffees and espressos.


Overall, I had an enjoyable experience at Cafe Bar Pasta, and would not hesitate to come back for their fresh made pastas and wide selection of wines. A great little spot! :)"}
{"text":"After reading some reviews, I decided to cross the city to Cafe Bar Pasta for my birthday.
Everything was AMAZING. I'll definitely be going back.

The bread and olive oil/balsamic was delicious. Super fluffy fresh baked bread with a flaky crust and a really earthy dark olive oil. I wish this bread had been less tasty, because I definitely filled up on bread (oops).

Hubby and I split the beef tartar as an app. It was delicious. He's more of a meat eater and absolutely loved it.

Hubby got the gnocchi, I got the carbonara. I'd give a slight edge to the gnocchi, but both were delicious. I was worried about portion size after reading one previous review, but I couldn't even finish half of my carbonara! I got the second half packed up take home (and then forgot it there, so I definitely need to go back now!).

We then moved on to dessert, which we split since we were both full. They had one dessert option (I assume it changes pretty much daily). It was a white chocolate bread pudding with dark chocolate chunks and rosemary. Delicious."}
{"text":"Went to cafe bar pasta this past weekend for my boyfriends birthday and it was incredible! Service was probably the best we've ever experienced and the food was great. The apps in particular were the best. Try the cheese board, Brussel sprouts and kale salad. We will definitely be going back soon. The owner really knows what he's doing."}
{"text":"Went here for the brunch today. Delicious! I had steak and eggs. A fresh take on a hearty classic. Cilantro, spicy peppers, Zest! And the owner came by and gave us free homemade churro style donuts. And to top it off I, ran into my aunt and uncle. Great ice coffee too!"}
{"text":"Happened upon Cafe Pasta Bar on Saturday night after learning that every restaurant on Ossington had 1 + hour waits.  This ended up working out incredibly well for us because this restaurant was AMAZING.
At first, our thoughts were: Italian, blah, more of the same.

But the interesting menu quickly showed us how wrong we were.

My two friends and I shared grilled octopus and bone marrow as a starter.  The octopus was served cold and marinated in balsamic and sesame.  It was perfectly flavoured and so tender.

For mains, we had the branzino which practically melted in my mouth, grilled ravioli (delicious!) and a pasta with meatballs and a rich tomato sauce.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  Serving portions were just right (maybe a bit more ravioli would have been nice but only because it was so good...)

They have wine \"on tap\" which includes a great selection from Prince Edward County and Niagara - prices are reasonable.

The service was great: attentive, knowledgeable, prompt and she offered us more bread. 

I don't know if I've ever given 5 stars on Yelp before - this place deserves every one!"}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Bar Pasta on a Friday night and what an amazing time.  A++ ambiance with a great and funky music selection.  We started off with a tasty bottle of red ( Can't remember which one but it's wine so.....smart move) but it was amazing and went well with everything we had and went down pretty quickly...do you blame us?  

We started with the Steak Tartar and the flavours were silly good (like shut the front door good).  We then had this plater (anti-pesto ish) and the unique blends of flavours on this plate was amazing.  From Duck prosciutto to their home made smoked bacon (aghhhhhh you had me at smoked bacon) and even their cheese selection (i'm not a fan of blue cheese but I ate the whole thing, so it had to be nothing short of friggin tasty).  

We then had the Gnocchi with pulled pork ( yes, shut up...with pulled pork).  Let's say there was no doggy bag needed for this one.  

The service was amazing, almost homley.  They took the time to explain the dishes and gave us some back story, which was great to know.   Everything is done in-house or most of it, which is great.  

I'll prob be spending more of my paycheques on this place in the near future.  If I only bought apple stocks in the 80's I would buy this place and move it into my kitchen (I invested in rock pets instead :("}
{"text":"Great local restaurant for a casual but high quality meal. Had the carbonara (amazing), gnocchi (yummy non-traditional recipe), kale caesar (well balanced) and grilled branzino (simple and fresh). Really liked the vibe - \"Stay and enjoy your meal!\" kind of attitude. The owner is very friendly which adds to the local flare. It's nice to have a place nearby with great food and welcoming staff. The coffee was fabulous. Definitely going back for brunch/breakfast, even just for the coffee."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The Brussel sprouts were a must try! And the bucatini carbonara would make any italian proud."}
{"text":"The attention to detail is second to none. Pasta perfection and a wine list by master sommelier. Happily a regular and the owner and his family are lovely."}
{"text":"As the name says, Cafe Pasta Bar has several pasta dishes but don't expect the ordinary. Unusual pasta types and sauces are the norm even though you can find classics such as amatriciana. The menu is small (as it should).  It has an appetizer session, a first and a second course sessions. They also had a dessert menu but we were so full by the end of the meal that we could not even try it.

We shared the trio of ceviches (salvadorian, peruvian, and mexican). We loved how fresh the fish was and our favourite was the mexican ceviche. We also shared the arancini with ricotta. The arancini was very good but I felt that it could take a bit more of salt. I really appreciated the size of the arancini as sometimes arancinis can be very big and challenging to eat.

For the main I had the ossobuco ravioli with a cauliflower and cheddar sauce. I was really happy with my main. Delicious!

The selection of the wine was done by one of the owners who is also a sommelier and I was pleased with my two options, the sauvignon blanc and the shiraz. 

The service was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable of their menu and the wine options. That shows how good of a job the restaurateurs are doing. We told our waitress that we wanted to pace our meal and therefore we ordered one item at time. She was nice enough to bring us some fantastic bread from time to time with sicilian olive oil. We did not feel that we're being rushed at any time. Two thumbs up!

The ambiance is very modern. White walls, red art work, magazines hanged on the wall as a decoration piece. A majestic light fixture anchoring the communal table at the entrance of the restaurant made of silverware is probably the dream of any foodie. For the ones who enjoy working outside of the office, they have several electrical outlets that you can use to power your laptop while having a latte and a scone in the middle of the afternoon.

I recommend Cafe Bar Pasta. It has passed the test. Good food, ambiance, and service. I will come back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an outstanding meal on a Friday night, no troubles getting a rezzo unlike so many \"trendy\" spots in T.O. that don't give you the time of day... 
anyway, decor is fabulous, Chef's table is a really awesome addition as well.... private dining space downstairs as well looked incedible, wasn't in use on our night there but still looked amazing.  

FOOD was superb- deer tartare in lieu of the regular steak tartare on their menu was so so good despite my trepidation of ordering poor Bambi .... all their meat is super sustainable and supports local farmers so that is tres cool.  Loved love LOVED the lamb bolognese . Lobster ravioli done in a  pureed parsnip sauce with crispy parsnips was amazing as well... We enjoyed the Octopus app as well although I'm not a major fan of octopus to begin with so wasn't my favourite. Can't wait to return to try more and also attend a chef collab night ! 

DRINKS: really enjoyed the rose for the wine \"on tap\" .... very nice wine menu. As for cocktails, Togorashi sour YUM ! Also loved the Pumpkin Old Fashioned ! 

SERVICE was outstanding. Any questions were no issue at all ... explained to us the entire menu and was super patient. Owner Tom is incredibly accomodating and very hands-on in the restaurant . We also got to meet the chef...AWESOME overall ! :)"}
{"text":"I was here for my sister's birthday and it was a huge disappointment. Firstly, they were out of bread in the middle of dinner service. An italian restaurant was out of bread. Serious deal breaker. Second, my sister ordered the ravioli as her main, without an appetizer, and the waiter didn't think to let her know that the dish consisted of only 4 ravioli on a wooden board. All of our other pasta dishes were full servings. Her meal was not enough to be considered a dinner and she left hungry. It was more like something you would get on a tasting menu. The food quality was not bad, but the experience was ruined by these two service issues. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Not too sure why my previous review was taken down  but I love this restaurant!

Have been here a few times and recently came here for my birthday dinner with friends. We sat at the chefs table which was amazing for a small group of 10. The owners knew it was my birthday and had written \"Happy Birthday Jessica\" on the chalkboard at our table - a small gesture but shows how much they care about their patrons. The food is absolutely delicious and such a great price. They have a great wine list, and even have wine on tap - could it get any better?!?

The atmosphere is great - cozy but not claustrophobic, warm and unpretentious and they always have great music playing in the background!

Highly recommended and I continue to recommend to others when they ask \"Do you know a great restaurant?\""}
{"text":"It's a cozy spot with one of the best chef tables in the city. It's intimate and cozy with some superb design elements. But what makes Cafe Bar Pasta special is the host, Tom and Chef Jay who seem to have this rhythm and connection. 

The feeling they convey is \" Let me take care of you \". The food has a slight Asian edge to it but the core is Italian with classics like Puttanesca, Saltimbocca, gnocchi and table side carbonara. 

They have a great private dining space down below that can accompany a larger group of people. 

The wine list needs some editing but it has wines by the keg and some of the best local choices. 

So go to Dundas West and let Tom take care of you."}
{"text":"First you learn the rules very well. Then you bend them, shape them, manipulate them and never lose your balance, your sense of proportion. You create a style that is your own, that is recognizable in a crowded community. Put three of these like-minded folks together, and you have the magic that is Tom Bielecki's Toronto restaurant, Café Bar Pasta.

Café
Free form red plexi glass stenciled by world-renowned New York artist, Jose Ortega, wisps along the walls in abstract interpretation of café, bar and pasta. The white brick interior looks like an artist spent days making a kind of broken brick installation.

Bar
\"Vodka is the lazy man's spirit, because it's just so easy to use\", says bar manager Sean Radzio. He likes more of a challenge to make us something we can't get anywhere else.\"I'll make you a cocktail, you put your faith in me, and if you don't like it, then I'll make you a vodka cocktail\". I order a Mustard Tiger: Dijon mustard, lemon juice, tequila Tromba, and cherry liqueur. It is so well balanced, that while I taste every ingredient, none are overpowering, and all blend into a unique and fun elixir. Wine consultant, John Szabo, always creates a well-crafted wine menu with varieties we don't see elsewhere. Ontario wines from Prince Edward County to Beamsville and Niagara, as well as wines from Hungary, Greece, Portugal and Georgia, enable a diversity of pairing options, and include six wines on tap.

Pasta
A cake-y focaccia with shallots, rosemary and chili needs no oil or vinegar, because it is so tasty on its own. Every dish here has multiple flavours and textures. Duck and frisee salad comes with frozen grapes and a creamy sharp cheese that, all together enable a refreshing and elevated medley of flavours, temperatures and textures. This lends itself to a glass of wine. A very generous elk Osso buco is accompanied by crisp rapini and creamy marrow rissoto with a sprinkling of raisins for sweetness. Succulent fish with sunchoke puree is delicate and enhanced by an essence of horseradish; and the little candy cane beets are so perfectly roasted with their green husks on them. I just eat the whole thing. Simply delicious. Much care is taken with every element on the plate.

There is nothing in the world that satisfies like a bowl of fresh pasta. Drizzled with olive oil and lemon, and accessorized with black olives, capers and roasted garlic, this is a fresh garden of ingredients elevated by panko crumbs that give a delicate crunch for added texture and dimension. Everything is lovingly presented--the dishes are so beautiful--and the pasta is made fresh in-house. In fact, we can order pasta to go. Look at the menu; choose any type of pasta like agnolotti or bucatini; and they will have it freshly made for us to take home. Gluten free is also available upon request.

Menus change. For Chef Jay Scaife the kitchen is his culinary lab of invention. Successive visits have seduced us with gnocchi and crisp pork belly; tableside carbonara; five spiced-duck egg pasta; a meaty branzino and crab cake; and we do not dare leave without a decadent mouthful of flourless chocolate torte with caramel, coconut ganache and chili espresso ice cream!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and the food is incredible. Chef is innovative and makes some stellar dishes. He elevates every dish he puts out with personal and unique touches. The mixologist makes some insane cocktails as well that compliments the menu. The interior is beautiful and the atmosphere is always buzzing. The bar also doubles as a cafe as well so you can sit out by the front window which opens up on to the street for people watching. I recommend reserving the chef's table for a date. What up. #jeetzus"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very inviting atmosphere!
Great new spot for some casual authentic dining."}
{"text":"The food here isn't what you would expect.  It was really bland, lacking flavor. I tried 3 of my friend's dishes and all tasted very plain. The red wine was also very cold, and there Isn't a wine list - there are random wines every night, so not a lot of choice.  

The atmosphere was fantastic and the servers are very knowledgable. Hopefully they spice up the menu soon to match the decor and service."}
{"text":"One of the most popular place in Toronto is located in the heart of Dundas West neighbourhood and the restaurant is specialized on the Italian cuisine, although they call themselves the \"Non-Italian-Italian Place\".

Their amazing pasta tastes like Italy and their meals with meat, salads and desserts are all absolutely delicious. I have never been disappointed, whatever I've ordered. 

It's hard to pick one thing I've liked the most, but my favorites are steak with home made fries and veggies, any kind of pasta and beignets for dessert. The wine selection is just perfect, too.

The service is friendly, yet professional, the music is nice but not too loud and it's suitable for a bigger group as well, what is a big plus. 5 stars from me are well deserved!"}
{"text":"Best Italian in town, creative menu, fresh pasta, great service.

I've never been let down.

-thx"}
{"text":"Service was OK, nothing outstanding. Waiter didn't really know the wine list although we ended up with a nice bottle of white. Kale Caesar was good, not sure Kale was necessary, anchovies a nice touch. Sweetbreads were nice but again nothing outstanding. Amatriciana (my favourite dish in the whole world) was completely underwhelming and tasted more of ketchup then tomato. Was slightly disappointed that they didnt remove the item from the bill after receiving my feedback. Would never return and would not reccomend. Campagnolo is much much much much better as is enoteca and a whole smattering of restaurants on college.  Also, when is the whole trend of explaining the dish going to end? its a bloody salad, i read the menu, i dont need nor care where you sourced the kale from.

On a final note, considering this place is as some reviewers have said \"the best in toronto\" we walked in at 730pm (on a thursday) and the restaurant was empty, we were literally the only ones inside. It did fill up later through our meal."}
