{"text":"We were extremely underwhelmed by Mora, especially since this is a celebrity chef's restaurant. First, our hostess told us she was going to give us a great table, which we did not request by the way, she just decided to say that. We are then seated at a tiny table in between two larger tables. Nothing about this table was special or great... which is totally fine, unless you were led to expect otherwise. The people sitting near us were very loud, probably to talk over the really loud music so there was nothing romantic or nice about our experience. The food was nothing to write home about so it shocks me that Scott Conant judges other people's food for a living (and so harshly). There was so much hype about this place but nothing really stood out other than how overpriced it was. We really wanted it to be a place to take friends and family, but honestly, we don't have any urge to go back anytime soon. Like another reviewer said, we so wanted this to be awesome, but it really wasn't so much."}
{"text":"Been in twice already! Have had the same waiter David both times, hes super nice! My husband complained that it was too dark but it wasn't a deal breaker. For 2 drinks, 2 antipasti, 2 entrees ANDDDDDD 2 deserts it was about $100 before tip. Not bad at all. The pork and veal meatballs are a MUST. Can not wait to be back again! Such a great place!"}
{"text":"Great vibe! Good food! And we can bike home. SO glad to have a place we can enjoy so much so close to home!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience-Scarpetta has been my favorite restaurant for years now and I couldn't wait for Mora to open up out here in Phoenix . Everything we got was delicious. The staff was extremely  pleasant and friendly and  I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu ."}
{"text":"We made reservations over a week ago. We eat out frequently. We showed up and they attempt to give us a table outdoors (it is in the high 90s today). I say we don't want to sit in the hot. The tell us they thought we would (this is not standard protocol at any AZ restaurant when it is hot). Then they tell us we will have to wait 20 minutes- we say fine- the manager overhears the conversation and attempts to tell us it is nice outside. We are still waiting for a table. Terrible service. All they had to do was say, sorry, we made a mistake can we buy you a drink while you wait? Poor service at the hostess and management level."}
{"text":"Pretty good place I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there mainly because of the pricing but nice if you want a swankier meal for the evening. 

Brussel sprouts and octopus were quite tasty. Ricotta & marscapone gnudi was also yummy. The lobster in it really added to its flavor. 

Good place overall."}
{"text":"The restaurant has only been open 5 days and it shows the infancy.  Ordered two pasta dishes and they both came out very cold.  I was also
Very disappointed in the inconsistent service.  That said I will be back and give them a second chance"}
{"text":"Hello, If the food and service are awesome I didn't get to find out. I would give a no Star review if possible. My issue is with the Valet service but restaurants need to take responsibility for the companies they use also. I was going to dinner with some friends on Saturday and we chose Mora Italian rest. It was my first time there around 9;15pm. When I pulled in my friends went in to see if we could get in because it was still very busy but we figured we could because it was late, but not sure (maybe should have called a head but we weren't sure where we wanted to eat). As I waited for a 10 seconds a young valet just went off on me for no reason, I was very nice and tried to explain out my window I was waiting and where could I move to make sure I wasn't in the way and if we could get in I would let them park my car. He just kept going off and calling me names, I finally responded by asking him if he was having a bad day. He then pulled a car nose to nose to mine, I thought he was nuts, I pulled off to the side and asked the other valet where I could pull up and wait a few second, that valet was cool. The very aggressive (valet) came back to my window very threatening and that point I had no interest in going in or eating any more. But, I wanted to pull off to the side street and see if he and I could work out our difference. I'm glad he didn't come and I'm glad I didn't give them my car to park. I passed on dinner with my friends because I wasn't in the mood anymore. I'm a very easy going person and I'm still surprised that this happened. I'm going to let my wallet do the talking from now on and I'm never tipping them if they park my car (anywhere) or I'll just park my own car (Go Green Valet). I eat out a few times a week and use valets. It hit me later that he must have thought I was an Uber driver and had issues with them but that still doesn't make it right how he behaved. I feel bad writing this review because of one bad or good employee having a bad day, that should not reflect on the company or restaurant, but it ruined my night that's for sure and others should be aware."}
{"text":"Went with some family this past Saturday. If you intend on going to this place in the near future, make sure to make a reservation as it will be packed -- then again, you probably shouldn't expect anything less from the restaurant of a celebrity chef. My only complaint is that it took quite a long time to get our orders in (though I can't blame them -- again, packed) but everything after that was fantastic. 

If you're going with a large group as we did, you'll want to get a couple of appetizers to split with the table as the portions for each are fairly small (and trust me, by the time these babies hit the table you'll want to try a bit of everything). The bread cart, albeit a bit overpriced for what it is, is worth it if only for the spread. The polenta was easily the creamiest I've ever had and enhanced by the seasonal mushrooms. However, I'll have to say that my favorite of the night was the grilled octopus: tender and flavorful. 

As with the appetizers, I did get the opportunity to try a couple of  entrees. The soppressata pizza was quite good, with a satisfying snap on the crust. I also tried the ricotta and mascarpone gnudi which was rich and filling despite the small portion size. My favorite out of the bunch was the cavatelli with duck ragu, and it's the reason why I intend on coming back to this place. Perfect balance of tender meat and sauce, complimenting the homemade pasta which, in my opinion, was the real star of the show. 

We figured that since we were already deep down into the rabbit hole we might as well get some dessert, the end result of which was an apple crostata and the salted caramel budino ordered for the table. These were the recommendation of the waitress (she informed us that the coconut cake was their not-so-popular menu item) and neither disappointed. 

Overall great experience with some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten. If it's in your price range and you live in the Phoenix metro area, you're doing yourself a disservice by not checking this place out."}
{"text":"Get here!!
Amazing menu, atmosphere, staff, bar and Scott Conant rocks it out with his attention to detail.
The food is so creative you'll want to plan to come back ASAP!!
Enjoy this place Phoenix!!
Thank you Scott"}
{"text":"We dined here a couple of weeks ago. We sat at the bar because the wait for a table was too long. It was a Saturday night and we didn't have reservation, so we were happy to sit at the bar. 

The atmosphere was great. The drinks were expensive and the food varied  from great to weird to bad. 

The great; the fois gras and chicken liver pate was off the charts awesomely good.
The weird; Peas & Guanciale and poached egg. I don' think I'll ever that order that again. 
The bad; The Seafood pizza was disarmingly bad. The crust was soggy, the seafood was over cooked and the greens on top were bitter and overbearing. Yuch...."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I REALLY wanted to love this place. I had been looking forward to our Saturday night dinner reservation all week after hearing the all the buzz and reading the reviews. The food was okay, but nothing like what I was expecting. I love Italian food and was super excited to try the bread cart, polenta and fettuccini. The bread and sauces were just bland, the polenta was pretty good but a little too thick IMO, and the fettuccini was honestly just average. My boyfriend and I were so disappointed as we were so excited to try this new hot spot. Also, the service wasn't the best. Our waitress was a little slow and didn't seem excited or happy at all- and didn't offer any insight into menu recommendations. When she finally did say something to us, she was complaining about the table next to us and how they kept sending their food back. Not exactly the experience I was hoping for. Hopefully this place can work out whatever new restaurant kinks they're experiencing. We'll be back in a few months to see if anything has improved. I'd say it's worth trying if you want to experience the restaurant as the atmosphere was nice, but food isn't anything to get excited about. Really hope it gets better over the next few months."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for a date night or place to meet friends. Atmosphere is great with a really cool vibe and decor. Our waiter was excellent and had so much enthusiasm for the menu selections I wanted to try everything!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying what a wonderful and cool space this is. Unfortunately, for us, the food was just okay. Portions are exceptionally small so we ate everything on our plates, and had plenty of room for dessert. There were 4 of us and we all tried something different so we had an opportunity to sample each others' selections. We had heard from multiple friends and acquaintances about the excellent food, so our expectations might have been a bit set a bit high. Being from Chicago, we have been searching for an old-time Italian restaurant with homemade pasta (check), big flavors (no, more subtle), and large enough portions for leftovers (not even close). Not sure we will be back as we continue our search, but we're glad we tried it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful meal New Year's evening at the Mora. It was our second visit and much better than the first. The dishes were executed perfectly and our waitress was fabulous. Our first visit was mediocre and our waiter was uninformed and attentive. Upon this visit our martinis were made perfectly!  My husband started with the pumpkin soup, it was rich in flavor and absolutely delicious. We also enjoyed the pasta with the Strozzopreti pasta with lamb Ragu and the Torchio pasta with the Bolognese sauce along with the amazing Brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Restaurant was in full swing when we arrived for our 730 pm reservation on Saturday night.  We were a few minutes early; the hostess greeted is warmly and seated us immediately.  Waitress came by shortly after for drink orders and to tell us about the menu.  Service was great.  We ordered the octopus and pearl onion side dishes to start, which were both superb.  For the main dishes, we tried 3 pastas: the pomodoro, the duck ragu and the gnudi.  The pomodoro was by far the best dish,  it was simple perfection.  I was a disappointed by the duck ragu; it was dry and came out cold.  I don't  think it would have liked it even if it had come out hot.  The gnudi was surprisingly good.  It is very heavy, so it might be a good thing to share with your table instead of making it your meal.  The one HUGE negative for us was how loud the music was.  Unnecessarily loud,  it's a restaurant, not a nightclub."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very sexy chic..... The service was amazing and the uniforms are very classy.... We loved our pasta dishes and the bread table ... My favorite dish was the fettuccine and the desert Carmel salt bodini ...."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty much second rate. Barbera d' Alba with undisclosed vintage on list  was a raw 2016 for $54. It was probably a $8 wholesale bottle, The food was really poor. Greasy chicken dish with so many poorly roasted vegs that you couldn't find the chicken. $17 Octopus that was possibly 3ozs of just okay tasting octo. Bibb caesar was very good. Pork chop over salted. Honestly, given the silly hype, they deserve one star. And, I can tell that this is the norm. Apparently this fellow is on TV, but and maybe he can cook, but his chefs cannot."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Italian food in all of phoenix, hands down! Went in a Friday and even got to meet Scott Conant the chef!"}
{"text":"Went out last night for a celebration dinner with my significant other and decided to try out Mora after a few friend recommendations. The night started off on a bit of a sour note having waited ten minutes to get our drink order taken, I had received the wrong drink. The server then came over five minutes after and I got the correct drink ordered and delivered promptly. So in twenty minutes we just got our drinks and no food ordered yet, the drinks were good though however. The server then asked if we wanted some food to start with our drinks so we ordered an appetizer and our main courses. We expected that it would be coursed out by how the server worded it, but all the food came out at the same time in a very quick amount of time. The food was delicious but not the \"best I ever had\" that my friends had hinted at. Practically immediately after our plates were clean they were swooped away and a desert menu was brought to us. We decided to pass due to the non satisfactory feel of the evening, and finished our night elsewhere for some light fare and drinks. I would recommend people to try this place, but to wait a few months. I feel there are some kinks that need to be worked out. The night felt very rushed despite the initial twenty minute lag for drinks. The total time we were there was a mere forty minutes! The couple next to us were there before us and still there after us, and from the look of it, their pace of service was much more normal. Some inconsistencies just need to be worked out and this could be a top tier restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, as was the wine list.  On the latter point, our server was very knowledgeable and could advise on some of the less common varietals.  That is, when we could hear her over the absurdly loud music.  Twice she needed to ask someone in our party to repeat an order, and I (age 35, fine hearing) struggled to maintain conversation without raising my voice.  It's sad to see such a good restaurant commit an unforced error like deafening music.  The good news is that it's easy to correct.  When they do, I will likely return."}
{"text":"I have never left a Yelp review in my life, but I feel the need to express how bad the service was at MORA Italian. Our party had great food, yes. But then we waited for over an hour to receive our check with no service for that entire hour. We were there to celebrate a birthday and that hour was the difference between a great night and an awful night. To top it off, the server and manager could not be bothered to give our table our checks even though FOUR members of our party spoke to them about the issue. The manager, Lance, took down the information to call the mother of the birthday girl in order to \"get (me) a gift certificate\" today, but no call has been received. I do not believe they cared at all about service or our experience there which is a shame to the owners and anyone who prides themselves on doing a good job. Needless to say, I will not ever go back there and I will be giving my honest opinion of this encounter to anyone who asks. Sorry owner guy, your server/manager blew it. Good food though. I do not want anything from this review other than to express just how astounded I am at the lack of care taken by this restaurant's management and to hope they can figure it out."}
{"text":"Some of the food was delicious like seared scallops with sun chokes. (Although for $38 for 3 medium scallops overpriced).  The pine nut vinagrette with it was delicious but scallops unevenly coked and bland.  The Fritto misto disappointing.  No sauce for dipping and very under seasoned.   We were told by staff that there being no sauce was a frequent complaint. (Even the owner's sister).  Also me personally I don't think Battered french fries don't belong in a dish like this.  (Unless you are trying to make it look like a lot of food with cheap potatoes which this accomplished).  There are other veggies with more flavor.   And I am sorry but a crostada is not cooked bland cake like dough with a scoop of ice cream on top and on the plate around it some small dices of apple and Quince.  I only knew what they were because it said so on the menu not because they were recognizable in appearance or flavor.  If your selling a crostada make a crostada.  But I love the atmosphere.   Warm, welcoming."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food. Service was sub-par. Waitress could not answer any questions about the dishes on the menu. She did not know what ingredients were in dishes and I was asking because of some food allergies. Was not offered a refill on coffee until I asked for it. On the other hand our water was refilled without asking. Tables were close together and when someone sat at the next table I had to move over so they could get into their seat. Not good for conversation because you can hear your neighbors on both sides. Very noisy environment with the floors, walls and ceilings they have. I might go back to try some other dishes because we did like what we had but I would not allow them to sit me in the section with the same server. Prices are kind of expensive for the portions you get. I had a veal chop and my husband had a pasta dish with sausage.  Disappointed that bread did not come with the meal at these prices. Most Italian restaurants give you Italian bread. I expected it to be better than it was."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday. I had high hopes for this place, as it was recommended by my sister-in-law. The ambiance was great and I really liked the decor. The pomodoro was pretty good. Not the best red sauce on earth as touted by our server, but I may be biased because I think my Italian grandma's sauce can't be beat. Nevertheless, it was pretty good and the pasta was very fresh. My husband's steak was good. It had good flavor and was tender. What I was not happy with at all were the meatballs. What I received was nothing like what was described on the menu or other pics that were posted. I was served 2 tiny meatballs in a red sauce for $12. Also, the service was mediocre at best. I will probably not be returning and would not be able to recommend to others as there are too many great restaurants in Pheonix with amazing food and service."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!!  was eating here last nite me and wife and found a four inch long  pice of  hair in my food it was so disgusting I really did like coming here but will never come back!!!  even worst was manager first didn't even come over to apologize had to ask to speak with her she acted like it was not a big deal she offer to take off that order she should have taken care of my whole bill really bad management disgusting food prep seriously how dose that happen no reason at all to ever happen do not eat here"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday last weekend with my parents. We all ordered different types of pasta, which were all delicious. The portions don't look too big, but they are very filling, and the flavors are terrific. I had the chef's special, and would absolutely go back and order it again! Since it was my birthday, they brought us out a complimentary dessert, which was a perfectly light and delicious sweet treat. 

The hosts and waiters were all very friendly, always smiling, and very knowledgeable and attentive. 

Prices were not too bad considering the quality of the food. Everything is priced a la carte style, so be mindful of you're cost-conscious."}
{"text":"OK.  This is a review after a second visit.  The wait staff are great.  That is the best thing that I can say.  For someone that is a chef for Food Network, this is a JOKE.  First time, we ordered the fish that was perfect.  Pasta was sticky.  The potato chips appetizer was fried way before hand, no salt, and seasoning was poor.  Wine prices are 300% above retail pricing. 

Tonight, second visit, the meatballs were good.  We has a party of 25 that was split among 3 separate areas despite a 2 month warning for a party.  

The meatball plate waw small for amount but OK. Three meatballs for $10.  They are pushing it for dollars/value.   The Short Ribs I ordered, was a 15% fatty hunk of skirt stake about 2mm thick.  Granted it had good taste, but there were no ribs, and it was a joke. If you want bread with your meal, bend over and pay for it.  We did not pay for the $8.00 table bread plan of bullsh*t.  .  We did pay $2.00 to get a basket of four pieces of bread.  

So, it's overpriced and a joke....  Marginal food with an empahsis on bizzare ingredients to \"make a statement\" in the foodie world.    There are sooooo many places in Phoenix that provide great food at decent prices.  I think in 12 months they will be gone."}
{"text":"Made reservations because of EATER article. Did not mention celebrity chef restaurant, just the great food. Boy, were they right. The fritters and burrata were delicious. The signature pasta was very tasty. The Torchio pasta was good but not memorable...
Th service was on point and the restaurant has a great vibe. Very fun place..."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and great food.  The service was not good.  We waited fairly long before we got served.  A couple that sat down after us got served with drinks already before anyone talked to us.   This place is probably best for grabbing a drink with a friend."}
{"text":"Very nice!  Food and service was outstanding!  Roasted beets - awesome!  Delicious pasta and wine!  Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I came in and sat at the bar. I was immediately greeted by the lovely bartender Jessika. I asked for recommendations on both the food and a wine selection. She was super knowledgeable and gave me the perfect combination. I had the Vermintino and Orata, Was blown away. The playful banter between her and the tall blonde bartender kept me entertained throughout my visit. I will definitely be back for them!"}
{"text":"Food is good, except for Pizza, whoever makes the pizza should learn how to stretch the dough properly.  The crust was too thick on the outside and way too thin in the middle. Seafood pizza has 6-7 overcooked mussels, a couple popcorn shrimp, and a lot of squid, no cheese???
Main reason not to return is the MUSIC! It would work in a restaurant on Ocean Dr. in South Beach Miami. It is awful!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced for the quality of the food. I got the pasta with sausage and it tasted like a hamburger helper. Nice place for drinks."}
{"text":"I really want to love Mora.  It's a great addition to the neighborhood and a wonderful concept.  I have been twice and found the food to be good, but the service and experience don't match the vision and food.  I hope the management invests in training and a more cohesive team.  I am rooting for Mora but had a terrible experience when we booked a large party for a birthday.  I spoke with the manager and don't want to rehash it here.  I will try back in a few months."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience. I expected a decent restaurant given the combination of Conant and Pomo owners. Couldn't have been more disappointed. We walked in an hour before closing and sat at the bar, clearly annoying the blonde bartender. Ended up ordering some Peroni's after picking my (newly married) husband up from the airport after a week away and were so happy to grab seats at the bar. My husband nudged his beer trying to read the drink menu after a cheers to being home and it spilt a little on an already clearly waterlogged food menu. We ordered and he just wanted to look at a menu being born and raised on the French- Italian border. The bartender was non-existent and when she saw that he grabbed a non wet menu to just understand what they have to offer she commented 'Want to get another one wet and ruined?'. Uhhh I have worked at plenty of restaurants including ones that had paper menus and is it nice to ruin them(Houston's, CPH)? No. Was it purposeful? Absolutely not, and her only response was that he may have been over served (he landed from an international connecting flight at 8:45 PM, we were there at 9:02, he rarely drinks so he was just tired from 26 hours of travel, but even sober people spill a beer from time to time ). Sorry that two newly weds may be so happy to be united at a new restaurant in our neighborhood, that you decided to accuse over serving as an issue for your poor manners and service (1 beer each for an hour there). Seafood pizza (yes, a mistake in retrospect but I never thought this collaboration would put something horrible on the menu). The clams and mussels especially were full of sand and grit. Pizza crusts so much thicker and less authentic than Pomo. Couldn't even hold a piece of it, it was so waterlogged and overly topped with arugula. We were comped a beer for the 'misunderstanding' after telling the bartender she was rude, and we could've asked for a manager, but I know what low quality food tastes like and we weren't interested in a free dessert. POMO is downgrading by being associated. We will never return. I'd go to Cibo anyyyyyy day over ever returning for the biggest waste of $50. We also still tipped (over 10% which is extremely low for my usual standards). For once, my European husband convinced me to tip against every grain in my body but I've worked in the industry too long to not to."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place.  I love the décor and the layout.  The food is decent, but unfortunately not extraordinary, and therefore not worth the high price point.  I've been there a few time, but on our visit this past Saturday, we had some challenges.  We weren't seated until almost 25 minutes after our 8pm reservation, which was fine because we had a drink at the bar. However, from the moment we were seated, our server was so aggressive about pushing us through our dining experience at lightning speed.  When he asked if we were ready to order, we told him we needed a few minutes to look at the menu .....no lie, he came back 90 seconds later to see again if we were ready. When presented with a question on the menu, his response was confused and we didn't feel confident in the information provided. As for the food, the sear on the meatballs was so dark and thick that a knife could not cut them, unless you approached from the other side.  The halibut was a little dry, and the Torcchio pasta was pretty close to room temperature.  It was the first time my guests had dined there, but unfortunately, I'm not sure they will return.  I'll give it another shot, though, because I do want to like this place."}
{"text":"We arrived early for our reservation to have a drink at the bar. The cocktails are very creative and thoughtful. And the bar staff is very good at what they do. It was a Wednesday night and a little quiet so they were taking the opportunity to train some new bartenders. It was impressive to watch them explain their methods and approach. Great drinks and great service. But when we sat down to our table is when the real show began. We had the 6-course tasting menu with wine pairing. A steal at $80/each. Our first course was a non-rising focaccia filled with soft cheese. It was about the size of a medium pizza. The second course featured two dishes. One was a radicchio salad and the other was burrata. The third course was also two dishes. One was pork and veal meatballs over semolina pudding and the other was wild mushrooms and truffles over creamy polenta with bacon. The fourth course was the pasta course. Again, there were two options. The first was a squid ink campanelle with clams and bread crumbs. The other was chef Scot Conant's renowned pomodoro. It lived up to the hype. Our fifth course was a beautiful lamb shank over Israeli couscous. We finished with a salted caramel budina (kinda like a pudding) with gianduja crumble, sea salt and fresh whipped cream. We couldn't have been more impressed with this restaurant. Our server (Jeff) was impeccable. He was personable, knowledgeable and attentive without becoming intrusive. I give Mora 10 \"Jeff Goldblums\" out of a possible 10 \"Jeff Goldblums.\""}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Mora when I visited this past weekend.  The Italian waiter (I don't quite remember his name) was fantastic! Excellent service and food! I highly recommend the Pomodoro pasta and the chocolate cake!!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in hottest area. 
Nice Italian décor , wall very nice with pictures famous Italian actors .
Expectations are high from us, everything makes us think that we would have had an experience wholly unique and very Italian. Unfortunately we find ourselves in front of the classic American restaurant with Italian sign outside.
Why guys using  italian name if is American ? to attract customers ?
anyway We start with cavatelli pasta and of course I expect of fresh homemade pasta but unfortunately it was packed, precooked, taste was not bad but homemade pasta has an added value AND my son ordered a pizza with seafood Well what about to forget as soon as possible.
Bland tomato with some seafood topping and cherry tomatoes. the dough was hard without weaving 17$ and 21$ cavatelli , appetizer of polenta and two glasses of wine and the bill comes up over $ 100 with tips. Definitely expensive considering that after all we did not eat meat. Casual restaurant NO, Italian restaurant NEITHER.
 I'm from New Jersey and I know Italian food very well."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!  My husband and I lived in Italy for 4 years, and this is the most authentic pasta we have had since moving back.  Not over sized, extremely flavorful and cooked al dente.  It was perfect!  Then, to top it off, they have three wines on the menu that I have not seen anywhere else in the US.  The Friulano, Ribolla Gialla (Both white wines) and the Schioppettino (red wine).  All three are from the Friuli region in Northern Italy where we used to live.  Just the fact that they carry amazing wine that I can't find anywhere else ensures I will be back...frequently.  Make sure you go early or make a reservation."}
{"text":"If there is just two of you,  get a reservation for a table in the bar area. We got there at 6:30 on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Very happening scene! The lighting on the bottles above the bar is fabulous and the lighting in general is just wonderful.

The food is bursting with flavor!  I can't recommend this place highly enough! That being said don't over order as everything tasted very rich.   My husband had the bean soup, also delicious and Rich, spaghetti Pomodoro and a side of the roasted beets and could eat half of it all. I had The meatballs were soft and delicious but they were sitting on a river of semolina pudding and I have to tell you it was pretty darn rich!   My Caesar salad came in a small bowl but it was also very rich.  Okay, so you get my point!   But this Mora will see 'mora' of us.  Seriously,, this is fantastic food prepared by well-known celebrity chef Scott Conant or his disciples !"}
{"text":"The food was ok but not incredible. It was difficult to get a table and the server definitely wanted us to leave the moment we finished our meals. I was so excited for this place to open but was slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here based on the write up of the chef but I was disappointed.  The service was good but unfortunately the food was just OK.  I ordered the pumpkin soup and it was flavorless and the ravioli was too salty.  I didn't finish either dish.  It wasn't terrible but I have no desire to return and it was expensive considering the taste.  I don't mind paying a lot for food when it's fantastic...you know, when it's so good you have to return and eat it again!  But unfortunately this was not the case."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant for the first time a week ago. The service was a little bumpy with our initial server but soon enough we had multiple employees serving our group, dropping our drinks off, running our food and explaining what it was, and clearing our dishes. All and all it was a good experience. The Sangria on the menu was wonderful! Didn't get a photo of that, sadly."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed!

Scott has an amazing ability to maintain the integrity of classic Italian dishes by not trying too hard to be different.  His experience and expertise is reflected in every dish.  

All of the appetizers are amazing and the wine selection is on point.  We've had nearly all of the apps and our favorite is probably the ricotta fritters.  I was nervous these would be heavy and they were the perfect size and the flavor was really well balanced. 

The Pasta pomodoro is freaking outstanding.  Best I've ever had.  I want to try the other main entrees; I really, really do, but I've been here at least 6 times and just can't quit the pomodoro.  I dream about it.

The desserts are killer.  I'd recommend either the budino or coconut cake (I don't even like coconut and I love this cake!)

Service is top notch.  Servers are all well versed on the menu and preparation

So thankful Scott made the move to our beautiful city - can't wait to see what else he brings!"}
{"text":"This is only a three-star review because a few members of the staff need better manners.  Our party of four arrived about 12 minutes early for our reservation.  In a preachy, scolding tone, the hostess said the restaurant did not seat parties before the time of the reservation, and that we could wait at the entrance or go to the bar.   As we passed through the dining room to the bar, we noticed many vacant tables.  If it's the restaurant's policy not to seat till the exact time, fine, but there's a better way to say it.  Try something like:  Your table's not ready yet, would you like to wait at the bar?  Then the bartender decided I was taking too long to decide from the cocktail menu and said he would go make the other three orders and come back for mine.  When he returned, I ordered the same cocktail my husband had.  In a vaguely contemptuous tone, the bartender urged me to try it first, \"to make sure.\"  I did and said that's what I wanted.  He then informed me, very inappropriately, that he could have made two at once but now had to go make another one.  I pointed out that he walked away before I could order.  He replied it was because I was taking too long to make up my mind.
So much for the hospitality part of this hospitality business!  Otherwise, the food was great and our table waiter fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the tomato bruschetta, pumpkin soup and pasta al pomodoro. Each dish was well prepared, creative and delicious. They have a traditional dining room, bar area and outdoor seating. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for every occasion."}
{"text":"food & service was amazing!!! lots of great wine recommendations from our server matt & our meals were wonderful. however, the hostesses needed our table for the second turn (I'm guessing) - & multiple hostesses kept hovering around our table with the ipad & called our server's name so loudly to check in with them on our status... it was so uncomfortable & not a great end to our otherwise great evening! ladies, have a little more tact when checking on tables - please? for the customer's sake! we weren't sitting there with our bill paid & just taking up room - we left in under 2 hours for a 4 top on a Saturday night... after not finishing our coffee or dessert, we got the check & paid promptly! also, the settings for the next turn of our table were placed upon the table beside us before we even ordered dessert.... on the way out one of our diners said sorry to the hostess, just to be nice (even though we didn't affect timing) & she replied with \"no problem\". not okay to ever say in customer service... please don't make your guests feel this way."}
{"text":"What an amazing evening. The service was impeccable. The recommendations were spot on. The meal was amazing! We started with a recommended bottle of No Name and the salumi and cheese plate - any description couldn't do it justice. I had the pomodoro and hubby had a pizza. The pizza was a little soggy in the center, but the flavors were spot on. For dessert, another bottle and budino. This was one for the memory book."}
{"text":"We visited on 3/22/2017. Made reservations online. The process was smooth. 
Great gnudi is hard to find...but it is waiting for you at Mora. The portion seemed small; the taste and texture were perfection. This is one of those times when eating as much as I want would have been too much. I left feeling full and satisfied!
The wait staff were great! Very helpful and tolerant of our ordering appetizers as if they were dim sum. We had a hard time not trying all the appetizers on our first visit!
Looking forward to longer hours and brunch on weekends."}
{"text":"What a fun and lively place! I love how Phoenix has these revitalized areas. This is a great place to go out with friends for a fun evening.

We had 8 in our party and ordered appetizers family style so we got to try a little bit of everything. The octopus and polenta were 5 stars. My wife thought we could have placed a couple orders of these and it would have been an awesome dinner. She was right. The side dishes were superb as well.

The service was top notch. Quick and on the spot without interrupting the fun. They were helpful with suggestions. It is a well oiled machine.

Unfortunately the main dishes did quite live up to the expectations the appetizers set. It was a little flat and one note to steal a phrase from the chef himself. It was good but the sides were the star. 

If I could break it down the pre-meal, sides, and service would be 5 star. The main course would get a 3.  

Overall great place!"}
{"text":"We have wanted to visit Mora's since it opened, however, it is a \"fair hike\" (about an hour each way) from our residence.  We did note that the restaurant was having a wine tasting along with a tomato centered menu and decided to take a trip out.  The food was great, the wine pairings very good, the staff was courteous and attentive and Mr. Conant was incredibly approachable and very willing to sit and answer any questions.  We have already spoken with some friends and are planning a return trip (even with the drive) in the near future.  Definitely well worth the drive.  Excellent job, Mr. Conant!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a friends birthday. The atmosphere at this spot was awesome. Cool set and cool bar. We had reservations for 730 pm and wasn't able to get seated till 8. Kinda of annoyed with that. What's the whole point of making reservations if you are not seated at the time you are requesting. The waiter didn't seem all that happy to be working there and was stuck up. Heard the food was good but turns out it was just okay. Not much flavor and pretty bland. When we got our food the food temp was room temp not hot at all. The only thing good was their arugula and goat cheese salad w/ fennel. Yum! We were also almost charged for them just serving a dessert (birthday cake) that one of my friends bought. Thought that was lame but then my friend told the waiter about that and they took it off the receipt. It's like if you were going to charge us for that you should at least told us before we decided to do that. Once we all paid our waiter didn't really give us time to just chill and talk after our meal and went around to get our checks that we paid for not waiting till we left to pick them up. I would have rated it a 2 for the service and food but the decor and set up at this place is nice."}
{"text":"I have the 1st off by saying there's a new trend in higher-end restaurants is blasting music so loud that you can barely hear the person next to you this is one of the most annoying things going on not just here but many other places and I'm not very old either now far as the decor beautiful very high-end but music just doesn't match now for the food the bread board to me is not worth the $8 for 6-8 pieces of bread and for spreads they were good but not worth the money for the appetizer I got the octopus very tender a little too much char but still very good still have that ocean taste that all good seafood has and it was presented very well also had the fish that was okay little Bland needed something now for the service was God awful she was fine when she first approached us as soon as we said we didn't want anything to drink her whole attitude changed very short with us didn't really want to help us didn't explain anything it was like hurry up and Order and get the hell out I have other tables attitude so that kind of running the whole experience for me never go back"}
{"text":"came to see what Mora had to offer...great atmosphere - great service - relaxed interior - Brunch Only menu on a Saturday afternoon...ok so we'll try it. What we had was ok - Baked Eggs, Citrus Salmon, Whole Slab Bacon and Foie Gras/Chicken Liver Late - Citrus Salmon and Pate Winners! Our other choices left us wanting more seasoning/flavor and less \"darkness\" on the plates. Would we come back - probably but to try the offerings for dinner. 3 stars because I couldn't give 2.5"}
{"text":"We went for our third time and the food was good. BUT we had our credit card numbers used for on line purchases right after. We split the tab and we both had it happen the next week same day. $1,000 charges. Beware


I thought the place was fantastic... we started with burrata pea dish was good but the past pompadour was first place. The pork chop was no e a tender and well seasoned the best chop ever seriously. The Brussel Sprouts were really out of this world"}
{"text":"We tried the spaghetti pomodoro after our waitor told us it was Chef Scott's signature dish and featured as the best pasta in Food and Wine magazine. It did not disappoint. The bread cart is life changing. The veal and pork meatballs and the roasted beets were delicious as well. The sangria paired perfectly with the meal. All of the food was very well seasoned and the customer service was spot on. Our waiter, Jeff, was great! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences of my life! The decor is incredible. The ambiance is perfect. The staff is out of this world.  The food is what I call \"eye closing\" food. After my first bite, I can't help but close my eyes on bliss, and savor the flavor! Home run Scott Conant and your amazing staff! I'm so glad you're in walking distance to my house!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was amazing! 

Cocktails:
Sangria and the estillo vecchio- both were great! 

Apps:
Ricotta fritters- great!
Bread cart- nice selection of breads and spreads!
Grilled octopus- amazing! Best app that we tried! 

Entrees:
I was bummed that most of our food was not warm. It would have been better if the temperature was right. 
Ricotta and marscapone gnudi- pretty good flavors, would have been better if warm 
Strozzapreti- good flavors, but a tad salty

Dessert:
Salted caramel- good but so sweet. It's very rich!
Apple crostata- a favorite! The almond gelato was amazing."}
{"text":"From the host, to our server Francisco, the service was impeccable. 
 We arrived more than 30 minuets early for our reservation and the host showed us to our table immediately. 
We were a party of 6, we agreed on the five course Tasting Menu.        
 Everything from the first course, to the last, were delightfully delicious! We were there for 3 hours, our server Francisco treated us as if we were his only table of guests. 
 Outside of Italy, it was the best Italian food I've eaten in 26 years. 
 Beautiful atmosphere, delicious food, great service and even better friends made for a pleasurable evening.  
 We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING was amazing....
for apps had the BREAD CART(lost Italian tradition Scott is brining back properly), PORK & VEAL MEATBALLS semolina pudding, broccoli rabe pesto(excellent!!perfectly cooked), GRILLED OCTOPUS CECI and Scott's version of the  \"Caesar salad\" called Little Gem Lettuces
main courses we got the Cavatelli Duck Ragu and Ricotta & Marscapone Gnudi...all paired with a bottle of BARBERA di MONFERRATO from Piedmont region.
The two of us went there for a birthday dinner, the atmosphere was great, we sat outside during sunset and the whole experience was beautiful. Even though it is a new restaurant the staff, especially our server, Renée was friendly and very knowledgeable regarding the whole restaurant in general. Scott also came out to say hello after hearing that we are huge fans of Scarpetta and some of his other restaurants we have visited in New York/Vegas. 
Overall, I undoubtably give Mora 5 stars!! Everything was really fabulous and highly recommend to anyone looking for a new Italian restaurant; very laid back but classy atmosphere as were the staff. The food didn't come in massive portions and wasn't \"heavy\" food or drenched in oils/butters which makes it nice to be able to try so many dishes. 
Basically,if you're looking for a new \"retro/hip\" Italian spot to try go here for sure! If you are disappointed....it'll be hard for disappointment at Mora. Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Super pricey, small portions and mediocre food. I probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We were able to get an early reservation which is good bc this place really fills up on a Saturday!  Cute inside.  Cool drinks on the menu, waiter really was into them!  Kinda wish he had suggestions for the food too-might have helped that 5th star.  We started with the FOCACCIA di RECCO.  A bit over-rated to me.  My husband had MEYER LEMON DUSTED LAMB LOIN which was amazing!  I had the PASTA al POMODORO which was OK.  I think only bc I do not like chunks of onion or tomato in a sauce, which I asked about.  But got it with chicken which also was amazing.  We will be back and I will just order better."}
{"text":"There are not many more accolades I can give to Mora Italian that have not been posted already but... I will try. Went on a Thursday evening with my wife and son (a foodie himself and mixologist) and everything they brought was off the hook good. The octopus appetizer, which can be tough sometimes, was tenderized in olive oil and grilled to perfection. We did the Tuna Crudo as well. Cocktails were killer (Buffalo Rosso) and the wine list was expansive. My son had the fettuccine, my wife the Orata  and I did the Niman pork chop Milanese with their personal spin on it (nothing pounded flat here!!!) which was incredible. We did a dish of the chefs signature pasta Pomodoro just to try it and it did not disappoint. We also had the side of Brussels sprouts. We live off of Scottsdale road but the drive was well worth it. As a sidenote we ate at Pomo the night before! Chefs and owners are all to be congratulated!!! We will return!"}
{"text":"Trendy, cool atmosphere but loud.  Very loud.  Food and drinks are on the expensive side. My glass of wine was a bit stingy.  Food portions are on the smaller side for the amount of money being charged.  So...if you like trendy, loud, expensive Italian food this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Came for the official opening night, staff was very helpful and attentive, really  liked the ambience, my friend and I shared the rib eye and it was delicious! The bread cart looked yummy but we were too full to partake. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My friends and I dined at Mora for the first time Saturday night. The overall experience was pretty good. The restaurant itself is truly spectacularly! Good vibe, good music, great ambiance! The indoor/outdoor patio is amazing! The food/service experience was subpar. I dunno if it was because it's a newly opened restaurant and they are trying to find their groove, but I/we expected a lot more. The service was a bit slow. A friend ordered a Dirty Martini and their top shelf vodka was Kettle One. Now, I know some may think, that IS top shelf but I believe a restaurant of this caliber should surely have Grey Goose or Chopin or Belveder. The food was a tad bland. The only two who loved their meal, ordered the pork chop and fish. The margarita pizza was plain. There was no flavor that 'popped' to the fettuccine mushroom pasta. I expected to be blown away and sadly, was not. The craft drinks are amazing! I am willing to try this place again hoping they will have found their groove. Until then.."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful.  The food is excellent, but portions are miniscule.  The wine is great.  Where this place really falls short is the service.  The two times I've been in, including last night for my birthday, it's been slow and inattentive.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been back three times this week for the pasta el pomodoro. The food is delicious and he service was excellent. We loved our server Mikhail. He had a great personality and a lot of knowledge about the wine and the menu."}
{"text":"Food =2, Service = 0. 
\"Mora\" makes sense for the name of this place; as in \"what costs mora?\" That's what the waiter's mentality was.
Whenever I asked about two dishes he would look at the menu and see which was more expensive then recommend the more expensive option.
We started with a bottle of wine. He told us that he would recommend a bottle for us \"depending on our price point: over $200, under $200, under $100\"
I responded \"under $100\"
He recommended a $95 bottle.
Both $20, bland/tasteless pastas food came out cold.
He never came to check on us. 
Caramel bundito is a tablespoon of cool whip on top teaspoon amount of runny brown water.
Octopus was flavorful. So there is that to save this review from a 1 Star.
I really hope management can get this place on its feet because it's a great location with a great vibe!

As an update: The manager, Lance, reached out to me. He was very apologetic and concerned about my experience. 
My wife and I MAY give it another try in a few months (once they work out the kinks)."}
{"text":"This place was extremely delicious. We got to sit at the kitchen bar and watched all desserts made. It was so tempting to just want to order desserts and just skip dinner."}
{"text":"Mora Italian is an up-beat, unique spot for Italian food. The decor is a little scattered and follows no real theme - but the indoor/outdoor seating options are nice, if the weather allows. Sadly in Phoenix, the patio seating is not a viable options for the summer months (even with the misters).

The County Bread, stromboli, focaccia is delicious! It's a larger app that should be shared. The chef's signature pasta (the pasta al pomodoro) was not exciting. It was a pretty basic spaghetti. But the seared diver scallops were delicious! 

Overall it's a good restaurant. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"We went to Mora Italian for dinner and I was super excited because Scott Conant is someone I really enjoy watching on The Food Network! With the way he is always talking about food, I was really expecting a menu full of unique flavors.

I had made a reservation online about a month or so ahead of time. Considering this, I wasn't too happy with the fact that they gave us a table that faced direct sunlight. Our waitress assured us that it would only last a few minutes but it was much longer, I asked for us to be reseated at a different table. They didn't seem too happy with the request (since it was Saturday night) but said they'd look into it. Long story short, by the time they came back around to tell us a new table was available (about 15-20 minutes later), the sun had gone down so we stayed at the one we were at.

On to the meal - we started with a bread cart which was priced at $10 per table. They provide bread based on the number of people at the table, but I'm not sure if we are able to get more. We actually ended up finishing the spreads with the bread that was given to us but then thought that there was a bunch of spread, we should've asked for more bread. There was nothing too exciting about the bread cart, however so I'd recommend skipping it.

For our main meals, my husband got the Fettuccini with chicken and I got the Ricotta & Mascarpone Gnudi. It was weird that the chicken came on the side instead of tossed with the fettuccini as we expected. The taste of this dish was good but pretty basic. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the Gnudi! It was a bit dense with both ricotta & mascarpone cheeses but super yummy with the lobster & cream sauce. I was literally licking the plate clean!

Overall, due to the variety of options they offer, I'd come back and try other menu options. Maybe make some different choices but overall, worth a visit."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the entire experience at Mora . Sat at the bar and the bartenders took great care of us . The service and food was great . 7th st is very competitive but Mora will be a leader as long as it has employees like Amber n Jennifer taking care of business . Big Fan ."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this restaurant to open after hearing wonderful things about Chef Scott. We were fortunate enough to get reservations for the 2nd night and let's just say...Mora's did not disappoint!! 

First, our waiter Evan, was awesome!  He's a level 1 Som but didn't flaunt it and his recommendations from drinks to dinner to dessert were spot on. He was very attentive and even with a packed house made time to converse with us about menu items and drinks. 

We went with two appetizers to kick off the night. Chef Scott's signature Polenta and the grilled octopus.  Both were excellent! The polenta is topped with mushrooms and with just a hint of truffle and the octopus was grilled to perfection. In hindsight, given the size of the entrees, I would have ordered 3 appetizers.  

We ordered drinks before our meal. The craft cocktail list is good and both of our drinks were very tasty.  I ordered the Il Pirata (a very good tiki drink) and Monica ordered the Southside. The Southside has sugar snap pea infused gin in it and it was very refreshing! 

As for the entrees, I ordered the Cavatelli (a recommendation by Evan) and my girlfriend ordered the gnudi. Both dishes were fantastic!!!  The gnudi were small pillows of heaven topped with sauce! :-). The duck in the Cavatelli was cooked to perfection! Sometimes duck can be greasy and salty and this was neither!  My only critique would be the portion size for these two entrees.  That's probably because we could have easily taken down a double order of the gnudi because it was so delicious!  ;-) 

We went with the Mora sundae (another recommendation by Evan) and it was the perfect ending to our meal.  

All in all, Chef Scott has done a great job with this restaurant. The food, the drinks and ambience are right on for individuals that don't want to pay Scottsdale prices for an excellent local restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The staff is great, very nice and very knowledgeable. Definitely make reservations earlier than the day-of and if you don't want to sit outside, say so before you get there. I found the main course mostly average, but the appetizers and dessert were terrific. The staff does its best to accommodate a busy restaurant, so no need to be a jerk to them if you don't request inside in your reservation and they have to seat you outside. The place has a great vibe and is a cool addition to the 'hood."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago so when this restaurant opened in Phoenix, I couldn't wait to try it the next time we came into town. The happy hour is incredible! The staff at the bar are super friendly and offered wonderful drink and food suggestions. The short rib happy hour option is delicious. Quite possibly my favorite item on the happy hour menu I tasted. We ordered the octopus I thought it was OK. I felt like it was missing something. I don't think we would order that next time. Our neighbors at the bar mentioned the pork ribs were delicious, we will probably try that next time we are in town. The charcuterie board was perfect. Loved the meat, onion jam, and the cheeses. For drinks, I tasted the cocktail with bourbon and strawberries. Those are dangerous. I could drink multiple of those. The $5 rose drinks are a perfect option for happy hour. We will definitely be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant but: the pasta was not edible, it was fat and chewy and tasted of flour. The sauce was clumped up and when we asked for help from the waiter he just admitted that it was bad but there was nothing he could do. Even my cocktail was bad. The manager came over and just shrugged his shoulders and said they still had bugs to work out but never tried to make it right. This is the lowest review I have ever given and it's a shame. Beautiful restaurant on m favorite corner but I will not go back."}
{"text":"The coolest thing about Mora is that you rarely find one of those super trendy restaurants that actually does good italian! Most italian places, in my experience, are very old-school italian places, but Mora brings the food of an old-school restaurant together with the open-concept trendy space of the more modern restaurants popping up everywhere nowadays.

Our server was seriously awesome. I wish I remembered his name, but he was so incredibly attentive and came to check on us very consistently. It wasn't overly consistent to the point where you think \"please allow us just 5 minutes to ourselves.\" He would come at the perfect time when we needed refills on our drinks, extra butter for our bread, etc. He was seriously next-level awesome, and from the looks of it, all of their staff was that way. They definitely did a bang-up job with their hiring.

The food was delicious as well. We started with the bread platter/basket and it was soooo amazing. 3-4 different types of bread, with 4 different types of spread ranging from special butter to artichoke spread to eggplant spread. It was to die for. From there, my hubs and I both got a pasta (so sorry, I cannot remember the name of it for the life of me! - it's the one with a dollop of ricotta cheese on top) and it was very good. Good portion sizes to fill you up, but not be overwhelming.

Also, their cocktails were great! I'm preggo currently, so I'm always on the hunt for the best mocktail, and they easily served up their cucumber cocktail sans alchy and it was fantastic. I highly recommend!

The only downside to our meal was that our entrees took an incredibly long time to come out. I almost wonder if they misplaced our original order. It was legitimately about 45 minutes that we waited between the bread being finished and our main meals coming out. The good thing, though, was that our awesome server recognized it was taking way too long, and brought out a second app on the house to tie us over until the meal came out. It obviously wasn't ideal, but I felt like it was a nice touch to keep a customer happy. Good customer service goes such a long way.

I definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, well priced wine, good food and not uptight.  Pasta pomodoro, bread plate and tasty Chianti hit my carb load for the day! The coffee was also on point so grab a cappuccino with desert its awesome."}
{"text":"We know its considered a hot bar and restaurant with real buzz.  Our visit last night was one for the buzzards!  Service was spotty and distracted.  Two of three dishes were simply unacceptable.  Even the chef agreed that the burrata served to us at this \"farm to table\" place was rancid and the manager graciously told us \"don't worry - its on us\".  Our first visit a month ago was a delight and we ordered several of the same dishes last night with surprisingly unsatisfactory results.  We'll give it a year before returning . . . and to see if its still there."}
{"text":"A mixed and disappointing bag on our first visit. 

On the plus side, the service was great and staff seemed genuinely attentive and enthusiastic. They were knowledgable about the menu and overall took good care of us.

Sadly, the food was a different story. I had the cavatelli, with duck ragu and truffles. My pasta was undercooked and the duck was flavorful but very wet. So it was an interesting combination of part underdone and part soggy. 

For a side I had the brussel sprouts, but they were so covered in the topping (bacon and chili) I had to dig to find the sprouts. And then the first one I tried was burnt. There were a few good ones in there when I scraped off much of the topping, but it sure didn't impress for the work.

To be fair, my dinner date had the cavatelli as well and she liked it, so maybe I just got a bad plating. She also liked her beet side dish, as did I (I ate most of them since I was so disappointed in my own order).

Oh, and the bread board was a good way to start things out, it was just a shame it went downhill from there."}
{"text":"I have never given 5 * rating, but Mora is amazing. We had reservations for 8:15, we were seated by 8:18 . Our server Kat was one of the best servers we have ever had, she timed everything we ordered just perfectly, she made sure our drinks were never empty and explained a of the food. As we had read other reviews saying not to miss the bread board we started there. Kat suggested we try the polenta and I'm so glad she did. It was the best I've ever had. Next we tried the fritters and the margarita Pizza. Pizza crust, sauce and cheese were yummy. The fritters were out of this world. Next came the roasted beets, chicken and the gnudi pasta. Omg the gnudi should not be missed. Finally we listened to Chris who told us we had to try the raspberry sundae. I'm forever grateful to him this was beyond wonderful. My husband thought coconut cake was great but then he tried mine and he was blown away. Ask for Kat if you can she will not disappoint."}
{"text":"The food at Mora is amazing, but don't go there for a romantic evening. The tables are so close that the servers have to squeeze between tables to deliver food and clear off tables. We were so close to the tables next to us that talking was even awkward. The whole evening was awkward and it was all because the tables were so close together.  

That being said, the food is outstanding and the service is top notch.  If you want great food while you have other guests and servers pushed up against your table, listening to every word you say, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Large venue with cool but loud music. Chill in the air. If you are from Alaska you will find your comfort level. Freezing temperatures here!! Food is unremarkable... pasta tasty but boring. Pork and lamb dishes miss the mark.  It might be cool to have a cocktail at the bar, flirt a bit and listen to the music."}
{"text":"Our first time and it was fabulous!
We did have a reservation and were seated very promptly upon arriving. We decided to sit on the patio, which was very nice. Lots of plants and roof covering give it an indoor/outdoor feel. 

Our service was excellent and Dusty offered great suggestions and descriptions of the food.

We decided to order a bread, antipasti, pasta, and main all to share.

The focaccia di recco was unlike anything I've ever had before. It was like a very thin dough that has cheese inside and a sprinkling of salt that just makes the flavors really pop. Beware, it's huge, so don't get too full on bread.  Although it was good, if we came back, I'd like to try a different bread item.

Our server recommended the polenta with mushrooms, truffle, and bacon. It was the strangest (in a good way) appetizer I've ever had. The polenta itself was very creamy, but the MUSHROOMS OH MY!!!! I could eat a whole bowl of these alone! The parm shavings and jus were amazing as well. It was a very very good and unique dish.

For pasta, we had the torchio. My husband described it as \"stupid good.\" It was rich, homey, and comforting. If I had a fancy Italian grandma I'd imagine she would have made something like this. 

Finally, we chose the scallops as our main. At this point were were pretty stuffed, but who can say no to perfectly cooked scallops!? The veg and sauces perfectly complimented each other.

The Mora sundae was lighter and refreshing dessert. The raspberry sorbet was excellent! 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I visited Mora for the first time and am dying to go back, and here is why..... Chef Rudy personally cam out to greet us because we complimented his superb dishes and the waiter let him know that we were extremely satisfied but we never thought the chef would come to our table as the place was so busy.  The customer service was above excellent, everyone from the hostesses to the chef.  The food was authentic and lived up to our expectations so much that we closed out the place and were not hurried at all when we were still ordering a second round of drinks and dessert. Excellent all around, a very live and chic ambient that rivals any and all!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried was just so-so. Service was kind of aloof. The place is way louder than it needs to be.  Cocktails were decent."}
{"text":"The food, the service and the atmosphere were all amazing! We are huge fans of the Food Network but this is the first restaurant owned by a FN chef that we just love. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love coming here! You can't go wrong with good service and great service. I love the Pomodoro pasta"}
{"text":"I cannot give this anything but 5 stars....it really was that good! First - the place is just super cool. It's a little bit loud...but I can forgive that and chalk it up to the amazing energy that it's creating.

Second, our server was phenomenal. We asked her to pick three things for us to share - a salad, a pasta, and a pizza. Not gonna lie - I wouldn't have picked what she did and I was a bit leery, but she knocked it out of the park. The food was excellent! I've been to other restaurants of some TV Personality chefs and was not impressed. Mora was unlike those experiences.

And finally - you cannot beat this experience for the price. Two of us ate well and drank well for under $100 - CRAZY!!!

All around - great experience and restaurant. I might need to fly out to Phoenix just to go again! :-)"}
{"text":"Celebrated my wife and I's 5 year anniversary and am SO glad that I made the reservation when I did. My new favorite spot.

From the moment I made the reservation my wife knew she'd order the Ricotta and Mascapone Gnudi and she was not disappointed. It melted in your mouth and was a perfect portion. I ordered the duck ragu and it was incredible. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce and duck were fantastic. We shared the brussels sprout side dish instead of ordering an appetizer and thought they were great. 

For dessert, we split the salted caramel budino, one of our favorite desserts from multiple restaurants, and both agreed that it may be the best in the valley. 

The place was very crowded at 6 on a Friday, no surprise, the atmosphere is great. Restaurant looks gorgeous and the music, a number of cover songs, was quite enjoyable. My wife even asked if they had a specific playlist she could follow. Staff was great, can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"The reviews you read about Mora where the pasta is undercooked and the dishes are generally lacking are true. Mora fails to live up to its hype. You gotta ask: why would a seasoned restaurateur spend mega bucks opening a restaurant but fail to miss the mark on the food? It reminds me of a favorite movie quote with a little modification: if you serve good food, they will come. Why spend tons of money on fancy surroundings if the food fails? Some of the best haunts are the holes-in-the-wall where the food never misses so much so that you don't mind the Formica table tops or the thin paper napkins. You go back again and again. Mora in it's current state is NOT one of those places. They need to fix it."}
{"text":"Quite expensive for really mediocre to bad food. Took an hr and a half for our over cooked pasta to come. Disappointing, and the music is WAY to loud. Nothing special about the food here."}
{"text":"We just came home from dinner at Mora and how to write this review while I was still so impressed!  My husband and I are living in Phoenix over ten years and up until now not able to be too excited over having Italian food outside of our own home!  But at last \"Mora\" has arrived....  The pasta was incredible and the \"Bread Board\" amazing.  Besides the great service by Jeffery our server!  We can not wait to go again the two month reservation was well worth the wait..  Thank You for coming to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Mora was a pleasurable experience from beginning to end. Extremely welcoming staff, atmosphere, and patio. It was very busy, we're glad we made a reservation. But could not have been happier with our service and food. We enjoyed everything we ordered, and highly recommend the brussel sprouts, grilled octopus, the chef's signature spaghetti, and the black campanelle. Not only the food was great, but so was our server, Cat. We cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and sat outside, they have the mist going so it was totally comfortable in the warm weather. 
We ordered the Foie Gras and liver pate, mushroom and polenta, scallop crudo, and the squid ink pasts with the artic char. The mushroom and polenta was awesome, well seasoned and the polenta was so finely ground down it was almost like a mash potato consistency. The scallops were phenomenal maybe my favorite dish. The pasta was well cooked and flavorful, we finished all of it. The foie gras was really bland, it mostly just tasted like the onions it was served with. The Artic Char was almost inedible because it was so salty. Honestly, I think they may have made a mistake cooking it because it was pure salt. 
Cocktails were legit, the rose snowcone.. come on how could I not like that?!
I would give it 3/5 stars if I could. The biggest issue was I alerted our server to a tree nut and sesame allergy I have before we ordered but the bread with the pate had walnuts in it. As a result I had to take a Benadryl. They did take it off the bill, but it was upsetting."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we have wanted to come for many months!  Made a reservation today and had dinner on the patio. We had the tasting menu consisting of salads, amazing apps, pastas and dessert was amazing. Highly highly recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"This hip new Italian restaurant in uptown Phoenix flaunts a celebrity chef from Chopped. I heard good things from friends about the place and read rave reviews. I would give a 3.5 if half stars were a thing. Definitely make a reservation as the place gets packed. We made a reservation and arrived a couple minutes prior and were seated shortly after. The open kitchen concept is cool and you can see chefs tossing dough to make pizzas while you wait. I am not a fan of the seating arrangement here as it is awkward to squeeze in between tables to get to the booth portion of the two top. And you are basically less than an arms length away from the other tables and guests on either side. Makes it kind of weird and much less intimate if you are on a date or what have you. It is also very loud inside as the music plays over the speakers which forces you to talk louder. So you can hear the conversation of the close guests next to you. Now for the food. It's a new spin on classic Italian and it is well done. I ordered the Spratezzoni and the pasta pomodoro with veal meatballs. The pomodoro was excellent and the spratezonni was sub par but the duck ragu was nice. The bread cart is definitely delicious and the spreads with them are flavorful. It is a busy place, so again make a reservation and prepare to valet. The staff and servers were on top of everything despite it being busy and food was delivered in a timely manner. It's good food, but not as mind blowing as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience!   

First... the very friendly hostesses!   Sometimes I find hostesses surprisingly snobby and offputting, but these girls were super sweet and had great smiles!

The amazing decor and vibe of Mora was so much fun!   So trendy and upscale... loved it!

My fiance, Mom, and I shared a bread plate with several types of breads and dipping sauces - all were amazing!

My fiance had the chicken dish-- LOOKED PERFECT!!!
My Mom had the house pasta dish- with meatballs.  She loved it!
I had the mustard seed pork chop which was delicious...

but seriously, the BEST  brussel sprouts I have EVERRRRRRR had!  I will be dreaming of those until next time.

For dessert, I had the caramel budino - heavenly... and mom had the apple crisp which was also seriously good!

The best part of the night was our fabulous server, Jessica.... She found out I had a tomato allergy, so she took menu to the chef and had them mark everything I could safely order.  Sweetest thing EVER!

We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I waited so long for this place to open and now I can't stop going! I've been 3 times now with 3 completely different sized groups (2, 5, and 10) the service for the party of 10 and group of 5 was great! Wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. When I went with just one other person we sat at the bar and could've used just a touch more of attention but he gained my love back with a delicious espresso martini. It's perfect for dessert if you're feeling something sweet, non filling, and need a pick me up! The food is amazing. The atmosphere is upscale but comfortable. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped in to check out the menu and ambiance. The staff was almost annoyed that I was checking the place out. I had planned on sitting at the bar and getting an appetizer, but felt very unwelcomed. Shame because I eat out all the time. I would recommend entering the restaurant and not expect a gracious welcoming. This place an go away, there are many great places in the neighborhood. I suggest having a back up plan.."}
{"text":"This place has great pasta and the appetizers are really good as well. The service was on point and very knowledgeable about the menus for the food and cocktails. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Bar none, this is one of the best dining experiences I have had in over a decade. This brand new restaurant is absolutely gorgeous with a very accessible menu with super tasty options. We had the fettuccini (the best in my opinion), the pork and veal meatballs (fantastic!), and the salted caramel dessert. Our server Meagan was fantastic, I don't think I ever hugged my server before :) Scott Conant (awesome Chopped judge and chef ) was on site and was ever so kind, sweet, and warm as heck. A true Italian experience from start to finish! Be sure to check it out :)"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!  Have been here twice in the last week and have loved everything about it.  We hosted my daughter's bday party here and they did an absolutely amazing job.  We had a fantastic server in Jordan and the manager Courtney made us feel so welcome and set the stage for a truly memorable night and meal.  Thank you both so much!

The food has been just tremendous and I haven't had a bad bite.  The folks in the kitchen knocked it out of the park too!

Here are the dishes I have tried and would recommend any one of them:

Pomodoro - this is the signature dish and it won't disappoint.
Rigatoni Verde - uber tasty.
Fritto Misto - lightly battered and fried perfectly.  Big portion and is delicious.
Little Gem Lettuces - caesar salad-ish but very good.
Soppressata - spicy but packed w flavor.  Got a little soggy in the middle but solid option.
Beets - I have never ever had a craving for beets.  My wife ordered so got to try them and they are pretty dang good!  You should get them.
Pork and Veal Meatballs - rich and delicious!  You need to try these.

Great atmosphere and ambiance with a nice bar area.  I drink beer and sambuca so didn't have any fancy cocktails but they had both the white and black sambuca which was stellar because hardly anyone stocks black sambuca.

Based on the food, service, management, and decor/ambiance this is a must visit!"}
{"text":"We have read such glowing reports, so tonite was the nite we decided to try Mora.  Maybe we missed the boat, or the absence of the chef was the reason, but we were sure disappointed.  There were 4 of us.  We all tried different entrees and salads.  We started with the $10 bread plate with 4 different things to put on the bread.  I rarely have to salt anything but tonite was the nite.  None of the spreads had any taste, so I had to ask for a salt shaker.  It helped a bit.  Even the garlic was bland.  On the bread platter (which the platter itself was large)  received I believe 4 average sizes of bread and 4 sauce cups for the 4 spreads..  Then the caesar salad arrived, and it too was void of any taste that is in a Caesar salad,....no garlic, no anchovy, no salt, no lemon, bland parmesan...One person had the tomato salad with no unusual tomatoes, like zebra, or yellow, or orange, or purple, just pale pink tomatoes.  Pizza was burned on the bottom, the octopus salad had lots of garbanzo beans, itsy bitsy potatoes, some more sauce without flavor, plus  a few 4 inch pieces of grilled, or charred octopus.  The Halibut was with kind of a lemon sauce with vinegar.  We thought it was quite bad, so my husband didn't finish it.  All in all, it was pretty awful..  The place is very attractive.  Had we known the soux Chefs weren't trained and couldn't prepare food the way the owner supposedly would have expected, we would not have stayed.  We would have gone elsewhere.  So while the chief's away, the cat's sure did play...
I would say for $120 per couple, including one drink per person, it was not even worth it.  Sorry,  but this review is well deserved.  I want to give credit for the nice servers."}
{"text":"MORA has a Classy and eclectic atmosphere, custom graffiti wall art, ma delightful team and most importantly: truly original, savory, and beautiful cuisine. I'm thrilled to finally enjoy this Italian masterpiece!"}
{"text":"Added the comment about the manager and the typo on the menu.  I see another person commented on the manager. I hope his people skills improve.

Signed up on Mora's website weeks ago for details on the grand opening. Still haven't heard a word!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! The pasta is all hand made and it makes a world of a difference. Incredible food with wonderful service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I cannot possibly see what all of the buzz is about. I found the food to be bland and the pasta overcooked and tasted like pasta water which washed all the seasoning off of it. Appetizer forgotten. I would not recommend this restaurant. They have much much fine tuning to do. Conant would have been aghast at how bad our food was."}
{"text":"Place is great looking.,the naive person at the door plops us between two loud parties in a tiny table even though the place on a Monday night is only half full and even though we are obviously a older couple who might like to hear each other"}
{"text":"Drove by this great-looking, modernized restaurant one day during rush hour and decided to refer to yelp for some insight. From atmosphere, to customer service, to food...everything was splendid. I came in for a late dinner sunday night and there were no open table until 2 hours so my boyfriend and I decided to just sit at the open bar where all food services were still available. The good side to this was no wait time coming in, however, the bad side to it was there was very little space for one's comfort zone, I had to be very cautious to not invade someone's personal bubble as I was eating. Also, when I had to make my way to the bathroom, I had to push the stool all the way back (while avoiding to hit the dinner table behind me) and moving my legs to the side all while getting up. It was very uncomfortable seating. Aside from this little rough patch, I thought food was great and customer service skills were up to par. The food items I ordered were the Pasta Pomodoro, which is the chef's signature and the side of Brussel sprouts. It was my first time trying brussel sprouts and I absolutely loved it, however since this item contained bacon in it, it was on the saltier side for my personal taste. After eating the brussel sprouts and then trying the pasta, I found that my pasta was a little too bland. Nonetheless, the consistency of the pasta was perfect -not too overpowering- and you can tell within first bite that it is freshly made. I will come back to try different food items and venture out from the pasta!"}
{"text":"I came here because I saw it mentioned in a couple magazines. That's cool, but I don't understand why. 

Room temperature water was served. Maybe I'm missing something, maybe I'm not classy enough to appreciate room temperature water. I asked for ice which I was never served. 

Food here... Portion was comically minuscule. I ordered the Black House made pasta, it was over salted, and four clams were sandy.. 

Came here on a Sunday evening (08/06/17) for a disappointing, over priced, and over rated plate of sandy pasta. 

Maybe will try again on a Saturday evening. 

1 star: Great selection on wine and scotch. 
1 star: Beautifully designed restaurant, great atmosphere, chill vibe.
.5 star: food quality."}
{"text":"I really liked the bar and patio area.  If/when they start doing a Sunday brunch we'll most likely  return to enjoy those spots.  The staff and service were good and the food was OK.  Would we go back? yes, but it's not our 1st choice.  The biggest downer is that the music was so loud and the acoustics of the building seem to amplify the sound.  After we ate dinner we relocated to the bar and ordered another drink and we mentioned the loud music to our server and she said that everyone complains about it all the time. So, I'm not sure why they're not getting the hint to turn the music down a bit.  It's not enjoyable to eat in the dining area having to shout and keep saying what? what?"}
{"text":"This was my choice for our Anniversary dinner.  Food was delicious, we started out with the Pate, which was good, but too much for 2 people, Husband had the pork chop, which he loved, and I had the fish.  It literally melted in my mouth!  Of course, we had a  \"new restaurant\" glitch- the wine I ordered with my meal was not delivered (sad me).   Other than that, our waiter was knowledgeable,  and very nice.   Now if only we could have done something about the guy sitting next to us who proudly and loudly threw around the F bomb like it was the best word ever."}
{"text":"Firstly, the food itself is average at best.  The atmosphere is fantastic and the service is very good but the low score is because of price and portion.  I love Italian restaurants and have visited them all over the country and the one consistency I see is portion size.  It is pasta after all and Mora serves an almost laughable portion with a big price tag.  I have been 4 times now and I'm afraid all the dishes I've had, left me feeling hungry and deeply disappointed in what I paid.  Either drop the price or increase the portion I say."}
{"text":"We recently came to Mora for a friend's birthday dinner and had a really wonderful experience! We sat at a long table in the bar area and had two very attentive servers dedicated to our group. 

I started off with a vodka press (SO GOOD HERE if they're your jam), then moved on to red wine with dinner. The cocktails/wine are a tad pricey but that is what you expect when dining at such a nice establishment! Psssst: They do have a great Happy Hour if you aren't on a time schedule! 

To start, we split the bread board and you guys - THIS IS A MUST. If you're like me, you may think, why are they charging for bread at an Italian restaurant?! Well, that is because this is way more than just 'bread'. It is a huge board packed full of a variety of warm country bread, stromboli (YUM!), and focaccia served with the BEST SPREADS EVER! The spreads included an artichoke bomba, mascarpone butter, roasted garlic spread, and eggplant caponata (my fav). We also split their famous Focaccia di Recco - basically an Italian cheese crisp and it, too, is a must order! Both are great for groups!  

Guess what, i'm not done with starters! We also ordered their burrata appetizer and split the antipasti salad. The burrata appetizer was definitely not my favorite - it was basically a small serving of burrata with two tiny croutons. SO, you basically just eat the burrata by itself with a spoon. Not a fan. BUT the salad was a DREAM! I could definitely come back and get it for my meal. If you're getting it prior to your entree, it is definitely big enough to split.

If you didn't already know, all of their pastas are made in house soooo, they're a must. I ordered their Rigatoni Verde that came with a VERY authentic bolognese. In Italy, their bolognese isn't super tomato-y and Mora does it just like you're sitting on the cobblestone streets of Italy. Yes, please! It was amazing. Yep, I licked my plate (even after all of those starters). My husband and I also split a side of beets because we're obsessed with them. They were served warm and were super tasty!

Anywho, we're actually coming back next weekend for another birthday and I cannot WAIT!!!! Thank you for such a great experience, Mora! See you soon!"}
{"text":"This was a perfect Valentine's Day experience!  This was the third time that my wife have eaten here.  This place keeps getting better.  The place was full, but there was no element of chaos or rush, yet everything was paced perfectly. We were greeted promptly by a host of friendly people including the manager and were promptly seated at our table. It seems like the music was not quite as loud as it was on the first 2 visits.  My wife and I had no problems talking to each other across the table.   Our server was friendly and prompt.  The drinks and all of the food were perfect.  Highlights include the polenta with mushroom ragu, the cavatelli pasta with duck, and the chocolate budino - a light finish to a big meal that was still rich and chocolatey.  Oh yeah, and the bread cart.  The newly added stromboli is awesome and the young man running the cart was fun and knowledgeable.   We have been to most of the restaurants in the area, this is among the best."}
{"text":"If only the Halibut hadn't been over cooked I would have rated this place higher. Other than dry fish everything else was delicious.  Nice place & very good service?"}
{"text":"Read about this restaurant opening last year and was thrilled to hear it would be open for our March visit to Phoenix.  Lucky me- I was able to obtain a reservation far in advance.

 I honestly don't think I've ever been so disappointed.  The noise level was unbearable- couldn't hear my server's responses to my questions about the wine list so I finally gave up.  Table conversation was impossible due to the noise level, not to mention the choice of music was horrendous as well. Electronic dance music at a pulsating level so high I felt like I was at a club (which was NOT where I wanted to have dinner!)

The highly anticipated bread cart was MIA. While they comped the bread board that was brought to our table I was denied the experience I was so looking forward to. I'd rather have spent the $8 and had the bread cart I was promised!  The foie gras and chicken pate was mediocre at best.  I will say our entrees were good but due to the noise level and inability to converse we skipped dessert altogether. This should have been the highlight of our dining on our trip and it was by far the most disappointing.  Sadly, I could never recommend this restaurant to anyone and don't plan on a return visit next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful. The service was good. My first drink was a dirty martini and I could taste the dirty dish water. Came for a birthday party and all of our entrees were either dry or tough. None of us had the pasta though...Even the coconut cake was dry. Probably wouldn't be a choice to go back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Mora! This is the BEST Italian restaurant in Arizona. Incredible staff, authentic and simple ingredients, not stuffy, not overpriced, great atmosphere and vibe. Their Pasta Pomodoro is the best I've eaten State Side (Not in Italy), on the West Coast. I always order the simplest dish on the menu to test Italian food and this surpassed all my expectations. Great wine list and amazing cocktails. The manager Chris is really a stellar guy who runs a tight ship! Jay is really wonderful as well and great at making you feel welcomed. Chef Scott Conant is there sometimes and really an approachable and down to earth guy despite being a Food Network Celebrity chef. This is a real jewel in the Phoenix Foodie scene and a definite must try!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed and I really want to like this place. I'm a big fan of Chopped. It may be for a younger crowd. My husband and I are in our 50s and it was just loud between the music and people talking. The music playing was fairly loud and you could feel the bass. Very pricey for what was served. We both ordered the short ribs and they were $26 a plate. It came with zucchini and arugula (way more arugula than zucchini). The ribs were not what we were expecting, looked more like flank steak or beef tenderloin. Basically, I paid $26 for meat. The meat was cooked okay but nothing special. Nope, we will not be going here again."}
{"text":"You may have read the review below on a different page, but I felt it was too good not to share here as well. If you want a simple review, well, venture over to Mora, invest the time and enjoy every bite of whatever it is that you choose to order. You will not be disappointed. As you contemplate doing just that, enjoy the review below:

Why do you frequent certain establishments? What is it that makes you want to return time and time again? When you find a place that you enjoy, how many times a month do you go? If you chose to answer those questions, you know exactly why they were asked. 

To be direct, long winded, yet direct, let me simply say that I have never enjoyed such an original meal as I did last night, Valentine's Day. My fiancé and I have had the pleasure of dining at Mora on more than one occasion. Her birthday, our anniversary and now Valentine's Day are the occasions in which I am referring. Last night we chose to share selections from the special menu created solely for the Day of Love. From the Delicata Squash and Burrata which initiated our dining experience, to the Pasta Pomodoro setting the mood for the elaborate entrees that followed; the Olive Oil Poached Trout and the Fregola Risotto with red beets, black garlic & Parmesan fonduta and ultimately concluded with the rich flavors of the salted caramel budino our entire dining experience was something which you would only see in the movies. Each bite taken made the experience more of a dream, a fantasy if you will, than simply a Valentine's Day dinner. 

The menu, artistically created; the food, diligently prepared and the personal service delivered were all on point working cohesively to define why Mora Italian was named the \"Best New Restaurant in Phoenix for 2017\". 

Happy Valentine's Day INDEED!"}
{"text":"Came here with family that flew out to visit. Everything's was exceptional from the service to the delicious food and wine. Great atmosphere and will certainly be back. Wish Scott was there!!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 4 to bring our out of town friends here; it was our first visit as well.

5 stars for the staff -- they may be young people but they have been well trained and they really exude warmth, humor, and service. They also know their dishes and helped make some recommendations that we really enjoyed. I greatly appreciate their expert pacing as well. We we're not in a hurry so they didn't rush us but they were somehow right there when we needed them.

The cocktail list has some pretty unusual combinations but they were lovely. We really liked the bread cart, with its various options and spreads. I wouldn't order it unless I had at least 4 people at the table, though or you'd fill up on bread before you ate dinner (or waste some of that $8 bread). Everyone loved the Stromboli.

For dinner, we had:

Pork chop - the big winner of the night. Unbelievably juicy and tender with great flavor in the light crust. Our waitress described it as \"a Flintstone chop.\"  Definitely enough for 2 meals for a light eater.
Black Campanelle w/clams - this was very tasty, though somewhat disappointing. Chef went extremely light on the clams, which are not in the shell. Dish came out just warm. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the breadcrumbs gave it great texture. But I did not taste the Fresno chilis and one of the clams had significant grit in it. 
Torchio - this sausage and mushroom Ragu was flavorful and filling. In the Italian way, it's light on sauce but still a heavier dish.
Roasted Halibut - this was an off-menu special. Guest loved the flavor and it was cooked perfectly but also came out just barely warm.

We truly enjoyed the atmosphere on the patio, which is protected by excellent landscaping, so you don't have to overlook the parking lot. Overall, a very nice dinner, prices are more than fair, just a few kitchen glitches with temperature. But as I said at the beginning, excellent staff, who made the evening so enjoyable."}
{"text":"Basically, the noise level, not your palate,  is the first sense aroused. The ramped up volume is not only evident in Phoenix but Chicago and other large cities that have seem to have forgotten that baby boomers, many with the disposable income to eat out quite often, have weakened hearing from cranking up the stereos to the likes of Jimi Hendricks or Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven years ago.  That said, I anticipated more seating based on the size of the building, but quickly noticed a lot of high tops but not as many regular booths or tables. When I made my reservation, indeed, only high tops were available, which meant we would be sitting bar style. However, at the last moment we were able to change our seating to a regular table.  

As an appetizer, we ordered the liver pâté, which is mousse-like and extremely delicious (the bread accompaniment was also tasty). We also ordered the chef's pasta, which is spicy good, to share with our meals for the entire table. (Oh, and I ordered the cheaper Chardonnay and must say it was as good or better than the more expensive version at most restaurants). For dinner, I decided to go light and only asked for the Burrata cheese, which is served with fresh snap peas. I would say that my combined food choices together added up to 5 stars in terms of taste, and the wait staff including the hostess, was excellent.   So, why the four stars? A restaurant experience includes the overall ambience, seating options, and the noise levels, which could be slightly improved, especially if they turn down the volume a tad because it was difficult to carry a conversation; my two table guests both agreed.  My recommendation is to make reservations early if you want to regular table seating because they fill up quickly."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you how the food is. My husband and I walked in last night around 8:30. At least half of the tables were empty. When we asked to be seated, we were told they do not take walk ins. So, there's that. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, food was so good! They did a twist on the Lobster gnocchi for me and didn't add the lobster since I'm allergic- it's was amazing! 

We needed up eating at the bar to sit together, as most of their seating is/are very close together (tables are tight) had almost a Manhattan NY \"close table feel\" to them- but take that as a good sign, they are popular and the food is exceptional. Just be ready to be close to your neighbor."}
{"text":"We went there with a group of friends for drinks and dinner. It's was delicious. Our pasta tasted homemade and the appetizers were so great as well! I'd definitely recommend the mushroom fettuccine if you're looking for vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Having been to Scott Conant's restaurant in Vegas, the bar was set high before we even walked in to Mora. Our favorite part of dinner at Scarpetta was the complimentary bread. When we saw on the Mora menu that there was a bread cart for $10, we thought it must be amazing just like what we experienced in Vegas. We were very disappointed and it started our meal off on the wrong note. The bread was cold, and none of it was special or amazing. Even the spreads were just mediocre. The entrees were very good, and the pastas are something special. However, if you're going to charge $10 for bread, it better be amazing and mind blowing, and that it was not. To not even take the time to warm it up is really a shame."}
{"text":"I grew up in my grandma's house with her Italian cooking. (Sauce spread on the back of a piece of white bread to taste.) I also worked 10 years for a family owned restaurant. (The owner personally checked on and chatted with each table). I learned more from those two people than my own parents! Scott has created a fun, yet intimate environment with food that is made with love...just like my grandma's house and you can feel his presence even when he's not there. When he is, you can be sure he's stopping by to say hello with a giant smile. I have loved everything I have tried. I think my favorite so far is the Ricotta & Marscapone Gnudi with Lobster. The gnudi are like little cheese pillows. Hubby loves the Roasted Chicken and Pasta Pomodoro. Sooo delicious! The chicken falls off the bone and the sauce on the Pomodoro is fresh and a perfect blend of herbs and spice. The service is impeccable. I was talking with my hands, of course, and hit my glass of wine. There was someone there before I could blink, cleaning up my spill and making me NOT feel like a complete ass. I somehow caught the glass with the same hand. Reflexes are on point, just like this restaurant! Don't miss out! 
Thank you Scott & Jay for amazing experiences every time! 
PS dont forget dessert .. salted caramel budino ..Decadent!

{"text":"Incredible! My one word to discribe my experience at Mora last night. My husband and I decided to celibate our 8th year together at Mora. After months of people raving about this Italian eatery I was really looking forward to trying this place out. I've heard how crazy long the waits were and I'm happy to say we didn't have to wait this night. We got a cozy little height top for 2. We started with an Old Fashion and their Il Pirata: pinneaple rum, don q gold rum, grapefruit, lime, maple syrup, passion fruit, vanilla. Both really great cocktails. Really enjoyed the smoothness of the maple syrup and vanilla in my Pirata. We decided to take the side of brussle sprouts and make them our appetizer. Great idea, it was the perfect light start. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and charred on the outside. We knew we wanted the PORCHETTA fior di latte, salsa verde, pickled chili pizza. We just couldn't decide on which pasta dish we wanted, so our waitress recommended the RICOTTA & MASCARPONE GNUDI lobster and guanciale ragu. She said we would not regret it. She was absolutely right. I've never experienced such a delicate and sinfully decadent meal. This was also my first time trying Gnudi. For those who are not familiar, it's usually a dumpling like dish. In this case Ricotta & Mascarpone rolled into balls, dredged in flower and boiled. Once done, they are bouncy on the outside and gooy on the inside. That paired with the perfectly pouched lobster tail was life changing. Dramatic I know... but so true!! It's something everyone needs to experience. The Pizza was very good as well, nice crunchy wood fired crush, good amount of cheese and sauce, we really loved the addition of the pickled chilies, made for a fun twist, and the Porchetta was a bit crispy which I really enjoyed. We finished up with the SALTED CARMEL BUDINA: gianduja crumble, sea salt, fresh whipped cream. And added a side of Vanilla Gelato. The Budina was the perfect finish to this meal. It complimented the delicacy of the Gnudi we had had for dinner. Light, layered, whipped, salty and sweet. I will say I wish we would have gotten a coffee instead of the gelato. Would have been a better pairing. Still tasty though. 

The open layout, contemporary vibes, lively bar, and cute but large patio would be fun to come back get happy hour with friends and family. The regular menu is a bit pricey but worth it. More of a date night, special occasion kind of place for me. This restaurant will be at the top of my birthday dinner list."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Food, service, setting, all of it was amazing. We had the meatballs as an appetizer. They come in a semolina pudding that I'm sure is mostly heavy cream and cheese (as all good things are). For our entrees I got the pasta al pomodoro. This is basically a tomato sauce, but I have no idea how they get so much complex favor in such a simple sauce. I'm assuming black magic. My husband got the torchio and loved it. Again simple dish, amazing flavor. For dessert we got the zeppole and the restaurant comped us the sundae since it was our anniversary. I preferred the zeppole and my husband preferred the sundae. If you get both I strongly recommend dipping the zeppole in the uncooked cheesecake that comes with the sundae. I also had the sangria, which is the best sangria that I've ever had. If you go, I recommend sitting at the kitchen bar. It's fun to get to see the kitchen at work and guess what the dishes are. It's a great date restaurant because it's a little fancy, but not too fancy. You never feel out of place and the food is fancy but somehow nostaglic and comforting. Like if your Italian grandmother opened a five-star restaurant"}
{"text":"Dinner w 6 people.  Started w lively drinks by the bar before dinner reservations began.  The room felt alive with great cheers all around.  The bartenders were friendly and attentive.  Dinner from apps, sides, main and desert were spot on!!!  Friendly service with food portions just right.  I feel we had one of everything on the menu and not one item was left on the plate.  Personally, the fettuccini was my favorite pasta dish with the coconut cake three me over the edge in a good way.  Highly recommend the bread plate for the table, a side of long beans and polenta.  Simply delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here tonight to celebrate my wife's new job. The atmosphere is really cool. It felt like urban meets vintage Italian. A lot of red pops of color in the place, but very tastefully done. Onto the food, we ordered two antipastos - first one the burrata and second one the calamari. The burrata was absolutely delicious - melted in your mouth. But the calamari... wow was it salty. The breading on it felt heavy even though the waiter said it was light. I also wished it would have had a sauce to dip it in. The combo of fries and zucchini was a nice touch. I actually enjoyed that more than the calamari. Onto entrees, I had the duck ragu (can't recall the fancy menu name at the moment). It was good but it was very savory. After a few bites, I grew tired of the same taste on my palate. In other words, it really lacked balance. Something sweet or crunchy added to it would have done the trick. Finally dessert - we ordered gelato. Wow, was that good. We had pistachio, chocolate and vanilla at the table. Very milky and very heavenly. Overall, I would recommend this place and I definitely plan to go back. Going with friends would be really fun, as it feels like you're at a club. It is not an elegant place, so don't feel the need to dress up. Also, it's a bit overpriced for what you get portions-wise and service-wise."}
{"text":"Mora is an absolutely gorgeous restaurant. It almost reminds me of Arrogant Butcher in downtown Phoenix with the open kitchen and beautifully designed interior except Mora is better in that aspect. I love coming here for dinner parties or celebrations. 

For starters, we always get the bread cart. There's plenty of bread to go around and the dips are delicious. I could honestly eat all of them with anything. My two favorites are the mascarpone butter and the roasted garlic spread. Definitely worth it for $10. We have ordered the Fritto Misto (calamari) and it is pretty tasty. There have been times that their calamari was overcooked.

For dinner, I only ever get their POMODORO. I can confidently say that it is one of my top pasta dishes of all time. Apparently this pasta has won several awards. The pasta itself is cooked perfectly. The sauce is amazing, not too rich. The dish altogether is simple. The gnudi is pretty good too. I've had the strozzapreti before which I was not a fan of. I thought the truffle was too overpowering. My main complaint about the dishes are the serving size. Mora is pricey because the dishes come in small servings unfortunately. 

The service has always been consistently good. They offer valet parking as well."}
{"text":"Super hip decor! Who knew Arizona?! Grilled octopus appetizer was delicious. We tried the truffle pasta special of the evening. And the whole fish was melt in your mouth good. My dinner partner tried the lamb which is our servers favorite, unfortunately not ours. It was tough. I'd go back for some homemade pasta next time."}
{"text":"So took my wife here for her birthday last night along with some friends! The food was good but not great and overpriced for what they are serving. I get that dude is a celebrity but cmon, l don't mind spending money on food but it needs to be worth it and this was just okay. Also I expected as slow as it was last night to get helped right away that being said took over ten minutes before we even put our drink orders in. Our waitress was super sweet and nice but slowwww getting around to us and the restaurant just wasn't that busy to have to wait as long as we did, sh either needed to have less tables or maybe a busboy to be helpful with removing dirty plates and helping with filling up waters and so forth!"}
{"text":"I love Mora. I have been waiting to come here for months so my excitement was through the roof. The inside was dark and really neat. The music was loud which I think is always a bonus. We started off with some martinis. The basil grapefruit was great. It did take a little bit for our drinks to come out. We started off with the bread board, and the cheese board. Both were pretty good. We also had the veil meatballs which I loved. The portions are pretty spot on. We had the duck pasta which was delicious but hands down the must try is the Pomodoro which is the chefs special.... and I can see why. Overall it was a good experience, the food was great, the service was good as well. Great place to go and sit at the bar as well! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for dinner Friday night after I arrived back in town from a work trip. 
This place is still quite the buzz in Phoenix and it was super busy when we arrived.  We were seated at a table in the bar area (not very pleased about it) and it was quite noisy.  The restaurant is beautifully appointed, the service was fantastic and the food was quite good. 
We ended up sharing a side of the brussels sprouts, the pasta pomodoro (my absolute favorite) and the ricotta and mascarpone gnudi with lobster - all quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday....I celebrated my wife's birthday @ Mora. From the hostess to the waitress service was excellent. For it been my 1st time...I can tell you that it's a very nice place with a great atmosphere. Not your typical Olive Garden Italian food...so be prepare to pay a little bit more. They also provided a complimentary valet."}
{"text":"Yes, I admit I went here because I like Chef Conant and wanted to see his restaurant in the valley.  Especially since I don't live in New York City.  We came there for happy hour.  They have a nice happy hour menu that is quite reasonable.  We ordered an appetizer platter then a dessert to share.  It was the perfect amount.  We ordered the meat and cheese platter to share. Nice selection on the platter. Then we ordered the Caramel Budino dessert.  Wow.  I would go back just for that dessert alone.  They serve a tasty sparkling wine for $5 during happy hour which was quite tasty.  Service was decent.   They have valet parking for the entire lot (but for the two handicapped spots in the front)."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last night and had an interesting experience. I ordered the duck pasta (can't remember the name) and it was delicious. My waiter recommended a wine that went perfectly with it and it was great until I found two large pieces of bone in my dish. The server and manager were very apologetic and offered a complimentary dessert by way of apology. The manager recommended a banana sticky toffee pudding which was delicious but the bottom of the pudding was burnt to a hockey puck consistency. Despite serious effort, we couldn't cut through the bottom with spoons and this is supposed to be a bread pudding dessert. Again our server was apologetic (not his fault, after all) but at that point all I could do was laugh."}
{"text":"Expectations were rather high.. love the guy who opened this establishment or at least from what I've seen of him on Top Chef, I know Scott wouldn't have been pleased either with what I experienced. We were let down oh so hard. Let's just say everything was great up until the entrees. The grilled octopus dish was delicious and the bread plate of different breads and spreads was delicious and something new that I've come across in Scottsdale. 
Unfortunately the dinner entrees were cold and mediocre. We had to set back the ricotta and mascarpone gnudi THREE times because the center of the pasta was not near warm whatsoever. It was so upsetting. We had to watch each other eat separately and our dinner experience was pretty much a mess. Our waiter seemed to be avoiding  our table while this all was going down.. and on top of it, not one thing was taken off the bill as a common curiosity for having served a cold entree dish (three times). ugh. 1 star."}
{"text":"This place has great food, beautiful decor, and a wonderful ambiance. Went with a friend for happy hour and had appetizers and specialty drinks. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Scott Conant does not disappoint with his new restaurant Mora Italian. We had the bread board with yummy spreads, pasta and roasted beets. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The coconut cake is a must to finish out the evening. We even got to meet Scott on our way out. This place will be a favorite when we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! Fun vibe!! Darling hostesses and we had a lovely waitress. 
Bread cart was delish!! However with a table of 4 we had to cut some breads in half so everyone got to taste the salami cheese bread. Maybe have 3 bread choices with 4 slices of each.  

The kitchen had run out of Halibut by 7 pm.
The Rose snow cone was amazing!!
Maybe the kitchen was hit hard for fish on Thursday April 27.
We will be back to try it again.

We have been back twice and the food was divine!! Service great and the Rose Snow cone doesn't disappoint!!
Excellent duck pasta!  Halibut was delish!! 
Great vibe as always!!"}
{"text":"Service is stellar and pasta is yummy. Beau & I celebrated his birthday here this week and the dinner was a relaxing pace with attentive servers. There are a few tiny items that would take Mora to the top of my Eats list: bread & preventing blinding sunlight. 

The burrata salad was uniquely dressed with lemon and loaded with snap peas. We requested some bread on the side and it was promptly brought to the table. The Italian bread slices made me want to run to Noble Eatery for a more suitable bread for Mora's burrata salad. It is a desperate request for this restaurant to consider better bread accompaniments to their creative menu. 

Secondly some of their tables face east/ west. Choose the north/south tables to avoid a blinding sunset as apparently the outdoor shades are not effective. This is OK at a fish stand but uncomfortable at a $100 dinner."}
{"text":"When my wife and I heard that Scott Conant was opening a restaurant in Phoenix, we couldn't wait until we could go.  I kept an eye open for the Grand Opening in hopes of scoring a reservation until I saw they opened 2/3/17 and realized why not go for Valentine's Day instead.  We had reservations at 8:30 and had no issues with getting a table.  They have a great little patio so we requested to sit outside since the weather was perfect.  

For Valentine's Day they had a very specific, 4-course menu for the night.  All the items can be found on the dinner menu every night minus the desserts.  Not sure if they have a separate dessert menu on hand since it was included for tonight's meal.  My wife added the wine pairings for her meal while I just ordered a barolo rye cider.

It started off with the bread cart which had 3 types of breads and sauces.  Ours had the focaccia, stromboli, and ciabatta.  It came with a garlic and olive oil mix, an eggplant caponata, and an artichoke bomba.  The stromboli was my favorite as it had Italian meat and cheese baked right into it.  It was a nice little appetizer to start.

For the antipasti second course, my wife had the heirloom tomato salad and I went with the polenta.  The tomatoes in hers were just delectable but nothing beats the polenta I had.  It was out of this world good.  It was so silky smooth and served in a bowl of the best gravy/broth with mushrooms on top.  Truly the best thing I had all night.

Main course, my wife ordered the Cavatelli with duck ragu and I went with the Spaghetti Pomadoro.  Nothing beats hand made pasta cooked to perfection.  They both had just the right amount of sauce and weren't swimming in excess oil.  The duck was tenderly cooked and added a wonderful richness.  The pomadoro sauce has a little kick to the sauce but was such a fresh tomato and basil goodness.  Hands down, the best pasta dishes I've ever had.  My wife was in Rome last year and she said it was very much on par if not better than what she had while there.

For dessert, she chose the Cubano Coconut cake and I had the Smoked Chocolate Budino.  The cake was 12-layers and was a huge slice.  We took half of it home with us.  It had some rum and lime running through it as well.  No complaints with the cake at all.  Not the best thing ever but more than passable to have as a dessert.  Now the budino on the other hand, that is the best chocolate mousse/pudding/whatever that I have ever placed in my mouth.  I'm not a big overtly-chocolate fan but this...decadent is the perfect word to describe it.  The subtle smokiness that came through pushed it over the top.  

The staff was on point this night.  We had multiple servers stop by to check on us and clear plates, bring more water, pour the next wine pairing, etc.  Our server was Mike and he was incredibly friendly and has a real passion for the restaurant.  He  gave insight on the menu, let us know that the menu is going to change to focus on seasonal ingredients, was incredibly polite.  The only hiccup of the night was he brought me a wine pairing for the first course.  I told him I hadn't ordered the wine pairing portion because I'm not a wine drinker.  without hesitation he said, \"My apologies.  This glass is on us then and I will make sure to remove that off the bill.  Can I get you anything else?\"  That is the kind of service that bring you back for sure.

All in all, we had high expectations for coming here.  The restaurant still exceeded them in every possible way.  Without question, we will definitely be back.  I wish I could dock a star off my review but I have nothing I can complain about.  Truly a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. Great atmosphere and the layout of the restaurant is inviting. The bread basket is a must! Each dish we tried was tasty and authentic. My only recommendation is a revamp of the wines by the glass list for some higher end choices. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place has some amazing dishes and a great atmosphere. It's not cheap but worth the price. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Mora last night with friends.  We eat out together often at a variety of restaurants in the Px Scottsdale area.  We were disappointed with our experience.  First, we had to shout to each other to have any sort of conversation. Background music is nice, but a DJ, at a restaurant?  We asked for a quieter location and the quietest we could get was outside patio on 7th street side.  Whoever thought street side would be \"quiet\"?  Anyway, we appreciated this effort and it was slightly quieter.

Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu items.  However,  delivery of our orders was painfully slow.  Just two glasses of wine took nearly 15 minutes, the Foie Gras appetizer nearly 30 minutes!  Our friends ordered the Octupus appetizer and enjoyed it very much.  The Foie Gras was delicious!  We all ordered pastas for our entree, the duck ragout was good but not outstanding.  I ordered the Black pasta with clams and found it way too salty.  Because of the hour and because I was hungry, I ate nearly half. The rest did not go home with me.  Another companion had the fettuccine entree and also found it too salty. We waited anywhere between 30 - 45 minutes after our dishes were cleared before our server came to check on us.  We were never offered coffee or desert. We asked for the check and left.  The several glasses of wine we each ordered during dinner came promptly.

Because of the appetizer delay we were gifted the Bread Board, a very nice gesture and it was delicious.  The restaurant is a beautiful and spacious room and hopefully the music can be turned down to be truly background music.  We plan to return to try other interesting items on the menu but will give the restaurant time to work on their delivery of food items.   By the way, we are couples in our late 60's and love music and enjoy going out to listen and dance to good music.  When we go out to eat, we want good food, not loud blaring music."}
{"text":"Had a great first time here. Let's just say I will be back for sure. 

The concept, the atmosphere, the ambiance, the food and the service was great. The whole package of everything and especially for only open less than 3 months was great.

We had a table of 7 with 2 kids so there was a special person that had to handle us lol and that was Kendra. Seriously hats off to her. More to come. 

We started with the bread for the table and the accompanying spreads were fantastic. The bread was good, fresh, and the display was nicely done. Check my pics. We ordered the FRITTO MISTO calamari, rock shrimp, herbs, vegetables appetizer to share and it didn't need any sauce to dip it in, just the lemon top and it was so excellent. Perfectly cooked and not to heavy breading.

The meals we had were:
CHICKEN IN POTACCHIO with fennel
TORCHIO which was my dish and absolutely fantastic. I asked Kendra about it and she said it was good and she was right.
GRILLED SCOLLIPINE OF BEEF SHORT RIB with calabrian chili glaze, charred zucchini, arugula
BLACK CAMPANELLE clams, fresno chilis, bottarga breadcrumbs and the pasta was dyed with squid ink
FETTUCCINE

I tried every dish from all the plates and I would order everyone again. Fantastic!!!!

Dessert came and we had the salted caramel budina that had gianduja crumble, sea salt, fresh whipped cream and apple crostata with oats, cranberries, warm apple compote, caramel mascarpone, toasted almond gelato

Let's talk about Kendra. She was fantastic. She took care of us made recommendations, was personable, checked in with the kids, took care of our drinks nicely and really made a good impression. Her spunkiness with her blue hair out of that fun vibe and really delivered. She was smiling the whole time and actually enjoyed working there and even said she loved it when we asked. I will ask for her again. 

This is my style of restaurant the way everything is put together and I enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"Took forever to be seated, even with a reso. Waiter literally disappeared for an hour. Food was disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is ok, portions are small but the service is INCREDIBLE and the atmosphere is AWESOME! The manager was extremely accommodating after the size of my party kept changing. We had a wonderful time dining at one of Phoenix's newest restaurants."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing! I have been twice now and the second time was even more incredible than the first. The meatballs and brussels sprouts are a MUST! Service is spot on and the ambiance could not be better. Scott has really brought something special to the up and coming central phoenix neighborhood. Kudos."}
{"text":"Popped into Mora a couple times now.  Beautiful décor from the art, to the colors, to the bar top, to the big glass doors and very open kitchen.  Very trendy and lively.  Nearly everything I've tried there has been pretty good to great.  Their cocktails are fantastic.  My experience with the service has been great anytime I've been in there.  Which brings me to my story.

My girlfriend and I don't side seat.  And if we did, we would never attempt to do so when it clearly impacted someone else's space.  Common courtesy, keeps the world from going into full blown chaos like what you have in San Francisco with people defecating in the streets.  Yeah, I blame side seating for why turd alert apps exist.  I digress.

So here we are, sitting across from one another trying to enjoy ourselves next to some old pretentious douche and this girl who can't stop shuffling through pictures of her favorite selfies showing him - every reaction by the way being as equally jaded as the last.  This guy is essentially insider trading.  He already knows he'll get laid later, why put out the effort to care.  You only act like you're surprised that you pulled off a massively lucrative stock trade when the SEC is looking your way.  I hold no such credentials though, so he proceeded to just sit there and bitch about how salty his food was and how slow the service was.  Oh yeah, and constantly shuffle his table back and forth taking away more, and more space away from my girlfriend.

Keep in mind, this guy had already flipped his table to the side before we were even sat next to him so that he and his walking selfie could side seat.  It's not like he was even making an attempt to contain himself from there.  Legs kicked out, hands resting uncomfortably close to my girlfriends limited space.  I think what really got us though was just how badly he was treating his server - mind you, the server was composing himself pretty damn well all things considered.  I mean shit, he was probably beating a busser in the back with a tray at that very moment, but is a man not to express at least a little rage?  

That's probably what ended up pushing us to do what we do best.  Passive aggressively talk shit just loud enough to throw off his already weak game.  Even pulled the server to the side a few times acting like I had questions on the menu, but was in reality letting him know that we knew about the current struggle.  Plus, I had a lot of jokes about spiked dildos to tell this guy.  It was like good humor philanthropy.  Again, common courtesy.  Eventually, it was time for them to go.  He let the server know that they'd be back in a few months and will give the place one more try.  Hah.  Barf, right?  He then packed up his selfie stick and then proceeded to unlock my final fuck I had to give.  The guy, instead of scooching along the side where there wasn't anyone else, had to squeeze past the limited space he had created in the first place, and slide his old ass on our table.  Oh, so this is the direction we're going to take it in.  Ok.  Ok.

\"Yo, dude, get your ass off our table.  Like, really.  Jesus Christ.  You're pushing my water around.  Your ass, is in my water.  Beat it.\"

This lizard person had the audacity, mid way through pulling splinters out of his ass cheeks, to turn around and look shocked that anything was said.  I'll never forget that look.  That was the look of a complete lack of indignity.  That was the look of the world being his oyster, and he was going to fucking sit his wrinkly ass in that half shell.

\"Well, at least it's a nice ass?\"  He says, nervously chuckling.

\"Nice ass, best ass, Kardashian ass, worst ass, I don't give a fuck.  Get your ass, off our table.  Have a good night, beat it, bye, toodles.  Jesus Christ.\"

And that was that.  We laughed for a bit with the other servers.  One came over and said that we made that other guys night.  I wonder if that old man ever came back in, or if that giant, botox'd up cellphone \"likes\" gargling, selfie stick of a woman literally blew him to death.  It's possible, given the mans age and extreme aversion to salt.  Clearly was monitoring some heart problems there.  Moral of the story though?  Be nice to your servers.  And don't side seat.  No one likes it.  Get over yourself.  You're not that much in love.  I'm out."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to dine at Mora Italian for the same reason that I assume many others do: to see if the brutally honest Chopped judge, who scoffs at overcooked pasta and gawks at raw onions, was the real deal. Well, I can say with confidence that Scott Conant doesn't mess around.

First of all, get the bread cart. Why? Two words: mascarpone butter. In a perfect world, everything I eat would be slathered with it. You may be tempted to pass, but this is no ordinary bread basket. The pasta dishes were fresh and perfectly cooked with well-developed sauces. The spaghetti pomodoro was creamy with all of the cheesy, savory notes that dreams are made of. The side dishes had interesting flavor combinations and came in surprisingly large portions. The broccoli rabe was crisp with a welcome heat, while the roasted beets were earthy and smoky. The cubano coconut cake rounded out the whole meal with its surprisingly light sweetness.

As far as the ambiance, Mora's vibe is ritzy and certainly a bit flashy. It's not necessarily my scene, but I'll cast that aside for great food and refreshing cocktails any day."}
{"text":"Mora is truly one of a kind. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of my dining experience at Mora. The atmosphere, servers, food, drinks, and decor made for a pleasant evening. The ambiance felt like I was in another city and not Phoenix.

Reservations are important if you are planning on going during the dinner rush, but if you go early in the night you should be seated fairly quickly. 

I wouldn't say Mora has a full 'Italian' menu, but they definitely adapted to the Italian cuisine with a twist.

Starters that were great..
Polenta \"Boscailoa\" - seasonal mushrooms, truffle, bacon 
This dish was amazing, highly recommend to share with multiple people since its creamy and a little heavier. 

Burrata - spring peas, pomegranate, radish, salsa verde
Delectable dish.  Mora prepared the burrata to something as comparable to Italy. Boy, did the flavors burst in my mouth and wasburrata was made to perfection.  I would love another burrata dish on the menu. :)

Homemade Pasta..
Pasta al Pomodoro - chefs signature 
The joy of eating fresh Italian-style pasta is simply the best. The pomodoro pasta is a bit denser, firmer texture perfectly paired with the sauce.

Strozzapreti - duck ragu, truffle, parmigiano
Truffle is a favorite in my palette and this dish sealed the deal. Flavorful to the max!

Ricotta & Mascarpone Gnudi - lobster and guanciale ragu
These can be described as little bites of heaven. The lobster was a little tough within this dish, but the gnudi's were amazing.

Cannot wait to explore more of the menu :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food.  Scott, you trained everyone well!  
We went for Valentine's Day and had the special menu.  There were good choices.  The bread cart is wonderful!!! We loved the sangria!  It was probably the best octopus that I have ever had!
The downside? The music is so loud that you cannot have a conversation.  I was also sitting facing west.  The sun was setting and BRIGHT!  No one bothered to lower the shades."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor- lovely ambiance and bar scene- but I didn't really connect with the menu. We did go just a couple weeks after opening. Tons and tons of potential! I loved the old Hollywood style glass they served my champagne in."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. The look, the environment, the people and the food was just to leave you speechless."}
{"text":"I normally don't like to review a restaurant on prix fixe menu, but our Valentine's dinner was so good! The bread cart is amazing as was my husband's short rib plate and my spaghetti pomodoro. I would have given 5 stars, but my dessert (coconut cake) was pretty dry. The service and ambience is excellent. We'll be back, but I'll try a different dessert next time."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere ! 
Went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't crowded nor was there a wait .

Chefs special was amazing! Sauce was awesome .. will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful and the ambience is classy. The drinks are gorgeous and tasty. Just leave your high expectations for amazing Italian food at the door and you'll be fine. It's all about looks here, people!

Whenever a dish came out, I couldn't help but wonder if Scott Conant would have lasted on Chopped with that dish or if it's a dish that he would have been proud to serve on the show if he were a contestant. Then I proceed to pretend like I'm one of the judges. Scott, you've been chopped!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The fresh pasta is as good as it gets and I can't say enough positive things about the tasting menu.  This is not one of those tasting menus where bigger eaters will debate stopping for something on the way home - you will be stuffed.  It comes with 5 courses (the amazing cheese bread thing, cold apps, hot apps, pastas and desserts).  It's done family style so you get to have some of everything and they scale the number of dishes for each course based on how many people are there.  There's also the option to add a meat dish to the mix but for me the pastas are the standouts on the menu and the additional food isn't necessary.  We've been several times and have done a mix of ordering from the menu/doing the tasting menu and have been really pleased with pretty much everything (except for the radicchio salad which isn't for us).  Plus the place is super cute."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I finally tried Mora for our anniversary dinner :) I'm really glad we finally went, it's delicious! 

For drinks, he tried the Estillo Vecchio, and I had the Il Pirata. He really liked his, and mine was great, too! I love getting rum cocktails, and this was a good one. 

We started with the Focaccia Genovese (I liked it because here you can order everything at once and they course it out for you), and we both really liked it. The bread was delicious, and the garlic and Parmesan spread was fresh and tasty, kind of buttery. It was also a really good-sized appetizer. 

For dinner, we split the Fettuccine with grilled chicken and the Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Chop \"Milanese\". The Fettuccine was my favorite - I loved the sauce, and the chicken was perfectly cooked. I also loved the whole pieces of roasted garlic in the pasta, they were super tasty. Nothing like tons of garlic for an anniversary dinner, amirite lol. 

The pork chop was really good too - well-cooked and great sauce. It was super mustardy, though, so if you're not big on mustard this might not be for you. 

Then, for dessert, we split the Warm Chocolate Cake, which was delish. The cake was extremely rich, just FYI, but very tasty. The hazelnut ice cream on the side was to die for :) we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This may now be my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  I was super impressed with the decor, the vibe and of course the food.  We started with the pate, meatballs and mushroom starters and corked some great wine off the sommelier list.  Main course pasta was perfect, and service was top notch."}
{"text":"At about 5:00 p.m. on a Saturday, our small group of four was trying to decide where to go for dinner after a visit to the Heard Museum, when I remembered that Chef Scott Conant's restaurant, Mora, had recently opened on 7th Street, south of Montebello, in Phoenix.  Everyone agreed we should try it. Knowing we didn't have reservations, I had a backup plan, but it wasn't necessary. Because we arrived for an early dinner, they were able to accommodate us, but after that, Mora filled up quickly. I recommend reservations. 

Our waiter was Mike and he did a great job. He was affable, courteous, and attentive without hovering and without those moments where you wonder if your waiter was simultaneously working at another restaurant because he can't be found. Mike did a good job of providing detail regarding various dishes. Observing Mike throughout our visit, it definitely appeared that Mike enjoys interacting with his customers; but he doesn't do it in an obnoxious way. 

We ordered calamari frito, the pasta pomodoro with meatballs, fettuccine with mushrooms, and a margherita pizza. It was all excellent. We shared our food with each other and there was not one complaint about any of the dishes.  A couple of us ordered the Sangria, which was refreshing considering the temperature outside was over 100 and it was humid. The pasta pomodoro is supposed to be the chef's signature dish and it was pretty special. The meatballs, a combination of pork and veal and fatty scraps from their prosciutto, were delicious; not dry, not too big, and resting - not bathed - in a tomato sauce that had some perfectly sized, small cuts of tomato. The pizza was very good; not great. It was above average and there was nothing to complain about.  We were too full for dessert. Our bill was $98.72. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice. On one wall are blown up images, photos, used as wallpaper-like decor, which images are of various celebrities, including a still from the movie \"Roman Holiday\" showing Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn riding on a scooter. The seats were comfortable until near the end of our visit when the stiffness of the chairs could be felt as blood circulation to the legs started to wane for all of us. The outdoor patio looks nice; we'll have to return when the weather cools to try it out. 

Given the summer monsoon weather, most of the male customers were wearing shorts and polo shirts; very few were dressed up beyond that level of attire. Most of the female customers' attire ranged from summer dresses to jeans to shorts while still looking stunning and feminine.

We recommend Mora and we'll return to try the meat and fish dishes. If I had been hungrier, I probably would have ordered the roast chicken. Overall, Mora is a good place to eat and enjoy good company."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Very interesting menu. The bread cart was novel and the toppings were delicious. Pastas were cooked perfectly al dente. The service was spot on. A great addition to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food definitely in the 5 Star category but service was not so much. We were there on a Monday night and it wasn't very crowded but it took FOREVER to get our food. We were there for nearly 2 hours!  Starving when we arrived we ordered appetizers right away. Based on recommendation of waiter we chose the faccacia de recco which is a thin pizza dough with a small amount of cheese and sea salt. It was $16 and was the only food I was not impressed with. It was burnt on some areas and almost raw in others. We also had the yellowtail crudo which was truly amazing. We ordered the pasta pomodo and the ricotta and mascarpone gnudi with lobster. Both were so amazing. Pasta cooked to perfection. I might choose the gnudi for my last meal. Note that it took SO LONG between courses and we went in starving that we polished off the entire faccacia so we didn't have roomto finish our pasta. No worries - perfect for leftovers, right?  Yeah, not so much. Our waiter picked up our plates - didn't even ask if we wanted to take it home . Stacked one plate directly in the other and off he went. I even had a full meatball untouched (the side came with 2). I can't tell you how shocked we were. My friend didn't notice what he had done and was fully expecting him to bring us our leftovers (both dishes were only half finished) but he took the check and vanished. She even looked for him for about 5 min before we gave up and left. I will give it another try in hopes that was an isolated incident. Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"I guess we ordered wrong????  We had such high expectations, and have to say the food was okay.  The space is wonderful and staff is friendly.  The bread is great and the sides served with the bread were wonderful.  I could do without the cart and the production that went along with the bread service. The Tuscan Style Chips were bland and I would not order again.  We ordered the Heirloom Tomato Salad, but it never arrived as the server must have forgotten that we had ordered it.  Sounded great.  The Ricotta & Mascarpone  Gundi stated it was in a \"concentrated tomato sauce\" it was drowning in butter.  A lot of butter! It was not pleasant for me and was served lukewarm.  The Chicken in Potacchio was fine, but not great.  A big distraction was the large bed of flavorless leeks that the chicken was presented on.  I guess I'm not a big leek fan, but found it odd that so many were on the plate.  I agree with other reviews the space is wonderful, valet parking is great, and and nice addition to 7th Street.  Prices are reasonable and there is a great wine and cocktail selection.   I'll go back but order completely differently than what I did this time.  Also, I called at 4:00 the day I wanted to dine and was told I could just \"sneak\" in as there was a cancelation at 5:00.  I arrived at 5:00 and left at 6:15ish.  There were many open tables throughout the restaurant when I left and there appeared to be plenty of servers on hand too.  Perhaps it is busy later in the evening or they keep a good supply of tables on hand for walk in customers.  The covered outdoor space was a wonderful place to dine."}
{"text":"They created a gorgeous, elegant space! 
This restaurant feels like no other in Uptown Phoenix. 
I was quite happy when it comes to food, appetizers and the dessert, though I had to ask for some ingredients from the kitchen to improve my pasta dish (it was too dry) 
So maybe that's the pasta, or maybe, I admit, I had too high expectations, that I'm giving just 4 stars (I'd give 4.5) but I'm quite sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Could actually taste the flour and foundation of the pasta. Fettuccini was remarkable; simple with mushrooms and to the point. The pasta speaks for itself. Was disappointed there wasn't tiramisu on the menu but quickly forgot after tasting the salted caramel budino. Server knew everything on the menu and it's ingredients. Stellar cocktails and smiles."}
{"text":"As expected the food was amazing. Happy hour was a great deal, the two female bartenders working Tuesday night were awesome."}
{"text":"What a great concept, Italian food made modern but they still kept the core staples. Great energy and vibe. Excellent staff and an awesome manager by the name of Jessica that helped guild us through the menu. They even have Gluten Free pasta that actually taste like regular pasta. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful new place for delicious Italian food. My lovely wife and I came here on a Friday early. It was about 430pm and already it was getting busy here. We were seated almost immediately as we had gotten reservations. The table was very near the kitchen which is open and and allows your to Dr the food being prepared. The kitchen is very busy and super clean place. We The decor is very Italian with large pop culture photos of italian life on the walls. 

Our server was wonderful. He knew the menu inside and out. He recomend some great items. We settled on:

Apps:
The Focaccia which was super thin like a tortilla. Can't recall the name but it was delicious. 

Heirloom tomato salad: very good. The vinaigrette was very refreshing and the tomatoes were perfectly ripe.

Mains:
Duck ragu pasta: pasta was perfect al dente. Small portion of duck but it's such a rich meat it's OK that they don't serve a lot. We would order this dish again.

Sausage and porchino mushroom pasta: This was my pasta. I loved it. Sausage was very flavorful and the mushroom sauce was rich and hearty. 

Peas and guanchalli: so so good. 

Desert:
We should not have had desert,because we were so full but we had to try the coconut layer cake and the carnelian pudding. Both were just ok, I'd say they were the only part of the meal that was not on point.

Overall: Food 5/5. Service  5/5."}
{"text":"This was our first time in to mora and we went for my birthday celebration so we were super excited to be celebrating. They started by telling us our table that we called to reserve was going to be an additional 15 min. When they took us to it, it was on the patio (June 3 people in phoenix Az. Hot as hell) squeezed in between two larger parties. Not happy. We waited again for a table inside. The drinks too a long time to come but we're simply delicious. I had a submarina it was yum yum yum, my boyfriend had a nice glass of wine. The food was great and the waiter did a great job explaining the menu to us, the descriptions are a bit brief. Anyway get the pasta pomodoro the chefs signature, it's divine. We will be back."}
{"text":"Brought my two clients here. We grabbed seats at the bar and were ignored and not approached by the bar tender. Another group that came in after us was also served first. After 10 minutes we decided to leave and go to another venue. Was not expecting mediocre service from an establishment like this."}
{"text":"Had a reservation 815 and didn't get seated until 915 and there was no octopus and no lamb because they ran out. Overall, the food we did order (ribeye) was very good."}
{"text":"Amazing. The place is esthetically pleasing to the eye, great wine list. My husband had the gnudi - in which he rated top 5 best things he's ever eaten. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The service wasn't what I expected, the service was slow & when we finally got it food my fettuccini wasn't what I thought it would be. The portion was way too small for a very high price. Secondly, two of my friends ordered a meal that was recommended by the sever. She asked what was a creamy pasta and he recommended a plate that was $25 dollars which is not bad for a higher quality meal. When they received their plate, it wasn't a creamy pasta as the server recommend. We were upset about that but we tought ehh why not try something new even if it's not what we wanted.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case because the food was served cold as it had been sitting for a while. The pasta & bacon I came with was chewy. As for myself that grew up in the food industry I know that that's not how it was supposed to taste. For the price, Mora Italian should have better quality food & yet alone service which is #1 key!"}
{"text":"Definitely trendy, a mix of generations, all seemed to enjoy the vibe of the restaurant. They have a nice outside patio area with a great bar. We started out with the bread cart (someone mentioned that it was way overpriced, um it's $8 bucks) not bad at all. We had the calamari as well, fresh and warm, loved it. For our entrees, we had the Pasta al Pomodoro (fancy spaghetti) with a nice cream sauce and a little kick to it, I enjoyed it. Hubby had the Cavatelli (pasta with duck meat) delicious. And we did finish off with the coconut cake, which I thought was tasty but a tad on the dry side but all in all a great experience. Service was great as well :)"}
{"text":"I feel the need to update my review because the serious problem with delays in service and errors with serving plates of food to the proper tables has been fixed.

Mora Italian Restaurant is an upscale but approachable Italian Style Restaurant with a super nice rich fun atmosphere that is very energetic. The co-owner and executive Chef is celebrity Chef Scott Conant. After two visits I found that the food they serve is very detailed and is made with highest quality ingredients. Also on both visits I found all the servers and management do work as a team to serve you. They are very friendly and hospitable. 

Now to the food.....Everything I tried was either good or blow me away awesome. So I'm torn on between 4-5 stars and would be happy to give a 4.5.

From what I tried so far - the must get plates to me in no particular order were.....

The Polenta with Mushrooms and Truffle Sugo - rich and balanced
The Ricotta Mascarpone Gnudi - a marriage of a ravioli and the delicate nature of an angel cake
The Boneless Orata - really fresh and perfect - like meals I tried at $$$Vegas
The Apple Crostata - just delicious and perfect
The Ricotta Fritters - tasty, very fresh milky cheese with some surprises and a perfect crisp crust.

The Grilled Scaloppine of Beef Short Rib differed in presentation and taste from our first visit and our second visit. Both were good but one was awesome....So I don't know what plate you'll receive.

The Chicken by itself was expertly prepared to perfection. It did melt in the mouth.. but the fennel underneath was more memorable with an unexpected great flavor and texture. Still a very good dish.

Fettuccine was good...but against the Gnudi .....the Gnudi were more special and interesting.

A very good restaurant...with a fun vibe.

I'd give a 4.5"}
{"text":"My husband and I sat at the bar last night, Sunday at 5pm.  We ordered the bread cart and 3 appetizers. Loved them all.  Excellent flavors and very fresh.  I think the cocktail prices are a little high, but the food is priced reasonable.  Love the décor of the restaurant including the restrooms. Has a great atmosphere.   The bar tenders were polite but could have been more up beat and engaging to their guests.  One small comment about the menus they presented. We thought was very tacky and unprofessional,  that they were crumpled and warn. I noticed this with other guests at the bar and the tables behind us has similar menus.   I would suggest having them laminated or put into a leather sleeve or make sure each day they have fresh new ones printed.  Not what we expected from this restaurant, especially when the owner is Scott Conant (Celebrity Chef).   Other  than that a great place and we will be back."}
{"text":"Reservation on a Wednesday night for a friend's birthday. We all arrive on time. We're told that the kitchen was running behind. Head to the bar for drinks. Three drinks and over an hour later we finally get seated. By then I was starving and slightly buzzed. All the food was great. Tried multiple pastas and the ribeye. As good as advertised.

I know this place is new and will have its issues but making people wait over an hour who have reservations and not offering to pick up a round of drinks or some snacks was poor form. If you go, make sure you don't have plans after, you won't make them."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this restaurant and most of all the service. We went here for our anniversary and waited 1 hour to get our food. Our server barely came by the table and was clearly more attentive to other customers. If it were not for a manager that came by we might still be waiting for our food. He was very nice but our server never came back nor apologized. The food was good but definitely overpriced for such small portions. We did leave full but only because they comp'd dessert. I would not go back here. The pictures make it look good but there are plenty of other good options out there as service far outweighs the rest of the experience. Only giving this 2 stars because the manager made it a little bit better. They forgot about one dish that our server probably never put in and they should have comp'd the whole meal for such a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Overall very good food, service was good, but slow.  We debated if this was intentional to create a slow European dining experience or simply too many tables for the wait staff.  Pretty sure it was the latter.  Atmosphere is great, staff all friendly and polite.  We will return."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour with some co-workers. Love, love, love the decor and vibe. Service was very good. We were well taken care of. I got the Rose Snowcone to start and I loved it but it should be served with a little spoon so you can munch on the ice. Ask and you shall receive! We got an assortment of apps, none of which we found outstanding and the portions could have been a little bigger. The pizza was good, could have use a few more seconds in the fire. I will come back and have dinner because what we had was good enough to give the place another try."}
{"text":"Fancy . We met friends here for dinner on Fri night. We made resezzies in advance which I would recommend, it was packed. Gorgeous restaurant! The patio was perfect for the great weather we are finally having (Come on, its Nov... bring it on). They have convenient valet. 

The food was great! Service was great! I wish there were more dishes that catered to my pallet of combining flavors (like salty/sweet, or clean/tangy and spicy). Everything seemed dairy/salty centered. I ended up picking the pork chop because the server recommended it. Huge portion. My husband liked my dish more than his pasta pomodoro. So I was able to give him about half and still had plenty. The cheese crisp thing was delicious. We also got a couple of veggie sides that were delicious but salty and both involved dairy (You might want to ask for the dairy on the side if you are avoiding). He got a couple of glasses of wine that were good but expensive. Overall, great experience, made me feel fancy and pampered."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Mora.  Enjoyed the valet service since parking is impossible in that vicinity.  Had reservations and waited only 10 minutes or so to be seated. An excellent selection of spirits and wines.  Our waiter Tom was very engaged and explained all the dishes we had question on. Not being too adventurous, my wife and I stuck with the Pasta Premandor and the Fettuccine.  Both very tasty and well portioned. My son-in-law had the pasta dish with calms which he really enjoyed. His wife played it smart and ordered side dishes, the pea salad thing and the asparagus variety which were both delicious 
The bread cart was interesting, but at these prices you would think bread for the table is a given.  $10.00 for the bread cart. 4 varieties of breads 3-4 slices each.  They offered a variety of toppings for the bread, but like I said, for Italian food just give me the loaf and plenty of butter.
Overall a very tasty meal, but it seemed over-priced for Italian food.  I can see where this chef is tying to include signature, unique meals, but again, I may be too old fashioned. This is definitely geared for the younger, melineal age group.  Trendy atmosphere, crowded seating, loud music."}
{"text":"Yum!
Loved it!
Took my Fiancé there for his bday dinner opening day and can't wait to go back.
We started with,  the bread cart  (which we won't be getting in the future as we feel it is waaay over priced. Good, but overpriced), then the calamari which was delicious, meatballs, and ended with a pizza. We shared it all...and then had cake for dessert which was complimentary in Celebration of the Birthday.
All in all a great experience and loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service was also really good. Wish I could say the food and cocktails were the same but can't. Went there tonight and I will never be back. Spent $85 for two drinks, pizza and two appetizers. For those prices the food and drinks should have melted in my mouth but it didn't. I force myself to eat and my drink was almost undrinkable (lemon drop)"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went here for a date night and it was so good! We started off with some bread with a Parmesan spread which was SO good, a ceaser salad and some polenta they were all really good and for the price properly sized. We then had pasta and my husband had the chicken which he wasn't too wild about but we may of also been so full by the appetizers we shared! Our waitress was so friendly she even helped make a mock tail since I am currently pregnant. The atmosphere is fun and hip but also romantic! We both Agreed we would return if not for the amazing appetizers and dessert. They also had a bunch of great looking cocktails I can't wait to partake on!"}
{"text":"Complimentary valet but bring cash for a tip.

Super nice place, great ambiance, upscale casual. LOTS of staff with lots of smiles, welcoming personalities and warmth. Great attention to detail, to include a napkin dropped on the floor - unobtrusive bend down and scoop up and provide a fresh one! NICE job!

We ordered several sides and antipasti dishes because we were anxious to taste everything!
The first three things that came were astonishingly good! Burrata (cheese similar to a soft mozzarella) with peas was so bright and yummy that I couldn't stop talking about it. Too bad I had to share it! The ragout of mushrooms and truffles over polenta was a thing of beauty and an absolute joy to eat! A beet dish that was spiced gently and served with something creamy on top was a pure delight!

Sadly, after those three things, the food went downhill quickly. Peas & guanciale (think bacon light) with poached egg was okay. The brussel sprouts were wildly overcooked with charred edges that made for a bitter after taste. 

The gnudi made with ricotta and mascarpone was, by far, the worst thing we were served. I cut one in half, took that bite and had trouble swallowing it. Instead of a soft pillow of lovely flavor that I expected, I got a mouthful of pasty mush with no flavor at all. I had trouble stifling my gag reflex with this one. The other half remained on my plate.

My companion ordered the ribeye, medium. The plate arrived looking like a jumbled unappetizing mess with 2 overcooked mushy carrots complete with full limp green tops lying over her steak like an ugly dumpster find. Locating the meat amongst the fat was difficult even though a ribeye standardly does have a generous amount of fat by its nature. So sad and so disappointing. The steak did have good flavor but was dry - maybe a hazard of ordering medium, to be fair.

I had the mustard crusted pork chop. It came with a delightful little well-dressed side salad. The mustard crust was slightly bitter, again overcooked and the chop was dry. The flavor was there definitely but the texture was below expectation.

A GORGEOUS 8 layer coconut lime cake went by and it was too beautiful not to try so we ordered a piece to go. At home I tried it and was disappointed yet again. Once more the flavor was totally there but the cake was so dry it was easy for me to stop at a forkful. If it had been light and fluffy it would have been KILLER! 

It could have been an off night for the cooks - who knows. But this is a special occasion place according to the prices, and not a give-it-a-second-chance spot.

I am a loyal Food Network fan and it pains me to write this review, Scott. Best wishes for your success."}
{"text":"The food was great. Didn't love the focaccia cheese bread appetizer (a little undercooked and doughy in spots), but the yellowtail Crudo was really nice, the pasta pomodoro was tasty, and the gnudi was exceptional. Our server was knowledgeable about wine and patiently answered our questions about the menu. 

The problem? We waited patiently for over an hour between apps and entree (no exaggeration!), and our server never even acknowledged the wait. But we were enjoying our conversation, so we didn't complain. We were pretty full after sitting so long waiting for entrees, so we didn't eat very much of the entrees and planned to take it all home. He asked if we wanted dessert, and we politely declined, explaining we were stuffed. He took our plates, presumably to box them up since over half was left and he didn't ask whether we wanted to take them. We waited 20 min after paying the bill for him to bring our boxes, but he was nowhere to be found. After walking around the restaurant looking for him, we finally gave up and left annoyed that I paid almost $200 for two people after tip, no desserts or cocktails, and he didn't even bother to ask if we wanted to take our large amount of leftovers and apparently just threw it all away. Really disappointing considering what could have/should have been a great meal."}
{"text":"This is a very cute spot, fun to hang out in with a hip old Hollywood feel. The cocktail list is interesting and the drink I tried with snap pea infused gin was tasty even if the coupe was only half full. The food didn't live up to the ambience. Our group ordered the heirloom tomato salad, the bread board and individual pasta dishes. All of the dishes were under-seasoned and no salt on the table (hate that).  Two of us walked out with bad stomach aches which, judging from past experiences, means there was way too much butter in the dishes. In my opinion authentic fresh pasta pomodoro shouldn't need a vat load of butter to be good.   I do feel like the pasta itself did have a freshly made mouthfeel to it, but I also prefer it to be cooked al debate and ours was quite soft. Hopefully they work out the kinks. With a chef of this caliber I expected the food to be outstanding- it wasn't."}
{"text":"Great food, service was very good. However our appetizer came out before our drinks (which was later taken care of) the only big con I have for this restaurant is that the music was so loud I could barely hear anything, far too distracting during a nice meal. Not sure who they are trying to attract with that vibe"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 people and had a horrible New Year's Eve dinner experience.  Due to the restaurant's inability to communicate between their employees, we ended up getting seated over an hour late 
from our reservation (made 3 weeks prior to dinner) and had to rush out of the restaurant to make it for our NYE arrangements.  Worst of all, the hostess LIES TO US, right to our face!  Zero integrity from her part.
And later when the manager came by after food was served, it was clear that he had no clue what was happening and how dissatisfied we were.

Food was mediocre due to the experience, and what looms is the idea of what could be going in the background when employees realize they can lie to the customers to get out of a challenging spot, and then get by unnoticed from management."}
{"text":"I REALLY REALLY REALLY WANT TO LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  The waiter was the best part!  He was kind, helpful, attentive, and professional!!!  The food was oily, high fat, off (scallops), and took over an hour to get to our table because the kitchen was slammed. I am not sure why every chef makes lamb the highlight of the menu????....boring!!!!  The risotto was soaked in olive oil.  (How about a drizzle next time??)  The pasta was over cooked too!  I am disappointed!!!  The music was way too loud......  I mean has Scott ever even dined here?  Nothing felt fresh, innovative, or special for the $$$$$$.  Yes, I understand this is a harsh review, I feel I need to be honest.  Don't waste your money. Try Pomo, it is relaxed, better, less expensive! (I think it is owned by the same people, but they do a better job at Pomo!). :(

Mora contacted me tonight via Yelp. The GM, Lance, wanted to know more about my experience. Prompt and professional!  Just FYI."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and it didn't disappoint. Phoenix was in desperate need for a really solid, professionally crafted restaurant, and an Italian one at that. The gnudi was completely outstanding, the bread plate was simple but delicious. My only complaint was how close the tables were. We had to move to the side pretty significantly just so the servers could wait in the tables next to us. The music was also SUPER loud, forcing conversations to be even louder than normal, so it was hard to hear my date. Otherwise, great. I'm definitely going again!"}
{"text":"So happy this restaurant is in my neighborhood.  Just had appetizers,  but what great food. Had little gem lettuces, veal and pork meatballs,  and foie gras bruschetta.  For dessert had warm chocolate cake.  Such a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with my brother and his wife and they both had their signature dish - the Pasta al Pomodoro - and it was excellent. Since I'd had the dish before I thought I'd try the Fettuccine and WOW! This was one of the single best pasta dishes I have ever enjoyed ANYWHERE. Just superb. 

We also enjoyed the Fritto Misto as an appetizer and the Manager brought out a complimentary  (SUPERB) Polenta Boscaiola that was prepared in error so we were the beneficiaries. I thought that was a nice touch and was much appreciated

Mora's Italian is a superb restaurant with great, friendly service and a terrific, cool atmosphere in Central Phoenix"}
{"text":"i really liked my meal here.  we came here last night before heading back to sfo and sat at the bar to eat while watching the oscars.  the ambience of the place is great and is super spacious.  we shared the little gem salad (YUM!) and the roasted cauliflower side.  i got the calamaretti, which were tube pastas w/ a light tomato sauce and shrimp, and my friend got the pasta pomodoro w/ added meatballs.  even the bread here was fantastic.  the portions here are pretty generous, so i couldn't finish my pasta and was able to box it up."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Mother's Day brunch, & it was Fabulous! Food was great, service was great, restaurant is beautiful! French toast, Yum! Eggs Benedict, outstanding! Slab bacon...do I have to say more? Pastries, terrific! Specialty drinks were really special! I would give 5 stars except for the volume level. The music was too loud to talk across the table. I get it, trying to create a fun atmosphere, but yelling is not fun. I'll be back, but ask for a table far from a speaker."}
{"text":"The food was rather bland and the pomodoro sauce was too acid. Prices were too high for the amount of food served. Nice ambience and beautiful and modern décor.
Will not go again."}
{"text":"Throughout the course of this meal there were ups and there were downs, but overall I had a good experience. Let's start with the ambiance. Modern, contemporary, hipster, slightly loud vibe. You can tell they are trying to market towards the younger crowd. Now let's get to what really matters, the food. Started the night with the bread car which was a little confusing to me. When I hear the term \"bread cart\" I am picturing their to be unlimited bread with this cart continuously strolling around and me getting excited every time I see it coming my way, similar to the ice cream truck driving into your neighborhood as a kid. Well, this didn't happen. The gentleman explaining all the breads and dips was a very nice guy but I just wish the car came around and you can get as many as you want. 

Next appetizers were the fritto misto. This was underwhelming. Not much calamari, more vegetables and why they served fried potatoes(basically French fries) with it I didn't really get. Octopus appetizer was salty and the stuff that came with it was not that great. At this point in time I was really needing something to make this dinner memorable. The entrees did exactly that. I got the duck cavatelli, great flavor. Would have preferred more of a truffle flavor but great pasta and duck was tender and delicious. Pomodoro was amazing. So buttery, so sexy. Sopressata pizza was great as well. Meats were packed with salty flavor and dough was nicely cooked. 

Finished the meal with the apple crostata. Delicious. Apples and pasty were cooked beautifully and ice cream on top tied it all together. So, would I come back? Yes I would, mainly for entrees though. I would probably skip the appetizers next time."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my friends birthday. It was a group of 10 girls Easter weekend on Saturday. Walked in to a super hip vibe. Very busy but not cramped feeling. It was however intimate with the dim lighting and close together seating. It's not too big of a space. I wasn't crazy about where we were seated (right next to the open concept kitchen). Usually I LOVE that but in a group of 10 girls it was hard to hear what anyone else was saying other than the girls right next to me. Let alone the waiter. 

Speaking of our waiter! What a GREAT job!!! He was so down to earth, knowledgeable on the menu, and as a bonus was funny!  He made some great recommendations. 

As for the food it was really good but I won't say great.  It was nice that they bring you bread and condiments when you sit down. We ordered Parmesan chips made in house for an appetizer and those were delicious. For my entrée I shared the prime rib with my girlfriend.  What I didn't like about that was it was cold when it arrived. It tasted good but not amazing. My friend ordered an entrée that had these gnocchi-like ricotta cheese dumplings in a cream sauce.  I tried that and it was just a little bit too rich for my taste. I did however like the fettuccine. The pasta was super fresh and the sauce wasn't too heavy. For dessert we had the mora sundae and the apple crostata. Both were really delicious and had some unique flavors and textures. 

All in all I would definitely return to this place!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Scott Conant's having made Scarpetta in Las Vegas a frequent stop when I'm there.  So, I've made several trips to Mora now, hoping for the same sublime experience.  I've greatly enjoyed the service and the food, but I have to say, each time, something has happened to make it a bit off.  Most recently we ordered pasta's to share and then mains.  The waiter after a bit mentioned all our food was coming out at one time, which was not at all how we envisioned it.  Definitely a communication issue.  When we asked to have the pasta's first, we were accommodated.  But, when our mains were delivered, everything that was ordered medium rare, was over done.  The kitchen corrected it and the flavor profiles were fantastic...the food excellent.  But, it felt exhausting to get to this point...and frustrating.  It's still a relatively new business and I trust they will continue to improve.  The drinks menu and options are truly special."}
{"text":"I wonder if Scott Conant was as mean to the chefs at his own restaurant as he is on to the chefs on chopped if the food here would be better. Went with a large group to celebrate a birthday, food was way below mediocre. Every thing was over cooked, pasta was bland and super under seasoned. I'm not even a big user of salt but this food needed it, badly. Super disappointed. Vibe in the place is great, ambience is awesome. But service didn't make up for poor quality food. ?"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant in Phoenix.  The service was phenomenal (shout out to Jeffrey who was knowledgeable, attentive and fabulous).  We ordered the mushroom polenta (my mouth is still watering) and the Spaghetti (chef's favorite and recommended to us).  You will forever be comparing spaghetti to this one.  It didn't need anything: no salt, no cheese, it was perfection. The GM was incredible as well, he moved our seat from the chilly outside to a cozy booth without hesitation and made us feel warm and welcome. Prices are totally reasonable (note I live in LA). 
 
My only complaint was the music.  It was really loud and techno/dance the entire time (we were there for a few hours including pre-dinner cocktails).  If you looked around everyone was yelling to be heard.  An easy fix though, hopefully they hear about it and make an adjustment.  The next time I'm in Phoenix I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's got a VERY informal spaghetti western feel.  The ambiance and service are more Perkins than fine dining.  BUT - the Focaccia di Recco with the stracchino cheese and sea salt was one of the most delightful things I have ever eaten.  It is so light, it almost floats, yet packed with flavor.  It's not focaccia - it needs a new name all it's own.  The burrata with winter peas is a different story.  There was a tiny bit of cheese, which looked and tasted like ricotta not burrata over a copious amount of undercooked peas.  I would not order this again.  For entrees, the signature dish, the pomodoro, was delicious.  Extremely flavorful sauce and just made pasta.  Plenty of it, too.  If I were a judge on Top Chef or Chopped I would say to Scott Conant - it was a little thick and pasty.  It needed a couple of tablespoons of pasta water to loosen it up.  My husband had the ricotta marscapone gnudi.   Like the focaccia, it floated off the plate.  Melt in your mouth gratification.  THEN came the coconut cake.  We had seen numerous plates of the mountainous cake pass by and just had to have it.  What a LETDOWN.  Not sure if our cake was several days old or if it's supposed to last like a dry flavorless hunk of nothing.  We have had the famous coconut cake at the Peninsula Grill in Charleston and it looks just like the Mora cake - But NO COMPARISON.  Better cake at any chain grocery store."}
{"text":"Service was solid.  Food was good - BUT all the meat pastas taste kind of the same.  Pate - awesome!  Octopus - awesome!  Cocktails were tasty.  Only knock is large amount of d-bags in there.  Look left, look right and you'll see a lot of entitled folks that think they're extremely important.  I feel bad for the staff.  Still recommending to people for the food and service."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here before it opens on Friday. When walking up to the door the decor and ambiance of this restaurant was trendy and eye catching. High ceilings, open space, great lighting, and attractive bar space with different floor levels. We were greeted right away by hostess and was seated in booth. The menu was spelled out good with explanations of what is in each dish. Even though I don't drink, the wine and cocktail selection is large. I had the squash spaghetti and a side of broccoli. The meal was quick and very tasty. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and catered to my vegan diet by  pointing out some options. My date also had the squash spaghetti but with a side of Brussel sprouts. We both had fresh iced tea. I will definitely be back and recommend this spot to anyone in the area looking for good eatery."}
{"text":"4 friends and I ate at Mora for my birthday last night we had an 8pm reservation. We had the following:
 
Cheese and Salumi - 10/10 the preserves and cheese/meat selection was so good! Would definitely order again

Bread Cart - 4 different kinds of breads and spreads! Delicious and perfect for the table! 10/10

Grilled Octopus - 7/10 The octopus was cooked very well but there was only 2 pieces and a mountain of peas.. not very well portioned for $17 in my opinion

Pasta Al Pomodoro- 10/10 Soooo good... I will be coming back to try EVERY SINGLE PASTA on the menu! 

Porchetta Pizza - 10/10  Perfect for sharing and well balanced flavors!

Now for the service...
Our experience with the server was lacking to say the least... she had someone shadowing her so I'm not sure if she was nervous to do that but her timing was all off.. we waited about 20 minutes to get the bill.. we waited over 5 minutes to get greeted when we first sat down and she would only check on us right when we got our food and then disappear, she wasn't knowledgeable on the menu and created some awkward moments because of it.. I'm TOTALLY willing to give this place another chance because the food is SO SO SO good, hopefully service improves and they work out those kinks. This experience seems to aim at a fine dining level and it's hard to do that when the server doesn't know/can't explain ingredients on the menu! Also it never hurts to Smile :) just some friendly advice. Overall I loved Mora and I'll be back! Gotta try their happy hour too!"}
{"text":"First of all, the building. From the exterior to the interior. Wow.  I'm not a fancy girl. I'm a 5th grade teacher from the west side. So I was a bit nervous about \"fitting\" in. And when we arrived, rang all melted away. Not at all pretentious and very fun, modern atmosphere!

Was lucky enough to get a reservation for the bff and I on opening night. And let me get this out of the way, I'm a huge fan of Chef Scott Conant. As badly as I wanted a chance to meet him, I admired him from afar! 

Ok, we sat our on the patio and even though it was a bit chilly. The heaters did a great job keeping us warm but not too warm. We started off with the bread cart. Yes. A cart filled with bread is rolled to your table. With a variety of spreads. My favorite was the eggplant tapenade. 

I ordered a sangria which was probably one of the most flavorful I've tasted. The size is ample as well 

My friend ordered the fettuccine with garlic, mushrooms, and escarole. I ordered the torchio which has a sausage and porcini sauce. After a few minutes, our lovely server informed me that they had run out. She was really apologetic and quickly suggested that I try the cavatelli with a duck ragu, truffles, and arugula. Here is where one would normally knock a star or two off. After a typical wait, my dish came out. My friend still waiting for her meal. Our server came to check on us and realized that the other dish had not been delivered. She rushed off to get it figured out.  I chose to wait for my the other dish to come before eating. This was when one of the managers, Chris, came to let us know there had been a mixup and her order was barely getting prepared. He offered to take my dish and bring me a fresh one so that they'd arrive together. I thought that was very nice of them and took him up on that offer. Chris personally delivered our meals and informed us that our meal was going to be taken care of for that mix up. Was not necessary at all. But we were very thankful! 

The food was amazing. Perfectly cooked pasta. Flavorful, fresh, deep flavors. The fettuccine had a perfect kick of garlic and I pretty much want to bathe in the duck ragu. Seriously. It was that good!!!! 

We finished off our meal with a dessert of gelato and zabaione! So fresh. Light. And super yummy. Yes. I used yummy!! 

Regardless of the longer wait for our food due to the mixup, I still give this 5 stars due to the outstanding service, and ridiculously legit food!!! I will be back soon because I have to try that torchio. And the ribeye. And the meatballs and everything else on this menu. 

In all, I want to say congrats to the Chef for bringing us a fantastic new restaurant with a take on Italian that is. Wry much needed in the valley!"}
{"text":"Mora has it going on, from beautiful decor to a killer bar and patio area, as well as outstanding service.  Still, the food, well that's the highlight of this place.  Only opened since early 2017, this place is surely a must try in Phoenix's booming restaurant line up.

Why go there:
Mainly, fresh pasta made in house should draw you there without much convincing.  But there was a lot of things to try on the menu, and we did.  If you're looking for a great atmosphere, amazing flavors in these modern Italian offerings, as well as unpretentious servers, this place hits all three.  The quality of our service couldn't be more understated, they knew when to butt in, refill your drinks, and pace your meal and everyone we interacted with from bartender to table waiters knew what they were serving.  Overall it was a top experience from start to finish and we were there for 3.5 hours, grazing for Happy Hour and then off to the full experience at a table on their beautiful patio.

Don't miss:
Well the menu changes often from what we were told, of course except for its staples.  The Ricotta & Mascarpone Gnudi was out of this world, the sweet big chunks of lobster wasn't even the best part of the dish, its delicate and fluffy pillows of joy (the gnudi) was the main star with a perfect light and flavorful sauce.  Two items antipasti stood out, the burrata and rustic croutons and the Ricotta Fritters, both different and unique.  The fois gras & chicken liver paté on a big piece of grilled country bread was  probably one of the best things on toast I have ever had. 

Tip:
Happy Hour is priced really well for what you get.  You could graze there for the an entire meal worth, or do what we did and continue at a table for the main dishes.  

Overall, this place didn't disappoint, people may first come here for the celebrity chef appeal, but clearly, the crew running this place on a daily basis has got it down.  Well done Chef Scott, thanks for giving Phoenix another gem.

Bon Ap!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for my Birthday.  I was excited to try this restaurant after all the hype with Scott and Chopped.  Well I can say now after being here that not only was I disappointed but this one of the worst meals I have had.  Chef Scott and whoever was cooking that night should be ashamed of themselves.  Thanks for ruining my birthday dinner as well.

We started with the salume and cheese board.  This was actually pretty decent but I think it would be pretty hard to mess a dish like this up.  For dinner I got the bone-in ribeye and my girlfriend got the short ribs.  My steak was served to me beyond rare and I couldn't even cut through the steak with the knife they provided.  They noticed me looking at my steak and then said let us take it back to the grill.  They then proceeded to save me the same piece of meat and was still as rare.  It was disgusting.  They took the steak back again and the third time gave me a new piece of meat.  It was cooked about medium but the actual cut of steak was not good, especially for 40 bucks.  It was not seasoned either.  My girlfriends short rib was pretty lacking either.

I bought some Ribeye from AJ's last night and showed my girlfriend how ribeye is supposed to be cooked as well as a good piece of steak.  I would stay away from this place, such a disappointment and I will not be back."}
{"text":"When I found out my girlfriend got us a table for valentines I was ecstatic. I had heard such good things and I love Italian food! So it was quite disappointing when we were seated at literally the worse seat in the whole restaurant. My majestic fire riser view in the block corner of an outside rainy patio. Oh well, someone has to take the seat on a busy night right.... it was the food and the timing that left me really sour though. The services was awkward. Super friendly a little bit to much, and very sporadic. Constantly walking by but after an hour we hadn't yet gotten our bread. (Which was the best part of the meal because everything beyond just kept getting worse.) after 2 hours our final course - flat iron steak arrived. Seasoned perfectly, a majestically medium rare on the inside but....It was cold inside and the touch. As if it had sat for an hour on the assembly line forgot ironically much like us in the corner of the restaurant. We literally just watched The staff turn tables twice before we had been fully served. I could go on and on about how disappointing the whole experience was but I'll stop here. Great hype, great location, worse $150 meal I have ever spent."}
{"text":"Took my wife there for our 25th wedding anniversary. Really nice atmosphere. Good service. Very good beer & wine selection. Loved the meat & cheese board and salad. Was not a fan of the seafood pizza as the crust was soggy. Topped off with a really good dessert. Will go back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The only reason I did not give Mora a 5-star rating was because I have had a couple of bad experiences with their customer service while sitting at the bar.

The food at Mora is unbelievable. I have 9 check-ins here and I plan to have many more. The Pasta Pomodoro is one of the best things I have ever eaten. The pasta is not only cooked to perfection, but the sauce is so flavorful. I have had other dishes here as well and they are all equally magnificent. I just love the Pasta Pomodoro so much I had to highlight it. 

I also love the wine list, decor and overall ambiance of the restaurant. I almost always have a great experience. The happy hour has some excellent specials, just make sure that you specify exactly what wine you would like even if you are ordering from the happy hour menu. Unfortunately, I didn't, and I ended up paying $18 for a glass of red wine although we were ordering from the happy hour menu. This bartender was not attentive or friendly, so it didn't come as a surprise when I noticed it on the bill. 

Overall, highly recommend Mora. Take your loved ones there - they'll love it."}
{"text":"It was alright. Flies everywhere! It was quite annoying and we sat inside far from the doors. Pasta wasn't cooked and I know al dente being full italian myself. The waitress was definitely lacking, we sat there for ten min without a greeting as she walked by 5 times and ten minutes waiting for her to take the payment when I just wanted out of there already. Those flies! Also when she boxed the left overs she threw them in the bag upside down and didn't include the spread that I paid for. Rude. Great valet guys. They were actually very quick."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I just ordered 3 Pasta al Pomodoros to go, and they were fantastic. I am surprised to report that the food was just as good at home as it has been in the restaurant. The staff were courteous and pleasant. It was nice to be greeted to a warm meal and smiling staff after a long day at work. Thank you Mora Italian!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere wasn't really my taste: it was like being inside an Abercrombie while eating. For how much I paid for the Torchio the portion was small and it was really glorified hamburger helper.Didnt taste bad but still hungry! Kind of disappointed"}
{"text":"To be honest, I wanted to really like Mora. I adore Italian food and I thought that Scott Conant's restaurant stood the best chance of delivering the good Italian food that Phoenix needs. However, I've been twice now and each time I have been disappointed. The first time was unremarkable, if a bit of a let down. The second time, I had problems. We had made a reservation for 6:15 and showed up around 6. Three hostess were working the stand but we were not immediately greeted. As a former hostess, this is was a bit jarring. We were then seated at a banquet table. The tables were so close that I was almost touching the knee of the man next to me. It was an extremely uncomfortable seating location. The closeness of the fellow patrons combined with the loud overhead music made it difficult to hold a conversation with my guest. The server was not the best. I felt rushed by him as he immediately greeted us with, \"What do you want?\" The entire service he was prompt, but disconnected and made no effort to be overly friendly. That's alright, I mean I'm not going to a restaurant to make friends, but it was the feeling that all he wanted was for us to leave was what upset me. We started with the focaccia and the Brussels sprouts. The bread was fine, but the sprouts were doused in lemon and as a result, borderline too acidic. I then got the ricotta gnudi and my guest the pasta pomodoro. The gnudi was lukewarm on the outside but the inside ricotta was cold. The sauce, which I assumed was attempting to go in a hollandaise-ish turn, was flavorless. The lobster was cooked through, but again, lacked flavor. The ragu (I assume) mixture on top was vaguely spicey, but again, the whole dish lacked a general flavor or seasoning. I was upset, given the fact that this dish was $25. The pasta pomodoro was good, not bad. However, I will not be returning to Mora on my in regard. If someone invites me, sure I might go. If someone asks me if there are any good Italian restaurants in Phoenix, I will reply, \"No\"."}
{"text":"Someday, half-stars will be invented and I will be able to give this place 4.5 stars. Until then, it will have 4 stars. Overall, this place is great. I really enjoyed everything about it aside from few minor nuances. 

I learned of this place by word-of-mouth. Of course, this place has a lot of hype, due to obvious reasons, so I knew I needed to make a reservation. I made a two separate  reservations for 7:45pm. One time, we had to wait 10 minutes. The other time, we were seated before our reservation time. Even at this later evening time, the restaurant was busy! It wasn't packed but there were more patrons than empty tables. The hostesses are always very nice and welcoming. When we had to wait, they offered us something to drink. When we were seated, the servers were prompt, friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Both times, the waiters had an answer to all our questions. The restaurant itself is super swank. It's definitely aesthetically pleasing. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Minor complaint is that the music is a little too loud. The kitchen area is pretty open so customers are able to see directly into it. Be prepared to valet park your car unless you plan on walking and driving around in search of self-parking. I prefer to have self-parking availability. The valet guys are always nice and very quick so I have to give them a lot of credit.

They serve unique Italian food creations and a full bar is available as well. We ordered the bread cart both times. They literally bring over a cart of bread and prepare a platter for us. There are four bread options and four spread options. I love carbs...so of course I enjoyed the bread. I also love meat so when they serve bread AND meat together (it was the stromboli), I was in heaven! I've tried the chicken, short rib, gnudi, pork chop and one of the pizzas. Each dish was well constructed and delectable. The meat was always the right degree of moisture. I was particularly impressed with the gnudi, although the serving size is on the smaller side. I could probably eat 2 servings of the gnudi. During one of our visits, we didn't know which dessert to try. There was four of us so we ordered one of each dessert: mora sundae, salted carmel budina, cubana coconut cake, apple crostata. They were all appetizing. The budina is a little too rich and the cubana coconut cake has a strange texture, although it is humongous and could have fed all 4 of us. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance.  Amazing bread platter/basket, it was finished in our table very quickly.  Loved the artichoke spread the most.  The fried seafood app was well done, and I loved my main course of lobster gnocchi.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Mora Italian is an incredible new addition to the Valley's restaurant scene!

Not only is the restaurant itself conveniently located on 7th street with so many other hot spots, but it's beautiful inside and out and has a super fun vibe, while still feeling casual and comfortable.  There is plenty of seating, but definitely make a reservation if you plan on going; it gets packed!

The staff I've encountered during my two visits to date have been friendly and attentive... this includes everyone from the hostesses and bartenders to the servers (Shout out to Katie who was extraordinary), food runners, and valet!

In addition to all of the above, Mora offers a stellar cocktail menu and well-curated wine list.  But the big draw here is definitely the food.  I highly recommend starting your meal off with an order of the Focaccia de Recco.  Trust me on that!  (Mora's menu supposedly will change seasonally, but I hope that the Focaccia will be a staple).

If you're in the mood for something simple like I was on a recent visit, you can't go wrong with the Spaghetti Pomodoro.  It's simple but delicious and very filling.  I also suggest an order of Brussels Sprouts.  Thank me later!

There are many other items on the menu that I look forward to trying, from the pizzas to the spaghetti squash, octopus, salume and cheese plate, polenta, etc... If my return visits are anything like my first impressions, I don't think you can go wrong.

The only thing worth noting ahead of time that could be positive or negative depending on what you're looking for, is that the restaurant gets loud.  Keep this in mind if you're planning on visiting with a large group.

The dynamic duo behind Mora, Celebrity Chef Scott Conant and Local Restaurateur Stefano Fabbri have something magical here... a winning combination for sure.  Looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"Tried Mora for hubby's birthday. It was really really good. Grilled octopus was delicious. With peroni on draft, how can you go wrong. Our server Jeff was outstanding and provided great recommendations.  Doug Ragu was out of this world. Definitely a place to try once, twice, three times. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food we had was good an tasteful. The coconut lemon cake was really good. Portions size is appropriate. The noise level is really bad in the restaurant and you can hardly have a conversation across the table. Would be difficult with a big group."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a friend of the chef (a fellow chef as well) and being that I love food I had to give this restaurant a try.  My husband and I visited this weekend for my birthday and I was not disappointed at all.  We sat at the bar and the service was phenomenal and welcoming even being late night.  Being in the industry and being particular with my food and service it is the little things that stand out to me... We started with a few sides as our appetizers: cauliflower, Brussels, and beets and recommend all three.  For our mains we had halibut and gluten free pasta with red sauce and meatballs.    I traditionally only eat fish but had to try the meatballs and they were out of this world!  The halibut was also perfectly cooked to temperature and the plating was extremely visually appealing (that is important to me when having a culinary experience).  I really wish I would have caught the bartenders name as I would like to visit again when he is working.  He took the initiative to send out a birthday sundae for me as a surprise which was sweet (no pun intended)! The decor and ambiance were also top notch! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"We've been three times and though our experience has been inconsistent, the kitchen was on fire tonight. Ordered a bunch of dishes to share among our group of four.

- Focaccia de recco- asked for it cooked a bit more since last visit it was too runny. we asked for honey to drizzle on top (as they had offered last time), but apparently the kitchen was all out.
- Little gem salad- caesar style with slightly runny eggs and salty bottarga- yum!
- Arugula sad- also very good with a sweet dresing, walnuts, fennel, and pomegranate seeds
- Black pasta- just a bit of spice and more of those bottarga breadcrumbs on top
- Feetuccine- cooked perfectly with mushrooms, garlic, and greens
- Roasted orata- delish! Whole fish, deboned, with a bit of basil puree and fregola grain
- Warm chocolate cake- a very good version, though perhaps no better/worse than others around town. I'm mean, it's gooey chocolate- you can't really go wrong!
- Mora sundae- not my fave since it came already melting. We actually didn't order this, but the waitress brought it because they were out of the salted caramel bundino

Perhaps they have some supply issues? Out of honey, one of the desserts, and the primitivo wine we tried to order? Regardless, plenty of delish options to pick from. If the food is this good every night, we could become regulars."}
{"text":"I have to say the Short Rib was mighty tasty. It was nothing like I expected though. We did the bread cart and it was a bit disappointing as the bread was served room temp, the Ricotta Fritters were very good though small portioned, The Coconut cake would have been better if it wasn't refrigerated but the Salted Carmel Budino was perfect. Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I just don't get the hype. Mora was really talked up by friends and fellow Yelpers, so it was on my must do list.  While I'd give atmosphere, drinks and service a solid 4-5, the food was a big disappointment. There were three of us so we got to order and share quite a few options - it was a virtual food parade at our table and I was the Marshall. 

Drinks were awesome: so much to choose from and a great selection of wines. This is a great place to go for drinks. Sit outside. 

Moved into a very bustling (euphemism for noisy) inside. We sat right next to the base speaker, full disclosure, so keep that in mind. 

STARTERS:
Do not go with the sprouts if you're looking to stay on the healthy side. Brussels sprouts, calamari were overly salted and I was thoroughly surprised by he oils and fats on what I thought would be a healthier option. Full disclosure, forgot my glasses and was winging it because I couldn't read the menu... that's on me. But so was the greased up version of sprouts that made them unrecognizable to vegetable lovers.

Meatballs and semolina \"pudding\" were okay but nothing to write home to grandma Concetta about. The beets were okay, but also seemed to lose all redeeming value in the way hat they're prepared...Pasta pomodoro was my favorite entree by far. 

So while the Italian in me wants to love you, Mora, the wanna be healthy and still enjoy good food side of me dominates this review.. oil and salt are the easy way out here, play around a little with your menu and I'll be back. Til then, I'll see you for happy hour on the patio, enjoying your five star swings and atmosphere. Ciao!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, great vibe, really LOUD! The tables are set very close to one another (Very European) nice because it encourages a community feel. 
Started with Foie Gras and pate and the Tuscan chips and prosecco.
Chips were soggy and needed salt. (Even with all that parm) 
Foie gras: I didn't partake but everyone else seemed happy with it. 

On to a fruity, dry, delicious Fruili. Perfect. 
Let's talk about the Mushroom and Polenta  Suga (The Star Of The Show) It was the most decadent, creamy, perfectly balanced dish I've ever had! Also, nice presentation. Do not miss it! 
Fritto Misto was crispy and delicious! Rock shrimp was a really nice surprise. 

The tomato salad was nice but the side of burrata (tablespoon) wasn't enough to share. 

We shared two pasta dishes, a slightly under al dente cavatelli with duck and the garlic, mushroom fettuccine. Flavors were complex, good but I would love to have had salt and pepper at the table. What's up with that? 

Now the chopping block...
You were out of the coconut cake! The apple dish and sorbet were fine, but I watched diners eating the cake all night and didn't get any! 

I would chop you for running out of cake and not having salt and pepper at the table, however the Suga, wine selection and terrific service gets you the save! When temps are up in the high 90s it doesn't cool off at night! Close the doors and crank up the AC! 

We will absolutely be back! Have my coconut cake waiting."}
{"text":"The service was great, the manager came up and introduced himself, but at the end of the day it's the food that should be rated and it was tasteless.  I was so disappointed as I LOVE Italian food, visiting Italy every year for the last 20 years, I was excited to have an italian restaurant on my doorstep."}
{"text":"One word octopus! This place is fantastic! I can't get enough of it! Friendly fast service and amazing food right  in the heart of Central Phoenix. It is a bis place but they go out of their way to remember you when you return. Chef Scott and his team have done a wonderful job. Our favorite is Miss Jessica that always greets us with her beautiful smile."}
{"text":"Had our anniversary dinner here and it was delightful. Cocktails to start and split the Caesar salad. Excellent! We split the porterhouse which was enough for three people. Lotsa leftovers which we used for an omelet. Fabulous dessert and a wonderful wine with dinner. Outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Great recommendations from our servers Jordan and mikael. Our favorites were tomato bruschetta, polenta, pasta pomodora and Bone in pork chop. 5 out of 5 will continue bringing friends here."}
{"text":"Samantha was an outstanding server. The octopus left a lot to be desired but the FOIE GRAS & CHICKEN LIVER PATE was amazing. I had the pork chop, great. My wife had the short rib, good. The CAVATELLI duck ragu, truffles, arugula is a must. A $22 bread cart should be unlimited. The Cubana Coconut Cake a little dispassionate, as far as taste not concept. A cake that seems like it sits in the fridge is very diner-esc. The music a little thumpy, these restaurants still don't understand that the adults have all the money not the hipsters. The decor a little contrived. Too many other great restaurants to got to. I would go back if I can find a nice corner where I'm not being beaten by the music."}
{"text":"4.5 star food, 5-star service and 4-star prices. I'll round up instead of down. Three of us for dinner. While I was parking the car, Scott Conant came over and introduced himself. So cool. Server was delightful, professional and attentive. We started with the bread cart (focaccia, ciabatta, stromboli and sourdough with 4 spreads) -- very good, a lot of fun, a lot of food (we took home 2/3 of it) and well worth the $8. We ordered the octopus as an app, but they forgot to bring it out, so the comped it for us (classy). Octopus wasn't what I'd hoped; too \"fishy\" tasting rather than the marinated/charred versions I prefer. Moving on... The pasta with duck ragu was phenomenal, the chicken in potacchio was just as good and the brussels sprouts side was as good as any we've ever had. We shared a (huge) slice of coconut caramel cake as it was so, so good. Scott Conant's daughter (4 years old, maybe) came out with the server to deliver the tab and to bring us the receipt. So charming. A great experience."}
{"text":"Definitely a first and last time for all of us that had gone last night for my sisters 21st birthday. I'm giving the 3 stars for the service somewhat of the effort made. For how much this place charges for a plate of food you expect the best Italian food to be hitting your mouth on a level that's better than any Italian place ever. Everyone in our party of 8 were blown away on how poor the quantity and lack of flavor are when it came to their plates. My brother and sisters boyfriend both had the skirt steak with a quickness and did not say once wow this is really good. I had ordered the lamb loin and found the texture to be great but flavor wise it was missing something. I don't think anyone at our table enjoyed their food enough to where they really wanted to lick their plates clean that's for sure. I am glad that I tried it only to steer people to north Italia which is far better IMO. Spending 400 dollars on our tab minimum was a joke. I'd rather spend that kind of money on a higher end place like wild fish in Scottsdale or north Italia for Italian which I don't think we would even hit their with our party size."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews seeing this place was rather popular we decided why not? Inside the decor was very neat well thought out the environment LOUD like can't even hear someone sitting across from you. The drinks were good especially the Botanista. The space in between tables inside is rather cramped making it awkward to say the least.  Service was scattered somewhat confusing not having the same server the entire meal. I had the Rigatoni Verde which pretty much tasted  like eating mushrooms only fungus tasting. My GF had the Mascarpone Gnudi which the presentation looked amazing but there must have been a shortage for lobster in the place Bc it was almost non existent for a 25$ plate. All in all portions were small for the price. Was not impressed definitely didn't have that \"WOW\" factor. Or maybe we didn't order the right items."}
{"text":"As someone who has had a crush on Scott Conant since the first time I watched Chopped, I HAD to try his menu at Mora.  My husband and I came during Happy Hour and cozied up to the swanky bar. (Love the blue chairs!)  Although I was very, VERY tempted by the ricotta fritters, I was pretty lovestruck by the strozzapreti with duck ragu, and we decided to split it.

It. Was. Incredible.

This is the pasta dish you need in your life, TRUST ME.  Now, if only I can get my hands on the recipe..."}
{"text":"Saturday night for me not COOKING in my kitchen. Looking for somewhere never been to. So I found this spot when I visited little Cleo. Good review on yelp!!!

Good cocktails menu. We ordered octopus and meatballs for appetizers they are very good. My main course was duck breast came out a little bit too rare for me, but fixed it perfect. I don't remember when last time I had Duck just because I had so bad experience of it. 

Too pricey if you comparison to the same kind of food."}
{"text":"There are few things I complain about and Mora definitely isn't one of them.   Went for brunch. Loved the ambiance and the food. Definitely recommend the meatball sandwich and the pizzette w an egg on top. . Both delicious!"}
{"text":"First time coming great place!!The atmosphere is great. Great music playing and awesome service. Not to mention the food is great. I got the bread cart and my entree was the beef, super dope. Will be coming back, also great bar they know what they're doing!! They take reservation, but bar and patio open seating."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! From the complimentary valet to the last bite of budino. Everything was so excellent.  I love the ambiance, and the open kitchen design.  We made reservations, which I highly recommend. I visited on Friday, 2/17/17, for a cocktail I had the rose snowcone.  It was yummy! Not a sweet drink, so don't be expecting that! For appetizers, we ordered the foccacia di recco, ricotta fritters, and polenta.  They brought us foie gras to the table to try... Now I am not a liver lover (I can't handle the smell) BUT I put my big girl pants on and tried it. SOOOO GOOD! Not livery at all, just a smooth savory spread.  We also wanted to try the bread cart, I know what you're thinking... Yes it was a lot of food but we wanted to try it all! The bread cart was fun, but honestly I would have been just fine if you brought me the bread board from the kitchen and not wheeled the cart to my table.  For dinner my family and I had: torchio, cavatelli, pomodoro, ricotta & mascarpone gnudi, black campanelle.  We all passed our plates around and tried each others.  I LOVED the pomodoro (moms dish) and my torchio was so delish.  I highly recommend the budino for dessert.  I will definitely be back! Jennifer was awesome!


My only complaints: the noise level is just way too loud. It is not enjoyable at all to have to shout to your server or even the person sitting next to you. 

Not sure if the air wasn't working or wasn't on, it was a rainy, chilly day outside and I was literally breaking a sweat eating dinner it was so hot inside."}
{"text":"So good! One of the best meals I've had. Environment is cute, music was good. Bartenders we're not great. But I would go back again just because of the food, seriously so delicious."}
{"text":"The wine list was extensive. The cocktails were great.  The staff was very attentive.  Brian Jarrett and Mike all checked in on us regularly.  I went with some great foodie friends and we enjoyed it all.  We had a variety of items.  I loved the Brussels sprouts and the special which was pasta with duck and truffles."}
{"text":"They certainly don't have all the kinks worked out in this place and it feels very pretentious. I went by myself at around 7:30 pm on a Friday.  The bar was packed so I asked the hostess for a table for one.  There were many open seats but she sat me at the Pizza bar.  If you enjoy dining alone isolated from the rest of the restaurant this is the seat for you.  If you like watching the kitchen this is also a great place to sit.  I don't really care for either and sort of felt like I was relegated to the corner.  I asked to move and the waiter was more than accomodating.  He tried to put me at the inside part of the bar but there was a cell phone on the bar that seemed to be reserving the space so he sat me outside which was ultimately too cold.  After some time I moved to the seat inside where the cell phone had been.  Shortly after I sat down a man came over frantically looking for the cell phone.  I told him that it had been there earlier but that when I relocated to this seat it was no longer at the bar.  Although he did not verbally accuse me of stealing the phone his body language suggested that perhaps I did.  He was clearly frustrated and angry.  I later learned that this was the manager as he was the one who brought me food.  I was less than impressed.  I eventually ordered a pasta dish with mushrooms which took about 20 minutes to arrive.  Although it could have been hotter it was flavorful.  Additionally I thought the portion was small for the price.  I really want to like this place and will probably try it again.  Some suggestions: lose the pretentious attitude, improve portion size and get the food out quicker."}
{"text":"We went for my husband's birthday. We wanted something delicious and good atmosphere. 
The atmosphere was great, low lighting, good service and a good wine list.
We ordered the Calamari with the Bread Board as our starters.
I wouldn't recommend either.

Our minds were blown by the pasta!! GET THE PASTA!!! We chose the Chefs signature dish of Pomodoro Spaghetti and the Mushroom Fettuccine.
We wanted to have another order of  the Fettuccine, it was that good. Garlicky, lots of Mushrooms and homemade pasta.

I would have given them a little more credit but we ordered a nice red wine and it arrived super cold. Unenjoyable wine experience.
If we ever visit again, we'll be back JUST for the pasta. I'll skip the appetizer and maybe try a dessert and cocktail instead."}
{"text":"Disappointedly underwhelmed. I give the design & layout if the restaurant a 5; everything else was a let down. We basically paid $80 for bread & pasta. Let's start w the bread cart-the bread itself was good & thank god cause it'd be hard to mess up bread. The toppings for the bread were all under seasoned/in serious need for salt & the eggplant was very bitter. Next up was the ricotta fritters which were good-deep fried cheese & again that would be hard to mess up. Final appetizer the meatballs-2 of them were grossly undercooked & 3 people made excuses for why it looked uncooked but assured us that they were. Also not that tasty. Lastly we shared the pasta pomodoro which was the only thing we ate that had flavor & that's because there's chili oil in the sauce. Unfortunately we won't be back. There's no need to drive a half hour when we can eat delicious Italian food closer to home. Bummer. Oh and I almost forgot, we had dessert which was completely inedible. Salted Caramel Budino, I do not suggest trying it. The service was a 3, a couple of the servers we interacted w had attitudes."}
{"text":"As a big Scott Conant fan, I was super excited to try Mora Italian!  After watching him cook and critique Italian food on TV for years, I had high expectations for his restaurant. Unfortunately, Mora didn't live up to them and wasn't the life changing experience I imagined. The whole experience was a little too basic. The decor wasn't particularly unique, I felt like I could have been in any new, halfway trendy restaurant. As far as the food, to start we ordered, the polenta. With it's mushrooms and bacon, it was the most flavorful, and my favorite, item that we ordered. We also ordered the arugula and goat cheese salad. Like the decor, this item was very basic; I felt like this salad is on every restaurants' menu and there was not anything special nor interesting to it. I was really looking forward to my pasta choice, pasta al pomodoro, with a side of meatballs. The table next to us said it was the best of the three pastas they tried, and our server recommend it! However, it was just okay. This pasta does not even come close to the similar pasta at Chris Bianco's restaurant, Tratto. But I must say, I was really impressed with our server's knowledge of wine! I picked my first glass and at his suggestion, I agreed to let him pick my second glass. I told him what I was looking for and his wine pick was spot on and exactly what I wanted!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a birthday celebration, just the two of us, and were seated in a spacious booth which I appreciated. Looking around the restaurant, most of the other patrons were squished at small tables for two so it was nice to have room to relax and enjoy our time. The décor, apart from the food, was probably my favorite part. It's kind of a rustic/industrial feel with over-sized chandeliers and wood tones and they have an indoor/outdoor setting on the far side of the restaurant with large garage doors for when the weather is cooler. We started with the meat and cheese board. It had a variety of cheeses and cured meats, olives, jams and mustards  and nuts. It was the perfect, albeit rich, start to a great meal. Honestly that could have been my meal in and of itself because it is so rich, but we ordered entrees as well. I ordered RICOTTA & MASCARPONE GNUDI lobster and guanciale ragu. He ordered the PASTA al POMODORO chef's signature. Best way to describe the gnudi: salty, cheesy pillows enveloped in the world's thinnest pasta. Then there are delicate little bite-sized pieces of lobster underneath and crispy guanciale on top with micro greens. Don't let the small portion fool you- I was stuffed after one bite. The Pomodoro was hands down the best \"simple\" pasta I've ever tasted. At first glance- nothing special. Fresh pasta with a tomato sauce with fresh basil. We also got 2 meatballs on the side, which I didn't taste but the dude approves. The pasta was so buttery and the basil was extremely floral and bright- I've never tasted basil that much in a pasta and it was amazing. We also enjoyed a variety of their wines, our favorite was the Viognier blend but they had a really interesting full-bodied red \"SCHIOPPETINO\" that had a peppery flavor to it and was quite good. The grand finale was a complimentary piece of their coconut & lime cake which was moist and not too sweet. The best part was the key lime filling it was tart and refreshing after such a heavy meal. All in all an excellent dining experience. My one complaint was that while the ambience was beautiful, I definitely could have done without the constant, headache-provoking, loud, booming bass blasting on their speakers. It made the restaurant feel like I was standing in the middle of a dance club rather than enjoying a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I had seen this restaurant mentioned in places new to Phoenix so I decided to head there for dinner when I was in town for work. I was really looking forward to indulging a bit. While the waiter was superb (I think his name was Francisco), my fettuccine was blah. It lacked excitement and the flavors were really dull. I'm totally down for fettuccine that isn't as creamy, and feels a bit lighter, but this version did not hit the spot. I almost asked for something else but found myself too exhausted and needing to head back to the hotel. Would definitely try something else if you head there as this dish was not \"it\". Sexy atmosphere, though, and great wait staff."}
{"text":"A great visit again to Mora Italian and we tried some new dishes. I grew up dining on lamb during the holidays so, I had the chef's lamb dish this glorious night. I haven't had lamb so flavorful and tender before. Tender vegetables and a beautiful presentation which I enjoyed so much with my friends. Heirloom Tomato Salad as an appetizer is wonderful and to have mouth-watering, red aromatic tomatoes which look and taste homegrown like these in a restaurant is refreshing. House made pasta which I tried as a Primavera that my wife ordered is a fare I'll have on our next visit. My friends had drinks from the bar which they loved and I drank a frothy latte. 
 The service is so fast and friendly that we felt right at home, Mora is a very comfortable place to be! I usually don't do this, we spent two and a half hours at Mora visiting together."}
{"text":"Went to this spot for a friend's birthday dinner. They do complimentary valet after a certain time and the hosts were so friendly and welcoming. The ambience of the establishment was beautiful. They had a nice open patio and the weather was perfect. Our server was very accommodating and gave great recommendations. The food was so delicious, I was quite surprised. I ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My husband and I came here for dinner with two other friends. We made reservations for 7:30pm on a Saturday and arrived around 7pm. The place was alive and packed. Beautiful structure and ambiance, almost like you are in a fun Chicago/New York style place. You forget you are in Phoenix (or the southwest for that matter) when you walk in...  We went to the bar when we arrived since we were 30 min early. Fantastic prompt service. We had a drink and the. Headed back to the host stand around the reservation time. We were seated around 7:40pm and had Samantha as our waitress. She was lovely. Ordered the pasta pomodoro, heirloom tomato salad and octopus. Definitely Delish! Will return!!!"}
{"text":"Being big fans of Scott Conant and the Food Network, Mora was a must try on our list. We made reservations for an early Valentine's Day dinner and loved every minute of our experience. The modern and welcoming atmosphere was great along with the friendly and professional staff. However, the real star was the food! This is Italian with a twist and we loved it!!! In addition to having one of the best lamb dishes I've ever tried, the homemade pasta dish we ordered was amazing. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Best italian food I've ever had! Had the octopus appetizer, duck ragu, and ricotta mascarpone gnudi with lobster. Highly recommend all of these!"}
{"text":"Very very nice place. Enjoy the atmosphere the service was great the menu very good. There were a couple of items on the menu that seem to be confusing, specifically the short rib. We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Been here five times and never had a bad experience. Scott Conant did himself out with this place and thanks for bringing it to Phoenix. The pastas are all amazing and haven't had a bad item or drink at all.  Will be heading there again real soon! Thanks Mora!!"}
{"text":"I went I'm with high expectations and left feeling happy. Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge huge huge Scott Conant fan I'm sure just like along with a lot of other people writing a review. I have been telling my husband for almost a year now that we have to come here we have to try it out. And my lovely husband surprised me Friday night with reservations to have dinner here.
We had a 7pm dinner reservation and wow this place was packed just tons of people all age ranges. The inside of the restaurant is so awesome very hipster looking. I don't remember our waiters name or anyone but the staff has the most amazing customer service everyone was so friendly and helpful.
So let's get down to what we are for dinner! We didn't do the typical order an appetizer and an entree we both did the sampler which I recommend everyone getting. It's all of Scott's favorite items off the menu so you can sample everything.  To start it comes with the Focaccia di Recco which was like a giant cheese pizza with no sauce. It was full of flavor and empty cheesy goodness. Next it came with our salads which were the Radicchio & endive salad and the Burrata... I absolutely loves the Burrata the eggplant mixed with the mascarpone cheese was such a nice combo. After that it was on to the warm appetizers and my husband loved these we got the pork & veal meatballs and the polenta \"boscaiola\".. he said it was the best meatball he ever had in his life and for a first time having polenta he said both were so tasty and didn't feel too heavy in the belly. Ok so after all these yummy treats it was on to pasta. So here is where the staff told us to just take a bite and get it bagged to go. Which we total recommend that is the best way because remember we still have a giant pork chop coming and desserts. As for our pasta it came with Pasta al Pomodoro and the Black Campanelle.. we no joke took one bite and had the waiter bag it. Lol! And let me tell u all we heated up that pasta the next day and it tasted even better then Friday night. And our main dish was the Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Chop. This pork chop was the size of my face still with the bone in. I have never had a pork chop that big in my life and I'm so glad my husband and I shared it I would never of been able to finish it on my own. So we waiting a few and had dessert.. it comes with a chocolate lava cake with hazelnut ice cream along with a watermelon sorbet. Holy crap both were soooooooo goood I would go just for those 2 things lol. But no i would go and eat and eat and eat again. 
We didn't end dinner until about 9:30.. so u are feasting for a good 2.5 hours and it's worth every penny.. so go enjoy and try it all so you can say you did and it's all amazing I'm so glad we finally came enjoyed dined and ate."}
{"text":"I have been here twice already and I don't live close at all. Both times I have been blown away by the food and overall experience. The restaurant is beautiful and so well designed. The cocktails are fantastic and well designed. Someone definitely knows their craft at that bar and the whole staff has it together. Very cool to see a celebrity chef/owner walking around as well and he seems like a very good guy. 

The food is the star here though, and specifically the pasta. The appetizers are great too. The burrata app is so special especially if you like vegetables. It is a small amount of fresh burrata cheese with a celebration of vegetables all around it. Just a wonderfully conceived and balanced dish.   The octopus was excellent, as well as the meatballs. All of these are very unique and well worth trying. 

The duck pasta and the spaghetti pomodoro were both exceptional. They give  a whole new definition to pasta in my opinion. The spaghetti is so simple and yet so unbelievably good. These are the only ones I've had so far and I can't say enough about them. I haven't even had an entree yet but can't wait to go back. 

This is a place I want to eat at again and again and again. Foodie heaven."}
{"text":"Had the SOPPRESSATA pizza, veal and pork meatballs and the STROZZAPRETI.  All were very good. The meatballs were a little tough and the pasta a tad under cooked. They were harder than the usual \"aldente.\"  The prices were pretty high but this is to be expected of a Scott Conant restaurant.  Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I would not say the food is horrible. But certainly was not great. Then add the price, disappointing.  The underwhelming service just made matters worse.  

Won't be back... too many choices in town.

*** Update, General Manager immediately reached out.  Talked on the phone, he was appreciative of the feedback.   Invited us back to give us another try... \"do not want you walking away with a bad experience\".  Appreciate his concern."}
{"text":"Truly a perfect meal.  Scott Conant absolutely delivered a spectacular dining experience.  Pomodoro actually exceeded the hype with great flavor and al dente pasta.  Duck ragu was a nice variation, along with classic meatballs.  Fresh fish was expertly grilled and the sauce work put the dish over the top. Service was attentive, friendly and informative.  The waiter offered to split the portions for us when appropriate.  We will certainly be back on a regular basis.  If you are looking for large portions of bland pasta (with a take home meal) at cheap prices, this probably isn't the place for you.  This is fine dining in an unpretentious environment."}
{"text":"Literally \"Hot and New\", hot off the press! This swanky downtown location is B E A U T I F U L. Drinks are tasty and the food was great! The atmosphere was fun and young adults."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations of this place, considering the owner is featured all over the food channel. Anyway, the food was good and the service was average. The sticker price in comparison to the overall experience could be worthy if you go in not having expectations. I did get Free dessert for my birthday so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Ah I wish I could give this a good review. The first element to touch on is definitely the sound and atmosphere! I felt like I was at a club in Old Town with the DJ, not a restaurant. The music was extremely loud and totally inappropriate for a restaurant. I'm 31 and still not even into something like that, especially when the decor was amazing.

Anyways for the food I was hoping to die over--the taste and pasta.  The starters were under seasoned as the rest of the meal. Although the octopus was cooked well/ there was no real sauce/ seasoning.  Also the \"foie gras / chicken liver\" was a false advertisement and very underwhelming. To be honest, I felt it was all very disappointing lacking salt, among other things. The \"bread cart\" which they thankfully comped- was underwhelming,
Then bread was all stale and made worst by a very dry and boring build up by a very green waiter. The sauces were alright but not above average. 

We got 4 pasta dishes for our main entrees and they where all dry. A \"rabbit ragu or any ragu\" should be cooked throughly and be rich in taste. All the other dishes were unfailing similar.   

The server was nice and attentive but never did ask how we liked the food. We actually did not finish 3 of the 4 main dishes. 

The final thing I will comment on is the way the dessert was handled. It was my mother's birthday so they sent out a desert without asking what we preferred. We were delivered the coconut cake (not bad.). Small trouble is that 2 of the 4 people at the table are allergic to coconut. Nobody asked.  Communication would have helped this. Even with leftovers we chose to not take any home.


Phoenix metro has many above average restaurants this is definitely not in that company. Mostly very disappointed. We left wondering what they were trying to do with a DJ during the dinner hour. Food was extremely overrated and the whole scene was confusing."}
{"text":"Food was underwhelming and we tried all the recommended dishes.  Loved the atmosphere and service was acceptable.  Wish I could say more but after all the hype it was an unmemorabke food experience.."}
{"text":"Good service from start to finish. Sarai served me at the bar. She was knowledgeable and friendly. Had the pasta with sausage and mushroom ragu on her recommendation. Pasta was perfect. Took the carmel dessert to go. Also great- possibly a little over salted. All in all a good experience. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since before it opened. My fiance surprised me and took me for my birthday much to my delight. Im torn between 3 and 4 stars. But will definitely be going back and will update my review (hopefully with more stars).
 We started with the meatballs, brussel sprouts and the bread cart. All three were delicious. The meatballs were tender and flavorful and the semolina underneath of them was delicious along with the pesto. The sprouts were to die for. I would go back just for those. The bread cart is a carb lovers dream. Not the greatest value as it is just bread and some spreads but we enjoyed it all the same. 
For entrees we order the skirt steak and the torchio pasta so we could share. The pasta was very good with the sausage and porcini ragu. The steak on the other hand wasnt bad but i wouldnt order again. 

Cant wait to go back and try the pizza and more pasta dishes.....and to get more meatballs and sprouts."}
{"text":"Mora has won us over- hearts, stomachs and all. There's no two ways around it, our first visit during opening week left a lot to be desired. The GM, Chris, has a great way about him and set us up with a reservation for a return visit that made us totally forget anything was ever awry (didya notice the 5 stars and not a measly 3 or 4, yeah.. THAT good.) Our second server Renee was perfect, the ambiance was killer and as mentioned the management is the best I've encountered anywhere. But come on- you and I both know you're going for Scott Conant's food. So here's what I know- in order of deliciousness:
*Gnudi- my version of carb heaven. Little puffy pillows of happiness in the most delicious sauce known to man. I've said \"this is a must\" in previous reviews; I was lying. THIS is a must. 
*Brussels- so frickin good. Perfectly roasted with a great chili bite with savory bacon and sweet onions. 
*Sopressata pizza- Awesome crust, sauce and cheese but lacked salt (odd because you'd think sausage would be salty but no sir).
*Little Gem Lettuces- a REALLY good Caesar salad. Our server convinced me to leave on the fish egg breadcrumbs and I was pleasantly surprised. 
*Ricotta fritters- tons of flavor but way too rich for me. One bite was plenty. 
*Bread cart- a good starter but nothing I'd ever crave or consider ordering twice. 
*Seafood pizza- PASS. Great crust and sauce topped sparingly with seafood bits and no creamy element or sauce to bring it together. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Mora. Thrilled you're here!"}
{"text":"Oh BOY...

Not even sure where to start on this one. Overall place is a HUGE disappointment. After being to several scarpettas in the country (by the same chef), expected so much more out of here.

Pastas were very BLAND, GENERIC tasting, MUSHY, with portion sizes so large, they were very unappealing (Buca di Beppo comes to mine). Drinks were overly sweet and inconsistent, when ordering the same drink.

Service was almost non-existent. We were not offered any appetizers to try out, no food suggestions, and definitely no mention in site that the pastas are MORE than shareable. 
Music was blatantly loud - with a very weird music selection.

Décor - even though it is very 'modern' - nothing seemed welcoming or comforting about the place. Seemed overdone. See / chekout POMO on scottsdale road for same theme done WAY better.

I'm not sure what this restaurant is trying to be. Is it family style cooking, a bar for after work get togethers, or a date spot. Truth is, it does not nail any one of those to any extent - and we will definitely not be coming back here.

Sorry Mora - you were a huge let down. I'm trying hard to find anything positive to say about the place and drawing a huge blank...there was not one part of our meal, salads and desert included that was 'enjoyable'.

The only reason this place is a two star for me and not a 1 is because it wasn't completely 'repulsive'. Just nothing to take home about.

Proceed at your own risk"}
{"text":"We had a good meal at Mora Italian but there were a few hiccups with their service. We arrived a little early for our reservation and were told to wait and after 20 minutes past the reserved time they still had trouble finding us a table. I finally found some tables myself and was told they were being held for a large party 90 minutes from now?? Anyway, we did finally sit down and then it took a while for our server to notice us. The place was packed so it must be tough to notice when tables change. After we got settled we had a nice meal and the food and drinks were really good. We tried several of the pastas, all were great - Pasta Al Pomodoro With Meatballs, Strozzapreti, Ricotta & Mascarpone Gnudi, and also tried the Beets & the Summer Squash Side dishes. Portions were smaller so no leftovers but that was fine with us. We went on the weekend and there is DJ in the dining room so with the packed house and the music it is very loud."}
{"text":"My sister is a huge fan of Chef Scott Conant (because duh, who isn't?) and chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner...4 months before her actual birthday. It was our first time dining at Mora and the food was just as amazing as we knew it would be! They offer a family style tasting menu that the 6 of us decided to try and it was absolutely perfect. Not only were we able share all of the most popular appetizers, pastas, and desserts, but the best part was that we actually got to enjoy time with each other rather than having to stress about what everyone should order. It was the best of both worlds. Our sever, Victor, was extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu and even suggested wine pairings for every course of our dinner. I'm also not exaggerating when I say that his choices were on point. This is one of those restaurants where everyone from the waitstaff to the managers (who are all incredibly friendly...and attractive) works with a combination of urgency and finesse that you're rarely exposed to when you go out to eat. Especially when the place is as packed as Mora was! I can speak for everyone in my family when I say that the genuine hospitality we received from the moment we walked in the door to the time we left made for one of the best dining experiences we've ever had. It truly made my sister's birthday one for the books. We will definitely be back! Pasta al pomodoro for life!"}
{"text":"So far I've only had drinks at this restaurant. It appears to be a nasty establishment as the waiters use the restroom with there aprons on. This type of nastiness is unacceptable. I'm still contemplating whether to order off the menu. Beware of the dirty waiters."}
{"text":"Would not go back.  Salty food we thought.  Mediocre service as we had to wave down people when Waitress didn't come. Charged for second iced tea ( in Phx, really?) No Caesar salad available and no fois gras available. Lovely building and nice bathrooms."}
{"text":"To the point- 

Best aesthetics and design,  best Italian food, best service, super cool vibe.  A absolute must try dining experience.  Good job Mora!  See you next time.

{"text":"I have a feeling Mora will become a favorite for many people in Phoenix. After one visit, I'm totally sold on the place.

We went on a Sunday night and it was packed. You'll need reservations for sure - we booked a couple weeks in advance and 8pm was the earliest time available.

To start we got the bread cart and the ricotta fritters. The fritters came out first. They were small but very flavorful. A good start to get the palate excited for what was to come. Next came the bread cart - 4 kinds of bread with 4 different spreads. All the options were good but I loved the Stromboli and the garlic spread.

I chose the fettuccini for my pasta and was happy that I did, I loved it. It's pretty much like eating butter in pasta form. I don't think there is anything lo-cal about this dish, but that's why it's so good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce combined with the garlic and mushrooms made for a meal that was so flavorful and very rich. It's easily one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had anywhere.

The atmosphere was more casual than I expected. We dressed up a little and didn't feel out of place but jeans would be acceptable too - the servers were in jeans. The music was upbeat and overall the vibe was energetic and fun. I really enjoyed the experience and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Was so excited to find this place! We had my good friends birthday dinner here..unfortunately they lost our 10 person reservation and we had to end up sitting at the bar. (1 hour later being offered a table) We ordered drinks and the one drink I ordered they were out of. Normally, I wouldn't typically care but after losing my reservation it was just disappointing. The bartender was great to say the least. I think the hostess' need to be a little more accommodating instead of making the customer feel like they are wrong or make them feel like they're wrong and never made the reservation. 

The food was good but not worth going while being treated bad by the first people who make the impression of the restaurant."}
{"text":"A group of us 5 friends wanted to try Mora Italian and we were able to get a reservation in for today for dinner. After hearing a lot of good things about it, I was excited to come in and enjoy a nice meal with a group of my best buddies. 

The Good: 
- location, location, location. I know, it's a cliche but with Mora they really got lucky with this location on 7th street, as the whole area is booming. 
- I can't speak for my friends (they seemed to have enjoyed their food) but here is my feedback. I ordered the endive and Raddichio salad, and I am no fan of bitter vegetables but I took a risk and boy I was glad I did. I would eat that salad every day if I had a chance. The raddichio was delicious and the dressing in that salad was spot on, it balances the bitterness of it and complemented the endive as well. Top choice for me. I also ordered the Torchio sausage, porcini ragu. While it was not the wow element in my experience, I still liked it. I guess I was expecting something different. 

The bad:
- a great restaurant and a great location, yet they did not have CÎROC peach or even regular CÎROC vodka. I'm glad however they had kettle one as it is my go to vodka of CÎROC was not available.
- when we placed our orders, it came all together (which is great, and we had literally 3 food expeditors plus the server at our table delivering the meals, but it was somewhat chaotic as the expeditors didn't know who ordered what. May be each seat should have been numbered and meals assigned to tug number in the system, just an idea. 

The ugly: 
- I'm glad to report that there was none. I love the place and a big fan of the food. Would definitely give it another try and next time order the dessert as well."}
{"text":"I ate there for the second time last night and left just as dissatisfied as the first time. While the restaurant is beautiful, with a great vibe, it doesn't make up for the lack of attention to detail in the kitchen."}

The service was great and very hospitable but the food left a lot to be desired. We ordered the bread cart, grilled octopus, veal meatballs and polenta to start. The bread card was mediocre; meatballs and polenta were pretty good but the octopus was unforgivable. It was extremely chewy. Octopus is a dish based on technique and this was done completely wrong...we were barely able to cut through it unfortunately. Next we ordered the margarita pizza, gnudi, heirloom tomato salad and roasted beets. The signature margarita pizza was quite bland and had minimal basil to be found on it. The pomodoro sauce was under seasoned and overall bland. I remember watching Scott say you can judge a restaurant off their margarita pizza because it's simple ingredients done right or wrong...unfortunately this was done wrong. Gnudi, beets and salad were ok yet underwhelming. Really wanted to love this place....had a whole night planned with friends to enjoy it but don't anticipate coming back. I realize I'm not an official food critic but as a paying customer who enjoys eating out I (and the other members of my party) were not impressed."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in the entire valley. Love their homemade pasta and premium cocktails. The service was exceptional, as well as the overall dining experience to celebrate my 25th birthday."}
{"text":"I came here by myself for the first time and had no idea what to try! SO, I did what any single lady does and I ordered the Tasting Menu! Best decision I ever made! Its 55 bucks and you get 5 courses, chefs choice of course. They kind of told me what could be on the menu but it was a little different and way better. You were able to try a little bit of everything and it was all fantastic! Worth every penny and I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals (Italian or otherwise) that I have had in Phoenix. Everything was superb- from the service to the ambience to the food. We were lucky enough to be there on a night when Scott Conant was there. He was very charming and graciously allowed us to take a photo with him and our group. Don't miss the bread tray. The bread and accompanying spreads were a highlight. The heirloom tomato salad was amazing. Halibut special was perfectly prepared.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe I have eaten at a little too many New American cuisine spots but this place did not wow me. I heard the greatest things and expected this place to be up there with Hanny's or St. Francis butt was left slightly disappointed. Service was good, nothing wrong there. Interior was a bit more sports bar-y than I expected. The food was good but nothing that blew me away. I would group this place with Culinary Dropout and North Italia"}
{"text":"Loved it.. pasta pomodoro is second to none.  Scene is beautiful service is on point and happy hour rocks.  Go go go and then go again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Although a couple of our dishes were on the charred side. The beer was on the higher side at $7 for a small serving. The service was pretty bad. The waiter while friendly ignored us for the most part. He kept walking past our table even though we had empty glasses and empty dishes. Had to flag him down to get another drink. Didn't bring dessert menus and then took a long time to bring the check. I was a server for many years so I know that the one bad waiter is not representative of all the servers there. I didn't like that I had to valet park, just made eating dinner there more costly."}
{"text":"I took a friend to Mora Italian last night and had an uninspiring dinner.  The tomatoes in the $15 heirloom salad that we ordered were mushy.   The Marguerite Pizza was cold and consisted of a crust, some tomatoe sauce and runny cheese.   The chicken dish I ordered was good, but not terribly substantial.  Our server was not particularly available nor attentive.   Perhaps the newness of the restaurant is the problem and I should return.   But after paying $53 for the meal (before tip) even with the cost of the pizza removed from the bill, I won't be returning soon."}
{"text":"Scott Conant's Mora is one of those restaurants where, if the service and kitchen are on, and if you know exactly what to order, the experience can easily be a full-blown five-stars. In my original review when they first opened, that's exactly what I gave Mora. However, in many of our experiences, after returning multiple times and getting past the \"honeymoon phase,\" these opinions often change. And this is one example where things tapered off a bit, so I've revised my review to reflect more of an overall opinion of the restaurant.

Mora is loud, hip, sleek, and lively. It's one of those places where you really have to be in the right mindset in order to dine here. The thumping music can be rather offsetting, originally being so bad that I could feel my booth shake to the beat. Over time, however, things have kind of leveled off a bit to where you can actually have a conversation without yelling.

The starters are mostly hit or miss. Some salads are better than others, but there's a lot of inconsistency on their generosity with certain ingredients. One notable instance was ordering sprouts that were mysteriously missing the lemon vinaigrette, as well as an endive and radicchio salad that lacked the parmigiano. For this reason, I suggest choosing very carefully.

I really like their bread cart. Actually, it's no longer a cart, but just a \"bread board\" that they prepare in the back.  You're given a variety of bread, including one that includes smoked salami, which is spectacular when combined with their butter and various spreads. If you want to take the leftover bread home, be sure to stress that you want it boxed up. They ignored our request once, which further fuels my theory about these Italian joints being all weird about people saving their bread.

For other starters, the veal and meatballs are a great choice. The stand-out favorite though, is probably the polenta, which includes seasonal mushrooms, truffle, and bacon - and I usually have no interest in polenta.

For our main entres, I've had the gnudi. Topped with a bit of sauce and packed with a combination of mascarpone and ricotta cheese, these \"pillows\" of flavor, as they are often referred to, do not disappoint. The pomodoro (spaghetti) is absolutely spectacular, aided by their creamy and buttery tomato sauce. It's probably the best offerings out of all of their pastas and dare I say, even gives Chris Bianco's spaghetti a run for its money.

Sticking with the pasta family, the fettuccine, which includes mushrooms, garlic, and escarole (not to be confused with escargot), is also very good - with the mushrooms exhibiting great quality. My girlfriend loves the cavatelli, which includes duck, ragu, arugula, and black truffle. Allow me to elaborate on that last ingredient. This is not that pungent food-perfume (i.e. truffle oil) that so many diners and chefs are obsessed with dumping on their pastas and pizzas. No, this is legitimate black truffle shavings, which are something completely different. The truffle shavings, used ever so sparingly, provide a subtle compliment to the already superbly tasting flavor, while not exhibiting that powerful stench and flavor that overpowers so many dishes that use oil. All local chefs should take note.

Their pizza? Not so impressive. Despite being co-owned by the guy who is responsible for Pomo, it's not quite a duplicate. Ingredients are okay, but crust is extremely spongy and doughy, which is in stark contrast to the charred and flavorful crust we've become accustomed to.

I have a love/hate relationship with Mora's dessert menu. It always seems to be changing. Their best offering was a Cubano coconut cake, baked with a whopping fourteen layers. It has since been removed from the menu - much to the dismay of both myself and other diners from what I've been told. I was told it was too complicated to make - which is probably why they prefer pushing easier desserts out, like the budino and warm chocolate cake that I could obtain at any other restaurant in Phoenix. Until they bring back the coconut cake, your best bet is probably the Mora Sundae - just be sure they don't forget the crumbs. Once again, there are some consistency issues in the kitchen.

Over time, the prices have slowly crept upwards, which is kind of annoying. However, in the end, I still really like what Mora is doing. When it's good, it's really good! And although not everything is perfect, it's definitely a place that I like returning to on a regular basis. 

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Good pasta...Tasty drinks... and fast service. Cool spot for a date night. Valet parking can get full so take a uber if you can."}
{"text":"This is a very bright spot in an already great city for Italian cuisine. We enjoyed an evening of great food and service with two other couples. Starting at the bar, the cocktail menu was interesting and varied. The bartenders, though quite busy were attentive and helpful. I ordered a Boulevardier, which was served up quickly, professionally and quite tasty. 
When all had arrived we were moved to the long high top near the kitchen. This table gave a great view of the kitchen action but from a comfort perspective was a bit on the warm side. Likely because we were 15 feet from the kitchen. 
We started with the bread cart and ordered a couple of items from the antipasti menu. The polenta with mushrooms & truffle sugo was phenomenal ($14). One order was enough for 3 people. Also from the antipasti menu we chose the grilled octopus cici ($15). The octopus was perfectly grilled. 
For my entrée I had the Cavatelli with duck ragu, truffles and arugula ($21). Absolutely delicious. I did not have to search for the duck in the dish as there was ample chunks of deliciously prepared duck throughout. 
The wine list had a number of excellent choices that didn't outpace the cost of the food by 150%, which is something I have really come to appreciate. It tells me that the restaurant cares about their patrons full enjoyment of the meal. 
Last, but not least, Jeff was a fantastic server. He was very attentive, helpful and knowledgeable. He and the rest of the wait staff were terrific. 
Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"This my first Yelp review, I felt compelled to write a review after our service at Mora. We had reservations and they were running 45 minutes behind schedule, no apologies or comps for how late they were, even after telling our waiter. The Manager seemed more interested in figuring out who broke water glasses than managing the most important of her job, customer service. The server we had was slow and ineffectual. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant was the food, the pasta pomodoro was outstanding."}
{"text":"We had high expectations since we absolutely love Scott Conant's other restaurants. Mora did not disappoint and went far beyond our expectations.  We tried 4 different cocktails and they were all delicious. The produce was fresher than angering we've had lately, and the fish was cooked to perfection. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night during their soft opening and had a very good meal with great service.  Overall great selection on the menu and all of our food was very good.  On the positive side the Caesar salad was excellent and the pork Milanese was very good.  In addition, the bottle wine selection was a really good value considering the overall cost of dinner. 
A couple of negatives were the seating by the outside patio was very cold, our table was not leveled and some of the prices seemed slightly high (not a deal breaker but something to consider). 
Overall I will absolutely be going back and trying out some different menu items and this is another great addition to the North Central dining options."}
{"text":"Magnifico!! Start with the Tomato Bruschette. Then order the tell whomever you are with that one of you will order the Pomodoro and the other will order the Ricotta Gnudi. When it arrives they will bring you each a plate and you can split them so you each get a taste of the pasta and the cheese ravioli. Enjoy them with a bottle of wine and finish with the caramel pudding. You will thank me later!"}
{"text":"I dined here with two of my friends and we were very excited to try this place as we like to choose a new restaurant to indulge and get dressed up. First we arrived and they were behind on our reservation which wasn't a big deal figured it was busy but it was pretty slow due to the holiday weekend. We were seated in a great spot to look at the restaurant but we were then greeted by a gentleman server who offered to start us with waters then about 15 mins later a woman showed up stating she was our server and no water still. We were pretty easy since we had all looked at the menu long enough we knew everything we were getting. We ordered the beard board and ricotta fritters for starters and then three entrees the duck and lobster pasta and then chicken. We let her know we wanted wine with our entrees as we wanted to wait to put those in. About 15 mins later three entrees showed up Luke warm and before the apps. We were starving so we started just eating it and finally the server came by as we were almost done and realized she must have forgot something.  We told her we still wanted the apps so those finally cane out Andre got our wine after our entrees too.  Now we have no water and want dessert once the server comes bs Lee put in the coconut cake and ask for more water.  The cake comes out quickly and no forks so we asked the food runner who was very snotty about it and she goes to grab them and dagger she drops them the server comes running over with some too. The cake was amazing and the best part of our meal. I mean the food would have been amazing too if it was hot or we actually saw our server after to let her know before we had dived insincere the apps came after the entrees. I had been talking this up so much and the very disappointed with the whole experience. I work at a restaurant as do the  other two guests I was with so we notice many things and know that a server should give the guest a great experience as your working for your tip. No manager came by."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 4.5 star option because this didn't quite live up to 5 stars but it was close. 

Service is good but leisurely. Like the other reviews say it's pretty loud so a little difficult to carry on a conversation. 

The food was AMAZING. Very memorable. 

For drinks we all started with a different cocktail. All delicious. 

We went with 8 people and didn't get the whole table to commit to a tasting so we created our own for 6 of us. 

We had: 
Country Bread
Cheese and Salumi 
Frito Misto 
Veal and Pork Meatballs
Argula and Goat Cheese Salad
Radicchio and Endive Salad (SO GOOD) 
Brussel Sprouts (SO GOOD) 
Cauliflower
Pasta Pomodoro
Torchio (everyone's favorite) 
Gnudi 
Flat Iron Steak

Portion sizes were satisfying. 

Overall an incredibly satisfying meal. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"After Long quick trip to so cal wanted something new to eat & friend picked mora on 7th? Forgot to ask how got name ?  Great atmosphere very high ceilings , big windows , comfortable booths , fun Italian inspired modern design . Split a pizza , salad , pasta , seafood beans in bowl. Sorry will try to come back to identify names of dishes. I like the spicy pizza others didn't. Pasta was rich very good. Salad with pomegranate refreshing . Seafood bean salad fresh too. Late Sunday the bar was cool but quiet . The 2nd server Brian had good energy , first server efficient didn't hear her name the fun music was a little loud. Across from culinary dropout the yard might be a new place to check out probably more intimate?"}
{"text":"Tomato bruschetta. Sounds plain and boring, right? No. This was like the most THE most delicious of tomatoes and ricotta and radish sprouts on grilled bread. Absolutely perfect with a glass of wine. The focaccia genovese was fresh, light and heavenly. 

My husband had the Torchino, mushroom ragout with sausage and said he could've eaten a bucketful. I had the lobster gnudi. Y'all. Lobster and guanciale? I'm in. All day. 

Lovely dining room, and absolutely fabulous dining staff and an extensive and well curated wine list. 

My only complaint would be is that the road noise with the outdoor seating is super loud. Otherwise? Absolute perfection."}
{"text":"Mora for the win!!! Beautiful decor, Beautiful food, Beautiful service! Given it's a new restaurant they didn't have shades yet... So when my wife and I were about to start our meal the sun was in my eyes. No big deal, why? The manager & a server stood in the distance to block the sun so we and others could enjoy our meal. There was nothing wrong with this place. To top it all off...... Scott Conant and his family had dinner next to us. Well done guys!!!"}
{"text":"As a New York Italian, Mora is insulting. Think Guy Fieri taking Arizona diners for a ride. It's faux culinary and as horrible as Babbo, just pretentious, hardly culturally Italian and stupidly expensive. In the last 8 months, I've given Mora three opportunities. The last, sadly, was the worst. 

My Lord, a $10 bread basket with four types of bread (each soft and tasteless) with - wait for it - SPREADS!!! Chris Bianco just collapsed at the notion. I cringe that an Arizona diner thinks Mora's caponata in anyway represents the Italian eggplant dish. Watch the movie \"The Big Night\" and you'll understand. The caponata was criminal. Okay, the short rib meatballs as an happy hour \"go too\"!!! They were hard on the outside - unrecognizably something mushy on the inside - and dog foodishly creepy tasting. Little baby shrimp in the Fritto Misto - see Red Lobster. The menu is about 60% Italian and the rest high profit money making items. Pumpkin Soup?? Try any myriad of classic Italian soups, please!!! 

Phoenix will never get to the next level as a culinary town like its sister cities until our diners know the difference between honest and respectful Italian Chefs and those Food Network stars preying on the underexposed while capitalizing on their fame for money alone. It's shameful. Let's not be Branson, Mo. Support the homegrown talent here . . . Bianco, Tomaso's, Tutti Santi, Christo's,Giuseppe's and many more."}
{"text":"First visit to Mora. So many pluses like the homemade pasta and fried octopus starter. Very good wine and cocktail options. Only drawback was the wait time for service after we received our drinks we waited 20 minutes to order food. That being said, once the food arrived we decided it was worth the wait. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Should have gone with my gut vs server recommendation. Pasta was fresh but the Pomodoro didn't pair well with the overcooked, dry, lukewarm veal meatballs.

Maybe we went on a bad night, if Fridays at 9pm are bad.

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great service. It was my family's first time here and the staff was inviting and professional. Lorenzo, our server, was knowledgeable about the menu and friendly. He made us feel at home. We will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  this is a review of brunch only - I love this restaurant for dinner, happy hour. We made reservations for brunch for my sons birthday.  The restaurant was half empty. We waited 20 minutes for waiter to ask about drinks. We found the brunch food average.  My eggs Benedict were bland.  My husband thought his French toast was tasty, although very sweet. Just feel like dinner is spectacular and brunch is an afterthought.  I'm hoping management ups their brunch game!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. I want to start off by saying that our server was 5/5 and our food was also excellent! But we'll get to that.

The reason for only 3 stars was because they seated us in the bar. I honestly wouldn't have minded had we walked in, but when someone makes a reservation a few weeks in advance and lets them know it's their anniversary, they do not want to be seated in a loud bar with music, tv's blaring and people standing around your table. Please take note, hostesses. 

I can't remember our servers name, but he was perfect. We started with the bread board which was delicious! My husband then ordered the Strozzapretti (duck ragu) which we both loved! I, then ordered the Veal & Pork meatballs and Burrata. Both were absolutely delicious. The server and delicious food made up for our complete and total lack of ambiance. But next time, I will ask to not be seated in the bar."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hype about this place. My girlfriend and I love Chopped and Scott seems like a very cool, nice guy, so we decided to check it out for her birthday. 

First impressions - atmosphere is stereotypical modern restaurant/club vibe with loud music and contemporary style. We don't explicitly have an issue with that but I was hoping for something a little more cozy, personal and intimate, which it is definitely not. Tables are very close together; I could've easily tried my neighbor's food. 

Service was way under expectations also. Drinks took a long time to arrive. After receiving an appetizer salad I was never checked on, even with an empty wine glass. I intentionally set my silverware to the side to keep it for my main entree, but the server cleared it anyway, which I didn't think would be an issue, assuming he would replace it before dinner arrived. He did not. My girlfriend and I shared our entrees with one fork for 5-10 mins as the food got cold before I finally was frustrated enough to grab a random staff member to get me a fork, as our server hadn't been back yet. 

The saving grace of this place was the food. My spaghetti pomodoro was absolutely delicious and my girlfriend got the fettuccine dish, also very good. 

However, there's clearly quite a bit of work needed in streamlining the staff and service overall; I was hoping for an amazing experience at a restaurant owned by a favorite and highly revered Chopped judge and left disappointed. I still have faith they will pull it together though and we may return in a while, hopefully after the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Great local craft brew on tap, a diverse wine selection (by the bottle and by the glass) and the food was spot on.  Scott, the chef, was there and was a very nice, engaging guy.  The bread cart is a must and the 5 of us all had pasta and each one was great.  The salted caramel italian pudding was insane......truly the best dessert I have ever had.  The prices were very reasonable for this type of upscale establishment and atmosphere - we will be back for sure the next time we are here visiting from Colorado."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Mora Italian. Our group had a 7:00 reservation and were promptly seated. Two of us started off with a Sangria Mora. A nice, light way to start the meal.

We again ordered the bread cart and everyone enjoyed it immensely. Next was the Salume and Cheese platter. It not only had some excellent salume and cheeses, but also had some wonderful chutney with toasted almonds as well as an excellent fig jam. The highlight of the platter was a small pile of thin sliced Iberico Prosciutto, which many consider to be the finest in the world and which I would not dispute.

Next came the Frito Misto and the Octopus. The Frito Misto is served with a squeeze of lemon which is perfect with it and the Octopus is so tender that one cuts it with the side of a fork instead of with a knife. Our waiter suggested that we try a new dish that was just put on the menu - Mussels. They were truly amazing - sweet, tender and swimming in a sauce that was so good that I soaked bread in it and took it home with me!

The Burrata was, to be honest just fair, and could have done with a nice drizzle of good olive oil on it, but the Gnudi were obviously made in heaven and transported to our table. If I were on death row my last meal would be a double portion of the Gnudi.

We ordered the chef's signature dish which is the Pomodoro Spaghetti. The pasta was very obviously hand made and the pomodoro sauce was absolutely wonderful with just a hint of spice added to it.

We also ordered a Margherita and a Soppressata pizza, but were too full to eat them and instead took them home.

Service was excellent, as was cleanliness. If nothing else, a visit to the bathroom is an essential visit, as they are like nothing I have ever seen anywhere else. Each person has their own, private, individual bathroom!

New items ordered this time were the Mussels, the Salume, and the Spaghetti Pomodoro.

Dings - same as last time - the music is much too loud, often drowning out conversation at the table and requiring the waiter to repeat things for us.

5 Stars"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Mora! I've been in a few times and have yet to be let down (not that I would expect to be!) By far my favorite thing are the veal & pork meatballs, simply perfection! Be sure to have a reservation on peak nights, this place is the hottest thing in the valley right now! My favorite drink has to be the Rose on tap, it is the best rose I have ever had. I will be back soon! (Be sure to try the bread cart as well, you won't regret it!)"}
{"text":"The place is kind of \"a scene\", which I didn't expect (loud, fast-paced music, loud yuppies in cocktail dresses, etc). The bar had a row of TVs which took away from the expected atmosphere. We sat at the kitchen counter which was a lot of fun and it also meant no wait for a table. Service was slow for us and less attentive. Overall, the food was decent. Fried ricotta balls were on the bland side. Margherita pizza was above-average and reminiscent of Pomo but the crust was not as good as theirs. Fettuccine pasta with escarole and mushrooms was garlicky and delicious. My wife's sangria was great. My first glass of wine was the Etna rosso. I don't recommend it. It didn't have the unique and funky ashy (volcanic) and minerally profile that I was hoping for. Second glass was the Brunello. I was so excited to see that a restaurant was offering it by the glass! Alas, these wines typically need an hour or two to open up. So I didn't get too much out of it."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to my first visit. I'm a big fan of the food network and Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, my visit had major flaws. First of all, the courses were far too long in between, which can be understood next, the atmosphere was dark and \"cave like\" not very warming to view finally,the food itself was not well composed or executed and a balance of  brightness lacked in most of the dishes. The dishes were heavy to the palate. So, I gave it a second chance and most concerns from my first visit did improve except the dishes were heavy and needed an overhaul. On a good note, the pizza was lovely and done very well."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype around this restaurant but it's only Ok. It's pricey for the serving size. The bread cart is just bread and some spreads, I'd rather go somewhere that gives you free bread. Pasta didn't have a lot of flavor. Everything we tried was super bland. The wine selection however was amazing. I'd go back for a happy hour for sure."}
{"text":"Went opening night-what a blast! Scott was there which was cool. Spaghetti-delish. Brussel sprouts-really neat take on them. Yum! Bread cart is totally worth it too. Loved it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"When Mora first opened, I thought the service and food were excellent.  What a contrast to the experience we had Friday night.  The menu prices have increased significantly. The food was good, but the service was disappointing.  The server introduced himself and pointed to his \"team\" member, indicating that they now work in teams now to ensure excellent service.  The server did a good job taking our order--but seemed to disappear after that.  The other server never checked on us.  Our food was delivered by food runners.  I had the Pasta Pomodoro--my favorite.  I wanted grated Parmesan on top, but no one offered this time.  Our server didn't check on us until my last bite. He was hanging out on the patio laughing with other servers and the floor manager.  With our table full of dirty plates, I had to waive him down to get the check. He took the credit card to process payment.  While we waited for him to bring it back we watched him converse and laughing with another server. Mora had several tables available and more staff than customers.  At this price-point, they should be executing excellent service. We went to Mora that night because Hillstone had a 30 minute wait. When we left, I regretted that we didn't go there instead."}
{"text":"So wanted this to be awesome. Not so much. 

Pros:
Decor is lovely - real attention to detail
Pizza had a nice crust and a tasty sauce
Hubby loved the coconut cake - I did not
Nephew loved the budino
Bread from the bread cart was pretty good
The servers were very friendly

Cons:
Pasta was really undercooked 
Duck bone in the pasta dish
No salt and pepper on the tables
The $15 tomato salad was in desperate need of both salt and pepper 
Same salad was really mushy
No attempt was made to make up for the bone in the pasta dish
It is a rather pricey dinner so \"meh\" just doesn't cut it"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian reataurant in PHeonix - hands down.  Was there tonight with friends and enjoyed the most flavorful pasta, shared a ribeye steaks with delish deserts!  Exceptional service, great environment and delicious food.  5 stars all the way around!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first was great! Food was solid and the female server was so helpful and nice. The second time was last night and it was pretty poor. Food was good but the service is where they dropped the ball. We had two waiters and they were not in sync. We order a nice bottle of wine and appetizers then the second waiter tried to talk us into a tasting menu and the vast majority of the stuff we wanted wasn't on it. They forgot my moms wine and had to be reminded a few times. One of the waiters also broke a glass right next to our table and just left the shards. I had sandals on so I had to be careful when leaving. They also forgot our cauliflower side for the entirety of the meal. Once we reminded the waiter he said oh whoops, we won't charge you for it... Well thanks...  Lastly, they never asked if we wanted desert, which we did and just handed us our bill. We had an 8pm reservation but if they didn't want us to be there for a entire meal then they shouldn't have let us book an 8pm reservation. All in all the meal minus tip was in the mid 300s and so with all the other restaurants in town I wouldn't  spend $$ here again. There's too many other good options with great service."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Great vibes, beautiful space, amazing food, friendly staff. We loved this place. A bit pricey but worth the special night out.

Valet parking is nice too. Haha."}
{"text":"Good food and good serve!  Not sure if it lives up to some of the 5star reviews but it's good.  Everything about it feels very FOX concept.  Lamb loin was very good,  you can taste that the lamb is good quality.  Had the tuna crudo app which was also very nice. Service was good wine list was a bit on the steep side in my opinion but there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that we went early (4:30 or so) on a Saturday after fasting most of the day, so that could have impacted some of the odd service and atmosphere factors.

Food: 5 Stars. Totally delicious and surpassing our expectations. To Drink, I had a Buffalo Rassa, and GF had a Southside. Both extremely fresh and refreshing. Could have drank them like candy. They weren't very strong, but I don't personally need that in a cocktail.
For appetizers, we ordered the Grilled Octopus and the Heirloom Tomato. This was a perfect pair, with one being light and zesty, and the other being rich and smokey. The octopus was tender and ensemble complimented the meat perfectly. The Heirloom Tomato salad slightly edged out the Octopus in our esteems however, as the shallot vinaigrette with fresh basil was simply amazing.
For our pasta, the Pasta al Pomodoro was lauded to us a must-try, so we did. The sauce was very unique, having a light quality even though you could taste that this was something stewing with love for a long time. It was a great sauce overall, although I found it just a touch to salty. GF was in heaven however.
For a Main, we went Lamb Loin. It was succulent and tender. Definitely a dish crafted with thought and care.

Service: 4 Stars. Very attentive and welcoming, but lacked the level of knowledge I would generally expect from this caliber of restaurant. I imagine our server was just a bit new, but I think for a place like this it would have been reasonable to have a training waiter with her. 

Atmosphere: 3 stars. Very attractive place with good decor, but the music selection was mind-bogglingly out of place. I like \"Take On Me\" as much as the next guy, but 80s pop would not be my go-to selection for an upscale Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"First timer. 

Traditional spaghetti was very flavorful and the sauce was a little sweet with a hint of pow! 
Ordered the beets based off the rave from our waiter. He was spot on. They literally give you a huge bowl of them with pumpkin seeds and some type of green. I could do with out the green or maybe even less since it was completely saturated in dressing. 
Apple dessert is \"eh\" tastes like you're eating pure sugar. The presentation was awful and the portion was minuscule. I told the waiter my thoughts and he took it off my bill. Said he didn't want me to pay for something not of quality. I appreciated the gesture - although all I was sincerely doing was giving feedback. 

I had the sangria and it was typical nothing unique. But I did also try the submarino drink and that was fantastic. 

I would go back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying Mora since it opened as we are both fans of Scott Conant. The food was superb and perfectly plated. The grilled octopus was absolutely perfectly cooked but overall the dish was served lukewarm. The polenta and mushrooms were also amazing! Scott's signature pasta was even better than expected and my expectations were high. The gnudi was also superb. 

The overall experience was, for us, marred by the \"trendy\" concept which resulted in an very noisy atmosphere with diners packed into tables barely separated. This is not a romantic setting nor one that's conducive to conversation. In fact I now know too much about the diners at adjacent tables. 

Access by car can be tricky and time consuming as 7th Street is a major arterial and turning into the parking lot from Southbound 7th is nearly impossible during heavy traffic hours. 

It was great to go and we loved the food but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great little spot to wine and dine. Food was flavorful. Atmosphere was posh. Service was spot on. Parking was tight but adequate. Patio was perfect and packed. Definitely on the dine again list!"}
{"text":"Unbearably LOUD.  Could not relax, the decibel level was stressful, conversation without yelling impossible.  Food mostly good, although the fish was dry and fishy.  And I would give it three dollar signs.  Even if the food was superb, which it was not, I wouldn't return & I couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try Mora since it opened but last night we finally made it in for my birthday dinner. Jenny was our server and she was phenomenal! She was very knowledgeable about the restaurant, the food, and the chef. She really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. My boyfriend wanted to order the south side but it was no longer on their menu. Jenny had the bar use the last of the snap pea infused gin to make him one. I had the sangria and it was delicious. The atmosphere at Mora is great but everyone wants to hear about the food. Everything on their menu sounded fantastic but we ultimately decided on the pork and veal meatballs, grilled octopus, pasta al pomodoro, and the lamb loin. The meatballs were flavorful, perfectly juicy on the inside, and a little crisp on the outside and the semolina pudding is to die for! The grilled octopus was cooked to perfection - they had a great char on them without being over cooked and the bacon and peas complimented them beautifully. The lamb loin with the anchovy gremolata and kale was a perfect balance of flavors and textures. But the pasta al pomodoro is heaven. I could eat it every single day for every single meal for the rest of my life. Lastly, for my birthday Jenny brought out the Mora sundae. After our meal we thought we didn't have anymore room for dessert but with one bite of this sundae it had us going back for more until it was gone. Bottom line: go to Mora, order anything, and you won't leave hungry or disappointed."}
{"text":"We visited in April and again on Sunday evening. Let me start with the detail from our first visit. Basically, the service was way off - multiple small things (our server was nice and friendly). 
- we were mostly ignored. 
- had to be reminded to bring things (including some of the food we ordered).
Food was decent and we put it down to the restaurant being relatively new and the fact that we were a party of 6.

On Sunday evening we waited at our table for 23 minutes before deciding to leave. We were ignored by our server. There are so many great restaurants in Phoenix now, there's no reason to endure such terrible service. 

For the record, we tried to remember a time when we walked out of a restaurant - we couldn't."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. The food was also delicious. Try the Brussel sprouts and the sangria."}
{"text":"The ambiance is superb and grand, definitely a place to impress guests! The wine list is extensive with a lot of them from  Italy. The grilled Octopus appetizer was so soft and flavorful. The homemade pasta dishes where to die for; however, the clams weren't plentiful. Top notch services from the hostess to the servers."}
{"text":"I seriously didn't know food could make me so happy. From the atmosphere, to the service, to the drinks, Mora didn't miss a note! Phenomenal restaurant!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to go here last minute on a Friday night. We lucked out and were able to get reservations on OpenTable for 8:30PM. I was expecting the restaurant to be packed since that was the only available time for a reservation. To my surprise it was not packed. There seemed to be a DJ playing near the bar but his music wasn't blaring or extremely loud which was very nice. We started off with a drink and burrata. The burrata was excellent, it came with peas and what seemed to be salsa verde drizzled over top of it. I've never had that combo before and was pleasantly delighted how everything came together. I ordered the Pasta al Pomodoro since it was the \"most popular\" dish at Mora and came highly recommended by our waiter. I have to say the dish did taste great but I wish there would have been more flavors or spices in the sauce, it was just a bit bland. The noodles that are in the dish are great. I would like to go back and explore the menu more."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Mora on opening weekend.  My husband and I started out with the Amalfi Sour and the Barrel Aged Boulevardier from the cocktail list.  Both drinks were on point and was a great way to start the evening.  We shared the Grilled Octopus Ceci and the Polenta next.  Both were extremely delicious! We then shared the Cavatelli and Torchio.   We finished the night with Cappuccinos and the Coconut Cake.  We are excited to have Mora in the hood and can't wait to come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY!! What kind of sorcery does the chef have going on in that kitchen!!!? 

I'll start from the beginning. They have complimentary valet, which is awesome! So don't forget to bring cash! 
Then walking into the restaurant was magical. They have such nice and modern decor and paintings. The bar is so nicely set up and the patio is beautiful. The employees are nice dressed and well-groomed. They greeted us very pleasantly and took us to our table within 5 mins of our arrival even tho one person of our party had not arrived yet. 

After we received our waters and ordered wine, We started off with the bread cart. They had 4 types of bread and 4 types of oils/dips (Read the menu for what they were). They were all soooo good!! The tables fave was the mascarpone. Then we got the fois gras(sp). I don't way duck anymore but I tried a little bit and didn't like it. Not because of anything the chef did but because I'm not into cat food. We also got the Tuscany style chips. Those were underwhelming. They were just chips. We thought they were going to be seasoned better or were peppers but they were chips. Then we got the calamari. That was good. They have a good amount and the calamari is tender and perfectly chewy. 

For our main courses, my friend got the orata, which is a whole fish. No head and it was deboned. I got the chicken potacchio (sp... I'm not Italian!), which was a well done chicken on a bed of roasted onions and sun dried tomatoes. It was really good and the chicken wasn't too \"chickeny\" If you know what that means. I tried the orata, which was amazing. It was perfectly juicy and the skin was crispy but not burnt. So so good!

After we were done with our main courses, we were sold on the coconut like rum cake. They brought out this huge slice of heaven on a plate. I took a bite and I kid you not, angels appeared out of nowhere and blew beautiful trumpet melodies and there were birds singing! I mean it was magical. I've never had a dessert so delicious! It's definitely my fav cake ever! Even if I didn't like the food, I'd go back just for the cake. Mmmmmm my mouth is watering as I think out of it. 

Service was great. Our waitress was a cute young girl who was very knowledgeable with the menu and drinks. That was refreshing because most of the time waiters don't know much about the menu let alone wine pairings. And a bonus was that right before we got our main courses, a nice guy came to our table to check how we are and shook our hands. He turned out to be the manager. How personable and caring is that?!

I'll be back, Mora."}
{"text":"Great new Italian place on the neighborhood! This was more authentic than I expected and we were blown away. We ordered the pasta pomodoro and margherita pizza. Great pizza, cute place and very close to everything."}
{"text":"The latest hipster restaurant from a Food Network star does not disappoint! The wifey and I went on a Saturday night and this place was happening! If you didn't already have a reservation, you probably won't get a table. The vibe was strong, music was loud and everyone was having a grand ol' time. We even got to meet owner while waiting for our table...my wife was like OMGosh, that's Scott Conant. I found that some of the food parings were a bit eclectic (I.e.: steak with sumac rub and squash vinaigrette), but everything we ate was of high quality and palatable. Highly recommend doing the \"bread cart\" appetizer; for $10 bucks you get to try like 5 different butters/spreads. I put this place on my top-10 places to take out of town guests for a good time or date night. Tip: If you sit in the patio, don't do it towards the end of monsoon season (August), as the mosquitos will kill an otherwise great experience!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe (beautiful restaurant) and their tribe (servers/bartenders/management).

The menu is unique...we enjoyed the Polenta Antipasti, Wood Fired Chicken and the bacon Brussels Sprouts were mouth watering. My mom is from Italy and thought the homemade pasta was incredible. I can't wait to go back to try the pizza. Their house version of an Old Fashion, Estilo Vecchio was perfect!"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner and loved it! The vibe was cool and trendy and I loved the decor. I had the rose snowcone and it was so good I was obsessed. We ordered the meat and cheese board to start off with and it was huge. The only downside was that they didn't explain what each meat and cheese was when they brought it out to the table. My husband ordered the chicken for his entree and it was a very generous portion. I had the pomodoro pasta and it was amazing! The sauce was to die for. Super classic and simple but amazing! They also gave us a complimentary dessert and it was delicious! They could improve on the service though because it was a little slow."}
{"text":"First time here.  I took a picture of the dining room just before things got busy.  Beautiful decor.  It starts to fill up around 5:30.  Lots of people sitting at the bar getting happy.

Food:
- Focaccia Genoese 5.0 stars - fresh and garlic on the side was so good 
- Pork and Veal Meatballs 5.0 stars - nice flavor and sauce
- Pomodora 5.0 - chef's signature dish a must try
- Fettuccine 5.0 - so good nothing left on plate
- Side Chicken Breast 2.0 - way overly salted (too bad)
- Roasted Cauliflower 1.0 - so spicy you couldn't eat it (what a waste)
- Banana Sticky Toffee Pudding 5.0 - enough for two to share
- Riesling from Germany 5.0 - cold and crisp

Service:
- Good service however my only complaint was at least 5 different people (servers, hosts, managers) stopped to ask how is the food?  Hey, give me a minute to enjoy and then I'll let you know.  I found myself waiting for them to come and go before I could take a bite.

I'd go back for sure.  It's pricey but sometimes you have to treat yourself."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd say, \"you have to try this spaghetti!!\" but you really do. AMAZING. And then the staff is just great. The bartender Toby, kills it and everyone else we have worked with has been great. Food. A+. Style. A+ Drinks. A+."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place 3 stars as opposed to 4. First, let me say, it wasn't because of the food. The food was actually really good. Hats off to the chef that night or sous chef. I had the lamb loin which was very tender and flavorful. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also liked the free valet service they provide. The decor was nice, had a blend of modern and traditional feel. It was really loud though. Not the exact place I would take someone on a first date. It was definitely trying to be like the Seattle hipster scene while trying to maintain a sense of fanciness as well. It's really a lost identity to me...but I'm not an expert...

Anyways, where my issue comes in is the service. I had set up a reservation at 9pm on a Friday Night using the open table. Everything was set to go. I met my friend there at 9pm and I checked in with the hostess in the front. 

She told me that reservations are a little backed up right now, it's about a 20 minute wait. I told her that that was fine. She said the bars open if you guys wanted to get a drink first. So I agreed and as we were walking there, I stopped the same hostess once more and asked her, \"Do you want me to come back in 20 minutes and check in with you or are you going to come find us at the bar?\" 

She said specifically, direct words out of her mouth, \"I'll come find you.\" So my friend and I head to the bar order a few drinks. She had wine and I had a wood reserve on the rocks. After 40 minutes has passed, I told my friend I'm going to check on our table because this is getting ridiculous. 

I walk over to the same hostess and reintroduce myself for the third time (she asked me what was my name all three times). I told her when my reservation was supposed to be, how I even spoke to her directly, and she said \"oh that's right. We've been trying to contact you, but couldn't...so we assumed you left.\" 

Hmm...strange...I specifically told you I was at the bar. I specifically asked her if she wanted us to come check in again or would she come call us when the table was ready. Her response was \"oh we dropped a lot of reservations today.\" 

1. Does that mean it's acceptable to continue dropping reservations? Well...I already made the mistake before, so all other mistakes are okay. 

2. Sounds to me like they need to fire these workers and get someone competent who doesn't drop reservations then...

3. What's the point of a reservation then? 

4. I really did not like the excuse, nor the inaction to alleviate my frustration. For what's supposed to be the next hip-high end trend in Phoenix, falls flat on its face on service. We were highly disappointed. And although the food was good, and the waiter who served us showed a bit more attention, I still couldn't get the sour taste of the hostess out of my mouth. 

I would not go back after that incident regardless how good the lamb loin was....Maybe."}
{"text":"Been waiting to come here since I saw blue prints. Came with my friends on grand opening, was empresses. Came every week after till end of July. Came back in HEAt of Summer and SURPRISINGLY Came here for dinner and saw that the menu had changed. Saw the radicchio salad had changed. I found something else for dinner But my wife
 ordered the duck foie gras. I'm ok with menu changing but portion changing because it's summer? I'm a little worried about the existence of this chief. I was just in New York City in Greenwich Village and been there 4 times this year and haven't seen a single 5* change  the amount of food on an item during the summer, specially after they just opened? Is this another Phoenix Burn-out? Your already cutting food on the menu ? Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This is a brand new place. The atmosphere is beautiful and unique. The food is impeccable. The chef greeted us and the general manager was very accommodating.  We loved it! The service was friendly and efficient. It is luckily just around the corner from us so we will be eager to  go again."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing. Meatball app, goat cheese salad to start. Wife and I split the pork chip and pomadora pasta. Service was exceptional (Mikhail -- you are one of the best I've ever had. Well done). Atmosphere was great. And walking distance to several hot spots. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came to this outstanding restaurant last week with my family. The whole family really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant and we thought that the hospitality our server Victor, showed us was some of the best we've ever received! Mora is a must see."}
{"text":"Had a great meal, the scallops were phenomenal and the chef's special pasta was just as good, don't forget to leave room for desert. The service and experience puts this place on place I'll come back to over and over."}
{"text":"Yum!! The food here is amazing! The decor was great and was so excited after obviously watching Scott Conant on TV over the years. The only hiccup in my opinion was dirty silverware was given to me twice which is quite honestly just a dishwasher and server error. We started out with the bread cart and man are those tapenades delicious! It was a little awkward having the kid making the plate for us to describe each and every bread in detail, but I get what the idea of that is. The winner of the night was the pasta I ordered, black campanelle. Talk about tasty. It was a explosion of flavor and so unique. Pasta was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend got the cavetelli with duck ragu and it was simply stunning also. An unexpected hit was the long beans in a chili oil, damn. I will be craving this dinner again. Topped the night off with the almond cake and it was so yummy. Crumbly good to eat with a cup of coffee. I wish this place was local to me!"}
{"text":"Best pasta in Phoenix! Excellent service and ambience. Definitely make a reservation on weekends."}
{"text":"Wow. As a self-respecting foodie, I came here with high expectations. But even those were exceeded at this great establishment. 

The experience started off on the wrong foot, as we were sat at our least favorite type of table (table for 2, turned sideways so you ate sitting far across from your guest, plus people can be seated on either side of you). We were okay, as it wasn't busy and either side of us was free. Fast forward, and we actually moved seats to sit in front of the kitchen, which was a show in it of itself. Definitely recommend if there are just 2 of you. 

We had the tasting menu. I cannot rave enough about this choice. It gives you a nice sampling of their offerings with generous portion size. The desserts honestly put this over the top for me. 

Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Scott Conant did this one right for sure."}
{"text":"Simply - WOW! So I had dinner tonight with my husband and cousin from NY; who frequents many Italian restaurants in NYC from holes in the wall to fine dining so when we decided to go here for dinner while he was in town I was on pins & needles. We started with the burrata, bread cart, and polenta! The burrata served with snap peas and salsa verde was delicately delicious, while adding a great contrast to the bold flavor of the polenta with roasted mushrooms and crispy bacon!! Then on to entrees where 2 of us had their hand made pastas and the other the skirt steak. The wrap up we enjoyed espressos and the warm chocolate cake that had a Nutella gelato that was absolutely fantastic! The meal was second to none and my husband and I will definitely be back! As for our cousin, the New Yorker, he was wildly impressed and grateful for the truly Italian experience...right down to the details like his black sambuca being served with the traditional 3 coffee beans! Health, Happiness, and Prosperity! SALUTE!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. My mom said she did not enjoy this place, particularly the pasta, but I had wanted to try it. Last time she was in town we went together, and I have to say she was right.

Drinks, appetizers, and sides were all delicious. I had the rose snow cone, which was perfect after a 30-minute drive in a hot car. We also ordered the ricotta fritters for the table and those were fantastic. Crispy, but not greasy, and the ricotta filling was perfect.

For my entree, I wasn't too hungry, so I ordered the Scallop Crudo off of the app menu. I was a little weary, as someone next to us ordered fish and it smelled very fishy. However, the crudo was super light and fresh tasting, and I really enjoyed it. We also had a side of the Brussel Sprouts, which I'd highly recommend.

However, the pasta was a major let down. I don't remember which one my mom ordered, but it was very forgettable. It was bland and the noodles weren't great. 

How can you be an Italian restaurant without decent pasta? For that reason, I'm going with two-stars."}
{"text":"Updated review! Finally had a weekend to come back here after a few months after my first visit. I have new favorites guys!!! 
Starters: PORK AND VEAL MEATBALLS (omg whatever the meatballs sit on, it's now officially my life) get it you won't regret it. 
Calamari, shrimp, and veggie tempura - wasn't that great since this followed the meatballs so maybe skip this haha 

Entrees: i had the chefs special. HOW CAN SOMETHING SO SIMPLE BE SO GOOD??? Def worth it. My bf has the squid ink pasta. Super different and he was obsessed

Dessert: banana toffee sticky cake and the cheesecake. Both are life changing. 

Still obsessed with this place and they have a tasting menu for 55 a person! I'll be back for this next time"}
{"text":"Short and sweet- get the bread cart. If you have room for anything else, go for it. 

Hmmm. Ok, the bread cart had a selection of five breads and spreads. Personally, I loved the olive oil/roasted garlic/ parm spread. I'd put that on pasta, fish or chicken. We also had the meatball antipasto- three generous meatballs in a bed of creamy cheesy semolina. It was easily a meal. The torchio with pork ragu was very rich and flavorful, maybe could have used a bit more liquid in the sauce but then it's not really a ragu? The only potential miss were the roasted carrots, a variety of honey roasted baby carrots served whole. The disadvantage was that they were of varying doneness. And idk, I'm not a fan of a mass of baby carrots spilling out of a too small skillet with the tops and tails still on. The presentation also hid the yogurt sauce in the bottom of the skillet, which was an odd flavor in conjunction with the other flavors on the table. 

Give it a try. It's good food, easily accessible, nothing difficult to understand. We'll be back... for bread!"}
{"text":"The duck ragu dish is unbelievable. I'm not even ducking kidding. The coconut cake dessert had me going bananas as well. Go here. Eat all the food. Service was amazing and we loved the patio! You can tell a lot of heart went into the design of this place. Modern and organized yet eclectic all at the same time. My fiancé had the pasta pomodoro which is chef's signature dish and the sauce had a hint of cream to it which rocked."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! 

I highly recommend eating their flatbread appetizer, it's literally to die for. I forgot the name but it taste like a combination of pizza and puff pastry with cheese. #officiallyded"}
{"text":"We may have found a new favorite!  Authentic Italian...amazing flavors that took us back to Italy!  Staff is super friendly. Executive chef Ryan brought us out some amazing flat bread stuffed with cheese while we waited for our food and chatted a bit. Sit at the counter looking into the kitchen where you can watch the action and talk with the guys preparing the food.  We had a sausage pizza that was incredible and fettuccine with mushrooms and roasted garlic that was very rich full of flavor. Definitely will be back on a regular basis!  Not open for lunch yet. Good idea to get reservations for a table, but the kitchen counter was really a fun spot!"}
{"text":"Ok.. I really really really wanted to like this restaurant but it just wasn't that great. The ambiance was lovely (a little dark)  and I enjoyed the artwork. We made a reservation and were seated at the high tops near the bar. It took a very long time to get anyone to take our drink order ok fine, they were busy so I was still optimistic. I ordered the seasonal mushrooms and polenta my friend ordered the bread board. They had a fork on the table and the giant serving spoon the dish came with. Those were my options because the waitress didn't come back until I had finished eating it (I went with the giant spoon)VERY MESSY ! But amazing. The bread didn't come until I was done with the polenta which took quite a while because I could barely fit the giant spoon in my mouth. I ordered the roasted chicken and broccoli rabe . I was starving and very excited, they placed my food in front of me ..no fork. He took it when he cleared my plate and said he'd bring another. I sat for about 15 minutes and when I did taste it, it was horrible. I was very sad because I was so hungry. I had waited all day and my chicken was flavorless and as dry as the Sahara. The broccoli rabe.. I have no clue what happened here. I can usually stomach anything but I could not eat it. It had the flavor of oysters or some sort of seafood. I tried to use my flashlight to examine what the heck was in there but I have no clue. I ordered an additional side because it was inedible. The brussel sprouts were decent . My friends ordered the spaghetti and the fettuccini. One kind of enjoyed the spaghetti the other hated the fettuccini. I tasted a mushroom from their dish and and it was very good but it's not the white fettuccini people are used to seeing and he was being dramatic and said it was stroganoff. The rosé snow cone was pretty. So I asked my friends what their final thoughts were they said..well the tea was good. The spaghetti was half eaten, the chicken I did attempt to eat, the fettuccini went virtually untouched, the bread was pretty much untouched. And I know these people..they can eat! So I will say that I know this establishment is new and it will get better with time but the service was bad. It took a very long time to get anyone to take our drink order, get me a normal size spoon,the bread, a fork, the check, to return my debit card. I most likely will not return unless it's just for a drink."}
{"text":"Went last night again, was not our first time. Love this place, what is not to like? Then read the reviews, and realized that whoever does not like the food there, might  just be hooked into Olive Garden or Oregano type of food / restaurant. Mora offers real Italian food, made professionally with local products, paired with wines that are hard to find anywhere else. There might be a few glitches here and there, but I never had to complain about the service. The staff seems to get along and to have fun working together. Management is always around, checking on tables, chatting with guests. Maybe we just like great food, great wines, fun service, and smiles around us. Maybe the conviviality at Mora is what we appreciate the most. Thank you Mora for another great experience. You will see us again."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends the Friday night. My wife and I ordered the calimari/ shrimp appetizer. She then had a salad whereas I had a steak. Everything seemed to be of decent quality. Until...... two hours later we both became horribly sick. It's Sunday morning as I write this. I'm still sick and she's still shaky. I called the manager \"Lance\" who denied there was a problem and refused a refund but did offer a $25 gift card. No thanks. We lost a weekend of our lives due to this place. And.... It was expensive and not the kind of place I would expect this from. I'm 49 and have only been food poisoned once before by beach cooking in Mexico. I had never requested a refund from any other restaurant in my entire life. My advice, run far and run fast. County health notified."}
{"text":"We love the bar and patio areas at this restaurant. It's located on a busy street but it doesn't feel like it when you are in the bar/patio area. The food and drinks are delicious. Pomodoro pasta and grill octopus are our favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It all started with the lovely hostess Geniveve.  Then Jessica and Kendra totally ROCK the beautiful bar with their charm and tasty libations.  I've had several entrees and each has been exquisite!  With Matt and Tori in the kitchen, it's no surprise that every meal is amazing.  The table service was awesome too...ask for Davide's section! Cheers."}
{"text":"Mixed review.  My wife and I very much liked the space and the Chef's pomodoro was excellent.  The meatballs had a good taste but were over baked.  The Little Gem salad had promise but the lettuce was poorly prepared with a lot of the core mixed in and the leaves were not tender as they should be.
I liked that they had a good selection of draft beers but my wife's $17 wine was at most a 2/12 to 3 oz pour.  It almost evaporated before she drank it.
If we return we would order wine by the bottle so we 
know what we were getting.
Try tutti Santi on Greenway, you will be much happier and have a little more cash in your pocket when you leave.
Draft Peroni is $5 vs. $7 at Mora."}
{"text":"over priced watered down drinks slow service and rude food was just OK"}
{"text":"It's just a truly amazing restaurant with an incredible staff.  The food is always hot and cooked perfectly.  Best spot in town"}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner. Without a reservation you're not getting a table however with some patience we were seated at the bar fairly quickly. Craft cocktails line up the drink menu which no one at the bar could pronounce! Ordered the octopus & beets, my husband had the sea bass & long beans. Veggie dishes were delicious!  Fish dish was nicely cooked and octopus was extremely tender. I would have expected more of a punch with our entrees from an iron chef restaurant and no Coors Light thus the three star rating. We shall return for delish beets and a different entree given the great indoor/outdoor ambiance."}
{"text":"I am updating my review a year later. 
Restaurant row is most def oversaturated, so my habits have adapted. Mora has gone from a sit down place, for me, to a sit at the bar bistro type place. As my tastes adapt I still find this place a great spot. Pasta P is still on point, as are the cocktails. 

The parking does become tricky at peak hours when there isn't valet and I don't feel right about taking spots at the burger place. 

Also, the music, while not blasting anymore , isn't necessarily something I want to spend $50 on food while listening to (hmmm bop?!?!)

Expand the happy hour and get some better tunes are my only complaints."}
{"text":"What a fantastic dinner. No detail was missed by the staff, Beautiful Restaurant with an open air patio and the food was amazing. Scott Conant hosted a special event to celebrate Chef Michael Peters and Team USA and we were lucky enough to have a tasting menu. Some of our favorite dishes were Pork & Veal meatballs, Pasta Pomodoro, Black Campanelle and so so tender Snake River Pork loin. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was AMAZING! It was everything I had hoped for and more. This place does NOT disappoint! Come in and have an evening you will not forget! The handmade pastas and pizza will have you dreaming. Thank you Mora!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary. We were both really happy with experience. We each got the tasting menu (which was really generous) but loved every part of it! The polenta with mushrooms and bacon was amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had some time to kill on Sunday night and decided to try the place out. We're fans of Chopped and Italian food. Our only concern was getting a seat since it only recently opened: a phone call confirmed no reservations available and that there might be a wait.

5:30 PM and we were seated right away!

Last thing first: the food was amazing! We had the fettucine, cavatelli, and a side of Brussels sprouts. The fettucine was lightly dressed and the mushrooms really added to the flavor. The duck and arugula in the cavatelli were similarly fantastic. My wife and I both agreed that the Brussels sprouts were an improvement over her recipe, so she's going to use that technique in future cooking.

The waitress (Katelynn, maybe?) was a frequent presence and extremely helpful in picking wine, blocking the sun at sunset, and boxing up our leftovers. I gave over 20% tip she was so engaging. Apparently our entrees were taking too long so she gave us a burrata appetizer to tide us over. We hadn't even noticed any delay so I appreciated the conscientiousness.

We had a decent seat to watch food coming out of the kitchen and have picked out at least the next four visits' meals! (A manager stopped by repeatedly to check on us, which I usually find a distracting interruption, but she did it well and I didn't even think about it until this review.)

The only complaint is that the music was loud, but I've abandoned any expectations of quiet when dining out. Oh, and there were no risotto dishes. I love risotto!"}
{"text":"I rarely give reviews, but our dinner and service last night at Mora was exceptional. First time there and it was our anniversary. They took such great care of us you would of thought we were royalty. Food matched the service as well. Our first course was the mushroom and truffle polenta with bacon and parmesan. They threw in crusty bread so we could truly enjoy and I can say it's one of the best things I've eaten in awhile. Check Mora out if you haven't."}
{"text":"Inattentive bartender and lack of service on Wednesday night. Restaurant half full. Managers not observant nor any eye contact. Meatballs dry. Cold lamb we had to send it back. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Even though busy the service was good. Wine great, appetizers yummy I made the mistake of ordering the Short Ribs. Lesson one don't order meat at an Italian restaurant. I have no clue what the meat was but it was NOT SHORT RIBS. It was tough and dry and long thin strips that could have never come off any rib. It was completely buried under a huge amount of salad. I have cooked short ribs for years and have ordered and enjoyed them at other 5 star restaurants so the dog is enjoying most of this entree that I brought home. My daughter ordered a pasta dish that she enjoyed so stick to pasta. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"thats a mora! came here on their first official launch.. for starters the ambience resembles fox restraunts in a much more chic way.. the service we recieved from alexandria was impeccible, she was extremely personable and well informed on the menu..the bread cart is heaven especislly if you love guacamole carts and only 8 bucks for almost too much bread...considering im italian i was impressed with the handmade pasta..all in all it was a great place to enjoy good ambience, delicious drinks, and savory food with distinct savory flavors.. we will most certainly be back. highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Has amazing food, service and atmosphere. Perfect place for a date but also a lovely spot for families and more casual dining experiences. Prices are on the higher end, but if you order the right dishes it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Let me say first that we did not give Mora a chance to wow us with their main dishes or desserts.  We were looking for a casual meal of what we hoped would be outstanding pasta dishes.  What we experienced does not inspire us to go back and try a full meal.  

I had the Pasta Pomodora which was okay but its most noticeable flavor was salt; the sauce did not sparkle.  My husband had the Pasta Calamaretti which was definitely better, had a nice heat, but still seemed too salty.  We also ordered the brussel sprouts which were good.  We had mixed feelings about the sangria; my husband liked it, I thought it was a little sweet.

On the positive side, the service was impeccable and the surroundings are beautiful."}
{"text":"There are not enough superlatives.  This place is sublime.

Location, check.  Decor, check. The only tiny improvement that could be made is that the service after the meal slowed down.  After our plates were cleared, it was probably a good 10-15 minutes before our check was presented.

Anyone who has read any of my reviews knows, however, that for me, the most important thing in a restaurant is the food, and oh, such food do they serve at Mora!

My friend and I split everything but the main course.  Here's what we had:

Warmed focaccia, which was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside, served with Parmesan in olive oil.  My one suggestion would be to emulsify the oil if possible as the appearance is a little off-putting.

Veal and Pork Meatballs served on a bed of what I think was a cheese covered polenta and capped, literally, with a crown of basil pesto.  This is the only place I will eat polenta; usually when it is served it seems more like gruel.  Not at Mora.  Creamy and delicious.  And those crowns of pesto....oh, so divine!  I'm not sure I would order this to share in the future as it's just too good!

Pasta Pomodoro...the people at the next table had it and it looked very good so we gave it a shot.  It was as good if not better than it looked.  No little pesto crowns on the pasta, but it was cooked exquisitely and flavored perfectly.  

We did NOT share main courses, although I gave my friend a bit of mine because it was just so amazing and because he'd never eaten it before.  He got a pork chop that was very impressive looking...about 5 inches in diameter, about 1 1/2 inches thick, and with the rib bone attached ... it looked like an overgrown lamb chop.  I had the duck breast and the experience of eating it was almost sexual.  Oh, it was so good, perfectly carmelized sear on the outside and the right amount of pink on the inside.  My only criticism is that there were only two slices, each about the size of my thumb, and I would have joyfully eaten twice as much and been willing to pay more for it.  It was joined on the plate by a lot of things I couldn't identify, possibly some polenta on the bottom, and some small blood orange slices which were delightful, but really, I'd have loved more of the duck and less of the unidentifiables.  But that's just a little thing.  Overall, it was one of perhaps the three best restaurants I've been to in Phoenix and I'll definitely be going back.  I may just have to sign my pay check over to them each month!"}
{"text":"Our first time at moras, the place is quiet and pleasant,waitress and service friendly I ordered grilled octopus and roasted cauliflower, they were delicious, also lamb, and some fish plate they were both okay, the chocolate and caramel desert was very good, so we give it three stars. We will come back."}
{"text":"I am SO excited I finally got to try Mora after hearing nothing but great things about it and let me just say, it definitely lives up to its reputation! The location is very hip, lots of fun places nearby, the interior is beautiful, clean and modern...we sat on the patio which was GREAT! Even being on a busy street they surrounded the patio with tall trees and it feels like you are someplace else! Started with the burrata...amazing! Had pieces of pomegranate in it and I was obsessed! DEFINITELY recommend the rose' snow cone... served in a martini glass, it's definitely unique AND yummy! The melon salad and the pasta pomodoro were PERFECT! I'm telling you, I could've went back the next day and ordered the same exact meal and have been in heaven... twice! Probably my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, cool vibe, and amazing food.  This place is definitely a must to try, and one of our new favs.  Scott Conant also came to our table to make sure we were enjoying everything. Gorgeous, romantic ambience and great service.  Cannot say enough good things about this place and look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"First time at Mora Italian and it has been an amazing experience. We had the octopus and polenta both very delicious but yet not over filling. My wife had the halibut and I had the pork chop, both where out this world!!!!
For dessert we had the Chocolate cake that totally end being one of the best desserts we ever had.
Thank you so much for the special and amazing experience. Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday with some friends.  What a disappointment.  The first waiter took awhile to greet me.  He brought water then disappeared for some time.  He also didn't know much about wine.  When other guests arrived, instead of escorting them to the table, the hostess told them to walk around and find the table themselves lol.  The hostess, waiters, and bartender we encountered were snobby, stuffy, and lacked personality.  It must have been a no smile zone. Maybe they would have lost their jobs if they showed any signs of enjoyment.  Maybe they should take lessons from the kids at In and Out.  As for the food, the calamari was good but overly salty.  I love liver and would not recommend the foie gras at Mora.  The seafood combo was okay and also overly salty.  The pictures on yelp of the fettuccine with chicken convinced us to order it.  The pictures might have tasted better than the actual entree.  The best?  The bone in ribeye.  Thankfully, we ordered it and that was on point.  Had they messed up on my bone in ribeye, I would have lost it.  By the time we got home, one of my friends realized she forgot her sweater at the table.  We called the restaurant and was told they had the sweater but the restaurant was closing.  So we went back another day and no sweater.  Amazing.  Unfortunately, the ribeye was not enough to get me back.  Not sure about all the hype.  After all, a celebrity Chef restaurant should be required to provide good service.  I mean, we should be thankful for having the opportunity to even be seen there.  I'll stick to my local restaurants.  We should have stuck with the original plan and gone to Forno 301.  We had such a great time there the week before."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on a Friday evening before going to the Suns game for some appetizers.  My friend drove and while he wasn't happy about the mandatory valet it was not a deal breaker for him.   We sat at the bar and was immediately waited on.   Drinks came out fast.  I just had water and it never got empty.  I had a salad, can't recall the name but they described it as like a Caesar Salad.  It was not bad but I have to say I prefer the classic to this one.  Dressing could have had more zest.  I  did think the soft boiled eggs were nice.  The potato soup was pretty good.   My friend really like that.  The ribs were very tender but I missed the smoke flavor.   I have to say I didn't really get the Italian flavor here but it was not bad.  

I have to say I did like the atmosphere here.  It had a fun vibe to it.  It was pretty crowded when we went.  This seems to be a pretty popular place."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Italian restaurants in Phoenix. The pasta al pomodoro is absolutely delicious! A must whenever I come here"}
{"text":"I was pretty hyped up to try Mora Italian. I made reservations for 4 people about 6 weeks in advance. Finally the day came, and after all was said and done, Mora failed to live up to that hype. Here is why:

When our meals were delivered to the table.. mine was missing! The waitress said she completely forgot about my meal when giving the kitchen our table's ticket. So 3 people at my table got food, and I had to wait awkwardly for 20 minutes while they slowly ate theirs. At first, my friends politely insisted on waiting for my meal to arrive before digging in, but I had a feeling it would be awhile, and said heck no! Eat up! We had all been counting the days till MORA for 6 weeks! Why should they have to eat it cold? Anyway.. my pasta dish arrived as my wife, and 2 friends were finishing up. 

The consensus around the table was that aside from the timing issues, the food was generally good. The bread cart was underwhelming. Burrata, and ricotta fritters were wonderful. The gnudi portion was tiny, but tasted delicious. My buddy said his steak was cooked perfectly, and my duck ragu pasta was almost worth the wait :)

We ordered every dessert, and nobody at the table was blown away by any of them. They all agreed the desserts were just ok.

It was kind of a hassle to eat here. I wanted to love it, but the whole experience simply made me more irritated than anything else. If I were rating the food alone, I would probably give 4 stars.. Hopefully by the time you make it there, they have all the kinks worked out with the front of the house staff. 

BTW.. Scott Conant is still the shit to me even though his restaurant let me down, and my wife wants to jump his bones."}
{"text":"Ehhh. So many of my friends bragged about this place. It wasn't that great. And the customer service was horrible. It took forever to get my food and drink. I got margarita pizza. She assume that I was vegan so she said no cheese on it when I said no Parmesan. And my fiancé for the black pasta dish. It was super salty. 

We came for My brothers birthday. I discreetly told them to surprise the dessert for him. And she came out with the bill instead of dessert. It was just all wrong. I felt like she didn't care for our table or care that she kept messing up. 

Overall. The place is nice. Nice decor. The game was on. So I watched tv for a bit."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the growing area of 7St between Camelback and Bethany Home Rd area. Having Scott Mora set up shop here is a testament to our city in relation to food. This is a beautiful place. The patio is amazing. We sat inside, but next time weather permitting I'm requesting the patio. Staff are exceptional. The sun was setting and a beam of light was coming in straight into Bathia's eyes. Suddenly the light was out of her eyes and we noticed one of the wait staff had placed himself to block the light. He said the sun would set in about 10 minutes and he would make sure the light would not bother her. And good to his words he stayed blocking the sun, and soon another came to join him to assist. They did this with a smile on their faces as if this was perfectly natural to do. The menu is full of things you wouldn't find in other places and things that are common as well. Everything we had was cooked to perfection and plated beautifully. And the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Did I mention blocking the sun for us :). The person waiting on us was so nice, attentive, and yet not intrusive. The timing of food coming to us allowed us to eat at our own pace and yet not have to wait long for the next course. Overall, our experience was perfect. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, second time here. The first was amazing. 5 stars. So why three? The food is still spectacular but the service was terrible. Let's start with asking for a side of pomodoro sauce on the side for the frito misto. That never came. The pellegrino bottle was brought to the table without a glass. On top of that I had to ask for limes 4 times. No kidding. It took almost an hour for the server to take our order. And then they never brought out one of the side dishes we ordered. Lastly, the only dish at the table which was terrible was the short.rib. It was so chewy I couldn't even eat it Perhaps this restaurant is just too popular now."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. The food was awesome and the service was amazing. We ate here for a combination of the celebration of Father's Day and our anniversary. We will absolutely be back the food was wonderful"}
{"text":"We were recommended to come here by a friend who know restaurants.
The evening was a complete bust, I kid you not! Res was for 6:45 and by 7:00 they still could not seat us so we had to take a table outside. 2 in our part were finally served there plates and two of us sat there for at least 15 mins waiting for ours. all were cold and the timing was way off. The Halibut I orders tasted like chalk.
There are too many good reviews on this restaurant so it all had to be a fluke or a lot of false reviews. Nothing seamed right. It was a waist of time , money and a good evening. I would never come back. 
This is a completely honest review and my name is Harlan Schillinger."}
{"text":"We had the antipasto pea salad and heirloom tomato salad for starters. Both were good but not great. Flavors were nice but bland.  For dinner we shared the pomodora pasta and the mushroom fettuccine. Again both were nice but not great. The mushroom fettuccine was by far better than the bland pomodora pasta. We loved the atmosphere and our waiter Mikhail was very nice. I think it is very expensive. The two of drank water and our bill with tip was $80. No dessert. No appetizers. Just salad and dinner."}
{"text":"I called yesterday and made a reservation for our wedding anniversary. The gentleman that made the reservation even asked if it was for a special occasion and I told him. When we got there we were seated in a two seater next to two families. There wasn't anything intimate or special about it and no one said happy anniversary or even acknowledged it. Why even ask if it's a special occasion? The service and the meal itself was excellent (I had the sea scallops and my husband had the tomato pomodoro, both delicious) the server was very nice too. I would say this place is great for families and groups but if you are a couple expecting an intimate kind of dinner, this definitely is not the place. There are lots of restaurants downtown, a new one opening up all the time - and great service is really what sets you apart from you and the others. If it's a special occasion, please note it and make an effort to mention it. Makes a big difference :)"}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for Italian food in the valley.  The decoration and ambiance were nice. I'd say that the service was good but not great, The food was quite good. I believe that they make a lot of their pastas in house and I appreciate that. The sauces were made with fresh ingredients and were very tasty.  The prices are a bit higher than I like to pay for Italian food, just because it can be done very well pretty inexpensively, but they're right in line with all of the newer restaurants on 7th St.  I'll give it 4 stars for now but I could see giving it 5 upon later visits."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!  Best Italian food that I have had in quite some time. Everything has so much flavor. We will definitely be returning when we have that Italian food itch again!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"I found out this restaurant was opening tonight earlier this morning - we decided to give it a shot and OOOOMMMMGGGGG..... The food was amazing (may I recommend the grilled octopus antipasti - usually skeptical about octopus), but HANDS DOWN, the BEST I've ever had. Definitely gonna be a good to spot - it's affordable, great vibes, and most importantly - DELICIOUS. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Great setting; great antipasto, wonderful pasta, excellent service, but pricey, especially the wines."}
{"text":"So loud food mediocre and services very slow.
Tried last friday with family .
Nothing has value for the money we spent there.
Many dishes pasta are with nice presentation but tasty is mediocre.
Small portion of pasta and over price. 
I think Mora needs more than STELLAR Chef."}
{"text":"Ahhh was waiting for so long for this place open and I'm pretty disappointed with the first meal

Sat at the bar for dinner. So I've been checking open table religiously for a reservation and they only show 8:30 and 9pm reservations. I get there right at 5 (when they open) to make sure I can sit down. I was there for two hours and the place was never packed and they had a ton of waiters around. Just seemed odd. 

Anyways to the food

Ordered the bread cart. Bread was good, not great but can we get some warm bread for 8 freakin dollars. I only tried the garlic sauce and how do you not include olive oil as a dipper? This is an Italian spot right? 

I ordered the marg pizza. Wasn't impressed at all. The burretta was tasteless, pizza was burnt and just wasnt good. 

Bartender guessed I wasn't feeling much so he handed me the dessert menu and said pick out something on him. Reallly? No chocolate on there? So i tried the caramel treat. Had one bite and passed it to side. Wasnt good at all. 

Overall, disappointed. I'm 50% italian, mother is 100% and this place didnt live up to an Italian joint. I probably should have tried the pasta but eh, if u cant make a good pizza or dessert, you aint getting my biznesssss"}
{"text":"Oh myyyyyy. I went into Mora expecting it to not meet expectations. I was wrong. It exceeded my expectations. I have been to Mora twice.... once with a friend and once with the husband for my birthday.

 Let me start by saying, Mora is not that expensive. They aren't cheap, but they could be way pricier than they are, which is fab. 

The service here is great and I got thoughtful recommendations on both visits. The wait staff also does not push food to increase the cost of the meal. On both visits I shared a couple items with my dining companion and did not feel like this was frowned upon in any way. 

The food here is some of the best in Phoenix. My first visit my friend and I shared  the ricotta fritters, the gnudi, the guanciale pizza, and the budino. The fritters were awesome.... served on  onions that had clearly been cooked for a long time.... the portion looked small, but it was actually quite filling and satisfying. It had a nice savory flavor with the sauce being a bit sweet and cutting through the richness of the cheese. So good. The gnudi was also incredible. They didn't look like much coming out, but they were little balls of pure joy. They were super buttery and tasted completely unhealthy and delicious. The pizza was also outstanding. The crust was salty in the best possible way. The toppings were perfectly balanced.... we took some home and it was equally tasty the next day. Our waitress even snuck us a little bread (which was awesome, but maybe not worth 8$). The only disappointing item was the budino.... it wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to the rest of the food. On second visit, I had to get the ricotta fritters again (mmmmm). We also shared their pomodoro spaghetti and added meatballs and the sopressata pizza. Now... I would NEVER order spaghetti pomodoro... so boring, right? Not this one! This was the most delicious spaghetti pomodoro I have ever tasted. It didn't even need the meatballs (though they were also wonderful). The sauce was luscious. Yes. I think they put butter or cheese or olive oil or some combination of those things in the sauce and it works. The pizza was also very tasty.... not as good as the guanciale, but close. For dessert, the restaurant comped a (huge) slice of coconut/lime cake for my birthday (with a candle :-D). Now this is the way to go! This cake was soooo good and so big I ate it all week long (and it stayed moist.... no joke!). I'd highly recommend it! 


I also tried a few of their cocktails with their delish basil/gin drink being the best and their strawberry drink being a close second. 

So you know how I mentioned the prices? Ya.... both visits were under 100$ with cocktails and leftovers. For a special occasion dinner, that's a huge win. Go there.... you will thank me!


Ps 1700!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff and food. Victor, our server was outstanding, and the manger Jess was attentive. Party of 8 and on a busy night, Victor did a remarkable job juggling our demands with his workload. Food was exceptional, staff was prompt, professional, and on point. I highly recommend Mora on your local restaurant list."}
{"text":"Great pasta and respective garnishes. I loved the atmosphere and music! Generally a well to do crowd - service is up to par, although dish descriptions from the server could've been sharper and better honed. Price is ridiculous. Two 6 oz pasta portions cost $40; not my idea of value. Id still recommend however."}
{"text":"What a great place!!  The decor, the ambiance, the vibe, the music, the service, and of course the food are all top-notch.  My wife and I are huge Scott Conant fans and we used to frequent his Beverly Hills restaurant, Scarpetta, often when we used to live there.  More on that later.

It was our 2nd wedding anniversary a few weeks ago and I called MORA on a Saturday afternoon hoping to get a reservation.  I was told they are completely booked but I was welcome to come in a try to get a seat at the first-come-first-served kitchen bar that overlooks all the kitchen action.  Sold!!  I love that.  As soon as we walked in a couple sitting at the bar got up.  We were seated immediately in front of the bread/pizza making section.  No complaints here!!

Here is the cool part.  Scott Conant was there that night and before we sat down, he saw me, and even though we don't actually \"know each other\" I felt like he recognized me from Scarpetta and he came right over and said hello.

We were amazed by the vibe in this place.  Cool music, but not overwhelmingly loud where you cant have a conversation.  The place was buzzing with trendy hipsters, and cool foodies.  High end service and food, but very unpretentious.  We were greeted by a very friendly server.  Who recommended a couple of wonderful cocktails.  I had the Amalfi Sour.  So refreshing.  I love grapefruit in my cocktail.  The fresh basil leaf gives it a great finishing note.  My wife ordered the Submarino.  Equally refreshing with a hint of pepper at the end.  Really unique.

We started with the Focaccia di Recco.  2 layers of paper thin focaccia baked with an ooey-gooey stracchino cheese in between, topped with course salt.  Perfection!  Ask for a side of honey to dip it in...you'll thank me later.  We ordered the Seasonal Mushrooms \"Boscaiola\".  It's creamy polenta accompanied by truffles and bacon.  So much flavor.  We moved on to a pasta course.  We went with the Cavatelli; duck ragu, truffles and arugula.  The pasta was a perfect aldente, the duck was rich and tender, and the sauce had tons of flavor.  For our main course, we ordered the grilled pork chop.  It had a beautiful rosemary and mustard seed crust, cooked perfectly with a side of refreshing greens and a caper butter sauce.  Yeah!  I gnawed on the bone when we were done!  WHAT ABOUT IT?!?!?! 

During our dinner, a couple of the mangers approached us to congratulate us on our anniversary, and we had such a lovely conversation.  Everyone who works there is so friendly and down to earth.  They treated us to a beautiful slice of the Cubano Coconut Cake and a couple of glasses of perseco.  We've been there twice since then and the experience has been the same every time.  Fun, friendly, relaxing and amazing food.  Thank you Chef Conant for bringing MORA to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the slow service, serving size and flavor of food. The best part was my room mates dessert sorbet."}
{"text":"We went to Mora to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The valet was friendly and responsive. The hostess was juggling a phone call, holding a doggy bag for another patron, and managing the door during a dust storm. She remained unfrazzeled and promptly sat us on a half booth two-top table near the kitchen.  Our server was nice and in training. She had a senior person shadowing her. I asked for a Moretti beer to start and was told they were out of stock. I settled on a Peroni, which came out in an interesting Peroni glass. My spouse had a dry white wine which she enjoyed. We ordered antipasti: the ricotta fritters and the octopus. Both were delicious. The manager delivered them to the table. He was very polite and friendly. In the meantime our neighbors in the next booth finished their meal and the table was turned for another party. Two professional looking men were joined by a third, older gentlemen. This is where things took a bit of a negative turn. The manager was obviously acquainted with the older guy at this table next to us. These tables are really close to each other. The manager hovered over my back for what seemed like forever talking about Michigan/Ohio State football, relatives, traveling etc. it was really hard for my wife and I to enjoy each other's company while this was going on.  Our entrees came out as the manager moved on. Pasta pomodoro with meatballs and Black Campanelle. The tomato pasta was so creamy and delicious, I don't know how they do it. The Campanelle included clams and was great. I asked our server to match a red wine with the Campanelle, she did a great job. Unfortunately as our neighbors' food came up, another server wedged herself between our table and theirs. We literally had her butt in our faces. I guess the configuration of the tables with the shared red leather booth makes this inevitable, but it was somewhat off-putting. We finished our pasta and ordered dessert and coffee. The drinks came out promptly and were perfect. The olive oil cake was fresh and delicious. The gelato, however, was very soupy.  It's almost as if it sat in proximity to a warming station as our other dessert was prepared. So......we really loved the food which deserves at least four stars (except for the gelato). The restaurant is cool. I wish we had requested a high top or another table. I recommend that when regulars come in that the staff remind themselves that for some of us this night may be a special occasion. Based upon the overall experience I dropped down to 3. We'll probably come back. Maybe sit at the bar?"}
{"text":"Alright, so I was over the moon when I heard Scott Conant's restaurant has opened in Phoenix, although my ignorant ass didn't know about it for a good few months. I made reservations immediately for the same night to meet a friend for dinner. She was a few minutes late and I was more than happy to start with a glass of wine while I waited. By the time my friend showed up, I was pretty ravenous and we decided to order the ricotta fritters. This was actually quite spectacular and we inhaled all of it within seconds. I was terribly disappointed to not see gnocchi on the menu, but our server highly recommended the pasta al pomodoro with meatballs. He went on for a good five minutes describing how good it actually tastes and clearly it worked! It peaked my interest so much that I had to interrupt his spiel and tell him to place an order for it right that second. My friend ordered the strozzapretti while I looked at her with befuddlement and confusion, wondering if she even heard how good the server made the pomodoro sound. Expecting to clearly be the one with the better dish that night, I waited patiently.. of course, with a slight air of arrogance. The plates arrived and I could barely contain my glee. I took the first bite of the pasta and my bubble burst so quickly that it took me a while to understand what exactly had happened. Ugh!! All those nights I spent watching Chopped with Scott Conant criticizing almost every lesser mortal's attempt to please him with Italian food, was just building up to this moment. Alas! After a few bites, I let my disappointment sink in and tried to enjoy my food. Honestly, it wasn't a bad dish by any measure. It was the hype I had created for myself that made it seem like a terrible let down. According to my friend, the dish tasted like a margarita pizza and I couldn't agree more.. except that it wasn't a pizza. She did seem to enjoy what she ordered, so it wasn't a complete let down. I guess. I don't know if I would recommend this place for other Chopped fanatics.. But otherwise, it seems like an alright place."}
{"text":"I have forgotten our servers name but she was amazing. Wonderful food and wine recommendations. We chose the Chiefs Signature pasta which was simple yet tasty. I highly recommend this spot abs look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"If you love lamb then you must try the lamb at Mora.. Best I have had in a very long time.. 
The service was good.. Portions were nice size and everything was wonderful.. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for dinner. Delicious food, ordered the pasta pomodoro, and a couple of other dishes that were just lovely. The atmosphere was great, and our server, Kat,  very friendly and attentive- she made the whole experience even better! We will be coming back, hungry for more, and requesting her service again!"}
{"text":"Finally got out to Mora.....wildly disappointed....where to begin......Valet would not let me park my own vehicle (I still would have tipped the same $10) sorry but I don't want a stranger in or driving my vehicle.....Ordered 2 apps...Octopus on Cannelloni beans and sausage....Octopus was cooked perfectly...the rest/majority of the dish..terrible....3/4 of the beans were hard not cooked thru at all....the sausage tasted like a cheap Spanish hot dog..totally overpowered the dish..disgusting.....the part that bothered me the most was the fact that we left the entire appetizer uneaten except for the pieces of octopus and the server didnt ask why.  She clearly knew there was a problem with the dish.....it was an $18 appetizer and we left the entire thing...2nd appetizer..... the \"Ricotta Fritters\" they were just OK..nothing remarkable...certainly not worth the price.....For my entrée I ordered the Pasta Pomodoro with a side of veal meatballs....the Pomodoro was the best dish all night....the only dish that was actually worth the price tag...as for their signature veal meatballs....fuggetaboutit! They tasted like pure ground sausage in the shape of a meatball..I make and have eaten veal meatballs many times and know how veal meatballs should have a light airy consistency and a very mild melt in your mouth texture and flavor...as for these....its like someone when to McDonalds and ground up their sausage patty and formed it into a ball......We also ordered a side dish of their famous Brussel sprouts....wayyy too rich..bacon overpowered the entire dish....hardly ate it..once again never questioned why.......The wife had a whole fish entrée....she thought it was OK..I tasted it and found it to be overly fishy in flavor..unsure if this was due to the freshness or just the flavor for that species of fish.....Overall this was a terrible meal...which is quite unfortunate due to the fact that I have heard such positive reviews and have wanted to dine here for quite some time....save your money folks...I spent $150 for 2 people..no dessert and only 2 glasses of wine (both consumed by my wife).  As purely a point of reference I come from Brooklyn and I am of Italian descent and have found many other excellent Italian restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Mora on May 9th. It was not that good. I had the cavitelli. The pasta was dry and quite honestly didn't have a lot of flavor. The portions were small.  The bar tenders rock. The place is attractive."}
{"text":"Y.U.M.M.Y. I was so excited to try this eatery from Scott Conant, and we were not disappointed. We were seated in the high-top area of the bar/restaurant and had excellent service. We enjoyed visiting with the people around us and were able to see a whole lot of the menu. We settled on sharing the HH pork ribs & short rib polpette before sharing the charred octopus (oh my!) lamb ragu, and the golden beets. The lamb ragu was tender and perfectly seasoned - what a treat. Dessert found us sharing the absolutely perfect warm chocolate cake with a side of raspberry sorbet. All in all - a perfect menu from start to finish. *Note... we did not order the country bread, but our new friends at the table next to us did. It was HUGE! If you're gonna do it, share with friends. They did :)"}
{"text":"So.. tonight was my first time at Mora. To be honest at first I wasn't impressed at all. We got there early for our reservation and said they would seat us soon.  The hostess put us outside in 100 degree heat with misters. We could deal with that but what I couldn't deal with is no service and water or offer for drinks in about 10 mins. So I walked up to the Manager and said we need to get a better table and step up the service because this is my first time at your place. Well.. he did. We moved in side and he apologized for the lack of service and opened the conversation with a bottle of Rose on house. My intention was not to get anything for free but to get good service. After the ice breaking, it was flawless. The waitress was amazing. We had two bottles of wine that were magnificent. I highly recommend the meatballs, octopus and cheese bread for apps. For dinner I had the black pasta with clams. The sides of beets and brussel sprouts were off the chart. For dessert, the Italian pudding and coconut cake were delicious.  The server even asked the Chef for fresh fruit because one of the guests wanted it with some liquor. And they did it. Highly recommend it. They stand by the service, quality and experience."}
{"text":"Tried their tasting menu and it was not bad but it was not good either

Deserts - 3/5"}
{"text":"dinner with work friends - great place for sharing plates and stories. Open concept, close seating, but great energy and friendly staff.  Diver scallops and halibut were prepared perfectly, the octopus app was a little over salty for most tastes at our table, and the pasta dishes were all excellently prepared."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area after just one visit. My wife and I went out about a month ago (I know, I've procrastinated in writing this review) and we spent about two hours at the restaurant which was a very pleasant experience and a very much needed change from the all too common 45 minutes in and out rush. The service was extraordinary with our waiter spacing out the courses perfectly. 

The evening started with the Barolo Rye Cider for me which was well mixed and refreshing (I know, most won't think of rye whiskey as refreshing but give it a chance next time you go). The Bread Cart  was the first item ordered and we absolutely loved it; the meats were of great quality and eggplant caponata added a little \"kick\" to the sampling experience without going the tex-mex route (Hallelujah). 

For a second treat we ordered the Seasonal Mushroom \"Boscaiola\" and it was HEAVEN! The flavors of truffle and bacon were present but delicate so that they were not to cast a shadow over the creamy polenta. 

We then ordered two pasta dishes; she had the Cavatelli and I had the Fettuccine. The duck ragu was absolutely incredible and it made the dish, in my opinion. I almost liked her dish better than mine... but I said \"almost\". The escarole gave the dish that extra texture that sometimes pasta needs, the fettuccini itself was fresh and light and the mushroom and garlic sauce was just thick enough to stay on the pasta without adding the unnecessary weight that is often associated with fat cousin Alfredo. 

We also shared the Grilled Pork Chop; it too was nicely seasoned and cooked well, while remaining juicy. 

For dessert we shared the Mora Sundae which put an extra touch of elegance on the evening. It was sweet, rich, decadent and yet it did not overpower the flavors of the berries and the sorbet. 

The entire dinning experience was great and Chef Scott even stopped by to say hello! Next time maybe I'll sneak in taking a picture with him!? See you soon, Mora!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday evening! The service, food and atmosphere was great! The gnuddi was everything! The bread is a little overrated. MAKE RESERVATIONS or be prepared to wait. Great wine selection and the mule was pretty good. I would've liked to hear Italian music vs whatever was playing but otherwise it was a great dinner experience."}
{"text":"First I want to start off with a few of the positives. The food was very good; fresh, quality tasting ingredients and unique ideas on some dishes. Next, the atmosphere was really nice, slightly loud, but you didn't feel like you were dining on 7th Street job well done on the build out with the open kitchen and extra-large space. 

Now if we weren't with close friends having a fantastic conversation I would have complained to a manager. With an 8:30pm reservation on Saturday night, not a problem having to wait a few minutes before getting seated. Getting seated and not having a drink order placed for 30 minutes a little absurd. Ordering a pizza for an appetizer and that taking 45 minutes to an hour to come to the table just ludicrous...especially as you can visually see the fire going non-stop in the oven! The waiter didn't apologize for the delay what-so-ever even after dropping a few hints nothing was said or done like a complimentary bread basket as we waited and waited and waited. 

It doesn't get better because of the extraordinary slow service throughout the dinner we don't get the opportunity to try the desert or coffee. As we mention this to the server that we have to get home to our children he still is not apologetic! An 8:30pm reservation with a two course dinner being completed a little before 11pm is not acceptable. The food was of high quality, not the best Italian food I've had in Phoenix, but not worth the wait in our humble opinion. Hopefully this gets figured out otherwise we will most likely be trying a different concept in the not too distant future. 

And if you look at my reviews I'm hard pressed to give anything below a 4-star so this was tough to write."}
{"text":"Every sip of the Pinot Bianco (Dolomiti, Italy), and every bite from beginning (Foie gras pate) to end (Coconut layer cake) were heavenly.  I did not want the ricotta and mascarpone gnudi to disappear, but like a puffy cloud they melted away in my mouth. 
The staff was friendly, and meal delivery was prompt.  Perhaps too prompt, since I was still enjoying the paté when they delivered the gnudi.  
Two thumbs up for a return visit.  This should give Fox concepts a run for their money."}
{"text":"The restaurant is aesthetically very pleasing, nicely decorated, and ultra cool. The service was one of the the best I have ever had in any phoenix area restaurant. The food is as good as they say, spectacular.  What a great night out. We had the Pasta Pomodoro and Fettuccine, polenta, and the Brussel sprouts. It was all delish. 

We had the chocolate Zeppoles for dessert which were not standard type of zeppoles and just okay. The sauces that came with were good though. I hear the coconut cake was to die for but they stopped making it. Bring it back. I love a good coconut cake.  Ha! 

I can not wait to go back to this restaurant. I am still dreaming of the pasta! And coming from a person who does not  usually order pasta in an italian restaurant.

Thank you Mora for the excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised we had such a bad experience. I had never been to Mora before but just assumed it would be good due to its prime location, cool aesthetic, and popularity. 3 of us shared a margarita pizza and meatballs for appetizers. The meatballs lacked flavor but were saturated in melted cheese and I'm not mad at anything saturated in melted cheese. The pizza was pretty good. None of the 3 of us enjoyed the Pasta Pomodoro or the Ricotta & Mascarpone Gnudi (with barely any lobster) I wouldn't say we complained but when the server asked how dinner was we did tell him we did not enjoy the entrees. A manager did come over and to my surprise after leaving the majority of the Pasta Pomodoro and 3 of the Gnudi balls uneaten, expressing we did not enjoy entrees all of the food was still on the bill. Our server dropped the F bomb in casual conversation. We did not see him often and appeared to have a bit of a meltdown toward the end of the night. They actually had another person assist our table after we mentioned our discontent. Maybe he doesn't take criticism well... not sure. Either way, we won't be back"}
