{"text":"This is more of a Tex Mex BBQ burrito place. Very specialized and very good. You pick braised beef, pulled pork, smoked chicken, or veg, add rice and beans, then a few condiments. Burritos, burrito bowls, or salads only.   The staff are also fantastic. When I walked in with my arm in a sling, one sweetheart in particular insisted on carrying my tray to the table. When I was finished, she packed up my leftovers and helped me with my coat. Rare gem."}
{"text":"This place is very good! Fresh, tasty, great variety and fast service. Good place for casual tasty food!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better burritos I've ever had. Can be pretty pricey to be honest, but worth it since they're extremely generous with their portions and you are one full baby after eating a meal. Their dishes do tend to taste similar so I wouldn't go too often but every couple of weeks definitely hits the spot. A+ guys"}
{"text":"Great 1st experience at Tejano! The nacho chips in my burrito was a was a pleasant surprise and the spicy sauce was just right. Glad to have them in the neighbourhood will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious pulled pork burrito. Worth the dollar for their fresh cheese! The spicy sauce is not very hot but still quite tasty. Very generous sized burrito ... A struggle to finish and a nap needed! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Their burritos are so freaking delicious here! I've tried everything on their menu and I definitely recommend the pulled pork or the vegetarian option (beware though, the pulled pork is quite spicy). The toppings are limited, but very fresh and I'm so happy that they offer cilantro sauce! Their hot sauce is really strong, so be careful (I really wish they had something in between their mild sauce and their hot sauce). I'm only giving this four stars because their burritos and salads are quite pricey and their menu is still kind of small, but I do suggest you check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place made me realize all the previous burritos I'd had were so average. The ingredients are really fresh and tasty and prepped in-house from the delicious chili beans to perfect pickled onions. (You may want to immediately go for the ancho beef but I'd recommend the chicken, too.) No disappointing portions here - show up if you want to eat!"}
{"text":"My husband is big on tex-mex/Mexican food and he is Tejano's new biggest fan. I'm a bit more indifferent but still really enjoyed the food here. We got two regular burritos --one with pulled pork, and one with BBQ beef. Personally I liked the pulled pork one a smidge better (great smoky taste that was more unique than BBQ) but I would readily order either one again in a heartbeat.   It's important to note that this is the same owner as Blackstrap BBQ. Although we were not huge fans of BSBBQ (see my other review), it's quite different to eat the pulled pork in a burrito with other ingredients you choose yourself.   Seating is very limited -- one counter with 7 stools -- but is perfect for take-out. While we're unlikely to go back to BSBBQ, we'll be back here for sure. There are not a lot of good burrito options in Montreal, and this place does them very well."}
{"text":"Meilleur burrito en ville la viande est incroyable le peix est raisonnable et le personnel est acueuillent je le recommande !"}
{"text":"The Ultimate Burrito experience! My 1st time  here and many more to come. The Burritos are are delicious and generous. This small little gem in St Henri is brought to you by the same owners as Blackstrap. I was def in my element with the small cozy atomsphere."}
{"text":"$26 for a burrito and a small salad? Seriously? You'd get 5 stars for the beef brisket burrito cause it was awesome (for $13 it better be), but an $11 small salad is crazy, especially when it's just pickled burrito toppings, lettuce and some soupy smoked chicken. Totally not worth it. That measly handful of lettuce had better have been grown in organic fertilizer made from rabbits that poop rainbows...  And how is it $11 for a small salad and $13 for a large that's double the size (though mostly just double the lettuce)? What do you have against people who eat salad? You can't use cheap lettuce to subsidize your more expensive dishes. I felt totally ripped off."}
{"text":"Great burritos full of flavor. Staff is very friendly. Highly recommend. Try the nacho chips and salsa really delicious."}
{"text":"I am now convinced locals don't know about burritos, let alone what a taqueria is.  I will give Tejano some credit for there were some decent flavours in the veg burrito I had here, but it didn't explode and was a floppy small size.  Their service was slow and precious in that hipster 'we're artisans' type way.  Too bad Montreal doesn't have a full-on taqueria like you find in Cali and the SoWest of the US - it would be huge  here.  The closest I have found here, at least in burrito size and flavours, is Cantina in Pointe St. Charles (their owners are from SanFran and know what constitutes a superior burrito).  Frick I miss the taquerias I enjoyed in the US."}
{"text":"I'm all about the burrito and so is Tejano! I really enjoyed my first visit hear, I had a vegetarian burrito and Vanessa had  a pulled pork tostada. The ingredients were all fresh and tasty and we were both pleased with our experience here.   The menu is simple and the prices are reasonable so I think that this place will do well. Tejano is a great addition to the ever expanding Sud-ouest restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Walked in and was surprised to be greeted by 5 staff behind the counter of this tiny place. Order the beef and pork, both regular size which is plenty and very good. I can understand why there are so many staff, the place is a revolving door."}
{"text":"The gist of it for me is : great burritos, but limited choice and space.  If it was just for the burritos, if happily give this place a 5 star. The food tastes great and surprisingly fresh. I had a bowl with chicken personally. Very filling too! I'll definitely be going back.  Now the flip side is burritos is the only thing they have, so that kind of limits the experience. The place is very small too so if you go during peak hours don't expect a place sitting.  Also the staff was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Meh... Overpriced burritos. Slowish service.. I don't find they have a ton of toppings to choose from. The meats are decent. The burrito is pretty good but not amazing, not worth the price. I had the tacos once and felt completely ripped off, small portion of meat, like a table spoon.  Also pretty sure they charge for guacamole and sour cream... It's a burrito place, should just come with the burrito at that price.  Oh well.. Tons of these kind of places are going up so at least there's more options in the city to buy burritos.. Check around as I don't think this place is worth it."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and ordered a chicken burrito to go. I took a whole wheat burrito with rice and beans for the base. (They told the person beside me that without that base the burrito can get leaky as they wanted the burrito without a base). Next I chose my toppings - all are free except for guacamole and homemade cheese which I didn't get. The toppings were the best part of the burrito as they had a lot of flavour - particularly the salsa. The end result was a HUGE burrito (10$). Probably hard to finish for people with small appetites...  Parking nearby is available on the street but you may have to walk a bit..."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! I had the chicken salad. The chicken was marinated and juicy, similar to carnitas - unlike in many other burrito places, where the chicken tends to be dry. Lots of goodies in the salad, notably the pickled onions. Rice and beans added at no extra cost. I found the price a bit high, but the food was so good that I'll still go back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and very flavourful! I've been there numerous times as I work close-by so I've gotten to play around with the combinations to know what works best because piling it all on doesn't necessarily taste best. If you choose ALL possible toppings, it ends up being too acidic and gives me heartburn. Also, their burritos are so large that I usually either eat 1/2 for lunch, 1/2 for dinner or I order a salad bowl. It's basically a bed of lettuce topped with everything that would go into a burrito and it keeps better than a burrito which ends up a little soggy. All in all, my fave go-to order is the ancho beef burrito or salad bowl - I prefer it to the smoked chicken. You'll definitely be seeing me again soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing big, fat stuffed delicious burritos ! La viande ici vole la vedette! Fumée à point, épicée délicatement ou de façon robuste, selon notre choix! And the sauces! Scrumptious! And the condiments, so many mouth-watering choices! Just try to resist!!"}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork burrito, all dressed (wife and kid had burrito bowl and regular size beef burrito). Everything was excellent and oh, forgot to mention, hands down biggest burrito in the city (12 inch), simply massive! Great service too. I called in the order and when I arrived, it was ready but there was actually a little mistake.  I notified the staff and they took care of it without hesitation."}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars but 40$+ for 2 person at a fast food restaurant without any waiter service is waaay too much. Hard to find seats where to eat because it's so small .. The owner should review the pricing."}
{"text":"It was an ok/meh chicken burrito for the price of $9 before tax. $1 more to add guacamole seemed a bit much for a topping that's pretty critical. It's filling but burritos should be a little cheaper - it's supposed to be one of the more accessible foods in the South.  I have no complaints about the quality of the food. Curteous & friendly staff. Decor pretty boring even if it's more of a take out joint.   Hoping quantity increases and guacamole get included. That would bump up to a 4 star."}
{"text":"Not that I think this review changes anything at all but........  I agree with the consensus.   Got first taste of this place for free via an Elite event at Dodgebow so I've been reserving this review for a fair shot...  Came a second time a few months back w muh best bud: we each had 2 kinds of tacos, but found it soooo hella expensive for what it was that I again reserved reviewing this place for one more shot.   I had a feeling, and i was right, that ordering the \"burrito bowl\" would be the piece de resistance that would make or break this place. 20$ later (which does seem expensive for 1 bowl...), my suspicions were confirmed: the bowl is the way to go here.   Being that there's very few spots to sit the bowl really makes this place worth it. Order a bowl to go. I had everything possible loaded onto that burrito bowl tonight n ordered it with the beef and ancho option: it was phenomenal! I added queso fresco, guacamole and 2 taco tortillas each for 1$ extra (so 4$ extra total) and dressed it with the spiciest sauce they have: yummmmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!! Me n my bf both attacked the 1 bowl for supper and we still have left overs for lunch tmora! (sooo lookin forward to lunch tmoraaaaa!)   So that's it, long story short, get the bowl, get it to go, go ahead n pay for the extras: then u will NOT be disappointed.   Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"The food is really good here, but I'm frustrated with the service recently. I don't work super close to Tejano so i figured id order via uber eats like i tend to do when I'm craving the food here. However, it was 12:30 and they weren't available on UE so i called and asked them about it and they said \"yeah we don't know when were going to turn the iPad on for Uber Eats Clearly a customer ready to pay for food and I was basically told \"oh well\"  I ended up giving my money to another establishment. I know my order wont make or break the business but still, would you value a potential client? Also, whats the point of doing UE if you are not even using it to its full potential?"}
{"text":"Great burrito and they carry Prime Mate soda.  They were out of guacamole when I went, though."}
{"text":"This little spot in St Henri is tucked away on a side street, offers limited seating and practicality no ambiance, but the food is delish! The main draw here is definitely the burritos; you choose your wrap, fillings, toppings, salsa and extras, and voila! All the ingredients are laid out in front of you, so easy to see and choose. I ordered the pulled pork on whole wheat with all the trimmings including guacamole and spicy sauce, and the finished product was delicious! The meat was tender and flavourful, the toppings were fresh, and that wrap was so big, I'm surprised it didn't fall at the seams. You can grab a Mexican soda while you're there too! Overall, besides the price which can add up easily depending on what you're adding on, and lack of space, the food is totally worth the trip. They now offer delivery too so I'm Uber happy"}
{"text":"Probably the best burritos in Montreal. Enormous, delicious fresh toppings, incredible soft savoury bbq beef and pork and chicken, love the cilantro sauce and spicy sauce and pickled onions and corn... All the things please. And perhaps because I like all the toppings even the small size is the heft of a new born baby and easily two meals for me. They do a mega salad too if that's more up your alley.   This would be my favourite place in the sud-ouest or possibly ever if they had beer and a patio, but it's pretty much perfect in every way as is, and best for take out."}
{"text":"Holy Burrito! LOVED this place. I always like the places that let you build your own burrito, Tejano is one of the best I've had. It's a nice jumbo tortilla available regular or whole wheat that you can then pack with as much or as little as you want. Admittingly I went a bit overboard, I has chicken, beef, chili, refried beans, guac, cheese, onions, lettuce, cilantro-lime dressing and sour cream. By the time they were done it was pretty heavy but absolutely delicious. You can also get it as a bowl. The place is small but there's place to sit and turnover is pretty quick.   Service was very friendly as well. Will definitely be going back here. You should go too....and I don't even know who you are, but you should go."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burrito in the city. Special mention to the pulled pork. Oh and also, huge portions - which is always essential when it comes to burritos -. I wish the spicy sauce could be spicier but it's just me. Highly effective staff, the 5 burritos we ordered were ready in a matter of minutes. Can't wait to try their chicken next time!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this one short and sweet, but I had the beef burrito, and it did not disappoint - it was a big portion and quite tasty, not the best beef burrito I've had but still very good and pretty cheap at $10, I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick,  filling,  tasty and fresh Mexican food.   You pick the style (burrito, taco, salad, etc) then the protien and the fresh ingredients.  There is not a lot of room but it was not busy so we found chairs easily.   From order to eating was less than 5 minutes.  Good value and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best burrito I have had in Montreal, although it's a somewhat low bar. No, you won't find burritos in this city or even country that are better than what's on offer in the U.S. (leaving out NYC, which has a strong pizza game but is surprisingly low on great Mexican or Tex-Mex food). If Tejano were in LA, I would give it three to four stars but not expect it to survive long at its (reasonable for Montreal) prices. But it's not in LA, and it's a notch better than the solid offerings at Chipotle in Toronto. As good as it gets in the 514, with an honourable mention for the veggie offerings at Velo Burrito in NDQ on Beaubien.   We ordered two XL burritos, one with brisket and the other with chicken. The chicken was exceptional, marinated until rich and smoky. The staff were welcoming, chatty, and prompt; they don't deserve the comment below about hipster ponderousness in food preparation. Christa is correct that guacamole is a $1 add-on; for me, while not ideal, this compares favourably to the $2.21 guacamole at Chipotle on Yonge, as does the $9 price tag for a burrito (Chipotle: $8.95). No, this is not a real taqueria, but you will definitely see me gorging on burritos here again."}
{"text":"Possiblement la meilleure place à burrito dans le coin, et il y en a beaucoup. Burrito super gros, à partager à deux si vous avez pas un gros appetit. L'endroit est sympa et le service excellent.    PS : Prend l'extra guacamole. Awaye donc, fait pas ton cheap."}
{"text":"Enormous burritos stuffed to the absolute breaking point. A tad pricey (2 people, 2 burritos & 1 bottle of water was almost $40) but if the food is good, I don't mind in the least. Ordered the pork and beef burrito with the works inside and I was not disappointed! I can assure you, you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"An authentic Texan experience is what you'll find at Tejano BBQ Burrito; at least that's according to my husband who happens to be Texan!  Nested in the heart of St-Henri on Notre-Dame Street, and using a preparation method similar to Subway's, Tejano BBQ Burrito allows you to put whatever the heck you want in its delicious burrito. If you misuse this power, you'll end up with one very fat dripping barely-holding-together burrito; but since when is that a bad thing anyway?   Offering a selection of salad bowls or classic (regular or XL) burritos, Tejano is equipped to please most palates; its protein options include chicken, beef, pork and a vegetarian chili (my choice!)  While their service isn't the fastest, especially when there's a lineup of hungry people who want to fill their burrito to the rim from a wide (I mean it, there are a LOT of options) selection of fillings, I appreciate that the clerks are not stressed-out machine-like slaves. My philosophy is the following; take your time, but it better be good!   The place offers some popular complementary Tex-Mex drinks (Jarrito, anyone?) and can sit about 10 people maximum. It's more of a take-out model than a fancy restaurant, yet my husband and I still prefer to grab a seat at the counter set up for their clients and eat right there and then (especially during winter).   It's a great place, a guilty pleasure really, and I would consider going more often if I had the self-control necessary to not stuff the tortilla with copious amounts beans, rice, chili, sour cream, guacamole and everything under the sun in the burrito. I want to retain my figure after all!  If you're a starving youth, go there; you'll get your money's worth of Tex-Mex deliciousness!"}
{"text":"A good burrito is hard to come by in this city unless of course you happen to pay a visit to Tejano BBQ.  In that case you will most certainly satiate your need for one.  This burrito shop is located in St Henri and is serving up some very delicious burritos and tacos.  The shop is quite small and seating is limited but you should be able to get a seat should you decide to eat your food there.  At Tejano you build your own burrito so you choose everything from the meat to the toppings.  On my particular visit I got a beef burrito which was delicious.  The meat was very tender and juicy.  I also took the spicy salsa and the level of heat was just right.  There was some kick to the burrito without it being overpowering.  I'll also add that the burrito is humongous so come here hungry because you will most certainly be full when all is said and done.  If you go for a combo then you can also get a side of their homemade tortilla chips which are wildly addictive.  It seems that they cut up corn tortillas and deep fry them.  They also have a fair amount of salt on them which probably explains why they are so good.    Prices might come across as a bit high at first but it is totally worth it.  I paid $17 for my combo but the quality was definitely there.  The portion of both the chips and burrito was also quite large so it only seemed fair to pay that much.  Another thing that Tejano does well is customer service.  The person who served me was very friendly and did a good job of engaging me in conversation while serving me quickly and efficiently.  He also made some good recommendations so he definitely knew the menu well.  As someone who enjoys a good burrito I am so glad to have found this place.  Tejano is definitely better than some of the other options available in this city."}
{"text":"Probably the biggest burrito I have ever eaten! Very tasty and almost killed myself eating it. Very small place but full all the time. Home mad chips with home made salsa. Very friendly staff, definitely recommend this place if you are really hungry or you want an excellent taco"}
{"text":"Donde es me cerveja burro?            I know, I said I was done with this 'do it yourself' food critic stuff, and was going to let Cheslee Lesterballs gouvern all recommendations as to where to eat, henceforth.      Then, Tejano opened its doors.           Yet again, the bright lights who put Cafe Griffintown on the map and hit Blackstrap BBQ out of the park, have re-invented the wheel...by filling it with pulled pork, guac, salsa, pico de gallo, a plethora of other things and folding it in a fajita.(white, or whole grain)        They especially hit the mark with the mild and spicy salsa option, as some of us have delusions of grandeur in regard to spice tolerance. And talk about authentic. Their tostadas are at par with my mexican friend's, who snorts a thimble full of her own urine as a remedy for migraines.   So, hipsters, get on your Vespa's and get to Tejano, STAT.  Waka Waka"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos! Everything is super fresh and flavorful. Go for the beef, and the spicy sauce! Only thing I would change is a little more choice when it comes to sauces/salsa."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is delicious and the staff provide helpful guidance if needed. I needed it."}
{"text":"The way it works is like at Subway: you decide on the fajita (white, brown, size -- or salad), then choose 2 out of the 3 (rice, black beans, and pinto beans). Choose a type of meat and add some fresh ingredients.   The best tex-mex burritos I've had in Montreal. And one of the rare places that got their BBQ right. The selection of BBQ meats include pulled chicken, pulled pork, pulled beef (brisket?), and some vegetarian option which I haven't tried.   The pulled pork is the best: fatty (tender), porky (taste of pork), and well seasoned. The chicken is good proteins, but chicken doesn't taste much in general, so it's easily overwhelmed by everything else in the burrito. It's for you if you don't mind sacrificing taste for health xD  The beef is dry and looks almost exactly like pulled pork... It's also supposed to be seasoned with cumin, but that failed my expectation.  The guys there are friendly, and the pricing is very fair considering the quantity (size of burrito) and quality of meat (time it takes to cook the meats low n slow).  A large burrito can fill me up for a good 12h so it gives me a good amount of time to focus on my studying."}
{"text":"My first experience of what I would qualify as true BBQ occurred a few years ago now when Blackstrap BBQ opened down in Verdun. I remember hearing about this new Southern BBQ joint opening and being interested enough to go on the first Friday they were open - getting in just before they ran out of meat - and being in awe of the level of smokiness and juiciness that the crew achieved with their meats. From that moment on, it was pretty clear to me that I would go whenever Dylan Kier and his pit mastery would go next. That thought process is what brought me a few times over the past month to his most recent project, a small burrito joint called Tejano BBQ Burrito.  Located in St-Henri right beside Bar de Courcelles and nearby many of my favorite different culinary spots - quick shout out to Campinelli, Rustique, Leche and Grumman 78 - Tejano feels primarily set up as a take out joint although there is a small sitting area with about 7 stools. The space is sparse - plain white walls with old partially sanded down wood used for the counters. Some smooth laid back music in the background. The menu printed on paper tacked above the ordering counter. The look is definitely in keeping with its older brother Blackstrap BBQ - functional and sparse with just enough of a style and vibe keeping with a southern BBQ joint.  But let's be honest - you don't go to a Burrito space for the decor. It's all about the food of course. At present, the menu is short and concise - burritos (regular and XL sized), tostadas, salads, guac, salsa and chips. For the burritos and tostadas, there are 3 meat options (smoked chicken tinga, chorizo pulled pork, rancho cumin brisket) and one vegetarian (black beans and hominy). Once you make your selection of a base, you can add either re-fried beans, black beans and hominy (if you went with a meat) and/or rice then a collection of different vegetables (pico de gallo, red onions, radishes, jalapeños, peppers, corn, etc...) followed by cheese, fresh lime juice, house guacamole, hot sauce and/or sour cream.  In terms of the burritos, all those options leave you with a fully stuffed burrito and a rather filling one as well. I tried both the pulled pork and the brisket options in burrito form. In keeping with Dylan's work at Blackstrap BBQ, the quality of the meats is impeccable. The pulled pork has that little heat from the chorizo and is wonderfully tender and juicy. The brisket is the same with just a subtle touch of the cumin which gives off a smokier element than the pork. In terms of the other ingredients, I enjoyed both bean options although I'm not sure I would enjoy a black bean and hominy burrito on its own - a meatless burrito just seems wrong to me. All the vegetables are fresh and crisp. Loved the creaminess of the guacamole although I'm not a huge fan of it being the only ingredient that costs extra to add in. Overall, excellent burritos that would be a regular lunch option for me if I worked anywhere nearby (which I don't sadly in this case).  The new menu item for me here was the Tostada which I had never heard of before. Basically, a burrito bowl - all the same ingredients pilled over top a crispy tortilla shell. The crisp shell was good but honestly, other than the texture change with that crispiness, it's not all that different from the burrito. A different presentation but given how I loved the burritos, I think I'll stick to those personally.  Reasonable price, good quality and quantity of food and quick service - All in all, Dylan, Clara and Co. have a great concept going with Tejano BBQ Burrito. It has only been open for about a month now but given what I've enjoyed, I suspect we will hear about this spot a lot more and very quickly in this new year. That particular corner of St-Henri is quickly becoming one of my favourite areas to enjoy food wise... I think i'll be visiting even more often in 2015!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually go in person. We had a yelp event next door (dodgebow. Go check it out!) and this restaurant provides us with a nice supper.   We got build your own tacos. There were soft taco shells, chicken, beef, bean mix, Guac, three types of sauces, chips, corn, salsa, lettuce and cheese.   Chicken was good, some tendons though. Beef was a little dry. Beans were great, guac was delicious. Corn, salsa, lettuce and cheese were normal.   One of the sauces was the spicy sauce. Now, in the kind of person who always orders the hottest thing on the menu and I've never been satisfied by the level of spiciness. I was finally pleasantly surprised. After a bite of my taco, I felt the nice familiar burn on my tongue. Simply wonderful!   Finally, the chips. Wow. Wow wow wow wow wow. You'd think \"meh, regular old tortilla chips, whatever.\" WRONG! They were the most crunch, delicious, crispy, perfectly salted chips I've ever had! Only downside is that in order to achieve this level of deliciousness, (I presume that) they used A LOT of oil. My hands were oily after eating the chips. Totally worth it though.   All in all, I am definitely headed over there when I get the chance!"}
{"text":"Excellent take out spot. Their burritos and salads are super filling. Half a burrito for lunch could do the trick but I rather eat the whole thing. No judgment please. You have a vegetarian choice, pulled pork, chicken or beef. I had them all except for the beef. I'm a fan of the vegetarian version, it help me to believe it's an healthy choice The choices of toping is interesting and I'd say classic. The service is always friendly. Prices are ok for the quality. It's mainly a take out place but they have a few seats. You should stop by:)"}
{"text":"Pratique fast food avec des bons ingredients, grosses portions et place clean. Grande fenetre avec petit comptoir. Ca goute bon, pour 10-13$ plus taxes vous êtes bourrés."}
{"text":"Tejano is good, but a bit of a chaotic mess, much like the insides of their burritos. Tejano can claim the title of Montreal's best burritos however they do so without any real competition.   My third visit to Tejano was on a Saturday night @6:30ish in the evening and I was greeted by a lineup winding out the door.   Total time to get an $11+ burrito w/ guac to-go: 18 minutes.   If you get a soda and side of chips and guacamole you're looking at $17+ before taxes... which is rather on the high side but the cost issue comes secondary to the logistical mess.  Considering that they had 5-6 staff and the line, including those being served, was maybe 8-10 people, 18 minutes is a rather problematic wait.   Every time I have visited Tejano the food has been good, good but not great. The choose your own adventure/subway model of burrito selection leads to a burrito that is a chaotic, relatively self-generated, mess lacking the guidance of wisdom that we look to a skilled chef for.   This model makes a mess not only of the burritos, but also undermines the staffs ability to both produce food in a timely fashion, and to produce the best product for their customers. Every customers is slowly, blindly, fumbling through their experience, slowing down the flow of the restaurant and mucking up the ability of the restaurant to artful combine what are excellent ingredients.   What we end up with is decent burrito undermined by the chaotic assortment of things we have packed into it, and a restaurant undermined by the haphazard way that customers are packed in and served.   The simple signage is cute, but is culprit number one undermining the restaurant. A default set of ingredients for each burrito (like Vera's Burger Shack) would maintain the freedom that Tejano's currently has, while speeding up the ordering process, and allowing Tejano's staff to better guide people towards something they would really like."}
