{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on a Friday. Got seated right away. I had the vegetarian skillet and my boyfriend had the gyro skillet. Eggs were cooked perfectly, and it was a great meal. The waitress was great and very attentive. There are lots of options on the menu and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"Such a variety of a menu Sunday was Prime Rib for $13.99. I have never ate here. I asked for medium when I got it a good size but looked like they put on the grill-bad sign & dried out. I tried and taste was really off so asked my husband to taste and he agreed was terrible. I asked for replacement it was all they had. They said they would give me a steak to replace which ribeye was the same price. I was brought a sirloin that had gristle throughout the piece & never saw our waitress again."}
{"text":"I just had the worst experience at this place.  The waitress, Kay, obviously hates her job.  Not entirely sure why she works as a waitress because she is really not good at it.  She is condescending and rude.  She never smiled and acted like we were bothering her when we asked her for things.  Excuse me, isn't that your job to fill up my water glass???  Oh wait, no it's not because she never filled it up!!  She was just awful!!

The food was dry and just as bad as the waitress.  If you are looking for a place to eat in Monticello do not go here.  There are way better options in this great town.  

This place is very expensive for what it is too.  For an order of 2 pancakes with sausage it was $25.00.  When I questioned it, they got very defensive and treated us really bad.  They told us \"you will pay for what you ordered!!\"  Then they went through the list of everything they charged us.  Warning: They will charge you for everything they can,  Watch what you ask for because they will charge you for it.

They never once tried to be understanding or so say sorry.  They were defensive and mean.  I don't like mean people so I will not go back to that hostile environment again and I would encourage anyone else considering it to NOT go."}
{"text":"Cute railroad theme. They have a heck of an after-chuch crowd and the food is down-home country cooking. Quite tasty. Nice service staff, fairly attentive. Home-ish."}
{"text":"Good casual restaurant.  Food is uneven.  Breakfast best meal.  The problem is this, I think, chain tries to offer too many things, making it hard to be good at much.   Still, a nice place to go where everyone wants something different.  Wait staff very attentive - usually no wait to get a seat.  Near Interstate exit.

Big area for groups.   I think if you stick to basic food, you will be happy."}
{"text":"I was in Monticello for business and was staying at the Best Western across the parking lot.  I had read the reviews on this place and was not optimistic but I wanted a quick dinner and didn't want to drive to Champaign.  
I ordered one of the Monday specials which was the rib eye.  I was expecting a skinny little rib eye steak.  I was craving red meat and didn't care...  This steak came out and the first words out of my mouth were \"Yabba Dabba Do\".  The steak was huge!  I cut a small piece off the end and it was delicious.  I cut through the middle and it was actually super rare/raw.  The waitress took it back apologetically to have it cooked.  This was her first day on the job and she did great, very sweet and attentive.  Steak came back out cooked to perfection.  I'd go back in a heart beat. Friendly staff and extremely reasonable pricing, especially for the portion size."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times.  We have a dear friend that likes to eat here.  When a friend is offering to treat you to dinner, you can't really argue about where you are going to dine, at least not in this case.  Anyway, while I appreciated the gesture, this place is not one of my favorites.  I have had way worse, but I have definitely had better.  

As I have mentioned in other reviews, I am a strict vegetarian (vegan) so my options are often limited, especially at a restaurant such as this.  I often end up with fries or a plain baked potato and a salad at many places, including this one.  As far as salads go the ones I have had here are alright, but nothing special and mostly made up of iceberg lettuce.  Their french fries have got to be your run of the mill frozen crinkle cuts that you see at most any place that doesn't make their own.  I can just picture the bag in my head that would read \"Gordon Food Service...\"  

My friend and husband seem to enjoy enjoy their meals when we have been here.  Usually prime rib.  Just, from my perspective though, the vegetables on the side looked pathetic-obviously previously frozen, watery and mushy looking broccoli, etc.  

There is a main dining room which is brightly lit or you can sit in the larger bar area which is darker and more comfortable.  Both sides have always been dead when we were there though.  The ambiance is a little lacking and seems disconnected, but it's hard for me to put it into words.  Too open??  In any case, not especially comfortable to me.  The jukebox never seems to be working right either so I had to get refunds.  

So, you won't starve here and it's alright just not something I am super excited about or would recommend to a friend.  Like I said, if it were up to me, this wouldn't be my first choice.  I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but I doubt this would be Gordon Ramsay approved...  It could be greatly improved with some fresh vegetables and less frozen stuff.  In my case, the company of my husband and friend made it alright.  I wasn't there for the food.  Just to catch up and have a good time among ourselves.  And I did mention they have a bar, right?  =)"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and good, but the hot turkey sandwich lacked any sort of flavor. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"You could probably make better breakfast food at home.  Food was bland.  Good portion size for your money, though!"}
{"text":"Don't even bother, it's nasty! Old grease, nothing potatoes was cooked right! Lettuce salad not fresh and was plain. Fish was appealing to the eye, golden brown but was raw and slimiest ever on the inside!Waited at cash registers 10 minutes, no one in site. Will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Los Angeles but recently visited Monticello, IL to re-locate his parents for retirement.

We stayed at the Best Western, so eating at the Red Wheel was pretty simple, being that they share a parking lot and all.  We ate at the Red Wheel about 3-4 times.  The staff was friendly, the breakfasts were hearty and good and very good prices!  My hubby and I had a late-night cheeseburger there at 8:30pm and it was delicious.  So if you are looking for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat that's not a drive-through, I would actually recommend the Red Wheel.  :)"}
{"text":"Food was decent but everything was overpriced. Fries weren't included with meal, staff was less than average & cheese sticks were too small."}
