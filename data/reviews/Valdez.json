{"text":"I am from Venezuela. I went to this place 2 weeks ago and I really had a nice time. I tried to go again tonight and they didn't let me go in because I didn't have a Canadian ID or my passport. I was rejected because I didn't have a Canadian ID, when I am 27 year old! I think this is very discriminating and even more when they are supposed to be a LATIN club! We tried to talk to the manager and they he insulted us! And the bouncer call our friend \"maldita puta\" the ones that understand Spanish know what that means!"}
{"text":"Food portions are very small, and very overpriced.  Was underwhelmed with the tacos, meatballs ,guac and cevice. Nothing special. However the Mojitos were delivious and the patio is lovely. Will be back for a drink only."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious and fun restaurants in the city. Get a seat at the bar in front of the kitchen for an almost show like experience with your meal. I always come back here as a consistent go to place for fun and delicious food."}
{"text":"I only ordered drinks, but boy was I disappointed with their  mojito. It was way too sweet, it was like  the mint was just thrown in and nothing was muddled. Being a Latin inspired restaurant you'd think this is something they wouldn't mess up. I decided to have rum and cokes for the rest of the night. 

The ambiance is nice though..."}
{"text":"Valdez accommodated our group (6 people) very well last night. We had a table from about 6-8 pm in a booth opposite the kitchen. 

Our server was perfect - she made excellent suggestions, refreshed our drinks and water at the right time, and was never \"in your face\" or a ghost, like some servers tend to be. In short, she was a consummate professional. I hope we get her again when we visit next time!

We decided, as a group, to get the \"Street Party\", which is essentially a tasting menu for $45 per person. The chips and guacamole were great, but the ceviches really were outstanding. I can't recall all of the names of the dishes... However I really enjoyed the tuna ceviche. After the many appetizers, we got a taste of a few of their mains, and finished with some delicious desserts. We were brought plenty of food, and left full and satisfied. Our server made sure to get us a second round of drinks while they were still on special, which was thoughtful of her. 

Originally I was somewhat unhappy that we weren't able to secure a table for 7 pm (we settled for 6 pm seating), the drink special made up for it. 

Overall, I'd recommend the Street Party tasting menu. It was definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Nice space and fun drinks however they're customer service is really lacking and I probably won't come back here. They really cant handle volume as was apparent during the World Cup. The hostesses were rude and condescending when I asked a question about why there was an empty table when it was apparently standing room only. Not to mention a previous time when the server didnt bring our drinks or even check in on us after i had to ask for our drinks twice. There are way better options in the city compared to Valdez."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food and cocktails (skip the tomale- too much masa, not enough brisket filling and under seasoned). The service was good but I think there's such thing as over attentive. I think the waitress came over 10 times to try to take the bag with the empanadas off the table. There was one left- we eventually took it out so she could take it off the table. Also it's hard to enjoy the restaurant and have a conversation if the waitress is checking up every 5 minutes. This could be how the wait staff is instructed to work and may be due to personal preference- although it did take 20-30 minutes to wait for drink orders."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great atmosphere, great service! The restaurant is very modern, and spacious. I like the vibe there and the music sets the mood. They place nice Latin music in the main dining area and crank it up in the bathroom, so you want to take an extra min in there and just dance away :-) Our server was very friendly and explained everything in detail. We had shrimp ceviche to start, as well as their winning guacamole with various chips, and wontons stuffed with cream cheese and guava paste, yum! For the main, we shared their fried rice with duck which comes in a nice sizzling hot plate (the portion is huge!). For dessert we shared a dark chocolate warm Peruvian mouse/cake, double yum. I would definitely come back again and try their mojitos on the patio (we sat inside this time)."}
{"text":"We arrived early for our reservation so we went to the upstairs patio to have a quick drink. The price of the drinks is pretty standard for the area and they do have better flavour than some other more hyped places around. My only issue with the cocktails is that when you order the 1L option they overdo it with the amount of ice and seem to replace booze with the ice.

The service was friendly and we did not experience any speed issues ... sometimes a bit too eager to take away your almost finished drink in order to get you the next one. You should not do it without asking if you are done with your drink, particularly at these prices.

Great atmosphere and fantastic music downstairs. I just wish the lights were not so dim as their menu is not that easy to read. We sat there for two quite lengthy stays and did not find the chairs uncomfortable.

I was pleased with the flavour in the dishes that were supposed to be spicy. They are the right level of heat with a good mix of interesting combinations (unlike some places that are afraid of adding heat and spices to appeal to patrons looking for extra-bland food).

The style is more tapas-like and I appreciate it when exploring (although there are some main dishes as well that we have yet to try). But if you go this way, make sure to also order one of the larger dishes to share so that you get a good amount of food. I found the \"Chaufa\" to be great for flavour as well and being quite filling (the first time we gladly took the half we couldn't finish home). It also accompanied well the falvours of the meatballs and the choripapa.

I have been twice and comparing against similar places in the area and other places in Toronto that offer the same type of experience, I am very happy in terms of the quality and price paid for it. We will go back to explore more of their tapas-style offerings and eventually move to their bigger dishes.

Two issues ... last time the whole electronic payment service was down due to a lightning strike related failure, and it took a long time to have it back up (going to an ATM was not an option since those were also affected in the area). We did not mind having to wait, but at least some complimentary treatment while we waited was expected. Yet, we didn't even get our glasses of water re-filled.

The second issue is that they seem to have a high opinion on their service despite the actual individual quality. I understand that for a large group it is sometimes a default to pre-calculate the tip at 18%. However, in this place, regardless of size, their default in the machines is 18% and I do not think that is a good practice or message. Let the customer decide."}
{"text":"Have loved this restaurant from the first time I tried their ceviches! I've been back multiple times and have been impressed each time. Chef Gonzalez is creative and always has great features that are sure to impress - from the chorizo to the arepas, there's something for everyone. It also helps that the atmosphere is fun and entertaining. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service. However, the calamari portion wasn't worth the price tag it came with. If you are hungry this isn't the place to be.
**The calamari was malnourished looking and on a cheap bed of greens, quality is not there. **"}
{"text":"Just yum. So so tasty and great service! All staff were knowledgeable on what they were serving and were super attentive. A little pricey but done really well."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Great atmosphere, beautiful decor and deliscious food !
I've been here a couple of times over the last two months as I'm often in the area. There have been so many trendy taco places popping up in Toronto over the last year that the city has become oversaturated with them. I'm SO HAPPY to see a NICE restaurant that serves Latin American food and not only mexican tacos, burritos & quesadillas ! (not that I have anything against those, just too many)

I've tried most of the things in the appertizers or 'tapas' section, and they are pretty good, especially the chorizo, the guac & the the chuzos a la plancha. 

I haven't yet sampled their cocktails but I plan on doing that very soon ! They usually play some upbeat latin infused beats to get you in the mood for a night out. If you are looking for a quiet and serene dinner, this is not the palce to go !"}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday for dinner and were pleasantly surprised to discover it was half price wine night.  We ordered the pinot noir, the Salva Trucha ceviche (which was an enormous portion for $6), the empanadas ( 3 plus  dipping sauce for $7), the Arepitas which were like tiny crisp corn pancakes and the  Chori Papa which was our favourite of the night.  While we both agree that the empanadas had a bready, creamy corn coating we liked them and didn't regret ordering them.  I would probably pass on the arepitas in the future.    The service was incredibly friendly and the prices were easy on the pocketbook.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Shit customer service and shit attitude. These punk kids try to run the place like its the third reich. Not happy with what was once a place to have fun. Grow up and recognize patronage where it's due."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting to report here. 

Large, loud space with horrible seating (backless stools that are incredibly uncomfortable to sit in for any extended period of time). 

We went on a Saturday night. The bartender was lovely as we waited for our table but  once seated service was non-existant. It was probably some of the worst service I've had in a while. We sat with squid ink all over our plates for 20 minutes, unable to use our plates for the shared dishes, as new food was served from the kitchen (we were seated at the \"chef's table\", which is really just a bar area around the open kitchen, so food was served by the kitchen on the fly). 

Food wasn't horrible but really not exciting or interesting. Overprice guac and chips (though the selection of chips was wonderful), a pretty decent ceviche, boring steak kebabs, underwhelming chorizo, some nice arepas, ok croquettes and a pork main dish that was decent but incredibly overpriced at $18. 

Not the worst but I'd skip it."}
{"text":"This is one of worst restaurant in Toronto!! (1) Waitress and front staff was so rude (2) they tell you need to leave after 2 hour sitting (even if there vacant tables) (3) Food is blah! Stay away. Not worth the money and the line-up specially if you have shitty service from the people who works there.  Am not bitter !! Am just relating to my actual experience."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had since moving to Toronto! The ceviche was to die for! I highly recommend the tuna and scallops. Do not leave without trying the chori papa. Great service, great food and great vibe!"}
{"text":"Valdez is so over rated. The food sucks and the service is worse. Try cava or playa cabana for legit Latin food."}
{"text":"Partial review:

Steve's food menu is equally lively and approachable, with an emphasis on sharable plates for the table. There were five different ceviches to choose from, a section for street food inspired tapas-type dishes, larger share-worthy platters and a few classic desserts. While the appetizers (called \"Stuff\" on the menu) stuck fairly closely to the Latin theme, I noticed a little bit of fusion going on with the mains (referred to as  \"More\") where Italian, Asian and American influences seemed to sneak their way in.  While we would have loved to had tried the famed Adobe Pork, we didn't come equipped with a party of 8, nor did we give the required 48 hour notice, so decided on a nice little spread of:
 
Chips & Guac- Plantain, Yucca, Taro, Potato Chips with Guacamole ($8)
Simple but very good. Each of the root vegetable chips had their own unique flavour, but all retained a super crispy texture and were evenly salted for an addictive-cant-stop-myself effect. I also really liked the guacamole, which had a nice creamy texture and well seasoned. Kind of a small portion for the price, but a tasty starter to share regardless.
 
Croquetas- Rice, Chicken, Peppers, Saffron Stuffed Croquetas served with Chipotle Aioli ($6)
These were much like a Latin take on arancini served with aioli instead of tomato sauce. Admittedly, I couldn't really detect much of the promised chicken myself, but I don't think I really missed it. Now, had the menu promised juicy pulled pork or some spicy chorizo or maybe a little braised beef in there, then yes, I would have been upset. Protein aside, I liked how crispy they were on the outside, but found them a little dense and dry within. But thankfully with enough of the spicy creamy aioli (which was wickedly addictive by-the-way), it was still a tasty bite.
 
Fried Empanadas- Cornmeal Crust, stuffed with Pork, Potato, L5S with Aji Sauce ($9)
While unlike most empanadas I've had elsewhere (where sometimes the dough is too dense and thick), I really liked the light mildly sweet light cornmeal crust of these. My only quibble was that the filling may have been a touch underseasoned. Having said that, like the croquetas, the spicy hot pepper dip swooped in to save the day, and definitely added that hit of flavour I was looking for.

Pastel- Cream Cheese & Guava Paste stuffed in a Fried Wonton ($6)
Unusual, but surprisingly addictive, these little bites provided the ultimate sweet and savoury sensation. The wonton was light and very crispy, seasoned generously with coarse salt, and when you bit in you got the tangy bite of the cream cheese, sweetened by the fruity paste. If I were walking around and saw these sold on the streets, I would get a few bags and call it lunch (or breakfast or dinner or dessert).

Chuzos al Plancha- Beef Skewers with Chimichurri and Arepas ($7 x 2)

While I found the beef flavourful on its own, albeit a touch tough, I really liked the lively and fresh addition of the chimichurri. I also loved the texture of the pillowy arepa, but I found it could have used a little salt or spice. No biggie. A quick little rub-a-dub-dub in the chimichurri and voila, once again, I was good to go.
 
Atun Japones- Ahi Tuna, Watermelon, Radish, Ponzu, Pickled Ginger and Pear ($17)

I really enjoyed this unique take on ceviche because it had a lot of big bold flavours that didn't rely so heavily on onions (which I don't always like). The watermelon and pear were sweet and refreshing, while the ginger was tangy and aromatic. I also liked the little bit of pungent radish in there to balance out the fruit flavours and keep the dish in the realm of savoury. Maybe a little pricy for the size, but if I were feeling like a big spender, I would actually like to return sometime to try more of the ceviches.
 
Giggy's Trout- Togarashi, Quinoa, Yuzu, Mango, Avocado & Fried Shallots ($17)
The trout was seasoned beautifully and cooked to yield a perfectly crispy skin, but I found the sweet, tart flavour of the yuzu and mango in the quinoa a little overwhelming. I also found it made the grain a little too wet on the plate. Having said that, fried shallots? Yum! I am going to start putting salty crispy slightly sweet shallots on everything I eat. Starting... NOW!
 
Pupusa- Cornflour Pupusa stuffed with Gruyere & Mushrooms topped with Cabbage Slaw and Sundried Tomato Sauce ($13)
The pupusa itself had a nice flavour and I liked digging in to reveal the stringy salty cheese and savoury mushrooms, but the sundried tomato sauce just kind of threw me off.  I think using sundried tomatoes (that's had its sugars concentrated) made the sauce little too sweet for the already somewhat sweet corn-meal based pupusa. I think all the dish needed was more heat and a creamy element to balance it out- maybe that chipotle aioli we dried with the croquetas would have....."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this place.  I have been here before and really enjoyed it, until today. I was rejected because of my Venezuelan ID, the bouncer claimed they had changed their policy two months. Ironically I was there two weeks before and had no problem at all. Which seems very ridiculous. They claimed you need a Canadian ID or your passport, which seems ridiculous because it's not safe to go clubbing with your passport."}
{"text":"Although I have yet to try the food, I will definitely come back to Valdez. Some new coworkers and I came here to celebrate the end of our week-long training program and we had a blast! We made a wise decision and called ahead... It was packed. I couldn't believe they accommodated almost 20 of us! We celebrated with some drinks and let loose with the fun Latin music. Salsa might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would love to come back and see if their dining experience has just as much to offer as their upstairs nightlife."}
{"text":"Came to Valdez with my wife this past saturday.
We arrived earlier than our reservation but they didn't ask us to wait and seated us right away.
The service was VERY good. Was quick, friendly and professional.
The waitress knew the menu very well and answered all our questions.

The food we ordered came SUPER quick and was very very good.
Now I've read some of the reviews below, especially people stating it's not authentic or it's not good tasting. I would really like to know what the heck they ordered. I'm not Latin, so I can't speak about authenticity, but the flavours were great and we loved every dish we ordered. For me, taste trumps authenticity.
Authentic doesn't make something taste good, lol.

Regardless, we had the empanadas, fried chicken wings, chori papa tortillas and the shortribs. As I said everything was great with the Chori Papa being the stand out Yummifier. (trademarking this! lol)
Amazing.

Their Margarita was perfect, not watered down as in most places. (and they charged us less than the menu price, yay)

All in all, we will definitely be coming back.
The food, service and atmosphere were all on par or better. Keep it up Valdez!"}
{"text":"The upstairs patio is covered, which makes it a bit stuffy in the summer. It's not really meant for standing space either, so it's not a great place to hang out. That's one star down.

The music below is not bad, but the drinks are mediocre, which makes this place lose another star for me."}
{"text":"My fav food of all time! Whatever you pick from their menu I guarantee you you will not go wrong. The empanadas, arepas, chorizo, just ridiculous. I always leave there wanting more :)"}
{"text":"Great vibe, super friendly staff and amazing food! Went here for drinks and tapas and I've been itching to go back ever since!!"}
{"text":"This place got a nice vibe. And good for small group to hang out.  The music does get a little loud if you try to chat. 
The fried rice is our favorite.  We also tried the platter.
. The platter is good for sharing but  combination is a bit dry overall."}
{"text":"Interesting crowd, I guess better than most of the places on King West... still, basically a sea of gingham shirts. They serve Tecate which is a plus, but it is $8 for a tall can (again, could be worse..?). Hostesses are a bit intense, but I suppose not outright unfriendly. Small plates of course, very quick and all that. Sat on upstairs patio and the music was fun, although we were at the table RIGHT beside the DJ and it was a bit loud. Swordfish is pretty dope. A little bit \"hip\" for my tastes overall."}
{"text":"The seating seems to be zoned based on sound level. My group was seated near the back of the restaurant which is considerably more spacious and quiet, so it was easier to chat. Near the front of the restaurant seems to be more rowdy and energetic, and the seating in front of the open kitchen/bar is great too if you want to see the cooks in action.

No one in my group had been to Valdez before, so we went with most of the helpful suggestions of our server. We ordered the mo-tio litre cocktail, tiradito ceviche, matambre, maduro, and chaufa. For dessert, we shared arroz con coco, and helado de coco. The tiradito ceviche was very interesting because it was salty and sweet at the same time. The matambre was standard fare, nice and pink on the inside. You can skip the maduro, it wasn't anything to write home about. What you need to get for sure though is the chaufa, because it was an explosion in flavour and aroma. Both desserts were a nice cool down to balance the spiciness of the mains.

Overall, service is excellent, and the food choices and quality was quite good. Some dishes are a bit expensive, resulting in lower value than ideal, but I guess that's to be expected on King Street. There's also a tasting menu and a rooftop patio that I would like to try in the summer."}
{"text":"I've been going here ever since it opened when it didn't yet establish an identity in King West. It has evolved but has stuck to its original theme of latino food and music! The atmosphere now is just a lot more fun!

The food is great, the drinks are great, the music is great. To top off, they usually have a dance floor upstairs and the it is just......sexy. Latinos know how to dance!"}
{"text":"I just got back from this place and I had such a HORRIBLE experience that I made an account here to give negative feedback for the first time ever.

I normally don't comment on restaurants, they're either good or \"meh\". But this place was SO bad that I felt the need to share.

My friends and I are the least picky people ever. We appreciate good food if it costs 10 dollars or 100 dollars. We LOVE latin food that we decided to try this place out.

We made reservations for a friends birthday tonight and the experience was brutal from the get-go.  Going to summarize:

-hostesses could not even offer a smile when walking in
-waitress had some sort of attitude when not everyone was ready to order (we were waiting for people)
-food mediocre at best (WAY overpriced considering the taste vs other awesome places like la carnita/grand electric/milagro)
-we got charged for TAP WATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (first time for me!)
-we brought our own bday cake. the staff cut it for us for a TWENTY (20!!) dollar \"cake cutting\" fee. WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT? Not only did we get charged for it, they brought out 5 HUGE slices of cake, and the rest were tiny bit size slivers of cake because they did not count how many people were at the table. if you are going to charge that AT LEAST FUCKING COUNT how many slices you need
-the waitress refused to split the bill so we had to take a calculator out and calculate what each person owed ourselves
-on top of all of these, a mandatory 18 percent gratuity fee was charged. for shitty service, shitty food

I am actually shocked at my experience at this place. All of our restaurants we visit come from recommendations/hearsay. I am going to make sure I tell everyone I know to avoid this disgusting excuse for a restaurant. I understand businesses are there to make money, but a charge for tap water, birthday cake CUTTING, and shitty service? They couldve at least offered a smile.

Brutal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for valentines day for their fixed price menu. I can't remember exactly what we ate but what stood out to me was that they had an abundance of gluten free items since corn is primarily used over wheat in this cuisine. It was a lot of food! I would highly recommend this place especially if you have gluten issues!"}
{"text":"I agree about the really koolness of the place. THAT'S IT!

I'm vegan. I hate it when restaurant throw stupid small dumb content in their menus saying \"Vegan options\" and think we are not humans or something. Like we don't eat!
I can eat! As much as I love to cook like the iron chefs, I loooooove to eat. So, if a place throws down \"Vegan Options\", i'm expecting something just as good as a regular joe getting his/her regular dish. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...not true.

I spoke to the \"wonderful\" (being sarcastic) server about my veganism and what are my options for appetizers. She said only Yucca Fritta. I thought, \"i do love those so i'll try their Yuccas\", which the server literally oozed nothing but greatness over the Yuccas. I asked her what are my options in Entree's and she said i can only have the \"la la beans\". I have no clue what she just said but it sounded hella exotic and she swear by it that it is amazingly \"FLAVORFUL\", which she kept repeating to me about it. So i decided to order that too.

My Yucca arrived. The most boring Yuccas i ever had. I rather fly to Cuba and bust down one of the resort to have them Yuccas! I didn't bother finishing my Yuccas although they were $6 for a lil tiny dish of it. I think i counted 5 Yuccas. Anyhoooo, proceeeed....

My Entree arrived....
Whatever that server said was beyond FUBAR! She put down a bowl of white rice and a small bowl of black beans. THAT'S IT! Girl ran off like speed lighting before i can fathom what she just gave me!! I'm sitting there waiting for more cuz she left hella fast after placing 2 of those small dishes down in front of me. I'm waiting....waiting....and my hubby looks at me and says, \"I think that's your dish, baby\". I was in denial. I refused to think that that's all i'm having, but....alas....it was. She never came around. I ate a little bit and thought, that damn server lied! This is not flavourful! It just taste like black beans and white rice!!

I didn't bother to finish. We got the bill. My entree was $13 for black beans and rice. My appetizer was $6. I had a $20 dinner that i felt really ripped off. All in all, don't let stupid restaurant suck you in when it says \"Vegan options\". It's usually just a gimmick. I rather go to Disgraceland and have a vegan rib dinner, which IS FLAVORFUL! Not going back ever nor recommend that place to anyone. Enough said."}
{"text":"What if you fried rice with duck fat? Served some good cocktails? And build a great patio? What do you have? A great place to drink and a eat. Highly recommended. Some things to consider, lines can get long, so go early or be ready to wait. 
Wait staff is awesome, ask for their favourite and popular drinks and dishes. Not everything on the menu is a gold star standout. For example, the Sangria is nice, but not worth it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous space, prompt service.  We were a large group, so it took a while for our food to come out, but when it did, it was tasty.  It's not very authentic (the menu is a mishmash of South and Central American dishes, with several non-traditional ingredients: sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese), but the food is very filling and beautifully presented."}
{"text":"Great place amazing food, it's a explosion of flavors on every bite, drinks are a little pricey for what you get but the rest is pretty good..."}
{"text":"Here for my second time and this time we sat right in front of the kitchen in the \"hot seats\". It was a great experience! These guys put out lots of food very quickly and it all looked and smelled amazing! Very fun and interesting. We had a few dishes and all very good. My favourites are the ceviche and the \"chorrie papa\".  Excellent food and great drinks. I definitely recommend the hot seats!"}
{"text":"OK, my steamed branzino was very good. Tasted like it just came out of the ocean.
But we laughed at the minuscule portions of ceviche and were never given bread. So that amounted two two bites over the 90 minutes before the entree was served.
This is a place for young people who want to be trendy. The first priority is to sell them pricey cocktails, the second seems to be to get the noise level up to ridiculous levels so that conversation becomes all but impossible at the table. Food is an afterthought.
After almost three hours in the babble I left feeling a little hungry and found the crowded King West on a busy Friday night to be an oasis of peace and quiet."}
{"text":"Food - Everything  was bland except the guava mix sauce. Not my idea of Latino cuisine which needs to be packed with flavor.

Service - Good

Ambiance - Excellent   

Price - Dinner for two costed $60 for one appetizer and two entrees with gratuity


When the Latino food falls short in taste, does anything else matter?"}
{"text":"Valdez is not so different from its King West neighbours in terms of price and hype. It is expensive but it's talked about with a lot of interest. But does it live up to the expectations surrounding it? Not really. The portions are just okay for the price and the actual food and drinks are just okay. Today I tried it all; okay.. most of it! - drinks and food on the patio upstairs and the same downstairs, both of which have different menus. I agree with a lot of other reviewers on here that the food generally lacks seasoning. Not sure what's up with that. Maybe that detail got lost among the huge operation that is Valdez. Guac and chips, chorizo, empanadas and fried rice. All the dishes felt unique in certain ways but they didn't blow me out of the water in terms of taste. The drinks were good. The service was generally good. The location is prime and the patio is pretty great. Valdez appears to stand alone in offering Latino street food in a high-volume, centrally-located restaurant. If you're looking for a fun night out in King West and are okay with food that is just okay, then this might be your jam."}
{"text":"Amazing food, they've got the right idea, rooftop patio is perfect a there's less duct from card, the menu and design were really thought out well. The papas Fritos were the best I've had in the city yet"}
{"text":"Food was good (I wouldn't say it was fantastic...but good). I recommend the pastels (they are sweet), and definitely try the flight of ceviche! The service was fantastic! Our waitress was very attentive and everytime we left to go to the washroom, our napkins were refolded and chairs tucked in. A nice touch!!! The atmosphere is great! good for a date night, especially if you like trying new foods. A bit pricey, but not unreasonable. Just make sure you are mentally adding up the cost, there are many small plates. Overall, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Super delish cranberry mojito. Love it! Such a lovely menu with a variety of options. It's like being at the hottest club in Santo Domingo without leaving the 6ix! Olé!"}
{"text":"I went with a large party, so I was able to try a lot of items. My conclusion for the menu is that it's more misses than hits. Nothing tasted truly horrible; a few dishes were delicious. But mostly, the food hovers around the mediocre point. 

I'll go in order of taste, not when it came to the table:

The Tres Leches Pudding (dessert) had an off-putting taste. Might have been the coconut with the banana with the mango... Kind of explains the weird flavour. Don't think anyone had more than just a bite of it. It also left an unforgettable aftertaste. 

The Yucca Fritta was super bland, and the mayo that came with it tasted like Hellman's. 

The Empanadas were hard and the filling didn't have a lot of flavour nor did the shell. 

The Croquetas were also bland and didn't leave much of an impression. Was something that we tasted and moved onto the next. 

I personally didn't love the Helado de Salpicon, which is a popsicle-like dessert. It's refreshing at first, especially after a heavy meal. However, after more than just a few bites/licks, I've had more than enough. It's a good palate cleanser though. 

The Sizzling Fajita was underwhelming. It tasted OK, even though there was way too many bell peppers. But really, it doesn't taste like it's $25 worth. 

We also had the Bandeja which had pork, rice, beans and pork belly. I almost forgot about this dish: that's how memorable it was. You can probably make this one at home yourself. 

Good appetizer to start with is the Chips & Guac. I liked the guacamole, and there are five different types of chips that it came with. Good to share.

The Chuzos Al Plancha beef skewers were good. The meat was just pink with the hit of fresh beef flavour you'd want in something that's slightly rare. But still nothing spectacular. It's not a dish that you'd go to Valdez especially for. 

I enjoyed the Choco Cafe with its strong chocolate flavour. Best part is that it wasn't too sweet, so you can really have more than just one bite. Out of the three desserts I tried, this is the top. 

I recommend trying the Braised Short Ribs. The meat was literally falling off the bones, and the sauce didn't overwhelm the natural meat flavours. And the accompanying Gratin was creamy, slightly cheesy, and very yummy.

Another \"hit\" dish was the Pastels, which were fried cream-cheese wontons. The unexpected sweet guava might throw you off, but it's creatively flavourful. 

The Chaufa is a must-try because it features lots of good flavours melding together. The gamey duck really played off well with the chili spiciness. The only thing is that it might have been a tad too salty. But this was the clear winner of the night. 

As for the setting, it sets a happy vibe for larger parties because the music was good and the decor was casual. Overall, welcoming atmosphere. Our servers were friendly and attentive. 

Would I visit this place again? No. The food didn't impress me too much. While the fried wontons and fried duck rice were delicious, it's not enough to draw me back in."}
{"text":"I don't get why everyone's so excited about this place. We were at Tio's Patio a couple of weekends ago and not only did we leave smelling like food, we also left very unsatisfied (first thought: I wish Yelp allowed zero stars).

The food is mediocre at best. The beef tostada was cold, tough and tasteless. The chorizo, on the other hand, was so salty it made us fear for our lives. The calamari was meh. And the beet salad was nothing special either.

Service. Well you can tell they were working you only for the tip. I mean, we don't have to be friends man. Just simple, efficient, respectful service is enough. 

We should have known it won't be a great night the moment we stepped through the front doors. There must have been 4 or 5 people waiting to block you from entering. I was sure the goal was to assist but it came off as awfully condescending. 

The patio did have a great view and an upbeat vibe with the DJ and bright cheery chairs and cushions but seriously, there are better place you can be."}
{"text":"the menu is quite decent, but none of the items we ordered truly wowed any of us (group of 4). I don't expect anything earth shattering, but there are tons of awesome places to eat in Toronto, and I just kept thinking that we could have probably gone somewhere else better, especially at that price range. The ambience is nice, but the yelp rating of \"meh\" is actually quite accurate here. 

We each had an order of the ceviche, which could have used some more actual chunks of fish. 
The chips and quac were quite good because they use veggie chips, and the guac is tasty. 
As others have noted, the pastels are fun and delicious. Cheese and fried stuff. Yum. 
The chorizo was a big let down, and the beef skewers were painfully overcooked (and insanely overpriced)
Also  had the bandeja (nothing special about the pork or the beans, but it was nice to get to eat the guac again) and the pupusa was just ok.

Ordered all 3 of the dessert offerings - all were just ok. The chocolate cake was nice, and the popsicle was fun and refreshing - the rice pudding was a bit of a let down. 

Fun place to get some drinks and food with friends, but not if you're expecting some better than average food."}
{"text":"I recently went to Valdez to meet up with some friends. Our experience was less than desirable but it did not ruin our evening. The prices are higher than I'd like to pay, but that comes with being in your twenties (or growing up in a frugal household). 

The highlights came from the Stuff menu and I'm still craving Pastel almost a week later.

The only thing that left a sour taste in my mouth was the service. Our server listed off the specials with little to no enthusiasm. He also didn't suggest anything from the menu to play off our individual interests (read: alcohol). There were also a few snide remarks and I got the feeling that the wait staff couldn't care less about serving us. What a bummer. Luckily staff turn over is fairly quick in food service so I may be back eventually."}
{"text":"SERVICE
Somewhat slow, 

FOOD
The quality is pretty good. Really loved the Chorizo Sausage and the ceviche.

LOCATION
Convenient on the King Street West, Can head to a bar/lounge after dinner.

Taking off a star because the service could be improved, but overall a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't go here!! Overpriced not authentic Latin food. They just smothered everything in cilantro and guacamole, terrible. There was a piece of glass in our food and the spare ribs were totally burnt. #fail"}
{"text":"Came here one night in the summer with a friend for drinks and sat on the roof top patio - which has a perfect view of the CN Tower.

We ordered a bottle of  champagne followed by some cocktails and a pitcher of the raspberry mojito (SO GOOD). The drinks were awesome, the staff very friendly and both the patio and inside of the restaurant were very cool.

Why am I not giving them the 5th star? I didnt get a chance to taste the food, though it did smell delicious as they have a smoker on the patio. And because you can only smoke on half the patio that doesnt have terrace beams over it and so we had people crowding around our table all night smoking because we werent under the sheltered part."}
{"text":"This place had some crazyyyy good dishes. The Empanadas and Chori Papa are to die for. The place has an awesome atmosphere...it's laid back and trendy at the same time and DAMN! they know what they're doing with their food."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Delicious ceviche, great margaritas and well-trained staff. We went for my husband's birthday and everyone was very happy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"went for a birthday party yesterday, we were a table of 12-14. Ill summarize in point form.

-the ambience and decor was nice. I enjoyed the feel. this is a great drinking with your friends place with some snacks to share.

-the service was good , and our waitress stunningly beautiful , like WOW. 

-the food was unfortunately severely bland for me , and underseasoned. I tasted the empanadas, chaufa . the empanadas looked perfect and texture was great but honestly was very very bland... literally just some salt would have given it some lift. The chaufa was the most espensive fried rice i think ive ever had in my life, and with not much flavour backing it im afraid. Wayy too much Tobiko in it, it kinda ruined the flavour for me. Also the duck in it was a very small amount. it was mostly white rice and edemame with some egg for 22$ .  just a bit over the top considering its their signature dish. its definately not a bad dish, just didnt have any memorable flavours.

-pricing - a little expensive as mentioned. for what it is that is, you can easily make up for such pricing iwht memorable flavorings . unfortunately that was not the case for me. believe me i really wanted to love the food .

All in all a lovely night out, with great service, most people on the table seemed to enjoy their food. Myself i have alot of experience in the kitchen so i guess i expect more when i go out in terms of flavour heh.


all in all a great place to go with friends , think of it as a hispanic izakaya."}
{"text":"The food and service is good and the ambiance and location are great. They also have a nice selection of Mexican beers that I haven't seen at the LCBO."}
{"text":"In search of a good patio today for lunch and came to the roof top of Valdez, which was the perfect spot!  Love the view from here and the food was pretty good too.  My fave were the beef short ribs, but it's only fair you trip the root chips with guac."}
{"text":"My friend and i came here on a friday night with no reservation, we were quickly sat down at the kitchen area which is fun if you like to watch how food is prepared. Our waiter was fun and very helpful.

We ordered guac & chips, margaritas, this pork tossed with potatoes and goat cheese dish( delish!), chicken wings and a taster ceviche. The food was average - good, nothing that blew my mind. What i loved was the atmosphere, we got to chatting with one of the chefs and he even prepared an additional pastry for us. I would come back for the chill atmosphere but not for the food."}
{"text":"Not bad- tasty latino street food with King st. prices
My dining partner loved it-I thought it was aok!"}
{"text":"Food: 7.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10 
Service: 7.5/10
Overall experience: 8/10

My trips to Valdez were a while ago, and when sitting down to write my review, I couldn't come up with much that stood out about my experience. This is potentially a good or a bad thing, depending how you look at it?

I find the food is okay/a bit above average. Part of the reason why it doesn't stand out to me is I think this flavour palette is just not something my taste buds are atuned to. I will say that the chaufa (duck fried rice) is really, really fantastic, but all other things seemed just okay to me. 

Definitely a cool spot in the happening King West area and I can see if you're a few rounds of tequila in, it would be a good time. My more sober dinner experiences were just all right though.

THE BOTTOM LINE: potentially a great place for drinks but if you're coming for the food it'll just be okay."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the service has been good both times.

They have a great selection of items to share, and when I was there with 5 people we ordered one of everything on the \"Stuff\" menu and the flight of ceviche. The tune ceviche is amazing! The rest of the food was great too, especially the guacamole, pastel, and beef skewers.

I love that they have ginger beer on tap! Good to know: The beers on tap come in half-pints, so don't think you're getting a whole pint for the price on the menu!"}
{"text":"What a great experience. 

1. We ordered the fish and chips, muzzarela sticks, calamari, ahi tuna and layer dip to share amongst friends. Everything had good flavour and taste. 

2. Loved the atmosphere. There is a hidden bar in the back which you need a secret code for. Kinda cool but the bouncer didn't even ask us the code just opened the door for us. I kinda wanted to say the code to make it exciting. But it's okay. There was music and a DJ. Some ppl danced while others lounged. 

3. Lots of young professionals and twenty somethings. Great for meeting friends and chilling."}
{"text":"Remember Cheval on King West?
It's no longer a hunting ground for cougars or a playground for bachelorettes.
Well, maybe that is to be determined but at least they can now have Latin American eats thanks to Steve Gonzalez 

Firstly, the space is sexy and fun and there has been a lot of thought put into the decor.  They have fantastic rooftop patio with views of King West.  The patio had lots of standing space and seating, but it will probably be packed once it is discovered.

I would definitely agree that Valdez has potential.

However, the service just plain sucks.
Inattentive, forgetful, and slow.
Suuucks.

Unfortunately, the food also fell short of our expectations..
If you have to ask for hot sauce...
It's just not good.

They boast that they have 5 types of ceviche.
I only had to try the one of them to know that I did't want to try any more.
The mixto was octopus with squid ink.  
It needed more citrus, seasoning, and more seafood.

The chorizo was dry and crumbled while you were eating it.
Not enough fat or flavour.

The fish wrapped in banana leaf was one of the more popular share plates.
The basa fish was a large size.  They will de-bone it for you if you ask.
But you're still going to get fragments while you chew.
They fish was bland....  Moist and fresh, but bland.
The rice had more taste than the fish.
I can't say that I loved the radish salad it was served with.

One of the better dishes of the evening was the pastel.   Crispy on the outside and stuffed with a warm, soft, sweetened cheese mixture.
This was the best thing we had that evening.

As for cocktails, they do have Pisco which I haven't had since traveling in South America.

Their version of a margarita was extra spicy and I liked that the paprika-salted rim.  It was good drink but not cheap.

Valdez, you should be trying harder, especially with Patria so close by..."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for A casual hangout out. The rooftop patio is really nice but the lines without a reservation can get long at times, but depends on when you come. Was here for a few drinks and the usual guac, salsa, tortilla and sweet corn. It's was alright...nothing authentic or special. The drinks were the usual cocktails. 

A nice place to hangout on a lazy afternoon. Wouldn't come back here for food but I do like the patio. So I would give it a 2.5 but apparently we can't give half a on Yelp lol."}
{"text":"Its not a 4 star but the 3 star is for the food! The food was really good but the drinks were not so great.

We had the Michelada Valdez with the tromba but it was just about okay. Maybe the margarita might have been a better choice.

For food we tried the Badeja which was superb, along with a few appetizers (don't remember the names) and it was all very nice.

The decor is very interesting but i found the music to be too loud and found it difficult to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"The server was pretty nice and fast. The food there tasted pretty good except its a bit too salty."}
{"text":"Great food and perfect for sharing with a group of friends. Tapas at its best. Like many yelpers here, I would  also recommend the Chori Papa and Chaufa. 

Service was great. Our waiter was attentive and gave us many recommendations on what to order. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Every bite of food is so full of flavour... Its incredible
We started with the tasting board of ceviche... Enough for 2 to share.
Delicious! Some of them tasted like cocktails, they were all great but i remeber the one with watermelon in was the best.

I love an open kitchen, so nice to see these talented guys working, and its entertainment while you eat.

The chorizo del jefe, the quesadillas, and the beef tortillas were enough for a filling meal for 2 we had one tortilla each.

But honestly, every bite of Valdez's food is full of immense flavour..... Ive been to quite a few high end restaurants but nothing does flavour like Valdez"}
{"text":"we came here for a birthday party and had a prefix menu for the food. I loved the fact that the food came out in tapas style and definitely was very tasty.

the service was on point, they were very accommodating to many dietary restrictions and patient with our big group. 

I've already mentioned the restaurant to a few friends and well be back to check it
out. I've heard great things about their patio so I definitely want to check that out this summer!!"}
{"text":"I recommend the shrimp and albacore tuna ceviches, the duck confit fried rice, and pastels. The Cerveza Tecate came with lime and hot sauce which was a cool twist on beer. 

Nice atmosphere and rooftop patio. Service is average. Price is appropriate to proportion."}
{"text":"expect to be attacked by a cloud of delicious barbeque smoke when you attempt to find happy hour at the upstairs patio in the summer, followed by being told to wait a half hour for a spot for two. then, to top off the tease factor: being told that the happy hour specials menu as listed online (as of August 2014) is no longer available. (..?!)

nevertheless, reservations for a larger group is a good idea even mid-week as this place does get rather busy.

- CHIPS & GUAC - appreciated the variety of chips: potato, plantain, yucca, taro...but just so darn salty
- CHUZOS AL PLANCHA - two beef skewers with chimichurri and mini arepas topping the ends of each. keep in mind the portions if sharing between non-multiples of two. beef was tender but arepas were bland
- CHORI PAPA - crumbled sausage with potatoes, peppers, chipotle mayo and goat cheese. a hearty version of nachos, really enjoyed this.
- CHAUFA - super satisfying fried rice in terms of both flavour and texture -- pop pop crunch from fish roe, shredded duck provided textural contrast, and there was a hint of sweetness throughout. significantly larger portioned vs. all the other dishes
- PUPUSA - thick corn tortillas topped with a variety of veggies. definitely looks prettier than it tastes (i.e. rather bland)
- ATUN JAPONES - ahi ceviche with watermelon. this order came so late that we had already finished eating and wanted to cancel it, except for our curiosity at how the watermelon would work in this ceviche. the consensus? passable. while tuna & watermelon could work well together, the flavours in this dish were like awkward kids at a grade school dance -- no mingling 
- TORMENTA OSCURA - a tart version of a dark & stormy cocktail. i could've done with a little more stormy (ginger beer) and less tart (lime). this watered down really quick for me and was easily forgettable

there are just too many restaurants in the city for me to want to come back here for the hit & miss of everything, but the chori papa and chaufa would definitely be my go-to's if i did."}
{"text":"Had the Family Style price fixe menu. The good: nice ceviche. Nice fried rice with pork and edamame. The bad: our large group of 20 was served \"family style\" but the quantities for certain items left much to be desired. I would expect several bowls of tortilla chips to go with our guacamole, but instead, the very few bowls for our large group were so tiny, they looked like a side for 1 person. When we asked for more chips, our server said \"I recommend against more chips as there is more food coming\". So all the excess guacamole and salsa went untouched as we were out of chips. I would recommend going to Tacos El Asador for their amazing chips and guacamole. Anyway, the Margaritas were good, but loaded down with ice, so they were gone after a few sips. 
The beef skewers were just ok. The chicken fajitas were not good as they were drowning in a very watery sauce. Again, lots of onions and red peppers, and not enough tortillas for the fajitas! I was hesitant to ask for more tortillas after our earlier experience trying to get more chips. For so called Latin Street Food, we were charged a small fortune, plus a non negotiable 18% gratuity. Next time, I'll head to Kensington Market for authentic Latin street food at a decent price."}
{"text":"This review is not for Valdez proper but it's somewhat secret speakeasy hidden bar that can only be described as Escobar. On any given night, after 9:30pm, you can enter the front of valdez and approach the hostess stand and ask \"I'd like to see Escobar\", the hostess will ask you if you know tonight's password, and if you do, you'll be given directions through an alleyway to the location of their hidden speakeasy.

You'll knock on a door, a bouncer opens it, tell him the password and then he opens what appears to be an old freezer door which leads to a small enclosed bar with amazing music and cool decor and lighting.

Cocktails are of top shelf, barchef creation. Creative in ingredients and in presentation, but be forewarned this comes prices that are rapidly becoming known around Toronto as the \"new norm\", $13-15 is an approximate range of what you can come to expect.

Last weekend one of the specials was a cocktail called the Nu-Fash-Un, which was an interesting spin on an old fashioned, using Absinthe and Mescal amongst a series of other ingredients. The other cocktail I had was the Margarita, which was served on the rocks. The margarita itself was pretty good, but the bar tender when a little thick on the salt for my liking.

Overall, a really cool experience, paired with good cocktails and amazing music. I dont know who the Dj was on Saturday night but, WOW, we loved his mixes."}
{"text":"A Friday night dinner walk-in party of four got seated immediately luckily, on their cool second floor. The downstairs featured bar-style tables and stools, with bar seats facing the open concept kitchen to watch the action. The upstairs is a patio-style lounge area with its own bar. The roof is covered but still lets natural light in, and hipster string lightbulbs provide lighting as the sun sets. For a cool ambiance, I definitely recommend asking for seating upstairs.

The menu features Latino tapas, mostly meat items with a few vegetarian options. There's a tasters menu available at a fixed price, and \"mains\" that feature a variety of the tapas presented on one platter-great for sharing among 2-3 people alongside a few extra items. My table ordered the Picada, which had chorizo sausage, wings, a cutlet-like beef item, a fried pork item, empanadas, and another non-meat item or two. All the food items were interesting combinations of different flavours and textures, with simple yet pleasing presentation. 

Drinks come in a decent variety, and for non-alcoholics there's a selection of Latino-style sodas. If you're a fan of cream soda, definitely try the Inca Kola!"}
{"text":"Stopped off on a bit of a whim and sat at their beautiful upstairs patio. The walk up the stairs from inside was poorly lit and fairly dangerous as a result.

We started with 2 caesars and a pitcher of sangria. All were good but the amount of alcohol in the $28 pitcher of sangria was questionable as neither of us could taste / feel much.

We had the chips and salsa/guac, which was pretty basic, nothing to write home about. The chicken wings, which were unbelievably good. The swordfish which was again very good. And the tostadas with smoked chicken, I found the smoked chicken bits to be extremely good but there was far too much guacamole on it as a whole which kind of just took over and turned the dish into a bit of a mess. 

The service was not memorable.

Overall, some hits, some misses, but I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"Was here last night with another couple. This was their second night since opening and they were surprisingly well coordinated and definitely had their act together.  They gave us a quick tour of the place and it has a super cool vibe - South American rustic chic that goes well with their street food inspired menu. There are some \"hot seats\" in front of the open kitchen and it looked like they were having fun cooking up a storm. The place filled up pretty quickly but didn't feel cramped. 

The waitress knew the menu well and made some good recommendations. The cocktails are delish. Loved the Margarica - yummy rim. 
We tried a sampler of the ceviche - so good. The octopus was a favorite. The guacamole and fresh chips (plantain chips included) were super tasty. The chef is definitely not shy of bold flavors. 
For mains we tried:
Pupusa - delish with traditional flavors
Patty melt - good but would have liked the chuck a little more medium rare
Fajita - amazing flavors in the chicken, sofrito was spot on
Trout - FAVORITE, the quinoa was unbelievably flavorful, a huge hit

Dessert - tres leches rice pudding was the only thing that was uderwhelming. 

Bottomline - A great new restaurant in the city. Congratulations Valdez!"}
{"text":"Ok, So its very exciting to be able to review this second

Came here on Monday night with two for a late late bite. The room is interesting, and a welcome change to the late unlamented (in my opinion) Cheval. 

-Started with a Rum Cocktail that was decent. 
-The beers are decently priced
-I tried a bit of my friend's vegan Cerviche, didn't really see the point without the Tuna.
-We ordered the guacamole to share, it was amazing, the high point being the plantain and yucca chips and the really nice texture and flavour of the guacomole.
-I ordered the empenadas, they were nice and quite flavourful but not as good as the guacomole.
-The high point for me and the reasons this place is getitng four stars is the Chifa that I ordered. Made with duck confit, fried rice and some other stuff, it is a Peruvian take on Chinese food. It was awesome. The fried rice alone was the best i've ever had. I'd never heard of the dish before but it was a great blend of Latin and Asian flavours.
-One friend had the Trout, didn't get a chance to try it because he demolished it all.
-Our other companion had the Fajitas. I had a bit of one. They were quite nice and the chicken was very tender and may have been sous-viende. Wasn't as amazing as mine though.
-We ordered the docle de Lecha and some rice balls for savoury and sweat at the end of the meal. They were okay. but the Dolce de Lecha was a bit strange (don't eat all the caramel)

Overall, I would come here for Guac, beers and the Chifa!!! Worth a try for sure"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my night here on the rooftop patio! It is great for a warm night catching up with a close friend or with an so. It can get loud though cuz apparently Sundays are the new Fridays and the dj goes all out. Nice mix though so I was into it .Note that that they ARE open on Sundays only not full resto just tapas and barbecue option which is good in my book and enjoyed. I liked there beers on tap, glasses are small, but they offer a cocktail special for a litres worth for a fair price which it has they say bout 6 oz so it's a deal. Food was quite good I liked it! Small portions  so definitely eat before you come here because it's more of a tapas place. Service was very friendly, and relatively fast. For a pretty busy night it was a fair pace in my book!  I will return to try more of their tapas. I really enjoyed the ribs they had nice flavour!"}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere and amazing food.  Great service as well.  Definitely get the fish tacos (goes by a different name) and I would recommend the patio."}
{"text":"I came to Valdez with a bunch of friends last weekend and we had a really good time.  The food was great and the atmosphere was fun and inviting.  We had an amazing waiter who was super friendly and helpful.  I enjoyed the ceviche (the bite size is just that! It's literally two bites and a little overpriced).  The good news is the ceviche is authentic.  I have been looking for a restaurant with authentic ceviche for quite some time in Toronto and Valdez does a great job at that.

The next dish I had was beans, rice and pork since I wasn't too hungry.  It was okay but it didn't really impress me much and it seemed like it was missing something.  It definitely could have had more flavour.

Allover, the experience was nice and I would go back to order a full portion of the ceviche.

Later in the evening the restaurant turns into a lounge and I thought that was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've never had food there but I'm actually very much looking forward to that. Have been to the rooftop patio bar a few times and had an amazing time every single time. I hosted my birthday there as well and the staff were more than friendly and the manager helped me a lot in figuring out when and where to have the party. The rooftop is covered during the cold months so still an ideal place to have a group of friends."}
{"text":"Most of the food is decent but the only memorable dish is the dirty duck fried rice"}
{"text":"The duck rice thing is beyond amazing, it's the stuff wet dreams are made of! 

I'm also a huge fan of their fajitas note you will have to order a side of guac to truly enjoy these puppies and the guac is small and that's a downer being that you can never have enough guacamole!

Another important note on chicken fajitas: they tend to leave / include the tendons, knuckles, and fat, so if you are like me and that stuff grosses you out, you are going to have to put in some extra work and clean it up before you eat which sux because I love to just dig in.... 

Not a big fan of their ceviche it's not traditional and I love true ceviche. 



Overall I really like this place"}
{"text":"We ordered The 'Flight'. Ceviche sampler of albacore tuna, scallop, ahi tuna, BC rockfish, and a cold smoked chicken causa. Very tasty and got a good sample of each. Also go the duck confit fried rice which was a HUGE portion! Again, tasty. Not a 5/5 as nothing really blew my mind but a solid place for dinner if ure in the area!! Big plus - sit at the kitchen bar to watch the chefs cook!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is on a \"happening\" street so it's a great place to have dinner and drinks before hitting up a club or lounge. Food and atmosphere is very casual. It was tapas style so my friends and I got a bunch of plates to share. Between 5-7pm daily is their happy hour so you can choose between a red and
white wine for $6/glass or some cocktails for around $9. There's some small tapas dishes on the happy hour menu ranging from about $3-$8. We got the fried chicken wings (3 wings for $4) that came on a bed of bbq sauce. Popcorn was a small sample size bag flavoured with like a dry paprika and tajin seasoning (nothing special but good as just a light snack to munch on if you're early and waiting for the rest of your party to arrive). We also had their fried plantain topped with guac and Frijoles (bowl of rice with beans, a fried egg, guac, pork belly, etc. That was OK but not epic and unique so I wont order that again. Of the mains we got, my two favourite were the Chaufa and the Chori Papa. Chaufa was more of an Asian dish...fried rice on a sizzling plate. I really liked how crispy the rice was coupled with fish eggs mixed into it. The duck confit was a thin slice of duck that was also very crispy and delicious. 
The Chori Papa was like a patatas bravas ...chipotle mayo, goat cheese and pork on top of diced potatoes that went really well with the soft tortilla wraps that it came with. Dessert menu - nothing caught my eye so I opted for no dessert."}
{"text":"I never thought I could try good ceviche in Canada, however, Valdez's ceviche changed my mind. I tried the \"tipico\" ceviche and loved it. I'll definitely go back for their ceviche sampler. 

I went on Monday and had their fajita special and their beef was so tender; each bite was a delight. Their chorizo and arepita appetizer was a burst of flavor in each bite. They have a happy hour of $3.50 beer and cheap appetizers. Even though it's on the pretentious King section, this restaurant does not have that feel. It's a great place for a date. I can't wait to go back and try their Pisco Sours!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!  We ordered a variety of the ceviche which all tasted so fresh and amazing. I loved the cilantro flavour and it didn't overpower the other ingredients.  The croquetas and empanadas were also very good.  It's sort of on the pricey side but it's quite a trendy place.  We ordered a few cocktails which were all great!  I'm looking forward to returning in the summer and going on the rooftop patio I've heard so many positive things about!

The service was really good and staff are very knowledgeable about the menu items.  The place is quite loud so it's hard to maintain a conversation without speaking quite loudly but the atmosphere is fun.  Definitely a great option on King West!"}
{"text":"Great spot especially for tasting an assortment of small latin inspired plates. 

First time I went I sat at the kitchen bar and watched the chefs put together all different plates. They were good company and they let me try a few delicious treats.

Second time I went was a good way to start off the night, with decent cocktails and unique plates. 

Loud venue but still good for bigger groups.

Menu is sorted into ceviches (~$5 tasters/~$15 full size, \"stuff\" (to taste/share, $7-12), and mains ($20s). 

The chips & salsa & guac \"stuff\" is a must to start!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sat night at 6:30pm, had reservations for 10 people which they were happy to accommodate. We had the most amazing servers Sergio and Alex! They were attentive and observant throughout the night. We had one of each cerviche, the Mixto was a bit sour, and not as popular with the group. Sergio was extremely knowledge about the dishes and described each one in details as they came. Unless you're familiar with these dishes, you need to rely on the server to translate what in the dish. The place was quiet when we came, but got pretty busy as the night wore on. There is a coat rack in front, sort of monitored by the staff behind the retail counter. They sell some unique items like coffee and hot sauce. We didn't get to stay for the lounge/club upstairs, no cover to get in. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not my type. Service was good, except that the desert took literally over an hour to get to the table. Margaritas were good, genuine Latino style! However I wasn't too impressed when I bit into my fajita and got a full mouth - full of chicken fat & cartilidge. Also I thought the cornmeal empinatas were very bland. 

Would maybe return, but only for drinks. Food wasn't bad, just not for my personal palette."}
{"text":"Sadly this place was a let down, fajitas that could be made anywhere and have had better at a basic steak house. Let me start with the drinks, while they have a pretty good drink menu your beer comes in a tiny glass making it less appealing to order another while the pour on wine is not much any better. We were a party of 10 and found the service to be shocking on Tuesday night while we were there. My friends drink took forever to get to him and then they brought the same guys food to him after we all finished eating with a 25% discount on his bill only after we asked for it, (pretty pathetic) They also charged us extra for chips and salsa which should always be complimentary at these types of restaurants, upon getting our bill we found a 18% gratuity which was automatic, the service we received was no better than at 10% tip. 

Back to food; Food was bland for a South American Latino style place, no hot sauce and chincy portions.   This place is as pretentious as King West gets, sadly I cannot see it lasting long especially with the portion of beer I received, this is Toronto we do Pints here not water glasses!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Everything I tried was absolutely tasty except for the beans, although I don't like black beans, which might make that judgement irrelevant.

The service was good, and I had the opportunity to be seated right in front of the kitchen (it's an open concept restaurant) and see how everything is made, as well as having a very detailed description, of some of the dishes I ordered, by the only girl in the kitchen. She was really nice with us.

All in all, go and give it a try. It's worth going and at least have an empanada or my favourite so far; the chuzo with arepa.

Prices are ok. The appetisers/entrées/sides named \"stuff\" by the owner, are between 6 and 9 dollars, and the main courses between 12 and 25.
By the way, they've got a wonderful rooftop patio."}

Valdez joins the list of Top Chef Canada alumni such as Trista Sheen and Carl Heinrich to open up a bricks and mortar location to showcase the stuff that TV is made of.  The former Origin chef de cuisine debuted at many popup events under the brand Bushwick serving up refreshing ceviches prior to opening up shop in the trendy neighbourhood of King West.

The restaurant entrance is furnished with coffee bean burlap sacks and cigar-rolling station and opens up into a long space, with the open kitchen serving as the focal point.  The bar shelving features pointed arches that look as if they've been pulled from a church with booth seats and tables extending towards the back.

Service can be a hit-and-miss but errs towards the side of slow.  Lunch service, which should be quick and speedy turns into an hour and a half long endeavour, whereby diners select from a grid of Valdez favourites - 3 for $15 or 4 for $19.  At first glance there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or rhythm to the menu especially since desserts share the same column as the soup of the day, but then again sweets aren't for everyone.  Our server tells us that the \"bento box\" concept is soon being swapped out for a regular menu which should help hasten service.

The loud music makes it hard to not hurl comments across the table without sounding like an angry person; and it is only after 3 attempts at getting the staff to turn it down that we return to civilization.

The Ceviche Sampler was a no-brainer given that Gonzalez won the 86'd Ceviche Smackdown; though not for sharing unless you're willing to swap spit with your fellow dinner compadres. While light and refreshing, the flavors were rather muted and nothing particularly stood out.

The Chorizo del Jefe, is tender but too grainy for my liking though the mini arepitas are chewy and delicious.

The saving grace is definitely in their flavor-chalked bowl of Chaufa, a dish inspired by the Chinese population of Peru featuring duck confit, edamame, duck egg and Tobiko.  I could definitely have 2-3 helpings of this dynamite bowl.

Finish off your meal with another rice-ful in the form of Tres Leche Pudding, in essence a rice pudding with coconut, whole milk, mango and caramelized banana - it is divine.

There aren't many Latin American choices in the King West locale; so if that's what you're craving then Valdez will answer the call.  But I think I'd rather walk a bit further to Kensington Market for my fix."}
{"text":"Decent. The food was hit or miss - not as good as Playa Cabana. I feel like it's a tad overhyped and the atmosphere makes it out to be a lot greater than it actually is but regardless it's worth trying. 

It's good for sharing plates. I would recommend the choufa, the scallop ceviche, empanadas and the chips and guac."}
{"text":"Entertaining place on the weekends - enjoyed the DJ. However, it's tricky to obtain a table that won't disappear by 11pm. Thankfully we were able to get a great spot to sit and have drinks but because of the craziness the service was extremely slow. However, I'd still like to come back to try the food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if there is a Mexican restaurant ... I'm in all the way. I went with a friend on a busy Saturday night and even though we had reservations for the actual restaurant (downstairs) we opted to sit in the upstairs patio area. It is a beautiful space, that is lively with amazing music. We were seated and waited a lonnnnng time for the server. The server was friendly but seemed frazzled. The patio has a very limited menu, so my friend and I ordered an assortment of food.
When the food came after a crazy long wait for the simple appetizer food we ordered... We were disappointed to say the least. The food was horrendous!!! 
I could have done a better job cooking/preparing it and I don't cook. It was especially insulting because the food was crazy expensive for what it was & served on styrofoam plates to top it off!!! 
I gave the place 2 stars because the patio is beautiful & fun .. I would definitely go back.. but never on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Valdez boasts of its Latin inspired flavours and twists, which all sound great on paper but massively disappoint where it truly matters, taste.

I've dined here twice now. Both times, I've really enjoyed the vibe and ample space the restaurant has to offer. An inefficient layout to say the least, but if it works for them, I'm happy as a customer to be able to peer down their high ceiling, wooden floored, endless bar and kitchen. The atmosphere is sexy, I feel good sitting anywhere here but the bench style, high seating sure doesn't kill my vibe. Definitely a King Street appropriate space.

The problem with Valdez comes in their food. On my first visit, I tried the flank steak and whole fish (branzino). Both dishes were disappointing and lacked finesse, flavor, and seasoning. The 'steak' was more of a salad with strips of steak on top, I'd appreciate it if the menu advertised this dish as such, I wouldn't have order it if I knew my craving for red meat would be compromised for greens. The whole fish sounded great too, perhaps the signature dish, a showstopper, but once again the presentation was bested by the lack of fundamental, elementary seasoning of every component on the plate. From salad, to fish, the whole dish was bland with only the sour vineragrette from the salad as flavouring. It's seasoning/cooking 101 forgotten and lost here.

Fast forward 2 months, I dine here again and I check in through Yelp, I'm the Duke- I should have took this as fair warning, no one comes a second time apparently. I had faith and below average expectations, yet somehow even those expectations were a tad high still. Like the last time, the service was great- very friendly and knowledgable with the menu. No problems for me in that regard. I ordered 2 ceviche dishes, the chaufa, and the special of the day which was halibut with shrimp with a side of greens and fennel. 

The ceviches were quite good, a tad small but manageable for the $4 and $5 price. Following the ceviche was the chaufa with duck confit, tabiko, edamame, chili, egg. Basically a glorified fried rice that's more sweet that salty, spicy, and robust in flavor. For $19, a bit of a stretch considering it's just fried rice but tasty.
 
What really grinded my gears was the special dish of the night. I spent almost all dinner discussing about this dish and how mad I was at it. Halibut was dry, the salad was under seasoned and just felt like (because it tasted like) I was eating a plate of garnish. You know, a small piece of greenery to add color, but just more of it to make a forest of garnish. The only saving grace for that dish was the sauce, the cocount came through nicely but not even a gallon of that could save the shrimp under it all. They were unshelled shrimp which fell apart upon stabbing, ended with a mushy texture normally associated with spoiled, unfresh, shrimp or super super super over cooked shrimp. Over cooked shrimp is rubbery, tough - this was mushy, gritty shrimp. I was baffled. Why in high heavens would this 'dish' cost $21 when it's really a plate full of garnish, dry fish and mushy shrimp?

Oh right, it must be King Street my friends, must be King Street. Seems to be the excuse. 

I know Valdez ain't going to take any advice from a Yelper, but if anything, for the reader's sake, understand these key and important things: 
1. Your food is going to be under seasoned and inconsistently seasoned
2. Latino street food means Asian fusion sometimes because you know, there are Asians everywhere.
3. The patio and drinks can be good- I haven't gone for just a drink, so that may be a great experience."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, service was good, and vibe of the restaurant was spot on. I would probably come back here every so often if I was actually a local. 

Chaufa was really good. The tobiko gave it a mild seafood flavor."}
{"text":"Walking into Valdez is automatically relaxing and the food is so, so good. I cannot believe this place only has a 3.5-star rating average. Lived for a decade in New York so I have a spoiled palate and this place delivers...

Everything is fresh and ripe from the ceviche (El Tipico) to the empanadas to the chaufa. I am gluten intolerant but risked the pain to try the chaufa (which has soy) and it was well-worth it. Also, the empanadas are delicious. Since going gluten-free a year ago I haven't experienced the chewiness offered by their GF empanadas.

The cocktails are insanely good too, especially the El Pepino. This drink seemed to balance out the effects of the alcohol, alkaline with basil, lemon, chili-lime syrup and cucumber like a green juice.

Our server was sweet and accommodating; the cooks seemed relaxed in the open kitchen. I will definitely be going back and highly recommend this place for a chill dining experience."}
{"text":"We went here with a group of 6 people. The food was very good with the exception of the chorizo. I still haven't had a good authentic chorizo meal in Toronto. I found the drink menu to be very limited. But the staff and the music was great. I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my cousins. Great Mexican/Latino fusion food. As someone who lives in CA, I have high standards, but the food definitely met these standards. Recommended."}
{"text":"Solid 4/5 for Valdez 

We got the Tiradito and Mixto ceviche and chips and guac for food. For drinks we tried the Tormenta Oscura and Palomero. 

I really enjoyed the Tiradito ceviche. Large pieces of albacore tuna, fish roe, and chunks of guac. TIP: Order the full size if you are hungry, as the smaller portion will not be filling. 

Mixto was a mix of octopus, calamari, mussels, and sweet potato with squid ink. This dish was pretty mediocre, we didn't taste the mussel and the flavour was very light for a ceviche. 

I do enjoy the chips and guac here, the chips include a mix plantain, yucca, taro, potato, which is a nice change from the traditional nachos. However only thing is some of the chips tasted a bit stale. 

Staff is very friendly from the bartenders, greeter, and waiter. Waiter consistently came to check up on us. However, what I enjoy most about Valdez is the atmosphere, it was bustling on Friday night and luckily we came right when the patio opened."}
{"text":"The interior is very nice so walking in I expected a great experience only to find out like many reviews here the service is lacking. The food is O.k but not great. The issue is there are much better places to dine within 20 ft of this place for the same money"}
{"text":"Update: About a week after posting this, I was refunded the full $60. 
--
TL;DR I'm owed about $40-45 from Valdez from them overcharging a tab I accidentally kept open one night. The General Manager has continually put off my emails and not returned my calls. It's been two months and this still has not been resolved. 
--
I've dealt with bad customer service before but this place, by far, trumps it all. 

In early May, my friends and I went here for a few drinks. Atmosphere was great and place was bumping. The rooftop patio was killer and the servers were quite nice. The compliments end there. 

I ordered what was dubbed their version of a dark n stormy. Perhaps it was a one-off but it tasted nothing like it to me - more like a sour, if anything. 

I opened up a tab at the bar thinking I'd get a second drink later on but, after a buddy got us a round of drinks later, we decided to head to a club. In our haste, I forgot to collect my CC and, from there, the issues began. 

The next day, I called and was told a manager would be free around 5pm to give me my card. I showed up at 5pm only to wait around for about 15 minutes for another manager to come and tell me that the manager with the key to the safe (in which my credit card was) actually wasn't there and that he'd be in around 6pm. Wish they had let me know sooner that I didn't have to come by 5 but whatever - didn't make a big deal of it. 

When I went back later, again, I waited around for a good 15 minutes before a manager came to me with my CC. My card had been charged for my drink and an 18% gratuity. I understand they need to cash out at the end of the night and I screwed up by not closing out so no complaints here. I asked for a receipt just to ensure I wasn't overcharged. The manager told me he didn't have a copy and that he didn't have time to print me one at that time. If there were any issues on my CC statement, he said to call. 

A week later, I checked my statement and, surely, there was a discrepancy. I had been charged an amount of $30 twice, totalling $60. And remember, I had just ONE drink. 

I called the restaurant and the hostess said the General Manager was unavailable. She said she would get the GM to call me back. I got her name and thanked her.

No call for a week. I called back and got the same hostess. Same thing - she said the GM was unavailable and that she'd get him to call me back. 

No call for another few days. I called back - same hostess, same result. I expressed my frustration and that I needed this resolved. This hostess seemed to have no remorse or appreciation for my situation. 

No call again. I called back the next day and got another hostess. I explained to her my situation. She sounded much more sympathetic, at least. She tried to get the GM on the phone but he was in a meeting. I expressed the need for him to call me and she assured me that she would do everything she could. 

Kudos to this hostess as the GM ended up calling me that day. When I picked up, there was no small talk or apology for the back and forth that had been going on for weeks. He immediately asked for me to email with the CC statement and details of what I bought that night. 

As soon as I hung up, I sent an email with details - that was May 28. Two follow up emails from me and another phone call later, he finally responded on June 5 asking for my CC number this time so he could reverse one of the payments. I responded back asking him to clarify what he was charging me. 

No answer. I went on vacation and revived the thread on June 22. No answer again. On June 26, I sent a more aggressive email saying I was getting fed up and that I had no intention of recommending his restaurant to my friends. I received an email the very next day with the excuse of it being busy because of the World Cup and that he was charging me $30 for ONE drink. I responded back immediately stating how absurd it was that the one drink was that expensive and for him to give me the exact price of the exact drink I got. It's been another 3 days and I haven't heard anything. 

At this point, I'm absolutely flabbergasted at how utterly disrespectful the GM (and the first hostess) have been to me. I realize I made a mistake in leaving my tab open but I can't imagine it's rare. That does not give you the right to ignore me and put off correcting a transactional mistake (with what seems to be the hopes of me just letting this pass). 

I normally give places a few visits before I write them off or take to social media to vent but it doesn't matter to me anymore that I'm owed what's likely to be $40-45 or if the value was even $5. Out of principle, I want my money back and I'm telling people about this. The fact that I've been treated like this for nearly two months is indicative of how this establishment views their patrons. I wouldn't wish this frustration on anyone and highly recommend anyone reading this to avoid having to deal with such a nightmare of an ordeal."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Latin street food
Menu Items: Chips, guacamole & salsa, Japanese Tuna Ceviche, Empanadas, Flank Steak with Arepitas & Choripapa, Aguardiente and Helado de Salpicon

Fellow compadre, owner and former Top Chef Canada contestant, Steven Gonzalez (El Jefe), has successfully created with Valdez a restaurant culture that mixes traditional Latin dishes with down-to-earth street food. It's a party on a plate that respectfully represents our ancestors' roots while evolving tastes and ingredients for the average Latin street food lover, like me.

For those of you familiar with Colombian culture, Valdez is the name of our famous Colombian coffee brand and in the case of Chef Gonzalez' post, it means a lot more than that. Valdez is his uncle's last name, the man who inspired this wonderful Jefe to become the man that he is today - a classical French-trained chef and a true Colombian at heart.

Just last week I visited Valdez for the first time. Invited by the folks at Zomato Toronto, the recently launched innovative foodie app, a handful of foodies and yours truly, found ourselves indulging on succulent Latin dishes that left us longing for more.

Chef Gonzalez, in partnership with the folks at Zomato, decided to open our appetites with a glass of cava and a terrific shot of Japanese Tuna ceviche.
Marinated in a mixture of lime, ponzu and chiles, this ceviche came paired by watermelon, pickled ginger, radishes and pear. The tuna was fresh, tender and tasted like the ocean.

Next up, we were seduced with a selection of plantain, yuca (cassava) and corn chips with salsa, guacamole and popcorn. All fantastic nibbles and bites to washed off the strong ceviche taste and started us off with our delectable meal.

Latino street food really speaks to all of the unique dishes one can find in Latin American streets. Empanadas, a Colombian cornbread staple, are corn patties that are typically stuffed with potatoes and minced beef. In the case of Valdez, the apple did not fall far from the tree, or in this case, the empanada. The version of this street staple at Valdez included beef, potatoes, Chef Gonzalez' famous Latino 5 spice and topped off with a home-made Aji (a spicy sauce that often contains tomatoes, cilantro (coriander), habanero pepper, onions and water).

As part of the special menu for the Zomato Toronto foodies, el Jefe served us a tender flank steak drizzled with red chilies and accompanied by some more steak on skewers, chimichurri sauce, arepitas (white corn meal and cheese) and rice and beans. This was mixture of Argentinian and Colombian favourites all served in one plate, with a nice spicy kick to it. The rice and beans were a hit as it was the steak, but the arepitas were the winner, just like when Colombia scored 5-0 to Argentina in 1993!

Another hit from the El Jefe was the Choripapa, a bowl full of spiced pork, potatoes, peppers and goat cheese drizzled with chipotle mayo. It was silky, spicy, chewy, crunchy and creamy all at once.

And if good food was not enough, the Chef decided to help us digest the night off with a night cap of Aguardiente (a Colombian alcoholic drink derived from sugarcane and flavored with anise) and a delicious ice popsicle made of salpicon (aka fruit punch).

A big thanks to El Jefe and Zomato for a wonderful meal, great night and good company!

Buen Provecho,
Foodies Inked."}
{"text":"a bad experience; a waitress tried to rip us off, just I know I am not coming back again"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Valdaz - service was amazing, food was amazing and the atmosphere was amazing.  I would highly recommend it.  Also, I didn't find it pricey - pretty normal for Toronto.  Of the dishes we tried, the Ahi Tuna civeche was my favorite."}
{"text":"I Love Valdez!  The cocktails, food and atmosphere are amazing. You don't need to go from one place to another.  It is definitely my one stop shop and I always recommend this restaurant/bar to anybody. In the summer,  the rooftop patio has a beautiful view of the CN tower. The vibe is so chill.  They have a DJ Thurs,  Fri &  sat nights and play the best music. Top 40, hip hop,  r&b,  reggae. Bartenders are fast, efficient and friendly. Their signature cocktails are delicious and probably the only place in Toronto where you can get proper Capirinha.  The food is absolutely delicious. I suggest trying the 3 or 4 course menu. You will not be disappointed.  I work in a hotel and I always recommend Valdez for a nice night out."}
{"text":"To be updated...

Went on a Saturday with two friends and although I had no real expectations (had never heard of it before), it was still an amazing experience.

First and foremost, I suggest you sit downstairs at the chef's table. We were trying to wait for a table and only being offered upstairs BBQ only sitting and menu. We wanted full menu and finally the hostess offered us chef's table - great decision. We got to talk to the guys as they worked their food magic and see all their dishes being produced. 

Ambiance - surprisingly casual, I didn't feel uncomfortable in my jeans and blouse, and folks were dressed in a variety of styles. The best part of my ambiance (besides my dinner companions) was the enjoyment and professionalism of the chefs.

Bang for the Buck - yes

Am I going back - can't afford this weekly, but would take out of town guests there or  go an occasion."}
{"text":"Nothing special, even the duck rice others raved about would be put to shame by the average Hakka joint and at half the price.
I don't need secret bars or busy patios, just good food and service, neither of which were found here. It was so bad I was forced to write my first review, I have no idea why others like this place?"}
{"text":"Valdez has been on my must go to restaurant list for a long time and unfortunately I found it underwhelming. The atmosphere was amazing, had a great latin feel and the patio looked nice but there is a first come first serve bases. the restaurant was busy so we felt the service was rushed and wasn't the friendliest I've had in Toronto. I had made a simple request to ask if the fried egg with out dish could be put on the side due to a dietary restriction at our table but the server said the kitchen wouldn't do so and if they did it would cause a back log in the kitchen (really? The power of one egg can back log a kitchen? ok sure.)

When the food came, it wasn't the greatest I've had. Not to stay it was horrible but I didn't believe it was worth what the restaurant was asking for. The Scallop Ceviche was good but small for a full portion, the brisket hash was under seasoned and the Picada which sounded great was disappointing. The beef was tough, the wings did not have alot of favour but the home made chorizo sausage saved the dish. However, the best dish of the night was the Caufa sin carne, a fried rice with eggs, mushroom, tofu and edamame bursting with flavor.

Overall, if you're looking for a place to hang out and grab a drink this is place has a great atmosphere. But if you're here to eat and have a long wait, I'd suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's my second time here to Valdez and though they've been brief for pre-parties, this place has YET to have disappointed me. Right at Portland and King st W, Valdez is central to all the nice bars and boutiques along this stretch of road.  Its got an extensive restaurant, with an open concept kitchen, and if you feel like dancing, there's a flight of stairs to the left after entering their coach check area at the front. During the summer nights, its definitely a hot spot for drinks and after a certain time, tables and chairs are moved aside to create a bigger dancefloor for those salsa-merengue oficionados!  
They've got a range of Latin infused cocktail and plenty of food and drink options.  For those who are not sure, they've also got a fixed menu that are posted on the website.  One things for sure, I will be coming back here once summer arrives!"}
{"text":"Before I get to the food, One of the best margaritas ive ever had and I live in Southern California. I tried the Rose at first but it wasnt that good so I stuck with Margaritas. 

We were in a big group so I tried a variety of different tapas along with my drinks.

I Loved all the Tapas and im very picky when it comes to that, I drove my friend crazy in spain going around looking for the best Tapas Places.

My favorites that everyone should try:

Scallop Ceviche (bay scallops cocktel, steamed corn with paprica and lemon cream (mazorca), chorizo and potatoes (chori papa), smoked chicken guac (La reina) and the empanadas.

\"The Big ass steak\" looked amazing, but I didnt get a chance to try it. Its a 32oz bone in rib ey with chimichurri sauce and its for 2 people. 

All around great experience."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times the servers and food have been awesome. Consistent quality. Also loving the atmosphere. The place is clean and chill."}
{"text":"It is a good place to eat authentic Mexican street food in Toronto. A pit on the pricey side, but the food and the atmosphere make up for it. Service was excellent. You can see the chefs cooking the food in front of you, which is always nice. Of course I tried Chori Papa and my friend had a whole fried fish. Both dishes were delicious. I am eager to return to this place."}
{"text":"Very authentic and service was awesome! My boyfriend and I celebrated his birthday there and ordered the 3 course set menu for $39pp. We were sooo full by the end with the drinks we ordered!
First course: ceviche 2 ways
Second course: Meat platter and rice w/beans and avocado
Third course: Tres leche and coconut ice cream

Check in for a free margarita!

If we came during warmer weather, we would be up on the rooftop patio."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check Valdez out ever since Steve Gonzalez left Origin to open it up. The fact that they were showing the World Cup finals provided the perfect opportunity to watch the game and enjoy some great food and drinks while doing it.

It's a huge space for the area, and was packed on this particular occasion. My party and I were seated on the patio, which was spacious with great exposure (no tall surounding buildings covering it in shade).

Everything that we ordered was great. Guac, salsa and chips, great. Quail was cooked to perfection and tasty. chorizo on a bun, Bay scallops cocktel, chicken wings, were all good. the best thing we ordered though was the Chaufa - Fried rice. whooo, this fried rice went beyond any of my expectations. It had tons of flavour, and had that bit of a kick from the peppers that made me salivate with every spoonful. It's definitely the dish to get if you go here.

For the drinks I got the Mojito, which was more of a hard pink lemonade, and the Dark and Stormy. The mojito was good, but if you're looking for a traditional mojito, this probably isn't for you. The Dark and Stormy on the other hand was what you'd expect from it and very enjoyable on a nice hot day.

All in all, I was happy with my expererience, and will definitely be back. Expecially when I'm craving some fried rice."}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Very unique cuisine with Columbian influences. Guac and chips (plantains), scallop ceviche and Choufa (duck confit/rice dish) are all off the chain. Drink the champagne cocktail with hibiscus flower. Staff was super friendly. Sat at the bar."}
{"text":"Entertaining family from out of town and wanted to show off Toronto so decided King West was the place to go. Valdez was the perfect place to go. The food was delicious (the Quesadillas and Chori Papa was ah-mazing!), the atmosphere was great, and the service was excellent. I would definitely go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had a little issue here and it wasn't the restaurants fault, but the way they handled was not 'customer first'"}
{"text":"We came here because our friends were raving about it. Overall, we weren't really that impressed. Nothing we had was out of this world. I think it's over priced. What you're paying for his the experience and the ambiance. The best thing about this place was the washrooms. The drinks were decent too. My boyfriend enjoyed his Cuba Libre Sour. The Bay scallops cocktel was OK, again nothing that was so mouth watering you're craving later. Mixto was nothing to write home about. My boyfriend liked the Chuzos al plancha. Our bill was pretty pricey for nothing that spectacular. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Latino street party any day of the night, why the heck not?!

Came here for a birthday. You can make reservations quick and easy on their website. When we got there, we wanted to check out the patio to see if we should eat there, but it was super cold so we dined in the main dinner area at the far end of the restaurant instead. The place was packed. It's a very casual atmosphere. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. She recommended that we try the \"street party\" 3 course meal for $45 per person. We were feeling lazy to order our own stuff and decided to give this a try since it had a bit of everything. This was the chef's pick so everything was a surprise! I did, however asked if we could get ceviche for one of the dishes since this was their signature dish. The waitress said she would look into this, which was great, because we did get a small dish of ceviche each!

First course:
Chips & Guac & Salsa plantain + yucca + taro + corn chips + potato + guacamole + tomato - My second fave dish. loved the gauc and the different chips that it came with.

Atún Japonés ahí tuna + watermelon + radish + ponzu  - Nice and light, but not a lot of taste

Bay scallops cocktail - Very nice and light

Second course:
Empanadas - Didn't like this because it was very bready 

Beef skewers - This was dry. I would skip this dish

Tortillas with chicken, veggies, and potatoes - Very saucy. It was good, but very greasy. The tortillas wraps were a bit dry, but we toasted it the next day and it tasted good

Fried Chicken Wings guava BBQ sauce - This was awesome! My fave thing!

Short ribs in a variety of sauces - My boyfriend really liked this. It was tender, but I didn't like the sauce

Third course:
A frozen popsicle - Refreshing

Rice pudding - Really liked this!

We also order a pitcher of mo-tio (mojito) and sangria. They were okay. I found it a bit watered down. Nothing really compared to the free margarita that we had as a result of checking in on the yelp app. It was super strong!

We were all super full from the dinner and had to get take away. We ate the food the next day and it tasted good, with the exception of the empanadas. The food is pretty greasy though. I'm not sure if it was worth $45 a person as I think you can order individual dishes and get more variety. However, this was easily two meals because we took a lot of leftovers home. I say get this if you are lazy and want to try a little bit of everything on the menu. 

We went back up to the patio after dinner and it was beautiful because it was overlooking the CN tower. It's a small patio, but I'm sure it's a good scene during the summer. We were there last week, but it was still cold.

The service was really good here and I loved the freebie drink. The food wasn't bad, but there's definitely room for improvements. I see a lot of potential with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had such high hopes for this trendy Latin joint on King...unfortunately the food last Friday fell way short of the mark. We ordered the chips/guac/salsa app to start (the chips were honestly the best part) followed by fried halibut with yucca--more like yuck-ah! Seriously, did I just eat a pasty, foul-flavoured potato? And then we tried the chicken tortillas with plantains.

I didn't really enjoy anything I tasted here. Sorry Valdez! Maybe I just don't like \"Latin street food\"? 

On the plus side, service was great and cocktails were awesome."}
{"text":"Good food with an authentic feel. A bit pricey for the positions and gets really busy Thurs-Sat nights, so booking a res is recommended. But overall a good Mexican place downtown"}
{"text":"They recommend their ceviche which is alright, but the chorizo sausage is amazing. It was thick and had a very \"homemade\" taste to it. The arepas also might be the best in the city. I had to special order them twice.

For dessert the caramelized bananas on the tres leches pudding were incredible. I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night with another couple.  We hadn't made a reservation in advance, but showed up shortly before 7:00PM when the upper floor opened.  (If you haven't made a reservation, definitely get there shortly before 7PM, at least on a Saturday, as the place fills up fast!)

Both my friend and I are pregnant, and really appreciated how understanding and accommodating our server was regarding all of our dietary restrictions.  We opted for food from the \"Stuff\" portion of the dinner menu, and also appreciated the fact that the server was very realistic about how many plates would be enough and how many would be too many.

The food was FANTASTIC.  Among some other items, we had chips & guac and salsa, empanadas, muzzarela sticks (holy good!) verdes, and the carne asada.  Not a single item was \"so-so\", everything was excellent.

Except that we as couples each have kids on the way meaning that our trendy restaurant days are probably over for a while, we would all definitely go back.  Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"The most unique and authentic Latin food in the city!!! Wow the duck confit rice!!! Everything was so delicious including the cocktails. The staff were knowledgable and friendly. I heard there is some sort of private tequila bar located through a fridge door or something. Crazy!! I hope I get invited back next time I go. 5 stars!!! A must try."}
{"text":"Wow!  My husband and I absolutely loved Valdez.  Loved it!  The food, drink, service, and atmosphere are fantastic.  If we lived closer to Toronto (we are from Boston), we would be eating here all the time!

Valdez serves Latin American street food, including fried empanadas, squid ink ceviche, and a milky dessert made with dulce de leche.  The restaurant itself is casual and fun.  The corridor space has two larger bars and elm-topped tables painted in flashy reds, yellows, and blues to warm-up concrete floors and grey steel fixtures.  The kitchen is also open so you can enjoy watching the chefs cook your food.

We started off our meal with a watermelon craft beer and a margarita that was possibly the best margarita I've ever had.  The flavors were very balanced and the glass was rimmed with a peppery paprika, a very nice touch.

For our appetizers, we ordered the shrimp cerviche and guacamole and empenadas to share.  Everything was spectacular.  The empenadas had me making a \"mmm\" sound as I chewed.  And, the guacamole was without a doubt the best guacamole I've ever head. Since dining at Valdez, my husband and I have actually tried to figure out what makes it so much better than every other guacamole we've had.  The plantain, yucca, and potato chips was also a nice change from the typical tortilla chips served.

For our entrees, we shared the chicken fajita and the pupusa dish.  Both were delicious, and we ate everything on our plates.

Even though we were quite full, we decided to try the tres leche rice pudding dessert.  This was the only item we ordered that we were disappointed in.  The dessert was very average, which is fine.  I think we were just expecting more since everything else we ate was fantastic.

Lastly, our server was fantastic.  She explained the menu very well, and she was always there if she noticed we might need to order another margarita.  We also only waited for maybe ten minutes to get our appetizer and only five to get our margarita.

I've noticed on this board that not everyone is loving Valdez.  For people thinking about dining at Valdez, we visited after the restaurant had been open for about a week and a half.  Everything we ordered was beyond delicious, and we didn't experience anything but fantastic service.  I therefore assume that many of the people who weren't blown away by the restaurant went while the restaurant was still figuring out its menu, etc.  Therefore, I encourage you to try the restaurant for yourself.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good tapas menu. Could use a bit more fish and veg on the menu. All food was delish. Especially the chips and guacamole. Nom nom. 

Nice semi covered roof patio. 

We enjoyed and will be back. 

Make reservations to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"I cheated on my girlfriend La Carnita and got caught.

What a disappointment. The atmosphere when you enter may be \"cool\" looking, but no deeper than a Jack Astors once you settle in. The food was Ok, but is not anything out of the ordinary for the amount being charged, I felt because I was in the entertainment district the price was jacked whereas comparing to Lee down the street there was no oomph factor. The Chaufa fried rice + duck confit + edamame + egg + papi kung fu + chili + tobiko belonged in a thai restaurant and the Sizzling fajita 1/2 chicken + flour tortilla + sofrito + crema + guacamole + cheddar belonged at a Tex Mex grill in a strip mall. The kicker and piss off here is paying $4.00 for extra chips to finish your Guac. and believe me you need them as clearly there is a chip shortage on King Street.

The beef skewers, meatballs and Empanadas were good but nothing to write home about. The final ripoff was the margarita \"pitcher\" which is no more than a glass jar and barely 4 drinks.

Won't be back $168.00 later (WTF??).

Service was fine.

Chairs are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Not sure why Yelp shows this as closed. Definitely still exists - right across the street from LEE. 
Food is great, try the chaufa you won't be disappointed. We got all of the happy hour appetizers and most were delicious. 

The ceviche was incredible - highly recommend it. Wish they had a corn cotija dish!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The decor is amazing. They make really tasty drinks and I felt well taken care of by the staff. I will definitely go again."}

{"text":"Food was really good. Really enjoyed the dishes ordered. The ceviche was delicious. We love the sauce! 

We also orders the rice dish, empanadas,! Yum! 

Service is friendly!

Love the atmosphere! Can be a bit loud so have to raise ur voice to talk to your friends!"}
{"text":"Valdez has an amazing Latin atmosphere, it is perfect for a night out with friends or with your significant other. The music was great and we even enjoyed a little \"salsa\" dancing, which was probably wine induced, although fun regardless. We went on a Friday night.
The food was good, we just asked our server to bring out multiple plates with some of her favourites, and we were satisfied with them. Unfortunately for this reason I am unable to name the specific dishes but the portions were reasonable and we did enjoy them.
This place was a little pricy for what they offered but the overall experience was great and so I would say it was worth it. They have a great wine selection and the service was good.
I am told they have a great patio as well although I did not go up and see.
Would I go back? Yes but probably not for a while because I feel there are many other places just as good or better in Toronto."}
{"text":"VALDEZ! You had so much potential.

After hearing about some of the yummy sounding dishes Valdez has to offer, and being a big lover of tapas, I was SUPER excited to check this place out. Sadly, I got my hopes up way, way too high.

The space is really gorgeous and loungey, with some couches, bar seating, high chairs, etc. The vibe is pretty cool and the bathrooms are covered in some awesome wall art of video game characters and cartoon characters. There is a very nice rooftop patio, too!

Our server was super friendly at the start, but as the night went on that friendliness disappeared, and as did she, as we did not see her very much. The service was pretty awful. After our inital order was taken, the ceviche's came out with a small wait, that was okay. After the ceviche's there was waiting, waiting, waiting, oh yeah, and a little more waiting. Our server asked us twice \"Oh, you haven't gotten item ABC yet? Or item DEF yet?\", but not sure if she actually checked on the status of our order until after the second time. It ended up that there was a mix-up and most of our order was not put through. 

The night was a long night full of waiting rediculous amounts of time for our food to come, even after the order was properly put in. In addition, some of the items were STILL forgotten, and we had to remind our server several times. One of my dining companions did not get her drink order the entire night.

Onto the FOOD:

A LOT of it was mediocre at best, and I felt like I've made better in my own kitchen, and I'm not too much of a chef!

Culpes: yummy bar food snack, but definitely lacking chicharpm
Chips & Gauc: our server sold us on how amazing this dish would be because of their top notch guac, but really, the guac wasn't that great. Uninspired dish.
Croquetas: Not great. Little to no flavour.
Empanadas: BAD. Like, really bad. Bad flavour, bad texture, stick to Kensington Market for these bad boys. Really, pretending a pizza pop was an empanada would be better than eating this.
Pastel: MMMMMMMMMMMMMmmm. If all the dishes were as amazing as the Pastel I would maybe forgive the awful service. These were little bites of cream cheese, guava pasted, stuffed in a yummy wonton wrapper. J'adore.
Chuzos al Plancha: beef skewers with chimichurri & arepa. These were also super awesome. Chimmichurri kicked but, and the arepa was delightfully delicious. One of the better things on the menu.
Chorizo Prok with Arepas: The saving grace of this dish was more of the yummy arepas. Unfortunately, the chorizo was very dry and lacked the good fat a nice chorizo has.
Chicken Fajitas: Don't. Just don't. You can make better fajitas with an Old El Paso Kit at home.

I am normally super gung ho about trying dessert, but this place was so uninspiring I didn't want to take a gamble.

Drinks are small and very pricy, so I didn't try any.

Kind of a sad experience. Valdez definitely has potential, but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon, even with the alure of the amazing Pastel and pretty rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Decided to give Valdez a try after hearing that it opened just a week ago. One thing I was glad to hear upon entering was that they actually take reservations. It is unfortunate how many new restaurants have a no reservations policy.

I ordered a dark and stormy to start after seeing that they had ginger beer on tap and my friend ordered a pint of beer. His beer came up first in a small glass that looked a bit smaller than a half-pint and was $5. My dark and stormy came shortly after and it was pretty tiny as well and cost $10.

We split an order of chips and guac, empanadas and pastel (after the bartenders suggestion) and I ordered the chaufa (duck confit on fried rice).

The guac ($8) was very tasty with a nice citrus taste. We ordered extra chips ($4) which made it a higher priced small bowl of guac.

The empanadas on the other hand were extremely salty and was probably the worst empanada I've ever had. For $9 you get 3 or 4 small empanadas which is quite high considering it is one of the cheapest eats in spanish countries.

The pastel ($6) was a really delicious treat with a nice combo of sweet and salty.

The chaufa ($17) was again very salty. The portion size was ok but at $17 for fried rice with a bit of duck I think it is well overpriced. I've had better fried rice on Spadina for much cheaper.

The drink list looks great but is on the pricey side and after getting the tiny dark and stormy I wasn't about to pay $10-$15 for a few more sips of a cocktail. After all, it would be gone in seconds due to my mouth needing liquids to wash out the salty taste. I opted for a Negra Modelo beer ($6) which is probably the best value on the list.

The bill came to $73.45 for everything.

Valdez conclusions:

- Staff were all very friendly during the visit.
- Prices are too high (I'd rather go to Grand Electric for a much tastier meal)
- Food was either way too salty or good, but over priced
- Drinks are small so order a bottle of beer
- Venue is very nice

I will not be returning.

The space itself is very nice

2* rating based primarily on the pricing and the food I ate: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"I was invited to my sisters bday party at Valdez, a trendy Latin infused restaurant.  Their take on \"Latin Street food\" really hit home with my taste buds!  We were located in the upper area of the restaraunt other wise known as \"Tio's Patio\"  The rooftop patio is open year round as its partially enclosed and heated as well.  There is ample seating and its own bar area.  You will also find \"Tio's BBQ\" which many of the latin street foods can be served.  We had a selection from \"Tio's BBQ menu\" ranging from Drunken Shrimp with a smoked jalapeno salsa to Beef short ribs.  My favorite was the Choripan and Chorizo with chipolte mayo and baguettes.  A great little meal if your sitting on this awesome patio.  I found all the dishes we had were cooked right and had that \"latin\" flavor that I was hoping for.  I will definitely come back at another date to try out the dining area downstairs.  I quickly took a look at the dinner menu and they have quite the selections of Ceviche and other entrees that looked tempting The staff was excellent and very accomidating.  4 stars for me!!"}
{"text":"I don't really see what the big deal is about this place. I went with a large group so we had a fixed price menu for $42+18% gratuity. The food was decent - the duck confit fried rice was good. Not worth the price IMO. There are tons of good mexican places downtown where you'll get better value. The other problem with this place is that they won't split the bill which is super annoying when you have a large group. It took us an extra 20 min to settle the bill so unfortunately they couldn't turn the table over right away. C'mon Valdez, get with it."}
{"text":"Best grilled broccoli!!!!
The staff is great.  If you are looking for a great quick meal with many friends go!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, venue, location! Definitely recommended by Toronto locals. Great place for a date, celebration or starting your night. Rooftop can be fun as well but doesn't include the full menu. Everything is tasty!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. A really good variety of tapas styled Latin food. We tried a couple of ceviches and both were good and a whole host of other items. A huge favourite on the table was the duck fried rice. Service was good and all and all a good time."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place for late lunch after wandering around downtown for the afternoon. We did not check the Yelp reviews first, sadly - but luckily you have.

Lunch was all small plates - fairly pricey for what they are, but really that's not the big issue.

The major issue is the completely absurd speed of service. The patio was busy, but certainly not packed and there appeared to be enough staff on the floor. Just not enough coming out.

We waited over an hour for three small plates to be served - at intervals of about 15 minutes apart. At that point, we cancelled our remaining dishes and paid the bill - to very significant attitude from the wait staff.

The food we did have was good - but it is impossible to separate the service from the food when it is this bad. 

The bar did seem to be putting out drinks at a good clip though - so if you want a patio with drinks and chips/salsa you may be ok. But sure don't go hungry!"}
{"text":"Worse experience ever
Check your bill, they overcharge for some items you never ask for.
And when you ask why, they will answer you with the most disrespectful attitude.
Don't even worth to try this place."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, tasty street food, not too expensive for the big portions."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting worse. I don't understand why they act all exclusive and busy (I've seen them turn down patrons that just wanted drinks at a table), when time after time any Latin American person I speak to about their experience there tell me a similar story about how the food is not good. I genuinely think the only ppl that actually like this place are all non Latinos. And mainly because they have no fucking clue what the food is supposed to actually taste like and the ingredients it's actually supposed to have in order to taste Great. We're all open to fusion (we'll call it that because Latin American Street Food THIS IS NOT), but this was no good.

Third time coming here, this time I came with a different group of friends, all Latinas. I came with a Mexican, 2 Venezuelans, a Chilean and myself (Peruvian).  

SERVICE:
Our waiter was rude and sarcastic when we asked him questions about the menu (because the \"street food\" they're trying to do is just odd fusion).

FOOD:
-how do you serve guacamole tapa style without anything to eat it with. Oh and iffff you want tortillas 2.75 lol what do you mean iffff? You mean people just get a sharing tapa plate with guacamole and they all take turns scooping it out? And this is called a tapa? No, valdez it's called a fucking side, or dipping plate if you're serving it alone. Don't try to make standalone guacamole a tapa. Lol naked. With nothing. Lol the Mexican was utterly confused and offended. But sure okay, we all went with it and paid for tons of tortillas because what else can you eat guacamole with?
-I tried the chaufa (typical Peruvian dish), and just... Please don't. Edamame beans in chaufa, how and why? It tasted like plain fried rice with Edamame. Just stop. 
-The grilled calamari was deeply underwhelming. 
-The Albóndigas and the Choripapa were the only decent things, if you messed up 3 meatballs and potatoes with sausage, then you really need to get out of the food biz.

DRINKS:
-The waiter got us glasses with water, we sat down and my gf realised there was a fly in the glass, gross! So she asked him for another glass, he seemed annoyed but he did, and came back and the glass he brought her still had lipstick marks from the last person that used it. Gross again. 
-My girlfriend ordered red wine, I decided to do the same... My glass came and there were 4 flies in my glass. How does this happen? You have to be either the dirtiest place on earth or the most careless and blind waiter to miss that. And when I pointed it out, he repeated what I said as if though I was exaggerating or lying lol. And then he saw it and was deeply apologetic and it s like all his attitude went out the window. Lol he knew he or valdez messed up. After that. I didn't want any wine or any water, nothing unsealed from this place. I opted for a sealed beer. Ugh.

At the end of the meals, when the bill came, he was nice enough to point to me (without me saying anything) that he had not charged me for the glass of wine. Why... How gracious of you Milord, seeing that I didn't drink it and there was a fly pool fest in my glass, it's the least you could do, but thanks for pointing out the great token of appreciation you bestowed upon me, by not charging me for the wine. You highly attentive and sensible man, you. 

TLDR:
Blah. 
One star because of the albóndigas and choripapa.
Minus stars for 1) the shitty waiter, 2) the four flies in my wine glass, 3) the one fly in my gfs water, 4) the glass with lipstick marks from random person

Talk about a horribly underwhelming, and gross experience. Oh, but the rooftop patio is nice."}
{"text":"Being an adult is pretty cool. I mean, I just dropped basically 80 bucks on a Tapas dinner, and I was like O M G, what am I doing with my lifffeeeeeee?! But then I ate the Tapas, and the Tapas was gooooodd. And I realized. HAHA FUCK YOU LIFE I AM AN ADULT, I CAN SPEND 80 DOLLARS ON 3 MARGARITAS AND 3 LITTLE BABY EMPANADAS. I AM A GROWN WOMAN.

But seriously, I loved my experience from Valdez top to bottom. Our couple friend invited us on a double date, and my boyf and I thought, hey why not? The menu seems legit & fun and if worst comes to worst, we could just get wasted on Tecate. 

I made a reservation through their on-line booking system, and received a call later that day confirming my reservation. Nice. We arrived early around 4 and started drinking on the rooftop patio, and although the patio was 'technically' closed for a private party, we were welcomed and served any ways. Also HAPPY 40th BIRTHDAY NICE LADY. The server was equal parts wildly excitable, warm and affable and service was pretty good even though all of the servers were focused on the private party. It was a great atmosphere too since their BBQ grill was going and some fantastic Latin music playing softly through the speakers.

YOU HAVE TO TRY THE MARGARITAS. I have never tasted anything that amazing in my life. I had a grapefruit Mejor and another 2 lime Beuno's and oooooo boy, they went down so easy and just tasted so good. Well worth the 40 bucks I basically paid for them. NO REGRETS. 

Our drinking started to wade into our reservation time, so one of us notified the hostess that we're just finishing up our drinks and would be down shortly, there was no fuss and we proceed to enjoy our drinks and finally went down around 5.20 to be seated. It was still quiet and practically empty at that time (and the restaurant only started to pop towards 6PM), so our initial service was pretty luxurious and accommodating. Our server was informative and explained + answered any questions we had about menu items.

My boyfriend and I opted to share a bunch of samples and here is a run down of what we ate:

1. Bay Scallop Ceviche - Scallops were divine and the ceviche was generally quite nice. Those fucking corn nuts threw me the frik off though. I could have done without those.

2. Empanadas - Holy Frik so good. Despite getting 3, I was pretty stuffed after one and a half. The ratio of dough to filling is kinda a let down, but the filling was flavourful and moist and the dough was equal parts doughy and crunch on the outside.

3. CHUZOS AL PLANCHA - Med-Rare Beef skewers with chimichurri, decent, can't complain, but I wasn't entirely blown away.

4. La Reina - smoked chicken guac on an arepa deep friend cracker. I was ALL OVER THIS, I mean, I wish I could wander life with a tub of gauc with me at all times, so obviously loved this like a mad hambeast. 

5. El Jardin - Nice lil' salad all to myself, everything was fresh and I lvoed the black salt sprinkled on top. 

I also sampled the croquetes and they were THE BOMB.

So yea, sweet spot, sweet staff, sweet drinks. 80 bucks well spent."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. I haven't tried the food, but the drinks are amazing. Lovely decor. Good crowd. Very good music at the back on Thursdays -Escobar (if I'm allowed to talk about it!)"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was great and service was excellent. We visited for our anniversary and really enjoyed our dinner at Valdez.

We started with an order of the ceviche flight platter and liked the variety. I personally liked the ahi tuna the best. The Chaufa was amazing of course but a bit overpriced at $25 for a plate of rice - my Chinese parents would be so disappointed that I paid that much for fried rice lol. Also loved the Chori Papa and the guacamole and chips were very good. It was a lot of food so be warned! 

Made a visit to the escobar afterwards and enjoyed the drinks and music despite the screaming bachelorette party next to us! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Be sure to double check your receipt if you go here. They overcharged us for chips--$24 for a bowl of chips and small guac. I only realized weeks later after looking over my receipts. 

They also charged us for the margarita check-in offer on yelp, after looking at our phones and ensuring that we check-in in front of them, but we caught that one. You'd think after such diligence spent monitoring the check-in that they would've remembered not to charge us for it.

We had some drinks and chips upstairs on the BBQ smoke-filled patio and then more mains downstairs.

It's an expensive night out, especially if they double charge you for a bowl of overpriced chips. 

They were busy but I didn't think the food and drinks were that amazing. Everything was fairly good but nothing worth lining up for.

I had gone at lunch before and it was a better experience. It was less busy, staff was very friendly and the food tasted better. The lunch and dinner experiences are like night and day (literally). 

It's a shame because I really enjoyed my lunch there, as well as the sausage dish that was facing off against another restaurant at Marben for a sausage competition. I had the dish again the night of disappointment and it wasn't as good as I remembered it. 

I can't say after my most recent experience that I would be in any hurry to go back. There's enough great spots for dinner and drinks in the area that don't rip you off."}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of Valdez! So much that I went twice within a week. Seriously.

The vibe is really fun, great for a late date night or a night out with friends. The music is great and the crowd just feels good, you know?

The servers are super on top of things, they're friendly and conversational and make lots of great informed recommendations from their menu. The first time I tried a bunch of shared items, all of which were excellent, and the next time I tried the chefs tasting menu (YUM!). Everything was fresh and so flavourful. Also, they are super gluten free friendly, if you need it! 

The cocktails are also so delicious, and I am certainly a sucker for margaritas by the pitcher. Nothing is better! 

What's even better is that you can finish up your night in their speakeasy, Escobar. On Saturday's there is a line, be ready! Friday is more my speed - a little less crowded and music I really appreciate. 

What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Latin music, rooftop patio lounge on King west, and a not-so-secret speakeasy lounge hidden by a freezer door (called Escobar).... what's not to like?!

Not exactly a quiet place for conversation, but that's not why you're here. The atmosphere is electric, and it's a great place to start a good night out with friends. You can even bust out a few dance moves upstairs if you're up for it. 

Food is average, but doesn't hit any home runs in my books. I wouldn't come here to seek anything specific on the menu, but if you must, the BBQ menu upstairs is good to snack on. 

The only drawback is that it can get really busy at times, and drinks can get pretty expensive. Service can be slow as well, so be prepared to make trips to the bar."}
{"text":"Went to Valdez for the first time last night with some friends for a few drinks. 

Spent the night on the rooftop drinking and dancing away. Great music and DJ - kept the dance floor moving all night! 

The bar had surprisingly quick service considering how busy it was, drinks were strong and fairly priced for sure. 

Full of beautiful people and a really great place to have a fun Friday night! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The beers are $6, but they do not tell you that they are served in tiny half pints. $12 for a pint of standard beer is outrageous. They are going for a club vibe, so the music is insanely loud, making it impossible to have a conversation over dinner. Service was sub par, we had to ask bus boys for napkins and water that our server neglected to give us. We spent a lot of time waiting for the bill, waiting for new drinks, etc and then had a suggested 25% gratuity on or bills. I didn't enjoy the experience and would not return. 

There is also a 2 hour max on the patio, lame."}
{"text":"Ever have an overattentive waiter who was acting as if he was on reality show?

Not a fun experience. 

Came to Valdez, which was the worst dining experience I had in Toronto by far. 

The food was subpar. It wasn't anything special, I've had much better. Our waiter kept pressuring us to get more food even though I wasn't in the mood for anything else. 

Yes I understand the dishes are small. I ate a lot today and I'm not looking for much. Yes I'm sure. 
Am I sure that I'm sure? 
Yes I'm sure. 

He convinced my friend to get Ceviche which we split. It was bad, very bland. We split the Chafua, once again on his recommendation and once again it bombed. Dude, I really was just in the mood for some Arepas or Empanadas. 

The waiter would approach us as if there was a camera on him and was even being a bit snobby. As if he knew best on everything. Then would check in on us every three minutes and if we didn't get something, he would stare at us with a confused look. 

No we're not drinking right now. We don't want anything to drink, for the fifth time. 

Overall I didn't like my experience at Valdez and can't recommend it to anyone. Looked nice, but that's about it."}
{"text":"i did not get to try their food as i ate across the street at lee's! 

HOWEVER i will be coming back for sure. its everything i look for when going out in toronto on a friday night. a chill vibe, good music, nice bartenders and a happy crowd. they have an upstairs patio area which was empty when i first arrived but quickly filled up by 11:30 ish. we headed downstairs to sit at the bar to chill on our drinks. you could still hear the music throughout. 

we then find out about the escobar-after finding out the password (thanks nice thor-looking bartender) we got to hang out in there for awhile. SO COOL. they played everything i wanna hear when im wine buzzed (drake obviously..) a good mix of old and new hip hop
we went back upstairs to the patio and found it to be packed with the dj spinning latin music mixed with top 40 hits. couples were salsa'ing , friends were jamming it was perfect for a night out.  

cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times, I am a big fan of their Michelada and their beers overall. The plates I recommend are: Arepitas or Empanadas (small, but if you are a colombian you'll be impressed) Quesadillas (really good and filling) Maduro (If you are craving to have the best plantain dish in the whole city, this is the one) Chori Papa (they claim this is the best dish the restaurant has, now for this dish I've had two different experiences, the first time I had it, it was not that spicy, it was very mild and I loved it, the second time my tongue was burning in the first bite, but I would love to relive the first experience again.) 

For you to have a comfortable experience in the restaurant, you have to arrive early when the waiting is not going to suffocate you. 

The Patio transforms into a party and the lights go dimmer about 9pm, but the tables get cleared at about 11pm. 

Highly recommended one of the best latin restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"This place is majorly stinkatron. 

Very gorgeous space. The goodness ends there, truly.

We had a large party of 18 booked for a holiday party. They had a $45 set menu per person. They also had a more expensive version ($65) which we wanted, but when we tried to book this well in advance (several days before) we were told that they didn't have some of the ingredients to make the extra dishes. Hrm.

Anyway, moving on. The food is really just absolutely terrible. For $45 it was a joke. NOTHING tasted good. On the entire menu the only decent 3 star item was a stir-fried rice dish topped with duck, it was only tasty because it had a lot of spice. The fajitas were disgustingly bland. Every dish that came out lacked seasoning. Most of the other things were greasy type appetizers, empanadas and such. There were some beef skewers which were also very bland.

The service was good, drinks were decent but honestly the food was just so terrible."}
{"text":"Valdez is almost single handedly succeeding in bringing me back to an area of the city I have tried to avoid for several years! Most of this is attributed to their philosophy of a venue that embraces and combines the multicultural and trendy aspects of nightlife in Toronto. More impressively, you can feel a sense of camaraderie amongst the staff who really seem to be enjoying what they do whether behind the bar or the grill. I have not yet met the man behind the idea, but nearly all other staff I have interacted with have left a very positive impression. Rafael, one of the sous-chefs is a truly down to earth, humble and talented individual, and I am fairly certain the same is true for his counterpart Andre! I have regularly been impressed by the food I have tried here, which is rarity for venues where many come to drink / party. On that front, Corey has proven to be a barkeep of considerable skill! While the bar is primarily armed for making tequila based cocktails, this chap does a fantastic job of improvising off menu when faced with the challenge. 

In brief, you know you have found a good spot when you regularly meet other restauranteurs and industry folks having a drink at the bar. The blog by Steve Gonzalez (http://valdezrestaurant.com/blog/) and Valdez's involvement with initiatives such as the Underground Chef Cartel further proves that this team knows and enjoys what they are doing. Hopefully this fresh approach will be embraced by others on the block."}
{"text":"The experience started off not bad, the hostess greeted us and showed us upstairs to the patio.

The space was nice, but the service was beyond terrible - unprofessional and inefficient!

We waited a good 5 minutes before our waiter came with our menu and asked us what to drink. Then we waited patiently for our waiter to come to take our orders. However he was busy attending to other tables and we kept looking to get some eye contact with the waiter or the 2 people working at the bar. But no one acknowledged us for a good 10-15 minutes, so my group and I walked out.

As we left, the same hostess said, \"thanks for coming, we hope you enjoyed your evening.\" 

What a joke! Does she really think their service is that efficient that we've ordered, been served our food and paid the bill within less than 20 minutes time?

Sad to say, I would not recommend Valdez to anyone at all until they can fix their service issues!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place.... But my most recent visit just wasn't up to par. 

The \"hostess\" greeted us at the door on a sunny Sunday afternoon,  and we say that we're just interested in popping up to the patio for drinks.   She snarkily states \"well,  if you're not eating then we may not have a table available for you\". 

First off,  the patio was not even half full with over a dozen empty tables.   Secondly,  the $25 pitchers of sangria are likely much more profitable than selling food....  And I can drink more than I can eat.   Finally,  if you're the damned hostess,  just smile and look pretty while welcoming us warmly and bring us to a table - aren't you supposed to know how many tables are available.  

Just a horrible way to be greeted at what used to be one of my preferred king west spots.   All because of one tart of an idiotic employee.  Smarten up Valdez and realize you're in the hospitality business."}
{"text":"I went here for casual Saturday drinks on the patio. There was a long table set up, which about 5000 people tried to sit at throughout the evening with the waitress telling each person, there's a reservation here for 20 for later. Maybe... oh I don't know... put a reserved sign on it? Eventually those people did show up and sat on their phones all night. Ahh youth!
We had the Octopus, chicken wings, chips and guacamole, and something else I can't remember. The Octopus is just one massive tentacle served in a cardboard bowl, which for the vegans at our table was a bit much. Sucks to be them because it was delicious!
Way too many beers and margaritas later, we left and the bill came to $180.00 for four after drinking for 5 hours, so not too bad (beers were $3.00 from 4-7pm)."}
{"text":"I was scammed into paying to attend a Tromba promotional event. Event included bite sized snacks to nibble on and small samples of tequila. We were left hungry, sober, and thoroughly disappointed. We had to go to another restaurant to finish the meal. It was a disappointing evening and has turned me off Tromba and Valdez."}
{"text":"*This review is only for the ambience and drinks at the bar, since we didn't come here to eat*

A few of us ladies decided to have a great night with some great cocktails, and walked into Valdez. We had areally good time. The music was upbeat, crowd was decent and we could chat amongst ourselves with some great cocktails uninterrupted. I didn't seem to have any issues with service that others have noted, but that's probably because we were at the bar. The bartended kept recommending stuff and we tried most of their drinks, Iw as quite impressed with the off-beat flavours and presentation. Some of the drinks had a nice tangy taste. To end with, we ordered the Bloody Caesar, and it was a well-balanced tangy drink with paprika on the rim - didn't taste like the too-spicy or watered down versions that you get at a lot of places.

I'll go back to try the food."}
{"text":"I'm a bit biased because I love the chuafa BUT no one mentioned sitting in the patio would mean not getting the regular menu or experiencing the full foods offered at Valdez.  

The patio itself was fun and had great ambiance.  It looks to be winterized so during the cold there is still a patio that is open!

Unfortunately we were disappointed by the lack of foods offered on the patio and off we went to WVRST to soothe the tummy!!!"}
{"text":"Their food was nothing to write home about but the atmosphere is lovely, and our server was great! Their food is a little bland for the prices but I suppose it's the area and aura that you pay for. Drinks were so good! We'd come back, but only on payday (it's $25 for just plain chicken fajita's)."}
{"text":"First off, some of the reviews here cement my belief that the reason Toronto is generally a food wasteland -- at least for a city of 6 million -- is because Torontonians are mostly uncultured ex-suburbanites. (Seriously, is there anyone over the age of 25 who grew up south of St. Clair?) Valdez is not Spanish food, and it's not Mexican food. Don't compare it to Patria or Grand Electric just because the menus are all in the same language.

Anyways, as I am wont to do with restaurants on my home turf of King West, I had low expectations for Valdez. The reviews have been quite mixed and it felt like the recent opening of the restaurant was trying to cash in on the \"street food\" trend. We ordered the four-course tasting menu, which really ended up being a five-course menu with a ridiculous amount of food for $57. Regardless of what you think of the food, you definitely will get your money's worth here. I'm confused by all the reviews claiming it is overpriced.

Things started off slow with a decent chips and guac (the guac has a nice texture and citrus acidity but is otherwise a little bland) and a plate of four oysters with some sort of watermelon mignonette which I absolutely hated, as it covered up any hint of briny oyster goodness. Next up was a sampler of three ceviches; I didn't care for the tuna-and-watermelon one (tasteless) or the shrimp one (too chewy), but the mixto, with mussels/octopus/squid, was fantastic.

The chef came out ahead of our next course and cryptically apologized \"for the slow start.\" I'm not sure if he was reading our lips or if he knew those dishes weren't in the kitchen's wheelhouse, but he was right that things would only get better from there. Next up was a \"street party\" platter of beef skewers, chorizo, rice and beans, arepas and some sort of fried tortilla topped with guac and smoked tuna. This was a meal in itself, no bite-sized tasting menu portions here. Everything was fantastic except for the beef skewers which I found a little tough and undersalted.

From there we had the whole steamed branzino for two, and ended with a dessert sampler with a fruit ice pop, rice pudding and a mini chocolate souffle. The fish was perfectly cooked and served with a fantastically creamy potato salad, but is a pretty subtle dish compared to the rest of the food. The desserts were all good, with the souffle a particular standout.

Our waiter was very friendly and we were never left unattended for more than a few minutes. The complete lack of pretension was very refreshing for King West. One of the better service experiences I've had in the city. Drinks were pretty good and fairly priced.

Overall I am giving this three stars because of how weak the first half of the meal was -- Valdez would otherwise be a four-star place. That said, I'll definitely be back for more of the cooked dishes and will see what happens then."}
{"text":"Kind of surprised by all the negative reviews here, because I REALLY enjoyed my experience at Valdez and the food, but maybe I'm just basic? Originally wanted to try their upstairs patio, but I thought their regular menu had more variety (as opposed to the BBQ menu upstairs), so we sat on their back patio instead, which was also lovely but just lacking the view. My group ordered a fairly large number of different things here, and I quite enjoyed all of them.

Scallop ceviche ($16) - this comes in a smaller portion for $4, which is good if you want to try like, a bite. The ceviche was really delicious and came with really fresh scallops, which I enjoyed a lot. Definitely a pretty pricey dish though, because even the full sized portion was not that big.

Empanadas ($7 for 3 pieces) - Some people complained that this was too bready, which I kind of agree with, but tbh I liked the bread, so the breadiness didn't bother me. This wasn't super memorable for me, but I know I enjoyed it.

Fried chicken wings ($7 for 3 pieces) - The guava BBQ sauce is delicious... just a little bit sweet and tangy, worth a try.

Chori papa ($12 + 4 tortillas for $3) - Really really liked this because it had pork, potatoes, chipotle mayo, and goat cheese... and I love goat cheese. Was a sizeable portion, definitely too much to fill 4 tortillas but it was delicious on its own anyways.

Chaufa ($22) - Yes, I know it's just like fried rice, and tbh with the edamame and tobiko it does seem more like Asian fusion rather than Latin street food. But you know what, it was delicious regardless of what ethnicity it borrowed from, and that's good enough for me. 

5 items for 3 people was definitely a bit too much, and we ended up not finishing the chaufa and just taking most of it to go. As with most tapas-type places, the prices can start adding up pretty quickly, but I think it only ended up being less than $30 per person, which really wasn't that bad. Every single dish we had was full of flavour but wasn't overpowered by salt. No complaints about the service, and we got free margaritas for checking in on Yelp! (They were okay, not the best, but free so I can't complain.) I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I am only giving them 3 stars because of the loud music. The food was really good. We were sitting at the patio enjoying our drinks and food and having a conversation. All of the sudden their DJ started playing and the music was loud to the point that not only we could not have a conversation but also hour hears hits and we were forced to get our bill and leave.
We asked them twice to lower the music but they did not take any action.
FYI - we are all in our 30's so we do appreciate loud music at a bar but not over dinner when you try to have a proper conversation."}
{"text":"Margaritas by the litre. The food is pretty good. But the chairs /seating is horrible. And the server didn't know what drink we had ordered from the name on the menu. Good place to go drinking though."}
{"text":"I really like the transformation of this place from Cheval to Valdez, the atmosphere and vibe was really good and really liked their rooftop patio.
I had sampled some of Steve Gonzalez's food at some events and it was all good and the food here would not disappoint. Steve remembered me for a prior meeting and he's one great talented chef.

The restaurant is managed by Laughlin, for those who live or work in the area he used to work at Jimmy's Coffee. I booked a large table on the roof patio for my office, but was taken when I arrived due to their reservations system not working, but Laughlin miraculously clear the large table for my party at a moment's notice. He knows how to take care of his customers!

The rooftop has it's own BBQ and had neat communal bathrooms which had one-way mirrored window with a view of the roof patio.

The only fault was that the drinks were a bit on the pricey side. I ordered 2 pisco sours and it came to $30 and their happy hour specials touts $4 drought beers, but they were served in small half-pints cups and their $6 margaritas were nothing special. I found myself eventually sticking to their decent selection of bottled Mexican beers, though their cocktails served in large mason jars looked really good and seems to be also popular at the bar. The service was generally great there, though the one bartender did look really disinterested and was, luckily her other fellow bartender was very nice and made up for her unattentiveness. 

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have never been so insulted in my life. The food was so so but when we tried to get into the club the bouncer insulted my group calling it the worst looking pieces of shit ever!

Definitely not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"What a great find, one of the cooler spots on King West if you're looking to grab dinner and a drink before bar hopping. 

Really liked how the waiters come by to explain everything about each dish as they bring it to the table. The place is branded as 'street food', but the interior has a very nice, has a hipster vibe to it.

I went with a group of 4, we ordered a few of the dishes to share. Really loved the Chorizo Sausage, perfect for a group of 4 to have half a sausage each. The beef skewers were cooked medium, again small portions but very tasty. The ceviche was the only dish that was sub-par, but nonetheless we had a great time."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a casual supper on a weeknight. Skip the empanadas; they're good, but they'll ruin the meal for you - too heavy. The duck fried rice was great! There's a patio upstairs and a patio on the side. The one on the side overlooks a brick wall, so go upstairs."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever in this place last weekend. The staff is completely rude and unrespectful. I have never feel so unrespected in my life. They use their \"policy\" according to their convenience. Me and my friends have been here before but all of the sudden they say that you can only enter if you have a canadian ID, which is very discriminatory. Me and my wife have them but half of our friends don't so they couldn't even go inside. Not only this, they said very offensive words to us. The \"head of security\" of this place, who should give a good impression and make everyone feel safe, attacked us with no argument and with terrible offensive words, specially to my wife who he called a \"fucking whore\" when she was only trying to clarify everything up. What type of man is this guy that goes trough life insulting women? I will never go to this place again and I recommend everyone who read this avoid it too."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised that Valdez generated so much hatorade on here! I urge you, fellow Yelpers, go back and try it again. The rooftop patio is the tops, and your dinner will be made oh-so-great if you check out their sweet check in offer on the app. Helloooo free margarita, where have you been all of my life? 

King W is normally not my scene, a little too grown-up-frat-boy-ish, but once in a while I end up somewhere on this stretch and am pleasantly surprised. 

Sunshine. Latin BBQ treats. Tequila cocktails. Tequila cocktails. Tequila cocktails. Floor."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Not the biggest standout along King West, but still fun. Great patio scene (one on the roof, one on the main floor down the alley) post work. Sometimes they have good happy hour until 7 - where drinks are cheap. Afterwards, not so much. 
Great guac and salsa with root chips. 
Service is quick and friendly. 
Generally the crowd is diverse...after work business, to hipsters, to glam."}
{"text":"O, Valdez, I had such high hopes!!! Came here with a group of 8 for Friday dinner + drinks + dancing.  We ordered a bunch of shareables - empanadas, beef skewers, chips & guac. The empanadas were a little heavy on the 'fried' and not enough on the filling for my taste, while the chips & guac and beef skewers were satisfactory. Nothing spectacular though, as they could have used a bit more seasoning and the guac had a very strange Indian vibe (too much cumin??). Everybody in our group agreed that the desserts were NOT good, but I liked tres leches pudding enough... but again, not spectacular. 

The service was good, and we were able to buy a whole BOTTLE of Aguardiente, which was pretty cool, because I've never seen another place sell it by the bottle, but that still doesn't make up for our post-dinner experience...

With a name like Valdez and a menu featuring empanadas and similar fare, you'd think the music would match. And it did, kinda, when we arrived. But by the time we headed upstairs for a little dancing it was terrible Top 40 bleh. So not what we were in the mood for and not what we expected. We stayed for maybe 20 minutes and headed back to our friends' place to have our own latin dance party. It's really unfortunate too, because that patio is pretty fantastic."}
