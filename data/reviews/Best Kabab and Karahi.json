{"text":"Worst kabab and karahi: What an absolute disgrace this place is for Pakistani food. We ordered seekh kabab, tikka and lamb karahi. The karahi was basically some curry with lamb pieces in it and they put cream in it, thus making it sweet. Who puts cream in karahi, this is the worst karahi I have ever tasted and I have had my fair share of karahis. Even calling this thing karahi should be a crime. Next the seekh kabab, they were burnt from one side and raw pink from the other, meaning only one thing, the dude making it never turned/rotated the skewers. The tikka was dry and hard.  Never ever going back to this place again."}
{"text":"I don't often do deliveries for dinner but feeling lazy, my boyfriend convinced me to hunt for a place I wanted to try on an online delivery site. Taking a look at a bunch of different menus, we decided on Best Kabab and Karahi. Although this place only has one other Yelp review, the prices of this place make it worth checking out.   We made a large order online consisting of Lamb Biryani, Karahi Gosht, Aloo Baingan, BBQ Lamb Chops, Beef Kebab Wrap and three different types of Naan (Tandoori, Butter and Garlic). Shortly after ordering, we received a call telling us they didn't have Aloo Baingan and BBQ Lamb Chops. Disappointed, we replaced the dishes with Butter Chicken and Palak Paneer.  The expected delivery time was stated to be an hour but 30 minutes after ordering, we heard a knock on the door. Talk about quick delivery! We eagerly opened the packages excited to dig into the yummies bundled within.  The Karahi Gosht (a lamb dish made with bell peppers and spices), Butter Chicken (a mild curry with a tomato base), and Palak Paneer (pureed spinach with chucks of cottage cheese) were among the first dishes revealed. They arrived in small round Styrofoam containers, smartly wrapped with cling wrap to prevent leakage. These were definitely smaller than what we had expected but for the prices we paid, it seemed reasonable. Next we took out a large Styrofoam container, it was the Lamb Biryani. The portion was huge and it was filled to the brim with rice.  We unwrapped the Naans and couldn't wait to dig into the deliciousness that awaited us. Butter Chicken is one of my favourite Indian dishes so I've had it at quite a few places but this place didn't disappoint. The sauce was nice and creamy yet it wasn't too thick. The pairing went well with the plain and butter naan. The chicken itself was good and cooked nicely but it was nothing special and didn't really stand out for me.  The Lamb Biryani was a dish I really wanted to try at this place. Being Hakka (and having most of my mother's side of the family born and raised in India), my mother always made biryani and it was always one of my favourite dishes as a kid. I really enjoyed the biryani at Best Kabab and Karahi. The rice was beautifully seasoned and the chunks of lamb were tender and fell apart as you picked it up. My only concern was the bone in the lamb... I wasn't expecting it to have the bone-in but at least the bones were large so you could see and feel them before putting it into your mouth.  I've actually never tried paneer before and it was recently suggested that I give it a try by a friend. I'm not a huge fan of cottage cheese so I was kind of hesitant on ordering it but since they didn't have the aloo, I figured it was a good time to give it a try. I adore spinach; it's one of veggies that I enjoy the most, whether it is saut√©ed, boiled, steamed, or raw. I love spinach. So when I tried the Palak Paneer, I wasn't surprised that I was a fan. However, I was surprised that I was a fan of the paneer chunks. The softness and smoothness of the paneer made it really appealing to have in my mouth. The texture was different from the texture you expect in a tub of cottage cheese (the westernized ones) you get at the grocery store. Although it does have some similarities in texture, the subtle taste paired great with the creamy spinach. I had most of this dish with the garlic naan and it was great. I had never had Palak Paneer before but it'll be a dish I'll be ordering from now on.  The Karahi Gosht wasn't a dish I ordered so I just had a small bite. I don't do well with spicy so my palette was completely on fire. However, what I did taste was a tender lamb covered in spices and packed with a spicy kick. It didn't taste bad but it was too spicy for me. Overall, I had a pretty decent experience with Best Kabab and Karahi. The prices are fair and the portions are not bad. I do believe that I'll be ordering here again and I'm curious on trying some of the other dishes they have to offer."}
{"text":"Best kabab and Karahi is one of the best places you can go. Huge portions and the flavors are genuine. Everything is immaculate at this restaurant and the prices are extremely fair too. One of my favorite spots to get take out by far. 5/5 no doubt!"}
{"text":"We got the chicken boneless biryani and chicken tikka wrap. Price was very reasonable and the portion sizes were large. Food overall was delicious !"}
{"text":"I order take out from here about twice a month. They also do delivery if you are in the area. Open late nights til 2am.  I usually order the beef seekh kababs Chicken kababs Chicken biryani Which are spicy but excellent  Stick with the main food specials you won't be disappointed. I strayed one and ordered the fish pakora and shrimp masala. The fish pakora were frozen pieces of over salted fish cut bite size and fried. It was kind of slimy.  The shrimp masala was OK, small tiny shrimp swimming in sauce, not worth the price.  All in all, this place is really inexpensive. It is also halal for those who only eat halal."}
{"text":"Their food did not disappoint. Happy customers and satiated tummies.  We ordered palak paneer, paratha, Karahi gosht and chicken biriyani. I asked that the biriyani be spicy, and the cook delivered on that request. Palak paneer was creamy and delightful. The karahi gosht was quite flavourful.  They also deliver, and service prompt and courteous.  Only complaints: A $5 delivery charge was added at the time of delivery, which I don't mind paying but wish they had informed us of same. Also, if you choose to pay via credit/debit make sure to confirm the debit terminal is in working order. Despite them confirming that their debit/credit terminal was in working order - just before delivery - the driver informed me that the terminal wasn't working. However, they got the thing  to function and delivered on time."}
