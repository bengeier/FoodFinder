{"text":"I really can't believe the low rating on this place. It's one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto, and by far, favourite turkish. 

What to get:
Mixed pide, iskender kebab, Adana kebab. Get with Irayn!"}
{"text":"The best Turkish food in Toronto. I love their Iskender Kebab and mant?. 100% authentic, as if I was eating them in Turkey. Their adana kebab is also delicious. If you are looking for authentic Turkish food made by Turks, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My personal favorite for donair plates is Donair Kebob house DT.

But for sandwiches? this place tops it off- the fresh break/donair combo is just the best thing ever- take a bite? and its a PARTY in my mouth!

I have also tried the kebab plates/iskander etc- they are good but I prefer Persian style kebab.

Their cheese or meat pies/bread? are well made and fresh as well- but I prefer the Lebanese with pastries/meat pies."}
{"text":"We'd been craving shawarma, and this place fit the bill beautifully.  Delicious.  Only problem is that we got take-out to eat it at home, and now I want more."}
{"text":"Had the spinach and cheese Pide to go, it was pretty good, and my daughter loved. Will try check them out again when I pass by."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my wife and we both did not like the bland taste. The chicken doner was more a shawarma and the taste wasnt great."}
{"text":"This is the best kebab house in Toronto. The price is right, the pitas are house made, the plates are big and the meat is fresh. The Doner kebab is a fine mix from beef and lamb and for sure they have chicken Doner too."}
{"text":"We ordered here last night using JustEat.ca.  It quoted a 45 delivery slot.

1.5 hours later, our order wasn't delivered.  They arrived 2 hours after we placed a delivery, no call, no reason, no apology."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic turkish kebabs!  Everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Not the nicest kebab place. 

I went with family and ordered 3 kebabs but, they end up eating only the salads. 

We have experienced better kebabs, these ones are at low 10th percentile :-("}
{"text":"I went to Turkey last year because I heard it is the land of pudding. Pudding was indeed easy to find there. Now back in Toronto I've noticed all sorts of Turkish restaurants. So far this is the only one I have tried and I like it a lot. You can get lamacun there, which is thin crust wood oven pizza with minced meat on it. They also have the funny boat shaped pizzas called pide. And pudding!"}
{"text":"Before finding my new favorite Turkish place, Shirin Kebab used to be my #1! While it no longer holds that top spot for me, you should know that the food here is still GREAT!

Everything they make here is good; their Donair's are fantastic, their Pide's are fantastic, and they are still the only place I have found in Toronto that makes Pace soup (Lambs Head Soup).

Don't be turned off by the fact that this place looks like a hole in the wall take out place because the quality of the food holds up against any other traditional sit down Turkish restaurant. 

This place is family run and you can taste the passion that this family has for making food. They also make their bread fresh and serve it warm. It's perhaps some of the best bread I've had in any restaurant as well.

This place is absolutely worth your attention if you like Turkish cuisine."}
{"text":"I was here to get a chicken shawarma, they have very slow service even though many people were working, bad customer service as well.
The food didn't taste that great or fresh. 
First impression was very bad!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing find for some nice and affordable Turkish dishes. Not the best looking place to dine in but for a quick and affordable meal, i say yes to Shirin. My go-to is the $6.50 doner sandwich that comes in their freshly made bread. It is good for a meal alone. The Iskendar kabab at $16.50 was good too with thick tomato based sauce, just needed a little bit of spice/chilli for me. The best part was the dessert, trued the Kunefe, cheese based pastry, was freshly baked and yummy! If up to me, a doner sandwich and a kunefe is the perfect meal at Shirin's. Recommended"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner once and we absolutely loved it! We didn't opt for shawarma because that can be ordered at any Middle Eastern restaurant. We wanted to try authentic Turkish food and we were not disappointed. The kebab dishes we ordered were excellent and filling. They also came with orzo and a salad on the side. The Adana and Chicken Shish kebab dinners come with a grilled tomato which was extremely flavourful. I enjoyed that. The ground beef pide we had was very tasty. The Turkish milk pudding and chocolate pudding were topped with crushed pistachios and were rich but very flavourful. They even melt their own chocolate to make it. The two women serving us were very friendly and polite as well. We were even offered complimentary Turkish tea in the end. Overall experience was great!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy Turkish restaurant which may not be professional but the food is fresh and the environment is very clean. 
True, the waiting time is long (the waitress even looks shy) but looking on the positive side; it takes a while to cook the kebab medium at least. I'd rather wait and have my shawarma sliced after my order than it being sliced hours in advance and being kept in a steaming metal container, like some other \"fast shawarma\". 
They also sell imported Turkish juice and Turkish mineral water. 
Their kindest gesture is serving tea as a treat after the meal."}
{"text":"Tied in my book for the best shawarma sandwich in Toronto (Pita Grill in Mississauga is the other). Shirin Kebab house doesn't look like much from the outside but it offers very fresh Turkish fare, the highlight being their beef or chicken shawarma sandwich served on freshly baked Turkish bread. The bread, the meat, the fresh cut veggie toppings, and the light but satisfying sauce make this the perfect sandwich. Very friendly staff, prompt service, clean dining area. The extended menu of Turkish specialties like the home made pida gives most Neapolitan-inspired pizzerias a run for their Lira."}
{"text":"Came here recently with a friend and we both ending up getting the chicken shawarma. Now I eat Shawarma quite often and know which ones are good and which ones are not. This was not a good one. I have never been to this before and decided to try it because it seems to have been around for a while and it looked cleaner than most places. The guy made the shawarma and gave it to me without asking me what I wanted on it... this was the first time this has happened to me and he looked at me as if all Shawarma is the same. They only put lettuce, tomato and onion... no garlic sauce, no hot sauce, no tahini, no pickled turnip no nothing! When I upwrapped the wrapper from the Shawarma it was falling apart, the pita was torn and everything was falling out. They meat wasn't terrible but it was nothing that amazed me either. They had quite a bit of seating but none of the tables are were cleaned off. They had like 4 people working, 4 dirty tables and only 2 customers. Lazy... 

If you are in the area there are many more amazing Shawarma/ middle eastern places to eat other than here. Do you self the favour and get a quality product for cheaper down the road."}
{"text":"I would never go here again. Poor customer service. The doner had only salad and tomatoes. I ordered lahmacun and the lady said it will take 25 min to make. After 30 min she goes we forgot your ordered this ( there were only two other customers there). They didn't even bother giving an opener for the bottles and I had to get it myself, no napkins, and again I had to get them myself. So basically don't go if u want Turkish or any kind of customer care."}
{"text":"Food is good but place is dirty and the costumer service is terrible. I have been there a few times and  the lady in the cashier is always rude with me but nice with people that speak her language. :("}
{"text":"I was in the area and felt very hungry, I was about to go to the A&W inside the Petro Canada. When I saw this place across the street.

I ordered a chicken doner plate $12:99 it comes with rice and salad. And I ordered a can of ginger ale as it did not include a drink the total was about $16.

The girl who was. Behind the register had 
Competed the order and brought over to me within 30 seconds of me sitting down. She took the meat out of a hot plate along with the rice.
 The meat smelt rotten, the salad with it was fine but was drizzled in some yogurt which also had gone off. I tried my best and finished the rice and salad, but could not eat the meat it stank and was barley warm probably sitting there for the whole day, I went there at 9pm.
  I would  advise you to not go here for the sake of your health and hard earned dollars stay away.  I wish I had gone to A&W as I originally planned."}
{"text":"Ever since traveling thru Europe a few years ago, I've been looking for a place that serves good doner kebab. We have some great shawarma places in Toronto but I have yet to find a place that truly satisfies my craving. 

I noticed this place as I was driving past on Eglinton earlier today. Decided I'd give it a shot...so here I am, waiting for my order of Iskander Kebab. I asked what the difference is between this and a doner kebab (which judging from the signage is their main draw) and the guy behind the counter gave me a puzzled look and said 'the sauces'. More sauce the better for me, so I said I'd go for it. There are pictures of all the dishes on the wall but I couldn't really tell much from them other than some dishes have kebabs while others have meat shaved of 'turning thing'. 

The restaurant itself is nothing to write home about...small space but clean. A good sign (I hope) is the fact that it is pretty busy and most of the people seem like locals.

Okay, my meal just arrived so it's time to chow down. Looks reeeeaaaally saucey.

....that was quick...all done. So the verdict? 

Meh, ok. Under all the saucey meat was soggy pieces of bread...now it could be soggy because of my selection but regardless, I wasn't a fan of that. Huge scoop of yogurt served along side the food only added to the blandness of the meal. A little more kick is what this meal needs IMO. If you're the kind of person who likes to add ketchup to everything and have a low tolerance for spice, the iskender kebab is great...not so much for me. 

Would I come back? Sure I'd give it one more chance for something different."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST LAMB DONER I HAVE EVER HAD!! I'm a regular here by now! I want to try the pide and always plan on it but then get too tempted by the lamb doner. The kanefeh is one of the best in the city - I usually prefer a cake type but the crispy vermicelli is also good (you cannot finish this dessert on your own). Ask for Turkish tea - served for free!"}
{"text":"We went here with my family during summer and it was unbearably hot. There was no air conditioner what so ever and plus the space being very tight we were unable to enjoy our food. The customer service was poor and the server lady was a bit rude. Overall we were not happy and ate our food very fast so we could leave as soon as possible. I will never go there with my family again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing only if you order one of the following:

1. Beef/Lamb doner sandvich. $6.50
(Thin sliced rotisserie beef in their homemade pita-style sandwich bread stuffed with veggies and amazing sauce)

2. The chicken shish tavuk dinner.  $12
(Grilled pieces of chicken breast shish tawook, served with Turkish rice, salad and fresh made bread)

3. For dessert be sure to order their Kunefe.  ($6) Hard to explain, but it's baked to order cheese topped with verimecilli phylo dough baked in a syrup and comes out piping hot. It's amazing and a must try.  Turkish tea is always complimentary on dine in. 

Everything else sucks to be honest.

Stick to those and you'll be happy, full and glad you listened to me.
Deviate and you probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Shirin Kebab House is a casual neighbourhood diner in a strip mall. The ground beef Turkish pide is a cheeseless recipe, with a thin and light crust. The veal-and-lamb doner  was a tasty bundle of meat packed into a cylinder of pita. For drinks, we enjoyed the cherry and pomegranate sodas in the van. We didn't try the baklava, as I'm allergic to walnuts.

Tables and chairs are by the big window facing Eglinton. Families are comfortable bringing their children and toddlers. In the late afternoon, the turnover in clientele was relatively fast. During peak hours, take out would likely be more popular."}
{"text":"This place is joke unprofessional and they don't know anything about customer service or restaurant business i order 2 beef doner to go after waiting for 20 min and then they told me there's no more beef. I will not recommend this place to anyone"}
