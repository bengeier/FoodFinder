{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix! All of the food here is really good and inexpensive. I try to make it here a couple of times a month because it is so delicious."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I found for a great price with a fantastic selection. It looks a little run down but don't let that deceive you. I am definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced authentic Mexican food at a local mom and pop place. The lady taking my order was very friendly despite there seeming to be a slight language barrier. I ordered three street tacos, the pollo, asada, and carnitas and got them to go. The smell was intoxicating in my car during the drive, I had to fight the urge to eat at every stop light on the way to my destination. I wasn't disappointed once I was able to eat them either. Very flavorful, good quality meat, and expertly cooked. I would recommend to others and definitely return to explore more of their menu as a quick lunch go-to."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I have had in phoenix! I have had two friends that were born and raised in Mexico go there to test the place out and they both gave two thumbs up. The food reminded them of there grandma so it had to be delicious. Re-fried beans are amazing and so is the horchata."}
{"text":"Best cheap Mexican food in the valley! Found this place after the deli I wanted to go to next door was closed. 

Their gorditas are legit. They have every filling from chorizo with egg to classic carne asada. So simple and delicious with just lime and hot sauce. My girlfriend gets the taquitos supreme which is a deilcious gut bomb. I stick to the gorditas and sometimes throw in a white cheese quesadilla. 

If you are a gringo like me you might get some attitude but be nice and nice things happen. Norma is the short lady working behind the counter, be nice to her and see how fat those gorditas can be, mine come over flowing with carne!"}
{"text":"Great fast mexican food ! Good prices and the place looks clean as well as what I was able to see  of the kitchen which is a major plus! Happy to find this spot in this area it saves me the trips to the west side hunting for good mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place that serves gorditas and this place doesn't disappoint.  You can have them with just about anything you ask.    The tripas, cabeza and lengua are my fave.    They are so good.

This place also make the menudo just the way I like it.  Plenty of tripe,  spicy and hot and you can ask for toasted bread.   They do serve this everyday and not only on Sundays.  

Their rolled tacos supreme are good but the psuedo guac was unexpected.  The guacamole is a  \"watered-down\" version. 

The service can be rude at times if their's short woman behind the counter.   She usually works the morning shift.   The guy in the evening is always pleasant and in good spirits. 

The place is small but the food keeps me going back for more."}
{"text":"Gorditas El Tio is quick, Mexican takeout for the 85032 crowd.  And what a lucky ZIP code we are to have them!  At the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here.  Gorditas El Tio is all the classic dishes nestled into Styrofoam, bagged and ready in 20-30 mins.  Pretty standard.   

But compared to any ___berto's joint in the Valley, this place is exceptional.  I say it's the best of its kind.  There's no kowtowing to gringos here.  In fact, if English is your first language, you're likely to be the only one when you go in.  The food is as honest as their unabashed lack of English fluency.  Gorditas El Tio is the real deal at the right price.  If you're tired of dishes drowned in sour cream and mild cheddar cheese, then get here.  

Don't come here expecting the best Mexican food ever, but expect it to be far superior to its competitors."}
{"text":"Love the food!!! Reminds me of a hole in wall taqueria in California with authentic mexican food"}
{"text":"Food is not the best. Salsa is watered down. They barely put any guac or sour cream on the food. No Bueno."}
{"text":"Excellent juicy (not greasy) carne asada tacos. You know it's the real deal when it has only cilantro and onion! The salsas are also excellent"}
{"text":"The food here at Gorditas is absolutely amazing, kicking the competition to the ground. Situated in what I call the \"heart of Mexico\", the atmosphere isn't very welcoming nor are the workers. Upon ordering, I was not greeted and getting looks from both the workers and their customers as I am not of Mexican descent. But in the end, I'm only there for the food!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Gorditos El Tio so much we treat our employees to it regularly. Awesome fish tacos and authentic street food :)"}
{"text":"Not really a fan, would've given three stars but the attitude from the staff shot down the third one. 

My BF order four carne asada tacos and he ate all of them but said they weren't memorable. They had decent flavor but he had better from other nearby locations. He also commented on the lack of meat on a few of the tacos. 

I order a red chili burrito and the women rolled her eyes and repeated the order in Spanish which I said \"Yes, thank you\" to-  So I don't know if she was rolling her eyes because of my language choice or the order but it was just rude. 

Getting home I took a bite into the burrito excited for some red goodness to find it was a rice, bean, cheese and green chili burrito. After her repeating the order back to me in Spanish, I ended up with the wrong order. Very frustrating, the burrito was decent but not what I wanted and I stopped eating it half way through. 

The sauces they gave were tasty, but not going back and wasting my money on a restaurant that is rude and with only a handful of people in the restaurant they mess up orders. No thank you, I'll find another locally own restaurant to support."}
{"text":"omg. worst mexican \"food\" ever.

looking for a mexican food place on the way home from the cave creek area, we happened upon this place's relatively good reviews and decided to give it a shot. i ordered the chile relleno plate and my date ordered a chicken quesadilla. apparently the chicken quesadilla wasn't bad. but of my two chile rellenos, only one of them found it's way to the microwave, since the bottom was cold, and the cheese was hard. the beans were gray they had so much lard in them. this plate was hard to look at, let alone eat. i will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've tried authentic Mexican food from various locations in different cities. I was disappointed when the salsa roja was made purely from canned tomato sauce. Also, the chicken in my tacos was not seasoned. It tasted so regular. The Mexican rice has such low flavoring, it looks like white rice. There's better Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very authentic Mexican food. I am picky about my salsas & chili sauces and I was not disappointed. Will come again soon."}
{"text":"Killer carne asada torta. went there on a whim, glad I did"}
{"text":"This is the best & most authentic Mexican food in this area!  I ordered a sope of Chile verde, gordita made of lengua, taco de tripitas.  It was the best & freshest!  Daughter ordered kids meal of 2 tacos & was a good size plate!  She loved it too!"}
{"text":"Realmente la comida no es fresca mucho menos sabrosa y el trato nada grato definitivamente no regreso, tampoco recomiendo el lugar!"}
{"text":"This place is Authentic, if your looking for tex mex this isn't it.  You can feel and tell the place is authentic if the majority of the customers are from the country the restaurant claims to serve food from!  Everything is fresh and the food is prepared by a couple of \"Real Senoras\" in the back; that posses the real Sazon of Real Mexican Food!.  Highly recommend the sopes and Enchiladas in Salsa Roja sauce!!!  Also the Menudo is Excellent, tacos are awesome, try the Tripitas mmm!  You wont get this Authentic experience in any Filibertos, taco bell, or any of the other pretenders!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I used to drive to Tucson to enjoy delicious tacos and other Mexican affairs. For a fast for mexican joint, like a filbertos, the food is amazing fresh. I'm not 100% sure but the gorditas and tortillas are home made. I'm going to keep this review short. Go get the cabeza and lingua gorditas, now."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try for dinner last night since they were the only place that had sopes! Ordered to go, 5 rolled supreme tacos and two chicken sopes! My rolled tacos were one of the best ones I've ever had. They were hot, crunchy, and they were topped off with lettuce, guacamole, and cheese! It had the perfect flavor and they felt home cooked! My husband also enjoyed his sopes and said they tasted really good. I will definitely be back since they have such a huge menu of items to pick from!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here but priced right and very delish. The menu was quite extensive with pictures for those of us that don't know a whole lot of Spanish.  Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! This was my husband & my first time here based on the great reviews on yelp we read and we were very pleased. . Our standards for mexican food / taco shops are high & this place definitely met that. 
We had combo plates and they were fantastic! Food is authentic and priced fairly! A definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"Very nasty carne asada served here in Mexico, Phoenix. The Mexican speaking cashier had to be substituted for an English speaking person midway through our order. This is not Trump country. Upon arrival home with carne asada burrito, I took three small bites before noticing an avalanche of fatty pieces and grizzle. It was pretty standard stuff for these type of places, so I actually took a major leap of faith, but was wrong. The carne ended up dumped out in the trash soon after that third bite. One white businessman was inside during lunch amongst a throng of Mexicans who apparently love fatty, grisly carne asada burritos."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time! Authentic delicious Mexican food. I almost gave this place 5 stars but sometimes the wait for my order can take awhile. Hubby likes their menudo a lot."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Always get the same thing for my husband when kids and I have eaten already. I bring him the mojarra frita and it's always been consistently delicious. People are friendly too."}
{"text":"It takes 32 minutes.

(The time needed to get from SW baggage claim to the curbside pick-up to the highway to the very first stop on my every trip to Phoenix - authentic Mexican food at Alberto's....I mean, El Tio....same diff...and good at any location. They'll tell you they're different and that there is some type of territorial feud going on between the two locally-operated chains. But, don't believe the hype....they just like to give you reason to keep jumping back and forth between both their great menus! Go for the burritos, stay for the chips with pseudo-guac and homemade salsas!)"}
{"text":"Me encanta la comida! Muy bueno experiencia cada vez que voy. Me encantan las tostadas de ceviche y las flautas.

Love the food! Always have a great experience there! Love getting the shrimp ceviche tostadas there and the flautas!"}
{"text":"Stop by on a Friday afternoon, not busy at all. Had flauta plate, beans tasted awful, the flautas were okay. Liked the toppings, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole but not enough meat in the flautas."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. Pretty much same menu as Filbertos but the food tastes better. And they are also cheaper, can't beat that."}
{"text":"Okay, after my less than stellar review of Barrio Cafe, I felt the need to redeem my Mexican food review status.

Gorditas El Tio is awesome. The food is good, authentic and very inexpensive. Growing up in Texas with a grandmother that lived on the Texas/New Mexico border our family takes its Mexican food quite seriously.  GET is the real deal. 

Okay, their salsa could be a little better, but who cares when their gorditas and burritos are as good as they are."}
{"text":"The Gorditas are delicious! Tried out the Liquado de  mango so yummy! The tacos de carne asada were yummy too! Fresas con crema is ok"}
{"text":"We went here for early dinner after movies on a Saturday.
I picked this place because I wanted Menudo (it is a huge bowl for less than $6)
Hubby got the carne asada fries, and he liked them. Huge mountain of fries topped with carne asada, cheese, guacamole and sour cream.
Daughter had shrimp cocktail and cheese cake.
Shrimp cocktail was very good (I didn't taste it but she did like it a lot) and the cheesecake we all shared and it was so so... it was sweet, caramel like flavor, so all and all it was a nice dessert, but not much ofthe cheesecake flavor and consistency that we were expecting.

We will definitely be back, especially since I found this place looking for tripitas (I have not found many places that serve tripitas)

However, the few times we have been there it has been a tad warm... so as the temperatures increase we will probably be ordering to go.

Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food!
WAY better than insertanynamehere-bertos!
My go-to place for Mexican."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try out this Taco shop since I don't live nearby.  When I walked into the restaurant, I thought I would have an awesome meal...but it turned out to be mediocre.  Here's what I ordered:

Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $3.10
Carne Asada Taco, $1.33

The BRC Burrito was ok....the Beans didn't taste fresh.  The Carne Asada Taco was pretty good, but didn't have that \"addictive flavor\" to it.  

I love Mexican Food and judge restaurants by asking this simple question...\"Will I get the urge to drive a long distance (15+ min) to eat there?\".....in this case, the answer was \"no\".

{"text":"If I was a business owner I would correct everything wrong with this place. Let me start with the following. The hours on Google state 12:00 AM, which is fine if that is the time they close. We get to the location at 10:15ish (give or take) Lets just give them the benefit of a doubt and say 10:45 PM. The cashier stated that we can only order take out and that her credit card machine was not working. I know for a fact that means she closed up shop early and is only excepting cash only. this is every inconvenient. So at this point, all of this is customer service and if I was the owner I would like to know what is going on in my bread and butter (Money/Income/Livelihood) If this is how the front people are treating the customers I cant even imagine how the people handling the food are doing or thinking. I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN FIRST AND LAST."}
{"text":"Great little shop...I had 2 gorditas one of chile verde which was more sweet then spicy & one of lengua which was quite fantastic...they were 2.50$ & about the size of a pupusa  I did enjoy them so if you're ever in the neighbourhood I suggest you try it out !"}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican food you could possibly find! My total came out to 10.10. Order 3 street tacos which comes with two sides and an order of Mexican soda.  The food was good, but they are really rude as if they don't value your business and speak to you rudely when you are ordering your food. It sucks that the customer service was awful because the food was great. I'm pretty sure they were rude because I didn't look Mexican, she was sure surprised when I responded back in Spanish. I don't plan on returning until they train their employees. 
******Warning: Spanish Speakers******
When I went to go order  they spoke ONLY Spanish which caught me off guard. Luckily for me I'm fluent. If you plan on coming here bring a friend who speaks Spanish!  




te habla groseramente como si ni siquiera quieren a tu negocio. Hay más restaurantes mexicanos que yo preferiría ir a donde tratan a sus clientes con respeto."}
{"text":"I like this place. Huge menu, everything I've had has been good and the price is right.

Ok, I gotta qualify this...I haven't really gotten past the Rolled Tacos Supreme. It's just too good. Five taquitos blanketed in guacamole, lettuce, crema. cotija cheese and ganished with chopped carne asada....I want to try the rest of the menu, I really do, but when I get to the head of the line something takes over my vocal cords and I hear those three little words come out, again. J. likes the Nachos which is similar in ingredients to my fav with more carne asada and beans and he has had the fish tacos which he thought were very satisfactory.

Even though I've been able to resist so far, they have a good selection of Jarritos. Unfortunately the Jarritos Piña goes straight to my hips (like the entrees are calorie free???) so I prefer water or Ice Tea with my meals, but they are lovely to look at in the chiller next to the register.

This little taco shack has all the elements of a cheap Mexican delight. Variety, Flavor and good value for your buck. Look for me when you try it out, I'll probably be there ;-)"}
{"text":"They have the BEST champurrado and fresas con crema in town! The champurrado is seasonal, but damn it's delicious every time!"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good! We ordered the shrimp salad, chimichanga, chicken flautist and caldo de res. The beef in the caldo was a HUGE piece but I wish they cut it up a little. No complaints other than that really. The rice and beans were OK, nothing to write home about. Staff only talked to us in Spanish. Restaurant was nice and clean."}
{"text":"It is hard to believe five  Mexican fast food places could exist on 32nd St. & Greenway.  Food City has a place inside, Filiberto's, Los Betos,and here. ( there is one more that I can't think of..)
Anyway, I have been going to this place for a few years now.  While the staff is not the friendliest, nor have they been necessarily unfriendly, the food has always been good. Usually hit this place with my cousin for breakfast.  About two weeks ago I had their tripitas burrrito.  I crave that sucker now.  I think I dreamt about it the other night.The tripas are loaded with diced and perfectly crisped tripas( mouth is watering...) If you go, try something a little different.  The \"scrap\" meats that are common in Mexican family fare are pretty darn tasty.  'Course the \"interesting\" meat cuts sound a lot fancier when ordered in  French restaurant, but go for a truly tasty lengua, cabeza, or tripitas burrito!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Sunday around 3pm for a late lunch...place was packed!  Nice to see...had Sopes e Carnitas, Shrimp Cocktail and a Torta Milanesa....

Sopes and Shrimp Cocktail were great!  The Torta, not so much..bread was old, the fried steak was too thin and tasted old...it was edible...so Tortas are not their strong point."}
{"text":"On the corner of 32nd street and Greenway there are 4 down and dirty Mexican places.  The ubiquitous Taco Bell.....Los Beto's, where a cop shot and killed some guy a few weeks back.....one of those 'berto places, can't remember if it's Fili or Eri.  But tucked behind the McDonald's, around the corner from the testosterone laden Krav Maga studio (there are always like 3 Hummers in front of this place) lies Gorditas El Tio.  The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because they use the weird, not quite real guacamole.  I just avoid that.  I love love love their green chile burro.....Great tortilla, meat inside just delish.  I also love the carne asada, tongue and Carnitas burritos.  But the Chile Verde is king.  A previous review dissed the beans for being gray from too much lard.  Honey, those frijoles are someone's Abuela's recipe and are dead on authentic. Their hot sauce is fantastic and will totally clear out your sinuses it packs such a punch.  They have my beloved Mexican Coke and the best array of Jarrito's soda  I've seen.  It's a bit warm in there and you have to wait awhile for take out, but you can always entertain yourself by watching a Mexican music video channel with beautiful, heavily made up ladies and men in cowboy hats singing mostly about getting their hearts broken....at least from what I can gather."}
{"text":"This place is always busy around breakfast time.. They make huge breakfast burritos so bring an appetite.

I stopped by after 12:00 today and the place was empty .. Ordered the giant Jamaica and the chile verde (pork) combo with corn tortillas.. the pork was good but was swimming in way too much chile verde.. Rice and beans were your standard sides.. The corn tortillas though were like store bought steamed or warmed in a microwave .. No good because they get hard before you're half way done with your food."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible doesn't look nothing like #8! Disappointed and all prices went up a dollar too.. The rice was less than half a cup and meat was nothing like the picture."}
{"text":"This is the closest I have gotten to my grandmas Mexican food cooking! I usually order the shrimp cocktail I've had better but, it defiantly satisfy's the craving I would rate the shrimp cocktail a 3.5 it does have plenty of shrimp the only thing is the avocado, cucumber, and onions are cut up like random small, medium, and large pieces. Also carne asada quesadilla and carne asada fries are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations based on the other reviews. While the food here is good, it does not exceed other places like this in the area. The inside is clean and staff very helpful. Try something new or go for a classic the food is very good."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, we used to go here all the time. Every single time, they were rude to us, but it was worth it for the delicious chicken gorditas. However, the final straw was when we found a toothpick in our taquito. No, I dont mean it was poking out, I mean it was wrapped in the tortilla inside with the chicken. My sis BIT into it. That same time, I chomped something hard, it was a big piece of gravel. In my chicken gordita. Ok, we're gringas, but I used to work in Mexico and speak some spanish. I am used to anti-gringo attitudes, I used to get called all sorts of names walking around. However, this place is the WORST I have ever experienced, especially here in the states, and I truly believe, to this day, it was because we are gringas. Gravel doesnt just \"accidentally\" get into chicken. Nor does a toothpick get fried into a taquito. I havent returned. I will always miss their gorditas."}
{"text":"If you're an English only sort of person, Gorditas El Tio is probably not for you. For me, this most recent visit was an opportunity to bone up on my Spanish by watching a Spanish language version of Peoples Court on their television. Something about $2,000 in damages and a woman wronged. Guess it's back to Rosetta Stone for me.

The menu board is in Spanish, with some English. The frequent visitor punch cards (buy five combo plates, get one free) have one side in Spanish and one in English. The television is tuned into a Spanish language channel. And your order will be likely be taken by a person for whom English is clearly a second language. In other words, perfect! It's a Mexican restaurant for heavens sake! 

You order at the counter and they call out when your food is ready. Language is really not an issue. You'll have twenty, yes twenty, value combinations from which to choose. Don't be worried when you see no salsa bar and only ketchup and pepper sauce on the tables. You'll receive bottles of serviceable red and green sauce when your food is ready. I do wish they had the beverage machine in front of the counter instead of in back. Oh well. Not a big thing. The menu is extensive and the food is solid. The $1.35 mini tacos, for example, are quite generous. They also have a $3.99 menu para ninos. 

The décor is very basic. A taco shop sort of vibe, but with a much more complete menu. Service is not ultra fast, but your food will be hot and fresh when delivered to you."}
{"text":"Just Wow! 5 stars for the food. This place has EXCELLENT food! I'll be coming back! Great alternative to Filibertos and is unfortunately hidden away, I'm glad I noticed it!"}
{"text":"As a fellow Mexican I love this place. Been going there for over a decade now. If i ever want authentic Mexican food with a variety this is my go to place."}
