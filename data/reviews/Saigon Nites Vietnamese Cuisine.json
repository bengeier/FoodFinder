{"text":"You know that you have a serious problem when the staff expresses sincere concern when you order something other than your regular dish (#24)!!  I honestly don't know how to rate this place high enough and as I've been eating here for the last decade I realize that I feel ashamed that I havent written  a review sooner. I think I secretly wanted to keep this place for myself.  Well,  that ain't happening!   Let me start by saying you will not find a better bowl of Pho or Bun anywhere else.  When I say anywhere, I mean the continental United States and beyond.  I frequently travel all over including to Asia.  The flavors are so dynamic and subtle, in a word delicious!  It makes every other bowl of Pho taste like salted water.  This is my #1 place for  Vietnamese food and no one,  I mean no one can touch their Pho.  Phogetaboutit!!!    The meat is tender and always cooked to perfection.  Yes,  I just used the word always.  Please read my other reviews to see how brutally honest I can be with lesser fare.  The noodles always perfectly textured.   The rice is to die for and all the dishes we have had here are wonderful. (Shaken beef,  Pho,  Bun,  fried calamari, egg rolls are heaven.)   Service is excellent and if you come frequently they will make you feel like family.    My vote for #1 Vietnamese restaurant on THE PLANET!!   If this place ever closed I would become suicidal."}
{"text":"I'm only at 3 stars on this one, but I'll be going back to see if it improves.   Recently I popped in here to meet two friends who are big fans of this restaurant.  There are things to love, certainly, but it's not as good as some other Vietnamese restaurants in the Mesa/Gilbert/Chandler area.    Here are my impressions for my initial visit:  Clean and friendly, this is always important.  Service was only so-so with my lunch coming quite awhile in advance of the others.  I ordered the sugar cane shrimp with vermicelli noodles (lunch special).  This is a kind of pink day-glo meatball thing stuck on a bit of sugar cane.  Strange.  It came on a bed of vermicelli noodles with some shredded lettuce but without the promised cucumber.  Served with the usual daikon/carrot dressing.  Bit of a rip off for $6.95.   One companion had the chicken with fried rice (she had ordered orange chicken - it was definitely orange-colored but not orange-flavored).  It must have been some sort of dwarf chicken or had shrunk in the frying process. She picked at it without finishing very much of it.  The other friend had the beef pho (ordered without the tripe, nicely omitted by request).  He dumped quite a few hot pepper flakes into it and declared it delicious (we took turns mopping his brow).  It certainly looked tasty.  So a mixed success this time.  I'll definitely try again, it seems to be the only Asian restaurant in the area and certainly worth a second chance.  Update coming..."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I ordered some egg rolls and the vermicelli with chicken and shrimps.  I was very disappointed how the egg rolls tasted like. I was eating fried flour, and the grilled chicken was so dry. I would not go back there because I feel like they were too stingy with the meat portion."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. My coworker and I went to this place for lunch today and we found a hair in my pho AND in her pho. I have dark brown hair so when I first found the hair in my pho I thought maybe it was mine? Sure, it ruined my appetite but I wasn't 100% sure that the hair wasn't mine so I didn't want to make it a big deal and didn't say anything to the staff about it but then 15 min after I found the hair in my pho, my coworker (who has short blond hair) also found a long dark brown hair in hers as well so that's when we decided to mention in to the staff but the way they handled the situation was extremely unprofessional. I mentioned it to one of the servers and he just rolled his eyes and said that we didn't have to worry about the bill (I think he might have assumed that we were just making this up or trying to get free food). We also talked to who we believe is the food runner and it looked like he was at a loss for words because he didn't say a single word and just walked back to the kitchen. Neither of them bothered to apologize and/or to make the situation right, but instead rushed us to get out of there.   Before this post, I actually didn't have a Yelp account but because of the way that they chose to handle this situation, I felt like I had to create an account to share this terrible experience with you all and to make you all aware that this place isn't as sanitary as you would like it to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here.  We have had the Pho, lemongrass chicken, spring rolls and all were excellent.  Service is fast and courteous. Only downside is it is located in a nondescript strip mall and decor could use an update."}
{"text":"I am a pho fan and theirs is more than fair! Flavorful spring rolls with peanut sauce, tender orange chicken, and a delicious house-made coconut water! Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Disgusting kitchen infested with roaches! Don't eat here! Dirty disgusting food!  I will never eat here again.  There was a bug in my soup and the woman owner yelled at me and claimed I put it there in order to get a refund. Wow, I must enjoy keeping bugs in my purse just to get free food. Needless to say, she didn't offer to remake food or refund.  I paid and walked out."}
{"text":"I've eaten A LOT of Pho around the country and have never had better.  It's the only thing I've tried here, but with soup that good, why try anything else.  The owners will also customize your soup as per request.  My wife loves the Pho and is a fan of the lemongrass tofu EXTRA SPICY!  The spring rolls are amazing.  Again, the best I've had."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get the Vietnamese Sandwich because im a huge fan of it. Ordered the grilled chicken one. Amazing! Good amount of meat, veggies and warm the way it should be, One of the best ive had. I will be stopping by to get the Pho though one day soon, Loved the sandwich though!"}
{"text":"casual, family-style, delicious Vietnamese food! 4/5  Saigon Nites is one of our regular restaurants in the Valley. We love its pho (all kind), house fried rice and recently addicted to its chicken wings! Yes, chicken wings in brown, spicy Asian sauce. A good place for a bowl of soupy, home-style pho!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem with excellent pho!  It's hard to find good pho in the scottsdale area and this place is great!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from temecula and was looking for a good hot bowl of pho. I decided to stop in SN. I stood at the counter for about five minutes not knowing if i had to wait to be seated or just pick a table? I was rudely greeted by the onwer asking \" what you want \" i asked for a table . He sat me down . I had to ask for the table to be wiped down as the last party had left it a little messy. I placed my order for a bowl of pho. It took 15 minutes for me to get my order ( what seemed like for ever ) I thought i was on a Seinfeld episode so i did not  say anything as i did not want to hear him yell at me \" NO SOUP FOR YOU \" . When i finally got my beef pho i thought i was in heaven ( it was totally worth the wait and abuse ) you take as long as you want soup Nazi as i will quietly sit here waiting for my delicious pho"}
{"text":"We went to this place with my family and I was so disappointed because the food is not even close to what the other yelp people were saying. If you don't know Vietnamese food maybe it's good. Price was too high and the portion was small. I ordered the combination platter and some of the portion in the menu is missing. I ask the owner or manager and he told me \"oh we don't served that anymore\".  If you don't serve that anymore take it out from the menu. But I paid for that portion because it's suppose to be included in the combination platter. Wife ordered the pho special and some portion mentioned in the menu was missing too. Grilled chicken come on!!! you  boiled the chicken and you put some char on it and you called it grilled. Smell the food you ordered from this joint like my grilled chicken was old maybe left over from yesterday. Wow, what a waste of money I spent at this place. The server is creepy and doesn't understand what we're saying. The soup is too sweet my wife only had few sips. Also, my sister ordered an egg roll and received a spring roll. They don't want to take the order back anymore so she just have to eat it.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Agree with one of the post earlier that it is probably the best Pho in the N.Scottsdale area .... (as my friend said, there are just not many authentic Asian restaurant in this area)  But in comparison to some real good Pho I had before, it is not much to wave about ... the broth is good but not great.  I also had the vermicelli, it is a ok.  The quantity is much smaller and the price run on the higher side than most of the Vietnamese place I have been to.  But given the location and the rent in this area, I think it is justified.    The place is clean and service is good. Obviously a family run business with a very homey feeling to it. Another quick fix for my Asian crave ...   Recommended for quick Pho fix"}
{"text":"Good inexpensive ethnic food in North Scottsdale is such a rarity and Saigon Nites is just that.    It's located in the Scottsdale Airpark area in the same center as Indian Paradise.  The room is relatively nice, service is friendly, prices are very reasonable and most shocking of all, the food is authentic and very good - it's almost too good to be true.  We had the special pho (rice noodles in beef broth with thin-sliced beef, tripe and meatballs) and banh xeo (giant crepe filled with a mix of meat and beansprouts).  The pho's broth was sweet, clean and complex - tasted like it was made with a generous amount of beef bones cooked for a long time over low heat - no hint of any artificial flavoring.  It was so good that I finished all the soup - that's never happened at Da Vang.    The banh xeo comprised of a large crepe made with rice flour filled with beansprouts, pork, shrimp and herbs.  It's served with leaves of iceberg lettuce and the classic nuoc cham dipping sauce.  This is probably one of the best-executed banh xeo I've had - the crepe was very thin and crispy.  The filling was on the bland side but the dipping sauce made up for it.  We can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu, including the banh mi (Vietnamese-French sandwiches)."}
{"text":"What I ate here:  - Fried rice: great portion and very good! - Spring rolls: NOT GOOD - Tapioca: was more like a dessert smoothie? It was good, but I would like something that I could have with my meal  I would come back here, but it would need to be amazing for me to return again for a second time!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites. A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience. The Steak Pho is amazing. Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces, chili oil, etc...not at Saigon! Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen. Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"As a Vietnamese I would say that it is semi-authentic (tailored for average American but close enough for a Vietnamese). The spring roll is quite good with fish source dip--you have to request this because average American again doesn't know better. Pho is good though a bit salty for my taste. Other than the noodle being slightly under cook which makes it a bit chewy, it was worth the price. Definitely a better Vietnamese restaurant than most that I've been to."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Hayden south of Northsight you will find really great Pho. I usually make it here once a week to support my Pho addiction. The chicken Pho is my favorite, but the beef is good as well.  The soup does not come spicy, but a couple spoon fulls of red pepper sauce can fix that in a hurry. Don't forget the basil, limes, and jalapenos. Quench your hot food hole with yummy Thai iced tea. Pho is cheap too. 6.95 for a huge bowl of deliciousness. Appetizers? maybe some edamame, but why waste food space on other stuff. Attentive staff when not super busy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. Real, authentic food, generous portions. A must try when in the area."}
{"text":"Bumped into this place.  Very glad we stopped by.  Food was delicious, great customer service, very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the Special Pho with a co-worker. It was very good. The fresh vegetables made the dish. The broth was rich and wonderful. It was a great lunch."}
{"text":"Always come here for the food but our service was poor at best, waiting 20min to be seated, then once seated we had to ask the server 30min later to place an order in. We noticed he didn't even bring the order in the back. Ended up leaving after 50min of waiting total with no order in and no food still."}
{"text":"First time we came here and the place so clean and also we order the Pho was good definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service..great place to eat. Pho is very tasty. Spring rolls are the bomb. Great local place to eat."}
{"text":"Saigon Nites is a decent addition to the Phoenix-area Pho options.  Standard fare including pho, vermicelli noodle dishes, and rice dishes.  The pho comes in a good sized bowl, though I would say somewhat light on the noodles.  The broth is usually the best part of any pho, and this flavorful.  It has a tinge of sweetness, which I found to be slightly unusual but not too distracting.  Also had the fried rice, which was pretty good.  Unlike other reviewers' comments, we actually found the service to be slow for a pho restaurant (which are usual near instantaneous).  The price was also higher than I'm accustomed to for pho.  Would I go back?  Probably. If I'm in the mood for pho, options are light in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was excited to find this little restaurant 5mins from home and had wished it could be better so I can come often, but I was rather disappointed on the price and the amount of food it was offered.   I had the grilled chicken rice vermicelli, and friend had the shrimp pad Thai with a small bowl of shrimp wonton soup, and a coke, total bill came to be $28 without tip. Really???... The flavor of the food is decent and I liked the little sweetness of the grilled chicken,however, I have to agree with other yelpers, portion is just small! Guess it won't be a regular cheap and quick run anymore....."}
{"text":"Nice family run restaurant. Fresh ingredients well prepared.  Love the spring rolls - loaded with fresh herbs and shrimp. Pho - well done. Good noodle dishes and most entrees shine as well.  I prefer this place for lunch or carryout, it is very quiet at dinner time, food is still very good - but the overall ambiance is somewhat depressing."}
{"text":"Warning for non-white customers!!!!  This Vietnamese restaurant is VERY bias in picking and choosing who will get service first even if you arrive and sit down before another party.  The restaurant owner lady give all the attention to her white customers first before other colored people.  We have noticed this for many months and years and to point that we want to share this with other customers.  They need to change their way of practice in serving customers."}
{"text":"Came in with our two kids, people came in after us and got 2 rounds of drinks served before we even got acknowledged.  We left with out ever being spoken to.  plus its always 85 degrees in there.  We didn't have time to wait around, so we went to a new sushi joint on Shea instead.  Been here many times, food OK and most importantly its close to where we live, our fav stuff is downtown and in the avenues.  Back to Pho Thanh for us."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure dining at Saigon Nites. The service is fast and friendly, and the pho is the best you can find in the Scottsdale area (beats driving down to Tempe or Mesa for a good bowl of pho). Be sure to try the shrimp spring rolls, they're a fresh and tasty appetizer before your soup."}
{"text":"Hands down consistently the best pho I've ever had. Also one of the cleanest and best priced Vietnamese restaurants I've been in. No frills just great food."}
{"text":"I just have two words... Pho Phriday  The boys from the office and I have been coming here for a couple years now... every Phriday... we get a diet Pepsi and the chicken pho with extra noodles (add $1).   If they didn't have Scottsdale rent, the pho might be a dollar or two less, but gall-dangit I can get good pho in Scottsdale and I don't give a shank about the price!!!  I don't even need a menu any more. You might want to try something else, but if you need a pho phix - and you know who you are - stop in, seat yourself, and get into some love...   \"I'll take the pho, extra noodles, diet pepsi.\"   Snap.  PS have a pressed coffee if you feel sassy."}
{"text":"If you like Asian food this is the place you wanna go. To bad the location is so bad because in any other spot this place would be poppin"}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had. Best pot stickers I've ever had. Almost the best taro boba I've ever had. Enough said."}
{"text":"It's tricky finding pho with tasty broth lately.This place has great broth and noodles.Service was also very nice."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch. Broth was great, had the \"Pho Ga\". Noodles could have been alittle more cooked. Service was friendly and fast. Overall experience was great. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Waited for 30 mins only to watch them clean tables. We asked the 4 times to take out order and they took the people's order that came in after us. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails. WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place. It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland, CA. The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly. We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I usually go there for the Pho, I have had all of there flavors.  From there specials, shrimp, steak and chicken they are all very good.  Please check it out if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today...hummm. the service was poor, they never once refilled the drinks (water and Iced tea), they never cleared the plates, they advised us to order a dish that was the opposite of what we asked for. I wanted shrimp with vegetables, and the waiter assured me that the Shrimp Pho would be just that! I received a bowl of noodles with 3 small shrimp. I tried to enjoy this, and after 10 minutes of waiting for a follow up (ie:how is your meal?) I asked for some veggies to add to the boring dish. The waiter never returned....until he took our money. And, he said that the next time, it would be an extra charge for veggies. Hummmmm...$10 for broth and basic noodles (and 3 small shrimp)  I would not return to this restaurant. Very poor service and meal."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food! I went here with 3 others, we all loved it! I had the bahn xeo and it was delicious. We are totally going back here."}
{"text":"Tried Saigon for the first time on 3/30/17 and I will be back!  Ordered the Spring Rolls (qty 4) so fresh, the peanut sauce they were served with was super tasty!  Also ordered the Steak and Meatball Pho, the steak was sliced thinly, meatballs were quarter to bite size pieces. Everything was fresh and delish! Portion of the Pho was enough to have leftovers for lunch today, SO YUMMY!     Walked in and seated right away, once our food was ordered it was delivered in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"I love this place. The special pho is about as perfect and fresh as you can get. The Banh Xeo is always crisp and full of flavor. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow, I haven't ever had Vietnamese food that wasn't at the least ok. With enough sriracha, sambal, and fish sauce, you make just about anything taste good enough to eat. Unfortunately, all the sauces, garnishes, and prayers couldn't help me at Saigon Nites. It's not so much that it's flavorless food here, it's just funky.I couldn't tell if my pho was rancid, but it tasted that way. The appetizer sampler platter was nothing but \"from the box\" frozen selections most likely created by some giant corporation in Nebraska and intended for the frozen food section at your local grocery store. On a positive note however, my tab for soup and frozen \"delicacies\" only dented my cash roll 52 bucks....WTF???"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the crepe dish, and they do the best job with their bean sprouts of places I've tried so far."}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ, we've been looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant and Saigon Nites is pretty dang good!!  Very happy to have found this place & I'd recommend checking it out!  This place is a little out of the way in the sense that there isn't really anything else around it that we would go to. But we will definitely make the effort to go here again!  Friendly welcome and although our waiter seemed a little young & inexperienced, he was very friendly & when he didn't have answers for us, he found someone who did. (I asked about menu items & substituting, etc.)  The lady who came out to find out specifically what I was asking for was very helpful.  The food here is really fresh & tasty. Flavors really hit the spot!   We will be back for more! And I would recommend others to try this place as well!"}
{"text":"The best pho in Arizona!!!! I said that on a previous review for another restaurant before we tried the pho here. I get the steak pho with meatballs and we also share the spring rolls. Service is amazing! Everything comes out super fast & everyone is so friendly."}
{"text":"Their Pho doesn't have a lot of flavor, shaking beef tastes like it could have come from Panda Express and the rice wrapper on the spring rolls was very hard as if it were just sitting out for hours. Service was okay, we were sat right away and our server was pleasant. I don't know if I would give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Best Pho ever! My favorite is the soup with rice noodles, chicken, fish balls & shrimp. Comfort food at its best. I love this place since I don't know of any other Vietnamese soup joint as good as this, in Scottsdale or phoenix."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the fresh ingredients and wonderful flavors for tonight's meal Starting with calamari and then having shrimp soup and the shrimp and vegetable dish. We will definitely come back here more to try the other items as well."}
{"text":"No star if possible for service, food is a five star.. came in ordered food, started eating & I got a bossiness call. So didn't want to be rude I stepped outside at this point I have barely touched my food and, I have the guy come outside asked me to pay for my meal I said I tried telling you I was going to be back I'm on the phone on a business call I was coming right back in I let him know..Point being I came back in to sit back down after my call & he informs me that he threw my food away and to pay them a full amount. This point I'm upset and I walk away didn't have to pay but it was a terrible experience the way it was handled now am not describing it to the fullest but you get the idea :/"}
{"text":"I've been eating or getting takeout from this place for many years.  I've always been satisfied with the orders, lots of flavor.  The service has always been good.  I especially like the Shaken Beef, Lemongrass Chicken and the Chicken Pho.  Also the Spring rolls are good and they are not stingy with the shrimp in them.  I'm glad they are 5 minutes away.  It is also nice to support a family owned restaurant.  If someone wants to go for dinner last minute during busy season, this is a good standby as they will always have a table to accommodate you."}
{"text":"I eat a LOT of pho, it's one of my favorite foods... and in the North Scottsdale area, there isn't any better pho available. I like the pho here not just for the broth, but for the fact that they leave in all the good stuff (the tripe and the tendons) that the other nearby pho place leaves out.  Saigon Nites is GREAT. I come here pretty regularly since I found it, particularly for the special pho, but there are plenty of other great dishes available. My other favorite standby is a dish called Shaken Beef, which consists of beef strips served sizzling, fajita-style, along with onions, green peppers and string beans... SO GOOD! The spring rolls are great, and a good friend of mine swears by their curry, in fact he says it's the best in the area.  They can get kind of busy so the kitchen gets backed up around lunch time, and the prices are a little high, but it fits in with the area so that isn't really a issue."}
{"text":"First let me say ive had Pho in many many places, when the lady at the counter said \" they say we have the best Pho in town\" she wasnt kidding!! The food was amazing, lots of flavor and well put together... price was good , the people were friendly and the food came out fast..  Take out order: Shrimp Pho, Salted Shrimp & Crispy Calamari...  Bravo Saigon Nites! I'll be back often.. if I weren't sick I would have dined in, the atmosphere looked comfy.."}
{"text":"Had a craving for some good pho so I thought I'd give this place a try.  We ordered the steak pho and grilled chicken rice vermicelli noodles.  The pho was average, broth was fine, decent amount of meat, but the rice noodles were undercooked.  The vermicelli dish was pretty bad.  Mainly the grilled chicken they used which didn't resemble vietnamese grilled chicken but rather chicken from the Samurai Sam's next door."}
{"text":"Hit up Saigon Nites for lunch today with a coworker. I got the Pho chicken and he got the curry chicken - both were good. The pho was decent! Im from OC -Ca where I lived in literally Little Saigon. So, consider this review GOOD. I would give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Great pho and egg rolls! Service was quick and food was hot and flavorful. Prices are decent too. Waitstaff are very friendly. Will definitely be back! Best pho in town!"}
{"text":"We have added this place to the normal rounds for lunch.  That's a big thing... If we are in the mood for 'soup\"... easy choice... I've ordered a variety of dishes here and they don't disappoint.  Beef Stew with the red broth...very good.  My fave.  The fresh spring rolls are minty and flavorful.  All in all... I like."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place as it's 5 minutes away and would have been nice to have a place this close to go to for my Vietnamese fix 3-5 times a week.   It wasn't meant to be though.  The food here is at best, average but closer to bland.  Had the PHO with Steak and meatballs and an order of Vegetarian Summer Rolls.  There was no option to get Brisket as a choice.  PHO portion was very small, especially for the price $7.99.  Barely any noodles in it.  The broth was also a little too sweet.   I finished the entire bowl and all of the soup because I was really hungry, and wasn't completely full after that, a first of PHO.  The summer rolls (spring rolls) didn't actually come with any protein so we asked them to put some steamed Tofu too.  15 minutes later (not an exaggeration), we got the summer rolls with the pre-fried tofu that comes pre made in packs.  They also didn't include any of the normal vegetable filling that was suppose to come with it.  So basically rice paper, rice noddles (but not the thin vermicelli noddles) that were a little too thick, and lettuce / mint.  We had to wait another 10 minutes to get that.  When we got the bill. that's when we noticed they charged us extra for the tofu, with no mention of that before.  So basically it cost $20 with tip to get 1 small bowl of Pho and one order of vegetarian summer rolls.  Well be skipping this eating option, thankfully there are a lot of options around here.  If the prices were reasonable, this place would be a 3 star  place, but for the price premium, not worth it.  If I'm desperate for Vietnamese right away, I might go here for a fix, but that would be about it.  On the bright side, the staff / front of the house was really friendly and cheerful, which is why this place is 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with this store, i do NOT recommend ever giving this establishment your money.   I was (am) sick with a cold and had my boyfriend stop on his way  home during his lunch hour to pick up some Chicken Pho for me.  Well I was not surprised when he told me they were extremely busy and that this would no longer be an option.  I got frustrated and decided to call in an order for pickup myself.  I called and spoke with a man who seemed pleasant enough.  Placed my order and he said 10-15 minutes until it would be ready.  Fair enough.  My boyfriend gets back and being as sick as I was, urged that I did not pick it up and instead suggested we change the order to delivery.   I plead against this because I didnt want to have to pay for a delivery charge when htis place is literally 3  minutes away but before I knew it he was on the ph one with them trying to change the order to delivery.   Next thing that they said:  We don't deliver.  Even though on their front door it clearly states \"We Deliver\" and also on their website.  The employee my boyfriend was speaking with even got an attitude (how is a merchant going to give a paying customer attitude?) and started arguing with him while my boyfriend was simply asking why their \"delivery\" advertisement was still up on their front window.  This is just false advertisement if you ask me.    After the debacle, I canceled the order entirely and they seemed more than happy to do so.  What a waste of time and I will never visit this place.  I would rather drive 30 minutes into the valley for good pho and much better service."}
{"text":"It so hurts me to write this review.  This restaurant is family owned and are the nicest people you ever want to meet.  I had been away for a few months and upon return decided to go to one of my favorites--Saigon Nites.  You don't understand how I felt about this restaurant. It was on my cell's speed dial! At dinner I ordered chicken PHO. As other Yelpers had complained, yes indeed, there was almost no chicken in the PHO.  There was an indication on the menu that you can pay extra for extra meat-- that should have been a clue as I never saw this before.  So if you add the surcharge for extra meat we are talking about $10 for PHO?  As I was sharing  the PHO with someone, I found myself having to remind the waiter that I needed two small bowls. An oversight?  In the past, it was done as a matter of course.   We told our waiter that  we wanted our food spicy.  \"How spicy?\" he asked. We said very spicy. 9 out of 10. Clearly, we like our food spicy.  We ordered Shaken Beef and Lemongrass Chicken.  When these two dishes arrived at our table, they were covered (and I mean COVERED) with red pepper flakes.  Yes, red pepper flakes like the ones you find in a pizzeria to put on your pizza.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  I called the waiter over and told him I had never seen something like this.  I said usually there are Thai peppers or other spicy peppers infused into the dish to render the dish spicy.  He told me that's what they do it now.  I also asked about the Lemongrass in the Lemongrass chicken.  No lemongrass  to be found.  The waiter told me it was there inside the dish.  I should have brought my magnifying glass.  I had eaten the dish before at Saigon Nites and there were shoots of Lemongrass evident in the dish.  In addition, in both dishes the meats were overcooked and dry. We made no further comments, ate the food and left.  How disappointing that one of our favorite restaurants has died.   I truly understand that in this economy that have to cut down on expenses, but cutting down on chicken in the PHO?  I can buy chicken for 79cents a pound and I imagine that they can get a better price.  Lemongrass is expensive, but if it's that pricey you are better off taking it off the menu that disappointing your clients.   I hope that the owners read this review, take heed and make some changes so that some of us who loved the restaurant so much in the past can return."}
{"text":"The location offers a convenient source of Pho when I don't want to drive as far south as Noodles Ranch.  The atmosphere has a bit to be desired as the interior of the restaurant is very plain and inexpensively furnished.  The veggie spring rolls are generally quite fresh and come with the standard peanut sauce.  The veggie Pho here, though, is really just rice noodles with tofu (because I asked to add this) without anything like broccoli or bok choy as Noodles Ranch serves.  Saigon does offer the same plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, and cilantro, and the Pho generally tastes good but is not the best I've ever had.   I also made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine here when my husband and I dined here one evening.  Now, I realize that this is not the type of place that would even have a wine list and was not surprised that my options were basically house red or white wine by the glass.  What I do expect, though, is that if a place is going to serve wine, that they at least have enough taste to discard wine that has been opened for a week or more, which was the case with the glass of white wine that I was served.  It literally tasted like vinegar and I didn't drink it.  I've stopped in to pick up take-out orders several times and am somewhat concerned about the overall cleanliness of this place which makes me wonder a bit about what the kitchen is really like.  Twice now when the staff has brought out my order and placed it on one of the tables near the cash register, when I walked over to the table to retrieve my order after paying, my shoes literally stuck to the floor.  I don't mean that it kind of felt like something may be on the floor, I mean that while wearing sandals, my shoes almost came off when I tried to take a step because the floor had a stickiness factor equivalent to that of duct tape.  Now that I've noticed that, I would be a bit reluctant to dine in again since I am definitely a cleanliness freak when it comes to restaurants and just knowing that the floor isn't clean would really creep me out to eat there."}
{"text":"Saigon Nites is a good \"go to\" place when you are craving pho. It's not the best over had but it's good, staff is friendly, and it's clean!"}
{"text":"Well this place is a staple in my diet.  while currently training for the ironman AZ, it is critical to meet certain dietary restrictions.   These consist of high carb, high protein, fiber, and solid hydration.  I have eaten at Saigon Nites more than 500 times and that is no exaggeration.  Minh and his wife (the owners) treat you like family when you walk in.  I live and die on their Chicken Pho soup and shrimp summer rolls like Eugene mentioned in the previous review.  when you order the pho, you can order it \"ZACK STYLE\" and they will know what you are talking about and probably give you a hug.  Also ask to see pictures of Brandon and Brandelina, two of the cutest little Vietnamese kids ever to set foot in North America :).  Back to the food for a second.  The menu is very diverse offering fish, chicken, meat, vegetarian and they can prepare it any style you wish.  Light oil, heavy sauce, no sauce etc.  Extremely accommodating.  Also another disclaimer, I have no vested interest in this restaurant solely a patron and advocate so they can expand their family business throughout the valley.  On a off day, I will order the vermicelli noodles with egg rolls and pork (not kosher) but don't tell my mom.....  I also ask for extra roughage.  The portions are huge and you will leave more than satisfied.  Back to the Pho preparation, if you like hot and spicy you can doll this soup up so much you will need your own Kleenex.  Their jalapenos are hotter than Heidi Klum and Angelina Jolie put together.  I have seen bald men cry off their foreheads into the soup.  Be careful with the jalapenos, sirachi sauce and there are two other red hot sauces on the table. proceed with caution.  I have noticed 2 maybe 3 hair grow on my chest since my ingestion with the red smooth sauce in the glass container.  This is only for grown men and women alike.   My last suggestion is for the lemongrass chicken extra sauce.  I prefer this over noodles versus the rice and has a potent sauce that is delicious.  I am salivating now writing this review.  As my office is across the street, many times I dine alone.  Next time you stop in there for lunch, have a seat at my table and order it up Zack style and guaranteed you will leave happy and \"pho\".    Zack"}
{"text":"Truly five star in its class:  simple, inexpensive food.  We just spent 10 days in Vietnam and this food is absolutely authentic.  Delicious spring rolls, Pho (pronounced fuh-UH, soft u, we learned over there) and noodle dishes.  Menu is limited but it's all great!"}
{"text":"It's the first day of February in the civilized portion of an Arizona desert. I'm driving to lunch with a coworker and the car tells me it's 50 degrees outside. Neither of us believes it as we shiver under spittles of rainwater tickling the windshield of my car.  It's the perfect day for something warm. My coworker said \"soup\", so immediately I imagine Pho. I can already taste it, but she's concerned she may not like it. With just a bit of convincing and after sharing a few mouthwatering pictures with her, she decides to give it a try.  Yelp leads me to Saigon Nites Vietnamese Cuisine, mere miles from where we work. It is also less than two miles from where I live and I disguise a twinge of surprise that I have not yet explored this local Vietnamese haunt given my appreciation of the genre.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS  Upon entering, we are both surprised to find the spacious interior filled to now-overflowing as we make the most recent guests to an already-filled house. The seating is plentiful, but every table is already peopled and we have to stand and wait a few minutes before being seated.  It's not long before a table opens up and we're settled in with enough room to fit four. Perusing the menu, I am impressed to find that it is significantly more diverse than most Vietnamese restaurants I've visited in my past. I want to try everything on it!  I point out the Steak Pho to my coworker and assure her that this is what she wants. She shrugs and says, \"Ok whatever - if you say so.\" We order two of those and a starter of Egg Rolls. I know this will be a lot of food, but I resist the urge to order even more.  THE FOOD  The Egg Rolls come out hot, set in a bed of lettuce and cilantro. We're hungry, so we ignore the heat and dig in, breathing heavily through mouthfuls of food to try and cool it on our tongues. We both nod and smile with satisfied grunts. It's good.  Minutes later, large bowls of Pho are served to us with the typical arrangement of bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño, and lime on the side. I teach my coworker how to prep her broth (including my preferred addition of Sriracha sauce), then she digs in for a first taste.  It's fun to watch her eyes go wide. I am witness to that moment she moves from timorous curiosity to utter surprise and pleasure. I smile and lean into my own first bite. Despite my \"experience\" with Pho, I am genuinely inspired and a bit taken aback by the taste.  Everything about the Pho came out just right. BETTER than just right. Even the flavor is different than what I've come to expect - leveled up, one might say. The meat is cooked to perfection, and even the noodles have a unique and notable flavor that I can NOT get over.  CONCLUSION  The Steak Pho at Saigon Nites may very well be the best Pho I've ever eaten. Until now, I've been driving myself all the way from FAR North Scottsdale to the Mesa/Chandler area for good Pho. I don't need to do that anymore. I found a Vietnamese gem right in my backyard!  My coworker and I both agree that we will DEFINITELY be back for more. I tell her that I want to sample everything on the menu, but fear that I'll never be able to drag myself past the deliciousness of this \"simple\" Pho meal. I'll want to order this same thing every single time.  If you love Pho, love soup, and/or love good food, you need to make a point of visiting Saigon Nites Vietnamese Cuisine. I am confident you won't be let down. The prices are reasonable, the portions are huge, and the quality of the food is OUTSTANDING.  Saigon Nites: thank you for producing such amazing Pho. Thank you for being right down the street from where I live these days. Thank you for the wonderful, quick, and unintrusive service, too. I'll look forward to visiting again very soon!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with my husband. Very good, very impressed. Fast service, spring rolls were vegan - very fresh and beautiful presentation, excellent sauces. Both of us had the tofu vermicelli - so delicious and again, beautiful presentation. We left with a boba tea for both of use- yummy! We will go back again as soon as!"}
{"text":"If you're a person of color, you may not get great service.  I've been coming to Saigon Nites several times a year for 6 years, ever since I was a senior in high school. Anytime I stop by, whether it be with my friends (East Asian, South Asian, etc) or family, we are hardly acknowledged and given barely passable service. On the other hand, tables of white patrons nearby are greeted with smiles and attentive service.   I've been to many a hole-in-the-wall pho restaurant where the staff are unfriendly to everybody, but it is clear that there is a preference for white customers at Saigon Nites. It is only slightly bothersome, but after stopping by last week and seeing that nothing has changed over the last 6 years of giving them my business, I think it's worth mentioning here.  Their pho tastes good, but is distinctly different from more traditional pho. The broth tastes leaner and thinner bodied than some of the best pho spots in SoCal but is still very flavorful."}
{"text":"Came again during a non-busy period, pretty much got ignored. The owners children ran around screaming the whole time. No refills, no one checked on me, had to go and ask for the check myself."}
{"text":"The appetizer sampler is a must have! It comes with 2 of each appetizers on the menu and 3 dipping sauces. The Thai ice tea is also pretty good (next time I'd get it without the boba since it has a weird taste and texture). The meats here are good quality and I really like the pho.  However the waiter service can be a little slow, they never refill drinks, and have an automatic 20% or more gratuity system if you have 5 or more people (but they applied the gratuity to the after tax amount!) so 4/5 stars total. Next time I'll get take out."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here.  It's a low key family owned joint with courteous service.  Everything is fresh and tastes like something your vietnamese grandmother would make (assuming you had a grandmother and she was vietnamese) ;)  Try it.  It's a Scottsdale gem."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho I've had in Scottsdale!  Now, as far as Pho goes, it's mediocre. The broth is good, but the quantity is small and price high!  It's seems as if they are scared to give you a good sized portion of noodles and meat. I get irked when I sped over $8 for Pho and I'm not stuffed. I think they do try hard here, but get away with the poor sizing and simple taste because they can!    The staff is attentive ms friendly. Overall, give it a shot and order extra noodles and meatballs to get full!"}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese food, haven't had it this good since my days in the Bay Area. If you like Pho and other  Vietnamese dishes this place rocks"}
{"text":"I have ordered out their taro slush boba several times now. So good but more expensive than a ventilator coffee at starbucks. I had one sit down experience here and ate their brisket pho. Not comparable to my favorite ( lpho 43) but probably the best pho I've had in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  This review is based on the veggie spring rolls and steak pho which are the most basic meals. Maybe I'm just spoiled living in san francisco where the restaurant foods are excellent. In any case for whatever it is worth: the rolls were fresh, i liked that. then the waiter brought one dish of sprouts w/ basil. Normally if two people order pho you each get a plate. We asked for another plate and the waiter said more? like he didn't get  why. i'm not sure. then the pho came. each bowl had two small slabs of thick steak, the 'broth' was tasteless.  We will definately not go back, definately not authentic. I'd give it 1 star but because the rolls were fresh,i give it two."}
{"text":"I had late lunch here today,the place is nice and I Ordered Ck pad Thai the food was tasty but it made in different way . The noodle was wide like chow fun,It suppose to be the thinner one !! I have never seen so much lettuce in pad Thai too... Over all the food tasted good!!!"}
{"text":"So glad this place is right around the corner from me!The Pho is delicious as well as the egg rolls! Not in the mood to dine in? The take out is fresh and hot! Sometimes, it's even better than dining in just to be in the comfy, cozy atmosphere of home."}
{"text":"My mom recently moved to north Scottsdale so we're just trying different restaurants around her area. This was the closest Vietnamese place so we had to try it.   We ordered the special pho, bbq pork and shrimp vermicelli and the bbq pork with rice. Honestly none of them really hit the spot for either of us. The pork was a little bit hard to eat. The pho wasn't bad, it was not amazing either, it was just ok.   We came in about 5pm and there were a lot of people in the restaurant and only ONE waiter. He had to answer the phone when it rang as well. There was another guy bringing the food, but he wouldn't stay in the dining area to help that ONE waiter."}
{"text":"Never again   I don't usually write reviews.  We have been to this establishment no less than 100 times.    The lady owner is not very friendly.  And it is not unusual to watch her arguing with customers, we tolerated her because we enjoyed the quality of the food.  Today she had the nerve to yell at us when asked whether they are using a different kind of tea.  As she went back to the kitchen, we got up and left before ordering anything else.   She followed us out to the parking lot hollering at us to never return.    Your wish is granted.  Never again.  Business Advice to owner.   Keep your wife out of the restaurant.  Her presence has caused good regular customers to leave."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant dining spot along the northern stretch of Hayden Rd. The restaurant is appealingly appointed, has a relaxing atmosphere, and the service is efficient and friendly. The shrimp pho I ordered was flavorful, came with the requisite fresh herbs and mung bean sprouts, and the restaurant definitely did not skimp on the plump shrimp. I also ordered crispy chicken wings as an appetizer; they were very good and the serving turned out to be generous enough to be an entree. Considering the atmosphere and the quality and quantity of the food, one would expect higher prices but the food here is actually just as inexpensive as in most Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to eat at if you are craving Vietnamese food. They have all the classic dishes and do them right. The spring rolls are very very good. They are appropriately priced and also rolled to perfection tight and feeling. I really like how they have a homestyle feel and I know the owner is in the back cooking the food himself. Or at least they are there to make sure that the quality of food is great. I'm definitely coming back to this place to eat."}
{"text":"Their pho is really good. I think it's the yummy broth that makes it so. In my mind it's one of the two best Vietnamese restaurants I've found in the valley."}
{"text":"I ate lots of pho in my lifetime.   For a healthy guy with a strong meat apatite, I found the meat in the pho was less than other places.  But surprising I like the texture of the noodles.  Yay! noodles"}
{"text":"Fresh food. Friendly family owned place in a nondescript mini mall. We ended up doing takeout because they didn't have power. Food was terrific."}
{"text":"This place is the best vietnamese I've had.  The spring rolls were perfect - very fresh tasting and the peanut sauce. .... oh don't get me started! Wish I lived here so I could come all the time! Definitely stop by if in the area!"}
{"text":"I've tried many Pho places in Phoenix and Scottsdale and this by far is one of the most authentic places around! I always order the steak pho with extra meat and it's a big portion. The service here is great and the Boba is ways a treat!:))"}
{"text":"Love the pho. Best in the scottsdale area. Service is good but the workers are always sitting around looking bored. The music can get a little annoying at times too. But I love their food they just need to work on the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The spring rolls tasted fresh and the meatball pho was incredible. We will definitely be eating here again"}
{"text":"Good. That's how I would describe the food here. Did to go order of Fresh Spring Rolls, Vermicelli Noodles with Pork and eggroll and a Beef Pho. All were just okay. No chances taken here. Bot much flavor in any dishes nor sauces they provided. If you want Good, Bland  Vietnamese Food then check this out. Not a place for foodies."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the Phoenix Metro.  As you can see from my reviews of other Vietnamese restaurants, I'm a big Bun fan (vermicelli noodles) - I get the combo that has pork and imperial rolls on vermicelli noodles.  The pork is good quality meat and very tasty.  The imperial rolls are crisp and flavorful and not greasy - good stuff! The cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee) is good (but they make it in the back, rather than bringing the fixin's to the table, which I prefer).  My daughter loves to get the Thai Tea boba here with her meals.  The family who runs the restaurant are also very nice.  Really good place to go to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Way over price for the entree. Too much msg ! Got so thirsty afterwards. Sad that we don't have a decent pho places in the north Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I just had a fantastic lunch at Saigon Nites. Right from the start, I had a feeling it would be good because there were THREE different types of hot sauces already on my table when I sat down. A sriracha, a plastic ketchup bottle containing \"fresh hot sauce\", and a little white bowl of chili oil. A great start in my book.   The restaurant was busy, as was the wait staff. All three employees were doing triple duty taking turns serving patrons, cooking, and keeping an infant occupied with toys and a laptop in the corner of the room. This gave the place a kind of homey feel, a subtle assurance that the food will be authentic, possibly based on generational family recipes.   The service was fast, friendly and informative. After ordering the chicken pho, one of the servers quickly brought me a plate of fresh basil and bean sprouts. As a pho novice I stopped the waitress and asked how to properly eat the pho with all of these wonderful ingredients on my table. She kindly told me when the soup comes out I should put the sprouts and basil in the broth, as much as I like. She explained that most Vietnamese usually put sriracha in their pho, however, she prefers the chili oil.   When the pho arrived I basically put the kitchen sink in there. I started out with the sriracha on one side of the bowl and chili oil on the other. Tasting each side before co-mingling the spicy goodness. It was fantastic. The noodles couldn't be better. There was a bit of gristle in one of the pieces of chicken, but it's not a big deal for a $7 lunch. Tip - if I had to do it over again, I would probably skip the sriracha and use about a tablespoon of chili oil. I think I over did it and the strength of the hot sauces eventually overwhelmed the balanced simplicity of the original flavors.   Another example of Saigon Nites authenticity.... If you look hard enough, the menu has a little section of \"French\" sandwiches with pickled daikon. As a history buff (see - French Indochina) this little nugget of information has me quite intrigued and now I know what to order next time.   I left feeling glad that this restaurant is so close to where I live and work. I definitely plan on coming back... often."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food.  If you're a fan of both meat AND veggies, you'll probably like this place.  Exquisite veggie spring rolls (they're not fried).  Excellent main dishes.  Legendary Pho.  (Pho is a Vietnamese soup, it's not like 'Funky mo-pho')"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible. We waited 45 minutes and only got served water."}
{"text":"Sad to say living in north Scottsdale the range of Asian food is very slim and you can't find good Asian food around here . I would prefer to eat pho down in tempe,Mesa chandler area but if I'm not up to it this place actually hits the spot . The pho is pretty good , not the best ever but it definitely is better than a lot of the so call Vietnamese/ Asian restaurants who try to put pho on their menu . The soup is good and tasty . The meat is tender and they actually have a special pho with the tendon and tripe ! These other asian restaurants serving pho don't have that since most people who arnt accustomed to pho don't eat that . Definitely glad this place is up here !!"}
{"text":"Interesting location next to a gas station. Causal spot for Vietnamese. The summer rolls were fresh. Pho special was delicious. Super cheap and they have wine and beer. Quick and no frills service just what you would expect from a Vietnamese place."}
{"text":"HUGE bowls of pho for about $7. The chicken pho is some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Love it.  Nice quiet atmosphere and relaxing music. We had the chicken Pho, grilled chicken salad, and Shaken beef. No disappointment in any of them. The Pho was very tasty and the chicken taste was clean."}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed!  I'm also a little embarrassed that I live just a couple of miles from Saigon Nites and never knew it was there, especially since I've grabbed dinner a few times from the Indian place next door.  After watching an episode of Anthony Bourdain's show, I was hankering for some pho, and a quick search on Yelp told me this was my nearest location.  It doesn't look like there are a ton of options for Vietnamese food in North Scottsdale, but the reviews were mostly good, so off I went.  Even though I blew out a tire on the way there and not-so-smartly drove on the wheel, I still got there and ordered my Special Pho to go (hey, don't judge, they closed at 6).  After the spare was thrown on and a stop to the tire shop to get a new one, I was home about 90 minutes later with what I thought would be not-so-great-because-its-been-sitting-out-way-too-long pho.  Not so, my friend!  A quick zap in the microwave, a little assembly, and I had myself a pretty excellent bowl of dinner.  This was pretty tasty pho, even after the tire fiasco.  And the spring rolls!!  Wow, those had some serious flavor.  I'm so glad I objectively read all the reviews and decided to try it for myself.  I thought it was pretty great, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This little place serves legit Pho, just like the streets of Vietnam....  It's so legit that my daughter even found a hair in her pho (just like the grungy food stalls in Vietnam).  Joking aside, the pho is pretty good, they don't skimp on the limes, basil and bean sprouts, but the service is slow if you're used to the quick in and out of a typical pho joint.  Biggest complaint is the mandatory 18% tip for a party of 5 or more.  With a tip like that you expect white table cloths and glassware, not disposable chopsticks and plastic spoons.   If you're hard up for pho then it's not a bad choice but split up your party of 5 into two tables because the service and atmosphere does not justify 18%."}
{"text":"Just as we walked in we knew it would be great!  The scent of homey broth, cilantro and lemongrass tickled our olfactory glands into hyperdrive!  We had an array of condiments on the table to choose from but the spicy chile sauce was the best, not overly hot but pungent and satisfying.  The pineapple biba was ridiculous!  The tapioca was still warm, the pineapple icy and frothy and it was just the tastiest ever!!!! I generally dont go for boba.  Most have gelatinous balls of goo that are chewy and gross.  These were soft and perfect.  Our Pho was fantastic!  Just the right amount of coriander, cilantro and lime.  We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Its my 4th time eating here, 1st time its OK taste the same as other pho place nothing special. Price is a little expensive for the quality of food. Staff not so friendly"}
{"text":"Delicious! I was also really nervous the delivery guy would get lost but he sure found us with no issue. The food was amazing and I will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Home of the hottest curry I've had to this date! Now when I say that it's hot, I mean really, really hot! I love spicy food and I'm always trying to see just how much I can handle. The first time I had the curry here, I cried a little. It was so hot and delicious all at the same time! Saigon Nites also has some of the best pho that I've had in the valley. Their Pho Ga is fantastic and their Special Pho is made right, tripe and all!  Now the people running this place are the real reason that I always stop in. The service is usually amazing (unless they are swamped; it happens) and they are always very welcoming. This is the kind of restaurant that if you go in often enough, they will remember what you get and if you order it a special way.  When I find myself craving some good pho or curry on my lunch break, Saigon Nites always delivers a quality experience."}
{"text":"I've had better Pho. Our soup came out \"warm\", not hot. Veggies didn't even welt because the broth was luke warm. We had to ask for the veggies that go in the soup.  The crispy rice noodle dish was VERY good. I will be back because I believe in second chances."}
{"text":"Definitely not a place for an intimate dinner with your wife or partner. There was no music, in fact the only sound in the place was the conversation at the other table and the Lego's falling to the floor from the child playing at one of the tables in the back. Someone decided to turn on cartoons somewhere in the back of house (I'm not big on cartoons, but I think it was Sponge-Bob), so the music was finally turned on to drown out the sound of the television.  The spring rolls were decent, but the sauce was bland. My vermicelli was watery and flavorless. My wife's said her pork tasted like Kix cereal, which I hope was not their intention. I love Vietnamese coffee, but decided to skip it because no one came back to check on us -not that there would have been room at the table. Not a single plate had been cleared since we began.  I had to get up to get my check."}
{"text":"terrible food, it was semi tipid. warmed up in a microwave. Fu was not great. The owner ,lady nasty attitude"}
{"text":"Been coming to saigon nites for several years and we have no complaints.  The owners are very courteous to their regulars and the food is great.  I may not know authentic vietnamese cuisine but their food tastes good to me and that's all that matters.  Their thai ice tea is super delicious. It is so good with a hot bowl of steak pho :)   As long as Saigon nites stays in business, we will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant I've found in the North Phoenix area. Their Pho is well served. They have great Thai tee and plenty of Boba flavors. The spring rolls are the best.  Kids love the shrimp wonton soup. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally found an authentic vietnamese place.  This is a family run business.  The place is nothing fancy, but the food is very flavorful.  If your looking for authentic flavor you definitely get it here.  We usually go here for the pho.  I will say it is the best Pho in town!"}
{"text":"Coming from Orange County, California, this place was okay.... I've had better authentic pho. I came here on a Saturday morning around 11:15am to grab some pho with my husband and my two daughters. It was our first time at Saigon Nites. My husband and I both ordered the Special Pho (Dac Biet) and a meatball pho (pho bo vien) for my 2 daughter to share. It took about 5 minutes for our food to come out which wasn't bad but after we took a bite, the noodles were still a little under cooked. We had to wait it out for a bit for the noodles to get soft. My husband said it tastes like instant pho that you can get at the supermarket. Id personally never tried that instant pho so i don't know what the difference is. The soup wasn't bad for me. It was just the noodles that I disappointed in. I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"The prices are a tiny bit higher than other vietnamese places but that probably has more to do with location and rent than profit.   I've tried the curry, fried rice, and pho and all three I have had no complaints with.   The management is really friendly as well, the place seems like its run by a family."}
{"text":"Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure."}
{"text":"Love this little family ran Vietnamese joint.  I live farther away but when I travel to north Scottsdale this is typically where I like to make it a point and go. Spring rolls, all the appetizers and soups are delish! You might be a little hesitant at first but once you order and take a bite you will be at ease. Also, if you are taking a first date here I dont suggest it. It is a very casual tiny place and is a cheaper menu so you may come off the wrong way. This place is more for a 2nd or 3rd occasion, when you want to show you know good hidden kept secrets in the area. If you're looking to be in and out stop in there."}
{"text":"Just like Yelp says, just A-Ok. Nothing terribly exciting about this place other than its the closest place to my work to get authentic Vietnamese.   I came here on my lunch break on a Friday afternoon. The place was very quiet, but that's exactly what I was looking for during the hour of my day I had to relax. Upon seating, service was prompt. She took my order in about a minute as I knew what I wanted. I got the order of spring rolls for $4.99 (an order of 4) and the Chicken Pho $7.99.   The spring rolls came out quickly, and were a tad bit small in diameter but needless to say they were really good. They weren't overly packed with rice noodles or lettuce and had a nice crunch to them due to the lettuce being fresh. There was also a decent amount of shrimp and pork in there, which makes it worth the $4.99. I ended up taking 2 home.   The pho was pretty good. It had an aromatic smell and flavor, which is nice compared to some places that serve it as a steaming bowl of sodium with no flavor other than overpowering salt. The thing that kind of irked me about it is that for $7.99 there was hardly any chicken in it. And when I say hardly, I mean like about 6 quarter-sized chunks of chicken in a large bowl of broth and noodles. Not exactly the bang for my buck that I was looking for, but nevertheless it was still good.   I ended up paying about $14.50 for lunch, which is a tad bit pricey in my honest opinion. Especially considering that places a little further would cost me under $10 for the same meal, and more chicken added to my pho. Oh well. Because they are close to me and the food was quite good, I most likely will be returning, however not as frequently as I would like because the prices are high especially for lunch.    Just as a side note, I understand that this is a family-owned business, which is always a plus. However, I really dislike the fact that the woman who was working the register/taking orders let her 1-2 year old daughter walk around the restaurant from table to table as people were eating."}
{"text":"I keep returning to the same thing here: pho with chicken. What I like about the pho vs. others I've tried in the valley is the noticeable spice in the broth. Others have been good but don't have the flavor you get here. The cinnamon and cloves is more noticeable in this one, and to me, that makes it a more enjoyable and unique dish."}
{"text":"Food is good here.  Today I ordered the shrimp wonton soup with noodles for about $9.  The wontons are a shrimp cake, which is really tasty.  The noodles were also nicely cooked.  With almost  zero ramen options in Scottsdale, this helps to bridge the gap a little.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best pho soup in town....fast easy reasonable...best to get it to go....not much atmosphere for dinning in...."}
{"text":"I got delivery from here using Yelp Eat24. I was sick and really wanted some Pho. I've never eaten here, but I'm in their delivery range so I thought I'd try it out. Phenomenal Pho. I can't wait to go here in person. I also ordered potstickers and broccoli beef. Also quite yummy! So glad I was sick (or not) so that i could order delivery from here!"}
{"text":"Good authentic experience! Go through the door and let the world go by while you enjoy a relaxing environment!"}
{"text":"Despite (or maybe because of) the hilarious 'PHO chicken shortage' review, we tried Saigon Nites. We both had noodle bowls and some appetizers. My wife also tried a 'boba' drink... Which is pretty much bubble tea everywhere else. The food was excellent across the board. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This has become a regular spot for us. Always come for pho soup. However beware of to go orders, we got it to go and our raw bloody meat was on top of our noodles, and when we put it into the broth it tasted off so we ended up not eating it and throwing it away. I'll stick to eating at the restaurant from now on when having pho soup cravings."}
{"text":"This is the closet Vietnamese restaurant by my house.  With such high ratings, I was excited to go.  The pho, bun, and nouc nam sauce was not to my par or even close. I'm feel bad for saying, but this is by far the worst Vietnamese food I've eaten.  I miss my San Jose & Vegas viet food!! :(  Where can I get good Asian food around here??!!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in north Scottsdale ! I love how flavorful their soup(pho) is. Egg roll and special pho with everything is what I order every time. I choose Saigon Nites over TeaLight Cafe, even though TeaLight Cafe is actually a little closer to my house.  Food is delicious and always comes out consistent. Come and eat pho, you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Let's start with all the positives. Amazing customer service from start to finish! Food portions were quite large and you def get a lot for your money. However the pho just didn't hit the mark. The flavor profile just wasn't good. It had an overwhelming sweetness to it. So sad because we wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Saigon Nites cuisine makes me homesick for my friend's mother's cooking. When my friend passed years ago, I shamelessly visited his mom knowing how she'd make me a bowl of her beef pho.  It was a moral dilemma - sit there sucking down her soup as she droned on in Vietnamese, or try to find a Pho restaurant equally as good.  Eventually, my moral compass got back to pointing in the right direction and I never saw her or drank her soup again.  And this is where Saigon Nites enters. When I first tasted this broth, it brought back some painful memories.  Not of my friend and his cancerous ending.  More like me sitting there having to listen to Bao's mom spout a bunch of Vietnamese gibberish while I smiled and wolfed a couple bowls of her awesome soup. Saigon's soup is the exact same as hers - freaking unbelievable.   Anyways, Saigon Nites is totally the shit. Try a bowl of their pho. You won't be sorry. And may you rest in peace dear friend."}
{"text":"I've had steak pho from Pho King Food Truck and it was amazing. However, I was so excited to get my hands on this newfound favorite dish of mine and I was a little disappointed. Everything was fine execpt the broth. I wasn't too fond of this one. The amount for your money is great. Enough to serve me three nights. But I don't eat very much. Not terrible but I probably would get Pho King next time."}
{"text":"Chicken soup for a cold? This is the place to get your chicken pho. This place was pretty packed for lunch. I wish there were more soup options beyond beef or chicken pho. Seafood noodle soup would have hit the spot."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  My friend really loves the Pho, so I go with her.  I have ordered other dishes and they were good.  Guess I would give it 3+ stars.  Just can't seem to get too excited about the place.  Not sure why.  Lunch twice, dinner once."}
{"text":"My first visit, and it was for lunch. The back page lunch menu was sparce. I ordered the crispy half conish hen. I was hoping for some decent fried chicken. Much better than decent, $7 with rice. The place was half filled, service was good. I'll be back for dinner at some point."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best. I am very happy with my first time dinning here. The food was so amazingly good. Friendly customer service . We will definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Just had the best pho in my life. I had veggie pho & spring rolls! the ingredients are so fresh so delicious. Great service & clean."}
{"text":"Growing up in Canada I had alot of exposure to multicultural foods. Vietnamese food is my favorite! Upon moving to Arizona I realized that due to a smaller Vietnamese populace that finding a great Vietnamese restaurant was going to be tricky.. I was lucky to find a few however they weren't too authentic. Which brings be to Saigon Nites! When I first walked in I noticed the owner's family was in the restaurant and to me this is a good sign as so many Vietnamese families are close knit which can mean one thing: Great family recipies!!  I ordered the beef pho and I was blown away! the broth was savory and clear which is a great thing. The spices of the Pho were on point to perfection. Everything about my meal was 10/10. I love this place and will return again!  Thank you Saigon Nites!"}
{"text":"She's back, my inner Vietnamese woman and boy was she hungry! We were driving down the 101 when she suddenly took over and exited the freeway. I could feel her start from my tummy she was on a mission. Soon we were in front of Saigon Nights; a modest family owned place in North Scottsdale. It was the perfect choice since they have some of the tastiest Vietnamese in North Scottsdale, well; it's the only Vietnamese in North Scottsdale.  Tearing into the menu she ordered Edamame ($3.99). Being a super food she knows that it's good for her figure as well as her mouth. The young soybean pods are steamed then lightly salted just put one between your lips and pull. The tender soybeans simply shoot out into your mouth the taste is salty and the texture creamy, you can't go wrong with this healthful treat. Keeping with the lighter side she ordered the Grilled Pork & Egg Roll Vermicelli Noodles ($7.99). This is more of a salad with its ample portion of rice noodles with lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber, and cilantro topped with crushed peanuts and grilled pork chop. Served along side is a bowl of prepared fish sauce which is sweet and salty but not fishy.  This combination not only satisfies her hunger but understandably calms her down.   She rests now, her cravings eased for the time being but for how long? Nobody knows."}
{"text":"Getting a cold? Pho. Chilly outside? Pho. Hungover? Pho. Whatever the question, the answer is Pho.   In my case it was a gargantuan bowl of the steak pho with marvelous amounts of jalapeños, bean sprouts, and noodles. It was good by itself but of course I added unreasonable quantities of their house made chili sauce ...and it hurt so good.   My husband opted for the chicken pad thai and it was good as well, albeit a little too sweet for my taste. It was a little pricey for the quantity but worth it for the authenticity. We got the two entrees and a couple of Tsing Taos and our bill came to about $26. We all know that pho doesn't keep well so unfortunately I had to decline taking my leftovers home.    While the food was good, I can't give this place more than a 3-star because the restaurant was a little grungy and the service left something to be desired...I never did get the thai tea I ordered.  Don't come here for a first date but it's a good spot for dinner with buds."}
{"text":"Oh Pho how delicious you are especially on a cloudy rainy cold day   Saigon Nites had pleasant customer service and a decent crowd for dinner.  I was grabbing PHO for take out, since the weather called for it.  The broth was delicious it was salty but not overpowering, a bit on the sweet side but that's ok a little lime, jalapeños, cilantro & a little more lime helped to balance it out   The prices are just right & the amount of food you get is enough for leftovers   Now I have 2 places to choose from"}
{"text":"Best spring(shrimp and pork rolls you will ever have)!! Delicate and contain plenty of herbs. There pho is very good, as well as their vermicelli dishes. What sets them apart is the freshness and attention to details! You may pay a little more, but it is Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just right Pho! On vacation, I came down with a cold and knew I needed some Pho to get me going. Found this on Yelp and it was perfect.  The broth itself was not oily or greasy. It was FULL of flavor on its own before I added anything else. The toppings were stacked - lots of bean sprouts, onions, and basil. I would say order double meat since it was on the light side for the protein.  We ordered to go and our meal was ready in 20 min. Picked up no problems!"}
{"text":"Very nice and clean establishment...friendly staff...and fairly fast service. My wife loves Banh Mi sandwiches....the pork one of course...LOL. So we stopped here friday night after having ice cream and my wife seemed fairly pleased with her sandwich. I am not a fan of Vietnamese food...but the owner of the place works in the same building i do....man the world is a small place.  So anyway they gave us a 10%  coupon off dinner on our next visit. Be advised though if your not spending more than $8.00 they won't take credit for payment.  So if you a fan of this cuisine...look no further than Saigon Nites. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious traditional Vietnamese food, look no further. This is a quaint, family-owned restaurant that is reminiscent of days before \"big restaurant concepts\" with lavish decor.  It is bare bones in aura, and you can tell they have family members cooking and serving. I'm sure these are their own family recipes. Their sizzling beef and orange chicken are our favorites. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"My Vietnamese friend told me about this place, and now I freakin' love Saigon Nites!    Small, family owned business that use fresh ingredients and delivers amazing flavors for a reasonable fee.  I just can't get enough!  YUMMY!!  So the decor is simple, and clean.  The spring rolls are a great way to start your dining experience.  FRESH shrimp, and veggies wrapped up and NOT, I repeat NOT fried!  Whoo hoo!!  And the peanut dipping sauce is soooooo good.  ***Inside tip- save the rest of the peanut sauce for your main order- it tastes great with almost everything!*****   The Steak Pho Soup is out of this world!  So light and healthy, but really filling.  Only downer, the \"shrimp\" Vermicilli noodles, but the shrimp wasn't quite shrimp.  It was like a hot dog version of shrimp- so who knows what went into it.  The grilled chicken vermicelli noodles on the other hand was perfect!  Fresh lettuce, bean sprouts, peanuts, noodles, chicken and a few other goodies are all in a bowl with a light sauce to mix it all together.  VERY filling, but not too heavy.  Perfectly satisfying!  My kids love the fried rice (not greasy at all unlike other places that serve fried rice), and the orange chicken.    Just stay away from the weird shrimp thing.  They DO use fresh (REAL) shrimp in their fried rice, spring rolls and other dishes, so it was a shock to get something so different.  Otherwise EVERYTHING I've ever had there has been awesome!  And the couple who own it are super nice.  Happy eating at this yummy and authentic Vietnamese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I think pho is not as popular in AZ than in other area due to the HOT BOWL of soup in a hot town.  I defiantly enjoyed my lunch.  Bowl of veggie pho and some fried egg rolls.  Broth was very flavorful, veggie fresh and delicious.  Lots of parking near and clean restrooms...can't ask for much more:)"}
{"text":"Yum! I was visiting from out of town and found this place by searching Yelp.  This was a gem! The food was fresh and delicious and made me crave more for days following the visit.  We got the shrimp wonton noodle soup (clear broth) and shrimp rolls.  I can't wait to visit again and stop here for more deliciousness!"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place as far as food is concerned. Earlier today I had lunch there and let me tell you the quality of the food was as good, if not better, than what I have had in the streets of Ho Chi Minh city.  I chose the Shaken Beef and fried tofu as an appetizer. Two hearty thumbs up to both dishes.  The tofu was lightly fried accompanied by a tiny cucumber salad and sweet sauce. Loved it especially when I augmented it with chili oil to suit my taste.  The shaken beef was served on a sizzling platter with lightly cooked green beans and onions with a few bell peppers thrown in. Sublime! The staff is on top of things with the exception of communication problems due to language. But I am used to that during my travels to Asia.  So the bottom line is: U am coming back to try other items on the menu including the pho! This is going into my Rolodex."}
{"text":"Saigon Nites is one of the few Pho joints on the North side of town.  I ordered me a bowl of Pho as usual, but I think the waitress made sure I knew what I was ordering, so she repeated and asked \"Beef Noodle Soup\" ... Yes, \"Beef Noodle Soup\".  I forgot I'm in N. Scottsdale where culture can be lacking at times.  I'll have me a bowl of Asian man soupy stuff and some noodles - wink! I also ordered some ice coffee with condensed milk - can't have Pho without one of these drinks.   Overall, the Pho is okay. I'm somewhat of a Pho Nazi and this didn't really past the test.  My ice coffee was excellent - Why?  It was served just right!  Not too strong and not too lite.  I'm really used to having it strong and simmering it off with some water to weaken it.  Not today my friends!    Service and ambience is okay.  I really enjoy the Vietnamese art here especially the portraits of the Ao Dai...Girls in Ao Dai - oh my! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese pho is a comfort food for me and always enjoy a hot noodle soup.  One of few Vietnamese restaurants in north Scottsdale, their pho is pretty good, I had better somewhere else but considering location, no complains here.  I ordered pho special, since I saw in reviews here that their portion size is huge, I just ordered regular size. Well, for someone big like me who eats a lot, it wasn't enough. I didn't see it until later but you could add more meats or noodles with extra charge, I should have. I was still hungry after I finished eating. I thought about ordering something else but my server already out a check on my table, I just decided to leave then. Figured it's good for my diet not to overstuff myself.  Very clean inside, liked their decor. I would come back again but remember to order extra noodles for my Pho next time"}
{"text":"Pho is pretty decent here. The broth is not terrible and there is plenty of meat in the soup.  I mean, its really hard to screw pho. Its also hard to make better than average pho. This place is in the middle. Service is pretty fast and the servers are friendly. So it's a good thing during busy times like lunch.  Authentic pho. Good enough for me."}
{"text":"Pretty good - a nice option for pho in the north Scottsdale area.  It's in a nondescript strip mall that's easy to miss.  In addition to the pho, which was quality stuff, I gave the shaken beef a try - a bit oily, but overall tasty.  They've got a whole menu chocked full of rice dishes and I'll likely go back and try some more."}
{"text":"I frequently travel to Scottsdale and thanks to yelp found this pho bowl spot for lunch. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I missed it the first time around, but Saigon Nites has boba tea!  That alone is worth giving it an additional star in my book!    We enjoyed Zack's birthday dinner at Saigon Nites last night and I had the Shrimp Pho this time - it was fantastic!  I cannot get enough of Saigon Nites!"}
{"text":"Very nice family owned restaurant. They are always polite and friendly. They remember regular customers and make a point to come over and say hello.   They prepare and serve authentic Vietnamese food and everything on the menu is delicious. I recommend the Pho over anything but honestly, you can't go wrong.  The prices are right. The place is always clean. It is a great place!   It is tucked away in a random shopping center, but trust me, it is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"First off, this would have been a pretty decent 4 stars if service was a little more considerate.. The food was good- don't get me wrong. It was authentically flavored. I got the fried tofu sautéed with lemongrass and other spices. And it was pretty good. My friend got the shaken beef (bò lúc lc) and he loved it (and he's a pretty picky eater). So I'd say food was pretty successful, but for me, I've definitely had better, since I grew up in Vietnam and was used to more authentic dishes.  I was really bummed that they didn't have any rice crepe (bánh xèo) when I came in today, even though it was dinner time. Maybe they ran out? Who knows, but rice crepe is a solid and beloved dish and should never have a shortage lol The 1 criticism I have about service is that the waiter seemed really rushed about getting our order.. he approached 3-4x asking even after we requested time to look over the menu. Maybe that was just inexperience. He also gave us our check half-way thru the meal. No joke. Brought us the check while I was gnawing thru half of my tofu dish and said thank you for coming. Idk I felt like I was constantly rushed to order and to eat and to leave. But maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"The shrimp wonton soup is amazing. The broth is delicious and flavorful, the shrimp stuffed wontons are incredible and the shrimp are plump. Last time I ordered it with chicken. I was not a fan of the chicken. For my taste (and please keep in mind, I'm very particular about meat textures), I think it's cut \"wrong\" and affects the texture (makes it a bit tougher), so I'll pass on that ingredient. Other than that, I have NO complaints, I'll definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"I  love the Pho but everything else on the menu is average. I highly recommend adding the bean sprouts and jalapeño to the soup really makes it satisfying and filling."}
{"text":"The food was great! Just the wait staff struggle from time to time. So just be patient and you will enjoy. I highly recommend the Seafood Pho!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It had decent Yelp reviews and the employees were Vietnamese. The waiters were surly just as I hoped so I thought it would be authentic.   The food was expensive, bland, and questionable. I ordered beef curry and I'm positive they tried passing off pork as beef. The curry broth was water and lacked spice or depth.   I also ordered stir fried pho i.e. chow fun, but when it came out it was more like stir fried bean sprouts. The dish was 40% bean sprouts and 60% noodles. The shrimp was overcooked and extremely tough.  If you're White and still call Asian food Oriental you might enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The pho is good as expected except being small. nice and clean! The spring rolls is very nice"}
{"text":"This a great place to come and get pho. Sadly, we won't be coming back to this place anymore nor will we recommend this restaurant to anyone. It's not about the food or the staff we had an issue with, it with their manager/owner. She was Absolutely rude!!! She actually yelled and scream at me in front of my children!! We are frequent guest there, we noticed that our bill already had the gratuity added on there without getting notified. All I did was asking when did they enforce this rule and why isn't it not listed on their menu or anywhere in their restaurant. Rather than explaining it to me, she proceeds by yelling and screaming about we are so rude not wanting to give gratuity!! It was a simple question no need for the hostility. She scared my children. Then she chased us out her restaurant!  I feel like I'm being pranked and someone is coming out to say gotcha!"}
{"text":"Worst Phad Thai I've ever had in my entire life! My husband and I always order Phad Thai in Pei Wei. But, we decided to try this Saigon Nites for a change. Since its close to his work. Guess what? I got an upset stomach after eating this food. It has an awful taste and very watery. They shouldn't mixed the beans sprout on the noodles. Because yeah... It will produce water as soon as you mixed it in your hot dish. This should be on top! They even put an orange food coloring and I don't understand why??? The noodles are very saggy, mushy including veggies. As if I'm eating throw-up or baby food. Also the shrimp has a fishy taste and not even deveined. I'm a shrimp lover and I know the taste of a fresh shrimp or not. It's a waste of money. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I'm just not that impressed with the flavor of the food here. And it seems a bit pricey for what you get.  Will give the place another try as there are not that many Vietnamese restaurants in this part of the town."}
{"text":"Very good food, had the chicken pho, tasted clean & flavorful, portion is big, can be shared, although would've been helpful if they had split it themselves. Also had the chicken Vietnamese salad, delicious, as well as the shaken beef. Would come again"}
{"text":"Best Pho in the valley!!! Literally eat here 4 times a week on average. Steak and Meatball Pho for the win. My girlfriend is Japanese and very very particular with her Asian cuisines. Obviously, in America, some of the true Asian flavors can be jeopardized. This particular Vietnamese family is always on point and owns a memorable lunch spot. Thank you, always, Saigon Nites! Stay consistent!"}
{"text":"Let's see:  I've been here two days in a row and I really really like it!!   Pho with brisket is super yummy AND the eggrolls are delicious!  The broth is just the way I like it:  mild and not too pungent because I like to add the hot & hoisin sauce to my liking.  It's a perfect lunch especially on a cold rainy day.        What a treat to have Saigon Nites in north Scottsdale.  It's truly a gem hidden in one of the most obscure centers, the food is good, and the service is excellent.  They took a chance to offer exotic cuisine in NoSco and I hope people try it out b/c it was pretty much empty when I was there both times.  I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"The best pho I have ever tasted in my life. IT IS EPIC and I eat pho everywhere. Nothi,g compares to this place.  It is outrageous how good the broth is. And it is affordable!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as we hoped. Maybe we just didn't order the right things. It was lunch, so I had the papaya salad. I know... probably not even Vietnamese, but it was just OK. Hubby's pho was also just OK.   We'd be willing to try it again. Next time, hopefully a more adventurous menu selection will also be more exciting."}
{"text":"We came in a group of 17 from Cali & they were able to service us!  This place can be as good as what we serve in Southern Cali!   We had pho in various types (highly recommend the special), pork chop rice,  banh xeo & Bo luc lac (beef stir fry), everything was very good!   Surely be back when we visit again!  The place is next to Valero Gas station so can be easily spotted!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and myself had a really enjoyable meal here at Saigon Nites. My initial yen was for the Pho... but we all decided to share a few of the other entrees... and we went for the Beef Stew and a noodle dish.  But dishes were really, really good! The stew was very \"brothy\" (more like a soup)... but the abundant beef was falling apart tender.   The prices are really reasonable.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! I love the noodle soup (Pho). I like the side plate the comes out with sprouts, fresh mint, and a lime wedge.  The place is operated by a hard working family and each dish I have there reminds me I made a good choice coming in.   The chairs are hard, and since I lost 40lbs. following a hospitalization, I really need a cushion. Perhaps I'd go with five stars if I was a little more comfortable."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about this place, especially after my wide range of Pho experiences, but Saigon Nites does Pho, and they do it WELL.  The first few minutes were a little awkward...was I expected to wait for the waitress or seat myself?  I opted to wait politely, but I found others boldly walking in and seating themselves.  Despite this little mishap, the service is great. My food came out quickly and the waitstaff stopped by a couple times during the meal.   Spring rolls and hot tea are necessary components of the Pho experience.  The jasmine tea was flavorful without a hint of bitterness.  The shrimp spring rolls were a hit; I loved the ratio of rice noodles, greens (basil and lettuce) and shrimp--not too many noodles and plenty of the good stuff.  The peanut sauce was perfection.   Better bring an appetite--the portions are gigantic!  I was promptly presented with a steaming bowl of chicken pho and I tossed in the heaping plate of bean sprouts and basil.  I'm not a fan of raw sprouts, but they come to life upon meeting the piping hot broth.  The broth had good flavor and body without being excessively oily or salty.   If you're not feeling Pho, there are plenty of Chinese items--lemon chicken, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, chow mien, egg rolls....The list goes on and on.   All around a tasty, reasonably priced establishment."}
{"text":"Located off Hayden just S of Costco and N of Raintree Rd on the East side of the road. The parking lot is a little scary but there is a decent amount of parking. I called and ordered Pho soup for pickup and they said it would be ready 5-10 mins. When I arrived it was being wrapped up in the back. The man at the desk was very nice. They do delivery through a delivery company but they charge by distance I believe. The inside was very cute. The pictures make it look a lot fancier than it is, but most Vietnamese places are hole in the walls, so this was definitely a step up from that.  When I got the soup home it was still warm. Not hot or cold which was great. I added everything into the broth and the basil aroma just filled my kitchen. They did include a fork, spoon and chop sticks which was great. The flavors were all there but it definitely could have had some more basil, noodles and sprouts personally. I don't hold this against them though because delivery is always a little different than on location. I will definitely be returning! The price was great and the menu had plenty to chose from! They have been around since 2005 and definitely deserve to stay around!!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken Pho!  Vegetarian spring rolls were also very tasty.  I will definitely be coming back here..conveniently located in the Scottsdale airpark."}
{"text":"Ok let me explain this five star.   First off this won't be long. The food was hands down best Vietnamese food in town! Heard amazing things and when me and my girlfriend showed up for dinner we were equally satisfied when we left. My girlfriend got the fried tofu and spring roll noodle and I got the grilled pork and egg roll noodle. With the fresh lettuce, cucumber, peanuts,fish sauce, herbs, and a very well made rice noodle, hands down new favorite spot to eat.  Ok now second off. Not very nice people to be around. Very direct with no smiling what so ever. We literally couldn't even give them a compliment without them blowing us off. But hey I'm a chef and I only count the food these days cause you can't always find good service! Seriously been there two days ago and told everyone I know"}
{"text":"I stayed in north Phoenix and didn't want to drive to Chandler for Pho so I found Saigon Nites on Yelp. Being from So Cal and having so many choices I was reluctant going to have Pho in Scottsdale but it was convenient.   I ordered the special Pho with beef, tripe, meat balls and tendon. The bowl was $7.99 and the flavor was decent but I guess I'm spoiled with Pho from San Gabriel and Westminster. I did notice that the meat balls were soft and not firm like the ones I usually eat. The bowl was a decent size and satisfied my soup craving for the evening.   Saigon Nites accepts Visa and MasterCard with a minimum of $7.50"}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh....when I walked in..it smelt like a mix of a sewer smell and pho...red flag. I ordered steak and meatball pho...and the noodles were so hard! Broth was whatever...overall I think it could of been cleaner..I had to look at all my spoons and little dish to see if they were dirty..which yes they were...won't be coming back. The meat also was way too thick and dry."}
{"text":"I've been dreaming about Saigon Nites ever since I went there some weeks ago.  hmm, what do you feel like?  Saigon Nites I chime!    We shared fried shrimp wontons, they were 'eh', I probably wouldn't get them again. Shrimp Pho, simple and mild, yet tasty! Saigon Nites Walnut Shrimp, OMG!  I thoroughly enjoyed this.  It's a little...different.  It's pretty sweet, so sharing is a good idea.  Mmmmm, YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service!   Rude little man running the front.  First, he took our order without writing anything down.  Took 30 min to get one dish, and it was the wrong dish.  The guy never apologized, only to come back to snap at me, telling me I gave him the wrong item?  Wtf?! Don't you think I know what I ordered?  I was polite and said it's ok, bring me my correct order.  He yells saying it will take 25 min.  That's fine, but wtf are you yelling at your customer over your mistake! ? I politely said that's fine, I'll wait.  Other costumers saw and I know they see how rude he was.    So 2 min later, he came back with his attitude to remind me 25 min! Like he wanted to start something.  I heard him the first time and said it's ok, I'll wait!  After that, we got up and left.    Don't be a waiter or run a business if you can't smile or have some decent customer service!  It was his mistake and he took it out on me.  Go back to bed. Rude, rude, rude"}
{"text":"I just tried this place based on the reviews on here but I was disappointed. No ambiance, though that's not always a bad thing. The staff was courteous but the food left lots to be desired. The spring rolls,  which I always look forward to at Vietnamese restaurants, were wimpy. The pho was ok,  nothing special. I had to ask for cilantro on the side. I'd come here again if I was really craving pho and didn't have time to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not quite sure as to why the Pho has gotten mixed reviews as it is consistently tasty and authentic. I've been there numerous times and generally get good service as well. I've had my fair share of vietnamese food, and this is definitely some of the better I've had. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Ok,  Not great, but ok.  Hey it's Scottsdale not the Bay Area.  Prices are not bad for Scottsdale $8.99 for pho, 4.99 for Goi Cuon,  portions are medium or small in a hard core Pho shop.  But, Once again it's Scottsdale.  I would eat here before I drove 15 miles to the closest other place.  I'm a fan of pho \"pronounced fu as in fun\"  Goi Cuon had decent flavor with mint, lettuce, rice noodles, pork and shrimp.  Peanut sauce was so so but spice it up with hoisin and shriracha.  Had the combination pho.  had soft tendon, tripe, meatballs, fatty brisket, rare beef.  It was acceptable.  As other review stated only got 1 piece of lime and no Jalapenos.  I did not ask for more just used the hot sauce.  broth was acceptable,  it could be a lot better but it was sufficient.  Not a lot of anise flavor I'm used to.  All and all I would eat there again if I'm near the place.  Would not drive far just to eat there."}
{"text":"First time visiting the restaurant as I am always looking for a good place to have Pho, my all time favorite food.  :)  Ordered the Steak Pho and Spring Rolls.  The spring rolls were fresh.  The pho broth was seasoned well.  I ordered extra noodles because another Yelp review said you would need it, but I definitely did not.  Ended up being almost like a bowl of pasta and not what I like with pho as one of the best parts should be the broth, but I don't blame the owner at all as that is what I ordered.  Best pho I have found in Scottsdale, though UnPHOgettable in Mesa remains my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 others just before closing on a weeknight (8:00pm).   They graciously waited as we were slow in deciding what to order. So since some in my posse weren't sure, I got the appetizers going.  I ordered 3 orders of Goi Cuon (Spring Rolls with shrimp and veggies in rice paper), 2 with peanut sauce, and for the one who as allergic to peanuts, with Nuoc Mam (sweet fish sauce). They were nicely rolled and delicious.  I also ordered Banh Xeo (large fried crepe/omelete stuffed with sprouts, veggies, shrimp and pork strips). This was a new experience for my 3 friends, but they all loved it. You slice out a piece, then stuff it into lettuce, add veggies, and dip into Nuoc Mam again and eat. Yummy! They were a little light on the veggies, though, and served it with Cilantro, which is OK, but I like some mint leaves mixed in, too. And the lettuce they first brought out was Iceberg. The second round they switched to Romaine, which is more typical.   The group was happy with the appetizers, and again with their main as they all ordered what they were seeking. One, Lemongrass Chicken with rice; another the Dac Biet (special) Pho with all variations of beef, another, the Bun (vermicelli) rice noodle plate with pork; and me, I asked for Pho Tai Nam (rare rib eye and cooked flank beef noodle soup).  We had 33 Brand beers (Vietnamese) and enjoyed the good company and good food. We closed the place down, and the owners have small kids, so they were very sweet and understanding, and patient with us. We also chatted for awhile. The wife is from south of old Saigon, and the husband is from the beautiful central beach resort of Nha Trang.   Best Vietnamese in the Valley that I know of!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Pho was exceptional! Also had the spring rolls very good. Pad Thai which was ok. Lemon chicken which was good and sweet and sour soup very different but good. Sweet and sour soup would also be good with chicken instead of shrimp. I will definitely go back for the pho."}
{"text":"chicken pho and veggie spring rolls? oh, yeah baby"}
{"text":"Well it was open! That made a decision for us to go there vs. nearing Indian restaurant. And guess what - it was totally worth it. Yeah ice tea suxed, do not order that. But rolls were awesome, as was peanut sauce they came with. Other two dishes we got were pretty good too, can not recall what it was.  Service was good without being too annoying or non-present. Place seemed to be constantly busy with slow/steady flow of walk-ins and orders.  All in all, it was pretty good lunch.  \"I like\"  Eugene"}
{"text":"Worst PHO I have ever eaten in my life. I live in Los Angeles and have eaten at many pho places across the county and state. This is hand down the worst pho ever. The soup base was unlike anything ANY of us in my 8 person party had ever eaten. It reminded me of a watered down  frozen won ton soup base.   Not much meat and the noodles were strange,  like something you would buy in bulk for a major discount at a ran down Asian Market.   The service was horrific! The woman was actually getting mad and arguing with all of us. None of us have ever NOT Left a tip in our lives until this dining experience. Absolutely dumb found by the service.  I do understand why some people left good reviews considering this is Arizona and most people would have no idea how really good pho should taste.   DON'T GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for good Pho so I tried here. The atmosphere was a little hectic as there were a couple small children running around like crazy. Not sure if they were related to the staff or not. I got calamari which looked and tasted like the basic frozen rings you can get anywhere. The broth of My Pho was decent but the noodles were very chewy. I had to bite through them with my teeth. Overall not impressed. Hopefully it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"great vietnamese noodle here in scottsdale. if you don't want to drive to camelback (other pho place). this place will satisfy your craving for pho. they don't have much of other vietnamese food, I think because in this area they don't have much of vietnamese. so if you just want pho, this place will do. if you want other vietnamese food. you have to go to other vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"First time ordering food here, despite having SN bookmarked for years.  Ordered takeout, since delivery charges proved to be too much*, even for someone who is trying to speedily recuperate from a nasty cold (that's me), especially now that I know how short a drive it is for a pickup... I can use the $10+ savings for another bowl of pho, or entree!  Estimated time for pickup (20-25 minutes) was accurate, or at least it was for this trip.  I ordered the Crispy Calamari ($8; buttermilk batter, pickled cucumbers and carrots on the side, and side of sweet chili sauce), Special Pho ($9; thin-sliced steak, well-done flank, tripe, and meatballs, with egg noodles, instead of rice noodles, +$1), and Shaken Beef ($10; stir-fried with green beans, onions, and bell peppers and came with a side of white rice, and I added extra side of egg noodles, +$1).  I enjoyed everything!  Their pho broth is slightly sweet, but this can be off-set by adding slices of jalapeños.  The thin slices of raw steak were packed with the egg noodles, bean sprouts, cilantro, jalapeños, and mint.**  I divided these steak slices into two bowls, poured the broth and other meats on top, and then we added the garnishes.  I didn't care for the well-done flank, and Mom told me not to add any lime, because she didn't like how her soup tasted with it; Mom wanted the Special, for the meatballs and tripe, so we went with that, instead of my ordering the Steak pho.  In the end, she didn't care for the pho... She's still stuck on her Bun Bo Hue (at Mekong Plaza)!  She also didn't care for the Crispy Calamari, but I found them to be tasty, even without dipping in the sweet chili sauce.  I liked the crispiness of the battered coating, despite the app being ensconced in its styrofoam box from the time of pickup, my quick detour to the post office, and finally home, where the goods were released from their non-biodegradeable cages as soon as they hit the table.  If these calamari rings were French fries, they would've been too soggy to eat in that short span of time, but they weren't.  Lastly, the Shaken Beef was as delicious as I imagined they would be!  Well, almost-- I didn't expect it to have a sweet component (prob from the onions and bell peppers), but the peppery meatiness, as well as the crisped stir-fried green beans- I try not to eat inflammatory bell peppers and leave them where they lie- made it a pleasurable meal.  I really enjoyed eating this dish with the extra egg noodles.  We probably won't order the calamari again, but I wouldn't mind trying other items on the menu!  I also noticed that SN offers milk teas (with boba, if you want), as well as Thai iced tea, but I will have to wait until I beat this nasty cold virus before taxing my system with unnecessary added sugars!  Oh, and btw, Visa and Mastercard only, with a $7.50 minimum purchase.  * $6 delivery charge, plus a 15% service fee.  The delivery is handled by a third party, Eat24, which takes your online order and relays it to the business in question, in this case SN.    **  Be sure to place your takeout bags on the floor of the car, in a space where they can't move around too much, to prevent spillage!  I had them on the floor, but with a lot of room to move.  Thankfully, the kitchen packed the soup and Shaken Beef styro containers in their own plastic bags, which still allowed them to spill over their containers, but not all over my car floor- whew!"}
{"text":"In North Scottsdale, it can be hard to find authentic independently owned restaurants that won't cost you an arm and a leg.  Saigon is one of those rare gems where you can get decent Vietnamese for a fairly decent price.  Their menu though, seems to be a hybrid of Vietnamese with other types of Asian cuisine.  We ordered a few dishes to go, and some dishes were definitely better (and more Vietnamese tasting) than others.  The best entrees we had were probably the papaya salad and the vermicelli noodles- both very fresh tasting and flavorful.  The scallops in black bean sauce were more of a Chinese style dish, and the scallops themselves were a little tough, served with an anemic amount of veggies (just green pepper).  The lemongrass chicken was good, but my favorite lemongrass chicken so far is at Khai Hoan, where it is more saturated with flavor.  If I am in the area again and am craving Vietnamese food, I'll probably head over and try some more of their Vietnamese dishes."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp. We stopped by on the way to the airport. The two items we ordered were excellent, equivalent to the good Vietnamese restaurant in the bay area. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really good PHO and wonderful service. Came for lunch with my hubby and parking is crazy. It gets busy during lunch so would suggest going early or later towards the end of the lunch hour.  Food is excellent.  started off with the Sampler and it's perfect for 2 people.  I had the beef Pho and my hubby had the Special Pho (it has meat, meatballs, tribe, and other stuff). Broth is soooo good that's what made it delicious. If your not the type of person to add extra spices in the broth then totally okay. It's great by itself.  Too bad it's a far drive from my house or I would be here on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite place to get Pho in the valley! I've had pho from 20-or-so places in the valley and they have the best!  The owner and her husband are very nice and always welcoming. The food is always fresh and tasty. I normally get the summer rolls and chicken pho.   It's probably too much that they know my exact order when I come in and are puzzled when I decide something different. I've had many things on the menu and never had anything that wasn't good.   If you go, definitely the summer rolls, pho, salt and pepper shrimp (so good!!) or shaken beef.   I could go on and on about how much I love their food. The place is always clean.  About anyone questioning delivery... They don't deliver directly. A delivery service that you call and place you order with will deliver and charge a fee. They are a small business in the middle of a business park, I can understand why they can't have staff to deliver."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dishes in pho. Chicken pho. And the chicken pho here is unbelievable.  The broth is so flavorful and savory; I could eat it all by itself without the noodles or anything.  But, the noodles are delicious too so I am glad that they are in the stock.  I don't even add any sriracha or hoisen sauce or anything because the soup is perfect as it is. And I love that this place is in a little strip mall and owned by a local family."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for as long as they are in business, 10+ years?  Pho has been very consistent with its quality and taste.  Broth is authentic and always well seasoned.  Our favorite items, other than Pho, are spring rolls, egg rolls, vermicelli and chicken wings.  Basically, Saigon Nites is a Pho restaurant, so many of the items on the items are a bit average.  We come here specifically for Pho which is difficult to find in Scottsdale.  This is a family owned restaurant, it is very cozy, clean and friendly.  The husband-and-wife owners do a great job in maintaining good quality food.  Saigon Nites is my family's go-to take-out place and still enjoy their cooking.  We love to support our local business!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The atmosphere is nothing out of this world, but the restaurant looks and feels clean. This is one of the best places to go for authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I've thought about this before writing this because of being a small business owners and understanding that maybe the owners and staff just had a bad day.  I didn't want to write this because everyone is entitled to their own opinion of services and food and didn't want to damage another business reputation with just my opinion. So here it goes. My son and I go here to eat all the time because it's convenient instead of having to drive all the way out to Phoenix or Mesa for really good Pho.  It's good, not great by any means but could be great if you just don't know anything about Pho.  However, the service here is the worst I've ever experienced.  I know that Pho places really aren't known for service but this place is just rude.  Try Unphogettable in Mesa so you can see what good food and service is about and you will know what I mean about rude here. I've just always put up with it because it's just typical of Pho restaurants.  So, headed back to work, my friend asked me to pick up an order to go for her.  After waiting for about 20 minutes after we were done eating for the to go order even though we placed the order when we ordered our other food too, the order came back wrong.  I told the pregnant owner what our correct order was.  She placed the order by the registered and left us there hanging.  After another 20 minutes, I asked for the order again.  She said they are too busy and have decided not to correct the order.  I asked her why she didn't tell me and would just make me sit there and wait.  No answer other than that she is too busy to deal with it.  So, I pay and put under the tip line none because poor service.  Actually wrote that in so that they won't write in their tips, which they have done once before on me.  I reconciled my statement over the weekend and pull out my receipt.  Apparently, I have now also been charged the to go order even though I didn't take it.  Called and she answered and argues with me that I took the order.  This is ridiculous.  We are not some scam artist or willing to lie over some $9 order.  Tried to explain to her that we did not but she just hung up the phone on me.  Wow!!  Talk about hormonal..."}
{"text":"I'm gluten free.  Love the Pho and my favorite is the rice crepe! awesome.  If only the produce were a bit more local/organic - they would really be perfect.   Small place, fast service, packed for lunch."}
{"text":"I eat pho twice a week. I'm a huge fan. This place is my go to in Scottsdale. Great prices, service, and food. The pho is remarkably flavorful. Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"The steak pho is the best pho I've ever experienced. The shrimp one is also good. The spring rolls are my favorite because the peanut sauce is very tasty. You get 4 spring rolls in one order. The eggplant is also very delightful I love to order it with light oil. It comes with about eight triangle pieces of fried tofu. I love this place."}
{"text":"Ideal for lunches, a casual fast service, seat yourself Vietnamese restaurant. The spring rolls were pretty tasty. Not fresh, I could tell the wrappers were a little chewy, but the peanut sauce was tasty. The pho was good but not great. The meatballs were hearty and I liked the ample helping of green onions, but the steak was pretty dry and the broth was watered down and sorely in need of spice.   Tip: the pho is better than second day if you put the jalapeno slices they give you in the broth and let it marinate overnight"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. This is one of my regular places. Always consistently good with friendly, smiling staff. Family owned and run, one cannot ask for a more friendly place with outstanding food.   I have been frequenting Saigon Nites on a regular basis for at least two years and have never been disappointed with the food or the service. And it is consistent regardless of the day of the week or the time of day.   Note: closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I'm from San Jose/San Francisco and there are viet restaurants everywhere and competition is fierce. Saigon Nites has decent pho but could be better. Broth is a little lacking and is a little too salty. Portions are small compared to the \"regular\" bowl sizes I'm use to in San Jose/San Francisco especially for the price. It's typically $8/9 for a large bowl in CA and it's loaded to the brim with noodles and meat. Saigon Nites is the 2nd pho restaurant I've visited in Phoenix while on biz. The other pho restaurant that I visited in December (which will remain nameless) had the most flavorless broth I ever tasted. The \"other\" pho place regular was $8.50 and was the size of what I consider a San Jose/San Francisco small/child sized bowl and had half a meat ball and 4 slices of steak. Given the circumstances of the town I'm visiting I say Saigon Nites is definitely the best in this town and rate them a 3.5 to 4 star."}
{"text":"I really like Vietnamese food and we wanted to try a new place. So Saigon Nites was the place. This is a very unassuming place. In a strip mall that has a gas station next to it. So as I saw it my expectations wasn't very high.   Walking in I was very surprised that the place is bigger than it looks from the outside. Decent amount of tables and it's basically a seat yourself type of place. We found our table and was greeted right away with water cups coming right after.   So we ordered the spring rolls which comes with four fairly large pieces. Rolls were very fresh and really liked the peanut dipping sauce. I know there was shrimp in the rolls but very limited. So rolls were good.  It wasn't the best I've had but I liked it a lot.   I had the lemon grass chicken. It had thinly sliced chicken with onions in a bed of lemon grass and a side of white rice. The dish had a nice kick to it. I enjoyed it a lot and it didn't disappoint.   My wife decided to have the Beef Meatball Pho. Huge bowl. Larger than most bowls that I've been too. Didn't hear any complaints and she really did like it a lot  My daughter got the pork and egg roll vermicelli noodle bowl. Huge bowl again. More than most places but she did notice that there wasn't as much vermicelli noodles but a little more bean sprouts which was fine. She didn't complain but really enjoyed her bowl. The serving for the Pho and Vermicelli bowls were so big that my wife and daughter had leftovers and happy they had some leftovers to take home.   So the one thing I noticed at this place is the place must be some mom and pop shop. All the servers we're Vietnamese and male. So it was basically find your seat, take your order and enjoy. Not a lot friendly service but efficient service. Older man was always filling out water glasses and food did come out of the kitchen fairly quickly. I personally think a few women working up front would make this place a little more friendly but hey they have really good food so I'm not complaining. Just an observation.   I really did like this place and can't wait to try some of their other items on the menu. Enjoy. We sure did."}
{"text":"Got a call from a friend today asking for a Vietnamese food recommendation in Phoenix .. and of course the answer was Saigon Nites.  AMAZINGLY friendly family owned business.  We go down to the desert every summer and we drive straight here from PHX.  Better than almost all of the Vietnamese SF places and definitely on par with So Cal.  Highly recommend the Banh Xeo - crepe and the soup stock is excellent.  Just had to yelp-it because I'm craving Vietnamese food and glad to see all the photos !  Oh and it's pretty cheap - usually under $25 for both of us"}
{"text":"My go to pho spot!! I hate that they close so early but its okay. I still love the food here!!"}
{"text":"We ordered to go and decided to just dine in when we got there, the midget guy said we can't because it's a hassle for them, that's so lame, i'm never gettig food here ever again"}
{"text":"This is my go to Vietnamese place on the North side of Phoenix metro. The food is very good and they will custom make things upon request. The prices are more than fair and the staff accommodating and friendly! This is a winner! If you like shrimp this is the place it's always huge and fresh!"}
{"text":"This is my family go to Vietnamese place. A nice family business. The quality of food is pretty consistent over the years. My son always has the same pho and the owner knows it by heart. We like the pho most, whether they are beef, beef ball or special. We like the calamari and the egg roll for appetizers . The vermicelli noodles are good too. The restaurant has been there for over 10 years (or at least close to) and hopefully will still be there many years."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Prices are okay... I like my Vietnamese on the less expensive side, but we are up in N. S'dale so the location probably adds to the tab.  Anyhow... went with my husband the first time... had a fantastic dish with chicken and shrimp in a brown sauce with pan fried noodle squares...wish I had taken a picture... but wow... yum and a textural experience you can't really describe, okay, maybe someone could describe it but I'm tired tonight and I don't want to get into it.  Told my sister about it... we went there... she also yelped on the same matter... Pho was warm, almost luke-warm when we got it.  Basil didn't wilt in the soup.  Not a good thing at all.  Service was slow, but as expected as it's family owned and the place was full. There is somewhat of a language barrier with ordering...  for the most part...MOST of the order came out right... but we had to ask for alot of things that should've just been done already.  So, I have to give this place 3 stars.. 1st time there..PHO was hot.  2nd time there PHO was not.  I would still def plan on going back there... but's it's not my first preference of Vietnamese in the valley.  I do however hope good success to this restaurant, I think if they got things tuned in right... this place could be a hit in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Did online order, ordered extra noodles and beef to satisfy delivery requirements, what was delivered was about average.  Food was good, but had to pay 2X for normal amount just to get it delivered.  Will not order again."}
{"text":"Chicken wings for starters - love it.  I had the special pho (beef, tripe, meatball) - pretty good.  Hubby ordered shaken beef - also good.  Service was great as well. It's nearby so we definitely found our new go-to place for pho."}
{"text":"FOOD: This place has really tasty pho and bun. I am surprised at the quality of food considering its one of the only Vietnamese restaurants in Scottsdale. The portions are very large and the price is very decent as well. I will be coming back most definitely. SERVICE: Considering its an Asian restaurant, you can't expect a lot of service so I did take off 1 star for that. Other than that, food is good and service isn't that great but not the worst either. Although no one came to check on us... And we were the only table in the restaurant at 3:00pm.  ENVIRONMENT: Pretty clean and they played a lot of backstreet boys music...I can hear them talking in the kitchen the whole time in Vietnamese but that doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"When it comes to Vietnamese food. I'm definitely a pho lover. I have to say after going to this restaurant. Their food was un-pho-gettable!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and pretty tasty. The restaurant is nothing much to look at and it's in an odd little spot tucked into the industrial/commercial park near the scottsdale airpark, but the food is good, plentiful, and service is fast. Convenient for take out as well. Had their beef/meatball and special pho so far."}
{"text":"This place was very good, its always hard to find a good Vietnamese restraunt that has a decent amount of dishes on the menu. We went in around 2:30 and there was no one there so we were served very quickly, and the gentleman waiting on us was very patient with my mother and all her questions and indecisiveness (Is that even a word?). The pho was a good size and there were plenty of vegetables on the side. I loved how they give a nice amount of cilantro in the broth too. The chicken curry was also very good. The next time I visit Phoenix I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"They are Super Slow. It took them 25 minutes to serve my spring rolls and it took them 35 minutes to serve two Pho. The taste was average. The soup base was too sweat. The bean sprouts are Not fresh at all. Won't come back."}
{"text":"The food here was about a 2.5 but the service was a solid zero. We showed up around 7:20 and we're greeted by \"we close at 8\".  Ok, we're both getting the P2 and will easily be out by 8. Seems completely acceptable to us, but immediately after we sat down we realized we definitely upset them by deciding we wanted to eat there. We were handed our waters, food and bill all at about the same time. At 7:30 the restaurant shut off the music and we could hear them talking about us quite loudly in the back (in English) which made for one of the most awkward restaurant experiences ever. The employees here clearly don't give a Pho about their customers, which is sad. We've definitely never felt so uncomfortable and rushed  in a restaurant. If you don't want to seat people after 7pm, please just tell them that. I would have much rather heard \"we already closed our kitchen\" versus heating workers talk badly about me and being rushed out."}
{"text":"This is the best pho place in scottsdale. Chicken Pho and their meatball/brisket pho - amazingly good. I also love their fresh spring rolls. The restaurant is clean and the service is impeccable. Very reasonable price if you live in scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Saigon Nites for years, and it has consistently high-quality food with authentic preparations and consistently average service. Tonight, the floor is incredibly sticky as I walk through the restaurant. They have a lovely new paint job but need a good steam cleaning of the floors. Service was prompt, and friendly. The restaurant was not busy, with three or four tables occupied. I ordered the lemongrass chicken, and forgot that I normally have them add broccoli. This dish is pretty much just chicken and onions over lettuce, and it benefits greatly from a green vegetable. The flavors are fantastic, but the presentation is very plain. Dining companion ordered egg noodle soup, and was very pleased. The soup always has a good portion of chicken and shrimp in it along with a couple of fish balls. All soups here are excellent, the shrimp wonton is especially yummy. The family that owns Saigon nites is very sweet and we have watched their children grow up. Tonight we had the pleasure of the 13 year old son bringing our check. My other favorite meal is the chicken vermicelli bowl with grilled dark meat chicken lettuce herbs bean sprouts and rice noodles.  Sounds like it's time for another trip to Saigon nites!"}
{"text":"Just ate here a couple times in the past 2 weeks. Love it. Great Pho. I also had the vermicelli pork BBQ bowl. It was really good as well. The tender and not to fatty. Great quality, good service and good prices."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. SO fresh vegetables. I loved this place SO much. Good price, huge servings, high quality fresh food well cooked. Awesome. I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot in AZ...I don't care if its a 115 outside i still go in and dominate the pho...its the best pho i've had and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Pho in all of Arizona! Traditional Vietnamese music sets the atmosphere with fast service and amazing food! Super kind and considerate staff, hoping one day they create a Vegan Pho with brown rice noodles! A must-eat of Arizona for sure!"}
{"text":"Best place to get Pho! Their fried rice is also super good! This is the only place I will go to get Pho. The staff is also always very nice"}
{"text":"Called in to place my take out order - fresh spring rolls, bbq pork banh mi and meatball pho. I was very excited to try the spring rolls however, it was the biggest disappointment. Ive never seen such skinny looking spring rolls before. Huge disappointment. The peanut sauce that comes with it wasn't that special either. The banh mi was too salty. The bread was good but not great. The broth of the pho was pretty good though.   Indoor seating only. Tons of parking right outside."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, this will be the best place to get tasty pho. I honestly haven't tried anything other than the pho because it's that delicious. The service is great considering they only have about two servers taking care of everything. They have boba as well which is always a plus. I come here about 5 or more times a month since I work close. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Busy industrial area.  Parking lot is very old but not their fault.  Doesn't look so fancy outside.  But the restaurant is clean.  Very important.  I did not use the bathroom so I cannot comment on that :).  A bowl of pho chicken was $7.50.  Great price for north Scottsdale, or anywhere.  Other places are about $10.  The broth is clean and flavorful.  I would always add hoisin sauce and sriracha.  But after tasting their broth, I have decided to stop diluting the broth by adding sauces.  Kind of like killing a great steak by adding A1 sauce.  if you want, just put the sauces on the side and dip your meat in it, don't kill the broth.  I would def go back.  It is only 10 mins from work."}
{"text":"It's average pho if your a pho addict. Standard Asian service--little talk and you get your food. Summer rolls were average too. Only thing I'll really knock is the bathroom was dirty."}
{"text":"Good pho restaurant! Friendly service, clean facility and good tasting broth. Came in on a Thursday afternoon and it was really quiet. Ordered pho, spring rolls, egg rolls and combination pork chop dish. The rice dishes were good and hearty. Great value for your $$$. The soup had a tasty broth, but wasn't hearty enough. I would order a side of noodles to fill you up. The tea is steeped inside the tea cup so drink it quickly if you don't like your your tea dark. Overall good spot and will be back on our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I happen to be nearby so I thought I would give Saigon  Nites a visit. It's probably been over three years since I had lunch there. I remember it being a fairly good place to have lunch.  I had pretty decent pho there and grilled salmon before. This time I had the crispy chicken wings for an appetizer. They were very good. They had a good crust on them, very crunchy and not oily at all.  I also ordered the Banh Xeo which is a Vietnamese Rice crêpe because I had one at a Vietnamese restaurant in Glendale and absolutely loved it. I was disappointed with this one. It was very mushy on the inside and not very flavorful.  I discovered it was from over cooked sautéed onions.The shrimp and pork could have been a little more fresh in my opinion. The pork was his specially dried out and did not have much flavor.  The top of the crêpe was crunchy and actually pretty good.  It came with fresh lettuce, meant, cilantro and cucumbers that came with the crepe.  I won't be ordering this again.  I have to say that I do prefer the Vietnamese restaurants on the west side and in Glendale. However, this is not a bad option if you are in the area and want Vietnamese food. I had no problem with the service and it does have a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Vietnamese crepe-huge and delicious Vietnamese pad Thai- unique and delicious Saigon nites shrimp fried rice- perfect Beef vermicelli (dry)- tasted great  Thai iced tea- homemade and not from a can Calamari appetizer- perfectly made Service- professional and friendly"}
{"text":"After returning from Asian food mecca (the golden coast) my sister found herself with a hankering for some Thai iced tea with boba.  Research led us to Saigon Nites, and they did not disappoint! In fact, she got a refill, and if anyone's had a Thai iced tea before... that's some serious biznis in the form of condensed milk. Add boba, and you're at about a 1,000 calories, but, like a true warrior, she downed 'em both.  We also had the green papaya salad with shrimp and an order of fried rice, and neither was particularly impressive. The sauce/spices/flavor on both were pretty bland, and the shrimp didn't seem all that fresh. On the plus side, the fried rice came in an ogre portion size, so if you're looking for value, this dish will leave you with leftovers for days.  It may be a sit-down restaurant, but in future, we'll be gettin' boba tea to-go."}
{"text":"I had a shrimp wonton soup noodles, the soup is OK but the wonton is horrible. And I was really thirsty after, I bet they put a lot MSG in the soup."}
{"text":"Sad to learn that there are only 2 Pho places near the office... North Scottsdale developers are you listening? Enough of the chains! Enough of the fast food! Enough of the same old same old!  But I digress...  It was a small, clean comfortable restaurant situated next to a carwash. Now that I know where it is - I won't forget ;0)  The employees are very fast, friendly and helpful. We were promptly seated, given water within a couple of minutes and our water was back to get our order quickly.  Two of us got the Pho (one meatball, one steak) and the other in our party got the lemongrass chicken.   I'm relatively new to the Pho craze, but I have to say this is by far the best I've had. And it was all in the broth. So full of flavor you could literally taste the hours and hours of work put into it. The steak was perfect!! My colleague wasn't crazy about her meatballs and vowed to try the steak next time.   The three of us split an order of the spring rolls which were amazing.   I can't say enough about the broth - like crust on a pizza - the broth makes or breaks the Pho.   We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"great place to go for a lunch bowl of pho! always love coming here"}
{"text":"Best pho in the valley! Fast service. Ever since moving from California to here, (California had the best pho) and Saigon Nites is just as good."}
{"text":"** Review for PHO  I had their steak Pho and was immediately greeted by a plate of wilted basil, wilted bean sprouts, 1 little lime and no jalapenos.  Not a good start.  The Pho itself was \"ok\" but nothing special.  The meat was very sparse and very small pieces and the Pho portion in it's entirety was pretty small for the $7 price tag.  The broth was, again, just \"ok\" and didn't stand out as \"awesome\" or \"great\"."}
{"text":"Awesome food great prices. The Vietnamese curry dishes one of the best I've ever had. anyone that left less than five stars is insane."}
{"text":"Everything was average.  Fairly clean place.  Banh Xeo had to much bean sprouts.  The proportion of veg to meat was off."}
{"text":"Terrible. I have no clue how this place has 4 stars. The food was over cooked, pad thai was the worst I have ever had and the service is awful. I will never go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"The pho was so so,  but nowhere good as the pho in Tempe, Chandler, Mesa, and Phoenix. A dollar or two more expensive than I'd really like.  Also my friend ordered the combo pho and I ordered the beef and brisket pho w/ the large size upgrade and when they came out they were the same size.  They ended up costing about the same.  The server said the combo always comes in the larger sized bowl,  but why wasn't there any mention of this in the menu?  Felt slightly cheated. It was very clean inside though a rare thing in the five places I like to get my pho though."}
{"text":"Great place! Great lunch specials. I pretty much rotate between the sandwiches, pho and vermicelli noodles. The best spring rolls! Great people too."}
{"text":"You'll find good food, clean dining room, and fast service here. I've tried their rice plates, noodle soups, noodle salads and several appetizers and all were equally delicious and consistently. They also offer boba/smoothie drinks as well."}
{"text":"Saigon Nites is our favorite Vietnamese cuisine in Scottsdale. The authentic Pho, spring rolls, and chicken fried rice (for the kids) is our go-to-order every time!  The yelp app makes it easy to re-order for delivery each time!"}
{"text":"Let's just say that this place is great for a quick bowl, they have lunch specials from 11-3 all under $8.99 I got the special pho with a mixture of meats, added all the jalapeños and more spices and it was by far the best pho I've had, the service was great, everyone was attentive and so nice. Great customer service and great food."}
{"text":"I go here because it's close to my work but it would not be my go-to pho place if I had a choice.  The service is friendly, but I don't like that the owner keeps her baby at the restaurant and cries in the back kitchen area.  I get it, she doesn't have daycare, but then stay at home with the baby - her husband is already there and they have a staff that can man the place while she's taking care of her baby properly at home.  An infant or any child does not belong in a restaurant kitchen all day long.   Moving on to the food - I'm not a vegetarian but the person I frequent this place with, loves their vegetarian spring rolls.  I'm actually pleasantly surprised by how tasty it is.  The rice paper is chewy and the veggies are fresh.  I always order pho but not something on the menu - it's called pho tai gan sach.  Basically pho with rare beef and tripe.  Their pho there is tasty but never enough noodles and way too much broth - I guess they do that on purpose as you can order extra pho noodles for an extra fee.    Again, I'd eat here because it's decent and their wait staff is friendly and the food comes out fast."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite lunch spot. The Pho is very good and service was fast."}
{"text":"Place kind of smells like body odor, must be the spices and aromas from the kitchen. The debit card minimum is 7.50 which forced me to go to the gas station next door to to buy something and get cash back just for some boba. Boba tastes good so ill give three stars."}
{"text":"Ingredients are always super fresh which is something I really appreciate in a Pho soup. They are always really busy so I order a lot for pick up during lunch. What I love is that they give you an awesome quantity of soup, rice noodle, veggies and soup condiments even on the go which most places skimp on that when your not eating in but no this place. I do recommend ordering before hand if your getting your food to go because they get very busy"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a shopping plaza with ample parking. There's probably 15 tables at the most as the space is somewhat small. So it tends to get crowded during lunch hour. I'm a Pho addict and will order nothing but that, except for the occasional spring rolls. I have tried their steak Pho a couple of times and seem to find them in the middle of the pack with regards to taste and flavor. I've had better and worse."}
