{"text":"My friend and I had been to the Renzie's Rose Garden in the morning, and since she used to live in the area and has eaten at Cenacolo/Fede Pasta several times for dinner, she took me there for lunch.  Oh, my goodness!  Such a delicious meal, from the wonderful, light, crispy bread with honey butter plus olives as a complimentary starter to the perfect arugula salad with sweet dressing and salty shavings of parm plus red and yellow cherry tomatoes to our pasta entrees: mine tarigolini with crabmeat, lemon and chives and hers gnocci with goat cheese sauce.

Slightly expensive for lunch since the \"lunch\" and dinner menus are identical, but the meal was worth every penny. My friend ordered tiramasu for dessert, even though we both had to take half our pasta entrees home. At the end there was a tiny amoretti cookie for each of us and a tiny portion of lemoncello as a \"palate cleanser.\"

I also bought some fresh pasta and some asiago fresca at the Fede store.  My husband is Italian and makes his own pasta, but even he will be delighted by the fresh pasta I brought home. What choices.

You must try it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is amazing!!!!!! I love all the pasta! The service is great. Just a little small. Make a reservation!!"}
{"text":"It's not very often that after the first couple of bites of a dish I am resolved to come back again to many restaurants.  That is however, exactly what I will do in the case of Fede's.  The all inclusive price ($16) included a simple but tasty arugula salad with a balsamic dressing topped with shaved parmesan cheese.  My entree was the feta gnocchi with mushrooms in a white sauce that included kernels of corn and fresh cut scallions.  This was by far the single best dish that I have had in quite a while.  I knew immediately that I would return to sample the other dishes on the menu.  The meal concluded with a small shot of lemoncello accompanied by two Italian style cookies.  The chef came to the table towards the end of the meal to greet us and inquire about the meal.  This added a very personal touch to an already great meal.  I would highly recommend Fede's to everyone.  Limited seating and hours require you to make reservations but you'll find that it was well worth the effort."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place only one star because the food was really good but the service was one of my worst experiences ever.The waitresses were drinking on the job..Started off by trying to serve us the wrong food..never asked how our food was and didn't refill our drinks till our meal was almost over...we were not the only ones experiencing bad service ..2 tables had it worse than us ..one tables appetizers were served after the main course and you could hear them complaining as well..I'm told the owner wasn't there n that's why it was so terrible..Whatever reason it was not good and thanks to the staff for ruining our Valentine's Day ..Oh wait I almost forgot the best part ..sitting us  beside about the same time I watched a waitress walk over and sit down at the ppls table n say ..omg you r gonna kill me..I forgot to put your order in..Again thanks for the terrible service and hope the staff enjoyed partying instead of working..and yes ..our service sucked and that's why your tip did as well"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic evening across the board.  Busy but accessible.  Just.  Go before it gets worse.  And that is a compliment.  Everything was done well.  The seating hostess, the service, everything.  Now the food...  Wow.  Simply wow.  The menu was interesting and varied.  Paired with a pasta company next door means fresh pasta every time.  Rich flavors on both meals.  But not overly spiced.  It was obvious the chef took enough time to produce a dish that feels like you are the only one at his table.  This may be the best meal I've had in western PA.  Could not recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Fede is a true hidden gem!!!  Their fresh pastas are to die for, but the even better secret is that they are open for lunch 3 days a week.  Monday, Wednesday amd Friday - reservations required.   

I had the gnocchi with fresh corn, green onions and mushrooms in a truffle cream sauce; itwas among the best gnocchi dishes I have ever had.  This includes numerous places in NYC.

Family owned and run - this is the best kept secret I have found in years.  You must go!  They are also expanding into a larger space adjoining them, so the word is getting out."}
{"text":"The pasta here is amazing. It's so fresh and not over processed. There are many different pastas to choose from as well as different sauce options. Everything has simple ingredients and bold flavors. There is also a restaurant here. I've had several different pastas and sauces from here that are take home and make and the only thing I can find to complain about is there are no directions on how to prepare the pasta. I know really salted water but how long should I boil it. That would be nice to have on the packaging but other then that this pasta is amazing. Honestly I never want store bought pasta again. They also offer classes and hands on stuff that sounds like a good time. I'm hoping to attend one soon."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a party of 12 for new year's eve.  Rules were strict- no separate checks, 2 hour limit, cork fees on wine and beer if byob.  Waited for over 40 minutes for table eventhough we had a reservation and there was a 2 hour limit. Manager Steve harrassed us for drinking beer while waiting for our table.  We showed him the flyer that said byob beer is ok.  He said that they changed the rules and that we didnt have to stay and accused us of being rude. Also said that they were busy and that we had to wait for the table eventhough we had reservations.  It seemed like he wanted us to leave.  He was extremely rude.  The rest of the staff was very nice but this guy was a real jerk.  Worst restaurant experience ever.  All 12 of us walked out and went to Lucci's, which was awesome.  As we walked out the manager sarcastically said bye bye and waved.  Huge jerk.  We will never go back.  We will tell everyone we know to never go there.  But thank you Steve for giving us such a fun story...we all had a good laugh- you clearly don't know how to treat people and lost business last night.  Moreover, you lost future buisness.  But not worry as I am sure your bad attitude will catch up with you one day.  Money is better spent elsewhere and recommend never going here."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing pastas!  This place is only open for lunch (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and is quite tiny, so reservations are a must.  It's a family owned business, so you may be served by one of the owners' children.  Service is great and friendly, and the pastas change quite frequently.  So always ask what they recommend, as they have great taste.  This has become a favorite spot for lunch in the area for me."}
{"text":"Everything from the artichoke appetizers to the salad to the pumpkin ravioli were superb.  Portions were filling and you will leave with some to take home. My friend suggested this place and it was amazing. I didn't know this little place existed , but I am so glad I went.  The atmosphere was beautiful and quiet and a lot of fun. I hope to return soon with family."}
{"text":"BOOM! Thank you good lord Jesus for this hid from everybody joint!  Would have never known about it for it not for a friend.  You will not even get here with your navigation but if you find this gem you will RAVE and Refer friends."}
