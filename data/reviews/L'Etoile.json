{"text":"Coming back to Madison after many years I decided to try L'Etoile with my daughter.

We had a wonderful evening and meal.  I highly recommend it. 

We were seated  some bit after our reservation time , but the bar was very pleasant and we got to know the barkeep, who is also the sommelier.

The food was delicious and just having toured Southwest Wisconsin visiting friends, it was delightful to see many of the local vendors they use listed on the menu. It added to the evening for us.

The wine the sommleier chose for us was perfect and fit our meals to a tee.

All in all a very nice spot."}
{"text":"So the only downside of having an amazing first course is that the rest of the meal didn't quite match up, though on their own the entree and dessert were both also delicious. A warm melted local cheese topped with arugula, pear and smoked cashews was...creamy, crunchy, tangy, freshly crisp, wow!

Entree was three perfectly cooked diver scallops on bed of garlicky kale and black lentils with smoked ham bits, topped with a sweetly acidic mix of apple celeriac. This dish could have used more of the celeriac and a bit more crunch somewhere...maybe crisped bits of pork belly instead of the ham that was soft and relatively mild/lost in the mix.

Dessert was solid, a chocolate pave with soaked cherries, frozen custard, cherry glaze. French press coffee was very good. They have a great selection of cocktails, beers, and top notch liquor-- casa noble tequila, excellent scotches, mythe absinthe, others.

Service was truly impeccable, attentive without being stuffy or overbearing. I think that if I go again I will get 2 first and 2 second courses and skip the entree, so I can try more flavors."}
{"text":"Halfway through our dinner, we looked at each other and said, \"Really? This? In Madison, Wisconsin?!\"

Oh yes.

We began by sharing the carpaccio;  served with a shaved radish and pea shoot salad, smoked potato chips, and marrow vinaigrette, it was divine.

We then received a sample from the kitchen:  cold strawberry soup, seasoned simply with pepper, tarragon, and Moscato, garnished with a creamy blue cheese and a few lavender flowers.  Beautiful, and a delicious palate cleanser.

For an entree, I chose the whole roasted branzino.  It was exactly how I like my fish:  perfectly done, simply prepared, and seasoned with a light hand, so you can actually taste the fish.  The accompanying dill new potatoes were fresh, lightly buttery and delicious.

My boyfriend chose the hot paprika crusted halibut, which was really just superb.  The fish - pan-seared, crusted, then finished to perfection in the oven - was presented on a small pile of shredded smoked ribs, all of this nestled on a chickpea puree and drizzled with a demi glaze.  The flavors harmonized perfectly, and the presentation was beautiful.

I'm not exactly sure how either one of us had room for dessert, but I'm glad that we did.  I ordered a goat-cheese creme brulee, accompanied by chocolate biscotti, a candied olive madeleine, and raspberries - so good.  My boyfriend chose the cheese platter, which paired three phenomenal local cheeses with sliced apples, quince jelly, and addictive smoked-candied Brazil nuts.  When we told our server that the nuts were, basically, crazy-good, she brought us a box of them to take home.

Our check arrived with a little dish of sweets from the kitchen:  decadent chocolate mint truffles, strawberry jellies, and a handful of caramel corn.

All in all, it was a wonderful dining experience.  The food was of a caliber that we sometimes don't even see in New York City, and therefore weren't expecting to find in comparatively-little Madison.  The service was impeccable:  attentive but not overbearing, informative when we needed it to be.  The attention to detail was excellent from start to finish.  The wine list was nothing short of fantastic.  The room itself is beautiful, modern yet still romantic.   Yes, this restaurant is a splurge, but it's worth every penny.

I will make one recommendation:  if you can, dine early.  Our reservation for 8:45 on a Friday night ultimately got us seated around 9:15, and the bar was so incredibly busy (the bartender was awesome, but he had no assistance) that we didn't get a drink until mere moments before we were seated.  Fortunately, the rest of the dining experience was so good that it made up for that slight glitch."}
{"text":"The James Beard Award judges must have eaten here when there was a very different menu in place. We had trouble deciding what to order because very little appealed. There is a strange lack of cohesion or flavor story to the menu.....The Asian style dishes were better tasting than other choices on menu, but didn't \"go\" with other dishes.....Our amuse bouche was a teeny little cracker thingy that tasted EXACTLY like a cheezit. Sheesh. 1 of the 4 dishes we ordered was delicious. Two others were \"meh\" alright. The fourth so bland and dull it was't worth the effort to eat. It was expensive and we left feeling disappointed that the \"best chef in the midwest\" put out such an inconsistent meal."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and food.  Most dishes showcase local specialities and seasonal ingrediants.  A must try for anyone living in this part of the country."}
{"text":"L'Etoile is one of those places that you go to for special ocassions but find yourself constantly daydreaming about their delicious dishes! I celebrated my 25th birthday here and sampled a few dishes throughout the 4-course meal with delectable mini bites between courses. Absolutely everything I had here was superb. This is my favorite kind of establishment: seasonal, fresh food that speaks for itself, not a lot of fanfare, classy and simple. The menu constantly changes which is always a good sign in any restaurant. I thoroughly enjoyed the chef's approach in the preparation of the ingredients. Each component shines on its own but when combined they are incredible. Technique and execution were flawless and just a pleasure to see in the plate. 

L'Etoile is advertised as French cuisine and although the menu does have a strong influence of French flavors and techniques I would describe L'Etoile as a modern American restaurant with a French flair. Sounds delicious? Well, it is! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have dinned here quite a bit and I don't have one bad thing to say.
I can't not have a orgasmic sensation run through me when I eat here. 
You could probably order anything and it would be good.

*Awesome cheese selections-Hook's 12 year will haunt you forever to eat. Love how they garnish and present their dishes(not just cheese plates)
*Soups are impressive and very tasteful 
*Entrees are always changing and bring new flavors to try
*Their desserts will make you make noises when you eat them-Sorbets are mouth watering, excellent flavor combinations 
* Great wine list as well-Australian Shiraz will hit the spot if your a fan

Truly a great experience every time you dine there. Their special dinners and benefit dinners are a must to try. It's simply clear that L'Etoile strides for pure goodness in every plate that is served."}
{"text":"Best French restaurant I've ever been to. Every dish is well prepared and tasted awesome. Service was very good. We had a great time. Expensive but worth every single penny.
Plus: they have your name on the printed menu for you to keep."}
{"text":"I've visited four times now, so I'm ready to hand out the five star review.  I visited the old restaurant three times, one of which was during Restaurant Week, and the new restaurant once so far.

As most residents know, this is hands-down the best restaurant in Madison.  The food is simply amazing.  And yes, I visited Chez Panisse when I was living in the Bay Area.  

Each time, the we've enjoyed everything from the amuse bouche to the final complimentary treats.  Even during Restaurant Week, the true test, the food was wonderful and the wine pairings perfect.  It seems that no matter what we order, it tastes wonderful. 

I'll admit service was not as impeccable as usual, but for $40 for amazing food and wine I was more than ok with that.  On a typical night, the service is perfect.  The wait staff is clearly full of professionals.   The atmosphere in both restaurants is like nothing else in Madison. 

If you want the best of Madison, and you're willing to go all out, go to L'Etoile."}
{"text":"When my husband and I were still dating, he found L'Etoile and took me for my birthday.  We have gone back every year since until we moved to South Florida.  My husband even took me there the night he proposed.   The staff is fantastic and very knowledgeable of the menu and wines.  Chef Tory is a FANTASTIC chef!  I have enjoyed every dish I have ever eaten at L'Etoile.   It is pricey but it's also a 5 star French Restaurant.  You get what you pay for and what you pay for is DELICIOUS!  Well worth the price.  My only complaint is that Chef Tory doesn't make his wonderful Creme Brulee enough.  It's absolutely to die for!!!  L'Etoile is definitely a place to go to spoil your taste buds.  Oh and a plus is that most of their ingredients come from local farms."}
{"text":"Never had a dish I don't like at l'etoile. Pork and steak are always great. Had a whole grilled fish once, and it was exceptional, considering Madison is not a coastal city"}
{"text":"Food was really good, but was pricier than other places that I have had comparable or better tasting menus. Maybe that is just because I had been looking forward to dinner here for so long. The Tasting menu was Fun and interesting; it was a great night and dinner but I just don't see myself going back here anytime soon if ever... There are just so many restaurants with amazing food that aren't so pricey."}
{"text":"Fresh, mostly locally grown foods. They get a variety of produce from farms around the city and from the Farmers Market on the Square. I love their warm Croissants on Saturday morning (the Apple one is good as is the Valrhona Dark Chocolate one). They have good desserts too (changes seasonally; I liked their Berry Sabayon).

Food is pricey though, so watch out."}
{"text":"Last night at L'etoile I had a delicious, delicious meal.  Enjoyed two different types of wine (both red and white) that were exquisite (around 75 dollars for each bottle) and a truly delicious dinner.

L'Etoile proudly supports local Wisconsin farmers and lists their fresh produce with its harvest source on the front of the (daily) printed menu.

Amazing selection of cheese, as well-- being both French and in Wisconsin (double trouble!)

For dinner I had:

Heck's Shell Pea Pancake with Maple Cayenne-Glazed Jones Valley Carrots, Spring Vegetable Ragout, Bok Choy, Butternut Brown Butter and Pea Vine Tossed with Maple-Malt Vinaigrette  ($29)

AMAZING.  and for desert:

Dark Chocolate Torte with Magic Coffee Ice Cream, Jameson Whiskey Caramel and Toasted Hazelnuts   ($8.5)

The perfect amount of food and a delicious way to spend the evening.   Tasteful decor, as well."}
{"text":"L'Etoile was named \"Best of the Midwest\" by the James Beard Foundation at its annual awards ceremony in May.  This was a well-earned accolade for them (Chef Tory and staff).  L'Etoile's food and staff are simply the best."}
{"text":"What can I say...This is absolutely my favorite place to be!  I'm not sure what is more special, the staff or the food.  I have previous written about L'Etoile on Urban Spoon, but I wanted to share my thoughts here too.  This is a place to visit if you want to experience what 100% attention to every detail feels and tastes like.  Nothing is overlooked.  This is my go-to location for EVERY special occasion in my life."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I went out for a dinner date celebrating 1 year from our wedding. Wanting to find the best food in Madison, we made a reservation here. My expectations were not only met, but exceeded. The service was exceptional. Our waiter was both attentive and very knowledgable. The food itself was out of this world; easily one of the best meals I've ever had. Although very pricy, I would highly recommend making a trip."}
{"text":"Pretty sure my mouth had an orgasm (excuse the foul language, but there are no better words to explain how freaking good it was).

It has such a warm, intimate feeling when you walk in. And it's not just a dinner, it's an experience. Yeah, that sounds cheesy but the waitstaff is excellent. Also, my boyfriend took me there for my birthday and I had a little menu that said Happy Birthday on it and we got to sit in the window, which has a fabulous view of the capital. (And when we went it happened to be lightly snowing-how perfect!)

They really explained everything that was being served, which is always good. The meal really flowed and everything was just so delicious! Mmm, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

Yes, this place is really expensive. (Like 200 dollars for 2 people including wine and whatnot). So, definitely a place to save for a special occassion.  Unless you make enough money to drop $100 on a meal all the time. BUT again, it's not just the food you pay for, it's the whole experience. Best restaurant I've been to!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fantastic dinner last Friday night. This is a must visit any time we get to Madison"}
{"text":"We had a spectacular meal here on Monday night. The restaurant is beautiful and filled with light, looking straight at the Capitol. We showed up at the geriatric hour of 5:45, which ended up being a good idea on a Monday--we were there until 7:45, leaving time for a walk around Capitol Square after dinner. 

Every course is an event at L'Etoile--from the little appetizers our friendly, knowledgeable server Jessica brought out at the start of the meal to the sweet treats she brought with our bill. We really enjoyed the little, inventive extras, as well as our first and second courses and dessert. 

The drinks are delicious and creative, with a few non-alcoholic cocktails (thank you!) and a great wine list. We had the field greens salad and the ramp gnocchi as our first courses, which were both divine. Entrees were halibut and the \"greens waffle,\" which both offered a creatively presented combination of spring flavors. Jessica happily answered all our menu questions, and the entire staff was pleasant and unobtrusive. Special thanks go to the hostess, who gave us specific directions to the parking lot when we called to confirm our reservation. :)

We will absolutely be back for special occasions. Our viewpoints are slightly skewed after living in the SF Bay Area for many years, but we thought the prices were reasonable. Definitely special occasion prices, but not astronomical. The flavors and service were worth every penny."}
{"text":"I have eaten there 4 or 5 times and while these were by far the most expensive meals I've ever eaten they are also absolutely the best dining experiences I've ever had. The food was fantastic and the restaurant was lovely.

I'm not a foodie but if you've never really tried this kind of dining it will change the way you think about food. I haven't eaten there in over two years but I can still remember many of the wonderful things I've enjoyed there and the next time I'm in Madison and it's the kind of special occasion where I can justify the price I'll happily go back."}
{"text":"Incredible! The food, service, and drinks were all well above and beyond expectations. Everyone from the maître d to the waitstaff to the bartenders were extremely friendly, professional, and attentive. Our server, Frank, provided impressive descriptions of all the menu offerings; his descriptions and perfectly attentive service were only rivaled by the food itself! Between three of us, we tried the spring soup, burrata, Alaskan halibut, Peterson ribeye, French cruller, and the prix fixe menu -- every bite was amazing! I especially recommend the halibut and ribeye, but I would get every single item again. For drinks I tried the French Antique (or something similar to that name, first cocktail on the menu), which had a lovely light lilac flavor, and the Strawberry Sidecar, which was more sweet but with a spicy undertone that I loved. In addition, the atmosphere here was wonderful!  We will definitely be going back, we were very impressed by the quality of the atmosphere, service, staff, and food. We can't wait to see what new, locally sourced and fresh concoctions are offered on their menu next!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Madison!

We appreciate Chef Tory's commitment to using locally grown produce.  It's cool to see him Saturday mornings at the farmers market.  My wife and I like to try and guess the menu he is creating based on what we see in his wagon.

The food is consistently good and the menu constantly changes based on what's in season.  As mentioned in other reviews, they have a wonderful cheese selection.  

The waiters and waitresses are true culinary professionals.  Their knowledge of the menu is impressive. 

Excellent wine selection - a good selection of old and new world wines.  Bottles prices are fair.  

The only downside is that the restaurant is fairly dressy.  I absolutely love their food (obviously), however I don't always feel like getting dress up."}
{"text":"nice food and waiters are even nicer than the food! Great place for special occasion, dating, birthday etc. outside the windows you can see the capital hill. Anyway, excellent night in Madison because of this restaurant."}
{"text":"We started our evening with custom printed menus with our names on them commemorating our anniversary that we were celebrating. Our server Joe was phenomenal. Detailed knowledge of the 3 and 7 course meals offered for the evening. I have a gluten allergy that we alerted them to prior to arrival and all of the options were thoughtful customized to suit my needs. I had the 3 course meal with wine pairing that was perfectly matched  for each serving. We were seated next to the windows overlooking the Capitol. Perfect evening!"}
{"text":"L'etoile is it. Fresh from the gardens of Wisconsin farmers, the food will exceed your expectations. From the fresh bread and butter, to the creamy delectable soup to the exquisite main course. This is the an amazing restaurant exprience. The waiters are professional, caring and compassionate about the individual palate. My review does not justify the exprience I had there. It is vegetarian friendly, with an amazing vegetarian main course. 
The food takes the main stage, I was so immersed in the food that the setting was secondry in my mind.  The restaurant is quaint. The tables are set up to view the city of Madison from the 2nd floor of the restaurant. The view is like a moving portrait of Madison.  

My boyfriend and I went there for our 2nd year anniversary.  This is a restaurant one must exprience."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food weighted with price.  

I'd give it 3 stars for the food alone - average.  HOWEVER, the food is so ridiculously overpriced that I have to give it 2 stars.  I got the Fountain Prairie Farm Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio and the Red Snapper olive oil fried potatoes, Snug Haven spinach, niçoise olive-oven dried tomato relish, saffron aioli.  Both dishes were really bland.  I feel like the red snapper dish I could've cooked myself and I'm not even a chef.  The entire meal cost me like 62 bucks and to be honest my 5 dollar lunch at the epic cafeteria had a much better fish entree (walleye with almond crust) and was way better.  

What I *DID* like was that our waitress was very nice, though our hostess was very rude to us assuming that we couldn't afford the restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the priciest restaurant in Madison, and not quite worth the price tag.  While the food can only be described as delicious, there is not a single menu item that stands out to me.  If you need a fancy place to eat that is consistently good, this would be a good place to go.  It's not worth a special trip just to check out though."}
{"text":"Dinner at L'Etoile is expensive but doesn't feel over priced. My wife and I have eaten here a few times and every time has been a fantastic whole evening experience. The atmosphere is really nice. The service is first class and the locally sourced produce is excellently prepared. The wine selection is extensive with many top notch offerings. 
They seat from front to back starting at 5:00 pm so be sure to book an early table if you want a great view of the capitol dome."}
{"text":"The food was good, i wouldn't say it blew my mind. Its sad to see that these days all a restaurant has to do is tell you the brand of ingredients that they are using and they can charge whatever price they want. I've had my fair share of dining and I'm also a farmer. I really hate when they over charge you for boiling a potato and throw some butter on it and try to tell me that its some special potato from heaven or something. Anywho, the service was good. Better than most places which is always a good thing. But the pricing is outlandish. Their wine prices is crazy, its for really rich people who knows nothing about wine ....CABERNET SAUVIGNON Chateau Montelena Napa Valley 2006 which cost $100 at any store, they are charging 435 dollars, and their RIESLING Weinbach Schlossberg Alsace2009 goes for $40 retail and they are charging 235 dollars a bottle. I guess there's a reason why Tory Miller didn't win Best Chef at the James Beard Award this year. Serve Honest food next time with better pricing pls. Don't charge the good people of Madison an arm and a leg for NYC prices, trust me your restaurant will last longer."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is superb-- the food, the service, the ambiance.  Our server was happy to discuss all of our questions about ingredients (many of which are local and have interesting stories behind how they are sourced or made).  They also have an extensive list of delicious and creative non-alcoholic beverages, which is not something one finds often at restaurants in Madison.  This was definitely one of the best meals I have had in this town- highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am sad to say that I also had a very disappointing experience at L'Etoile. My mother and I were so excited to have dinner there based on the reputation of the original owner and the original location. While the new location is very modern and upscale with high ceilings and a beautiful view of the capital, the quality of service and the food were far inferior to the the hype. 

We first went to the bar where the bartender was aloof and seemed perturbed that we were there. Not one ounce of friendliness came from him. The drinks were fine, but you can get good drinks almost anywhere. 

When we were ushered to the table the hostess was as bland as milk toast. Our waiter was apparently doing his best to emulate the rumored rudeness of waiters in France. I've been to France, waiters there are not nearly as rude as this fellow. He rarely looked at us at all, instead rotating his head as he gazed out the windows reciting whatever he was reciting, on and on, never even checking in to see if we were interested. When I tried to interject a question he talked over the top of  me, ignoring me completely. If it weren't so abhorrently rude it would have been laughable.

I found the menu dull with few interesting items to choose from, but we were hopeful that we would be pleasantly surprised. The prices are very high so one would expect the meal to be amazing. When the meal arrived, both dishes were boring and practically tasteless. For the exorbitant prices they charge, the food should have been delicious, memorable and worth it. 

In the 25 years I was in the restaurant business I learned that going out to dinner is an event and the establishment you choose to visit should treat everyone as if they are coming into their home. No one wants to be looked down on and treated with disregard when they have taken the time and effort to visit your restaurant and spend their money. I do not understand the trend toward snobbery at any restaurant; it is simply bad business sense.

In my opinion, the worst thing for a restaurant is for even one of it's patrons to leave forgetting the meal and unable to forget the poor service. Unfortunately, this was case for our experience at L'Etoile. The ambiance of the room is nice, but the scowl faced and downright rude staff combined with the flavorless food and exorbitant prices makes this a definite pass. 

I can recommend walking a block away to Harvest where I have had fantastic food and professional, friendly waiters who deliver simply wonderful food for a fair price."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent- the location and view of the capitol, the waitstaff and especially the food. It deserves it's reputation as the best restaurant in Madison. This is my place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Get the fixed-price menu. Trust me. 

You'll look at the portion sizes and you won't think it'll fill you up. I'm a big, hungry dude. And it filled me up. Just shut up and get the fixed-price menu. Trust me. Eating at L'Etoile is like taking your gastrointestinal system to a fine art museum, looking at all the paintings, and chuckling pretentiously at some pompous intellectual's lame pun about Monet. \"I guess we know now why they spend so much MONET on this museum!\" 

I went to Graze (their cheaper, homier, larger-portioned next door affiliated restaurant) and had a better time, but this place fulfilled its purpose: A really fancy, really classy, REALLY expensive food experience."}
{"text":"I loved my meal here. After a long day of wandering around Madison thinking, \"Could we actually live here?\" this place helped to seal the deal. 

Can't wait to go back once I am an official Madison resident in a few weeks! Mmm - THE CHEESE!"}
{"text":"The staff was super stiff and overly formal. I found a hair in my first course, and my friend found a hair in her second course. Disgusting. I would have forgiven it or turned the other way, but the service was so awkward we couldn't finish. We felt so uncomfortable we walked out before finishing our meal."}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal at L'Etoile, at this point I have lost track of what number meal it is. If this restaraunt was in NYC they would deserve two michelin stars. The fact that their menu changes every few weeks is outstanding to me, so much creativity going on. You can bet on the food always being creative, delicious, and beautiful. The people who work here are all delightful, friendly, and knowledgable. It's never stuffy, just professional.  

Tonights meal began with red snapper and pork belly, the preparation was very thai influenced and the dish was very herbal. It all worked together great and was served with a great dry riesling. Up next was one of the best cooked foie gras preparations ive had so far, with a thin layer of white chocolate, full of flavor door county cherries, and a surprising, yet delicious, addition of banana. Other highlights included the outstanding beef, really I gave this an 11/10. The beef itself was loaded with all the right beef flavor. it was served with lobster, caviar, and carrots. Every bit as good as any A5 wagyu you would get for 150 dollars. The cheese plates are always thoughtfully prepared and great examples of local Wisconsin cheeses. Dessert was another highlight on this trip, a black forest cake with cherries- paired with a great complimentary port and a complimentary cognac.

By now this restaraunt almost feels like a second home to us and every trip is a great experience. You can bet your night will be spectacular at this restaraunt, and compared to other fine dining restaurants it is actually quite a bargain. I can't sing high enough praise. We've been here at least a dozen times in the past year- that should say it all!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had our wedding reception at L'Etoile.

We had 150 guests.

The food was incredible, fresh, delicious, beautiful, Impressive. We have lived in NYC for about 9 years and have had some great meals.  L'Etoile is now at the top of our list.  We are so fortunate to have had that experience on our wedding night.

Salad
Corn Chowder
Steak/Halibut/Lasanga
Wedding cake....made by their own pastry chef, best cake we ever had.
French pressed coffee
Delicious wine and drinks

Accommodated every request we had.

Everything blew us away, as well as our guests. 

The staff was so great, quick, polite, knowledgeable, helpful, hardworking and calm.
The bartenders were unbelievable, at one point 6 of them.
The venue is so beautiful.
The planning process was so easy.  

I can't give L'Etoile and its staff enough praise.  It was a night that we and our guests will never forget.  We thank them for providing such an incredible experience."}
{"text":"UPDATE 2/28/10: 

Yelp has \"released\" my review after ten weeks in limbo, so that now it appears mixed-in with other reviews for l'Étoile. Interestingly, l'Étoile is no longer just a bevy of 4 and 5 stars; there are a handful of 2 and 3 stars... Yelp has been getting a lot of negative press about \"pay-for-play\" -- in other words, businesses are \"encouraged\" to pay for advertising in exchange for scrubbed (positive) reviews. It's the businesses that have been pushing back (in the Bay Area, anyway). Kudos to l'Étoile for not giving in and allowing for a range of reviews -- if indeed that is what happened (see my intro below from Dec).

I still think Yelp should indicate the \"age\" of a Yelper (Yelping since 2004!) similar to what American Express does (member since XXXX). My argument was that it would show readers that a reviewer didn't just sign-up to inflict bile or award unexamined praise on a business.

Just my two cents.

- - - 

This review will likely be deleted within 48 hours. I posted the below on 12/14/09 and it was summarily removed two days later... (I wonder what will happen to this posting?).

I thought I was providing fair and honest feedback. Yelp's motto is: Yelp is the fun and easy way to find, review and talk about what's great -- and not so great -- in your area.

I guess they ultimately get to decide (I think I'm being \"scrubbed\"). Honest, huh?

My original posting:

3 star rating   12/14/2009  

BEST OF MADISON?

A late seating time (after 8pm) is not a guaranteed table, so when my wife and I arrived on time for our reservation, the table was not ready. That's understandable. It's a busy night.

All seats at the bar are occupied. We are asked to sit in two clunky desk chairs next to an overflowing coat rack by the entrance stairway... ooookay. The chairs are positioned in such a way that force my wife and I to tuck our feet in and lean out of the way to let people by.

We are asked if we would like a drink while waiting (I pass). Upon handing my wife her drink the maitre d' makes the casual observation \"here's a napkin, not that you can put your drink anywhere.\" Wow, that's classy.

We're feeling \"really comfortable\" by this point, with blasts of cold air coming up the stairwell as people are leaving the restaurant pushing past us -- oh wait, there are chairs at the bar! The maitre d' shoves two menus at us \"if you'd care to look the menu while you wait...\" . Is the kitchen closing? What about the open seats at the bar? I don't mind waiting -- that's not the issue -- it's the manner.

I ask the hostess if we offended the maitre d' and why were being made to feel rushed and not shown to the bar instead of being left in the hallway.

At this point the maitre d' slithers over and says that they are just finishing getting our table ready. How am I supposed to know that? Even if the table is one minute away from being ready, patrons should not be left in such an uncomfortable, exposed location when an alternative is available.

He is \"sorry I feel that way -- would I care to wait for another table to be cleared?\" The condescension was a bit out of proportion, it seemed.

And so, our first impression of l'Étoile....

WHY THREE ETOILES?

I would have been happy to rate them two stars (my so-so rating), if I was rating the front of the house alone, since their hospitality appears to suffer from the hubris of having received too many accolades.

The additional star is for a combined effort from:

1. The kitchen -- which created good and presentable plates (amuse-bouches, risotto with shaved black truffles, a mixed-greens with tomato salad as appetizers; the breast of duck with baby brussel sprouts and cranberry coulis, plus tri-tip steak with Bordelaise as entrées; cheese plate to finish, accompanied by a bottle of Duckhorn Vineyards Merlot).

A demerit: the steak was a disappointment in presentation. The escarole, as stated on the menu, was substituted with spinach (this substitution was not mentioned at time of ordering, even though we expressly asked if any substitutions to the menu had been made) and there was a paucity of onion coulis; the meat presentation was rustic \"à plat\" and not sliced in the \"stepped\" manner. All-in-all, a bit more \"bistro\" than \"resto\".

2. Our server Michael -- who was congenial and professional (without being obsequious), and who clearly would have heard about what transpired between myself and the maitre d', produced two complimentary glasses of Talley Pinot Noir that helped ease the tension of the evening for us. Since I understand he is, or was, the sommelier I will credit him for the excellent selection.

WOULD WE GO BACK?

Not really. They are starting to believe their own hype -- a sure sign of decline. And when the veal daube that I had at Sardine leaves more of an impression on me, I have to wonder out loud if the twinkle on l\"Étoile has faded."}
{"text":"The mid-course squash flowers were spectacular. But the cheddar beignet entree was one of the best meals I've ever had. My husband and I loved the view of the capitol, and our server was very attentive without being overbearing.  The food and service was definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, excellent service, and fantastic food.

It was my boyfriend's birthday, and I mentioned that when I called to make reservations. When we arrived we received specially printed menus that wished him happy birthday! It was a really nice, thoughtful touch.

They take great care to source their ingredients locally, which was especially nice for visitors like me; it gave me a lot of exposure to the products of local farms and really made the food something that I wouldn't be able to get anywhere else.

I also really appreciated the small bites of food they gave us to complement the meal: tiny pastries to start, a mini soup before the entrees, and dark chocolate truffles with  cubes of raspberry jelly and caramel corn after dessert. It's the little touches like that that really made this place a worthwhile experience."}
{"text":"The meal was delicious and the service was great. We had the mushroom orecchiette / Atlantic halibut and the Vitruvian greens/Lamb. While I could argue that the portions were a tad small for the price, the food was perfect and the presentation was well done. They gave us two small pastries when we were seated that were nothing special, too bland (I feel those little introductions should kickstart the taste buds but these didn't have much flavor). Didn't try any deserts as neither of the two of us is fond of deserts. My wife chose the wine which she enjoyed. I didn't but that certainly isn't the restaurants fault. We would be happy to return the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"L'Etoile used to seem like a lot of moolah when I was a poor college student. I truly understand its value now.

Every dish is beautifully presented and perfectly executed. What I like best is their emphasis on fresh produce and supporting local farmers (Alice Waters-influenced perhaps). Food that tastes good and does good. DAMN! it makes ME feel gooooooood!

You'll only find a place with such good food at such reasonable, affordable prices in Madison, WI."}
{"text":"Had a mixed experience here.  Arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and our table wasn't ready for over 20 minutes after our scheduled reservation time.  I think they must either over book or allow too many walk-ins because the bar was packed with people grumbling about their tables not being ready yet.

Food was pretty good, but mixed with some courses being much better than others - would have given a 3.5 or 4 star rating for the food, but 3 star overall due to the long wait despite having reservations.  I think the high ratings here may be due to the limited competition in Madison, but compared to decent restaurants in LA/OC/NY/SF/Chi the food was average."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very upscale for Madison. It was very personalized and even made special menus with our reservation name on them. The food was phenomenal although the wait for the food seemed a little long. Needless to say the entrees were well worth the wait. 

I recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Slightly uppity ambiance, but who cares, the food is so good. 
The service was awesome, we had a reservation, and arrived early, so we had a drink at the bar.  I'm not usually a fancy cocktail girl, but these fine tuned hand crafted cocktails aren't a bad thing. The bartender, Aaron, was really nice and seemed quite vested in his drinks. 
Our waiter was also awesome, he had some good advice, like the ribeye is a bigger portion than the rack of lamb, and even showed a bit of concern over just ordering a raviolo for my entree (I ate two other first courses though, hahaaa).
The food was delicious. I don't know if it's this local food thing, or preparations, but how come the ribeye just tastes like heaven? I was surprised to see that they had salt and pepper at the table, we didn't have to use any, everything was seasoned really well.
Also, can someone tell me why don't I live closer so I can try the changing raviolos on a regular basis? 
Anyways, everything was good. Make a reservation and go have a nice night out, it's so worth it."}
{"text":"I have been visiting L'Etoile for more than twenty years, and cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.  In my travels around the world, L'Etoile's food and service ranks among the best that there is!  They also have a great wine list!  The only complaint is that the bill can be breathtaking, but you do get what you pay for!  If you want the same quality food as a lesser price, visit their restaurant Graze next door, that seems to share the same kitchen!  Again, I believe that L'Etoile is Madison's best restaurant!"}
{"text":"Everything we were served from appetizers through deserts had wonderful and memorable flavors.  The staff was friendly and knew the menu and the wine list inside out.  Using of ingredients from local sources and providing information about the people and places things come from is an excellent touch.  The atmosphere is quieter than some other restaurants which means that you can focus on the great food and converse in a normal voice.  All in all, this was one of the best two or three meals I have had in ten years."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated my sixth anniversary with my partner at L'Etoile. It was an amazing experience during which I ate some of the best food of my life. 

First, having told them that it was our anniversary when scheduling reservations, the staff was incredibly attentive and polite. We received complimentary sparkling wine at the start of our meal to toast, followed by custom menus with my name and a special message at the top.

For eats, we started with carpaccio and an oyster stew. The carpaccio was served with a raw, kohlrabi salad and fingerling potato chips. The grass-fed beef was some of the best meat I've ever had. Our oyster stew was a combination of cornmeal fried oysters and a salsify poured over mushrooms and sunchokes. 

Our main courses were the turbot served with roasted fall vegetables and truffle mashed potatoes, and then the pork chop. Both dishes were succulent and perfectly balanced in the flavor and texture departments. 

For drinks, I opted for the wine pairing. At $36 for three glasses of well-matched wine, it's really a good deal. My partner opted for cocktails, which were expertly imagined and refreshing. 

Overall, we had a really wonderful experience at L'Etoile. I think the only negative comment I have about this place is that our waiter was weird. Other than that, it was lovely and we'll definitely return to celebrate future special occasions."}
{"text":"A lovely setting and elegant restaurant, with wonderful service and beautiful food presentations except...the food was bland and in one case, inedible!  We had a beet appetizer and one of the beets tasted like vinegar.  The main course was not seasoned and was bland.  The best part was the dessert!!!  Very pricey so we expected better tasting food.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is irreplaceable for me. I simply love it. There is no better place to go to treat yourself and a loved one (great for dates) after a long week.
I am always blown away by the unique tastes, textures and gorgeous plating that L'Etoile has to offer. Also, anyone who walks in is treated like royalty (even if you showed up without your formal attire) 
I was totally taken by the experienced and professional wait staff and their wine connoisseur is just a pleasure to talk to. 
I would have given this 5+ starts, but I cannot lie, I just don't have the money to go to this restaurant as much as I'd like. It is not for the faint of heart or the sparse of pockets. I try to make it here for dinner at least once a year. But oh how I wish i could eat here more often. 
I always have a lovely time at L'Etoile and I'm very much looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"I had an amazing 4 course meal here with my family from philadlephia. my father runs a farmers market there and was very impressed with their use of seasonal and local foods. We had an amazing pork belly salad and I had duck wrapped in bacon and stuffed with pate, which sounds insanely heavy, but it was not; the portion was small enough not to be overwhelmed and it was not overly greasy at all. It was a fantastic meal. I think l'etoile is on par with top restaurants in bigger cities."}
{"text":"We live in the Chicago suburbs, but this place is worth the drive.

My husband and I are really into the local food scene which makes a trip up to the Madison Farmer's Market to buy a couple weeks worth of groceries capped by dinner at L'Etoile a perfect way to spend a Saturday.

The food here is really some of the best I've had anywhere in the world.  Despite the location in a smaller scene like Madison, the restaurant is by no means inexpensive.  But, aside from a place we ate in Cape Town (La Colombe) when the exchange rate was good, this really is the best value for money we've had in an expensive restaurant so far.  We made reservations (day of) and they even had a charmingly folksy \"personalized menu\" for us to take home.  The menu listed where all main ingredients for the meals were from and the back of the menu listed the different local farms L'Etoile sources from.  

This restaurant would be in my top 5 list of places to recommend to others."}
{"text":"Oh no! It's too expensive? How about you put on your big boy pants and realize that this isn't just a meal but an experience! 

They bring out the food ( which is a 5 out of 5!) in perfect timing. 

Last time I checked their are 5 senses. The restaurant is beautiful. The tastes and smells are fantastic. The textures will vary with each course. The sounds will depend on the company you bring. Take along someone with great conversational skills and you will have the perfect meal. If that is too much for you, stay at home so you don't ruin it for the rest if us. This place is the best. We drove 4 hours and it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"$145 per person for Commencement Weekend Menu 5 course prix fix meal.  Our family of four spent $600 on food trusting that the experience would be truly special.  (One drink each set us back another $60) We have splurged before on other major occassions.  This kind of investment has always been associated with memorable and unique food.  L'Etoile is a total rip off.  Pure pretense.  Poses as something it is not.  The Food was mediocre throughout.  Lamb, lobster, tuna - did not matter.  Barely worth eating.  No flavor.  Poor presentation.  Not served hot.  Only course that had any quality was desert.  Pathetic meal."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. So if you want perfect, here it is.
This is where my parents had their wedding dinner, if that gives you any idea.
Be sure to talk to the sommelier about your wine.

If you drop your spoon they are waiting with a new one, or if your wine is 3 minutes late to your dinner, they will take it off the bill or some such. Wow, so perfect.

I literally had a food orgasm here.
Even the lighting is perfect.

And the adjoining bakery/cafe: Cafe Soleil:
EAT THE MARZIPAN CROISSANT AND THE MAGIC COFFEE. (cinnamon magic?)
You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I have just had one of the BEST meals of my life. We ate at L'Etoile Restaurant in Madison. And not just that the food was great... the service and attention to detail was remarkable. WOW."}
{"text":"There is a reason L'Etoile is a nationally renowned restaurant.  Everything the restaurant does is perfection from the smallest details in their hors d'uvre's to the color of paint on their walls & the lighting.  If someone declares this place to be overrated I can safely say their opinion shouldn't matter to anyone who actually appreciates food, it's probable they must spend too much time consuming Sysco products.  L'Etoile was one of the first to focus on sustainable and locally produced food and it shows with the back of the menu listing exactly where every item originates from.   The chef and staff care very much about what they are preparing/serving and it shows.  It's obviously very pricey but there is a reason for that.  I strongly recommend saving up to eat here at least a few times a year, they will be the best meals you've ever had."}
{"text":"Madison is home to slew of fantastic restaurants, but very few of them offer a fine dining experience.  L'Etoile risty little place steeped in tradition and quality. It has an endless list of accolades and recognition. I also think it might also be the most expensive restaurant in town. 

I came here on my birthday last year and it will probably be on my favorite birthdays. The presentation, the flavor, the service; it's all utterly fabulous. Their wine pairings are what really blew me away. I thought my entire life I just wasn't a wine person, but L'Etoile's sommelier helped me realize I wasn't drinking the RIGHT wine. 

If you've got the money, you owe it yourself to see what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of healthy eating?  Do you love the whole 'farm to the table' thing?  Big advocate of locally grown products?  If so, L'Etoile is where you need to be eating.

Mixed locally grown field greens and grilled chicken breast with a lovely champagne vinaigrette - So simple and so healthy yet so light and sooooo delicious.

Cup of French onion soup (without cheese as I'm counting the calories) - Divine.  The soup has a sweet edge that I loved.

Cozy set-up complete with bench seating along one wall and soft, cushy pillows - Check!

Minimalist décor - For sure.

Chef that actually brings out your food - Absolutely!

Jealous of Madion-ites who can eat here every day?  You betcha."}
{"text":"I love this place for special occasions. The service is excellent. The food is excellent. The wine pairings are expertly done."}
{"text":"Upscale dining, using \"Modernist Cuisine\" techniques. Food from local sources, perfectly prepared. Impeccable service. Great for special occasions. Pricey, and worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I'm so late in writing this review! 

As expected, the food, service, pairings and ambience were INCREDIBLE. We went all out: cocktails, all courses (save dessert) and a wine pairing. Priiiicey? Sure, but worth every penny. 

I won't recap every dish I had, so here are some highlights:

1) Amazing cocktails! I've had some weird experiences with ordering cocktails in a fine dining restaurant and find them so off balance; too sweet, severely alcoholic or just plain wonky. Not at L'etoile! There's some magic being worked behind that bar. 

2) The service was impeccable. We were walked through all of our dishes and their respective pairings. My water glass was never empty, silverware replaced appropriately, table crumbed; perfect as expected. The pacing was so perfect. 

3) The lamb hot link. HOLY FU*KBALL$. Easily the tastiest sausage I've ever had.  On the way out, I was asked what my favorite part of the meal was.  I replied that I loved the lamb hot link and asked what was it in.  I was kind of laughed at, but it was then explained that there were over 25 spices; basically a pinch of this, a pinch of that, and everything else in the spice cabinet.  My hopes of recreating it at home have been dashed. 

Probably should have gotten dessert, but I was so stuffed.  There's always next time!"}
{"text":"Lovely evening.  The service was perfect and the food was complex and delicious. Very pricey, but I felt we got our money's worth."}
{"text":"This was our only evening in Madison, so we wanted to go to the BEST Restaurant and we heard that L'Etoile was the place to go.

....and we are so thrilled that our first and only evening in Madison was spent at this amazing restaurant. L'Etoile should be a Michelin Star in my opinion!! Service was impeccable. Food was divine. We had the House Charcuterie first which was unbelievable, I highly recommend starting with this. The wine pairing was so generous each course, the Sommelier paired each wine so perfectly with every dish and it was fun having to taste a variety of wine. 

The place is beautiful right in the heart of the Capitol Square. The Building is architecturally a work of art, all made of glass. Our table was perfectly situated, great view of the square. Our server, Kenzie was quite pleasant. She made our evening extra special. We hope to be back in Madison very soon. One evening here is surely not enough."}
{"text":"The service is what you would expect at a place like this. However, the prixe fix menu was uninspired and boring. The food was made with fresh ingredients, but the tastes were boring. I wouldn't choose this place for a special event, but if you felt like eating something other than bar food, it's an ok place."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here last night. We had the 7 course paring with wine which is a total of $190.00 person not cheap. The food was good not great. Portion for both the food and wine are very small. If it wasn't the bread we would have to stop at McDonald's.  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Well, this is by far the best restaurant in Madison. It's small plate, and VERY expensive. And each person has to decide if that's \"worth it.\" To compare, I've been to Alinea in Chicago, right around the time it was rated #26 in the world. Much less molecular gastronomy here in Madison, but there really is a thought process into each little plated piece, seeds and all, that lacks in other local restaurants. Well, I've seen the thought, but the execution is consistent and on-point. In a 7 meal course, only one was \"good;\" the rest were \"great\", \"wow\", \"I didn't think I'd like that but it was awesome.\" And most, if not all, of the ingredients are locally sourced. For some people, it's worth the cost. 

The birthday grrl got the 7 course tasting, and I ordered ala carte (too much hassle to fix my dietary issues). The food delivery was timed pretty good even though I had 4 fewer items.

Our server was Nancy. She was very helpful, and made sure we got what we needed. But we had multiple people come check-in with us, to discuss the meals, the wine, refill water, deliver food, and replace utensils.

We were offered a champagne toast just after we were seated, but that might have been due to the birthday nature. 

Then we were presented with an amuse bouche: whipped cottage cheese (without lumps) with chopped asparagus and pickled mustard seeds. I didn't have the cheese, but it was still fun (I love asparagus).

Each course after was just perfectly cooked (shrimp, lamb, scallop, morels, pork belly, soft shell crab, squab, asparagus) and seasoned. I mean each one. The only one we didn't like was the cheese plate had a rhubarb sauce that overpowered the cheese and foie gras, which is really hard to imagine if you think about those two items.

And just like any performance piece, an encore was given in the way of a tiny plate of three small desserts - a lychee jelly, a butter biscuit cookie, and a tiny chocolate macaron.
 
PS. this place is seriously about two people (and 148 miles) away from getting a Michelin star. Just add a water person and a bathroom person. The rest of the waitstaff are pretty consistent on their circling, but that anticipation of my next need is... so... close. Thanks for the dietary adjustments, the sommelier was perfect, and the personalization on the menu was a GREAT touch!

We'll be back for that next special night!"}
{"text":"Well luckily, the staff who guided me thru the seven course experience, did NOT \"dumb down\" the food, as another Yelp commenter mentioned.  In fact, the staff was incredible in both service, as well as with knowledge and explanation of ingredients used, where certain ingredients came from, etc.

The creativity and execution of each dish was fantastic.  sImply put, a rewarding journey with interesting ingredients, great concepts, and rewarding flavors.  Very much worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from the Bay Area. At the time we were considering to relocate to Madison (which is hard given the weather differences) so I decided to explore the culinary options in the city (this is very important for me). We got the tasting menu with wine pairings. The food was good and the staff was very nice. 

We have finally decided to relocate to Madison so I am looking forward to visit this place again. I hope the quality of their food and service is consistent.

[During our visit we also tried the Blue Marlin and Otto's - we are going to miss the Bay Area's Cusine but I think we will survive]"}
{"text":"I've been to L'Etoile a couple times, most recently for my and my girlfriend's second anniversary. Both times, I noted top quality performance across the board in all categories that I am thoughtful of when dining at a restaurant: atmosphere, noise level, service, food and drink. I'll focus on the latter two since the first two are self-explanatory.

Before coming, in our reservation, we indicated our allergies and the special event. We were seated and noted that the menus had a printed congratulatory, Happy 2nd Anniversary, an impressive detail. Our waiter confirmed our individual allergies without our need to mention, another detail we don't observe at other fine dining restaurants. Great start.

We were greeted by our waiter, Olen, with champagne and a little bite to whet the appetite. He explained this was a congratulatory start to our special night. Olen was consistently on the ball all evening; perfectly timing checking up on us and delivering food, providing excellent recommendations on the drink menu, providing interesting history of the food, and maintaining the utmost standard of courtesy.

We were lucky to get the tasting menu; it's my favorite way to enjoy a variety of flavors and explore a diverse creativity. Hats off to Chef Tory Miller and the rest of the chefs here. The food was perfectly cooked and were representative of fresh, local flavor. A great mix of varying  temperatures and textures on dishes. Even the dishes that werent neccessarily my preference I could sincerely appreciate for its outstanding significance and presentation.

A great evening that could not be improved upon in any particular way. Thanks for an exceptional  experience, L'Etoile."}
{"text":"Unimpressed would be the best way to describe how we felt. The food was creative, well thought out, and excellent, but not nearly for the price. I'm willing to shell out quite a few dollars for a phenomenal meal, but it has to be just that, and I can only describe the food at L'Etoile as \"very good.\" Unfortunately, I can't describe the service that way at all. Our waiter was downright rude during service (\"I assume you haven't been to an establishment as fine as this before,\" \"I'm not sure if you understand the concept of a fixed price menu, but we do not substitute except for in the rarest of cases,\" to my mother who we warned them upon reservation is a vegetarian) and minimally helpful with wine selection. 

Good food is what I live for. I've been to my fair share of really good restaurants, to places that've been truly inventive and refined, and they were all, without a doubt, a significantly better experience at a significantly better price. James Beard Award, Michelin star, whatever - you still have to bring it at service, and L'Etoile just plain didn't. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Fun tasting menu experience!  By no means perfect, but worth the $100+ price given the quality of the ingredients and great flavor combinations.

I wrote more about the food in the captions of the pictures, but the definitive highlights for me were the foie gras, the beef, and the dessert; so amazing in both textures and flavors.  Let downs included the scallops, the duck, and the bread.  Crab was decent, as was the butter (can't believe it was made  the same afternoon!).

The setting was pretty fantastic, with glass walls right next to the capitol so you can see the building lit up at night. Elegant and dim (but not too dim), with great service.  Each person who presented the courses walked us through what components were present in the same even cadence.  Some minor quibbles: on the scallop dish it was obvious that the fingerprints had not been wiped off the dish, which was somewhat off-putting. Also, the timing of the courses varied dramatically, with some long pauses and others that had a dish right after another.  Not sure what happened there.

Overall, a great experience (though my BF thought there wasn't enough food) and would come again in the future."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to go to L'Etoile about a month ago as a thank you dinner from a generous colleague.  So spur of the moment the hubby and I looked to see if we could get a table on a Friday night.  Somewhat surprisingly to me, we didn't have any trouble at all, and the restaurant wasn't even super busy while we were there.  We chose to be seated up in the mezzanine area rather than by the window so we could have a little quieter space, plus I enjoyed looking out over the restaurant from our vantage point.

We chose to do the a la carte menu and each picked a small plate, entree, and dessert for ourselves.  We also decided to do wine by the glass rather than a bottle.  I wasn't sure I wanted to drink my half of the bottle and while the options were varied and many, they were also mostly on the pricier side.  While I certainly don't mind paying a pretty penny for a REALLY good wine, I also don't feel like most bottles need to be over $100 and I just wasn't feeling it that night.  

Once we sat down and started perusing the menu (even though I already knew what I was going to order because who goes to a restaurant without looking at the menu beforehand??) we were brought an amuse bouche and they brought us different ones due to the hubby's apple allergy.  It was a very tasty bite and added a nice bit of class that we felt throughout the whole evening.  We received another one at the end of the meal after we had finished dessert and were enjoying the last of our drinks.

I order the duck confit for my first dish, the black cod for my main dish, and the dark chocolate tart for my dessert.  All of these were very well prepared and enjoyed immensely.  

The service we received throughout the evening was wonderful.  Our waiter was attentive but gave us plenty of space as we were really trying to just slow down and enjoy each other's company after I had a really taxing week at work.  The only slight hiccup was that it took a reeeeally long time for my cocktail to come that I ordered to go with my dessert.  When our waiter realized that I wasn't eating my dessert very quickly as I clearly wanted to enjoy it with my drink he went to see what was taking so long and brought it up soon after.  He apologized for the delay and comped the drink from our bill since I wasn't going to be able to enjoy it as I had intended.  It was a really good cocktail though.  

Overall I supremely enjoyed my meal at L'Etoile and would definitely come back for a special occasion or if someone else is footing the bill!  I think it is worth the money you pay, unfortunately I just can't enjoy that as often as I would like.  I would certainly rank this as one of the best restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"I had dinner there again, and while the food and service is great the portions of the food is for a 10 year old kid to eat out of. Every time I ate at this restaurant I left and went to another restaurant to fill my body demand. The food taste great and I don't mind spending few hundreds for a dinner but at least I'll like to leave with a satisfied stomach. I'm not an overweight person but if you give me a steak of the size of a half dollar bill then it's clearly that I'm not going to be happy about that."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this year during Restaurant Week and had a great meal. Have gone back once for a Tuesday Night Comfort Food Family Style Dinner and that was excellent as well. Great deal on prix-fixe nights and worthy of a splurge for a nice night out. We'll be back."}
{"text":"To get the obvious out of the way - yes, this place is crazy expensive.  But if you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion, it's definitely worth it.  I was actually most impressed by the knowledge and professionalism of our waiter; my dad is a wine nut, and he was happy to answer all his questions about pairings and such.  We also tried the most delicious flight of dessert wines ever!  Not sure when I'll be back because as I said, it's very expensive, but I really enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"I was told this place is Madison's Chez Panisse (Berkeley, CA) and after several encounters at L'Etoile, I would go further to say, this place is SO MUCH BETTER.

Love it.

Service: 4.5
Friendly friendly service, calm and composed professional waiters, making you feel at home and enjoy the wonderful dinner. One thing to note, you NEED to take 2 to 3 hours for a meal here. With such good food, how can you NOT enjoy it slowly? Also, their last opening for reservation is 8:30pm, so that customers have at least 2 hours to enjoy their meal. If you call ahead to let them know the occasion, they'll personalise the menu for you!

Food: 5
There's always a new surprise when I visit. Love all the local food flavors, yet with such new combinations each week. The 3 course Prix Fixe is from Mondays to Thursdays, and goes at a reasonable price of $39. I can't tell you how much I love their bread, their butter, their complimentary soup and little sweets at the end. It is AWESOME. 

Ambience: 5
I would say personally I preferred the old cosy location by Old Fashioned.. But, the new place has such AMAZING views! The Capitol glimmers through the glass building!! And this is such a romantic place to go to, I've heard so many of my friends talk about their marriage proposals at L'Etoile :)

I can't tell you favorites... since they have new flavors every week. But, rest assured, you will not be disappointed. 

For such a reasonably priced restaurant, the dishes they serve are god-like. Michelin star reviewers! Where have you been and you've REALLY REALLY been missing out."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here every year for our birthdays and anniversary for the past 3-4 years. It's a new tradition that we plan to keep for many many years to come. The place is beautiful and the service is first class. The food is delicious; I have yet had anything that is disappointing; neither had my husband. I'd definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out or a special celebration."}
{"text":"***L'Etoile is a very good contemporary fine dining restaurant, but it is also a great showcase of Midwestern farms, Wisconsin cheese and grass fed beef***

More than any restaurant I have tried in the Midwest, L'Etoile is truly committed to local, seasonal cuisine.  The back of the menu lists the many local farms that L'Etoile uses to produce its contemporary fine dining cuisine and the freshness and quality really come across.  A lot of their produce burst with flavor and freshness that is easy to find in California but difficult to find elsewhere.

In addition to the fresh ingredients, L'Etoile utilizes a lot of premium ingredients like chanterelles, high quality prosciutto, buttery and velvety foie gras, and grass fed, dry aged beef. The kitchen also shows great versatility whether it is a fresh and vibrant salad like their tomato, cantaloupe, arugula, and prosciutto salad, an intense and refined fine dining dish like their foie gras with sweet corn, chanterelles and blueberry gastrique or a hearty Midwestern dish like their New York Strip with mashed potatoes, mushrooms and bearnaise.

I enjoyed all the savory courses I had.  Their cantaloupe in their starter salad had a great sweetness and the aftertaste of that fruit was mellowed out.  In addition, the dish was one of the menu items utilizing Asian ingredients (the head chef Tory Miller has an Asian heritage).  The cantaloupe was marinated like kimchi to provided a nice spiciness.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#1Dm_XzeFUsGbh-7ea6UYpw

The seared foie gras was very good--buttery and creamy on the inside and a slightly crispy exterior.  All of the garnishes stood out--earthy chanterelles, very sweet summer corn and a sweet and tart blueberry gastrique.  I think the dish could have benefitted from brioche, a crumble or a streusel because of the creaminess of the dish.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#kZci-HIMA6X0QDqBEI8hxw

They do beef very well here.  They source from a farm that dry ages their beef. L'Etoile then performs additional dry aging.  With dry aging, you can make the meat more flavorful but which can sacrifice juiciness.  That was not the case here.  Despite being a New York Strip and being dry aged, the meat was very tender and juicy.

The meat also had a really strong beef flavor, which you do not always get (even with good beef).  The outside crust was also good--slightly crisp and very flavorful.  The side of mashed potatoes was also very good--rich and very thick (like good French pomme purée).  The other sides (like overcooked shiitake mushrooms) were very ordinary--the kind of food you would get at a run of the mill steakhouse.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#X9QeW2cMEXDG8iUldS1h1Q

For cheeses, they feature 30 varieties of cheese from Wisconsin.  I did not love the cow's milk cheese I had, but it was more because it was not my kind of cheese.  I like softer and creamier cheeses.  The cheese did have a complex flavor--nutty like gouda but also with salty Parmesan notes.  The garnishes were great--really flavorful and crisp walnut toast, spicy hazelnuts and a really good fruit paste of cherries and berries.

For dessert, I had their warm polenta cake with blueberry compote.  The cake was good as was the blueberry topping.  The garnishes did not work though.  I liked the caramel corn but the regular corn (not treated in any way to produce a different texture) just did not work as a dessert. The sour cream and blueberry sorbet was icy and tart.  And given that the polenta cake was not incredibly sweet or rich, I think a good ice cream would have been the better way to go.

Service was excellent.  My server Jessica was very personable, polite and polished.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu, which made me very confident on what I was ordering.  Despite the many courses, the food came out at a very even pace.

Prices are high at L'Etoile, but the quality is very good and portions on several items are very generous.

L'Etoile occupies a very nice space. The room is elegant but also contemporary and the huge windows allow a lot of great natural light to fill the room as well as allow patrons to view Madison's picturesque and lively capital square.

I have not dined at many restaurants in Wisconsin, but I would imagine that L'Etoile has to be one of the very best.  It is one of the best Midwestern restaurants I have been to outside of Chicago.  With its focus on local farms, Wisconsin cheese, high quality beef, and contemporary cooking techniques/styles, L'Etoile is a great restaurant to experience cuisine that reflects both the chef's formal training at great restaurants as well as the high quality food that the midwest has to offer.

Parking via pay lots/structures is available."}
{"text":"For our first anniversary my husband surprised me with reservations to one of the few restaurants in Madison that I had not yet been to, despite talking about doing so for *years*.  I was absolutely blown away.  L'Etoile exceeded our expectations in a multitude of ways.

I had read many reviews on this restaurant, and the most common complaint as far as I can tell is that the service was uptight.  I would certainly have to disagree.  Our server went out of his way to make sure we were having a magical evening, and communicated the dishes to us beautifully, as if you weren't already excited to try what was just put in front of you, his descriptions of the dish were mouthwatering.  

We did the seven course menu, and it was absolute divinity.  Each course was creative, thoughtful, and balanced; and the portions were perfect.  Whoever complains about their \"petite\" portion sizes either has no experience with upscale fine dining, or chose to go ala-carte and didn't order more than one dish.  I left feeling very full and extremely satisfied.  I have been raving about this place to everyone I know ever since. 

At the end of our meal, we were given a tasting menu to take home with us that had been printed \"Happy First Anniversary\".  The manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was perfect (it was).  Having been blown away at Tory Miller's other restaurants, I naturally expected great things, and L'Etoile absolutely delivered.  Between the flawless staff, the stunning Capitol view, and an unforgettable dinner, I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm happy to get on board with those who rave about L'Etoile. It was delicious and special. Of all the things you could splurge on, it rates a high return on investment."}
{"text":"I went to L'Etoile with my parents and girlfriend. They were relatively busy, but we still received adequate attention from the server. Everything is locally sourced. The sungold tomatoes associated with the summer squash risotto were the stars of the dish - luckily the server was able to provide the name of the local farm that sells these on the square for the farmer's market (not naming the farm as my parents wants these sungold tomatoes). My girlfriend had the Roasted Branzino despite her worries of it being too heavy.  The Branzino was cooked perfectly and not overly heavy for a hot summer day.  As it was a hot day, I went with the Braised Monkfish.  The dish was excellent but it was unsuspectingly heavy. In general the portions were huge for a French restaurant and the prices were not too bad (especially since we had been in NYC for dinners recently). However, L'Etoile did not measure up to the best of NYC restaurants that we have frequented.  Nonetheless, this was probably the best meal I have ever had in Madison (sorry Mom)."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal there last weekend. Had a group of six and service was painfully slow...over 3 hours for 4 courses.  Service very poor for a James Beard winner...in fact, of the 30+ Beard restaurants I've been to, this was the worst.

Examples including pouring our red before our white without asking.  Not mentioning the two bottle max on two occasions...both with initial reservation and a later confirmation.  What floored me is that I confirmed a change in our party and confirmed the corkage policy and the hostess never mentioned the max...I guess it the customer's responsibility to ask such things in their mind.  In addition, we had printed out the wine list and never saw a corkage policy online...if it is there, we couldn't find it.

Sturgeon was overcooked shoe leather.  Balance of meal was probably a 3 on a scale of 5.

My entire party agreed that they wouldn't return as we had much better service at other Madison restaurants.  Sister restaurant Graze...completely different experience...great service and great food...much quicker and for less money."}
{"text":"Most expensive restaurant in Madison, but well worth it for a celebratory meal. Literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Steak was as good as advertised. Fancy decor with glass windows."}
{"text":"It is difficult to praise L'etoile too highly. Not only are the ingredients fresh (America's best and largest farmer's market is held every Saturday literally across the street), given the abundance available, they are also excellently sourced. Since we shop at the farmer's market whenever we are in town, we have come to know the raw ingredients L'etoile uses to such good effect.

For instance, the beef exclusively comes from Fountain Prairie....and if you know anything about WI beef, you know this bodes extremely well for the flavorfulness of your carppaccio or dry aged ribeye (the latter is justly famous). Likewise, the butter is house churned (!!) Sassy Cow Creamery milk. You will fantasize about this butter for weeks. I could go on and on about the beans and the beets and blueberries...and, well, you get the point.

That is why we drive from Chicago to eat here: the opportunity to really connect with the farmers and artisans of WI. While the food is excellent and would deserve praise anywhere else, the focus on helping you discover your local farmer and fresh food is what really sets this place apart.

And if the atmosphere is too stuffy for you, strike up a conversation about the food with the waitstaff. The conversation is guaranteed to humanize the experience and you may just leave knowing something about heirloom tomato cultivation in central WI."}
{"text":"AVERAGE.  NOT WORTH IT.  A NOTCH ABOVE OLIVE GARDEN!
Maybe its' cause I'm from Chicago, but I have better restaurants blocks from my house - at half the price.  I do not care about spending money - if the food is great, but this was . . below great?    C'mon, Madison, I know you've got more than this?
Are you Yelpers cuckoo???

starter, dried out, mini-biscuit tasted just like a Goldfish cracker (not in a good way)
amuse bouche - parsnip soup - good little combo of subtle flavors
$15 first course - Korean stew - AWFUL! I kept asking her what was in the broth bc it tasted like a salty, oily, can of condensed soup. She said, \"Korean hot sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, and sesame oil.  One - these are all things I can put together at home, but Two, I SHOULD NOT just mix together and call it a broth.  No depth of flavor whatsoever. 
$44 Red Snapper- tasty, but very basic.  I cook make this myself.  Greens were way too salty and came with oily potatoes 
$56 Rib Eye - LOTS OF FAT. Again, decent flavor on the steak, but nothing that anyone can't do at home.  Came with spinach, which tasted like . . spinach.
They served bread and butter, which tasted like . . uh bread and butter.
$10 chocolate cake was decent, but the little tray of sweets they brought at the end, just made them look worse.  Popcorn, truffles, and something else.  Truffles were disgustingly sweet (Fannie May is better and I hate Fannie May) and popcorn? Please! overly sweet and just gross. 
I hate to write this, but I felt gypped!  Server was nice, but disappeared for an hour and I had to flag some other lady down to get a dessert menu.  Timing was long between some of the courses as well. 
Never again
Why did this guy get an award?  Did they eat at this place first?  Do not understand."}
{"text":"The food is as elegantly presented as the bright naturally-lit space, and despite what you might expect from a room with floor-to-ceiling windows, the daytime ambiance transitions nicely into an equally intimate and romantic evening. There is so much attention to detail here that makes dining at L'Etoile a very special experience, including the special filtered water they serve which has a barely noticeable and very pleasant effervescence to it. 

My dining companions had great luck with their dishes, but unfortunately my quail was a bit dry and definitely over salted for my tastes. The desserts were beautifully presented, but did not match the sophistication or delicacy of other parts of the meal. For example, the gelato we ordered was swimming in a sticky sweet fudge sauce and the three of us were unable to finish it. I would not recommend coming here for dessert. 

Definitely take advantage of the suggested wine pairings if you plan on having any wine with your food - they know what they're doing here. Overall, I had a great experience and I am glad I tried this place."}
{"text":"Wow.  The food is DIVINE.  I haven't experienced flavors that intense in years.  I would've given it 5 stars, except the atmosphere is way too stuffy for me.  Really expensive great food doesn't mean it can't have a more fun atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Amazing. My boyfriend and I had the 7 course dinner with wine pairing. Everything was presented well, the food was beautiful and every wine couldn't have paired better. There were two courses I would've had an entire meal out of. The foie gras dish was hands down my favorite. Kudos to the staff that knew so much about every detail and had an answer to every question. Would definitely visit here again!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to L'Etoile for my birthday, because he knows how much I love fine dining. Coming from Europe I miss that experience of top chef cuisine, dishes that melt in your mouth, creative combinations prepared to perfection. In a restaurant, the quality of food comes first, then the atmosphere,  then the service, and then of course the price.

Well..... how should I start .... not a bad atmosphere, great views at the square, for premium restaurant a jazz duo or a pianist somewhere on a side would have been nice. Service was little slow, but alright (plates weren't cleared immediately).  But the food.... When I read through the menu, nothing really sounded too appetizing to me. Not a good selection of meats, a lot of components, that didn't complement each other in any way. I still wasn't ready to throw the towel and was still hoping to be wowed, once I'd order.

Don't remember the fancy names, but to put it simple, I had a duck ragout on a slice of white sour dough bread as a first course, corn chowder with scallops as the midcourse and finally sturgeon as the entree. 

In regard to duck ragout, it tasted overcooked and bland, missing any kind of zest or structure. The berry sauce on the side of the plate was extremely sweet, almost like or rather exactly as simple jam. 

The corn chowder was excellent (this is why I am giving 2 stars). Besides scallops there were other components (might have been calamari pieces?) that made the dish and every bite interesting.

The sturgeon  - great fish, was made tasty and juicy. But the unpleasantly crispy rice squeezed into a  triangle, and the incredibly salty soy sauce (honestly, appeared to me like soy and salt only) completely spoiled the dish.

Organic and fresh ingredients are always welcome on my plate, but it's not enough to make a dish great. The 5-star prizes ($40 for a rather small portion of sturgeon, $16 for duck bruschetta) were not justified by any means. If I want to spend so much money on food, I do expect excellence! Overall my experience with L'Etoile was disappointing and I would not go there again other than to maybe get a cocktail and enjoy the views.

The only way how I can explain why this restaurant is still rather popular ad not out of business, is because 1. of the location and 2. the residents of Madison including myself are desperate for an upscale  fine dining experience. It is definitely remaining a market niche and I can't wait for someone to fill it one day. Until then - c'est la vie!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. My absolute favorite restaurant in madison and with good reason. The dinners I've had here are the ones I dream about. And Chef Tory's commitment to locally produced, sustainable foods is the icing on top of never-ending deliciousness."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to L'Etoile and our first in the elegant new roomy space. I think they have improved, as this was the most memorable meal yet. Nice windows. The amuse bouche raita-like cold soup with asparagus and pumpkin seeds was OK. The beef tongue salad was very good, very deeply-flavored, and the octopus salad was also nice, the big chunks of octopus surprisingly tender (brined, according to the server). Midcourse was the boudin blanc, basically a house-made bratwurst redolent of morels and ramps, nestled in creamy truffled potato mash and drizzled with a mustardy brown sauce. The truffle shavings option was an awesome add. My wife had the salmon in broth with various vegetables, and I had the brined sliced pork chop, kind of like ham, with a tasty little savory flan and a slice of pheasant pate. Went well with a Malbec. Dessert was a berry cheesecake. We always enjoy this restaurant and view it as a special occasion, which you have to, as it's pretty pricey. But you never feel ripped off. Everything is lovingly crafted and presented, very professional, and of course supportive of artisan producers. (Don't even try to compare it to the Immigrant Restaurant in Kohler, similarly priced but an emperor with no clothes located in a windowless basement.) Worth a trip to Madison which is a nice town."}
{"text":"I was a little bit disappointed with L'Etoile. I mean, I did get a decent meal and by all means recommend it if you can afford it. But for the amount of money I dropped on this meal - more than I've ever spent on any meal in my entire life - I expected nothing short of perfection. What I got was just...good.

To start, the service was weak and unprofessional. Our waitress did not approach our table until fifteen minutes after we were seated, and she didn't appear to be very talented at her job. That is, she could be a little too talkative at times and yet she made herself very difficult to find when she was needed. She by no means was the worst waitress I've had, but this clearly isn't your stereotypical \"snooty Frenchman waiting on you hand and foot\" experience. I would figure a place like this can afford to hire the cream of the crop in service staff.

And the food was really good! But it wasn't great. My main course (scallops) was alright, but not worth the triple cost I paid for them when compared against many seafood restaurants. Same goes for the pumpkin and squash dishes.

I really, truly enjoyed the (not French) onion soup and that has to be the most memorable experience for me at this restaurant. It takes a lot of talent to bring a soup up to that kind of silky consistency and it was so absolutely packed with flavor that I had to work at in very small sips. I also appreciated the chef constantly sending out amuse-boches to keep us happy between courses.

If there's a carpaccio plate on the menu when you choose to come here, don't pass it up. I don't think you could find anywhere else in town that could prepare the dish with such skill and originality. I ordered a paper-thin bison carpaccio with onion crisps and a salad on top that combined to make a flavor that was just out of this world.

Dessert? I don't even remember it. The one cocktail we bought was too overpowering to taste like much other than whiskey.

Overall, due to the restrictive cost this place is only for very special occasions. But for the price I'm paying I expect way more than a series of hit-or-misses and I'd be much better off spending this kind of money in a place like Chicago. L'Etoile's got very few competitors in the gourmet restaurant game in Madison and it really does show."}
{"text":"We decided to splurge and go to L'Etoile for my birthday, especially since Chef Tory just won the Iron Chef competition.  It was everything we expected.  A beautiful table by the window reflecting the city at night.  We did the a la carte menu and each had the appetizer, main dish and dessert.  Each course WAS presented like a painting on a canvas, and tasted delicious.  Highly recommended for that special night out."}
{"text":"We got the tasting menu (no wine pairings). The amuse was amazing (never knew I liked cottage cheese). Loved the octopus appetizer (could have used a few more on the plate) and the agnolotti was perfectly cooked. I had the tenderloin as the main course and although slightly overdone, was gone in about 5 minutes. I've had better crumble but this one was perfectly acceptable. The service was top-notch. You could really tell the server had a passion for the food."}
{"text":"This place has been wonderful to return to time and again.  The menu changes with the available local produce.  The wine pairings are spot on, and the service is extremely attentive!  This is how a restaurant should be run!"}
{"text":"Absolute love this place! I went here once with a date, and it was a grand experience. They didn't have bread for starting which is peculiar. However, they give you these delicious small samples in between your meal. The courses change, because they really want to focus on the quality of the food. 

Service was exceptional where they were very knowledgeable and didn't bug me and my date. The atmosphere was very romantic and relatively peaceful. I really like the setup where everything wasn't too close also. I deifnitely would recommend this place if you're in a serious relationship or a very important business dinner. Also, a lot of wine choices!

Only down side would be the bill, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"We were in town to visit family for Labor Day weekend and decided to treat ourselves out.  The dining room is beautiful, our service was great, and food was good, but what really pushes the experience over the top are the cocktails... I've been to L'etoile numerous times and after each experience, I always leave extolling the drinks... this time, it was the Pushing up Daisies and AB Negative cocktails.  The mixologist is brilliant!"}
{"text":"Really good brunch menu. The weight staff is friendly and the view of the capitol building through the huge windows is breath-taking!"}
{"text":"We have dined at L'Etoile many times over a 20 year period and have always had a wonderful time with excellent, often inspired, food, and very good service.  The ambience was refined and added to the quality of the experience.  We dined at the new L'Etoile last week and had a thoroughly disappointing experience.

We were seated at a round booth table without a tablecloth in a location cut off from diners in the front and upstairs dining areas.  The booth table was reminiscent of corner booth tables at Perkins!  The server had to ask a couple of diners to hand plates to her because she could not reach over the expanse to get the plate.  To make matters worse, when asked why the table had no cloth, she responded that management was considering removing tablecloths from all tables for ecological reasons and because laundry often returned cloths without stains thoroughly removed.

With the exception of a couple of mid-courses and a cheesecake dessert, all diners felt the food was not up to previous standards.  The third courses were remarkable for lack of memorable flavor and the pasta with seafood was bland and flavorless.  The market cut ribeye came out as a very large slab of meat sprinkled with a few frites.  There was little that was subtle about the dish.  The amuse, a liquified cottage cheese concoction, was the flavor highlight of the meal.  

The food was memorable for lack of flavor, the service was adequate and somewhat perfunctory and the ambience was terrible due to the table.  We will probably give L'Etoile another try because of our history of excellent dining experiences there.  But it will not be for a very long time."}
{"text":"A beautiful experience. I took my wife here for our first wedding anniversary and it was wonderful. I've been to Michelin star winning restaurants around the world and this place is on that same level. We each had the seven course tasting menu with wine pairing and everything was exquisite. Make no mistake, this place is very expensive but for a special occasion there isn't a better place in Madison or Wisconsin at which to celebrate."}
{"text":"I see myself as someone that takes a certain amount of pride in knowing food. My review list shows, i think, that I have had some great meals, including Joel Robuchon, Rick Bayless,etc. Whenever I travel, I always like to try the \"best\" restaurants in wherever town I'm in at the moment. The Yelp reviews led me to expect a great meal at L'Etoile--perhaps not Joel Robuchon great, but something truly above the norm. What I got were plates of seriously imbalanced flavors, some weak wine choices, and mediocre service. For my starter, I had the Honeycrisp apple and duck confit. The apple was so powerful and sweet that I really had no idea what else was on the plate. The duck confit could have been canned tuna for all I could tell, my palate was so overwhelmed with apple. To top it off, it was paired with a dreadfully sweet rose that simply emphasized how out of balance the dish was. This was followed with the beef tongue mid-course which was OK, but thinly slicing the beef tongue tends to result in overcooking, which happened here. Given how rich/fatty tongue can be, I was shocked it was paired with a sweet sav blanc, which did nothing to cut though the richness at all. I actually had to refuse the pairing and suggested something more appropriate, a Grüner Veltliner. My main, a lamb dish with a Mediterranean spin on it, was easily the best part of the meal and the red pairing with it was fine. My service was generally solid--the wine steward was very patient and put up with my wine fussing better than many would, but my servers were pretty anonymous and did not stand out at all. Then the check arrived. While I have paid larger checks, $130+ before the tip for one person was out of balance given what I ate and drank. For a point of comparison, I paid LESS for tasting menus with wine at John Besh's August & Hubert Keller's Fleur D'Lys, both restaurants with international reputations for amazing food. Perhaps L'Etoile is, in fact, the best food in Madison, but the only thing comparable here to the better restaurants in the nation are the prices."}
{"text":"A-mazing, but pricey. The fiancee and I went with her parents who generously offered to pay and said, \"Order whatever you'd like.\" Not to take advantage of their offer too much, I had the amuse bouche to start, the \"drunken\" wild Gulf shrimp midcourse, and an amazing seafood pasta dish for dinner. I paired it with an incredible Cabernet Sauvignon. The fiancee and her parents all loved their dishes as well, but I can't remember what everyone had ...

The service was impeccable but not overbearing. It was wasn't overly crowded while we were there (most people were at Concerts on the Square), so it wasn't overly loud.

Speaking of Concerts on the Square, I made our dinner reservation through OpenTable, and the restaurant called me around noon the day of our 7:30 dinner to suggest that we leave extra time for parking and traffic because of the concert. Talk about customer service!

And finally, as a little bonus, at the top of the menu was the message, \"L'Etoile welcomes the Hurwitz Party.\" Very nice touch, though I did have a small pang of guilt for the 4 sheets of paper used for the 10 minutes of deciding what to eat for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if my experience was different from others since I visited for an event, but we were able to taste many hors d'oeuvres and then selected from a three course dinner menu right on the spot. I will give this restaurant major credit for that, because that requires immense preparation and planning. They had to be fully stocked to serve all guests any combination of the menu items! 

Let me start by saying I loved the drinks. They were brilliant and the bartenders really knew what they were doing. 

As all the guests were mingling, the hors d'oeuvres were passed out, and this is when I noticed the repetition of many items that a lot of us didn't care for - there were quite a few exotic meats and \"rare\" foods that just seemed way too \"adventurous.\" I'm putting these adjectives in quotes because it could be that my palate is not as expansive as some who are used to such flavors. But from my perspective, there were too many misses. The foie gras tasted gamey and honestly gross, and then we were served a crab apple, which I followed with a huge sip of my drink to eliminate the aftertaste - sour as one would imagine a crab apple, but also with bitter notes. I really wondered why they decided that would be a solid item to showcase right before our meal. 

On to the first course - I ordered a pear salad, which I absolutely loved. The presentation was spectacular, which was also the case for the steak, my next course and entree. I thought they did a great job here, and the blending of ingredients like the vegetables and purees was excellent. I've learned to always order steak in the Midwest, and I haven't been let down yet!

The dessert was a home run! As we had with our other courses, my table tasted a bit of each other's desserts. I loved the chocolate option the best. Very artfully put together! 

Overall, a very pretty restaurant for a special occasion if you have an adventurous palate."}
{"text":"What a great experience!!!!   Had the multi-course tasting menu.   I have been to a few Michelin starred restaurants that go down the localvore route and most are pretty disappointing because they are not very authentic.   L'Etoile truly gets it.   They don't have a menu that is constant (and switched over every couple of months), it changes based on what is available to be foraged locally daily.   I have been foraging in the area since I was a boy and can tell you that the products that were on the menu and positioned as foraged were 100% appropriate for the geo / season.   Authenticity is table stakes for me for a great experience, what they did with the ingredients is what put the experience over the top.   The creativity in the dishes was impressive, as was the execution.  (Additionally, they were not so dogmatic about local ingredients that they didn't bring in some non-local ingredients to put together outstanding dishes when appropriate.)

Only two minor nits:
1) The food was thoughtfully local, but the drinks were not.   This is not an issue exclusively with this joint, but it always seems strange to me that places like this will source drinks from around the world to compliment locally sourced food ingredients.   I can maybe understand that wine needs to move beyond WI for quality reasons, but there are plenty of world class WI beers that could be served.   The beer list was limited and unimaginative.
2) Torn as to whether to call this out.   The beef course was my favorite dish of the night, but unfortunately, my wife's dish had a faint taste of dish rag infused in it, which definitely ruined that particularly dish for her."}
{"text":"Overhyped, overrated, and overpriced.

I think these three words are pretty accurate when describing L'Etoile. Sure, the food here is great. There's no denying that. But how does it stack up to other fine dining restaurants? The three stars on Yelp equivocates to \"A-OK\", and that's exactly how I feel about it.

I've had the four course meal option at L'Etoile. The first and second course menu items are indeed fancy and I commend the chef for that. But the main entrees are not as original and hence, significantly overpriced. In addition, the portions are smaller than expected. Anything under a four course meal would leave a normal man still hungry and unsatisfied afterwards. 

I do think that L'Etoile is as good as fine dining gets in Madison, but it definitely isn't worth the $$$$ price tag you'll have to pay."}
{"text":"The food is undoubtedly delicious, but they are very pushy. The service was pretty awful; the waiter kept on pushing us to pair our wines even though we said we didnt want to. Just be careful if you go with a specific budget in mind to not get sucked into more by pressure."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar tonight and it was pretty good food.  The bar seats had very uncomfortable back rests.  The service was good.  I ordered the Grouper with BBQ shrimp.  The grouper was well cooked and seasoned.  The shrimp was extremely salty.  The corn risotto was very good and unique.

Ended the meal with a creme brulee.  Very good.

FYI....if you do not order desert they still bring you a few tiny sweets to end the meal.

I had a glass of champagne, the grouper and the desert and my bill was $92 including tip for myself.

A bit pricey and next time I'm going to try Graze which is next door and looks more casual and more affordable."}
{"text":"Earlier this month, I celebrated my birthday in L'Etoile. As a foodie and local food supporter, I have heard so many good words about this place. I have been wanting to try it out during my 5 years in Madison. We finally made the move this year. 

I came out the restaurant being somewhat disappointed. 

Don't get me wrong. Everything was fancy. The staff was very professional. The ambiance was really classy. Food was delicate. 

 I come in with full preparation of the steep price (otherwise I would not wait for 5 years). However, I can hardly justify the experience with the $90 per person bill. It is pretty clear to me that L'Etoile is overpriced. 

In terms of food, 4 of us got Charcuterie, Pork Belly, and another beets dish for appetizers. They are all good, but without any true highlight. The portion is smallish. After I ate the pork belly, I somewhat really missed the pork belly I had in the A Pig in the Fur Coat...

I had Branzino for entree. The fish itself was pretty delicious, but standard. The vegetables on the side has a slight hint of brunt smell that I found pretty odd. 

My brother and his girlfriend had lamb rack and scallop. Very average dish that you can get in an upscale restaurant. 

The biggest trouble of the night came with the steak for my wife. Since she is pregnant, she could not take raw meat. Therefore she asked the steak to be medium-well, but the steak came on the table being medium-rare. She had to ask the kitchen to re-do her plate. I guess such thing always happens but I was not expecting in L'Etoile. 

For dessert, we shared a Creme Boulee. It was, again, very average and with too much cream on the top. 

I could not find a memorable dish from the dinner. The food was delicious, but it failed to surprise me. When I pay close to a hundred dollar per person for a dinner, I really hope to see something more exciting. 

Nor do I understand the numerous 5-star reviews for this restaurant. Maybe this is something not meant to be enjoyed by poor students. Overall, classy, delicate, but somehow empty and overpriced. Thus a 3 stars."}
{"text":"C'est vraiment un endroit à éviter jadis c'était très bon cependant maintenant ça laisse à désirer."}
{"text":"As intimate and romantic as it gets. The restaurant interior is really beautiful and the food is no different. The service is very professional and everyone was attentive. You're paying for the high quality ingredients and service. I think the food taste could have been slightly better for the price, but you can definitely tell the ingredients are top notch."}
{"text":"This chief has really shown his colors. A perfectly prepared Rabbit pate and Red Snapper with an Asian flair to rival many Manhattan chiefs. Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"Wow. We received a gift card for a wedding gift almost a year ago and finally got the chance to use it. What can I say? The food is absolutely magnificent. I did the tasting menu and my husband did two apps and a entree. Out of all 9 dishes, two were good but not as good as the others. That's because 7/9 were mind blowing. They start us off with this mouse that has so many flavors. The bread is fresh and local with whipped butter. Yum. Presentation was on point. All the food is local which is amaze balls! Drinks are expensive. Go here when you have two hours and want to make the night special. It's pricey but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Not just good food and good service.... Very good food and very good service! L'Etoile consistently kicks out creative dishes whose flavors are both complex and complimentary. They constantly change their menu to feature seasonal specials guaranteeing you can visit at least four times a year and be pleasantly surprised. In my opinion this is one of the top five restaurants in Madison"}
{"text":"Rule number ONE, seasoning! All my dishes were under seasoned. Also, either the main course was good and garnish was bad or garnish was bad and the main course was good.

I do not mind paying for an exceptional meal but this place is not worth $400. Incomparable to Gary Danko, Alexander's Steakhouse, and Manresa which is around the same price. Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"With 212 Yelp reviews already, I'm a little late to the L'Etoile review party! I really loved the food and my experience at L'Etoile. I feel that it could be deserving of 5 stars, but I have a few minor complaints. 

First things first. L'Etoile is different because:
You don't eat dinner -- you're on a culinary adventure. Everything at L'Etoile is about the food. The menu is vague, so the server describes the dishes in great detail with lots of fun adverbs and adjectives. The server later points out and explains each ingredient of the dish when the food arrives at the table. The food is delicious. The flavors are so interesting and foreign because this isn't like cooking at home and this isn't like any other restaurant.

Pros:
- The staff people are EXTREMELY accommodating. The host was warm and inviting, our server was very friendly and attentive, and the other staff people who came to our table for some reason or another were also very personable. L'Etoile's staff make you feel like you're royalty when you are their customer. When our server asked if we were celebrating anything and told her it was our anniversary, she offered a champagne toast on the house.
- The food is incredible. With every bite of every dish I tried, I found myself noticing the sweet flavor, the salty flavor, the citrus/bright flavor, the earthy flavor, the softness, the crunch, and the list goes on. (Yes, all in a single bite.) The manner in which L'Etoile puts together the ingredients based on complementary and contrasting flavors and textures is beyond anything I've ever experienced at a restaurant before.
- The food presentation is superb. The food that shows up at your table at L'Etoile is so pretty that you almost don't want to eat it!
- The extra little dishes are nice. Since this was my first time dining at L'Etoile, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy extra bites throughout the meal that I didn't order. We received extra small cheese/asparagus appetizers and extra dessert snacks in addition to the appetizer and dessert dishes we ordered.
 
Cons: 
- The two Ps: portion and price. I know L'Etoile is not Applebee's, but I have to mention the price. I am not a big eater. I can eat a 6 oz. filet of fish and feel full; yet I felt that L'Etoile's portions were very small. While the food was delectable and the presentation beautiful, I felt hungry a few hours later. After an almost $200 price tag, I don't want to be hungry that quickly.
- Dress code: L'Etoile does not have a dress code according to its website. For our dinner, my husband wore a suit, and I wore a black dress with my most uncomfortable but most classy d'orsay pumps. Other guests were also wearing formal clothes. But what about the guy two tables down wearing a hoodie, baggy jeans and dirty sneakers? It's only natural that when you're dressed to the nines, you notice the very under-dressed guy in the restaurant. For what is considered the most upscale and the priciest restaurant in the entire city, L'Etoile not having a dress code seems strange to me.

Will I return? Probably, but only for another dinner celebration when splurging is the objective. For random birthdays or just a nicer-than-usual dinner out when we're in the mood, my vote still goes to Graze."}
{"text":"This place is the incarnation of the Platonic form of the Fine Dining Restaurant. As a big-city restaurant snob, I came to this place (at their old location) about seven years ago, expecting to be polite with my local friends. I was amazed, and my amazement has only grown over the years even as they moved to the new location. Where to begin? With the FOOD, of course, which starts with mostly locally sourced ingredients of the highest quality (MIchael Pollan loves this place too). The chef is a genius. I can still remember dishes from past years with tears in my eye (agnolotti with lamb balls, I love you! -- but I haven't forgotten you, Mr. Pheasant, or you, Bison steak!). The sommelier has a real knack for selecting superb wines through their supplier that sell for reasonable menu prices; if you are willing to spend $50-$100 on a bottle of wine you will not be disappointed. They are also really good at pairing wines, and you can do that more economically and for an even better dining experience. The wine list is so good, by the way, that I take it with me to wine stores as a guide. The service is impeccable; it is all done wonderfully and without fanfare. Finally, the atmosphere of the new place is excellent. There is a gorgeous view of the capitol and the square and the interior has the feel of a classy restaurant in New York but you're right there in Wisconsin, eating Wisconsin products from farmers who can be seen visiting the restaurant on their anniversaries. Remy would be proud!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals that I've had in a while! Perfect service from the personalized menu to the enthusiastic descriptions of each ingredient in the dishes. And the view! Delightful. Even the cocktails were great! We asked the bartender to be creative, based on our taste, and he nailed it. I love a good bartender!

Since the menu changes often, I would say just order whatever is in season. When we went, it was sauteed ramps with crispy sorrel mushrooms topped with a runny duck egg. Perfection. The carpaccio was also delicious, they managed to elevate that simple dish to divine perfection with micro greens and a delicate delicious sauce. 

For our main course, we shared the seafood pasta, which was bucatelli with crab, fish... and some other seafood, but with each morsel cooked absolutely just right, and coated in delicate sauce that accented, without overwhelming the dish. 

I'm not a huge dessert person, but they did a pretty great Creme Brulee and an awesome white chocolate mousse with some sort of berry sorbet. The petit fours were also great. All around, delightful meal."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in town.  Enough can't be said about their amazing food.  Truly fine dining."}
{"text":"Great experience. Could have done without the explicit and detailed hard sell on how they raised that night's special, the tender veal served with foie gras, but otherwise wonderful."}
{"text":"Went for my partner's birthday:

-fantastic wine pairings
-mention a birthday or special occasion when making a reservation
-fantastic service

I have also enjoyed apps & drinks at the bar; great place to start a night out."}
{"text":"I'll give four stars for the food and one star for service.  We arrived at 7:05 and I liked the rooms, large, airy, with very nicely spaced tables.  However, after we were seated, it was like we were invisible even though the restaurant wasn't even close to being half full.  What was odd was that the lady who sat us told us a waiter would be with us shortly only to find out that she was our waiter.  I only found out who our waiter was because I asked the manager, \"who is our waiter?\"  I was able to put in an order for two champagne cocktails with him.  This was around 7:20.  At 7:25, two glasses of champagne came out and I had to send them back for champagne cocktails.  Sometime around 7:35 our cocktails FINALLY came out.  It took us 30 minutes to get our drink!  This is absolutely unacceptable in a restaurant where the average main course is $48.  This is a huge NO-NO in fine dining and set the mood.  I actually suggested to my dining partner that we finish our cocktail and get the heck out of there.  I was in the process of checking YELP to find something within arms reach where we could get a bite to eat when our waitress came to place our order.
My dining partner looked at me and suggested, \"let's just try it\" so I mistakenly agreed.  We each ordered a starter and a main course along with a lovely bottle of 2009, Vincent Giradin Puligny Montrachet; something to really look forward to.  We were nursing our champagne cocktails, waiting for our bottle of wine to come out when the waiter comes out with our fist courses BEFORE bringing our bottle of wine.  When you're dropping loot on a great bottle, you better bring it out before the food comes.  This was another huge, inexcusable mistake, you can't do this!  I told them to take the dishes away and go get the wine.  They then came out and hurriedly opened the bottle and quickly brought back the same plates.  Now we're left with two champagne cocktails, have drunk, have a wonderful bottle of wine in front of us with our first courses which we wanted to enjoy with our wine but didn't want to waste the cocktails.  Just terrible timing, something I wouldn't expect to happen anywhere but would tolerate in some place that charges 15 bucks for a plate, not $50.  
By this point, we could only take solace in the excellent wine but giggled to ourselves about how terrible the front of the house ran.  The food was tasty but was overshadowed by these series of events.  The bottom line is that if you're going to brand yourselves as a high end, white table cloth dining experience, the service needs to match the food and the price and is simply doesn't here, they're not even halfway there, IMO."}
{"text":"So this will now be my wife and I's new \"our place\" now that we live in Madison. 

Excellent food, phenomenal service. 

The a la carte menu had several wonderful options, and as someone with a dairy allergy, the chef was more than helpful in adjusting preparations to meet my dietary needs. This includes creating a finishing course especially for me so I could indulge with my wife. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Dang, guys.  SIX stars. The watermelon kimchee with crispy pork belly, frisee and spiced cashews was the all-time most delicious thing I'd ever put in my mouth.  Until I tasted the wild mushroom hash topped with a perfect duck egg and sweet onion confit.  Until I tasted the perfectly prepared truffled sea bass with leek fondue (whoa) and celeriac.  A sweet brown sugar pavlova topped with broiled peaches, homemade ice cream and fresh berries was an elegant and lovely way to finish the very best meal I've ever eaten. 
Hot tip: Do your palate a favor and let them pair the wines for you.  Michael, the wine director, is friendly, knowledgeable and a genius at what he does. He answered my questions with seeming delight for both the wines and the conversation.  
The service was incredibly attentive, but in a professional (read: not phony) and non-intrusive way. 

This is the place to go.  It is not cheap, but neither are you. Treat yourself."}
{"text":"L'Etoile is one of the best restaurants in the world. The wait staff treats diners like they are royalty (and I can be VERY picky and demanding). And the food is divine. The whole thing is a memorable and delightful experience. This restaurant is one of the very first in the nation to do seasonal menus and was at the forefront of the farm to table trend. The location is beautiful. I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant. It's expensive for sure, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent locally sourced food. Quite expensive but well worth it. For all menu items, the source of the ingredients is listed. They also give you small tastings between courses, a tiny cup of soup or an amuse bouche. 
Their desserts, made from fresh fruit, tend to be excellent so save room."}
{"text":"Delicious branzino (which isn't easy to find in Madison). And they know what they're doing as far as service goes. Would definitely recommend for special occasions. Not sure it's worth the cost though. The food wasn't that much more impressive than Graze next door."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous dinner!  

Minus the long wait at the bar for our pre-dinner drinks, this was a perfect evening from start to finish.  My husband and I came here for a romantic dinner while visiting Madison over the weekend.  We had the 4-course tasting menu.  Our server was amazing at describing the menu offerings in detail and the pace of the service was very good.  Everything was beautifully presented, but there were a few distinct winners of the night.  The gnocchi with blue cheese and an apple cider reduction was tender and delicious.  The bison tenderloin served atop loaded mashed potatoes was nearly the best cut of meat I've ever tasted.  Desserts were also superb.  I had the chocolate pate with chocolate orange biscotti and cocoa sorbet.  So rich, I actually left some on the plate!  My husband had the seasonal pumpkin mousse cake with an unbelievable pumpkin cream sauce.

The view of the Capitol and surrounding area outside the tall glass walls was very pretty and the dining room was elegantly decorated with simple white tablecloths.  There is also an elevated loft area if you choose to have a private group celebration.  This is a pricy night out, but well worth it for a special occasion.  Be sure to get the tasting menu for a phenomenal dining experience."}
{"text":"Last year I gave it 5 stars, this year, 3.  The chef has just gotten lazy - they have gone from a full menu full of fabulous choices to 2 set menus - a 3 Course at $65 (granted, selections within this, but nothing enticed at all...) and a 7 course, all if which sounded delicious, for $125.  Since we are not allowed foie gras in California, I'm on a mission on my yearly visit to Wisconsin...  The usual plan is to sit at the bar and let the excellent and knowledgeable bartenders guide us through wine, drinks and food for dinner 2 nights in a row at L'Etoile, as their fish selections were varied and always wonderful.  Usually only one incredible foie gras starter, but the helpful Bartenders would have a word and the chef would create something new, different and exciting for our return the next night to accompany one of the other fish dishes we were dying to try...  That is no longer possible with this set menu.  I'm normally all for Prix fix, IF you have a choice of that or the usual menu.  2 Set Menus only?  Not happy, and neither are some of the other regulars we met last night.  

So, onto the menu which granted, we shared, but still incredibly puny portions.  Montauk Grilled Scallops - was one of the teensiest scallop singular I have ever seen sliced into 4 slivers.  Had to put on reading glasses to find its accompaniments and impossible to experience all together.  Foie gras 2 ways and all to myself as husband knows better... - one teensy pear \"cracker\" with buttery heaven on it - would have killed for a bowl of this, a 1\" seared piece in a duck reduction that was very interesting in a good way... Would have killed for more than 3 little bites of this too.  I was able to accompany with a lovely glass of Sauternes, but the foie was gone well before the wine.  Lobster was small but yummy.  Lamb \"Rack\" - ha... Not memorable.  Eye of Rib - again, meh.  Hooks 12 year cheddar with apple - I missed the usual calcium lactate crystals I love to find in the Hooks 12 year, so this was a letdown.  Pumpkin cheesecake was a hit.  Small, but yummy.  Scott,  the bartender, is amazing and would love to have him guide me through wine and drink menus always.  Sad as I loved this place, our yearly 2 nights in a row food feast \"pilgrimage,\" but we're looking elsewhere for tonight.  Highly recommend sitting at the bar though, totally different experience than the tables and you meet amazing people who know their food.  Met the Pleasant Ridge cheese maker last night, one of my favs.  So, after a $125 7 course menu which granted, we split, hit the Tornado and split a $9 beef tenderloin sandwich, which was incredibly satisfying.  Last night reminded me of our dinner at El Bulli, when my husband had to stop for an Iberico and cheese sandwich after 37 courses!  We really aren't that big of eaters, usually split a starter and an entree, but another amusing end to a food feast evening ;-)  L'Etoile, please go back to giving us choices!"}
{"text":"Definitely a top 5 favorite restaurant in Madison for me!  You just can't beat this classy place if you are in the mood for a gourmet meal.  Just be prepared to get out your pocketbook!  Entrees start at about $30 with an average $9 first course.  Call ahead for a reservation and ask about sitting  next to the window.  The second floor view of the capitol is amazing!!  An extensive wine list, but very few wines by the glass.  The staff knows the menu very well and can answer any questions you have.  I had the skate wing which absolutely melted in my mouth and my date had one of the best cuts of beef I've ever tasted...a flat iron grilled steak.  5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"The service here is second to none in this beautiful establishment that clearly is forcing others to raise the bar in Madison for fine dining.  The wine list is fantastic, offering Bordeauxs, off the beaten path malbecs and serving several very nice wines by the glass as well.  The apps were exquisite and brimming with flavor.  We tried the beef tongue carpaccio and were delighted with the presentation and technique.  The risotto was perhaps too oily as was a few other dishes which is why I cannot give this place five stars.  Will be back to give it another try, with the service as good as it gets here, this place has begun to be on a short list of restaurants with real staying power."}
{"text":"A Taste of the State

L'Etoile features farm fresh ingredients from Wisconsin and the taste of the state does not disappoint. From a cheesy amuse (a cheesy flavor that is) to the final cheese plate, every dish featured something good from Wisconsin - and we're talking about much more than just dairy. Organic heirloom veggies & proteins from local farmers are creatively & tastefully combined in every course. The sommelier offered outstanding wine pairings with every dish. The amuse, charcuterie, first course, mid course & cheese sampler all upstaged our entrees - not that the entrees were poor - just a bit one note and slightly large for a five course meal. Our appetites and tastebuds would have been fully sated without them. But we would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Was brought here for a work dinner. The food was great and the place is stunning.

First of all, I loved the floor to ceiling windows facing the Capitol. They make for quite an impressive view and the modern decor of the restaurant takes maximum advantage of it.

The food was great. Every bite was delicious and we had some glorious wine to go with it. I particularly remember a delicious pork belly main course. Perfectly balanced and not heavy at all despite being basically made of pork fat.

Was also nice that the menus were personalized with the name of our party. A little touch, but a nice one.

Recommended for special occasions!"}
{"text":"We only went here on our anniversary every few years because it is pricey. However, the food is spectacular. You may not know exactly what you are ordering, but don't worry, it will be incredible. The owner is also committed to supporting local farmers and suppliers and what he does with the menu is divine. The portions are small and gourmet works of art, but this is fine dining at its finest and your mouth will be very happy. Savor each bite."}
{"text":"I'm not drinking the L'Etoile Kool-Aid.  I have yet to have a good meal here; even the foie gras is poorly cooked.  For a restaurant that is billed as \"Madison's Best,\" this can't compare with an average bistro in Quebec.  And comparing it to a real french restaurant in the US is silly.  Anyone who thinks this is as good as Bouley or Daniel in NYC, L'Espalier in Boston, TRU in Chicago, or Sanford in Milwaukee must come from another planet or has donated their taste buds to science.

This is a mediocre restaurant in a town filled with far too many rotten restaurants.  In a larger city, L'Etoile would go unnoticed and then go out of business.

Lower your expectations and go to the Old Fashioned next door.  Simple food but no unpleasant surprises."}
{"text":"This is probably the fanciest restaurant I have ever been to. Had my friend who decided we were going to check this place out given me a better head's up, I would not have worn my fake Uggs from Target and a cardigan. But I think it was very telling of how wonderful this place is that not one person gave me a dirty look for having a much-too casual look.

The wine selection was fantastic. We had the beet appetizer, octopus appetizer, sea scallops main dish, and meyer lemon tart. Everything was amazing. The presentation was beautiful, and it tasted even better. My favorite was the scallops and the lemon tart. The crust on the lemon tart was just impeccable. 

I will definitely come back...and much better dressed this time!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. Good service, great food. You can see the capital through windows."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and drinks. For an award winning chef, the prices are not outrageous. 

For Wisconsin people will think it's expensive but it's so worth it!! 

The menu changes constantly but my dad loved the lamb. My friend and I got halibut and rock fish, both outrageously delicious."}
{"text":"Would never go back. Our \"wine pairing\" over the first 3 courses was good. Then it just stopped! I asked our server and she said she doesn't do the wine. At 6:30 there were 20 people and still 20 minutes between \"courses\". 2 courses were great but with only a bite per plate hard to tell. So many other places you can go for half the price. Maybe the Chef was on vacation?"}
{"text":"My last few experiences were not what I had hoped, but the new tasting menu is excellent and everything I've always wanted from L'Etoile."}
{"text":"Spectacular.

My parents offered to take me anywhere for graduation, and the decision was a no-brainer--the final \"fancy\" place in Madison I had left to visit...L'Etoile. For graduation weekend, it was a prix fixe dinner, 4 courses with multiple options.

To reiterate: Spectacular.

The \"welcome dish\" was asparagus with whipped cottage cheese, ppepitas and pumpkin seed oil. Absolutely delicious, with gorgeous presentation--the cottage cheese was whipped and had a light, delicious airy quality. Superb.

We all ordered different dishes from each course, and it just seemed to get better and better. The seared pork belly with kimchee, crispy shallots and pork belly? To die for. Beef tenderloin carpaccio? Delicious. Sunchoke and bacon soup? Sublime.

Oh, and that was just the second course. Really.

I could go on and on about each course--you know, the seared sea scallops, NY strip steak, or even the halibut over polenta with escargot...but I guess it'd get pretty repetitious, huh?

I could talk about how good dessert was--the almond bar with chocolate ganache or lavender shortbread with Italian meringue--but it's still not going to change my one-word summary of L'Etoile:

Spectacular."}
{"text":"A great restaurant. Extremely expensive by any standard.

For appetizers we ordered pork belly and a sausage and onion soup. The pork belly was nicely crispy and very fatty, though a little bland considering all of the plate's components. The soup was constructed out of several separately prepared items including an onion red wine reduction, sausage, and a marrow-based thick broth. It was good, but elevated to destination dining by, of all things, the best god danged croutons we've ever tasted. The croutons held strong garlic overtones and were covered with a parmesan crust that was just outasite. 

For entrees we had steak, and wild bass on a ham and cabbage base. The bass was great though it seemed wildly overpriced. The steak was perfectly charred on the outside and perfectly medium rare on the inside. I love steaks in general and this held up to the very best Chicago steakhouse offerings, and in fact surpassed most. Probably in the top 3 I've ever had.

For dessert we ate a 'chocolate cake' which was actually four different (and large) servings of dark chocolate preparation with a caramel iced cream. Best dessert we've ever had anywhere. 

So is the food at L'Etoile worth twice as much as the next-most-expensive-restaurant in Madison? Three of our items, including the unexpected magic crouton (plus steak and dessert), were among the very best we've ever had. The pork belly appetizer cost as much as an entree at Lombardino's, but not as good. Service is fine, nothing too special. Expect to pay upwards of $200 for your meal. Appetizers: 8/10, Entrees: 9/10, Dessert: 10/10"}
{"text":"Very good food, one of the best fine dining restaurants in madison, nay the the Midwest. Small portions, very very expensive, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ate here for a dinner when a few friends were in town a couple of months back. The food was great but the portions were obviously small (inline with the concept, right). As much fun as we had (keeping in mind most of our bill was bottles of wine) sampling their delicious faire- I think there are much better options bang for buck/cuisine wise around town...."}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans and a veteran in the military I would like to think that I know and love food more than most. With that being said this is one of my favorite restaurants in the U.S. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, I highly recommend taking the advice and pair all foods. Their wine selection is above the rest and to top it off I had my first 30 year old cheddar there finely paired with a French champagne. I highly recommend this place and will return here at the next chance I get!"}
{"text":"Came here 2 months ago for my sister's 21st birthday. Probably the best meal I've had in  long time, and I have lived in many large cities where the culinary options are quite plentiful.  
We had the prix fixe menu with bone in rib eye for two with 4 different vegetable sides.  The steak was done perfectly and delicious. The wine pairing was perfect.  Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing.  Overall, a fantastic experience and well worth the price."}
{"text":"It's hard not to give this restaurant 5 stars. It hits the mark on all aspects.  It is expensive but it is worth the cost to experience this place"}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to come to L'Etoile last night to celebrate our 6th anniversary.  It was a very good experience.  The service was excellent...it took a little extra time at the bar to get a cocktail but the bar was crowded.  Once we were seated, we had a lovely table in the front to enjoy the floor to ceiling windows and beautiful view of the Capitol.  

We chose the a la carte menu over the tasting menu- purely subjective.  We also chose the wine pairings.  They were able to let my husband choose his appetizer off the tasting menu which was excellent.  Overall, it was a very good experience...the food was very good- a little short of excellent...hence the 4 stars.  The wine pairings and sommelier were perfect.  We will likely be back for another special occasion."}
{"text":"Proves food is an art! Amazing! Be ready to pull out the bling $$$$$$!"}
{"text":"L'Etoile is elegant and sophisticated without being overtly pretentious. Waitstaff is well-versed on the menu, even though it changes frequently. The view of the Capitol is beautiful, and I love the natural lighting and floor-to-ceiling windows. Considering Tory Miller is an award-winning chef, the prices are not outrageous. My only wish is that the portions were slightly larger, but alas, this is fine dining."}
{"text":"We were one of the first couples to show-up and as such it was empty as they were prepping for the night. It is difficult to get a table on a Friday night, but we booked well ahead. Our server, Frank, was amazing for the entire experience. He was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and knew a good bit about the local area ingredients. Our menus included \"Happy Birthday\" which was a nice touch.

We did the full tasting menu and wine pairings. A few of the pairings were weak in our minds, but pleasant. The wine selections weren't trying too hard and could be picked up at your local store probably. Nothing wrong with that.

The courses were all visually exciting and well done. Everything had its place and was, for the most part, edible and with purpose. Unfortunately some of the dishes had competing flavour profiles that minimised what would have been standout items on their own. For example the shrimp and fried green tomato could have done without the tomato. Each were tasty alone, but together it just took out the uniqueness of their standalone awesomeness. One very enjoyable dish included local cheese and hibiscus. It was phenomenal.

Wife and I, after tips, walked out for about 500 USD. In Madison that is big money for a meal. I can't think of anything else in town that is in the same league so they can get away with it. Compared to other tasting menus we have had it wasn't groundbreaking, but it is on our list of places to visit many more times while in Madison. You would be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable meal around these parts.

The chef takes risks, tries things, and often something magical comes of it. We appreciate the creativeness on the plate."}
{"text":"L'Etoile is one of the elite, if not the very best restaurant in Madison.  The food, service, and presentation are all exceptional.  The seasonal menu and use of food from many local producers ensures that their menu stays fresh and exciting.  Everything I've eaten here has been amazing.  I simply cannot say enough good things about L'Etoile."}
{"text":"I have always given L'Etoile 5 stars, until now.  You can go to many restaurants in Madison for fine dining, but L'Etoile was the only place in Madison to go for a dining experience.  Six or seven FULL courses spread out over 2 and a half hours.  Waiters and Waitresses who explained the farm to table detail of each course you were eating.  If you are a foodie, L'Etoile WAS different.  My disappointment has come with the new tasting menu structure.  Seven courses for $125.00 and you get no choices.  You get what you get.  Portions are ridiculously small because they are a TASTE.  If you don't care for a course or two, I guess you'll have to stop at McDonalds on the way home.  We were told we could do the 3-course a la carte if we still wanted choices.  I don't come to L'Etoile for 3-courses, I can go anywhere for that, I come to L'Etoile for something special.  We used to enjoy starting our dinner with a cheese board selection, and that isn't even an option any longer. Service is more chaotic than it used to be at the old building.  We probably had 6 different people serving us food, we never knew who was going to pop over.  Most of them didn't have a clue what they were serving you.  Our original Waiter was wonderful, but got busy with other tables and was lost to us about half-way into our dinner.  With a final tab of $380, I am very saddened by the experience for the first time in 10 years.  Chef Tory Miller may be spreading himself too thin and not concentrating on his mother ship restaurant.  PLEASE bring back the old L'Etoile menu!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly nervous to review this place because I don't think anything I say could encapsulate its super foodie goodness. This high-end joint makes eating an intellectual, sensational and exploratory activity. The chefs and waiters have outdone themselves over and over! Make sure to only come here if you're willing to spend your/your parents' entire life savings on what is basically food art. I can't write any further without maybe starting to cry of happiness remembering this meal. Take a lookie at the pics I posted!"}
{"text":"I'm always surprised there isn't broader consensus that this is the best restaurant in Madison, because it is.  After 15 years here (and in NYC before that) I've eaten everywhere, and this place is a gift.

The kitchen has, miraculously, gotten a hair better (and more creative) since Odessa left.

To those who say it's stuffy, you're probably criticizing the genre more than the restaurant, but don't know it.  L'Etoile's is a well-executed version of a traditional (but casual) fine dining service that anyone in a large city--with money to spend--would be familiar with.  There's nothing wrong with not liking it, but recognize that what you're disliking is precisely what they're going for, and not a failure to achieve the more chummy vibe typical to upscale Madison restaurants.  Service is exceptionally attentive but not obsequious, and the staff KNOWS the food.

It's way too expensive for regular people, but if you can afford it, it's worth it.

I will add that Michael Kwas is a great sommelier and server, although there are several other equally excellent, long-time servers, including some who work the source farms.  Like I said, they know the food.

If you've never eaten here, do so.  Get dressed up, get excited about the food and communicate that to your server.  Expect to be treated well, and eat your heart out."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to Graze, looked at the fancy restaurant across the hall, and thought to yourself, \"Someday...\"? Well, someday finally came for me. My fianceé made us Valentine's reservations, and we balled out.

I hate dressing up, but I put on a button down so that I wasn't the only person wearing gym clothes at such a fancy place and walked over to the place. That still wasn't enough though; most of the men were wearing suits or blazers. It was super quiet; there were only about 6 or 7 tables, so there was not enough conversation to drown out the soft piano music. The near silence, dim lighting, and candlelit tables with white tablecloth made it feel very intimate.

The host checked us in, took our coats, and held the seat for my fianceé. We were immediately served bite-sized goat cheese and herb pastries, and they were delicious. Our server introduced himself and talked about the food and wine selection then gave us time to think of our order. If I had to pick something to complain about, I feel that he took a little too long to come back and take our order, but it was fine.

Although the a la carte menu has some delicious-sounding offerings, we ordered the 7 course tasting experience because we came here to ball.

Their 7 course tasting dinner changes a lot, so describing the food probably won't do you much good. The food started to come out at a nice pace once we ordered. They started us off with a bite-sized amuse bouche that was some kind of apple terrine and some bread and butter. After that, we had 2 appetizers, 3 main courses, 2 dessert courses, and a few tiny sweet treats after it was all said and done. All of them were creative and delicious, and the server was great at describing them and answering our questions about them.

Some of my favorites were the smoke and egg, squab, and white chocolate mouse. The smoke and egg was a glass with a quail egg, some caviar, and hickory smoke trapped in the glass with a thin layer of crispy brioche and steak tartar. It was like eating a fancy lox bagel. The squab (which is just a fancy and less unappetizing word for pigeon) was delightfully gamy and tender. It was my first time trying pigeon, and now I'm kind of obsessed. The white chocolate mouse was thick with a thin layer of crispy, buttery wafer crust served with grapefruit mousse and pomelo curd. The tart and bitter grapefruit and pomelo flavors were nicely mellowed out by the sweet, smooth, and slightly salty white chocolate mousse.

This was an awesome and unforgettable dinner, but it was also $125 a person, so I won't be doing that again any time soon. If you're a Madison foodie with money to burn, put L'Etoile on your bucket list."}
{"text":"Hmm  I think a lot of receptions have the assumption that if you  are of Hispanic origin you can NOT afford to eat an elegant place.  I was told by both of the front desk people that maybe I was in the wrong place and if I wanted to see the menu fist and I said no I want to be seated and I did not have reservations but there was not one person in the restaurant so they had to sit me there.  I told them that I knew about the tasting menu and that I was aware you much it cost.   With this said to me by the rude people it made my stay there not an enjoyable one.   I did have the tasting menu and one of the dishes was way too salty so I made the server aware of this.  The food was excellent.  At the end of my meal we had paid the check and the managers came to my table grabbing the PAID BILL telling me I am going to take this from you.  I yelled at him telling Him I paid for already and I turned around and gave Him a dirty and angry  look .  I guess the people that work there need special training on how to not over look on your ethnicity.  

I could have giving this restaurant five stars but the over look made
Me giving them a NEGATIVE  10 stars"}
{"text":"We were here for graduation weekend, so there was a prixe-fixe menu- which was absolutely amazing. We loved the food and loved the bartenders, Mike and Scott, so much that we had our dinner at the bar. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We went during restaurant week for a work dinner, it was FANTASTIC. Yes it was small plate, but I left feeling comfortable and super satisfied. The wine and food was spectacular, I can't wait to go back.

Also, the dessert was TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"\"We are an amazing restaurant\"  That is the message you get loud and clear from L'Etoile.  The only problem with that message is that it simply isn't true.  Besides, a truly amazing restaurant doesn't need to beat you over the head with how great they think they are.  The restaurant experience speaks for itself.

The dining room was nice, but had a somewhat cavernous and empty feeling to it.  It just didn't feel very warm and inviting.  I felt somewhat like I was in a fishbowl on display to the capitol square.  The view of the Capitol was nice.

The service was overbearing.  Every single dish had a long list of ingredients, and each ingredient had a story to it.  I'm definitely a foodie.  I find it impressive when a restaurant will highlight an ingredient and tell you about it's provenance.  At some point though, I would like the waitstaff to disappear so I can actually chat with my friends and not be talked at.  Seriously, waiter, go away!  Let me be. 

The food itself was beautiful on the plate, and in it's description.  Taste was average.  There was not a single bite that I had where I went that was an amazing bite!  My large steak was somewhat awkwardly stacked on top of a small amount of potatoes.  My apple salad was mediocre at best.  Dessert was good, but I have had better.  The food looked, and sounded special, but it just didn't taste that way.  

For the price I paid, I was expecting a lot more from L'Etoile.  I will not be back because the Madison restaurant scene has too many outstanding restaurants at 1/3 the price of L'Etoile.  This place simply isn't good enough to be charging the prices they are."}
{"text":"Consider this effectively reviewing by proxy. A good friend went there, and raved endlessly about it. I have done my homework, know it HAS to be good, but was unable to eat there personally when I was in town. None the less...

Think Chez Panisse of the Midwest. No - REALLY. This place is more or less a clone, complete with lower priced fare in a cafe under the main restaurant. 

L'etoile won the James Beard award for Best Restaurant in the Midwest. So suffice to say - you just KNOW it is the best quality food around. But with such good food, comes of course price, so expect to be exceeding your per diem FOR SURE. Still, if you are into this type of dining experience, it doesn't get any better than this. 

Watch for occasional price fixe dinners - they had one when I was out there, where it was an evening of Spanish food, from start to finish. I really want someone to eat here, and tell me how it is (and my buddy did), as I did not  make it there (yet). Couldn't convince any of my compadres to venture upstairs to eat. 

But for the foodies, consider this Mecca."}
{"text":"First; a few gripes.  The atmosphere is completely incongruous with the food.  I think if they would bother trying to add some ambiance, the overall experience would improve.  
Now, this is nitpicking, but when I go to a restaurant for a fine dining experience wearing a black dress, shame on you for giving me a white linen.  Which brings me to another point:  the overall dress code in the place was casual.  I don't know what has happened in this country, but fine dining shouldn't be so casual.
Anyways. The food was great, as were the cocktails (although table side pouring is funny).   What I found interesting was that the entrees, while delicious, did not compare in creativity of the amuse-bouche or dessert.  Presentation was beautiful, meat and fish were both cooked perfectly, and flavors married together very well.  Overall, a very good meal."}
{"text":"Had the 7-course tasting menu with wine pairing.  Totaled $205 per person.  Why do I mention price?  Because I don't really think it was worth it.  

Sure, the food is good and the pairing worked well.  But the ingredients and flavors were hit-or-miss.  The scallop stole the show.  The lamb was great.  Octopus was a shame. But overall the food looked pretty but lacked the intense, complex, creative flavors I expect from a meal like this.  

The service was acceptable but still felt very Madison (service in Madison is below par on average...sorry). In other words, it was a little too intrusive and 'peppy' for my taste.  A bit more professionalism and better grooming would help.  

I still have trouble with the smooth jazz that they play in a space that still doesn't feel good.  Just feels a little cold and sterile overall.  

Anyway, yeah, L'Etoile is good but the faux-pomp and sky-high prices just don't get me there."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have had some incredible meals, some flavors that I will probably never forget. A couple of times some items have been less than that and for the price all their food should be superlative every time. But I know, that's asking a lot. I just think if it's not absolutely fantastic it should cost less than it does."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited L'Etoile for a fancy and romantic dinner, and it was just that.  As I made the reservation, they asked about food allergies and any other special accommodations.  I was surprised and excited that they were able to customize a menu with a message for me.

I ordered the Tasting, which runs at about $125, but is well worth it.  I had about 7 courses, and they were not only fun to look at and learn what all the ingredients were, but they were also a joy to eat.  The meat was grilled to perfection.  The flavors and textures blended nicely together.  The only feedback I would provide is that the seafood or fish dishes were slightly over-powered by the sea-foody taste; I didn't get a chance to taste the other flavors.

My favorite dish was the smoked eggs, which included roe and quail egg along with other ingredients set atop some sort of cracker on top of a glass with smoke inside.  I was instructed to push down the cracker and all the things on it into the smoke-filled glass.  The result was unique and exquisite.

The dress code is business casual to dressy.  They have a sommelier if you want to pair your dish(es) with wine.  The music was mostly jazz music, which fit the mood perfectly, and the lights were just the right level of dim.  The service was the level that you would expect from this type of fancy dining.  

While I might not make it back to L'Etoile for some time, I would highly recommend it to anyone willing to splurge on a memorable dining experience.  All in, my wife and I spent about $270 including tips and parking."}
{"text":"7 course wonderful and fresh meal, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, beautiful, and filling.

The service is amazing.

L 'Etoile is amazing and the food is pure artistry.

Worth it!!"}
{"text":"I would say that the service in itself is definitely 5 stars and is a great place to bring someone for a very special occasion (they will make you feel special!) The food, while inventive and new, unfortunately did not impress me as much as I wanted it to (around a 3.5), which drops my overall rating down, especially considering the dent it makes in your wallet.

We ordered the tasting menu to get the full experience. Although it boasts of seven courses, do not be daunted, as with fine dining, portions are very small and manageable. The courses were Elderberry Hill Farm Beets (with foie gras), suckling pig, black bass, squab, bison, roelli red rock (beignets with cheese), and apple ice cream. The staff was very accommodating and allowed a switch out between the squab to octopus as well as apple ice cream and profiteroles. 

- The foie gras came in 3 different dollops; the seared foie gras was delicious, and the other two are alright. The beet ice cream, while inventive, personally didn't work well for me; I didn't appreciate the contrast between warm and cold. 
- Unfortunately, I was not a fan of suckling pig either. I was hoping it would be seared or grilled, and found it a little too lightly treated for my taste.
- My hands down favorite dish of the evening was the black bass. Between the crispy skin and deliciously treated fish, I was impressed by the different textures and consistencies of this dish.
- I also greatly enjoyed the squab dish; the octopus substitute was a bit overcooked and the flavor and delicacy seemed a little lost, so I would stick with the original tasting menu.
- Bison was also very well done and tasty and was my second favorite dish overall. The bison was tender and cooked perfectly without the overly strong gamey taste
- The beignets, while tasty were not mind blowing
- Dessert was alright. The ice cream was tasty but not anything mind blowing. 

Overall, I felt the staff was kind and excellent. The ambiance was nice (though there is construction outside so the view of the Capitol was slightly obstructed; this is through no fault of the restaurant) and is a place to go for a very special occasion. Unfortunately, I felt that the the dishes served were almost trying too hard to be inventive and creative, and almost wish for a simpler flavor profile of classic and well done dishes. I wanted to love this place due to the high price we paid and the high ratings, but I was a honestly a bit disappointed with the food. That being said, I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this place; however, the flavor profiles were just not for me this day."}
{"text":"Incredible meal with a great experience. We opted in for he full tasting menu and wine pairing (strongly recommended), and enjoyed every single dish. While portions are small, each bite is filled with intense flavor the likes of which I've never had before. After 7 courses it feels like a filling meal, and the wine pairing is filled with amazing wine that fits perfectly with the given dish.

I also love that the focus is about the food and the wine. It's a fancy place but I never once thought about whether I was making a mistake or doing something wrong. Much more passion than pretension."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience.  Obviously very expensive, but worth every penny.  It's an entire 3 hour dining experience."}
{"text":"This is destination-worthy eating.  The entire experience was seamless - we were lucky to get a table in front of the large capitol-facing windows; everything is spaced out enough to make it feel as if you're dining in your own private room. The wine pairing is approachable and the sommelier engaging; the food is quite delicious and the ethos of local seasonality feels authentic.  Roasted squad, skin crisped to an audible crackle is paired with delicately peppery radish flowers, fatty crudo with spicy, raw radish moons - different dishes working to show off the depth and range of a single, in-season ingredient.  

Everything is done with care and the staff is more than friendly.  A real, and necessary, gem."}
{"text":"An amazingly chic establishment. Windows reaching to heaven that gaze out at Wisconsin's beautiful state capitol at the heart of Madison.

It's amazing how such a beautiful restaurant can appear in the springtime even more beautiful. Our group delighted  in the tasting menu, consisting of seven courses and one bonus course.  (Not in the menu) it was an extremely special menu personally requested by a person in our party. Whom I should thank profusely!

Every course was simply divine presented in the the most elegant fashion, full of flavor and brightly ornate with either flowers or dotted with an essence of vibrance.  Course after course... each appealed to the senses.  You may never want your evening to end, as the service here is  some of the best I've ever experienced.  Their wine list is extensive and they are proud to serve all their guests here,  better than family.  

L'Etoile has set a star in my heart and left a glimmer in my eyes. Truly made for a destination, gazing and savoring and delighting.  L'Etoile is in a constellation of its own."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Not much. This place was amazing, hands down. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, and everything was just as delightful as we expected. Kind, excellent, attentive service. A birthday nod written on the menu.  Beautiful atmosphere. Quiet, but not too quiet with a view of the capital. What a treat! 

We each started with a cocktail, which have now ruined every subsequent cocktail we've had since we went there. That's how good they were. Both drinks were fresh, balanced, and delicious and can't be beat! 

We ordered the tasting menu, plus 2 starters and an entree, which was a good amount of food. They also brought out 2 small tastings before we started. We knew one was an amuse-bouche (we brushed up on our fancy food knowledge beforehand) and the second one was a... bonus-bouche? 

They perfectly paired and timed the plates. We ate a lot of things we'd never heard of before and seriously -- we couldn't pick a favorite! Everything sang. Perfect pairing of tastes and textures and plated beautifully. 

This is definitely a special occasion place (unless you're super fancy in which case... nicely done!), and it really felt that way. Thanks, L'Etoile, for a wonderful birthday dinner! We loved every minute."}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT IN MADISON. This place is incredible. As a college kid I can never afford to go here, but my parents took me for my birthday and wow. The portion sizes are small but every bite is incredible delicious. The food is as fresh as can be and service was perfect.

THis is what every restaurant should strive for."}
{"text":"Your average small town breakfast restaurant. Potatoes are the frozen versions that you'll find everywhere (the ones with that crispy outside though so its okay), and I'm fairly certain that due to the size, certain ingredients (ex; Hollandaise) come pre-made. That being said, it's a kitchen of older women rather than your straggly haired teenagers, and they even cut their fruit into star shapes which is a nice touch. Service was ok, nothing special, but the ladies are friendly and I can see this being somewhere I would go often enough if they were by my place."}
{"text":"You haven't completed your culinary experience in Madison until you have tried this phenomenal menu. Chef Tory is a genius who uses only the most perfect and complimentary ingredients to create the most exquisite flavors. The wait staff is very knowledgeable of the menu and will take their time to describe each tantalizing course. If this is your first time, I would recommend opting for the \"tasting menu\" which allows you to choose one item from each of their four courses for only $65. 

The new location is beautiful with a swanky metropolitan feel in the heart of our beautiful city. It's best to make a reservation. You may request seating by the windows, but every table in this new building has a tremendous view. 

One last tip: the 20 minute wait for the chocolate souffle is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Liked it!  Was offered a job as a bartender there long ago, seemed like it could have been a really fun job.  The view is quite nice , with a good view of the capital.  Also very nice cheese selection.  It used to be all organic, back in the early days of Hippie Madison (which are still alive and well, back down on Willie Street, but not so much on the Square any longer).  A good place to bump into Mayor Dave or some visiting dignitary.  A bit stiff, but it tries not to be too bad about it.  Servers wear comfortable normal clothes.  A curious and innovative wine list is another real plus.

Fancier than Sardine, but I wouldn't say distinctly better necessarily.  Go if you're into politics or big business (especially if you employ an environmental engineer in any part of your business) to see well-heeled members of your own species."}
{"text":"Known as the fanciest place in Madison and definitely for a reason. I came here for a special event and they definitely made it feel special. We got a customized menu as well as impeccable service. Everyone was extremely polite and attentive to our every need. I have nothing to complain about in that department. 

However, the most important thing for me is the food! And this is where I felt like L'etoile fell short. In my opinion, if you are paying this much money for food, it better be one of the greatest things I have ever eaten, and it definitely did not live up to my expectations. I was extremely excited to come here but I left feeling slightly disappointed with the food.

We had the tasting menu and I could tell that all of the ingredients and dishes were very freshly made with good ingredients. However, I found that various dishes just didn't pair well together. I found myself expecting salty and coming up with sweet. Things just seemed slightly off and I wasn't really a fan.

All in all, this was a memorable experience. Not for the food, but for the ambience and being at the \"fanciest\" restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"One of the best fine dining spots in the Midwest. I really admire that the use local ingredients rather than bring their menu in from outside sources. Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked abd seasoned, nothing so complex that the flavors were lost. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"booo. where are all these good reviews coming from? go here if you wana overpay for a poorley planned menu and some ridiculous waiters who arent sure what level of resturant they are representing"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've ever had. And yes, I've eaten at places like Tru in Chicago. My husband, who doesn't even like eating at fancy restaurants, called it memorable. I ordered the ribeye because of the accompaniments - spring garlic and bone marrow creme brulee with spinach, oyster and shitake mushrooms, and fried shallot slices. It was so amazing it sent a shiver straight through me. More than once. 
Our server was entirely unpretentious and engaging. It was like \"Wow, isn't it great to be here and enjoying this wonderful food? Aren't we lucky?\" Yes, we are."}
{"text":"Comme toujours, nous étions en route cers Trois-Rivières, nous avons donc décider d'arrêter dans un restaurant local ! Celui-ci est situé à Lavaltrie en plein centre-ville! Le décor est typique des restaurants de villages avec des napperons en carton et le style vieillot! Nous avons commandé une poutine, une rondelle et un pizzaghetti! Les plats étaient gigantesques ! c'est quasi impossible de tout manger! et la bouffe etait tres ordinaire nous laissant un peu sur notre appétit! La sauce à poutine goûte un mélange de kentucky plus aqueux, le spag avait beaucoup trop de sauce et ca goutait le congelé ! Disons simplement que ce n'est vraiment pas le meilleur que nous avons fait ! Les frites n'etaient pas fait sur place mais c'etait ceux congeles!!"}
{"text":"It may seem unfair to complain about a good meal, but my most recent experience at L'Etoile was just that: \"good.\"

My wife and I went to L'Etoile and each tried the tasting menu. This is not a special menu prepared by the chef for that day, but rather an opportunity to pick one item from each category on the menu. Well, I could have done that anyway...but I digress.

Arguably my favorite course was the amuse. A thick creme of blended cottage cheese with pumpkin oil and toasted pepitas was a wonderful way to start the evening, particularly with the Neriot Champagne it was paired with.

The beef carpaccio and beef tongue confit we started with were good. The tongue was rich and flavored the radish salad it came with in a lovely manner. The wine pairing with the tongue was a dry Alsatian blend--truly inspried.

Our next course--crawfish tails and snails with a tiny croissant for me and octopus salad and other delights for my wife were just so-so.

Our entrees were impeccably well prepared--NY Strip for my wife, Pheasant for me, but there was nothing to make it stand out.

Our cheese plate was, however, magnificent. We could not even finish it, loads of cheese and all delicious, but our wines came much to soon and were largely empty by the time our cheese arrived.

I will say this: the service at L'Etoile was beyond reproach. In a town where the hipper the restaurant is the less attentive or more rude the staff seems to be, that was a welcome comfort. Our menus were personalized, the wine steward was happy to chat with us, and all of our needs were met.

Ultimately, where I was left cold was maybe of my own doing. I set the bar for L'Etoile too high. My meal was \"only\" good, but my experience was great."}
{"text":"Okay, so I don't really have much to say about this place since I've only done the cafe/pastry service. But if that's just a taste of what the rest of restaurant is, then the restaurant is probably very very good.  Think buttery pastries that are always flaky and never greasy. My favorite is the smoked salmon croissant--creamy, just a bit salty, all encased in a wonderful flaky crust. Think fancy-ass Hot Pocket.

A note about the drinks. DO NOT GET LEMONADE to go. EVER. I did that today, and it cost just a little less than my croissant. I was surprised to learn that my drink was 3.25, but then I went to their website and learned they do free lemonade refills. Which is great if you're eating in, but sucks if you're taking out."}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to give the new prix fixe menu a try.  My husband and I went on a Monday, and had the seven course menu with wine pairings.  Both the food and the wine were truly sublime.  It was so much better than past meals that I've had at L'Etoile, which I always found to be good but boring and safe.  If this is what the kitchen can do with a more focused menu, then the change is definitely for the better.  

If this review were just about the food, it would be five stars all the way.  But I think it's important to also discuss the dining experience, which really fell short, hence my three star review.  First of all, the space feels like a hotel lobby.  I guess it's a reflection of L'Etoile's old menu - boring and safe.  It's perfectly nice, but it's bland and lacks character.  

Second were the other diners and the servers.  I've always known that L'Etoile is a special occasion restaurant.  At $500/meal for two, which is what our total bill was with tax and tip, the average Madison diner can't afford to eat at L'Etoile more than once or twice a year.  So I shouldn't have been surprised that the other diners there the night we were were mostly special occasion diners.  However, what did surprise me was the total lack of dining sophistication.  These diners were clearly not true foodies, and it was clear that this night out was their one big fancy meal of the year.  If that had been all, then good for them.  But the problem was that the servers seemed to dumb down the food and wine descriptions for the entire restaurant to the lowest common denominator.  It felt like amateur hour to me. I'm also not sure if L'Etoile will be able to sustain the new menu concept.  As you would expect, we were there for about two hours because it takes time to get through seven courses.  When we ordered the seven courses with pairings, our server seemed pleasantly surprised.  That struck me as odd, but over the course of our meal it became clear that we were the only table that did go for the full tasting menu.  Not only that, but two tables of diners came in, were seated, looked at the menu, and then left without ordering.  

So again, I was disappointed in L'Etoile.  I know that there are diners in Madison who can appreciate the concept because I eat with them at Forequarter and Papavero, and mingle with them at SloPig.  But for some reason, L'Etoile isn't getting them in the door.  Maybe they need to reexamine their brand.  In the meantime, if I want a Tory Miller dining experience, I'll be at Graze where the food is also great, and the dining experience is better."}
{"text":"Actually meant to go to the restaurant next door, but glad I turned left vs. right.  The service was fantastic (sat at the bar) and all the important details were attended to.  Had a glass of amazing zin.  The bartender was full of stories re the sourcing of the food (including his role in the development of the lettuce source they use).  The corn chowder was amazing. (Ah-may-zing)."}
{"text":"Is pricey but delicious. What's nice about this place is that even though it's pricey, you get everything you pay for... you're not going to see someone in board shorts and a sweatshirt, it's probably the best and nicest restaurant in Madison. We compare this one to Harvest and although we adore Harvest, it's rustic elegance doesn't make the extra dosh feel ok. However at L'Etoile... you can dress up and get treated like a king and queen. The waiters are extremely knowledgeable about every dish and the chef changes the menu every week based on the freshness of the food. The waiters go through the entire menu and explain where the food came from and how each dish was prepared. It makes eating so much more special. 
Terra got the fois gras and Chris ordered the soup. Both starters were amazing and you really find yourself savoring every bite. We ran the numbers and it does make sense to get the tasting menu. They say they give half portions but it was plenty of food and we were full by the end of the evening. 
We recommend ordering the least expensive bottle bc ANY bottle on their menu is outstanding! You won't go wrong. We will definitely go there again and the new venue makes you feel like you're in the modern quarter of any big snazzy city! Luv it!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the nicest restaurant in Madison. It is expensive but worth it. The view is great- floor to ceiling windows in the front of the restaurant provide great views of the Capitol. As one of the nicest restaurants in Madison the ambiance is formal and intimate but there is enough room in between the tables that you don't feel like you are a part of someone else's conversation. The cocktail menu is really unique and there are a lot of options (I hadn't even heard of some I the ingredients in the drinks). The menu changes regularly but I had the risotto with hazelnuts and brown butter as a second course and the scallops with sweet potato purée for my entree -both gluten free and delicious. The portions for both were perfect, larger than you would expect at a fine dining restaurant but not huge. I split the white chocolate banana bread pudding with chocolate custard with my boyfriend - it was really good and surprisingly gluten free! The staff is great. Our server was very attentive and walked me carefully through all of the gluten free menu options. Can't wait to come back in the summer and try some dishes!"}
{"text":"L'Etoile (LE) succeeds on every level, and does so brilliantly.  You will be hard pressed to find equal, let alone better, food, service, and ambiance.  Located on S. Pinckney St. right across from the beautiful state capital building, the architect took full advantage of this by using glass for almost the entire front of the building.  Diners are given the visual treat of gazing at the sites while enjoying the artwork from the kitchen.

I'll spare you the blow by blow on what we ate; everything was superb.  Sourced from local farms, the food was fresh and thoughtfully prepared.  While LE suggests French cuisine, I thought it was more new-American.

Our sever Michael was perhaps the best waiter I've ever encountered.  Knowledgeable, pleasant, and obviously a lover of good food and drink, his descriptions of the dishes, preparations, and wines were as good as the food itself.  Be sure to ask for him.

So, if you want the hat trick of great food, ambiance, and service look no further than LE."}
{"text":"A Madison food institution.  The food is good albeit overpriced.  I actually prefer Harvest downstairs from L'etiole more but either is good."}
{"text":"Last year, I visited Madison to see my then-boyfriend who is a graduate student at the university. We decided to splurge on a little frenchy-french and arrived at L'Etoile on a blustery evening. We were graciously welcomed to a perfect table next to the window, with a great view of the Capitol building. 

There was pinot noir, gravlax, fresh pea shoots, cheese...and there we were, discussing our future together. Am I going to leave Seattle and move to Madison? Are we going to get married? How does summer 2010 sound? The servers around us were wonderful and attentive, and they also allowed us privacy. The food? Tres bon! Even after living in Paris, I'm impressed.

A year later, we're engaged, planning our wedding for August 2010, and I'm moving to Madison! Merci beaucoup, L'Etoile, pour une soirée exceptionnel! I can't wait to return for a \"Bienvenue à Madison\" dinner!"}
{"text":"Dinner - two 50's - 60's y.o. couples. Very source oriented (free range, organic, killed humanely, Portlandia - but not over the top) restaurant. All food excellently prepared. Main courses ample in size, 1st & mid courses not so large (I eat alot though.) Pork belly app spectacular & would've been more so w/more pork belly. Fish fresh. Pork chop juicy & tasty. My only criticism of any food prep was the farro that accompanied the pork - just on the still decently palatable side of salty. Any more salt and I'd have said something. Alcohol on the pricey side -- maybe could've shaved a buck or 2 from each drink. Desserts & cheese plate spectacular -- again a buck or 2 overpriced but oh so good. We had the banana bread pudding & the toffee pudding (?) I think it was called and it's the best dessert there I'm sure. Next time I'll get 2 of them for myself. The accompanying ice cream was excellent -- burnt caramel & ?????. Scoops could've been a little bigger -- but like I said I eat a lot. I would definitely go back & tell my friends to go too but you can't worry about the money and mostly worth it anyway. Service was perfect. All in, drinks, wine tax & tip & walking out stuffed -- $105.00 per person."}

The staff was professional and attentive. I thought our waiter served the dishes and wine pairings perfectly, being very cognizant of appropriate timing. Very good experience, I plan to come again!"}
{"text":"PROS: True definition of fine dining
CONS: Expensive, but worth it!

L'Etoile is as stellar as its name. Every plate is art --- carefully curated, perfectly balanced, and wildly eclectic. The flavors and textures in each bite bring you to cloud nine. The service was excellent and the food, of course, amazing! Everything was created with incredible finesse and would be impossible to replicate at home. You know that feeling when you eat out and surmise that you could make the same dish at home, but better? Absolutely none of that here... It would be preposterous! The ingredients melded so harmoniously that no single flavor felt overpowering yet every flavor played its part admirably. At L'Etoile, I found nirvana."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat, the showmanship of the food is fantastic and the service is top-notch! L'Etoile is a very classy place, so be sure to dress for the occassion otherwise youbut  might feel out of place.
My wife and I tried the pheasant and the diver scallops; both were presented perfectly and the portions were nicely sized. Both dishes, amazing!!! For desert we tried the chocolate cake and the sorbet. The sorbet was by far the best, I'd recommend it to anyone for a light way to finish off the dinner. The chocolate cake, not bad, but a bit heavy after a three course meal.
For drinks I'd recommend the Meyer Lemon gimlet, it was close to the best thing I've had to drink in a very long time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous
Great service
Extensive, well curated wine list
And the food....brilliantly fresh, stupendous showcase of local Wisconsin

Rare to find an enterprise of this caliber"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner. Great ambience but the food is okay for the price$$$$. I had the grass fed ribeye and it was a bit tough. Come here only if you're ready to spend $$$$."}
{"text":"L'Etoile is probably the only restaurant that I would consider \"formal\" or \"fancy\" in Madison (though there was a group of 20-somethings in t-shirts for what looked like a work or recruiting event last time I was there).  I've probably been 7-8 times over the last decade, going back to when they were upstairs and down the street. Definitely a special-occasion type of place.  I keep wondering, given the mediocre and mixed reviews of Tory Miller's other restaurants if L'Etoile is going to start to slide (something you worry about if you're going to drop the amount of $$ this place requires).  Based on a recent visit and every previous visit I'd have to say that they're staying the course-- every dish, every bite, completely nails it.  I think it's tied with Forequarter for best in Madison, but my wife gives L'Etoile the edge."}
{"text":"Very, very expensive. Make sure you are going with other people, as it is an experience. But it is good food and a good atmosphere.

{"text":"On our little Midwest foodie tour, we decided to splurge here and it was well worth it.  The friendly staff had no problem changing our reservations a few times and we arrived to staff immediately taking our coats and sitting us at one of their very spacious tables with personalized menus.  We were slightly disappointed they stopped the tasting menu we had requested, but quickly forgot our worries once our mouths started watering over the menu.

I ordered:
Porkbelly radicchio salad
Dry-aged steak with cabernet jus and potato gratin 
Drinks: Trans euro express cocktail, Pinot noir from NE Italy, and the desert flight of wines

Everything was just a little over the top. Definitely a place you go when you want to spoil yourself or others."}
{"text":"Let the dust settle on their new space.  Excellent service as always, food was great, things were shaky.  I heard a horror story about that Graze place.  Let this one simmer a little."}
{"text":"An amazing dining experience! Our server Frank bestowed upon us not only the finest combinations of locally grown foods transformed into savory dishes, but an education in the community's farming techniques and fresh local ingredients. 

I had the ribeye Oscar (with king crab and bernaise - yum!!) paired with a sweet creamy corn chowder over grilled scallops. my husband had tempura battered squash blossoms with an array of fresh vegetables and just the right amount of spice, along with a crisp, tender pheasant served with creamy potatoes and sweet corn. All seasonal, all local and incredibly fresh!

Then desert. We had apricot dumpling with fresh quark, sweet corn ice cream and apricot chutney; and chocolate cake with red currant sorbet - delightful!

Each course was paired with a nice glass of wine, champagne or port - selected and presented by the in-house sommelier- and topped off with a shot of brandy. 

It'll set you back a few bills but for any foodie who enjoys a 3-4 hour meal, l'etoile  in Madison is a phenomenal experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were amazing. 

The difference between both visits was the lighting. I actually do like to see my food so if L'Etoile can refrain from dimming the lights, it's much appreciated! I know some folks like the romantic setting but seriously, it's all about the food and I would like to see it to appreciate it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely dinner here over this past weekend.

This is one of the best restaurants in Wisconsin, located right across from the capitol building.  The restaurant has really high ceilings and a large glass wall that shows off a view of the capitol.

We opted for the tasting menu.  This consisted of 7 courses along with a couple additional bites along the way.  Just about every course was good but there were not too many that I would but in the very good to excellent category.  Wife's favorite dish was the soft shell crab. 
 I subbed the soft shell crab for halibut.  This dish was very good, with the curry broth really making it.  For me the best dish was the cheese course.  This might have been the best cheese course I have ever had.  Otherwise a lot of the dishes were missing some pop that would have put them over the top.

That being said the price was very reasonable.  If we are in Madison we will find our way back."}
{"text":"By far, the best and most amazing dinner I have had in Madison. I took my fiancee here for our 5 year anniversary/\"she said 'yes'\" dinner and we were blown away. From the custom Manhattans we drank, to the wine pairings we had with the exquisite selections from a superb menu....this is such an amazing restaurant. Don't treat this place like a so-so night or subpar special occasion. This is for restaurant and it's offerings is for \"THAT\" occasion that requires an exclamation point at the end of \"Will you marry me?!\" or \"I got a new job with a 50% raise above the current salary!\" type of gravitas. 

If you go here and have anything less than the most amazing meal, service, experience, I don't know what to tell you except you, except maybe move to Monaco"}
{"text":"My husband got me a gift certificate for Christmas because I wanted to try a French Restaurant, though I found out it is now fine dining with French influence (so you know).  

I was completely impressed by the food, the venue and the service--someone put my coat on for me. We felt very-well take care of. There was a teensy issue with the service, but when I called to discuss it with a manager (I wanted to be thorough) an OWNER called me back and the way he handled it was as classy as the meal.

The real exquisiteness of this place is the way it has a passion for LOCAL and artisan drinks and food. I had never before tasted $25 dollar champagne, but let me tell you, it is worth every red cent.  I went all out and got the steak, and the blue cheese butter business on the top was what I want to be buried in.

L'Etoile is superb, plan on spending $, look at the drink menu to make sure you understand what you are getting, and make sure the waiter is telling you everything about your meal, because they certainly have put a lot into creating a special place in Madison.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amaaaaazing food experience! The moment I walked in, I knew I'd love the place. The ambience is great and you have a great view of the Capitol. The restaurant itself is fairly small, so make sure you make reservations on the busier weekend nights! 

You have an option of getting the $125 seven course menu with a $65 wine pairing or you can choose from their a la carte menu with appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I opted for just a simple entree, the guinea hen. I've never had...hen before, but it was fantastic! Super succulent and juicy and the sauce was flawless. I also tried the Monkfish which was super unique, but it wasn't as enjoyable as the guinea hen. 

My favorite part of the experience was the random food they bring you! Beyond the delicious bread, they bring you amuse bouche, and a couple of other small treats along the way. After the meal, a small complementary dessert plate was given (bite sized desserts) with macaroons, truffles, and some jelly stuff that was pretty darn tasty.

Yes, this place is quite pricey, but it's a terrific unique experience with outstanding service. I'd completely recommend it if you're feeling like spending more for some great food!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the commitment to locally-produced, sustainable foods.  

The atmosphere was very nice.  The staff was friendly for the most part - we did wait 10 minutes at the bar before being asked if we wanted a drink - and we were the only people sitting there. 

I had the unfortunate experience of biting into fat frequently during my four-course dinner.  pork fat - chicken fat - argh!  so gross!

My favorite part of my meal was the spinach.  

We'll probably go back to give it another chance. 

REALLY wish they had valet parking."}
{"text":"Our waiter made ONLY FOUR stops at our table during our dinner-to take our order (someone else delivered it), a 20 second stop to smile and say \"how is everything?\",to drop off the check, and to pick up the payment!  No offers for a second drink or wine-nothing!  My $56 ribeye stake was tough and the rest of the food was only so-so.  VERY disappointing after driving from MKE to spend the weekend in Madison for our special celebration.  Thankfully, the rest of Madison didn't let us down!"}
{"text":"The service and food was amazing. The highlight was the  steak with marrow and blue cheese butter. I will definitely visit again the next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"As far as fine dining is concerned, this is the best place in Madison. This chef is extremely talented, anything you order will be top notch. They also have an incredibly knowledgeable staff and an excellent wine list. 5 star, two thumbs up, gold medal winner!"}
{"text":"first of all, i'd suggest you to make a reservation to dine here.

then, i'd suggest you take note that the restaurant has a seasonal menu and extensively uses local farmers for their ingredients. that the executive chef knows his food.

then, i'd suggest you to dress up real nice because let's face it, we hardly ever do that anymore. let's do something for the hell of it.

then, i'd suggest going here for a special occasion. whether it be a birthday, marriage, graduation, childbirth, or conquering the last level of that video game.

then, i'd suggest selecting the 5-course option along with the six-wine pairing. it's definitely worth the price.

then, i'd suggest letting yourself indulge in the haute cuisine. close your eyes and savor the flavors and textures. and how they complement one another.

then, i'd suggest in letting the waiter pamper your every whim and inquiry. engage in some lively conversation with the enthusiastic, earnest sommelier about the varietals and regions of the offered wines.

but finally, embrace the moment you're in. enjoy the discourse; truly enjoy the person(s) you're with.

yes, it's just dinner. 
but if you let it -
it's a memorable experience."}
{"text":"The best fancy experience in all of Madison.  Think 25th anniversary, proposing, your true love's birthday, etc......If you make a special reservation they will make you custom menus with a greeting with your name at the top!

So, there I was, broken-hearted on my birthday and ready to make a splash as a single gal.  I said to myself \"Dammit girl, you are taking yourself to L'Etoile for YOUR birthday. Done and done.\"

My best gf and I went here to start my birthday festivities.  Having lived in Madison for 5 years prior to the event, I had always gazed wistfully up at the windows of L'Etoile (the place is above Cafe Soleil).  And now I was here!

If I remember correctly, you get little sample tastes of some cheese, etc and then order a 1st course (mine was some delish ravioli thing) and then the main course (tuna! amazing!).  Take note that they use fresh local ingredients so I assume the menu is always evolving.

Short story: You will be treated to a five star experience that will ooze into a couple of hours.  Granted, be ready to spend some money, but you will love it.

FYI: We actually had a credit card snafu that took the place about 3 weeks to fully correct.  While not appreciated, I will not dock stars.  This review is from a March 2009 experience."}
{"text":"Okay.  4 stars is really harsh for Madison's flagship gourmet restaurant.   Maybe too harsh.  The food is excellent.  The service is excellent. The setting is excellent. Everything is excellent. Except the prices.  This place is getting more expensive than the French Laundry in Napa Valley. I'd give it 5 stars I but have to subtract a star because of the price. Everything else gives it 5 stars.  It is really good. But someone has to call then out on the wildly inflated prices on the menu."}

Another fabulous dinner at L'Etoile!  This time we dined off of the à la cart menu. And luckily for us, staff remembered that the kitchen had ordered see urchin for us, which we were not able to eat, due to an airline SNAFU.  Much more to come, pics attached.

21 Dec 2016
Yet another absolutely fabulous meal at L'Etoile!!  How do they continue to absolutely amaze us so constantly?  We dined in their special \"Cellar Gems Tasting Menu,\" and were surprised to find yet another best meal ever at this fine restaurant.  We immediately discussed this meal on leaving the restaurant, and quickly concluded that we agreed, it was yet another height reached by the wonderful people who make L'Etoile what it is.

18 Jan 2017
Another absolutely fantastic meal at L'Etoile!  It just keeps getting better. We are so pleased at how we go for more meals, and the staff and kitchen continued to dazzle us with wonderful food!

14 Feb 2017 - another meal here for Valentines Day.  Photos will accompany this, but no written review this time.

Just stopped in for cocktails and appetizers, but Chef Itaru had other plans, and we ate a marvelous sequence of great food with great wine, and wonderful cocktails, and left wishing we had planned it that way from the start!
----------/
11 March 2017
L'Etoile remains, as ever, at the top of their game!  Chef Itaru Nagano heard we we were coming only sometime the afternoon we ate there and had a custom menu prepared for us!  It was, as always, excellent!  EVERYTHING was a Standout, from the Oyster with chawanmushi and caviar, the Potato Leek Soup, Monkfish, Squab (sans bones), Peterson 100-day Dry Aged Beef, to the cheese course of Hook's \"Triple Play,\" and dessert of White Chocolate Cheesecake.
------* 15 June 2017 *------
Though we've eaten SEVERAL times after March that we're not added here, today's meal was too spectacular to leave out!  Our Yellowtail Crudo was marvelous!  The tanginess of lightly pickled fresh cucumbers paired great with the cool freshness of good raw tuna.  The foie gras was simply over-the-top incredible!  For all who've never had this particular preparation, you're missing out!  Our halibut was nicely crunchy outside and tender and flaky inside.  Lamb, fiddle heads, succulent young potatoes epitomize the deliciousness of the best of spring!  And the wine pairings were among the best ever!  Aged ribeye served atop a heated ceramic disc with herbs below producing an intensely appetizing aroma!  Preparation of the Hook's cheese was awesome, such intense flavors, and again, perfectly paired with a quite unusual wine - Merlot from Washington State's Walla Walla Valley.  Sunflower cake with richly delicious strawberries splendidly paired with a selections des grains nobles Gewurztraminer wine from Alsace, France.  Yummylicious!"}
{"text":"I ate at L'Etoile several weeks back for my best friend's 30th birthday and had a really, really mixed experience.  It was so mixed that the only way I can really review it is to list the pros and cons out side by side:

+ Wait staff was really friendly, and prompt.  
+ The menu was customized for her birthday
+ The knife cuts and cooking of every protein and vegetable was pretty much perfect every time.
+ The beef dish with anchovy beurre blanc was probably one of the best things I'll ever eat in my life.
+ The foie gras square with port reduction is definitely the best foie gras I will probably ever have.
+ The caramelle pork pasta was stunning.  Flavorful, tender, and simply magical.  I could eat a bowl of it everyday and die happy.
+ The after-dinner treat of the dark chocolate strawberry rhubarb truffle and yuzu pâte de fruit was stunning.  Should've been on the main menu it was so heavenly.

- They kept on bringing us bread and asking if we wanted more, almost as if to fill us up on it - this seems a little bit degrading for a restaurant of this supposed caliber.
- Several pairings just do not work.  Do not serve scallops with sweet potato and delicata squash - it is gross.  Do not serve foie gras pate inside a gougere with cranberry relish - it is dreadful and sour, and most definitely not in a good way.
- The poached lobster in the lobster dish was rubbery and severely overcooked.  Squeaky and hard to get down.
- The pastry chef doesn't know what they're doing.  The pumpkin mousse didn't taste of pumpkin, and the cranberry apple gastrique had far too much vinegar in it.  Sadly, there was far too much of it on the plate, making the whole dish become a vinegar and sugar bomb all at the same time.  The balance was nonexistent.

In general, I guess it seems like they're really good with meats, but really terrible with fish and more importantly, balancing flavors with fish.  I probably would be back, but I would be extremely cautious about what I ordered.  They pick a lot of interesting and fun flavor combinations, but in our night out, a good half of them really fell flat."}
{"text":"Okay so full disclosure, I'm really torn on this review. I loved L'Etoile years ago when it was in an upstairs space just a block away from it's current location. You walked up a flight of narrow, rickety stairs to an intimate dining room of perhaps 20 tables and a small bar with a handful of stools. The menu was unapologetically classic French cuisine with no foams, fuss or fusion. 

Today, L'Etoile is on the forefront of Madison's contemporary food scene with accolades and new blood in the kitchen. The space is voluminous with floor to ceiling windows, a crowd of well appointed people and a handful of folks whose laughter cuts through dinner conversation thanks to the acoustics. The menu is progressive and creative, well-deserving of recognition and indicative of great technique, the staff is knowledgeable and the wine menu is one of the best in Madison (if not the best). 

These are habitually the characteristics of what I crave in fine dining but every once in a while a memory makes an indelible mark and you just want that same meal, same service and same experience to last forever."}
{"text":"Ive recommended this place so many times youd think I get paid for it!

This still is the best dining experience Ive had in Madison in 4 years. The service was amazing and friendly without being overbearing. The amuse bushe was a great fine dining touch I like to see as well. 

All servings were small but there were many and I left feeling satisfied but not stufed as most Wisconsin restaurants are want to do. Request a seat by the window and you will have one of the best date night spots you could possibly imagine. 

And always remember: you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"I've been to L'Etoile three times and they were all very good. Once I ordered the \"Sea Scallop\" appetizer for $12. When L'Etoile says sea scallop they mean ONE SCALLOP. So how good does one sea scallop have to be, to be worth two hours of minimum-wage labor? It has to be pretty good, and it was. I was skeptical until I tasted it and it was amazing.

One star fewer than perfect because I have to save up for a year before I can afford one meal there.

Special thanks to excellent waiter Frank."}

Considered by many to be the best restaurant in Madison, and by some to be the most elegant dining experience in the state, I'd be lying if I stated L'Etoile wasn't a large part of the reason why I decided to drive to Wisconsin and after a rather pleasant experience at Graze that afternoon it was just minutes past 7:00pm that I again entered the doors of 1 S. Pinckney Street, a table set for one at the restaurant's center mine for the night.  Toqued by Chef Tory Miller and similarly focused on locally sourced proteins and produce as the space next door it was once more that I found myself seated amidst floor-to-ceiling windows but with the capitol now illuminated and tables clad in white linen the mood was decidedly different, the majority of other diners clearly celebrating special events as any number of candle-lit desserts emerged from the kitchen throughout the night.  Offered in two formats, prix fixe or tasting, it was without hesitation that I opted to enjoy L'Etoile's signature experience and although service was a bit off-kilter as my captain often interrupted me to repeat descriptions of plates already well presented it was without a single flaw in execution that each plate arrived, the flavorless house-bread and ice-cubes of butter a lone exception to the rule.  Starting off with the first of two elegant mocktails as a canapé and an amuse whetted the palate it was after a bit of delay that my first course arrived but with the thinly sliced scallops finding even more sweetness in late season corn atop an anchor of mushrooms and bright tomatoes one could hardly complain, a textbook terrine of foie gras melting into a sweet, rich soup quick to follow on its heels.  With another short stoppage between plates it was onward to flaky sablefish with crispy skin atop earthy mushroom puree that the meal progressed and rounding out savories with a rosy strip of duck amidst pleasant aromatics followed by a thick cut of lamb atop early winter beans cooked to a cream-like consistency not one of the five plates would prove anything short of stellar, a thin wedge of cheese no less impressive when plated against crispy potatoes and aromatic onions tempered by house-made jam.  Admittedly coveting several of the desserts listed in the prix fixe and almost requesting a supplemental course (or three) it was mostly with a mind on the late hour and another full day to come that I showed some restraint and with two brioche beignets arriving alongside no less than four presentations of peach I perfectly satisfied, the trio of mignardises a final send-off with the fruit-filled truffle stealing the show from fresh popped corn lacquered in caramel that was also quite good."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for dropping a couple hundred and having a swanky dinner this is your place! 

You get what you pay for and with this place it rings true. Service is top in Madison, they know food, wine and high dining. I have nothing to complain about, everything was great."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, the service is excellent and the ambiance is quite romantic.  We came here on Friday to celebrate our 2 year anniversary-we had a table looking out on the capital building as the snow was falling...it was beautiful.  The other guests in the restaurant were an ecclectic mix-an odd combination of Wisconsin insurance executives types with their much younger wives, Portlandia extras and university professors trying to impressive their out of town guests and there was even one guy who looked like he walked off a farm (maybe he was bringing stuff to the kitchen)-I guess that's a nice/interesting mix?!? For such a fancy place- there is no dress code, which is absolutely AWESOME!  The website even says to wear what you're comfortable in.

The restaurant printed out special menus that congratulated us on our annivesary and we were met with little glasses of champagne when we sat down-how cool was that!!!  Our server, Frank, was great-very informative, made you feel like you weren't in the wrong place for not knowing what \"pasta ripiegato\" is exactly....and he wasn't overbearing.  I was in awe of his knowledge on literally everything on the menu.    I really enjoyed having him as our waiter!  

We ordered a first and second course to share and then ordered our own entrees.  The first course, octopus was not outstanding in any way-it was squeeky (I know, I know, it's supposed to be that way) and tasted of olive oil and lemon with some potatoes thrown in.  I also felt like the menu should say that the dish was cold-which it did not!  The pasta ripiegato (I'm glad I asked what it was) was delicious and it was like nothing I have had before.  It was creamy from the cheese and squash and tart from cherries-my favorite thing on the menu!

For our main course, I ordered the John Dorry fish and my husband ordered a grass fed steak....my husband was SO happy with his order and mine left me wanting for more....it was just plain too small and you could tell the potatoes had been sitting on the plate and were reheated when the fish was ready.  I'm sorry but for those prices that is unacceptable!  I was very underwhelmed by my dish.  

At the end of our meal, my husband got a cheese platter, which was absolutely outstanding!!!  I ordered a flourless chocolate cake that had very little taste and one bite of strawberry ice cream.  Again, it left me wanting more.

The actual (for real this time) end of our meal was some little complimentary bits and bobs from the kitchen-some excellent caramel popcorn and little candies-that was a nice touch!  

Everything about this reastaurant was a great experience for my husband but I was not pleased with my dishes-they were either flavorless or too small...or you could tell they had been prepared hours in advance.  However, this reastaurant does have something special going on and the attention to detail and non pretentious manner was appreciated.  I'm still deciding on whether or not I would  come again, but I did enjoy myself while there!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best meals I have ever had.  Bold statement, I know.    I won't go into the details of what we had, because the menu changes all the time, based on what is seasonal in Wisconsin.   The service was excellent -  I love a staff that knows their food and that answers questions truthfully.  The staff describes the menu in detail with an educational vibe, instead of being stuffy.  I hate restaurants that think they are all that, and let you know it.  L'Etoile is excellent, and still cares about their customers and their business.  The whole restaurant is based on purchasing local ingredients and letting those ingredients shine on the menu.  I also like how they tell you exactly which farm your ingredients came from - Giving props back to the farmers/producers - Love that.  I did have the blueberry mojito which was awesome.  Make sure you bring your pocketbook......but, it is definitely worth it, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant right in the downtown neighborhood of Madison.  I highly recommend it for two reasons.  The first is that there are choices.  The fixed proce menu is outstanding, and you do not have to figure out what to eat.  The chef does that for you.  I like these because there is inevitably something amongst the seven courses that does not inherently appeal to me, so I try something (at least one thing) that I can then decide if when it is prepared by a talented person I actually do like.  And this chef is talented.  The meal was outstanding in every way.  The flavors were inspired and so were the textures and the presentation.  It was practically perfect.  And I still do not much care for fois gras, no matter how great the chef is.  My spouse is very happy about that because he ate both of ours."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, absolutely top-notch.  What I love about L'Etoile is that, like several other high-end Madison restaurants, you get the quality of a high-end Chicago restaurant at about 20% less cost.  

I'll forget the exact details of what we had, but my wife and I had an early dinner here last weekend, and it consisted of the lamb carpaccio (delicious), jambalaya (wow), tilefish, and fluke.  The seafood was excellent, our server was quite pleasant and accommodating, and the view of the capitol is excellent.  Truly one of Madison's best places to eat."}
{"text":"I've eaten at roughly 20 of the late Gourmet magazine's Top 50 restaurants in the United States, and none of them exceed L'Etoile in terms of the quality of the food.  

The best time to go to L'Etoile is in late July or early August, when virtually the meal is derived from ingredients from the wonderful farmer's market right across the street. 

The new location is even better than the old one, and unlike many other relocations, the food hasn't missed a beat.  It is worth the drive to Madison to eat here, and L'Etoile is easily my favorite restaurant...anywhere.

L'Etoile also offers excellent demonstrative cooking classes on Thursday nights, but sign up early because they fill up very quickly."}
{"text":"Truly delicious food with wonderful, accommodating service. My partnered called in advance to make sure they could accommodate my dietary restrictions, and they assured us that if we made a reservation, my needs would be built in. Lo and behold they were. That's truly THE example of top-notch service. My only negative feedback is that the decor looks a bit dated at this point and could use a refresher. That being said, the sparkling view of the capitol does a lot to make up for it."}
{"text":"We went on 10/10/2015 - our 5 year wedding anniversary.  We wanted to go to the best place in Madison.  This spot is right on the square with a nice view of the activities around the capitol.  The atmosphere is very nice. My wife wouldn't let me wear jeans but we saw diners wearing jeans.  It was nicer than jeans and I'm glad we dressed up.  The staff seemed like they were all happy to be there.  The service and the attentiveness were spot on, everyone was attentive but not overly attentive - just enough to make you feel good.  My wife got the halibut which was very, very good.  If we both got the halibut, this review would be very different.  The place only gets a one star from me because of my dish and the way the error was addressed. I asked our server for a description of the $58 ribeye and she described something that sounded pretty tasty.  It was the ribeye cut with the bone removed and the outside would be served at medium and the inside portion was going to be medium rare.  I asked if both could be served at medium and she said, of course, I could have it any way I wanted it.  When I received the dish I could tell that both sections were very under cooked, but I cut into both to be sure.  They were both bloody rare.  Surely not medium and definitely not medium rare, but blood oozing rare.  I immediately flagged our server and told her about the problem and she apologized and would take care of it.  A few minutes later my dish returned and it was only slightly more cooked. It just looked darker on the outside. I couldn't eat the center section - it was still too bloody.  Now, here is my big problem with this place.  This is supposed to be fine dining and the experience is supposed to be a big part of the meal. Everyone who knows anything about meat knows that once you cut into a piece of meat, it is hard, if not impossible to fix a temperature mistake. About the only thing you can do if it is undercooked is to cook it to well done.  And if it is over cooked, then you can't do anything about it. That's that.  So a 5 star restaurant with a $58 ribeye should've tossed it and started over.  They certainly wouldn't have lost any money on the transaction and they would live up to their reputation.  To throw it back on the grill and try to fix it is what I would expect from diner and $12 dollar ribeye, not from the most expensive place in Madison. Our server offered to buy us a dessert to make up for the problem, which was nice, but I would've preferred that they put a new piece of meat on the grill at the very least.  The management also should've stopped over to our table to check in on us - pretty normal for a 5 star place, but then that is why this place is not and why we will not return.    I see that the $58 dollar ribeye has been replaced with a $52 NY Strip.  Let's hope they know how to cook that."}
{"text":"My wife and I made dinner reservations for our anniversary. We're seated right away, with personalized menus wishing us a Happy Anniversary (nice touch.) then, we had the five course dinner with wine pairings. I'm generally a \"steak and potatoes\" kind of guy, and suspicious of \"fancy\" foods. I'm absolutely serious when I say this was the most interesting and delicious meal I've ever eaten. My wife laughed at my surprise and excitement with every course. It's pricey, but we'll be back next year!"}
{"text":"Went here last week with two of my friends from Europe. The view is great and impressive. There where only three tables occupied that night. Our waiter was excellent, very attentive and professional. The food in general is excellent - you know if you go to these type of restaurants- the portions are small. So you might end up still hungry after dinner. It is all about the food experience! I had a nice bottle of Californian Chardonnay, in my opinion the wines are overpriced. Will go back on a special occasion again."}
{"text":"Delicious, even though it is CRAZY expensive! I recommend the funnel cake for dessert - amazing! The cocktails are also great, as are the non-alcoholic soda drinks."}
{"text":"L'Etoile - French for \"The Star\" is a super expensive but amazing culinary experience in downtown Madison. 

The celebrity chef who owns it has been on popular cook shows (Iron Chef) and the restaurant is regularly featured on top food / restaurant lists. You can check out their Facebook page where all their mentions are listed. 

The best way to take in the place is to go for the tasting menu and get a reservation for next to the windows. The tasting menu is a 7 course meal with lots of smaller freebies tossed in. All the ingredients are locally sourced which gives it amazing flavor. The floor to ceiling windows open up to the Madison Capital which looks brilliant when lit up. If you are vegetarian, do ask for the vegetarian 7 course tasting menu. The menu changes with the changing seasons, so you might need more than one visit to take it all in. 

Want to take it a notch higher? Get the wine pairing. They give you a wine that goes well with each dish. Want to go slightly easier on your wallet? order à la carte. 

When you visit, make sure you don't have any plans post the meal (or have paid for the sitter to stay late). They take their time between courses but make sure that the food arrives hot and well plated. Our meal easily went on for 2.5 hrs. Also, the waiters will give you excruciating detail on each of dishes and what goes into them. In a group of 5 ordering à la carte - we just wanted to start eating after a certain point. 

L'Etoile is an experience best reserved for that special event in your life. At $125+ for the tasting menu it can feel like to trip to Paris on your wallet. But if you can afford it, it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Best dining experience, ever. We were lucky enough to enjoy a five course vegetarian tasting menu, made just for us on our anniversary. The meal was a big splurge for us, but so worth it. The service was beyond excellent. Our waiter knew everything about everything on the wine list and our custom menu. She recommended an excellent wine to go perfectly with our meal. She made notes for us when we had questions. The food we had was complex, beautifully plated, and sourced from the downtown farmers' market that morning. Every dish was a work of art, and we struggled in vain to eat slowly and savor every bite. We truly appreciated the unexpected touches and tastes along the way."}
{"text":"Maybe a Madison 4? Doing stars by step for this one. It's a $$$$ place, so generally felt like it should be held to a higher standard than it seems to hold itself to.

Went on Friday night. Was busy. View of capital very nice.

Decor feels dated, kind of 10-15 years ago, which is surprising since building looks newer. Bathrooms in particular were underwhelming for a $$$$ restaurant. In no way felt like an experience, just a room. Even the sister restaurant graze seems like a more interesting space. 2 stars there.

Mixed drinks and wine were solid. Waiter was nice enough to allow my wife to try the both wines she was debating between. Enjoyed the mixed drink recommended. 4.5 stars.

The apple taste that they had at the start was wonderful. A nice amount of acid from vinegar. Set a high bar 5 stars. They also brought bread which was good, but nothing interesting/surprising, so doesn't impact review either way.

First course we got the agnolotti and the lamb belly. Agnolotti was good but not quite a wow moment, even with the caramel crisp. Lamb belly had a few nice components and was cooked very well but was in desperate need of salt. 4 stars.

Second we got the squash and the pork chop. The squash was was solid but didn't feel quite substantial enough for a second. Did not enjoy the porks texture, loved the quince sauce. The best part of the meal was the two bites of pork shoulder that came on the dish. Honestly it had been a pork shoulder dish with a bit of the chop, probably give the restaurant 4 stars. 3.5 stars.

Dessert was rough. We got two. Neither was particularly sweet, which I tend to prefer. The semifredo had too much crap on the plate relative to ice cream + semifreddo ratio, which themselves had fine flavor. I tend to think of semifreddo as between fridge and freezer temp, but this was somewhere between fridge and room temp. The Orange oatmeal crisp just didn't work. Interesting textures, but flavor was unpleasant, we barely ate. 1 stars.

Overall felt like we walked away paying $200 for a $100 meal. I know it's Madison, but even here there are better options in the price range or for slightly less (Graft right across the square comes to mind)."}
{"text":"The first time I went to L'Etoile was back in 2000 while I was attending school there.  It was a \"stumble upon\" as a friend and I were just walking around the Capital Square and decided to enter.  At that time, it was in a different building on the same street.  We walked up the stairs to the second level.  Dressed in street clothes we almost turned away, but the staff was so warm and inviting.  I preferred this location much more than it's current  all open, no privacy, and wall to wall windows... definitely lacks the warmth that it's previous location had which was more Victorian' esque.  
AND, being a vegetarian I remembered that there was still at least one soup, appetizer, and mid course and entree which catered to my diet.  I still remember the entree to this day, which was spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and tomatoes in a saffron like sauce but placed in phyllo wrappings.  In 2000, 6 stars...

My last visit was very nice but my taste buds weren't exploding.  And at a cost of $160 plus a $25 tip I would have rather gone to a few of my other favorite restaurants in Madison, like Kabul, Chautara, Himalchuli, Baraka, etc.  Thankfully my date paid, but I talked it up so much, I think he probably felt the same.  

I was also bummed out that there were less choices for vegetarians.  The entree I picked (the only option) was a cute idea... little pumpkins that were filled with seasonal ingredients, but definitely not worth $36.  The salad was good, but again, overpriced... I can get a ridiculously delicious salad somewhere else for half the price.  And since it was a semi chilly day, mid fall, I was craving a bowl of soup.  Big mistake L'Etoile... any restaurant, especially a high end one should ALWAYS have a vegetarian soup as an option.  This establishment emphasizes local organic food, and many of those types are going to draw in vegetarians.  When I asked the server if they could make a soup he said no.  The attitude was more snobby than the last time and I was even dressed much more formally.

Not going to eat here again.  Sorry \"L'Etoile\", but you are no longer \"The Star\" restaurant which you claim to be."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is good.  Excellent.  5 stars

But I have to say the atmosphere is a little underwhelming, hence the knock down a star.

I really prefer Harvest next door better. But I understand a real foodie would love this place more."}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere. Can't beat the view of the Capitol building out the huge fort windows."}
{"text":"Amazing food.
Service was excellent as well.

I suppose when you pay these sort of prices you would better expect great good followed by great service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I can't afford to go here on a regular basis but we went here for our anniversary and it was one of the best meals I've ever eaten. I highly recommend it if you're a foodie like me. The best part was the surprising combinations - like the watermelon/champagne/ basil/cayenne \"soup\" (served in a shot glass) that we had, was perhaps the best thing I've ever had in my life."}
