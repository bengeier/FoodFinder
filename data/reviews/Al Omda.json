{"text":"I recently came here with bunch of friends for shisha. They really have good deals for food, drink and a shisha all in one but downside only through mon to thurs only. The flavor are really good and pull through smoke easily. I high recommend coming with friends!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE ever!!!!!!! Don't get a seat out in the patio, you will be ignored!   First and foremost... we got seated for 15 mins with no menu, we tried to get the servers attention but no eye contact was given, acknowledgement, or menus!   When we finally saw a server, he ignored us.  When we finally got his attention and placed our orders...the server had to come back 2x to double check our orders. The shisha came first and not bad! Blue mist and grape mint are my fave. Then our green tea with mint leaves came. Those two orders came quick! But then.....It took 2 hours to get 1 chicken shawarma with NO FRIES!  The two tables beside us already left and we still didn't get the shawarma. It took the owner to come to our table and bring us the shawarma in 10 minutes. The server clearly lied about the shawarma coming out \"soon\" when we first checked up on the order. We couldn't even ask to check up on it the second time because the server just never came back. He obviously did not enter it.   They forget your orders, and the server does not know what a chamomile tea vs. Black tea is from my past experience. The server argued to convince me that the black tea he was serving me was \"chamomile tea\"... the tea bag clearly states \"black tea\" omg, for the love of GOD!    I have also noticed people putting up their hand to grab the waiters attention, and he just ignored them.   I've been here more than once and I can honestly say they have not improved!   WORST SERVICE EVER! They need proper training.   Never again."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time visiting this place, probably the last as well.. The place has a 'good' hookah, so that's the 1 star worth, and the food is 'okay' it might deserve another star, but that's it for me. Giving it another chance, I was hoping for a better overall experience, but nothing changed my mind.  In terms of service, they had many servers scheduled on that shift, however, there was no coordination among them, so few servers would stop by one after the other asking you the same question, then multiple items would show up or nothing at all.. So the whole service thing is a mess By watching other tables, they also seem to over book/reserve the same table for other groups at the same time, overlapping each other.  The overall condition of the place, it requires MAJOR cleaning, renovating and re-decorating. It looks more like a place from the 80s.. It has a great potential when it comes to the shisha flavour, but it fails on many other levels"}
