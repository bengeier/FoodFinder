{"text":"I love this Deli, fresh cut lunch meat cut daily. I eat here at least twice a week. I've been to a lot of Delis in my time and I can say this is one of the best sandwich spots in central Phoenix. The owner John is a real personable guy and cares about his customers. Make sure you try the hummus."}
{"text":"This place is legit... I never ever put yelp reviews, but this is a first. I ordered food with my wife got the chipotle chicken wrap and she got the taco salad. Price is way too reasonable a good amount of food for what you pay for. The owner is amazingly nice and accommodating. This place is not a penny pincher. Atmosphere is very peaceful and not loud. I'm visiting Phoenix. If I lived here, expect me to go here once a week."}
{"text":"Clean updated d√©cor. Wonderful service and friendly people all around. Cashew chicken sandwich on a croissant is my favorite stuffed full and homemade. The hot pastrami on sourdough was very tasty. Come and get a latte to go on your way out.  The couple that owns  this location are very attentive and friendly. You will not be disappointed make it your next lunch date!"}
{"text":"Close by, so we've tried a few times for breakfast and lunch. My verdict: pass on this one.  Very pricey for what you get. Sandwiches are small and nothing special. Breakfast bowls are flavorless and almost inedible.   If the prices were half of what they are, I would consider popping in again. But as it is, we'll stick to the myriad of other restaurants near Metro for lunch. You're paying a princely sum for convenience and location, so if you work nearby and overpaying for bad food is your thing, this is your place."}
{"text":"We are located in the same business park, and tried Let's Do Lunch last year with disappointing results. We wanted to like it given how convenient it is, but the value and execution just wasn't there.   Well, now there's new owners, the place has made a big improvement!  The ladies over here are very friendly and are creating far better sandwiches, salads and burritos than the previous owner. They are in the top of our lunch rotation now.   It's awesome to have a solid place so close offering good breakfast and lunch stuff at good prices.   Definitely stop in and grab a bite."}
{"text":"I love this place! Recently under new ownership and it got even better. I like everything I've had,  but the veggie wrap is the ultimate! The new owners have done amazing with learning their regulars along with their very specific orders! They also made some updates to the inside that have really made it more appealing to eat there. I couldn't ask for a better place to \"do lunch\" that is a quarter mile from my work!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to add a star after a year of patronage.  This has always been the case, even after the new ownership, but the owners and employees have always been super nice - the nicest.  Always smiling, always eager to help and lend a spoon etc. when the moment hits.  This being said, I have a really really really really tough time justifying spending $6-$7 for a sandwich I could have made myself if I didn't waste all my time in the evenings playing XBox or studying, and forget to make my lunch or go buy it.  Ok, whew.  I feel a lot better now."}
{"text":"Slightly expensive for just a sandwich/salad/lunch item (can rarely get out of there without spending $8-9) BUT the owners are extremely sweet and the staff is always very nice. Along with that and the convenience to my office, it's tough not to keep going back :)"}
{"text":"Got a taco salad. It was a decent portion of food however the chicken was unseasoned and not satisfying for what ended up being my one meal of the day. The workers there are nice though and provide good service. I'd give them another shot though cus I have heard the wraps are good. Maybe taco salad is just not there specialty."}
{"text":"I tried their Southwestern Chicken Panini and it was very delicious. They offer cold or warm sandwiches, salads, and much more. Very convenient location, 2 minutes away from where I work and they offer loyalty cards! I will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm typically not impressed by places that are located in business parks. Generally you go there because it's convenient but this place is different. There are several reasons to search out this little gem. It's owned and managed by a super-friendly local guy, John, who will great you with a hello as soon as you walk in. John obviously loves what he does as evidenced by the way he talks about his food and treats his customers. He takes pride in his product. You can watch the food being prepped and every little thing is fresh and done to order. Tomatoes are diced, chicken is sliced, bacon is chopped, etc., and the result is a very fresh product. The prices are very reasonable, if not cheap in comparison to alternatives. The interior is sparse but clean and they offer a few quick grab and go options such as gum, candy bars, and chips at the counter. They also offer delivery and and catering. Overall in a sea of convenience, this place really stands out as a fresh and fast alternative. Skip the drive-thru, save some money, and swing by Let's Do Lunch. You will be happy that you gave them a try and will probably become a regular like me."}
{"text":"So went there again few days ago. And was even more impress by the place . A lot of updates, espresso machine and of course nice new people. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"A $6 sandwich or salad is worth the convenience of their fast delivery!  Favorites include the Tuna Manhattan which has a generous portion of tuna with green onion on toasted sourdough with melted cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  Also deelish is the Hot Pastrami on Rye.  I like the ceasar dressing that comes with the Ceasar Chicken Salad (had to get used to shredded chicken on this one)."}
{"text":"This place was super weird. The people working were friendly and my boyfriends sandwich was huge, but my food was not great. The soup was watery and the salad was less exciting than something I'd get in a bag from Costco. It's also pricey for all it is, in my opinion. Overall, we wont be coming back here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast, easy, good fresh food and friendly staff. Love the fact I can order online and it's always ready to go when I get there."}
{"text":"awful, place is dirty, all chairs have stains all over them.  Place is not clean, soda machines only have PEPSI products and the tea is not freshly brewed tea at all, it is machine taste,  Kitchen is dirty and they do not wear gloves when preparing food. Food is awful."}
{"text":"We work right around the corner and stop in here or order it almost every day. All of the food is great! We love their wraps, egg salad sandwiches, egg burritos, and some other things which are great! Over all, all of the food is very good. Owner is a nice guy as well."}
{"text":"After taking an exhausting 4 hour test at the testing center down the block I was starving. I used Yelp and found this place. I thought it was a restaurant but as it turns out it is a convenience like counter/deli cafe inside a business park. I almost left but decided to try it. Frankly I was too tired and needed food. It is a great idea for the workers in that office park.   Pros- the staff is great, the food is okay. I got the cashew chicken salad sandwich, chips, and drink. It was a gorgeous day so I sat outside. They have many tables inside and two or three wrought iron small tables outside. It was really nice sitting outside, relaxing and staring at the fountain in the plaza. I know there will not be too many more days one can be outside this time of year. The place itself makes varied sandwiches and meals and also has a counter with some pre-wrapped food items and stores.  Cons- way too expensive! 10 bucks and change is too much for a sandwich type lunch like the one I got. While good, that is more than the price of a sit down restaurant, full service, full plate sized lunch or even dinner. My guess is they are charging for the convenience to the plaza workers."}
