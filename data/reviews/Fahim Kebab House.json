{"text":"Threw up after having Bhel puri. New to this, please have a read of my previous review."}
{"text":"Called in to order the chicken biryani (boneless). Worked out to be $10.  Be careful- this is a gigantic portion and should be able to feed 2 people for sure. The flavours and quality were really good.   I ordered take out-so I did not have the full experience but there was a LOT of seating.   Might order take out again in the future, wish they would have some lunch specials."}
{"text":"So much awesome   We ordered:   Beef ribs without fries  Beef mishkaki Chicken biryani (extra spicy) Two butter naan  Holllllyyyyy I couldn't stop. The red and white sauces they give you are phenomenal   The food comes out SIZZLING, tender and so tasty  Excellent service too   The best place for tandoori, barbecue ANYTHING  The kabab rolls are also very good. I can't speak for any curries, haven't tried them"}
{"text":"It's a good place - I've been there a few times. It's a bit slow with the service though. As a note, they don't serve halwa puri. It's listed on their menu (not on their website) and if you go there they will tell you they don't have any. If you're looking for halwa puri, look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"So this place has actually changed their name and renovated, it's now called something along the lines of \"Lahore kebab house\" food was bad and way too overpriced for portion size. I bought a chicken biryani and a karhai gosht with lamb (lamb curry). The biryani was bland and really oily and spicy, same with the lamb curry, it literally had a pool of oil, some masala and 2 pieces of lamb which were mostly bone.... I paid $23 for heartburn. Will not be returning, very disappointed especially because the place has good reviews on yelp."}
{"text":"Used to go here for the lamb biryanni 10 bucks feeds 2 people  This place is now closed"}
{"text":"Neat little spot tucked inside a dying plaza only supported by a convenience store and KFC (Popeyes is across the street so you can imagine how busy this one is) Being a fellow yelp adventurer, I lovec discovering new places and I'm happy we found Fahim Kebab house.  The menu has a pretty good selection but it's definitely not like what I experienced in other kebab places. Most places come with a standard rice, salad and bread dish but Fahim serves it in family style.   The food was a little on the oily side but overall the experience is good. Food portion is pretty big and the flavours aren't toooo funky for first timers."}
