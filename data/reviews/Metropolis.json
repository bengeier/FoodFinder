{"text":"The restaurant has a nice vibe with a lovely outside area. The service  was attentive even though at lunch they were very busy. The specials are well priced however the food was sub par. I ordered the street tacos and the chicken tinga for starters isn't chicken tinga even for a Scottsdale version. Also the chicken was so dry it was inedible...even the tortillas were over cooked."}
{"text":"We are Optima residents and have only dined during Happy Hour so far. Our appetizers were all good  and wine as well. Welcome! So good to have a restaurant back in this space..love the larger patio."}
{"text":"Wonderful unique menu we had the lettuce wraps and they were out of this world!! The waitress was excellent and very helpful with our choices. A must try!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and drinks. The dinner was very underwhelming. I got the braised pork with garlic rice bowl. The pork was very dry and bland. It was basically a subpar chipotle carnitas bowl. Also tried the Mac and cheese, it was overcooked. Got a side of fries for the table -- that was the best part of the meal. Would not recommend going here for the food. Maybe come for the drinks, they're in the stronger side."}
{"text":"Metropolis is a hidden gem! A great restaurant with a great view. The food is delicious too- I recommend the lettuce wraps and Zona Rosa burrito for breakfast! Also, they have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Nice and quiet café in an upscale apartment area, very nice to come here for a break. We sat outside with the mist on and it was very pleasant in the shade. We had burgers, fries, and sandwiches, nothing fancy but all tasting great."}
{"text":"I eat here often, so I update my reviews in accordance with changes. 
The ownership here changed not too long ago. At first I was happy with that, however it seems to be going the other way now. I love the servers here, they are wonderful and the ambiance of the restaurant is nice along with the outside seating. 
However, I find that the quality and consistency of the food is declining; as are the wait times to get the food. The last few times we have easily waited 40 minutes to get our food regardless of how full or empty the place is. 
As we live upstairs, we order food to go several times a week. Every single time, something on the order is wrong and while yes walking downstairs to get it corrected is not hard, it shouldn't be necessary 100% of the time. 
It seems that there are changes being made to the menu. The wings we had were not good - both in flavor and quality but I did like that they were baked. I used to brag about the burgers but the buns have changed and has drastically changed how I feel about them. They seem to run out of certain items often, and don't tell you until your order has been placed for roughly 25 minutes so by that point instead of changing your order, you might as well take whatever substitute it is even if you don't like it or you'll be going hungry for the night. 
We're still going to come here because of good people and decent food...but I wouldn't come here much if I didn't live here. 
I'm hoping that these inconsistencies are temporary, but until they are better this current review stands."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Optima condo complex for a few years and unfortunately have seen a few businesses within our complex come and go.  The restaurant that was in the location where Metropolis currently is was terrible and thank God they lasted less than a year.  Metropolis is a small cafe type place with a chic vibe and very friendly staff.  I usually drop by for happy hour and on taco tuesday (the pork tacos are crazy good).  Its also nice to sit outside when the weather is nice as the Optima complex is beautiful, just watch our for the occasional mosquito.  I really hope this place lasts longer than the previous one."}
{"text":"What a charming spot, hidden away from the bustle of Scottsdale.  My girlfriends treated me to a first trip here for my birthday, which happened to fall on on their Weds All-Day Happy Hour, so we tried lots of different items.  The focaccia on the waldorf chicken salad was the best I've ever eaten & we all agreed their corn casserole dish was the best side dish ever.  The outdoor patio ambiance was amazing and we loved having Ashley as our fantastic server.  Not only did she explain item menus & offer to customize anything, but was also extremely attentive, without being intrusive, during the 3 hours we stayed to game after dining. The complimentary surprise birthday warm cookie with ice cream she presented was the perfect final touch to a great afternoon.   I'm returning with my husband & sister very soon!"}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant. Great food and experiencing the outdoor dining by the fountains is an absolute must. If you're looking for a restaurant within walking distance of Old Town Scottsdale that's a little off the beaten path this is a place you should really check out."}
{"text":"The restaurant has opened under new management with a new menu, look and name.  The service is good and getting better.  Overall the menu is good but a few times I've been disappointed with the food being a little cold/under cooked.  They should consider offering more specials and even some outdoor live entertainment...that was offered under old management and was the best part of the prior ownership."}
{"text":"Great place!! Went on a Wednesday night, they have happy hour all night. The patio was an excellent atmosphere and dog friendly! They even brought out a bowl of water. Food was all delicious. Definitely will be back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"2nd time here for brunch. I like it, but operational issues each time. Too many to list, but a few examples.
Two of my guests got the Salmon Benedict, one received potatoes, one a salad with it? When we inquired, were told...we ran out of potatoes, so just gave you salad....versus, I am sorry we are out of potatoes, could we offer you something else as a substitute. Really? This food was cold, sent back to have warmed, still room temp. Try microwave instead of oven we suggested.
Service overall was very slow, long time to get everything, especially the drinks. Waited 20 minutes for a coffee refill as well.
Nice enough people and place, but frustrating to see how it is run, especially since they do such a great job with FEZ. Maybe bring over some of the experienced staff from FEZ until things get humming.
On our first visit, we were told one of the Chef's didn't come to work, so expect things to be slow. At least they set our expectations, and the food was actually better the first time."}
{"text":"Those great minds--and combined skills--who brought Switch and FEZ to the Valley put their collective pots 'n' pans together (along with a kick-ass oven. More about that later) to bring another great restaurant to our growing metropolis of 4.3 million very hungry citizens called, appropriately enough, Metropolis. 

Cozily nestled in the verdant courtyard of the glamtastic Scottsdale Optima, north of Scottsdale Fashion Square, you can march from Macy's to Metropolis in just four minutes. The jewelbox of a bistro is hip, sunny, and features fab artwork by co-owner Mark Howard's life partner, Rocco Meneguale. 

Metropolis co-owner and culinary expert Tom Jetland worked with Chef Jason Arms to create the menu and specials. The comestibles focus on globally inspired cuisine with a variety of spices from around the world. Cohesively and thoughtfully prepared, nearly everything is cooked in a spectacular Combi Oven, a unique and healthier approach to food preparation with versatility in convection baking, grilling, roasting and more. It's amazing. Note that nothing is fried at Metropolis. Even their top-notch French fries are cooked in this oven. 

Start you tastebud travels in the mystic Orient with the Met Lettuce Wraps (five for $10.95) Fill your romaine \"cups\" from the generous bowl of diced rosemary chicken, dried apple, strawberry and corn, shredded carrot, feta and almonds with a huckleberry vinaigrette. Tender, moist and luscious, there's no shortage of flavor. 

Yum, yum! Gee, it's fun! Bangin' on a different drum! The Drum Tower Dumplings ($10.95) present six oh-so-ample, perfectly steamed shumai, amply stuffed with seasoned ground pork and shrimp, accompanied with a divine, citrusy, tangy ponzu sauce. 

Navigate your palate toward the Mediterranean with one of their remarkable Pizzettes. The diminutive \"-ette\" at the end making their special flatbread pizza sound petite, tiny and delicate. Such is not the case. These lovely pies of flatbread are generously topped. Meat mavens will adore the Prosciutto ($9.95) heaped with the mouth-watering Parma ham, arugula, goat cheese, tomato and mushroom. The Huckleberry BBQ Chicken also has bacon, a hint of cilantro, cheddar cheese and onion. The zesty, sweet 'n' tangy barbeque sauce is perfectly balanced and doesn't overwhelm. Traditionalists will appreciate the Margherita. Each one is accompanied by a generous, creative and perfectly paired salad.

Ten globe-trotting entrées, like a French Ham Crêpe, Kolkata Chicken Curry, and the comforting Americana Pot Pie with your pick of fillings are among your choices. don't miss out on the Jade Honey Ginger Shrimp ($16.95) with honey and ginger seared shirmp over green garlic rice, sesame vegetables and toasted cashews with an amazing Asian Slaw. 

The Arthur Avenue Pasta and Meatballs is exactly that: a large, steaming bowl of  pasta, tomato cream sauce, parmesan, basil and housemade meatballs served with foccacia or $13.95. You'll probably walk out with leftovers. 

Need a small side? You'll have 14 to choose from to complement your dinner. You won't want to miss out on the housemade desserts, either. Made daily, hope that the magnificent, all-American Banana Chocolate Bread Pudding is available when you dine at Metropolis. 

Sated with samplings of cross-continental, worldwide cuisine, you'll be ready to waddle back to the Mall. It just might take you eight minutes this time.

{"text":"Guys metro is getting more popular and great looking people coming in !! Even we got hottest staff! Don't miss out .. Also soon will be open late hours as long you like till 2 am!! But you need to be more quiet at optima !!"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurant that count on the kind of slightly fancy semi-prepared food you find in the freezer aisle of Costco. That's okay, but dirty cutlery, flat prosecco and a really LOUD blender ensured that we'll never return."}
{"text":"I waited an hour for a soup and sandwich, during a very slow lunch hour. I will not be back. To make things worse, my $13 sandwich had gray/brown avocado as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I was not disappointed. I had the wrap and it was amazing. Would definitely reform. The waitress was very helpful. A small restaurant in a beautiful setting"}
{"text":"We live in Optima and looked forward to Metropolis opening and we have not been disappointed!  We have eaten there at least a dozen times, breakfast, lunch & dinner and have enjoyed a wide variety of the unique entrees - all of which we like and would have again.  Particularly enjoy the breakfast and pitchers of Mimosas.  Appetizers and wine on the patio in the evening is terrific.  The entrees are unusual flavors and many can have a  protein added if you want.  They also have some great desserts and the crepes are amazing.  We have found the service to be friendly & efficient with entire staff anxious to please and to learn the names of regular customers.  We also hosted a small gathering of 14 people in the larger room in the back and it was great - pre-ordered appetizers and they were plated and delivered as soon as we arrived so guests could enjoy while they ordered their drinks and determined what they were going to have for dinner. We are pleased to have them here in Optima!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago and loved the place. The cocktails were amazing and the food was even better. I had this Montana BBQ pork and it was easily one of the best things I have ever had. The venue is is great and the service was also great. I look forward to visiting many more times."}
{"text":"We have condo at the Optima where we stay for the winter.  This little restaurant is a great addition to the complex.  The food is very good, the staff is friendly and they have a nice happy hour.
I've also noticed they have brisk TOGO business from the complex.  This restaurant stands on its own and I recommend to anyone and they do have parking for those whom are not residents."}
{"text":"I think they were working out the kinks in the system when we were there.  The food didn't come out together, in fact we had to wait for several dishes.  The lo mein was actually a ramen, which wasn't what we were expecting.  Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"First time here with a party of nine. Impeccable service and great food. Try the Mac n cheese! And dumplings and street tacos. So good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Metropolis about 50+ times because my office is located in Optima Camelview Village. They offer a healthy menu and their service is fast! I highly recommend to order a green tea with a chicken wrap - I substitute the BLTAC and make it wrap with no bacon. The Met Fit Frit is also one of my favorites for breakfast on the weekends, but I order without mushrooms. They recently added two large flat screen TV's to watch sports around the bar area too. The outdoor seating is really nice - it has umbrella's, outdoor music, and it's next to a lovely water feature. It's perfect for sunset or at night too. It reminds me of a luxury hotel patio. The patio is surrounded by lush plants and greenery - it makes you feel like you're not in Arizona! When you arrive they also have designated parking (Red Signs) for patrons and there is also valet! One reason I frequent so much is because they offer FREE WI-FI, carry out, and they even serve a Nutella protein shakes that is amazing! I'm not a big drinker, but the bar and happy hour selection is great too. I highly recommend Metropolis!"}
{"text":"Well I had a great experience at Metropolis and partially because going downstairs and yet be outside, it felt so far removed from Phoenix. We came a little too early because we were hungry, and we had quite the sampling of the Happy Hour appetizers before we felt it was time to order dinner.

The seating arrangement outside is very nice, and quite seasonal I am sure.. but this being beginning of October it was beautiful and with the sound of the water made it possible for very private conversation.

The food was nice, but not as impressed as some of the other restaurants that has sprung from the same people. The curry was ok, but served with a pita bread that put the dish to shame. But the appetizers was amazing, and the drinks were very very nice. This made for a very nice night, and I will definitely come back here.. 

Our servers were very attentive, and super friendly - which is something I do look for when going out for a bite."}
{"text":"?Located inside the garden courtyard of the Optima complex, this is a pretty and quaint restaurant great for happy hour, date night, or a gathering with friends. There is free Metropolis parking near the restaurant as well as guest parking inside the garage. The outdoor patio nestled within a beautiful garden and fountains is also dog friendly.

My girlfriends and I came here for happy hour on Wednesday which lasts all day long. To name a few happy hour specials, there is the $5 Met Burger, $6 select appetizers such as the hummus, lettuce wraps, bruschetta, street tacos, and the margherita pizza. And for drinks: $4 well, house wine, and drafts. Any $8 signature cocktail is $5. 

I had the Jade honey ginger shrimp rice paired with an Asian coleslaw. It was phenomenal with large scrumptious shrimp and I ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. My coworkers were raving about how good it smelled. Yes, it was still tasty the next day! My friends also enjoyed their caesar salad, chicken salad wrap, and margherita pizza. We had a side order of macaroni, but thought that it was a little on the heavy side. Other than that, we all thought it was a great place to catch up because of the peaceful ambiance. Service was wonderful and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Eat here often. The happy hour deals a pretty good. We live close so this place is our 'ol go-to.

Pros:
Good happy hour
Food has been consistently pretty good (we come 3-4 times a month)
It is so stinking cute - inside and out. Sitting out on the patio is great.
Very nice for a quiet romantic night
Variety in the menu - wraps to pizza to salads

Cons:
Can take a while for a waitress to come to you
Tend to be short staffed
The take out option, while convenient - you are charged to take out and numerous times they have forgotten to give me utensils"}
{"text":"This restaurant is impossible to find...hidden on the lower level of the Optima Camelview condo complex, and parking is even worse. You have to enter the parking complex under the Optima and, good luck finding a spot in visitor parking. Signage is not strong here. If, or, when you find this restaurant they offer both indoor, or, outside dining. The outside is a charming and inviting setting, however, bring a flashlight to read the menu. It is extremely dark with only a small candle to read by. The menu is large, perhaps too large. The are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They seem to be trying to do too much, with few customers. They offer a full bar. The mac and cheese is bland, it seemed liked Cheese Wiz on shell macaroni. The other sandwiches were ok, nothing exciting or different. The menu prices are on the high side. This restaurant replaced another deli that folded. Their appeal is definitely to the residents of the Condos here. It would NEVER be a destination restaurant...it is too difficult to find for mediocre food. We tried this restaurant because it is a sister restaurant of one of our favorites in Phoenix, \"Fez\". We wish them luck, I hated to see restaurant fold, but, this location has a difficult obstacle to over come with it's location."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour on Wednesday (all day hh) and had the $6 burger and then got some wings even though they weren't on HH. The burger was a solid 3 out of 5, nothing too amazing but a solid burger. A small amount of fries on the side would have been a nice addition I think but it only came as a burger. The wings were really tasty and perfectly cooked. Got the hottest sauce they had and it was superb. I would go back just for the wings. They are $5 (instead of $10) on Monday's. 

This is a cool little bar and something I never knew existed. Will check it out again. Great service."}
{"text":"Went into metropolis after a friend of mine ann recommend it she works there. Honestly I was expecting more. You walk in and it smells awful and it looks like a dump inside. The patio is no better it looks like a bunch of sunrotted tables and chairs thrown together. I personally know the manager and I know the food is old and past date but I thought I'd give it a try I took one bite out of the meatballs and I knew I made a mistake my stomach started hurting immediately and I asked if they where fresh and oh course he said yes he lied. Also while I was in there I witnessed the manager they call \"ryan\" drinking while on duty and had a girl at the bar while working very unprofessional. This place seriously needs a manager thay cares about it before it gets shut down! I will be posting reviews everywhere so other people DO NOT GET SICK FROM OLD FOOD!!! Learn how to run your business metropolis your going down hill fast!"}
{"text":"Living here @ Optima, in Old Town,  is not why I eat here.  I love the welcome you get from the friendly staff, and Jake the bartender is awesome! So is the other bartender, but I'm usually not around as much on his shift.   They both know  how to make 'n shake the best cocktails I've ever had!  Also, staff is attentive & make u feel right @ home from the start!  The Owner, Ryan, is great about introducing his staff,and Rachel is the best!   Getting to know the other patrons has been fun! .  I've had quite  a variety of foods, there...Taco Tuesday, to incredible Braised Beef w/special garlic mashed. Awesome salads!  Incredible Sunday Brunch!  Great place to meet people, just by sitting outside adjacent to the fountain, or just as comfy @ the bar!"}
{"text":"Well, every six months I try this place in hopes that it will get better.  Third times the charm.  They seem to be getting a little better.  I had the meatballs and procutto pizza to go.  Both were very good!  Price was kinda steep for the portion size.  Staff was much friendlier and they had my order ready in under 15 minutes.  Will try again soon and keep my fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Fantastic!  

I went with my two daughters for Sunday brunch.  I am a huge fan of SWITCH and FEZ and I have been wanting to give this place a try.

I wanted to try this awesome looking breakfast burrito - the Zona Rosa or the Capitol Potato Bake but nooooo, neither of my daughters would split it with me!  I couldn't eat it all on my own and we were going to the mall right after so I couldn't take the leftover with me.  Long story short, I ordered the Bagel Sandwich.  So did my girls, but they got it with bacon.  
I pouted the whole time we were waiting for our food, trying to make my girls feel bad that they pushed me into a breakfast choice I really didn't want.  But then they came!
Three bagel sandwiches!  They were beautiful!  My 13 year old daughter looked at her sandwich and said, \"mom, there are bubbles on my bacon\".  I looked and laughed and said, \"yes dear, that bacon just came right out of the pan!\"  I was impressed!  The bagel was cooked to perfection!  The eggs were not dry and the breakfast choice I didn't want was one of the best food experiences I have ever had!  No kidding!  I guess you should not underestimate the power of a bagel sandwich!

OK and now rating the other stuff - The wait staff were lovely and personable.  It was 11:00 AM and the place was filled.  You could tell there were a lot of regulars and lot's of people dropped by for take out and the staff knew all of them by name.  The whole atmosphere was warm and friendly!  

A definite DO RETURN! 

Thanks for restoring hope in my restaurant adventures!"}
{"text":"I am liking this place more and more.  The food is really good, drinks are inventive and service is great.  

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Went out for a date here

- vegetarian/vegan friendly
- 5 stars for the scenery. You can sit outside and look around -- beautiful
- upscale trendy decor inside
- Friendly, attentive staff
- food is pretty and fresh, but flavor is hit and miss
- bathroom is located down the courtyard (not in restaurant)

food:
My date had an Indian-style chickpea dish with naan served over rice. It was mostly rice with a little chickpeas on top but it was all pretty bland. The naan were like crackers

I had a cup of tomato basil soup - too watery, too salty, and weirdly gritty. Definitely fresh though, so props for that. 
Asian inspired cabbage salad with mandarin and avocado dressing. It was great, some bites were bitter for whatever reason, couldn't place it. If I came back here I would order it again. Very filling.

Crowd
It's mostly older people/professionals. 30% filled on a Wednesday evening

Price
$27 total for me and my date, no drinks

Overall 
Nothing amazing, but better than some other places."}
{"text":"Very nice place to go.  The staff is very friendly.  Food is good.  Drink prices are very reasonable for the Scottsdale area.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for great cocktails, phenomenal food, and a gorgeous and professional staff."}
{"text":"We hit this spot on a recommendation from Green W Envy salon. 

The Service: Pretty good. The waiters are very nice and laid back. They are not refilling your drink every time you take a sip, but they certainly care about your dining experience. We had this super cool waitress Barri, wow let me tell you. She's one of the best waitresses you could ever ask for at a restaurant. 

Food: Great great great. Nothing here you've never had before, but every dish I've had here was better than at any other restaurant. I'm pretty sure they use quality ingredients and they seem to have a top of the line cooking staff.

Location: The BEST part. The location of this restaurant makes you never want to leave. It's on the ground floor of the optima looking up into beautiful gardens. The parking is great, valet on some nights and easy safe parking when there's no valet"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Metropolis alone is awesome. Living in the Optima,  we eat here A LOT and I will never get sick of it. I love the menu. My favorites are the lettuce wraps, hummus,  street tacos, and valley veggie wrap!

Try the breakfast on the weekends, super cheap and delicious. Nutella crepe is a fave. Also, you can dine with your doggy on the patio or reserve it for a special occasion. Love the staff too!"}
{"text":"All the pics on Yelp looked amazing, so my husband and I thought we'd check it out for brunch. Took us a hot minute to find the restaurant (it's hidden within a multi-building private residential complex). Signs from garage weren't super clear. If you miss the one you need you're likely to get lost, but we found the place eventually and just got mad at ourselves for not catching the right signs at the right moments... life goes on, no big deal... and then things turned real ugly, real fast.

We proceed to the restaurant only to get ignored by the wait staff. No one was available to greet us or guide us in the right direction. We didn't know if we needed to wait to be seated or if we should seat ourselves. A server/bartender walked passed us to help another guess, could've at least acknowledged she would be with us in a sec, but did not. After standing around for a while, we assumed it was ok to seat ourselves. We saw a server come out again to bring drinks to the table next to us, handed them their menus, and then left us hanging again. My husband finally went inside and asked if he's allowed to grab a menu. He was given one and the server said she'll bring the second one to us soon. Everything felt off so instead of toughing out this unpleasant situation, we discussed our options and decided to take our business elsewhere. As soon as we got up to leave, the server came out to take the order of the table next to us and was quick to say bye to us in an unapologetic manner.

This was by far the most confusing, unwelcoming dining experience we've ever had, and it wasn't like the place was packed. I don't know if they just happened to be short staffed today, but ignoring potential new customers is inexcusable. We would've gladly waited to try the food if we felt the least bit welcomed or had any sense that the staff would take care of us at some point. We understand that things get busy sometimes, but the restaurant was real small and not even at half capacity. Was it really that hard to say, \"hi we'll be right with you\" or \"please go ahead and seat yourself\"? That one sentence would've made all the difference if you're looking to do business with new people. Just sayin..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and reasonable prices made for great mesl. Also the outside atmosphere is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Loved it! I ate there last night. Tried the pasta and meatballs, which was amazing, and I already can't wait to go back and try some of the other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Have had 2 bad meals in a row. This time is was a shrimp with rice dish - not fresh and maybe microwaved? The time before was a salmon dish that again tasted old. Atmosphere is nice, staff was friendly and very convenient since I work in the office building next door, but do not waste your time and money - it is not good"}
{"text":"What a great find! Seems like a great date spot!

   My brother who lives in Scottsdale turned me on to this place. It is located in the middle of a beautiful upscale apartment complex in downtown Scottsdale. Due to the hidden location, it is rarely very busy. At one point during our meal we were the only people in the restaurant. Most of the other people who came and went stayed at the bar to watch sports games on the tvs. 

  We went on a Wednesday and ordered a variety of starters as our dinner since it was happy hour. We got the Met Wrap, meatballs, hummus platter and pork street tacos. The only entree we got was the chop salad.

  All of the starters were delicious. My favorite were the meatballs and street tacos. The Met wraps were full of chicken with a delicious blend of nuts and fruit. They would have been more than enough for a meal by themselves. The strawberry habenero drink was good, but spicy going down your throat.

   For the Chopt salad we substituted romaine for the arugula. When they brought it there was too much cheese for us. It felt like eating cheese rather than a salad. The chicken in the salad tastes like canned chicken and was rubbery. I would skip the Chopt salad and stick with the starters for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Metropolis 3 times now.  The first time for breakfast.  I had the crepes and they were every bit as delicious as the best crepes that I ate in France.  My second time at Metropolis was for apps.  We ordered 3 different apps and all were very tasty and the portions were very generous.  Last night there were 7 people in my party.  First of all, our server, MacAllister was outstanding!  We ordered several apps and all of them were awesome.  If you like humus, definitely try there's, it's so good! All of us loved our entrees (including 2 children who ordered off of the regular menu, although they do have a kids menu).  I had the San Telmo beef and I loved it!!!!  We ended our meal with their homemade limoncello, which was a good choice.  You can bet we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Omg, Love the good, love the atmosphere.  We came in and tried the new menu.  It's delicious!!!!  We keep coming back and never have a bad experience.  Love the drinks, the help, the food..."}
{"text":"Keep searching, this place doesnt have it. SanTan was supposed to be on tap... Not! No IPA beer to speak of. Then I asked about burrito, bar tender shook her head and said not so much :( bad experience."}
{"text":"Wow! Tacos and margaritas all for $5 Metropolis is my new go to spot for Taco Tuesday! Amazing service from the bartender and the owner was warm and welcoming. He checked on every guest in the place, nice touch. I can't wait to come back and try their whole menu! Also gorgeous patio!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot with nice ambiance. Came here for drinks later at night and had a good time. Would like to try the food next as it looked good coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Great service & specials. Great cocktails. Inventive chef. It's all good!"}
{"text":"Metropolis is amazing! The food, service and atmosphere is to die for! I would highly recommend the Mac and Cheese. The outside patio is very comfortable (even for summer) with cool misters. I will definitely be making a few more visits to Metropolis to try many more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"You know, I really want to give this place a two star rating but the people drinking coors light and coronas at the bar seemed to be having a good time so I don't want to discourage people who enjoy that to miss out.  First of all, based on location, you would think this is posh place.  It is not.  Second, if you are not a regular, you will be served last.  so far so good.  There are some weird things too: such as why is my salmon and vegetables served in a soup bowl?  The fish was a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Same with the veggies but  rice I think was a boil in the bag type with no flavor.  I drank my two beer and ate my food and left.  A couple of things really ruined the night though.  One, the staff are constantly busy with their phone, playing with the remotes, and touching their hair and other body parts but never wash their hands before touching olives or lemons etc for the drinks.  Second, was this regular who is friends with the staff and apparently dates the owner's ex-girlfriend.  I don't know if you have a stopwatch but try to imagine how long 1.5 seconds would take and that would be the time he was silent.  This man spoke loudly the whole time.  Mostly engaging the staff but sometimes just to himself, even when he was eating or chewing.  After the initial annoyance, I actually became concerned that he might be having a having an episode or break down of some sort.  The bartender suggested that I should have said something to him but I don't think it is my place to confront their friends.  Instead I paid and left.  So if you are working the grounds for the building and want a cold coors light or corona with some of the residents who don't want to order in or cook, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Metropolis has amazing happy hour $$$. Specials everyday (taco Tuesday is my faveee $5 tacos $5 margs). Some of the best dishes are the Mykonos salmon & the meatball app. It's a cute little bar in the middle of Optima that has a romantic setting to it with candles and lights hung around the patio and above the tables. Great atmosphere and people who come in, watch games, laugh and have fun! Love it order the banana buttercake a la mode for dessert ;)"}
{"text":"Super impressed with this tasty place at Optima Camelview!  It is tucked away within the condo complex, but worth scoping out.  Nice outdoor patio, amazingly friendly staff and super fresh and tasty food.  I tried the tomato soup and the caprese salad...yummy!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I work at optima, so not only is this restaurant convenient it's also DELICIOUS. Got an oriental salad with ahi tuna and BLTAC before, both amazing. Gotta go!"}

Enjoyed breakfast here on a Saturday morning.

It's so nice to be able to enjoy the beautiful spring weather sitting on a patio sipping a Bloody Mary and nibbling on eggs benedict.
Ok... I might have been sipping the BM... but I was gobbling the Eggs Benedict.
So good!  I got the EB with the pesto and prosciutto.... The pesto is a great addition to the creaminess of the eggs and hollandaise sauce.  Personally I would have suggested using pancetta instead of prosciutto but that's just me.  And for some reason they put cream cheese on their english muffins (I didn't properly read the menu) ... next time I'll ask to have that omitted.  Their hollandaise sauce isn't heavy... and they don't drench the whole dish in it so it was \"just right\" IMO.
Now... having tried their breakfast mixed greens salad (because that's was part of Mom's side)... I would totally recommend asking for a salad instead of the seasoned potatoes. The salad would be a Healthier and Lighter option.... Mixed greens for breakfast may sound strange but it's totally refreshing and lighter way to start the morning.  Plus the potatoes were a bit over cooked and nothing extraordinary. OH... and the dressing on the salad is a lovely, light lemon dijon vinaigrette.  So Yummy!
The Bloody Mary was Good... not horseradishy... not watery / thin... but everyone has their own preference.  This IMO was good... I felt like it could have used a dash of Worcestershire sauce tho.

Mom enjoyed her egg white frittata that was filled with chicken, mushroom and avocado.
The husband opted to go healthier with their oatmeal which was served with lots of fresh berries.

Service was Fabulous!  They were friendly and engaging!  And when we asked about the salad dressing... he sent the chef out who spoke with us for a few minutes and he was really nice too.

Location... near the mall... lower level in center garden courtyard of Scottsdale Camelview Optima Condos... so this is a bit of a hidden gem... since it isn't IN a shopping center and it doesn't have street front presence.

All in All.... Definitely will be back next time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Found Metropolis because I heard the Fez owners were opening a new place nearer to my home. The initial visit did not provide anything that stuck out substantially  positively or negatively.

There were a few creative dishes that sparked my interest.   I ended up with a shrimp and lentil combo (never had that combo before) which was tasty.   Wubby (ya know since I'm hubby) had a pasta and meatball dish that she liked.  The meatball was the single tastiest item.

Indoors was on the loud side.   Especially at this part of the year, I would recommend eating outdoors.

They do offer a kids menu with seven choices which I found a bit out of sorts.   Metropolis is more to bring someone to impress for a first date than a child.

Metropolis was good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"Food was great and I enjoyed the vibe. However, for the one time I was here for lunch, it took over 45 min to get our food...wasn't thrilled about that!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! I'm so excited that an actual restaurant now inhabits this space. The owners of FEZ inc. brought their culinary talents to Optima and they have added a nice bit of flavor to the complex. The restaurant runs smoothly and it's apparent that the manager takes great pride in his work and wants to please the customers. The patio is comfortable with a mix of tables and couches as well as heat lamps. The inside has tables and a bar with a complete lineup of boozy beverages. 

I've only had cocktails and one meal here so far but the meal I did have was great! I ordered the veggie curry wrap with chicken. First off, it's large and in charge and can easily feed two people. Secondly,, the curry has a nice kick to it and is delicious! My fiancé ordered the BBQ pork sandwich which I tried a bite of. It had a unique taste that was tasty! Don't expect your typical BBQ. Expect BBQ with a culinary twist. The side of fries is just that, a small side and just enough to give you a taste of fried goodness. 

I like how they offer a metropolis card which will give you a free beverage after purchase of a certain number. I can't wait for them to start delivering to the units!"}
{"text":"This place is far better than the previous restaurant, and the Eggs Benedict was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem in Scottsdale. I was excited when I found this place that it was a sister restaurant to FEZ & Switch.  We went for Happy Hour & thought this place was awesome. I was a fan that their HH ends at 6:30pm (not at 6pm, which a lot do in Town), half off Met classic cocktails & selected appetizers.  

But, we went back a few weeks ago and they change the HH menu and not all the Met cocktails were on HH anymore, which I'm now sure which are now.   I just know that the Tokyo Sidecar was not, but the Strawberry Basil Crush was when we got our bill.  We ended up having a more expensive HH then we thought and kinda put a bad taste in our mouth. We probably won't be back for HH. : ( 

They do have a good brunch deal, $20 for a bottle of Champagne and a crafe of OJ.  I like that fact that I get to make my own Mimosas, so I can determine how much Champagne and how much OJ I want. 

They do have a cute Patio in the center of Camelview Optima Condos, which makes you feel that you are no longer in Scottsdale and somewhere relaxing.  

Please Note  HH is $4 well, house wine and drafts | $5 cocktails | $6 select appetizers - I would double check with them to see what cocktail are on HH

Originally, I would of gave the 4 Stars, but after our last HH trip I gave them 3."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Had the burger and beer for lunch, both perfect. The staff is helpful and very attentive. I recommend sitting out side and enjoying the surroundings."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for brunch today because he said it was good last time he had brunch here. The food is so bad that after leaving I had to tell my husband to pull over because I had to throw up. I ordered their tomato basil cream soup and it tasted like it came out of a can, definitely no cream in there, it was so thick. We sent it back. I had the pesto and prosciutto Benedict,  it came out without the pesto. I asked them about it and they gave it to me on the side. My husband said he wouldn't touch the pesto if it was him. I didn't listen because he's more of a food snob than I am. When I put the pesto on my food it was so dark it was almost black. I only ate half my food because I was hungry. Oh, and the muffin was like the Thomas English muffin you buy at the store. My husband got the Benedict with spicy sausage, he said it was extremely bland and the eggs were overcooked.  He got a side of bacon and it was as thin as my prosciutto.  He sent that back. The bar tender was nice though. We ended up going to another brunch place to have a decent meal. This might be a nice place to have drinks but I do not recommend eating here at all."}
{"text":"The meatballs, oh the meatballs. I can't even explain how amazing they are. Mac n cheese...not so much. Had almost a wine or vinegar flavor. Burger was decent and HORRIBLE ranch dressing. The 4 star was for the meatballs and hopes that their meals are more along the same line. Will come again for a dinner or brunch."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, my favorite being the Caesar salad's (Pesto and Goat cheese or Bacon and Bleu cheese) and the Curry chicken with chick peas. Dining outside is lovely on a not too hot day. I would love to give this five stars, however the wait staff is not the best, they seem put out to do their job and not attentive to when water needs refilled, which unfortunately is not due to being too busy. I used to be a waitress, I know how it can be and will give slack when it's due. The food is what keeps me coming back though, and I just know to expect a bit of a negligent waitstaff."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. One waitress was working, she said this was usual. The kitchen was being run by the owner. It took about 40 minutes to get a sandwich and we finally canceled desert after learning the cake we ordered wasn't even made yet (only after asking what was taking so long). Food mediocre, nice waitress but unfortunately inadequate"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale.   I had the street tacos and they were amazing.  Special sauce with them had a nice kick to it and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great burrito & salads.  Small neighbor gem! This place makes food from scratch.  Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great food here. It's reasonably priced and the outdoor seating area is amazing! They seem to have good happy hour specials too."}
{"text":"Oh man oh man!  I have a new favorite place to eat in Scottsdale.  My husband and I are fans of Switch and Fez but we had never been to Metropolis before.  Since we were going to be in Scottsdale anyway we decided to check out the place.  This was in July 2013. 

The restaurant is located on the first floor of the Camelview condominium complex off Highland.  The address says Rancho Vista but there is an entrance to the parking garage off Highland.  

The restaurant area is modernly decorated  with dark wood tables contrasted with pops of color.  

The staff were very very friendly.  Our waiter gave us a run down of the menu and pointed out several of his favorites.  I ended up ordering the Mykonos Salmon & Rice and my husband got the Sonoran Burger.  

The chef happily substituted the peppers in my dish with mushrooms and carrots.  (I am not a fan of peppers.) The rice had a wonderful lemon flavor that gave the entire dish a wonderful freshness. The salmon was perfectly cooked. I really really really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to going here again."}
{"text":"This is far my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! The food is fantastic, the prices are great and they have an awesome happy hour menu! On top of it all, everyone there is super nice! I am a vegetarian and they offer plenty of choices. My favorite dishes are the Met Salad and the Santorini Wrap; both come in very generous portions. Their happy hour house wine is pretty good too. Great place!"}
{"text":"I went here back in April with a friend who lives in the building. The décor seemed nice. We sat outside, and ordered dessert after eating at the roaring fork around the corner.
 The waiter seemed to want to rush us to order our food. I got the bread pudding. The bread was way to soggy right of the bat. Almost as if it was soaking in another dish and then just put in mine. I maybe ate a third of it. The prices were a little high for such a small amount of food we got. After I pushed it off to the side the waiter pretty much brought our check without asking us if we wanted anything else. 
 It could be a very nice place if the service  and food quality was improved."}
{"text":"Ah I'm so upset I chose this place to go with my parents with the short amount of time I have with them while they're in town. We chose this place based on the fact they have a Saturday happy hour and the Yelp reviews.
Firstly, this is not convenient to get to. Based on that alone it would keep me from coming back. It's inside this huge office and condo building. Very beautiful surroundings with fountains and plants. 
Then we walk into the restaurant. It was almost empty and smelled of cleaner. A bartender told us, from across the room and behind the bar, to sit wherever we like. We chose to sit outside because of the nice weather. The tables seemed cheap and had weathers spots. Then the waitress brought the menus... Ew. The menus were a simple one page laminated sheet, except they were so bent and stained it was disgusting. I would expect similar menus at the sketchiest biker bar in the world. How on earth can they hand these to customers? Shows the owner must be very distant from the restaurant. There was no happy hour menu, it was just verbally relayed to us.
Happy hour drinks were pretty good prices, $5 for their specialty cocktails. I ordered a strawberry basil drink, and then after tasting mine, my dad ordered the same. His came out and was a totally different color - it was pink while mine was more of a light yellow. Later my dad asked the waitress about it and she said, \"oh I forgot to muddle the strawberries in hers.\" Understandable, but she should have said something when she brought his instead of confusing us.
Food was mediocre. The waffle fries were good but served with ketchup, no special sauces, so a little disappointing for it to be on the appetizer menu when it's just a side of fries. I can't say I could taste any garlic herbs on the fries. Meatballs were incredibly unremarkable. I can't comment on my parents' food as I didn't try it but they seemed to like it.
Service was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly one of the best kept secrets in the valley.  Unfortunately, the secret itself is going to put them out of business because nobody seems to know about this place.  My wife and visited this place for the first time on August 2, 2014.  It took us a little while to find because it is actually located within a condominium complex located north of Fashion Square Mall. Don't let this scare you away, the complex itself is very clean and upscale with a modern, almost Japanese charm about it.  In addition, the grounds are very tropical like with an abundance of trees, bushes, vines, and flowers growing about the place.  We found the parking situation a little difficult and to be honest we almost left because we did not know where to park, but thankfully I made my way over to the south side the complex where low and behold, there was free public parking available in the underground garage.  Now that we are experienced Metropolites, parking is easy.  We entered the restaurant to find absolutely no one in it other than a waitress.  We half wondered if they were open and thankfully they were.  We opted to sit outside since it was overcast that day.  The outside patio has a tiki look about it with it's cedar tables and chairs, tiki torches, and futon style couches to lounge on.  Umbrellas are also available for those sunny days as well as open flame heaters for those colder evenings we sometimes see in winter.  In addition, the patio sits next to a water pond with fountains.  With the sound of the water fountains combined with all the vegetation surrounding the patio, it's easy to forget that you are still in Scottsdale, Arizona.  The sights, sounds, and smells reminded me a little bit of Oak Creek Canyon in Sedona.  Anyway, we were here for brunch, but I would love to do an evening happy hour at this place.  It would be a wonderful place to have drinks with friends and family and maybe a light meal.  On this day, my wife ordered BLTAC sandwich which very easily could have fed the both of us.  She enjoyed it very much (so did I).  I ordered the Bangkok Asian Salad, which was EXCELLENT!  I can't remember the servers name (Rachel I think), but anyway she was very friendly.  Overall this place exceeded all our expectations and we will definitely be back as long as it stays open.  I think more prominent street signs in addition to parking instructions would help the cause...ENTER ON HIGHLAND and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Wow. 
Couldn't say nicer things about this place. The food was absolutely amazing. 
There was only one waitress but she made sure we were taken care of. Didn't miss a beat. Everything was fresh and full of flavor. 
Would have given 5 stars but the desert was not that great. A little to sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"I love this little place! We live in the Optima, so it's certainly convenient, but it's also good. We visit the dog friendly patio nearly every day for a beer and daily special. Great burgers, meatballs, hummus, Mac and cheese. We tried brunch once, but it wasn't interesting enough to try again. Service is always great!"}
{"text":"Such a great hidden gem inside the Optima Condos. Happy Hour all day on Wednesdays and really great food and cocktails! 

We got the Rosemary chicken lettuce wraps which are full of flavor and fresh. We also got the meatballs which were juicy and in a delicious tomato sauce. 

I got the strawberry habanero margarita & my sister got a Moscow mule. Both we fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is flavorful and fresh. I am on a plant based diet and my husband not, but this place is great for the both of us.
Don't expect something super fancy, just indulge in tasty food.
The staff is always friendly and it's almost feels like your in someone's living room :)
We will be back  :)"}
{"text":"Three stars is because the server we had accommodated me when what I had ordered could not be delivered. I ordered an Orange Blossom draft and they needed to replace the keg. They replaced the keg and couldn't get it to work so my waitress gave me a glass of wine for the same price. My friend ordered an Old Fashioned and they made it with a significant amount of crushed ice... doesn't make sense for an old fashioned. food was meg, Fries reminded me of freezer waffle fries and Mac and cheese had no taste. Only reason I would go back would be because it was so close."}
{"text":"Leone sandwich is the best sandwich I've ever had... Focaccia bread with chicken, Apple, peach marmalade and Brie. Also highly recommend the hummus. Drinks are great, and the staff is the best of the best. If you want a solid time at an intimate place, go to Metro!!"}
{"text":"I decide to go to Metropolis today for a brunch date with a fellow future mom and I have to say I enjoyed it. 

It was a little difficult to find and I had non idea where to park. It seems like it's located at the bottom level of a hotel or condo or business district. I donno. But the restaurant front faces a cute little sitting area with a little fountain. Very relaxing.

I'm currently on a pretty strict diet (due to recent oral surgery and also because I'm trying to get fit) and can't have a lot of things, but I had some options to choose from. 

I ordered the strawberry/blueberry protein shake with a scoop of whey-- so cool that they serve that. It was very good. 

I also ordered the half hummus plate and the Met Fit Frit which is an egg white fritter with veggies and chicken breast. The hummus was great, I could eat it with a spoon. I can't really judge the frit appropriately since I didn't eat it there. I got it to go and ate it hours later as my afternoon meal. It was ok. I'm sure it would have been better fresh out the kitchen. Kinda bland in taste and rather small for $9 -- about the size of a teacup dish. 

My gf ordered French toast. She said it was really good it, but she was confused as I believe the menu stated they were some kind of berry sauce French toast and it simply came with maple syrup. No berry sauce or anything. 

I would return here for another brunch, but Probably not right away. Maybe next time I will eat my Fit Frit fresh!"}
{"text":"Note: This review is for booze only.

My husband and I went to Metropolis one lovely Saturday for their happy hour. First, a restaurant gets mega points in my book for weekend happy hours, and second, their happy hour is chock full of good deals. Third, all the drinks we ordered were great. 

We sat on a couch on the patio, which was relaxing and nice. My husband enjoyed two beers and I had the salty dog and the rum habanero punch drink. Both were phenomenal. 

I will definitely return to Metropolis to try their food. Hopefully, then, I can tack that fifth star."}
{"text":"So we couldn't find a place for dinner
And after driving up and down Sdale road
We remembered that Fez had just opened up a new restaurant in the Optima condo

There is complimentary valet on the south side 
The restaurant itself is on the North side 

The restaurant itself is pretty small
Amy was a wonderful hostess/server
She kept our drinks filled and checked on us periodically

We got the Hummas for a starter, even though I had wanted to get the cheese board... Because I was having wine... 
But the Hummas was really good and it came with some veggies 


I had the house wine, because I'm always up for trying new wines and I have to say; the house wine was good 


For my main dish I chose the Jade Honey Ginger Shrimp, I was split between this and the burger... Next time burger... But this dish was actually really good! It went well with my wine... The veggies were really good and the shrimp was really good. I do wish they gave more shrimp... But it was good... 

It also came with a house salad... And the dressing was excellent...

We will for sure be back"}
{"text":"Big fan of Tom Jetland's (FEZ, Switch, etc) so when  Metropolis was announced  I was so excited!  And being that I am gluten free by disease I was readily accommodated by the entire staff.  The setting is very modern and sleek.  It's a nice intimate space with a good vibe.

I started off with a Platinum Cosmo. Little more expensive than I like to go but the quality was superb.  We started off with the Hummus appetizer, forgoing the bread with more veggies.  The hummus was a nice surprise with coriander in it.  The veggies were fresh and crisp and there was a good variety to choose from.

I had the Kolkata Chicken Curry.......and they subbed out the rice (which was seasoned with gluten) for the creamiest, most flavorful mashed potatoes I think I have ever had.  Now, normally, I would think curry over mashed potatoes a bit odd.......but this was a really good combination!  I really liked it.  The chickpea sauce with tomato was very well seasoned and full of chicken. 

I want to try brunch next time and have either the Met Fit Frit....and egg white frittata or the Capitol Potato Bake.  But if you have food allergies just be upfront and the Chef will work with you!  I really like the outdoor patio sitting as well.  Very well done!"}
{"text":"Last weekend we met some of our friends that live in Phoenix for dinner.
They suggested meeting at either FEZ or  Metropolis.
I picked Metropolis just because the location seemed cool and I wanted to check out the Optima complex.

The outside seating is pretty cool. Something different to look at!
The place was empty when we arrived and it was embarrassing that they actually made reservations since we were the only people there!

Our server was Riley and he was a cool dude.... friendly and just good at his job.
We traveled for 5 days around AZ and ate out every meal. Riley was the best server we experienced during our trip. And not just because he is hot! He was a good server as well!  =)

Happy Hour drinks were $5.00.. bargain. Appetizers were also cheaper and a good bargain!
I had the Chicken BLTAC which was large and tasty.
The rest of the group also enjoyed their food as well.

It was kinda a bummer that the place was so empty! Maybe because the location is somewhat hard to find? Our local friends go to FEZ often and said that location is always busy. Hopefully more people get turned on to Metropolis and give it a shot.

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome  people and great food. A little hard to find parking, but it's totally worth it. You won't find a better atmosphere anywhere in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I live at the Optima where this restaurant is located. Hands down the best food , for a great meal, and a excellent drink of wine. My favorite thing here is the cheesy corn casserole , it's super cheesy which I love. Every time I come here Felicia and Irene have been nothing but amazing and accommodating to my experience here at this restaurant. Highly recommend it for a beautiful relaxing view outside , with great drinks, great food , and great service."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden secret inside the Optima. The decor is classy and comfy. The staff is super nice and welcoming. The food is top. They have great happy hour specials, and could really fill the gap left by our usual place that closed.

The tacos were absolutely delicious and we had to fight over them. The hummus was great as well. Everything we had was a delight. All of the dishes here come camera ready and want to be instagram'd. The portions were perfect as well - we felt great after we left. 

If you live within walking distance, they might even deliver to you - wouldn't hurt to call."}
{"text":"If I could rate this 5 stars just for the location, I would! The location is beautiful, like a forest utopia. You can enjoy lunch on the patio next to water and a waterfall, nice pic ops! My GPS for some reason had me going another route than the rancho vista dr, which I recommend just going because as soon as you turn down this street, the sign reads \"Metropolis Cafe\" and parking will be on the right after making a left turn into the Optima View Condos. 

The pot dumplings were OK and my mac & cheese was very dry and lacking flavor. Because it had bread crumbs, I expected a nice flavor, but nah. What I was super disappointed about was the Menu and my Moscow Mule Glass. Not to be all picky, but the Menu was nasty looking and looked as if it had been around much longer than the restaurant. It doesn't go hand in hand in the presentation of this location. TIme for new menus, which shouldn't cost much as they were black and white laminated. The Moscow Mule I was given, was in a purple stainless steel glass (see pic) with the paint coming off. It looked unappealing honestly and like the menu, didn't compliment the restaurant or this beautiful setting. Anyhoo, I would like to try other menu items and if I do try the mule again, I hope my glass is actually a copper one, that'll be nice! :)"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! The specials tonight are SO GOOD! Braised beef shoulder w/mashed potatoes and sautéed veggies and creamy pesto penne with shrimp. Well done, Metropolis!! I can't wait for the creme brûlée to top the night off."}
{"text":"One of the best place to eat and relax. We went there casually without any expectations and we found it exceptionally good. Food is really good, we ordered pasta and chicken curry. Delicious."}
{"text":"For a little cafe tucked into a huge apartment complex, this place is surprisingly good! Make sure to snag a table outside - beautiful and relaxing, even though you're just feet from Scottsdale road. It's truly a retreat! Also make sure you order something, ANYTHING, that features the focaccia bread. We had sandwiches and kept eating the bread even well after we were full, it was amazing! Great new lunch spot."}
{"text":"I love the location and the view of the camelview terraces. Breakfast was delish - one of the best takes on eggs benedict I have ever tried (get it with ham). The staff are very accommodating and went out of their way to please us. Sit on the patio overlooking the pebble pond if the weather is nice enough. There is a Yelp and a Foursquare coupon for \"checking in\" here at the moment."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a while the service and the food is excellent. Very nice atmosphere inside Optima as well."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review. I feel like we've found a hidden gem, beautiful atmosphere, an interesting, healthy, varied menu, and decent prices. We had martinis, curry, Cuban sandwich, tacos, chicken salad, and hummus wrap and EVERYONE loved their food, which is rare for us. Good luck finding the place, don't really want the place to be too crowded, cause I would like to come here and find a seat on a regular basis. And they have happy hour with good prices. Even the service was pretty good, for downtown Scottsdale it was frickin' stellar."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last Saturday (2/2/2013) with my boyfriend. It wasn't incredibly busy, and we opted to sit indoors because it was too cold to eat outside. The decor is very chic and it was dimly lit-great date spot. 

We both ordered Moscow Mules..and I'm a bit of a snob about this drink (I'll admit it). It didn't come in a copper mug, as I feel it should but it was less expensive than I would normally pay at somewhere like Hanny's or Citizen Public House-So I guess that's to be expected. I truly do feel that it effects the flavor. Good drink nonetheless.

Upon taking a look at the menu, I noticed that it says that many of the entrees can be made meat free. While I appreciate the effort to cater to vegetarians, many of the entree items had meat in the name--removing it from the dish seems a bit pointless, and almost begs the question that if I ordered the Chicken Curry and asked for no meat, am I still paying the same price? My suggestion is that they should just have another menu (or more menu items) that's veg-friendly. 

We ordered the Hummus Tripoli, which was pretty good. For the main course, my boyfriend ordered the Montana BBQ Pork sandwich and I ordered the Sriracha and Chive Caesar salad. My boyfriend commented that there was no BBQ sauce on the sandwich, which was understandably confusing. The salad I received was good, not overwhelmingly exciting as I expected it to be. I had ordered it purely because I'm a Sriracha addict. And I also thought it was not worth what I paid for it.

Overall, service was okay. Our server appeared to be the only one working so service was a bit slower than expected. I am giving this restaurant 3 stars based on the fact that although my experience was so-so, I feel as though this restaurant has good potential. I'd come back once the restaurant has been open a few months."}
{"text":"A very nice place with a widely varied menu and fair prices. The Happy Hour is very good. We sat at the bar and had chicken and beef tacos. They are slightly spicy, but not too much to bother my picky wife.  We both had salads, which were a very good size. The service was very good, Jane, the bartender was very nice and efficient.  

The man sitting next to me ordered the tomato basil soup and the pepperoni pizza (called a pizzette). They both looked very good. 

Since it was our first time there, knowing where to park was a little tricky. Being part of the Optima community, there is parking underground. We entered off of Highland Ave. and found spots labeled \"guest\". We then just walked out of the garage to a nicely landscaped promenade area and found the restaurant.

We definitely will be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"This place was great! I really loved the atmosphere, food, customer service, everything!

I came here for lunch with some friends of mine. The first thing that I loved about it was their outdoor patio. You get to sit right next to a little water fountain, plus it was perfect weather. We came for lunch so we ordered the hummus, wasabi cut fries, and a Sonoran burger. Now I'm not a big fan of wasabi so to hear that they had wasabi fries I didn't really know what to expect. Plus I'm a total wuss when it comes to spicy food. But this was really good and it had a kick to it! My burger was perfect and I loved the sauce that it came with.

For drinks, I ordered the Strawberry Basil Crush and my friend ordered a Cosmo. My drink was very refreshing, I loved it! Beware of the Cosmo! It was strong as hell! You definitely get your money's worth with that drink. lol. 

Everything was just spectacular here. I can't wait to come back to try the other items and to try out their happy hour as well. =)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night local hang out for the Optima crowd Didn't eat just had a drink, was already loaded from Kona Grill. Apparently my tab had four guest on it? The tab is laid out one guest two guest three guest four guest? Why not charge the other guests their tab?  Instead of charging me? Won't be coming back here again, BTW I hate crappy beers and wouldn't drink Miller for the life of me"}
{"text":"Went with some friends to Metropolis for Bunch because I saw their facebook page and the food and reviews looked good.  

We sat outside because it was a beautiful Sunday.   After our drink orders were taken, everything went downhill after that. They were not busy and we were one of 4 tables outside and there were 3 servers on duty along with a bartender and manager.  

Our server only refilled our drinks unless I tracked her down or asked another server to go and grab her.  I did this three times. Our food took about 45 minutes to come out and not once did our server give us an update on our orders. I had to go into the restaurant and ask her what the status of our orders were and again ask her to refill our drinks.

By the time our food came out, we were just wanting to eat, pay and leave.   Two of my friends ordered the Bagels with Salmon.  Both came out with no cream cheese. My other friend ordered eggs over easy and bacon and the eggs were over cooked.  The server did not ask us how our food was nor did we see her again until it came time for the check.

When it came time for the check, I was charged for a Bloody Mary. I did not order a Bloody Mary.  I will never go back to that place again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a weekend and pleasantly quiet.  Had a salad and lettuce wrap, which were great.  The service was good.  Decor and patio were very nice. 

Kids meals were not so good; the 5yo was not pleased with spicy french fries and sub-par chicken fingers.  Replaced with a 'cheese pizza' that had a mix of cheeses and was a soggy as pizza goes.   So, would definitely come back w/o small kids another time."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try her for awhile! Happy Hour is amazing, I had a Strawberry Basil drink that was super yummy! I really enjoyed my food.  I wouldn't recommend siting outside unless you're okay with random dogs coming up to you because they are allowed to be on the patio and not everyone uses a leash."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. Do yourself a favor and sit out on the absolutely amazingly beautiful patio and get your grub on. You won't even realize you've got a food baby going on because you'll be too busy staring at the beautiful scenery all around you. It's located on the bottom level of Optima and you can't go wrong. Hummus, spaghetti and dumplings are a few of my faves. Staff is super chill and nice and even the owner is pretty cool himself. They've always got great deals going on- check their facebook page to see what the daily deal is. Go eat and grab a drink here. You're welcome in advance."}
{"text":"After searching on Yelp, we decided to try out this beautiful little gem.  Ratings and comments were positive, so, why not?!  The food was lovely, the ambiance was cozy, but the service ruined the experience for us. 
We were a party of three, with two guests arriving 15 minutes before myself.  We were outside so once I spotted them I joined them at our table.  They already had their drinks but it took the waitress 15 minutes to take my drink order, then she asked what we would like to order, but we were only given one menu that looked like it had a rough night, for the three of us to look through.  Okay, an oversight from our server.  Not a big deal.  We received our food and enjoyed everything, but as we were eating and drinking the glasses and plates started to pile up. She would bring more drinks and more plates without removing the dirties.  So much so, the flies decided to join us for lunch, and of course the server was nowhere to be found.  Service is a huge part in the decision making process of wanting to return to a restaurant, and our server failed, miserably. Sorry to the owners, but we won't be back.  You might want to do a little extra training of your wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem within the Optima apartments in Scottsdale. Went here for a girls night and the waitress was wonderful.  I believe her name is Rachel. We sat on the patio. It is absolutely gorgeous out there.

Rachel was so attentive with us. There was a good amount of happy hour specials. All drinks that were originally $7 or $8 were $5. I got the Salty Dog- recommend if you don't like a super sweet drink. 

3 of us got the pork bowl (i forgot what it is called exactly) but it was great. I added the spicy mayo sauce to it and it made it even better. the other person in the group got the bot with avocado and grilled chicken...I took a bite of it and then several more bites. I would probably order that next time. SO GOOD. 

Rachel was so accommodating splitting up the check and then making changes because we forgot to tell her about our yelp check in offer.

We will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"We have ended up at Metropolis a few times while staying with my boyfriend's dad in the condo complex that surrounds it. I think we've done a brunch and a dinner here, and I must say the food is rock solid. 

For brunch, we noshed on a giant breakfast burrito and the eggs benedict. The portions are hearty, but the food is of a higher quality - food you'd expect to be portioned in small sizes on an over sized place at a much fancier restaurant. 

The decor inside is modern and sleek, but we sat outside both times on the patio. If the weather's nice, it's got great views of the lush greenery and pools of the complex.

Our servers were both fantastic. I think it helps that the BF's dad is a regular, but everyone seemed helpful all around. I've gotten coffee at the counter a few times too, and they're just a high class operation; they gave me a pourover for a simple cup of joe. 

The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the price factor. Might be the swanky location, or well known owners, but if I were dining solo, this might be a bit out of my range, especially for a cocktail. If you can swing it, try it - we loved both brunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food with a great ambience and environment. Very happy with the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were looking for a place with good food and a good vibe.  The cab let us out and not 2min later we were running back to catch it.  There's a good chance we should have given it more of a try...

There were people that appeared to be in their late 60's flooding out of the restaurant. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that but a couple hot ladies looking to have some fun....not so much.  It looked pretty cute on the inside maybe it was someone's birthday or a celebration...

There's a possibility I'll go back one day, I may wait a few decades.  Unless someone convinces me otherwise. :)"}
{"text":"I live at the complex where metro is located. It's a great convenient spot that locals flock to on a daily basis. Brunch is great on the weekends, coffee is always a good fresh roast. It's certainly a lively, young, eclectic, atmosphere. Great place to interact with the commuting and get some quality food. Biggest Suprise is the great wine selection. From affordable to fancy Metropolis had it all."}
