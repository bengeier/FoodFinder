{"text":"Horrible service! Ugly decor! Horrible processed food not sure why anyone would give it a good rating."}
{"text":"Just picked up a pepperoni pizza and spaghetti with meat sauce. Both dishes were terrible. This was the first and last time I order from here, very disappointed and a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant! I had the chicken souvlaki sandwich and it was awesome. Their homemade pita is DELICIOUS. My family and I shared a large greek salad which was also really good. I liked that the salad wasn't overly dressed or too salty from a ridiculous amount of feta cheese. Prices are reasonable and while the decor isn't anything fancy, the place has a comfortable family feel. I can't believe this place has been within walking distance from my house for so long and I had no idea! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Greek salad in the city and their souvlaki is to die for!"}
{"text":"I would rate the food five stars. The greek salad is the best in the city!  However the service and attitude from the wait staff is not very accommodating so they would get a three.  They tend to nickel and dime you for small items like pita bread"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both agree this place was fantastic! Right away we were greeted by an older greek woman who was super friendly. She recommended the greek salad to share and the souvlaki with homemade pita. I ordered the gyros and my boyfriend ordered the lamb. We can both say they were delicious as we devoured them very fast. The greek salad was equally as good and we managed to finish that as well. It was crunchy, creamy and had the perfect amount of feta cheese. Mmm. The pita was probably the best ive ever tasted, and it was homemade! The aura of the restaurant was comforting and relaxing, i definitely recommend visiting if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, but not sure about the rest. While I was waiting for my pizza to be ready, I watched a cook open a freezer take out frozen escargot and plop it onto a metal dish, put some kinda sauce on it and threw it in the oven.  Also noticed, frozen burger patties and a bag of frozen calamari while the freezer door was open.

First time, we ordered the Carribean Pizza - which is priced as a premium pizza.  I asked the server (who wasn't very friendly) whats on the pizza.  \"I believe its crab meat and pineapples\".  When it came, it was definitely imitation crab meat and pineapple.  The crust and sauce of the pizza was good, thats why we went back for more.

Watch out for the short blonde stocky girl! Rude gal!"}
{"text":"The chicken souvlaki on a pita is amazing here. The pita they use has cheese baked into it so it really adds a great flavour to the pita. The pita is also longer than most places and they put enough of meat and toppings in the pita so you feel full afterwards! I usually get take-out and the dine in service used to be pretty bad but recently I think they've gotten better with the service. Its a very small intimate restaurant so its usually good for a couple or for a fairly small group to go together! 
Also, the only downfall is there isn't any available parking, but centre point mall is across the street so it's a 2 minute walk at most."}
{"text":"Laterna is a nice local greek restaurant. The waitress was friendly and the service prompt! The atmosphere wasn't the nicest I've ever seen, but it's definitely not sketchy or anything -- it's a simple, nice local restaurant. They have a large selection of drinks and cocktails if you like that. The bill came to a bit less than $15 a person, which is about average if not cheap for this type of sit-down place. The food was really good, and they had a large selection of pitas, which I really enjoyed! Definitely recommendable if you're in the area and are looking for greek food!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick and light late lunch so I came into this Greek restaurant.

The atmosphere was bland and the only handful of people inside were in their 60s. 

The service is friendly, but very slow.

The food was very lacklustre, overall bland and just not very good. On top of this, the large salad is $10 for a big bowl of lettuce with a few olives and tomatoes tossed in. Ingredients didn't taste very fresh and everything had very little flavor. Along with a single skewer of mediocre lamb and a glass of wine, I was left with a bleak outlook on this restaurant and a $30 bill after tips.

This is certainly the first and last time I visit Laterna."}
{"text":"Good food and good people! Nice spot for tasty Greek food.. Pan fried mushrooms were great and salads are really good too! Definitely recommend for a casual meal.. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"good food but the price of my souvlaki was a little on the high side. i asked how much to take some of the bread home and they gave me some ridiculous price over $100.

all in all, the food is on the good side, the wait and price is not."}
{"text":"I was so excited about finally getting to check this place out. Every single time I have driven by it seemed packed or with lines out the door. 

Our order - Greek salad to share, chicken souvlaki with home made pita, 4 topping medium pizza, and Greek wine. (seems like those are the consistent recommendations by the staff)...For a Greek restaurant, I was surprised to see that every table while I was there (about 6 others) all ordered pizza, we figured it had to be really good for every table to have it, so we ordered it as well.

To be completely honest, everything was so mediocre. The salad was good, but nothing to write home about. We were kind of puzzled why everyone was ordering pizza, as we found it to be extremely lacking in flavour (crust+sauce). The homemade pita was probably the best part of our meal, the wine was great too. 

I do think I will return to this restaurant, to give something else off the menu a chance. The location is close to me and I did like the atmosphere of the place - except I had to park across the street in the malls parking lot."}
{"text":"Casual Greek Diner with horrible parking situation. Absolutely love their food tho...this place offers variety of salads, souvlaki, pasta and others delicious dishes. Prices are good and service is fast and friendly. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"First time at Laterna. Would not recommend. I had the chicken souvlaki. It came cold and was way too oniony (I'm usually one who can tolerate a lot of onions). I could barely eat half of the meal because of this. I came on a recommendation from a friend, but will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has some tasty food, and depending on what you order, great value. There serve a wide range of food. 

The salads are packed with great toppings and are totally worth getting.

The pizza is so so. The pitas are home made and the souvlaki is also worth getting.

They serve crispy fries and onion rings. 

Some dishes cost a little more, but others are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Italian / Greek restaurant right on the Toronto border.  It's family run and always packed.  Friendly service.

The menu hasn't changed much over the years, but no real need to.  I know it sounds suspect having both Italian and Greek, but hey if it tastes great, who cares.  I love the spaghetti deluxe, not sure what that secret ingredient is, maybe nutmeg?  Either way it's not to be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right by where I live so I've been here about 2 or 3 times. The first 2 times were great - food was delicious, decent portions, and good staff. But the last time I went was absolutely terrible. We ordered a souvlaki and burger and it took over an hour and a half! Food was coming out very slowly for everybody, but even people who came after us got their food first. Customers near us were telling us to just leave at this point but the waitresses said the food was coming and they were very busy in the kitchen. Finally got our food and still paid tip to the wait staff because it wasn't their fault, but I would never go back after that experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was a kid. Friendly family place that is cozy and warm. Service has always been great. Gyros, souvlaki pita, greek salad, calamari and pizza are all amazing! The food here is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for their Greek Salad and Chicken Souvlaki Pita! This place is a hidden gem, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love their Chicken suvlaki wrap. The chicken is very tender and juicy as with the most of the Greek places but the differentiating factor is with the pita which they make it fresh at store when u order a wrap. This is my go to place if I am in North York."}
{"text":"Greek Salad is unreal.  The pizza ... thin crust with tons of toppings is probably some of the best in Toronto.    The most surprising is the amazing gyros or souvlaki on a fresh baked home made pita.   
We come here every week and food is always consistent.

The best service is Marsha!!!   She is sweet and fast and takes good care of you.   I do not care for the blond lady that works there..   also, many of the staff members seem to have an attitude problem."}
{"text":"We have been visiting this establishment on numerous occasions, and have even recommended to many people. But tonight this was a mistake, and we would not recommend it based on the horrible customer service we received. Picked up an order only to find out at home items were missing, called liars on the phone, after being out on hold for half an hour, and then refusing to give us our items that we paid for. First time w have experienced such poor service."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place late one evening while they were still open. It is as throw back to the old days, and one almost expects a steam table. But that is where the mystique stops.

It is a family owned little restaurant that must have started up with simple greek fare. But they have forgotten how to make the stuff. Everything is extremely average, and for souvlaki there are many more places that far outpace this joint. And their prices are a bit high when you consider quality and cost of what they served, and for this type of restaurant the portions are not huge. 

As to the pitas I found them dry and not so tasty. If as someone else said they make them, they are wasting their time. I would much rather go to the Mr. Greek on East Beaver Creek for this type of fare at the same prices with very good food. 

This restaurant's time has passed, as much as I like nostalgia."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing service today. A table seated 10 min. after us was served first. Poor water service. Ignored us at the table so we got up to get the check... and she left us to clean our table?!?!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad but for the last three times we visited for launch, they were having some sort of \" family meeting \" and we were not basically welcomed over there. 
I don't recommend the restaurant since they don't appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"My absolute FAVOURITE Greek salad in Toronto...if you like Greek salads (not authentic--i.e. with lettuce) then it's a must order. Also, the chicken souvlaki pitas are amazing. I hear the pizzas are excellent too, but when I'm at Laterna I'm a Greek salad/chicken pita girl, hands down. Seriously yummopolous (new Greek word)."}
{"text":"Made reservations and was disappointed when our table was not ready.  We were asked to wait 1/2 hour for a table.  Uncaring management and surly waitress.  Just like the Seinfeld episode, they knew how to take the reservation. Just didn't know how to keep the reservation.  We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Laterna is a favorite spot of mine and the BF, when we are craving a simple souvlaki pita and a salad. Their prices are a bit moderate but split between two people, you usually come out about $15 a person..

This place has been at the corner of  Athabasca and Yonge St., ever since i was a little one and it is still a family run place more or less.

Their pita bread is good, nice and chewy, and it makes me wonder if they use the same base for their pizza, since I see a lot of neighborhood people ordering their pizza, we keep meaning too - but we keep going back  to their souvlaki pitas.

Their Greek salad is good from what I have had, since we have to skip the olives (due allergies) and their Caesar is good too, using more like a vinaigrette rather than a creamy base. 

Even at it's busiest, the noise level never really reaches above a murmer, so it's also a great place for a no fuss, quiet meal.

A few things I feel like I should mention, there is absolutely no parking at this place; I normally park at the mall across the street and walk over, or try and find parking along the residential area. Laterna is, also, not open on Sundays at all."}
{"text":"They are the most rude horrible wait staff in the city.  I've been going on and off for the past twenty years....will never go again.   

Place is filthy, staff rude and cockroaches running on the walls.   BEWARE!!! Never again!!! They should be reported to the health department and shut down!!"}
{"text":"Ate there once on a friends recommendation. The place was pretty expensive and just not very good.  Generic food court food."}
{"text":"All about that salad, bout that salad, no joking!



Try the Greek salad.  Best in the city by a landslide.  You can split the small for two.  

Souvlaki is awesome too.  


Parking is terrible.   Get creative. 


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The overall quality of restaurants on the over-populated Finch-Yonge area is not all that impressive, but Laterna somehow stands out.
This is a somewhat small, family owned Greek-Italian restaurant that has been a most popular neighborhood lunch spot for the longest time (I remember going here when I was 12!). The Gyros and Suvlaki are the best I have had in Toronto (and I have had a lot of Suvlaki in Toronto!). They bake their own Pita and it is amazing!!!
The Pizza is also not to be missed.
I am not so sure about the other dishes, as I have only tried the lasagna and it is average.
Sit down with some Greek salad and sandwich and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Laterna is a great place to eat when you are getting your car serviced at Sisley. Their souvlaki is really something else. It would be a crime to go to Laterna and not get the souvlaki. The only acceptable exception is if you're on a date. Souvlaki is the worst form of food to have on a date (Plato said that, I think). It gives you horrendous garlic breath and I always leave a massive tzatziki puddle."}
{"text":"Read lots of positive reviews on Yelp & Urbanspoon, so decided to try it out. Found the prices to be quite high for the relatively small portions. $18 for a souvlaki plate, that was more on par with what you'd get from food court Greek restaurants. Our chicken souvlaki was tough, dry, and burnt black in some spots. 

There is also little to no parking lot. You need to park at adjacent properties or Centrepoint Mall across the street."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! The greek salad is to die for, and their food is always super fresh!"}
