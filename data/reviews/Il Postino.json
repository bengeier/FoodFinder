{"text":"I booked a private room for my birthday dinner and we had a fantastic experience. The staff were attentive and so patient with my active toddler running around. We had good portion sizes and didn't wait long. It is a bit pricey, so definitely best for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Let me start it off by saying the customer service here is fantastic. They are warm and friendly. The atmosphere of the restaurant was classy and had a nice Italian feeling to it. The path to bathroom was unpleasant, the bathroom is side by side with the dishwashing space so you would feel hot steam and smell some weird odour coming to and from the bathrooms. The bathroom itself is nice though. The food here tasted amazing but it came in small portions and a heavy price. Overall, it was a great experience to try one of the many restaurants in Unionville, but it's a first and last time for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, well portioned, well prepared and presented. Owners and staff treat you like you're family. When I travel to Markham on business, this is where I go first. Simply outstanding!"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Dishes were pricey but food was good. My husband and I especially loved the beef carpaccio appetizer. Both of our mains were satisfactory. The fusilli with beef tenderloin was saucy and cooked well, the beef tenderloin entree was reasonably proportioned. I was disappointed that both my first choices were not available at the time (kitchen did not have veal or osso bucco). We each had  Prosecco at $10 per glass (perfect choice that night). 

Facility: We were seated on the patio which was large and spacious. Seating was comfortable and by night fall, they switch on some romantic mood lighting. Originally they were going to seat us indoors (in a little corner), but we opted for the patio. It was chilly but definitely worth the switch. It was quieter, more romantic and airy.

Service: Our servers were attentive and accommodating. Absolutely no complaints about it. They kindly took photos for us and cleared away dishes efficiently. 

Overall: We had a lovely experience at Il Postino and were very glad to have tried it here. It's a great place to dine at least once. I am unsure if we would return however as the experience didn't leave a remarkable impression. I wouldn't object to returning but wouldn't seek it out for exceptional quality food or service. Perhaps lunch would be better?

As I am unable to leave half stars, I rated Il Postino a 3.5/5, rounded up for how much my husband liked it."}
{"text":"Thought it was just OK.  Had the special, a lobster pasta, and it wasn't all that great.  I've heard great things about this restaurant so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing..."}
{"text":"This place I find to be ok. For the price I would expect more of it. The pizzas seem to be lacking in quality ingredients and the food to be average. I will say the staff and service is exception here though! 
I personally would stay away from the pizzas. Grilled calamari is really good!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant was very inviting and warm. Our host was very kind and definitely gave us a great experience. Customer service was really good and I'd give that alone 5 stars. 

The food itself was okay. I found it nice but a bit bland for me. A bit on the expensive side but the experience was nice. I may or may not go back depending on if I'm in the area again. 

The decor was very nice."}
{"text":"If you are used to eating at restaurant in this price range I suggest you stay away, the meal started off great with the appetizers but was all down hill from there

My dinner party sent back 2 platters and they were as simple as steak and salmon, all under seasoned and brought out cold

The penne alla vodka was terrible, a dish as simple as this and it was almost inedible (on my life)

I will say the bruschetta and the cocktail menu were decent 

Like I said if you are eating in this price range this isn't for you"}
{"text":"This is literally the BEST Italian restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of dining at in my entire life.

The entire menu is AMAZING, the bruschetta is OUTSTANDING, the seafood platter is OUTRAGEOUS as usually and the entrees and STUPENDOUS.  The wine list is TREMENDOUS and Joesph is one of the best servers I have ever met.

I would come back here a THOUSAND times if I could.../"}
{"text":"First time in unionville. Came to this restaurant for a work event; we booked the entire top level for our group. Such a classy restaurant in a wonderful little town. The highlights of the evening were the black angus Striploin and sea bass. Both dishes were well prepared and delicious! I'd highly recommend getting the tiramisu for dessert if they have it on their regular menu. 

I will definitely come back to try some other dishes at this restaurant. 4 stars instead of 5 because the service is a bit slow. But if you go with good companion, and order a glass of wine, it shouldn't be much of a problem."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the week - good service and cute atmosphere. For food, my girlfriend and I got the bruschetta (I'd say skip - tasted ok but nothing special), calamari (great texture; creamy & lightly battered), risotto balls (recommend! Who doesn't love risotto?!), Fusilli pasta (highly recommend, one of my new faves), and the prosciutto and arugula pizza (skip! Dough was soggy and tough. Very bland). Overall had a great time, average price for an Italian restaurant in my opinion - spent about $120 and had a beer each with all this food. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and each time sadly disappointed. The food is good and so is the service BUT the pricing is an issue. Sea bass is often a special at about $40 a plate. They serve Basa not sea bass as they refer to their special . Basa is not even in the sea bass family. It is an easy and light white fish that runs about $8 a lb. Sea bass runs at close to $50. I was told by a server that you won't see you main course until the bill average is $100 a person. That has always proven true. Last night was my last chance at this family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night. weather was amazing so everyone was out and about. We made a reservation and did not get seated until 40 minutes later. There were empty tables but maybe not enough servers? 

Before we even sat down I ordered the appetizers right away. It took then another 20-25 minutes for them to come around and offer us drinks and order food. All along we had no server and were just left there. Take note that there were still empty tables.

We ordered the carpaccio, calamari, rack of lamb, risotto with chicken and a prosciutto pizza. The appetizers were ALRIGHT, nothing special. The rack of lamb was also alright. The prosciutto pizza I found very unauthentic. The dough was so thick with just ingredients slapped on. The risotto was a complete nightmare.. There were probably four spoonfuls of it. It was not cooked correctly and had no flavour AT ALL and was just drenched in sauce. It was also undercooked. 

I would never go back to this place. Reason why its so busy is cause its in main street and has a patio."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday based on the great reviews from yelpers, and it completely lives up to the hype!

This place was packed on a Wednesday -- even the little bar they have was busy. For a pretty expensive place to be so busy on a weekday in the 905 is impressive. It's in a big renovated heritage home, so the atmosphere is pretty cozy. There 's also a small patio out front right on Main Street which I'm sure would be great in the summer. 

The service is friendly and attentive. Our server was great!

In terms of the food, I had the baked brie to start, which came with an assortment of berries and was very delicious. For the entree, I had the black angus striploin steak. I usually don't order steak unless I'm in an actual steakhouse, which is a good rule of thumb a friend once told me, but given the great reviews I'd read on yelp, I decided to give it a try. Boy, was I'm glad I did! The meat was perfectly done and very tender. It was complemented very well by the peppercorn glaze ,which used just the right amount of pepper. I tried some of my wife's duck, and it was also very well prepared.

All in all, we were very impressed with this restaurant and will definitely return."}
{"text":"4.5 stars - extra half for beer selection.

Easily the best Italian restaurant in Markham. Excellent food and fantastic service in historic Unionville - all makes for a great evening.

Like most of the establishments in the area, the restaurant is a beautiful old home converted into a restaurant. Huge patio in front is a real bonus. The only negative is that the tables are very close together and it got rather loud. For a while, it felt like I was part of 3 different conversations.

Service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and eager to answer our questions. She checked in on us multiple times even though they were super busy. The owner checked in on us as well to make sure we enjoyed our meal.

I'm not a wine drinker so I was incredibly pleased to see they had a decent beer selection, I certainly didn't see that coming. On tap: Leffe Brune, Leffe Blonde and Hoegarden. That's better than 99% of Markham pubs!

Food was excellent. For starters we had the Bruschetta and Grilled Calamari. The bruschetta was very good, they used fresh sweet cherry tomatoes. The grilled calamari was cooked perfectly and served on a bed of small potato / pork pieces.

The Mains were also top notch. The seafood linguini included al dente home made linguini and the freshest seafood (shrimp, mussels, calamari and scallops).  The farfalle with grilled chicken was really good - I love the combo of Black olives and sun dried tomatoes.       

The desserts are recommended. Amazing Tiramisu and chocolate torte with homemade Banana Gelato. Portions are light, a nice way to finish the meal.

A great overall experience and I will be back for sure. Prices are on the higher end, $30 - $40 for mains but they use the freshest ingredients and everything is prepared from scratch - the way it should be. Highly recommended.

{"text":"Likes:
- Great food! Although we only tried 2 of their pastas, I don't think you can go wrong with any of the other pasta options.
- Service is very warm and attentive. The servers came by our table after each dish to make sure we were doing okay. Our favourite part was the complimentary garlic bread being served out of the oven shortly after we got our appetizer. 

Dislikes: 
- Dessert portions were small for the price, but no biggie. 

We ordered the following:

- Reisling ($12/glass) - The wine menu is relatively small if you order by the glass, but they have many bottle options available.

- Burrata ($19)  - This was one of the specials for the night and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The fresh burrata was creamy, buttery and absolutely heavenly.

- Tagliatelle Ragu ($23) - This pasta dish was very delicious. I really liked how the tagliatelle was thin yet wide, so it was great for holding the well-seasoned and rich tomato based meat sauce.   

- Penne Alla Vodka ($26) - This is one of our go-to dishes at Italian restaurants as the use of vodka and proscuitto in the sauce just packs it with flavour. The creamy tomato sauce makes the pasta a bit on the heavier side, but it's well worth it.

- Tiramisu ($12) - The tiramisu is made in house and we enjoyed the creamy dessert. The mascarpone cheese whip was nice and light, and the sweetness nicely balanced with the coffee flavours. For $12, we did find the dessert to be a bit small.

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience here and would definitely return for our date nights!"}
{"text":"This review is based just on service, as we didn't even get to try the food!

We showed up without a reservation to eat dinner on the patio, but they were quite busy. I didn't expect it to be as busy as it was on a weeknight, but ended up waiting a bit to see what would happen. There were a couple open tables on the patio, so we thought we'd get a seat somewhere. After waiting a couple minutes, one server ended up coming up to us and explaining that she would return after a bit to see what she had available. She didn't come back for 5+ minutes later, saying there was nothing on the patio. We finally agreed to sit inside, and she put us at a table in the back. 

We started looking at the menus, but no one came to our table after being seated. About 10 minutes later, she said she needed some of the menus from our table since we were waiting on a couple of people. I then asked her for some water at that point (since we hadn't even gotten that), where she said okay but never returned, again!

They didn't have that many servers working at the time, but completely neglecting our table for more than 15 minutes is unacceptable. Even though the restaurant may have been busier than they expected for a Wednesday night, there is no excuse for the complete lack of service! We didn't even get water after I explicitly asked for some!

We ended up just walking out, and I doubt they even noticed! I will not be returning here, as I don't really enjoy the idea of coming to a nicer restaurant to be ignored!"}
{"text":"Great location -- in the middle of Unionville historic Centre street

Excellent food -- osso bucco is full of flavour and melting tender, one of the best!  Lamb chops grilled to medium-rare perfection; both cod and sea bass dishes were well executed too, for the fish lovers in our party.  Outstanding apps include the baked Brie (silken smooth Brie in a crispy phyllo envelop), and carpaccio.  For a sweet ending, molten chocolate cake is irresistibly delicious; pecan and bourbon tart is a nice refinement of the traditional pecan pie.  

Superb service -- attentive and discreet at the same time, our water glasses are never less than half-full, you certainly feel the warmth and welcome when dining here.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"In the heart of historic Unionville this restaurant has a lovely layout that makes you feel welcome the moment you walk in.

Warm friendly environment with alcoves make for a more intimate dinning experience, that is also great for a group outing.

Great micro brew beers. The Blonde ???beer  I had was wonderful. Lunch specials were tasty and affordable"}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  Pasta was absolutely delicious and the pizza had the right amount of topping and sauce/cheese.  Service was good as the water was refilled without needing to ask.  They came to check up often to ensure the dining experience was a pleasant one."}
{"text":"Right in the centre of main st unionville, can't believe I haven't tried this place as it's been open for years! The food was amazing! Pasta was al detente and savoury. Has the fusilli beef and it was probably one of the best pastas I have ever had. Portion size is on the smaller scale. Also tried the penne ala vodka which I thought was good too but nothing drool worthy. For apps, I tired the calamari which was grilled, also ok but lacking in flavour. The potatoes that came with the fish were seasoned very well. 

Overall would definitely be back to try out their other menu items. 

Note: book reservations- small restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a great experience from start to finish.  The service is attentive, but not overbearing and the food is great.

I came in with a group of 6 colleagues on a weekday night.  Our reserved table was ready for us when we arrived.  The menu offered a great selection of items and we all had trouble narrowing down to just a single choice.  Everyone started off with appetizers to get a chance at a wider selection from the menu.

First off, the mixed seafood appetizer is more like a seafood feast.  It is a giant plate of shrimp and scallops.  Well worth the price tag and easily could have gone for more.  I had the mozzarella salad.  Hard to mess this one up and they didn't.

For my main I got the seafood linguine.  It was excellent.  To be honest, I was a little let down by the amount of seafood.  Considering how much was in the seafood appetizer, I was expecting a hefty portion.  I would have liked a few more scallops and shrimp.

For dessert, I got the bourbon pecan pie.  HOLY SMOKES!  It was AWESOME.  I cut out sweets a while back, but I broke my diet when I heard this was on the menu.  I'm so happy I did.  Every aspect of it was great!  

This is a short review because I don't think much is needed.  The restaurant is great, the service is great and you should definitely give it a try.  Great for groups and the kitchen is well equipped to handle it."}
{"text":"Charming little Italian restaurant on Main Street. Great location.
The house is quite charming but historic as a few things are either discoloured or super sticky but with the romantic decor and colourful interior designing that can be dismissed.

I sat near the wall painting with the blue skies and hot air balloon trinkets hanging above. It was cute.

BRUSCHETTA $6 vine ripened tomatoes, garlic, basil, olive oil
Comes with 2 pieces but the cherry tomatoes were sweet and beautiful. Loved this

ARUGULA SALAD $12 pecans, grapes, parmesan
The portion was just enough. The parmesan wasn't as sharp as I'd like it to be but the arugula was nice and grassy.

CAESAR SALAD $13 romaine, parmesan, toasted croutons
The dressing was very tangy and different from the usual caesar salad. Kind of pickley and sour. It didn't suit my taste but my friend enjoyed it

LINGUINE WITH SEAFOOD $32 calamari, mussels, shrimp, scallops, light tomato sauce
When they mean light, they mean it. It was barely tomatoey and possibly really buttery. The linguine was cooked well. And the seafood was really REALLY good! I usually don't eat seafood because they seem to always taste rubbery but it went pleasantly with this dish

This restaurant has a good supplier of fresh ingredients, which is probably why the price tag is steeper. Paying for quality food"}
{"text":"We were visiting Markham for a conference. We somehow ended up here for dinner. We liked it so much we decided to come back the following evening.

Melanie and her family run a warm and welcoming restaurant. The food was definitely delicious. I had a bone-in fillet one night which was cooked perfectly. Fresh grilled squid which can be easy to screw up arrived toasted yet soft. They happily substituted brocolli rabe instead of the potatoes on my main course. 

Melanie provides a great warm personality to really make you have a great time and want to come back. I'd definitely go back and visit when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Pros:

Good food - had beef carpaccio and beef salad. Beef carpaccio was soft and flavourful. Beet salad was nicely seasoned and soft. Mushroom pizza was delicious.

Food came quickly.

We had a cake for my friend's bday. They brought it out and cut it for us. Nice touch and no plating fee.

Waiters were friendly.

Ways to improve:
They were late with our reservation. Waited 10 minutes before we got our table.
We waited awhile before our drinks were served. 
Washrooms are located in a weird location, downstairs, next to kitchen. They have washrooms upstairs but I didn't seem them.
Apparently there is parking behind the restaurant, but it wasn't listed on the website. Would be nice if it was listed. 

Definitely good for a party. Food is pricey - ranges from $20 to 40 for each main, but pretty big portions."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my best friend. It was a last get together before she went on her vacation overseas. We got seated fairly quickly, and was seated on the patio. They brought our drinks, bread, and our appetizer on timely manner. 
So why the 1 star?? 

Our entree never came. We are very patient people as I do work in the same industry so I understand how it is. But if we wait for an hour, and nobody checks on us or even notices that we've been sitting there with no food on our table at all for an hour, that's a problem. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited for an hour. Then, we asked them if our food was coming, because it's been an hour since we finished our appetizer. The server told us that the reason why it took so long was because the kitchen was backed up and lost the chit, so I asked her why no one EVER came to check up on us for an hour, and she replied that it looked like we were having too much fun to bother. We were LITERALLY ON OUR PHONE for good 30 min at one point waiting for food, and I was extremely upset that she made everything sound like it was our fault. I just didn't say anything at that point because I could feel myself getting really upset and I didn't want to make a scene on my best friends last night. The food came, and it was bland. I ordered fettuccini funghi, and It didn't taste like anything. It was just spicy for no reason.  I asked for salt and it was a little better but still extremely disappointing. They ended up comping our entree and paid more attention to us than in the beginning, probably only because we complained. When we were trying to figure out the bill, She came to check 
On us once to see if we needed the machine, and when we told her to come back in couple of minutes, she never came back. Instead, we found her sitting with her co workers chatting two tables beside us. The AUDACITY!! Despite the horrible experience, we were still going to tip her because it's horrible not to tip. But that was the last straw. We didn't want to wait anymore so we just paid in cash and barely tipped. It was so bad that we went to another bar next door to get another drink, because we really needed it after this experience. We received a great service in the bar next door, and happily tipped 20%. Never coming back to this restaurant ever again. They should really re-train their staffs."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Italian spot in Markham/ Unionville then Il Postino will be the spot! I had the Seafood Linguine and it was alright, the mussels in it was a bit soggy for my liking but be calamari was good. My boyfriend had the fusilli beef and I felt that the pasta was a bit too hard. We ordered the tiramisu after as part of our dessert and that was really really good!"}
{"text":"One of the greatest restaurants in Unionville. Not too many options for Vegans but the service was spectacular. The owner is lovely and so attentive. The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the prices are a bit steep considering the portion sizes. More of a gourmet type fancy Italian restaurant than a homestyle, hefty-portions Nonna's style that leave you satiated. The wine list is great and the bruschetta is the best I've ever tasted. The tomatoes are well marinated and the baguette slices are grilled to perfection, nice and toasty. All in all, one of my favorite spots on Main Street, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here to eat on a weekday night. We were greeted by a wonderful girl, wish I had gotten her name but she was really the saving grace of this entire experience. Super friendly, always attentive, I'd give her a 5 star rating alone. I believe she was actually the hostess that served us, not sure why, but she seemed to be doing more than the servers honestly. 

Food was.. OKAY. Definitely not worth the price point. Our app was the charcuterie board, which was good. Then it went down hill from there. We got the pollo pizza which tasted more like a pita with chicken and cheese on top. Very bland and salty?? And a (forgot what it was called) pasta dish with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes, very plain and again VERY bland, literally no flavour. One thing I will say is that the food is obviously extremely fresh but lacks so much flavour which is so sad. Service 10/10, food 3/10. Would only go back for apps and drinks, nothing more."}
{"text":"Very nice Italian restaurant, this is my second time come to this restaurant. I like their food and it is close to my home."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian in Unionville. Really no complaints about this place. Food is bomb, service is impeccable, wine is just right. They have a private dining room upstairs for larger parties. Saw couples, families, everybody! I will come here again and again! Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Went there for a business lunch with 18 other colleagues. Every single dishes we ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch.
Prices are on the high side but the quality definitely makes up for the high prices.
Small but cozy setup with a bar near the entrance and a few tables towards the back.

Meal comes with complementary bread and balsamic.

For starters we got the grilled calamari $15. The calamari was really fresh and it was grilled to perfection. Not too rubbery but with a nice bite to it.

For the main course we got the following:

Seafood Risotto $26 - once again the seafood was really fresh consisting of 2 pieces of squid, shrimp and scallop. The risotto was a bit on the salty side and I found the overall dish to be a bit small for the price.

Wild mushroom pizza $16 - good crunch bite to the crush with tons of mozzarella cheese. About the size of a dinner plate or 4 large slices of pizza. It was not a thin crust nor was a pan dish pizza so you can say its your typical medium thickness pizza. 

The service was very friendly and attentive.

Overall a very good meal but nothing that really got me excited and the price is a bit on the steep side so I would give it a solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"As others have noted, this isn't the cheapest Italian you can get, but for those looking for heft per dollar spent, there's always East side marios.

Came here on a whim on a Friday night (about 7:30?) without reservations and we were seated fairly soon.  Ordered the grilled calamari, seafood linguine and the ragu. My dining partner also ordered a glass of the Angel's Gate Riesling which she enjoyed.  The calamari was great - nice grilled flavour and it was tender with just a little bite to it (as opposed to overly mushy chemically tenderized meat).  I had the ragu which had a fantastic meaty flavour - it's a meat sauce with some tomato flavour as opposed to a tomato sauce with meat. I enjoyed it. And my partner thoroughly enjoyed the seafood linguine, noting that things were seasoned and cooked well.

I would recommend it for the great food that we had. Again, price isn't on the cheap side. And I have no issue with the noise.  I did glance over at the table next to us at the lamb that was ordered; seems cooked more than I would like but perhaps he ordered it like that? It still looked good however.

I wish I could comment on the decor. I was there maybe 80 mins and focused on my companion and the Leafs/caps game on the tv once in a while.  Still enjoyed the evening overall.

PS. The entrees came out a bit slower than I would have expected and if we were really hungry I think we wouldn't have been so kind. But the kitchen and the wait staff were definitely busy that evening and not being inefficient."}
{"text":"Il Postino is a lovely two story restaurant in the heart of Unionville with a great patio and lots of parking.  I have been to this restaurant on a few occasions and it is very consistent.  The service is always amazing, the staff is extremely welcoming, the menu remains the same and the food is okay."}
{"text":"Primarily low for terribly slow service and tiny portion sizes on the appetizers given the high price.  We waited a long time to be acknowledged by the waitress and were never!! We asked for services from someone passing who then turned into our server.  For such a restaurant they don't have it together.  The waitress apologized and suggested we give our entire order immediately because they're so busy to prepare it.  Once we got apps, we waited over an our for our entrees.  Tables around us were also waiting.  The restaurant doesn't have it together.  Poor value and poor service .  I think if they had enough staff and upped their value it would be great"}
{"text":"Disappointing. 

At this price point, I was expecting much better service and food. We came here on a weeknight for a company dinner. Tea cup was dirty and needed to be replaced. Dishes were priced around $20-30 dollars.I personally was not impressed by the food. Folco's on Markham Main street is a much better alternative. 

Restaurant is dated. Do not bring your date here."}
{"text":"If you're ever craving Italian in Markham, I would definitely recommend this place. I come here quite often and am almost always satisfied, I don't remember the names of the dishes so bare with me. I personally like their pasta with lobster which I don't believe is on the menu so you'll have to ask if they have it. My second favorite is the pasta with sausage. I tried the pasta with chicken recently and found there was way too much oil. If you're not in the mood for pasta, the lamb is also really good. They also have steak but I wouldn't recommend it. Now onto dessert and my favorite item on the menu by far.... drum roll.. Creme Brule! They have probably the best creme brule I've ever had! If you go here you must try it! The chocolate cake with vanilla icing is really good too but the creme brule is a must-try!"}
{"text":"A lot of fries and mosquitoes, portion size is small... food I give ...5/10..for 1.5hour no other customer came in."}
{"text":"LOVE the seafood platter from here! Came back a week later to have it again. On the pricier side but worth it!

For the main course, I had the graganelli pasta. The mozzarella di bufula complemented the rose sauce perfectly. I will probably become a regular .

Service was great! the place was cute and cozy, going with the overall mainstream unionville look and feel. Take a look up at the light shades when you're waiting for your food to arrive ."}
{"text":"A very small, quaint that does the farm to table menu.    Since there wasn't that many people on a monday night, we had great service.    I would categorize the food as american/canadian/international, meat and potatoes or fish and rice (all locally sourced with exceptional cooking techniques).     Would I go back?  Hmm....  I'd had a lot of places like this in my life and although good, there wasn't an iconic experience or dish."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! its just down right awsome! I live in the area and its by far one of the best bone in steaks in Markham. Staff is friendly and very helpful. Ive been here on a few dates and its the perfect spot. I've also come by with the guys after hockey and its a hit, portion sizes are Perfect!!"}
{"text":"This authentic Italian at its best. From the you're here you're family attitude of the hostess and her staff to the stellar flavours the two sons and amazing chefs whip up in the kitchen. The pasta menu is renowned... You have to try their grilled calamari, it's a must. 

Another favorite of mine is their Lamb chops and also the Osso Buco. 

I have taken my clients there for over 4 years now and their service and food has been consistently brilliant each time."}
{"text":"In charming Unionville, you'll find Il Postino, by far the best Italian Restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I have been here on two occasions, and on both occasions everyone in our party just *loved* the food."}
{"text":"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. It has stood the test of time and remains one of Unionville Mains top stops for food. 

However, that being said, it is beginning to show its age and I have noticed over the years that the food quality and overall experience at the restaurant has slowly but surely declined, more so each time I visit. 

Personally I feel it is because of the \"hype\" that Unionville Main now has.. the last couple years, any weekend it's been packed. And I feel that when people are flocking in, regardless of how attentive you are as a restaurant, the overall presentation declines and corners are cut. 

The food here has gone from really good, to honestly hit and miss. It's not horrible, or disgusting. But like others have suggested, for the price point you will be paying here, there are a lot more alternatives in Markham, but not Main itself. 

For Italian it's between this place and La Grotta. Save your tastebuds and try this place out. Just be prepared to overpay for mediocre food that's sometimes cold and flavourless."}
