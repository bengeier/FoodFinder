{"text":"Glad to see the place reopen as 2601!  The staff is very friendly and the food fits the description.  It is great comfort food.  Me and a co-worker had the bacon wrapped meatloaf sandwich which we both thought wa excellent. We will be back with other co-workers."}
{"text":"This place was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix. We went to see a Gary Allan concert and this place was across the street from our Hotel. We went for a late lunch before the concert and we were so impressed with the service and food, we went back after the concert. Seriously good eats and the staff was just delightful! I also loved the urban decor."}
{"text":"We came here on Friday night at 8:00 and while it was empty, I never focused on that.  I am here to eat, not be wowed by how many people are there. The food was great.  The wait staff was nice.  The paintings were nice but not worth increasing or decreasing my stars for."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour, and so glad we decided to try it! I really like the ambiance and location. The happy hour menu is good, but the food tasted better! I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Slammed for first big brunch event today. Food good, service sparse. Owner went a long ways to make up for issues. It's our neighborhood. Thank you we will be back."}
{"text":"Recently visited 2601 on Central and the place was empty which for a Friday at lunch time seems odd. Food was good service was good however I was charged higher amounts than advertised on the menu. Brought this to servers attention who advised me all kinds of paperwork would need to be done to refund my money. Reaching into the register and giving me the difference was not an option apparently. 

Will I return ? Probably not? 

CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our server was lydell and he was awesome. The food was solid. I had the meatloaf sandwich and others at the table had the Mac and cheese, grilled cheese with soup, and the wings. The only thing I felt was a little miss was the soup as it was a bit over acidic for my taste, but most of the table really liked it. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Where to start. Went here last week with some friends. Great location and decor. Unfriendly, inexperienced, untrained staff. The menu itself proves a lack of experience, vision, and originality. I can get the same food and drinks a stones throw in any direction. If you're going to open up a restaurant in one of the largest growing culinary scenes on the west coast, at least try to do it half right. The tacos can only be compared to reheated Filiberto's which are perfect for a late night drive though after the bar at most. Inexperience showed not only in the dining room but from the kitchen as well, why advertise as \"American\" and serve 95% international cuisine not to mention prepared improperly. Bruschetta, tacos, hummus, various salsas, guacamole, couscous, chorizo, spaghetti, tabbouleh. Yawn.. nothing unique or original or flavorful. Was hoping the new kids on the block would add to the excitement of the downtown culinary scene. but alas, just another sad hipster attempt at reinventing the wheel."}
{"text":"Was super excited become try this place Saturday night you would think this place would be packed walked and door there was one table sat down took a while to get the  The server She suggested the house Margarita boy that was the most disgusting thing I ever had it takes like sour mix and straight  Salt  I never waste alcohol but that I cannot drink I tried given to my cousin he took one sip  I will spit it out told the survey I don't like it she suggested to add more syrup no way  She did take it off the bill which was good I ordered  The shrimp tacos they were decent something you get from rubio's  I think they're a little pricey for what you get Server  Did not
 come to table much she just talked to another server at the bar  Unfortunately I never go back this place would great potential if  did things better"}
{"text":"First time in 2601 was an excellent experience. Staff was very friendly and attentive...the service was excellent. 

I ordered huevos rancheros and a truffle coffee cocktail both of which were fantastic. I will definitively visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Used my Groupon (still available for sale) with 3 others girls from work. We arrived shortly after they opened so we were the only ones in the place. The  inside is very nice and very comfortable. We had a great waiter on on only his second day. He was very friendly and one of the happiest servers I seen in a long time. For starters we ordered the guacamole and chips (8.95) and the chips and salsa (free as they should be). The chips were very good as was the salsa. NOTE: they have a hotter sauce which was ok, but I mixed it with the other and the taste got better, mmmm! We ordered the chicken mole, carne asada tacos, the red chicken enchilada and the combo plate. MOLE reported it was awesome, ASADA liked the tacos but said they needed salt, RED loved hers, but was kind of skimpy on the sauce and COMBO said everything was good except the cheese crisp. They should use a moister cheese, maybe jack? Service was very good and very well spaced out. We never felt like we were ignored which is refreshing these days. Overall a great experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great location.
The staff were friendly and consistent.

The food was sooo good! Have to try the asada and tinga tacos!! 

For sure going to come back."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place and hope they step up their game and become a good addition to the neighborhood. Service was slow, prices were high and the menu is limited. We had cocktails which were nothing special. We shared an appetizer (bruschetta) and it was a good size portion, but really bland and uninteresting. 

We will only try it again if neighbors start telling us they have enjoyed it, but I don't expect this place will last. It just doesn't feel like it fits with our midtown culture and what we expect from neighborhood spots."}
{"text":"Popped in on Saturday afternoon for a tide over appetizer.  Had my favorite IPA (Dragoon) and the margarita was perfect.  Shared a cheesesteak, better than most."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is AMAZING! Love the atmosphere! Thanks for a great time! I am super thrilled we came to this place!! Lots of events and stuff to do! And great happy our prices! Danny is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Place was empty, probably because they have zero street presence on a main street like Central Ave.  Staff was courteous and professional.

Started with flight of bruschetta which was really good and filling.  Almost thought two appetizers and a drink and I might have been good to go.  Next was the homestyle meatloaf with a flavorful spicy sauce, onion straws, with mashed potatoes and choice of veg (I got roasted brussel sprouts).  Meatloaf itself was good, but unfortunately it was drowning in the sauce.  Maybe I'm being picky but I would have loved to see it hit the flat top and crusted on both sides with about half the sauce.  Other dish we ordered was the NY strip with roasted vegetables and asked for it medium rare.  IT CAME OUT BLUE. Literally looked like seared tuna.  I would be they tried cooking it frozen.  It was not even hot enough to melt the butter they placed on top of it.   Then the server disappeared for 15 minutes.   We finished the bruschetta and shared the meatloaf and various vegetables.

Took the  NY strip home for dinner the next night, tossed it in a pan for a few minutes each side and cooked it to medium rare.  Should have taken a picture to show what medium rare actually looks like.

Price point did not match the end result.  Unforunately, I think this place is making it by barely but if they can't turn tables on a Saturday night it's going to be a short lived performance."}
{"text":"It was really that bad.  Out of flour tortillas, had to wait for chips to be fried.  The shrimp entr√©e was so spicy and had tons of this thick hot sauce all over it.  Waitress was young and friendly.  I just will never go back to this place again.   We went when it was something before this, should of known."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Space is nice. Food was a bit above average. Flatbread was a room temp piece of bread with various toppings. Fine but nothing great. Service needed fine tuning. I'd really like a restaurant to work in this space, but this one needs some work if it's going to last."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Saturday. The place had only 4 other guests enjoying food. I guess this is still a relatively new restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful with pressed tin ceiling and exposed brick. And the staff was super friendly. The food was mediocre. I had Eggs Benedict which were average. I wish this restaurant success. It's tuff to be a new kid on the block. I would recommend more pizzazz on the menu and bigger cups for coffee!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood place listened to its customers and learned the needs of the area.  They are now strictly a Mexican menu.  Not wanting to compete with the restaurant next door, they did a 180.  And I am so glad they did.  There are tons of Mexican restaurants downtown.  But nothing midtown.  Great menu.  Great specials.  And try the lavender/sage/peppercorn infused margarita.  OMG!  Still the great staff from before.  We love Lydell!  And Heidi!  Support this place.  I love being able to walk across the street for great Mexican food.  Oh...and the queso chorizo dip?  To die for!"}
{"text":"I will definitely back! The service was friendly, genuine, and on point. Luna and Amanda made it such a great experience. Their menu waa great. I recommend the bruschetta board...oh yummy. They have plenty of vegetarian options which is a major plus."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food is great.  The brunch service needs A LOT of help.  We were there with a large group on Sunday morning.  The server waiting on us also had to make all the drinks for the table (20 people)??? There were at least 3-4 people working, but not one of them helped her.  This is the 2nd time this has happened to our group. Very very slow service.  Bigger coffee cups too please.  Hope it gets better."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I got the enchiladas verde for brunch and OMG I totally recommend. Also they have delish mimosas, get the $10 bottle and share with your friend. The parking is easy. The atmosphere is good. I can't believe there were only 6 patrons in the whole place on a Sunday. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink one night before heading out to dinner.  The place was extremely quiet during happy hour and there wasn't much of an ambiance at the time.  The bartenders were friendly and made a tasty mule with rhubarb and fennel - unique and delicious!  The menu seemed pretty basic too.  Hopefully they can find their niche and make a name in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love their Martini flights. I would of given this place 3 stars because the service was so slow BUT they we're new so I understand. The hamburger was delicious."}
{"text":"I contemplated for a while... 3 stars? 4? I'm gonna go with 5 because although the food was not perfect at all, this was a good experience overall. It was almost empty when we arrived, which is always concerning, but later in the evening I saw more tables filling in. We had a Groupon, and that was welcomed kindly. So. We had plenty of items from the menu. The Sampler, the Tortilla Soup, the Queso, the Tacos, the Well Margarita, the Enchiladas, but our favorite were the basics... The chips and salsa. The best I've had. The most expensive dish. Was a total fail. Skip the shrimp and garlic item... It's a total bust, But hey, the way it all got handled got the extra points. So overall, it's good to give local businesses like this a try. They appreciate your business and do their best, and who knows if you may find the best chips and salsa you've had for a while."}
{"text":"I have visited This establishment three times now and I have always enjoyed it. It is a very calm, relaxing , modern and trendy atmosphere. I have tried their santa fe chicken sandwich , chorizo fries and their grilled cheese. All delicious. They also serve very good bloody Mary's and mimosas which I accidentally lost the picture of. Our orders didn't take long and staff was super welcoming I recommend this place for brunch or group dining"}
{"text":"Really fun and friendly place to have a good time. The food was delicious and fairly priced. Our waiter Daniel was just great. Definitely worth a try, $2 Corona's a good deal!"}
{"text":"I attended the Big Gay Brunch on Sunday and it was ah-mazing!!!  The ladies putting on the show were outstanding and were awesome with my kiddo. Food was good and reasonably priced. $10 champagne bottle special and $6 Bloody Mary bar. I didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"Solid hot and new place, so I'm happy to jack up a recommendation to check it out!! 

Four of us stopped in to eat, super hangry, and loudly arguing with our friend who wanted to lecture us. I was skeptical to sit indoor because I was ready to talk over people, but with respect to others. The staff was dope as soon as we stepped in. They initially offer to sit on the patio, but it was \"up to y'all\"

We walked in to a great space with booths and seating for people to be comfortable however needed.

Our server got us started with two bottles of mimosas with OJ and pineapple. The manager also came by to welcome us, and answer any questions we had. I would say the brunch menu wasn't too convincing, and the server kept it real with us; so we opened our minds to the full menu which has great variety.

I would like to add that our server was a cool personable dude the entire way, dropping by to laugh with our argument, and chime in on some cool discussion questions we had for him along the way. He reminded us we could stay as long as we needed and didn't rush out out while we finished our bottles.

My brother ordered the loaded tots, which he cleaned the plate before I could get a pic, my buddies ordered the burger, and meatloaf; respectively. 

I ordered the Mac and cheese with salmon, and must say it was well done. Creamy, brunch style Mac with a great piece is salmon that was well flavored! I was able to enjoy salmon with every bite of my Mac and cheese which was nice. 

My buddy made a decent observation about the meat loaf: \"it tastes like it was cooked three different ways in the same time to get the texture and flavor it had. A little small for the 16 bucks, but very good on the flavor etc! 

I would absolutely come here again without question when I'm back in Phoenix!! Salute 2601!!"}
{"text":"I went in here looking for a great neighborhood place that I could walk to whenever I felt like not cooking. What I found was just another restaurant.

The staff was very friendly. The food was good. But the overall experience was just \"meh\"

My first impression wasn't the best. A filthy menu is not how you woo your customers. Come on, it is made on paper, you probably can print them in your office. Throw it away when someone spills their meal on it.

Now taking into account I arrived shortly after 4pm I don't expect the place to be packed, but this place was dead. Only 4 other customers were in there and though very friendly, the staff reflected the slow ambiance. The pace of service was very slow considering they didn't really have much to do. And 4pm starts 2601's happy hour. I had to ask about it. 

My dinner, the meatloaf, was very good. Beef mixed with chorizo made for a bit of a bite. The accompanying mashed potatoes were good and hot and the side of roasted brussels sprouts were excellent. My Sazerac had a great taste, though it had no garnish. That could be a conscious decision but historically a Sazerac has a twist.

The rest of the menu was simply not inspiring. Both the cocktails and the dinning menu were basic american standards. I hope 2601 can find some inspiration.

I'd probably want to give them a 3.5 rating and would have rounded up to a 4 for the friendly staff but the first impression dinged 'em too much..."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all by this place. Wait staff has no idea what they are doing, food was disgusting, and the \"manager was very rude. We went to the \"Big Gay Brunch\" and it was absolutely terrible. There is a buffet for $15, which we got because when we asked if we could order off of a menu, they said they were short staffed, and it would take a while. The best thing on he menu was the $3 bottle of champagne and that wasn't even enough to wash down the taste of the eggs & bacon of the buffet. About an hour later they brought out chicken and corn tortillas to make \"tacos\". Won't be going back. I would try Switch literally 10 ft away, next door. It's cheaper and worth the money."}
{"text":"This new American bistro has recently opened in the space previously occupied Corduroy. The menu is just big enough to offer choices but not overwhelming. However, most choices are pretty heavy. But that's not a bad thing! If you're looking for meatloaf, mac and cheese, or grilled cheese, check it out."}
{"text":"This was definitely a strange experience, for the second time. The first time we went was maybe a week or 2 after they opened. The service was weird, we had a bartender who instead of taking orders was just cleaning glasses (they had plenty, we know cause we sat at the bar). What was meant to be a quick 15 minute drink stop, turned into an hour long drink stop (for 1 drink). We decided to give this place another shot, we walk in and the hostess/bartender says hold on let me see if the kitchen is still open and disappears into the back. Its 5:30pm on a Sunday, she comes back and has us seated and proceeds to tell us that the chef wasn't feeling way and was in the process of shutting down the kitchen.  Had a good deal on a Corona, $2. But other than that, we unfortunately crossed this place off our list."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple other times but this is the first since they went to a Mexican Food menu.  I think it was a good move considering there are not many others in the immediate area.  

Food was good and fresh. Service was very good.  It was not very busy.  They lack identity.  They don't market, exterior is dark, nothing to say, here we are!!   Hopefully they change that and survive.  

Worth a try."}
{"text":"Heidi is great and makes a fantastic old fashioned.  Airline chicken was exceptional. Have a few rare beers at Kings and walk down to 2601."}
{"text":"My first time here and had lovely servers, along with tasty food! They even accommodated my vegetarian diet and altered a plate on the menu for me. I had a torta ahogada with potatoes and beans, with a side of guacamole. The papa fritas were freshly made and crispy! Would come here every day if I lived in town! :)"}
{"text":"Well that went as expected, not good. My first impressions were bleak as no one to greet upon entrance , the wait seemed forever and the service was just as empty as the opened door.  The bar service was not impressed by any means ,  more to customer , don't argue with customers over the bill while others are watching or within war shot.   The simple sale was just that Simple and NO FRILLS  the \"steak\" was colder than the chopped lettuce and the grilled corn was rubbery and tasteless. The over seasoned dressing was way over spicy.  I should of left earlier but gave the simple salad a try .... nope I was wrong about this place and wish it luck with much better restaurants right up the street like the new Macayo's or even Mi Patio !  Good luck 2601..."}
{"text":"Went twice this week because I enjoyed it so much the first.

Unfortunately, the service for our 12 person group the second time was less than satisfactory.  Lots of kinks to work out or just add a few staff.

Food was good both times.

My party also experienced some wide variation on the cocktail prep.  Personalization is good for tattoos, but not for standard drinks."}
{"text":"Great place with cool atmosphere and two dollar Coronas! What's not to like? Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"We walked in thinking it was Corduroy, not realizing it's changed but we stayed to check it out. We had doubts since the place was empty and thought to go next door to Switch. We both got the Santa Fe Chicken sandwich and it sucked!! The menu read it was on Ciabatta but it came out on Texas type toast but zero flavor. The tiniest piece of chicken again with zero flavor. Super disappointing since the ridiculous sandwich with a lame, tasteless side salad was $11.50 and I could have grabbed some delicious grub next door at Switch for close to the same price. Unfortunately, their menu is basic and lame and so is the food."}
{"text":"There were only a few people there but it was a very peaceful experience. The setting and scenery was great, plenty of seating, and the server was extremely nice. They had $2 taco Tuesday. The carne Assad tacos were delicious and very filling. Lots of meat!! Beans and rice were also great. Overall it was a great first experience there and I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"The place was empty when we showed up. The people where nice as hell. The food was good. They sang Lionel Richie songs."}
{"text":"First timers.  Quiet night,  only a few here.  The menu is limited but it worked for us.  I had a burger and my spouse had Santa Fe chicken. Both were tasty. The burger was actually 2 burgers and juicy."}
{"text":"Danny was such an awesome waiter we loved the tacos the carne and the pescado were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We had been to this location as Cordoroy and found our first visit to 2601 to be equally as vacant. The place was trying to close up over two hours early because the chef wasn't feeling well and there weren't any customers when we arrived. After she assured us he would stay for us we sat, we felt extremely awkward that they wanted to go home and that the chef cooking our food was sick. We ordered a beer and margarita and split the queso. It was fine but not worth $9. We paid our bill and got out of there as quick as possible. I feel bad that the new restaurant and the recent re-branding can not get people in the door, perhaps it is this location that makes it difficult. It has all the bones to be a great restaurant but missed the mark for us."}
{"text":"2601 has great prices on food and drinks on their happy hour menu. The bruschetta sampler was very good! They also had a great dessert list but I was too full for dessert this visit. The staff was very sweet and courteous and they gave us a 15% off coupon to come back! We will have to return and use the coupon for dessert.... Overall 2601 has a fun atmosphere and great customer service and some tasty eats!!"}
{"text":"Fish and chicken el pastor tacos  are amazing very pleasant atmosphere. We will be back"}
{"text":"I was one of three tables in the entire place at 7pm on a Wednesday night. Very high prices. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs for $14, the portion size is a kids meal, i thought it was a joke. It became very clear why it is completely dead in here at dinner time. I had to order another meal because I was still hungry, and they're out of the bruschetta, on a night when no one is in here. Such a disappointment I feel bad for the servers because my server was amazing."}
{"text":"We were originally set to dine for lunch at Switch next door, but during the walk saw this new place and decided to give it a try. The inside was nicely decorated and the staff were very friendly. My friend ordered the stuffed cheeseburger and I got the loaded fries. Her plate was priced at $13 and mine was $11. So I'm thinking these fries are going to be loaded! 35 minutes later, with the restaurant having only 2 other tables occupied and over a dozen vacant, our food finally arrived. My friends burger came out looking fantastic and my loaded fries came out looking like an overdone Filiberto special. The cheese was over baked, topped with dry bacon and chorizo. The pico, as requested, was on the side, but looking at these fries (picture included) the word \"loaded\" did not come to mind. I feel for the price and time waited- this meal should have been delicious, but unfortunately mine was not. I am giving this restaurant a 3-star rating because I am taking into consideration all of the plates I saw going to the other tables looking amazing and my friend loved her cheeseburger. Please revamp your loaded fries!!"}
{"text":"We came here and we're pleasantly surprised they had molcajete on the menu. My husbands favorite and we were unable to find it on any Mexican menu in the area. This place is awesome. Great menu, friendly service, quality food. I ordered a margarita, and it had real lime ingredients! We sat indoor, but they do have a small cute patio. The seating was really comfortable and everything was super clean."}
{"text":"I came in for brunch this past Sunday and had an excellent experience. I had their Bloody Mary to start and have to say it was one of the better ones I've had as of late and my boyfriend got the flight of mimosas (choice of 3 from their list) and each one was tasty. I had their green chicken enchiladas from their brunch menu and they were not only delicious but quite filling, I had to share with friends since I couldn't finish them alone. The sauce was just the right amount of heat and the cheesy hash browns that they were on top of was a nice addition. The whole staff was very friendly and inviting, John was awesome! Overall this was one of the best brunch experiences I've had and this will be one of my go to brunch spots. I also can't wait to be back for dinner one of these nights."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today. Taco Tuesday..reviews said to def get the asada...they had NO ASADA and only enough albondias for 1 person...which was surprising cause they had only been open for 2 hrs. The chili rillenos had so many seeds. The service was super slow, I dont beleive we were ever checked on, more like we had to keep calling to them. The one person said the albondigas were real good..but they make the soup w potatoes instead of rice. We were told the sampler was made w shredded beef..NOT. It was made w chicken but it was ok. The guac was Sooo good! Overall id say it was ok...not planning on going back asap."}
{"text":"Sooo I came in the past Sunday for brunch. Place is cute. Not many people when I get there. 1 big table of like 12. And maybe 6 table of 2-3. We waited probably 20 mins before a server tried to get an order. We came for brunch. No champagne as they ran out. The GM had to rush over and bring some. From the Tea that I got. The owners really need to staff better. The GM very kindly stopped at each table to make sure people were happy. The manager did the same. I personally would give this a shot one more time. But the owners need to properly staff the establishment. If you plan on surviving in this area for the next year. You need to plan better.

Details of your incompetence bores me. You get a 3 based off your Manager and GM and that's all."}
{"text":"Atmosphere didn't live up to its potential. Food was ordinary too or maybe a tick above ordinary. However the prices are appropriate for atmosphere/quality of food. Easy option from the hotel I was staying at."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend and I first time coming here this evening and we were so impressed! The services that was done for us is very informative, so professional and we were clearly well taken care of. We left happily and just amazed! Well done!"}
{"text":"2601 took over from Corduroy which was one of my favorites so i was cautious about coming in here. I was pleasantly surprised to see just some small modifications to the floor plan, but super excited about the menu! We had the flatbread, dip trio and elote, which was all fantastic! 

Word of caution - they are slow on food delivery, wait staff was great and friendly, but the food took time getting out. We were there for 2 hours to just get apps / side dish."}
{"text":"Good menu and I have high hopes. Food was ok and had the potential to be better as they work out operational kinks. It's worth trying as they gain experience."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends today for their Big Gay breakfast. All you can eat buffet. The food was made from scratch and delicious. The green Chile chicken enchiladas have just the right amount of hot! We will be back again to try the tacos!"}
