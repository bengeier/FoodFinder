{"text":"Great AYCE, lovely management, and the lunch specials are inexpensive while filling and tasty.
I love the service here, even when it's busy the staff are quick, accommodating and polite.
Not a fan of their miso soup but their fish is incredibly fresh and the entrees are always ample. Plus the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We had AYCE dinner here and it was a surprisingly good.  The place was pretty dead when we went there and it was still lacking customers when we left.  We questioned the freshness of the fish and food, but in the end it didn't taste stale at all.

Service was good since we were practically the only ones there so attention was directed to us.

I would return, but it would be nice if there were more customers there so that we wouldn't be able to hear the staff's conversations and hearing ourselves munch on food."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with 1 waitress on a Sunday night. Only 3 tables served all night. $20 a person for AYCE dinner. First round of salmon sashimi was warm and pieces were sliced very small and thin. Second round of salmon sashimi was more fresh and chilled but still sliced very thin and small. Many things that were ordered did not arrive. Eel Dragon roll and eel on rice were pathetic - could barely see if there were any eel on it. Nothing stood out in this place. When compared to other AYCE places like Matsuda, this place falls way short."}
{"text":"The food is actually not bad considering how the dinner ayce price is actually very cheap. Around $22 a person including tax. The only part that was disappointing was how the service was really crappy and right after I ate their food I had the worst stomach ache. I usually don't get stomach aches... But the spicy salmon sushi was definitely the best. It's worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Oban Sushi does offers a decent and inexpensive Lunch Specials (till 4pm daily) from $4.99!

Sushi Bar Lunch Specials consists of mainly maki but at least they are all made to order and quite fresh!

I decided on S2 Sushi Roll ($7.99) which allows me to choose 3 rolls out of 12 choices with miso soup/salad/fountain pop . I ended up having Salmon, Spicy Salmon and California Roll.

The salad that came with my meal has way too much dressing and the miso soup was meh.

The rolls though were all quite delicious. At this price point, I am not complaining!

Of course, there are also AYCE options for both lunch and dinner. 

Service is friendly and courteous. 

Give Oban Sushi a try if you are in the neighbourhood, but avoid the prime lunch hour unless you want to be surrounded by teens...."}
