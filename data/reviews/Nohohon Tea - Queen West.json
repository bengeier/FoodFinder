{"text":"I went here for the first time this afternoon. I was able to have a conversation with the owner (a lovely Japanese women). She explained the concept behind her Cafe and I was nothing short of impressed! Most bubble tea stores use powders to make their drinks. The powders and not only unnatural, but laden with sugar. At Nohohon, all the ingredients are fresh! If you are lactose intolerant, they have almond milk and soy. I ordered a green tea, vanilla latte with almond milk and red bean (the red beans were in place of tapioca). It was delicious! The staff are very friendly as well, which made the experience even better. I will definitely be visiting Nohohon again! It's important to have healthier option of the foods we love and Nohohon had done that for Toronto with bubble tea."}
{"text":"This is definitely one unique experience for having tea. Coming back for more Yuzu drinks, and cookies."}
{"text":"My husband just picked up a bubble tea take out order and could not stop speaking about how lovely and kind the staff, especially the lady that was at the front. The taro bubble tea I ordered was extremely delicious and actually tasted healthy unlike the sugar loaded bubble teas you get everywhere else. Guilt free drink. Delicious, great customer service, highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I just have to say, the service here is absolutely amazing. The owner is SUPER friendly, and genuine. Her politeness and joy are pretty contagious.

The interior is brilliant and looks very authentic. From what I gathered, the owner is actually from Japan. The store also sells vegan onigiri and Japanese bottled soda.

I had to try the Tokyo Fog, so I got a large, and she informed me that the topping was free! The price came out to around $6, so it's pretty much the same as other bubble teas, if not a little more expensive, but the matcha is hand-whisked in store. The store smells soooo good when she mixes the matcha!

However, the tapioca in my drink wasn't as soft and chewy as I would have liked. It tasted a little bit undercooked, but the drink was pretty good. I think I may try something else that has more matcha in it next time. The matcha in the Tokyo Fog wasn't strong enough for me.

Other than that, I really like this place! Not to mention, there are a lot of opportunities to save money here! For the Vicinity points card, you only have to get 3 points to upsize your drink for free, and if you check in on Yelp, you get $1 off! SCORE. I even got a text after my first visit, saying I could claim a BOGO drink!

I saw a picture on the website where you got BOGO when you came in with Blue Jay's apparel during the World Series. That's so awesome how this place caters to its locals and supports Toronto's culture!

Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"\"Nohohon\" the Japanese tea room is such a simple and rustic place that combines both of traditional and modern Japan with the fusion of Ontario culture. On the busy street of Queen Street West, Nohohon, which has just opened a week already stand out among crowded. 

I happened to walk pass and noticed the grand opening sign. First thing that has interested me, the meaning of the store name \"Nohohon\" which means tranquil, a pleasant state of mind. The store has decorated in Japanese traditional style in the mahogany tone, the \"tsuki akari\" (modern crescent moon lamp) is very pretty and I love the minimal area of \"tatami\" (rice straw mat) and small round table that can fit in about 4 people. As well as the 2 long chairs that big enough for 2-4 people to sit per seat. The atmosphere is calm as its name. 

Then I noticed that the bubble tea here uses authentic ingredients and their own original fresh brewed tea. I decided to order \"Tokyo Fog\" ( Matcha green tea with vanilla ) which is the unique blend by Nohohon. I enjoyed the flavor immediately and I could taste Matcha flavor which is not too sweet as other bubble tea stores. Tapioca is also good quality. The price is fine and the customer service is great. Nohohon also has free WiFi available, which is convenient for anyone who wants to take moment to relax. I can't wait to visit there again to try other menu!"}
{"text":"Nohohon Tea Room = love, love, love! I frequent here for the matcha (I usually get the hot straight matcha with agave), and I know many who are obsessed with the boba. Although I'm generally not a huge boba fan, I enjoy Nohohon's take on it.  

The product is always high-quality and made with care. Every matcha drink is hand-whisked to order. They don't use artificial powders or refined sugar and offer dairy alternatives. There's an interesting selection of drinks and several variations on matcha, but yet the menu is not overwhelming and easy to follow. They've mastered the basics (straight matcha) and have also managed to create more unique yummy beverages (hello, Tokyo Fog!). 

I like that they give you the option to sweeten your matcha with organic agave syrup or pure sugar cane or leave it straight-up. Too many places assume their customers want sweetness a la Starbucks and I love that Nohohon is an exception to this. Sweetened drinks at Nohohon are never overdone and always just right. 

They have an amazing staff. If you're a newbie to matcha, I definitely recommend trying out Nohohon for your first matcha experience. From my experience, the staff will be helpful, patient and honest (they're always straight-up in warning that their sweetening is not as heavy-handed as most places). 

The location is great - just a few steps west from the 501 Queen streetcar Spadina stop. 

I took one star off only because the space is so dang tiny and it would be so much better if there were room to linger and hang out. There are only 4 tiny tables currently. The ambience they've got going right now is great --very calm and quiet -- but it is not ideal to be an earshot away from the counter no matter where you are in the space (aka it's hard to have a chat without feeling like your entire conversation is being heard by everyone else in the tea room). 

It's also worth noting they sell cute little matcha kits (a perfect gift for matcha-obsessed friends) and whisks if you're into DIY."}
{"text":"I love bubble Tea !  My favorite bubble tea is honeydew latte.  I also enjoy the honeydew bubble tea smoothie as well I am obsessed !! LOVE !!!"}
{"text":"Got the tokyo fog today. Large with one topping included was $5.25 + tax. I had tapioca in my drink. Overall, I enjoyed my drink. It was not overly sweet, just right.  There was a strong matcha taste with a hint of vanilla. Surprisingly, at the end, my cup didn't have any residue matcha powder which is common at other places that make matcha drinks...which means it was a drink made right! Great service! I do wish there was space for sit-in... I will definitely come back + uptown toronto needs a Nohohon!"}
{"text":"My favorite tea room before Tsujiri opened in Toronto, but I still frequent Nohohon for their Tokyo Fog and Furano Field matcha lattes.  Have them iced or hot!  Mind you, if you're thinking steaming hot as in Chinese tea, you may be disappointed to find your drink on the warm side.  And if you're wondering if they did the hot version wrong?  No absolutely not!  Green teas aren't meant to be steeped with boiling water anyways, as it will destroy the flavor and nutrients.  80C is the best water temp to use!  And I love Nohohon's hot matcha the way it is!  

You can't go wrong with Tokyo Fog which is their best seller!  It's in essence a matcha latte with a hint of vanilla.  I love Furano Field when I have a stressful day at work.  The lavender tasting matcha latte is both soothing and aromatic!

Their red bean topping partners perfectly with any matcha drink.  I like that Nohohon uses larger sized red beans with a nicer texture than what Taiwanese BBT chains like Chatime use.  Drinks aren't too sweet either.  I usually don't need to modify the sweetness level here while I do only 30% - 50% sugar at Chatime.

Attentive service and a tranquil setting are what you get here too!  It's my urban sanctuary!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, clean and interesting selection of flavours - good change of scene from your typical bubble tea joints!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, good drink for a cold day.

I've heard lots of things about here, one day I was in the area so I decided to give it a try.

She recommended me the taro milk, love how I can choose soy milk instead of regular milk."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is based solely on their taro smoothie with added red bean. I know this is suppose to be a Japanese tea room but who can resist fresh taro bubble tea? I ordered the smoothie through Ritual and it was ready for me when I got there. The taro smoothie itself is smooth and the perfect sweetness (i.e. \"not too sweet\" as we Asians like to say). The red beans were also sweetened (but not too sweet) and tasted fresh. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and I am honestly disappointed. It's a tiny little place located on Queen St. West. The service is friendly and the place itself was quite cozy, however I found the drinks to be lacking. There aren't that many seats, and I would imagine that it would get quite cramped when it does get busy. 

When ordering the drink, I was told that if I wanted the cold umeboshi drink I would have to get a large which I did. It was somewhat irritating that I wasn't given the option of getting the smaller size. I got the cold umeboshi drink, the drink tasted really bland. It tasted basically like umeboshi and water. And for the price that I was charged for it, I have to say I was really disappointed by it. My friend got the taro slushie with tapioca and I asked to try it. I found it grainy and overly sweet, I think there are places that does it better."}
{"text":"If I lived closer to this tea house, I'd likely become a daily spender. By far my favourite is the hot taro latte with soy milk. Its sweet, with chunks of real taro and is the perfect companion for a cold day. 

I've also had their Tokyo Fog (hot) and their Matcha Macchiato (cold). It's no lie that their matcha is top quality. Each of their drinks is on the sweeter side but don't let that comment take away from the bitterness that is matcha. Nohohon maintains the matcha flavour profile while adding their touch of hazelnut (Tokyo fog) and caramel (matcha macchiato) to differentiate each drink. 

If I'm even remotely close to the area I make an effort to swing by. It's worth the average of $5 per drink lol. However beware that if you are coming with a large group there is only enough seating capacity in this tea house for 6!

Will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Nohohon is a cozy little tea shop on Queen Street with a pretty decent selection in their menu of about 15 or so items. Their menu features many of the staples of bubble tea shops like Taro, Oolong, etc. but also provides a good variety in Green tea/matcha drinks and some unique items like Ume. I tried the Momo Oolong and Tokyo Fog during my visit. 
The Momo Oolong is good if you don't want something too sweet and if you really like Oolong tea, I thought the flavour was pretty interesting compared to other oolong bubble teas but just be warned that it does not come with milk. The Tokyo Fog was absolutely fantastic, I would definitely recommend trying it if you like vanilla and green tea - it's also very Instagram friendly! Another bonus is that they include one free topping, and the prices are generally cheaper or on par with larger chain bubble tea shops. All in all, definitely a nice little tea shop and a great change of pace from busier shops like Cha time with super friendly staff, come with a smaller group and you'll have a fabulous time."}
{"text":"Where do I start. This is definitely not your generic Chai Time or TeaShop168. I got the Matcha Latte with grass jelly and it excited me to see a lady behind the counter actually whisking my matcha before completing my drink. 

Pros: 
-Good balance of matcha, milk and sweetness.
-The grass jelly is not super soft (I like it a little more firm) 
-The taste of matcha is so distinct and not too bitter and is elevated by a hint of sweetness. 
-The milk ties it all together to give it a creamy feel. 
-Nothing takes away from one another.
-Staff is super nice 
-Decor is so pretty and well put
-There is variety but not its not overwhelming (like some tea shops that have rows and rows of drinks) 

Cons:
-cannot accommodate a big sit-down group
-there is only one in Toronto"}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed Nohohon Tea! The service was amazing and was personal. Not having had Nohohon Tea before, I asked for some recommendations and I got the Green Haze. The matcha was of good quality, but I didn't taste too much of the hazelnut (I don't mind, I mainly wanted matcha with just a HINT of other flavouring). I loved that a topping was free and got red bean. This red bean was not soaked in sugar so don't expect it to be super sweet! 

TL;DR if you're looking for a drink with no BS fake powders & not sickly sugary with the addition of dairy-free alternatives (hey vegans!)... Nohohon Tea should be on your try list."}
{"text":"The hot taro latte are to die for! Skip the furano field though.

To be honest, I regretted after I got the taro latte. I regretted not getting it in large!!! It smelled heavenly! It actually tasted like those Chinese taro dessert as a drink, creamy and aromatic. The taro paste melts in your mouth and it wasn't too sweet. Having taro in a hot drink is such a great idea, it was very comforting in some way, like mana's hug lol. 

I also tried the furano field despite all the disappointed reviews, and I was not impressed. They were right, it tasted extremely watered down. I could taste a hint of the lavender, the matcha taste and milk were very faint. I assume lavender tea was added to the matcha latte which resulted the watered down drink. I understand that nohohon uses natural ingredients, but there gotta be a way to make this drink taste like lavender without watering it down, some room of improvements I guess. (If you like lavender, I highly recommend the lavender latte from Bicerin)

What I loved the most besides the taro latte was service. All the staff were showing great hospitality, they were very patient on explaining the drinks to each guests since the names and descriptions were a little vague. Whenever is possible they would open the door for their guests when they were leaving, which I think was too much lol. The drinks were on the pricier side but well worth the money(don't forget about the check in offer for $1off!!)"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday after work and this bubble tea place was empty. Not even a single customer inside. It's dark and tiny inside. The bubble tea was watery and very disappointing. The matcha tasted bitter and very bland. It's $7 for a regular sized bubble tea with toppings. Was definitely not worth the hype. Probably wouldn't come back again.

I guess that's why this place was completely empty when I went in."}
{"text":"Did not like their boba tea.  It was actual taro root but not sure if i was digging their tea leaves. Hmmmm."}
{"text":"After hearing the hype about this place, I wanted to try it out and see if it lives up to its glory. It's a small and quaint store in Queen West with a very small menu. I ordered the fresh taro smoothie with tapioca which ended up being close to $7 after taxes. It is definitely on the high end for these specially drink places. The drink itself was very good as it was not too sweet like many other shops and composed of all natural ingredients. All in all, definitely one of the better places in Toronto if you are willing to pay the steeper prices."}
{"text":"I Had the Tokyo Fog, which was like a green tea flavoured milk tea, which I had with red bean as my topping. Tasted pretty good, and unique (at least I havent tried anything like it before). The service was also really good, the person was really friendly and good with suggestions."}
{"text":"Nohohon is definitely under-rated! I would say that Nohohon is better than many of the other bubbletea and drink places in the downtown area. The matcha drinks are very good and going into this restaurant reminds me of going into a restaurant in Japan (in other words, it is very small but clean and cozy). I also found that the customer service was very good. Drinks were never just passed or left on the counter. The server would actually walk out from behind the bar and hand you the drink with both hands. My favourite drink so far is the Lavender Matcha which was a very frothy matcha-lavender drink."}
{"text":"Great high-end Japanese boba; I didn't even realize that was a thing. I had a green tea boba, and asked for 30% sweet; that worked out nicely.  The owner warned some people find the green bitter, but it suited me well. 

Music is pleasant and unobtrusive. There weren't any tables yet (they're working on it), but there was a cushioned bench, with bamboo pads to put drinks on. 

Tasty."}
{"text":"With the display in the window, I was expecting traditional Japanese teas, maybe with some soft Zen music in the background. To my surprise, I was faced with a bubble tea menu when I walked in, instead.

There's only a few options on offer, a couple classic milk teas, some cold matcha drinks, and a few flavoured green teas. With such a small menu, it's easy to make your pick. The drinks stay true to original tea flavour, but I have to say they're a little pricey for the size. With boutique bubble tea shops popping up all over the place, you would think there would be some competition on the price.

If money is no object, 'Nohohon tea room' is great choice for bubble tea on Queen West."}
{"text":"The drinks were really plain. Was really looking forward to trying out the cold drinks but it was a let down since the matcha didn't seem to be blended with the milk in the bubble tea it tasted really powdery... Go try the matcha drinks from other Japanese matcha cafes around Toronto instead. The staffs were really friendly but the interior was so crammed."}
{"text":"Way over priced (considering how small the cup is) and pretty mediocre. The decor is alright."}
{"text":"Small Bubble tea shop which have 2 workers in the cramped space.  They make everything fresh here so the wait will take longer. But it is def worth it.  All Bubble tea comes with either soy milk or almond milk which is a plus. And you get a free topping like red bean.  My Matcha drink was okay as I expected better but I will be back to try other ones such as the Taro one."}
{"text":"They used to have a good lavender flavoured bubble tea. Gooooood shi. Doesn't look as dirty/dull as other BBT place. Please reopen faster."}
{"text":"This was the best best taro drink I have ever had.  A little on the hot side, but it was amazing.  I had the Fresh Taro Latte and my wife had the Tokyo Fog with bubbles.  Hands down best bubble tea place in Toronto.

The atmosphere is great the service was extremely friendly.

My wife and I will definitely be back often!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is quite relaxing since the people who operate the place all seemed to be really close friend.  The place is a little small though as there are only four tables that will sit around only 15 people.  The only thing I didn't like was the portable air conditioner which was in the way of the entrance.  It was a little hot too.  The service was really good as the barista was talking to me like talking to a friend.  I ordered the large milk latte for $5.50 plus tax with free red bean topping.  It was really yummy.  I just wish the AC is little bit more cool.  I would come back here if I am around the area."}
{"text":"Not usually a huge fan of matcha, but found Tokyo Fog with Grass Jelly just right amount of matcha & sweetness. Oolong with lychee jelly was good but nothing extraordinary.

As mentioned by others, place is really just a takeout spot."}
{"text":"Nohohon:  A pleasant state of mind.  Calm.  Tranquil.  

Streamlined menu.  Freshly brewed tea.  Real ingredients for full flavoured beverages.  No powder or artificial tastes here. 

Minimalistic, traditional, Japanese decor.
There's even a display of tea cups made by local artists.  

The owner, Nanako, is lovely.  She clearly has a passion for what she does.  

The current menu has summer drinks, but in the winter, the menu will change accordingly.

This is a great place for a pick-me-up while shopping on Queen West!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

Gave an extra 0.5 for their great service. This place serves up all natural matcha and milk teas as well as lattes. They also use natural sugar cane and organic agave as their sweetener. Tried a few drinks and they were pretty decent. I would prefer the latte to be a bit thicker and more frothy as it was a bit thin for me but the taste is just right.

It's a very cozy little 'tea room' and by that I mean there's just a few small tables approx 20\"x20\" so it's more of a grab and go kind of place."}
{"text":"This is a cute, little Japanese tea shop that has a casual and warm atmosphere - service was great and servers were very friendly. I ordered the matcha green tea with tapioca which had a pleasant though slightly watery matcha flavour - I liked that it was also not too sweet. A nice change from your typically super sweet creamy bubble teas.

Tip - check in to get $1 off your drink!"}
{"text":"I ordered a hot matcha latte, it was freshly whisked and prepared with heart. But it tasted watery for some reason. I liked how it was lightly sweetened by agave though, and the lady was very friendly. I may give it another try."}
{"text":"I headed over there during December to get an onigiri (I was so pumped to find somewhere that sold it that was closer to where I live/work than Sanko), but was told that their onigiri makers were on vacation. Fair. 

I stopped by yesterday around noon to pick one up, and was told that the onigiri was being delivered within the half hour, which put a damper my lunch plans. I ran some errands and went grocery shopping which took me to 1:30pm, and stopped by again on the way home. Still no onigiri.... more like NOnigiri. 

Don't get me wrong, I like tea, but the real draw for me for this place hasn't been delivered - literally."}
{"text":"There's nothing quite like a hand whisked matcha latte and there aren't many places in Toronto that make a really good one. That being said, I had an amazingly delicious one at Nohohon tonight. The owner made it herself, was very friendly and passionate about her yummy creations.

There were many other options to choose from on the menu, for those who like to mix up their flavours, the macchiatto for those who love their caramel, (owner recommended) Furano Field which has a touch of lavender and also a seasonal pumpkin spice matcha.

I noticed they had soy and almond milk, great alternative for those who can't drink regular milk and aguave as a sweetener (as well as pure sugar cane) and a few topping options, in addition to tapioca ie lychee, red bean

The store had a nice traditional feel to it, from various teas / cups on display, cranes and beautiful bonsai tree, to the Japanese snacks such as Wasabi peas.

Great location (Spadina / Queen St), you can take your yummy drink and stroll along Queen St!

I'll be going back here soon and I asked if my matcha is available hot, apparently all the drinks can be had hot or cold!"}
{"text":"LETS GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY , APPRECIATE THAT THIS PLACE HAS A SMALLER MENU SO THAT YOU DON'T FEEL INTIMIDATED ON WHAT TO ORDER, YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR DRINKS HERE TOO ^_^  honestly just go try this boba place it's japanese and not taiwanese and chinese styles it's Matcha tea actually does taste pretty earth and doesn't have a powdery after taste :D

honestly the owner knows how to run a business you can she and her staff love what there doing and it's so nice to be served by such warm friendly people. 

one word to describe this places atmosphere is just zen, I remember going here and it's nice and quite elegant charm was the best thing ever, if this place opened in the morning I would reward my self everyday after my jogs :D

Nana, Ryan, Laurel and Asuka keep doing your things you guys have alot of passion keeping your business awesome and you guys will only rise in the ladder of success :D  I love you guys I can't wait to try everything on your menu :)"}
{"text":"Cute tea shop! Had the Furano Field (lavender) matcha drink hot on a chilly night and it was the perfect thing to sip while continuing our journey down Queen Street. The lychee jelly was plentiful and yummy,  but overpowered any lavender flavour. Next time I'll try it without!"}
{"text":"Spectacular service combined with incredible natural flavors for unforgettable bubble tea! Chat with the inspiring woman behind the counter to learn her story of how and why she started Nohohon!"}
{"text":"Their official name is Nohohon Tea Room and...it's literally the size of a room.
The interior is nicely decorated and gives you the whole japanese tea house feel. They also share a washroom with the ajisai AYCE next door, so you're getting the luxury service there. 

There's a tatami mat up front where you can sit if that is your preference. Otherwise, there are wooden chairs available if you would rather not feel like an emperor.

It's a japanese themed tea house so you have options like matcha milk tea, houjicha milk tea, yuzu lemonade, taro smoothies, or momo oolong. They also provide hot pots of teas if you're feeling less sugary.

Bubble Teas come in small, medium, or large cups, with soy or almond milk, as well as one free topping (tapioca, lychee jelly, grass jelly, or red bean). You can also customize the sugar or ice levels, but you'll have to take some initiative there. I didn't think about it and ended up with ice in my drink. The price is about the same as other tea places, if you include that one free topping.

Vicinity is accepted if you use that rewards program (you might as well, since most tea places offer it).

There is usually only one or two people working behind the counter so if there are others in line already prepare to wait a few minutes.

I ordered the green haze with almond milk and tapioca, which is a matcha latte with hints of hazelnut flavour. The drink was enjoyable, though I found there is not as much matcha flavour but maybe the milk and sugar diluted it. The tapioca was great though: large and chewy, unlike a lot of other BBT places.

It's a nice place to sit down after a meal nearby. Well, if you can find a place to sit."}
{"text":"Hurrah! This is one of the only bubbletea places that I've been to that offers soy milk as a substitute for the lactose-intolerant fellas! :) 
I ordered the Green Haze and it was quite good. Not too sweet (which is always a concern at bbt stores) and the tapioca was a nice chewy texture. My only suggestion would be that their matcha flavour was a bit more mild than other places. You could definitely tell that they used real matcha but I would've preferred it to be stronger. 
Also, this place has great service. We came in a few minutes past closing and the girl working there still served us - and she had a great attitude too! She was friendly and patient, and she took the time to explain all of the recommended drinks to us. 

I will definitely come back the next time I'm in the area! :)"}
{"text":"A new bubble tea store that features non powdered drinks and many different options to choose from. The service here is actually incredible and the best I've ever encountered such that the bubble tea barista was so kind. I love how you get the option of substituting soy milk, and if you aren't allergic to soy, you should definitely try it. I recommend the fresh taro slush! This place is on the expensive side but the quality makes up for it. Will return!"}
{"text":"Yay for vegan options! This place isn't really meant for sit down, but rather a place for take away affordable yummy drinks! I had the matcha on the rocks, not too sweet at all but super yummy. My boyrfriend had the PB latte which he loves! Something different from the typical pumpkin spice you can get anywhere. Service is fast and sweet. They also serve vegan cookies and vegan onigri."}
{"text":"lovely place! I ordered taro latte, the taro was made fresh and smell very nice but it's way toooooo sweet for me. I will try matcha next time."}
{"text":"Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing or perhaps I've really just had better matcha. This tea room is a small hole in the wall store along queen street that boasts hand crafted drinks and real authentic matcha in its bubble teas. I was skeptical so I didn't get anything but my friend was extremely excited to try the \"matcha on the rocks\" drink which was essentially matcha tea and coconut water poured over ice. You get one free topping so he chose the grass jelly. The combination was peculiar (matcha and coconut???) and tasted even worse than I had imagined. Though I could definitely tell the matcha was fresh and authentic, this drink was terrible and I'm definitely going to have to try something else if I ever come back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Excellent selection of teas that are rich with flavour, but do not taste artificial. Since I am lactose intolerant, I love the soy and almond milk options that I have yet to see at any other bubble tea stores. The tapioca is always fresh and soft, creating the perfect combination of taste and texture.

My recommendation would be the taro smoothie with tapioca ( made with almond milk) or the hazelnut matcha bubbletea !"}
{"text":"Very nice matcha! I ordered a hot matcha straight, I liked it with nice matcha aroma! The place is very small but very neat and tidy, it's a nice visit for doing a quick grab and go hot matcha in my opinion!"}
{"text":"A cute little tea shop tucked near the corner of Queen and Spadina. I heard lots about their specialty in matcha flavoured drinks and as a huge fan of matcha I just had to try! 

Ordered the large iced Tokyo Fog with grass jelly using the $1 off Yelp coupon. Before the coupon its $5.50 + tax. The matcha flavour is distinct and not too sweet. The grass jelly was in blobs which is what I prefer but it wasnt as soft as chatime's. 

The lady at the cash was very friendly! Overall, this place is great, authentic and definitely worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Must try Hot taro late.. Haven't had one that uses real taro and it makes a huge difference."}
{"text":"Walked by on opening day. It's a small tea shop, a grab and go, but it's very modern and looks great. They've got very friendly staff who are still trying to get their flow right now so service is a bit slow. My friend got a Tokyo Fog which was delicious and I got the Nohohon Tea (milk tea) which was wasn't bad. Of the two if I had to pick the Toyko Fog was the better drink.  

Nice little place for a grab and go Bubbletea."}
{"text":"This Japanese tea room on Queen West is one of my go-to places downtown. Combined with their list of delicious drinks, the staff and service is always amazing! They honestly have the nicest staff here. :) 

My favourite is the Hot Fresh Matcha latte - just the right amount of sweetness and has a rich matcha flavour. The cold version of this is just as delicious! Their taro smoothie is also made with real taro - no artificial powders."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try out Nohohon because of the interesting drink menu, but I was disappointed with my drink. I had the Lavender milk tea with pearls--it was watered down, it was a greenish brown colour, and didn't taste like milk tea. I should have expected this, as their drinks are made with either almond or soy milk, rather than the traditional dairy milk or milk powder. The pearls were decent, but far from spectacular. 

In summary, courteous staff, but disappointing drinks. Perhaps, their other drinks are tastier, but I'm not keen to try them after my first experience."}
{"text":"The only thing sweeter than the tapioca are the ladies who work there! I am giving this place 5 stars even though I didn't personally enjoy my drink, because the service was impeccable. Example: the kind lady working there rushed around the counter to open the door for us, even though we both had free hands. You can't make this stuff up.

If you're looking for a drink recommendation: the taro smoothie with almond milk. Yum. 

If you're looking for an unsweetened, more strange-on the-tongue textured beverage: the decaf plum sencha. To each their own!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tokyo Fog - love the strong natural matcha taste, wasn't too sweet and was very smooth. Tapioca was a little on the chewier side, but I like it chewy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For people who don't know, Nohohon tea room has recently closed down and is planning on moving to Dundas/Bathrust

Quoted from their website:

\"Queen West location is closed on April 30th 2017.

We are moving to Dundas / Bathrust

Opening Date will be to be announced.\""}
{"text":"Service was great and all, but I wasn't really feeling Nohohon. Despite being very excited for it when I planned my trip, it didn't match my expectations. I got the Green Haze (which is basically green tea with some hazelnut flavors; ~4 CAD for a small). I only thought it was decent. I thought that the tea was just too much. Yeah, yeah I know this is a tea room, what do I expect? But it was a little overwhelming for me. The boba pearls were good though, nice and soft but no rock hard center...just as it should be! The girlfriend got the Tokyo Fog, and she also thought it was just decent, but didn't really give details. 

TIP: Be sure to shake well! The powder will all dissolve if you shake it enough. 
TIP 2: Don't forget to check in on the Yelp app for 1 CAD off your order!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Excellent service and really friendly staff 
Matcha latte

Cons:
Hojicha, it tasted like water :( 


Overall I really like this place, although their matcha latte isn't as creamy as coffee shops I really like how I can get red bean and tapioca with it. I esp like mine with soy. I've only tried the regular matcha one and I like it, just stay away from the hojicha unless you like your drinks bland. My friends liked their matcha lattes as well. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Update:
The owner of the business messaged me and because they actually addressed some of my concerns, I decided to upgrade my review. 

I was quite disappointed with the tea from here. I got the Green Haze, which is matcha and hazelnut syrup. Although the matcha tasted good, the tapioca were overcooked and the hazelnut syrup was a bit overwhelming. Considering a small cup cost almost $6 (I also got soy milk which cost an extra 60 cents) I would rather get bubble tea from elsewhere. Maybe I just had a bad experience or should've tried another flavour, but from this one time I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone. 

Also, they don't take Amex here unfortunately, which was quite inconvenient."}
{"text":"To call Nohohon a bubble tea shop is a bit inaccurate. A bubble tea shop is like a 20 year old at the club: powdered, pretty, with too many options and often, not enough substance. Nohohon is the more refined older sister, who knows what she's got but doesn't flaunt it with accessories and add-ons. She just beckons you with a genuine smile and quiet disposition. 

Nohohon is a small shop but you can't help but feel a bit more tranquil stepping inside. The people that work there are soft-spoken and polite to the extreme, which is very refreshing compared to places that treat you like a walking wallet. The menu isn't loaded but you know immediately what their specialty is: authentic Japanese green tea. And when I say authentic, I mean it. You can see them mixing up the Matcha with a traditional wooden brush and stone bowl. I've tried two drinks so far:  

Matcha Macchiato: A light milky tea drink with hints of caramel. It was definitely different from the heavier black milk teas, but was so refreshing! Like any Macchiato, the tea and the milk were separated very beautifully and mixed together after a couple (many) quick photos. One thing I noticed though was that the Matcha was not very strong, but I think it has to do with the drink being iced and half of the cup being milk. 

Taro Smoothie: You know how normal taro bubble teas look like someone dropped a bright purple bath bomb in a cup? Nohohon isn't about that. This taro smoothie is a very neutral colour, given that it's made with actual fresh taro pieces. I might have to go back to ordering taro drinks now, but only if they're like this. 

It really seems that Nohohon is a tea shop first, bubble tea shop second. Even though this place is out of the way, I'm really looking forward to trying more of their hot drinks and homebrew teas. Yes, you got me. With your peaceful demeanor, lovely attitude, and authenticity, I have to say, I've been thoroughly seduced.

(80/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Where do you get a warm drink on a snowy day?  Nohohon Tea Room is my go to place.  I got Hot Lavender brew tea with tapioca.  I chose it with almond milk.  It's absolutely delicious.  The flavour was perfect.  Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere.  I will be back soon to try other tea."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check out Nohohon. As another review mentioned, it's a tiny shop with one bench so it's basically a take out only joint. There's no food and it's tea drinks only. I like the location; right at Queen and Spadina, you can check out a number of shops pre or post Nohohon. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by two friendly employees. The menu was a little vague so I had to ask for clarification with regards to what was in each of their drinks. Nohohon doesn't really have anything unique about it- I'm not sure if their 'Japaneseness' is enough to get patrons to come in. Talking to the employees, the owner's vision is to have  a shop that sells healthier bubble tea ... All the drinks don't seem to be healthy as they all have sugar, honey and cream. Anyway, if I want tea, Nohohon won't come to mind right away."}
{"text":"Located slightly west of Spadina on Queen St. W, Nohohon is conveniently located near, but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Queen West. Nohohon is a small, but very cute tea shop specializing in Japanese matcha; they also offer onigiri and uniquely flavoured oatmeal cookies (e.g. yuzu chocolate, miso). There is very limited seating. 

I had the Tokyo fog, hot. Of course, I made sure to check-in on Yelp ($1 off any drink). Although it wasn't as creamy as I had expected, it was subtly sweet and had a beautiful vanilla aroma. In general, Nohohon teas won't be as sweet as other chain boba shops; they use organic agave and pure cane sugar - according to their instagram, an 80% sweet level at other bubble tea shops is equivalent to Nohohon's extra sweet. 

To top off their delicious drinks, the girls that work here are super sweet; if you have any questions about their matchas, they will happily answer you. They'll also explain to you how they freshly grind their matcha to order. However, the true display of Japanese hospitality is how they'll open the door for every customer once they get up to go - I loved that!"}
{"text":"Fantastic match a latte with tapioca pearls.  They also have sweet concoctions like caramel and hot chocolate.  I love the polite Japanese style service.  Especially when they hold out the straws."}
{"text":"I love Nohohon! The staff are very friendly and happy to answer any of your questions. They have a delicious selection of teas and jellies and can make anything dairy-free for you. The spiced hot chocolate is really nice too, and the matcha quality is excellent even for lattes and specialty teas."}
{"text":"This place had amazing drinks. I had the green haze with lychee jelly both as a warm drink and as a hot drink, and they were amazing both times, though I preferred the cold drink by just the tiniest bit more. I also had a cold taro bubble tea which was really good. I am impressed that they make their taro paste from fresh taro. We were warned by the barista that the taro drink was very sweet, but I was surprisingly not too bothered by the sweetness. I think it would have been very good warm as well.

For those travelling from another country, this shop takes Visa cards."}
{"text":"I love the quality of the drinks they offer here, I know the owner puts in a lot of effort in choosing good quality ingredients. I love that the menu offers healthy choices and not your typical commercialized drinks. Tried their matcha on the rocks and also enjoyed their taro drink as well. Very different from your usual bubble tea shops, can't wait to be back and try more drinks!"}
{"text":"Matcha is delicate and delicious.  So many places burn their matcha water that is too hot, but here at Nohohon Tea, they make the matcha on the proper way so that the tea can e savored for all of it's complex and sweet flavours.  Perfect texture boba."}
{"text":"I needed a warm drink on this particularly blustery November day so walked to nearby Nohohon as I'd been eyeing this place for a while on Yelp. It's a tiny shop, literally seats 8 people max. But they serve delicious matcha lattes,  and other Japanese inspired beverages like sencha, yuzu, and umeboshi (plum). I ordered the Tokyo Fog (matcha latte with vanilla) and requested soy milk. The drink came with a choice of free topping including tapioca, lychee jelly, grass jelly, or red bean. I got the grass jelly. I liked that the drink was strong in matcha flavour and not too sweet. The grass jelly added a slight bitterness to the drink which I actually enjoyed, and provided a textural contrast.

Despite the availability of toppings, I wouldn't call this a bubble tea shop. It is definitely more of a tea room that happens to serve toppings with their beverages. 

If you enjoy matcha or other Japanese inspired drinks and snacks, you should try Nohohon."}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese Matcha shop with very warm employee(s). Unlike most of the bubble tea places, they use real milk instead of milk powder and add I believe agave syrup? They also use real traditional matcha powder.

I ordered an iced Matcha latte with 1/4 sugar and red bean. The red bean is sweetened (if you add red bean, it might be a good ideal to ask for less sugar). Don't forget to check in on yelp for an extra $1 off and they have vicinity rewards (I got a BOGO upon my first visit) so make sure to get your vicinity points if you have the reward program!"}
{"text":"Amazing lattes! Love the matcha drinks here, and the Yuzu Hot Chocolate is my favourite: Subtle, smooth and not overly-sweet in the best possible way.

The shop is very small, but that helps it feel cozy and like the hidden gem it definitely is!"}
{"text":"The owner here is so sweet! The matcha tea is obviously extremely high quality. I also really appreciate that they're on ritual."}
{"text":"Nohohon Tea room is a newly opened tea shop on Queen Street West!  I decided to come here on a Friday night after work to visit this place and to catch up with Nana!  

As I walked in, the staff were super friendly and greeted me with a big smile and recommended some drinks for my friend and I to try.  We decided to play it safe and went with the Matcha Latte (needed a caffeine boost after a LONG work week) and the Latte did not disappoint.  Very strong matcha flavour and was balanced well with the Latte flavour.  I want to point out Nohohon is not your typical bubble tea place, they do not use powders for their drinks flavouring and instead tea are brewed fresh from ingredients from Japan!  Decoration is very impressive, detailed and gives a good traditional Japanese vibe!  Nana also hand picked a beautiful tatami (aka mat) close to the window for customers to sit and relax.  I had a really great time enjoying a great latte while catching up with a friend!  I will be back for sure and visit more often and try other drinks and new items (I heard the Yuzu lemonade is very good)!"}
{"text":"okay drinks here. I only went here because Dannie Riel was here and liked their stuff. so i tried it out for that reason. i have ordered the Tokyo Fog two times now and idk...not a huge fan. 

the first time i got it, i didn't shake it too well so i ended drinking up all the sweetness and therefore was left with a drink that tasted like nothing 

the second time, i mixed it better and idk still not a huge fan. i felt like it wasn't sweet enough - no actually - it just lacked taste and flavour so yeah probably won't rly come here again unless my friends wanna come. their drinks aren't necessarily cheap (like with almost every other bubble tea or tea drinks store) so i would choose other stores over them . also, i feel like their store is REALLY STUFFY AND HOT. i always end up sweating even in the winter so yeah

**their servers are rly nice. occasionally the owner is there and she's very sweet"}
{"text":"I come to this place frequently as it has become a cult at my work (which is very close to the tea room!)

My favourite is the Matcha Macchiato with tapioca. It is quite thirst quenching and not as sweet as it sounds in a good way! The teas are brewed. I believe there are a few options for the toppings, like red bean (which was also good). I have also tried the Original Brew and Vanilla Brew. I wasn't a big fan of the Original Brew as I found it a little bit diluted.

The space inside the tearoom is a little compact although the interior ornaments are very cute and gives off a zen atmosphere. The staff are very nice and friendly. They serve the drinks personally and even hold the doors for you as you walk out."}
{"text":"I was here 6 months ago, and the experience was so exceptional that I can still remember now. First, I was lucky to have the owner serve me. She introduced me to the drink and shared her vision of infusing healthy ingredients to bubble tea. Speaking of healthy, the matcha they use is legit! Also, it blends well with the sweetness, totally does not give you the \"now i got to work it out\" feeling. Come here if you like bubble tea, not only that, enjoy the innovative and healthy Japanese tea.

- I ordered Tokyo fog by the way"}
{"text":"As a lover of Matcha ...and the fact that I live just minutes away....I went back to try my beloved hot Matcha latte this time again.   This time with the $1.25 upgrade to Kyoto Uji Matcha , and with no sugar except the sweetness in the matcha red bean.....and the result was a spectacular matcha latte, the best I've tasted in the city.   No tricks, or gimmicks, just a really fresh tasting cup.  

I was chatting with the owner and she said that earlier this year they've changed their suppliers for Matcha as well as adjusted the milk ratio, as well as changed their suppliers for almond and soy milk.    

Having the ability to upgrade to ceremonial grade Matcha is a game changer for me!  It also shows how Nohonhon really listens to their customers as well as works constantly to improve it's Matcha craft and ingredients.   

This year, Toronto's new fad seems to be Matcha cafe's ....everywhere...with a new cafe popping up every other week.    But a fad is a fad....and I must give credit where it's due to Nohonhon for being the first in Toronto....and having the experience and taking the time to tweak and make their core products right.   

Cheers to the best calm and enjoyable start to thanksgiving weekend ."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with the drinks I ordered here. Usually, I love anything that is flavoured with matcha, but the Tokyo Fog really didn't impress me. Firstly, my drink wasn't filled to the top of my cup. Something like that usually doesn't bother me, but there was a significant amount missing (you can see from the pictures). I also couldn't taste any vanilla flavour as the menu described. :( I know the aim of this store is to be healthier so they probably use less sugar, but my drink basically tasted like matcha and water mixed together (and not well I might add because I could still taste a lot of powder). The tapioca texture was nice though!
My friend ordered the Matcha Macchiato and she didn't enjoy her drink either. Although I have a feeling my drink might've been made wrong as it tastes completed different than how it is described on their Instagram post. And also because other reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it. I'm willing to give this place another try as they are still new and staff probably needs more practice making consistent drinks. The staff at cash was really friendly though! :)"}
{"text":"My favourite tea shop by far - the service is awesome - always so friendly, and being so patient with me as I ask at least 5 questions every time I'm in there. I always use the YELP promo - $1 off drink, so it's definitely a plus.

I've only gotten the TARO, but it's totally worth it for me. They told me that each drink has about 1/4 cup real taro and that's hard to come by especially in a world of powders and sugar highs. The taro is already soaked in honey, so I will never add extra sweetener and the texture is smooth, yet real tasting. A major bonus about what I love this place so much is that they have ALMOND MILK. 'Nuff said :)

I've been told the fogs and matcha are delicious so I need to try it out if I can get away from my taro love.

They also have other bites that I want to check out, but this place continues to win my heart over every time.

Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"Lovely little tea shop! I had the classic taro boba smoothie, which had real taro in it! This place isn't a typical bubble tea spot, since the drinks are not made from flavored powders and scoops of sugar. The green tea is strong and tasty! Also the tapioca bubbles were the perfect consistency, not too hard and not too squishy either. Next time I visit Toronto I'm definitely coming back to try the other teas!"}
{"text":"They suggested tokyo fog and it was exactly what i needed. Caffeine with some sweet

Small place but comfortable. Very helpfull staff. 

Service was very quick"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try here for a while.  We got some drink with hazelnut mist.  

How did it taste?  Not a fan of it per say.  It came with free tapioca but by the time we got to it at the end (it was a hot drink) it didn't go.

But they sell a matcha bun there and it is so light and fluffy.  My mouth is drooling just thinking about it.

Service is good!  They open the door for you when you leave (awesome!)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars upon first try!

Excellent service. The staff was friendly and informative. We bought one drink, but got another one free, on the spot, when we took a picture of our drink and put it on Instagram with the hash tag #nohohon This was a nice touch! I love free!

I got the large honey oolong tea with 30% sugar and less ice. They accommodate the sugar and ice despite not having it on the menu, which is pretty cool. With the drink, you get a choice of tapioca, lychee jelly, grass jelly, or red bean included in the price. I got grass jelly. The drink came up to $5.37 (including tax). You can pay with credit card. The tea itself was pretty refreshing. Very authentic. However, the grass jelly wasnt very good. It didn't have much flavouring and was not as soft as chatimes. A possible place to improve.

The free drink we got was the matcha macchiato with tapioca. It was cool looking with different coloured layers, but we couldn't really taste the matcha till later because the caramel overpowered the matcha. It got better once we stirred it more, but overall, I would put more matcha than caramel. I dont like my drink too sweet. *What I do want to rave about is the tapioca. One of the best I've had. Very flavourful and soft! Melted in my mouth.  Soooo good!*

I would definitely come back for another drink, the menu isn't extensive, which I like, and there's a whole bunch of stuff that ive never seen before like sencha mojito and yuzu lemonade. 

Definitely worth it if you use Instagram! You buy one drink and get the next one free if you Instagram a pic of the drink you bought. You get a free drink on the same day or a coupon to redeem on another day."}
{"text":"Great decor in this place. I got the Hazelnut flavored tea and it was the best bubble tea category drink I had when I was in toronto.

5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Food
I ordered an original brew hojicha milk tea. In case you were wondering, it for sure has a Japanese taste rather than a Chinese milk tea. It's nice change from what you know! They brew the tea fresh on the spot for you too. 

Service
Severely understaffed, as only one person was making drinks, and doing cash register. She was so ridiculously polite, greeting everyone, and even ran to open doors for guests. 

Atmosphere 
The place really feels like a tea room. it is decorated all in Japanese culture, and a nice escape from Queen Street!"}
{"text":"Great service and great tea. I only had the hot tea. Next time I want to try the bubble tea when I visit Toronto again. Cute little tea shop."}
{"text":"Great tea place. The cashier was extremely nice and showed us all the great local eateries. The matcha taste was excellent."}
{"text":"Cool bubble tea shop, love the environment. Nice location as well, right at the Queen/Spadina prime location, near lots of nice restaurants.

I ordered the Tokyo Fog and it did not disappoint. The ingredients were fresh and were good quality. I liked that they offer free toppings. I got the tapioca and they were nice and chewy, with a hint of sweetness. The bubble tea was on the pricier end for $5.35 for large size, but hey there's a Yelp coupon that gives you a dollar off any size drink. For the quality ingredients that the store is offering I think the pricing is fair, would pay $6 (including tax) to support a local quality tea shop than somewhere like Starbucks.

The owner was actually running the store when I came around noon today and she was really friendly. The store wasn't busy that time and my friend and I had a nice chat with her. The owner was attentive and asked for our suggestions on how to improve the tea shop. I told her it would be nice to show on the menu telling the customers that they can order different levels of sugar and ice. 

Another good thing about Nohohon is that they take Vicinity points card and offer different perks for the points
3 points - free upsize
6 points - free add on
10 points - free drink or snack

Can't wait to come back another time"}
{"text":"My Orders: lavender milk tea w/ red bean and tapioca, chilli kelp onigiri 

Plus
+ Food: I loved the onigiri! It was so delicious. I was a little skeptical because I love meat onigiris (and they only sell vegan onigiris) but it was rather flavorful. 
+ Service: the service was friendly and sweet. Even though my bbt wasnt filled to the brim (slight slither of air), the server pointed it out and apologized for it. I appreciated that. 

Minus 
- Space: I was lucky that I just wanted it to go. You might be able to squeeze a group of 2 of 3 here. They only have two tables."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come here and enjoy a bbt while we wait for a friend to get off work. It's our first time here so it took a few minutes to decide what we wanted and the staff were extremely friendly in answering all our questions we had! We finally decided to order an originalbrew with tapioca and red bean and the momo oolong with grass jelly. 

When our drinks were made the staff brought them over along with our straws! Love their customer service! 

The originalbrew was an interesting mix of green and black tea! We both enjoyed it along with the red bean and tapioca. It wasn't overly sweet like most bbt joints.

My momo oolong with grass jelly was great. If you don't like sugary drinks this one would be great. I didn't taste any sugar so I was able to enjoy the oolong tea. The grass jelly was soft and tasty. A great drink for the summer months!

As we were leaving the staff were super friendly to a new patron that's never had bbt and explained in detail what their drinks were! Very patient! Most bbt joints will probably want to push you off a cliff if you ask more than two questions! 

Definitely returning when the weathers warmer to enjoy their tea n walk down queen st!"}
{"text":"I recently came back from an overseas trip and had been craving Nohohon's Hojicha homebrew with tapioca.  Unfortunately, the tapioca was being cooked,but the barista recommended the grass jelly. After we recieved our order we hung out in the store for a bit. When we were about to finish, the barista mentioned that the tapioca was ready, and could offer us another bubble tea on the house. Seriously, customer service at its finest!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place, heard about it through my sister since she lives downtown. I'm always on a lookout for trying new bubble tea shops around, and Nohohon really stands out from the rest. 

Nohohon is the japanese version bubble tea unlike your typical 168's, Chatimes, Sharedtea's and etc. There version of making the drinks are unique and very refreshing. 

I definitely see a difference in the drink quality when compared to the rest. Nohohon has a very different approach when mixing and making their drinks. They use more natural mixtures of tea's and ingredients. I got the Tokyo Fog and it's green tea with vanilla and red bean as an extra topping. I was thinking that it would taste very vanilla like or a shot sorta.. but it actually didn't, and when shaken well the green tea flavor tastes very smooth and not too creamy. The red beans is probably by far the tastiest i've ever had in a drink in a long time. They were brewed very well, because I thought it would be a bit soft and soggy after being left in the drink for a while but it didn't turn out that way at all. It was still chewy and non mushy (if that's a good way to put it?)

The workers at the place are also very friendly as well. Definitely going to come back to try more different drinks again."}
{"text":"The good:

Perhaps the first Japanese bubble tea-like place in Toronto. Their drinks are full of interesting blends and uniqueness to it, but...

The bad:

I couldn't taste any matcha - even though its what they specialize in. Now I only tried two drinks, so I would go back to give it a try again. Who knows, it may change my mind :)

The neutral:

I was able to get a seat, but don't expect one if it's busy because there are only 4-5 spots."}
{"text":"Came here the other night and ordered just one greentea latte. The store looked quite nice in the front but inside.....beside the counter the poor gentleman was being swarmed alive by fruit flies. 

I felt so bad for the guy and I just hope i didnt consume too many of those little flies inside my drink. The drink that he made was just way too sweet and I wouldve preferred abit more thickness in the beverage. Perhaps this was aimed towards the younger crowd.

I just hope that poor server guy survived."}
{"text":"Get Tokyo Fog. I was neither a fan of matcha milk tea nor red bean but the Tokyo Fog has definitely changed my mind. After visiting Nohohon Tea Room, I've become obsessed with matcha and red bean but haven't found another tea shop that does it as tasty as them. It's either bland or too sweet, but Nohohon gets it just right.

The matcha macchiato was ok, my friend got it and we couldn't really taste the caramel. I don't know if that was intended, but get the Matcha Tokyo Fog...in large, or the biggest size they have.

The staff is really nice too, really helpful and friendly. The only thing that would've made my experience better was if this was a sit-down teashop. But otherwise, great. I'm looking forward to them expanding uptown so I can get more Tokyo Fog and try out everything else."}
{"text":"Nohohon is a cute, tiny tea store that specializes in matcha drinks. The menu is rather small, but they do offer lactose-free and sugar-free substitutes. It's not Taiwanese style- it's definitely Japanese, as you can probably tell from the matcha whisks, tatami seats and the small size of the tea room. (Seriously- a lot of Japanese cafés are the size of a cupboard.)

There's only one barista behind the counter, and if there happens to be one or two more people in front of you, you'll end up waiting for ages for your drink. Exercise patience while chilling in Nohohon! They accept vicinity, ritual, and they often have good deals on Instagram. As well, it's heated up soooo nicely during the winter- you'll feel snug and warm indoors.

The hot drinks taste so good on a cold winter day! However I did not like Furano Field, which was supposed to have lavender in it. They have other lavender drinks as well but I don't recommend them. I did enjoy the Tokyo Fog very much! It's supposed to have vanilla in it, and it's sweet but not overwhelming. I find the prices to be pretty normal for bubble tea joints- usually $5-$6 depending on what toppings you want to get.

I would definitely come back to try out their other drinks! And, maybe to try their onigiri? When I was here there was only 1 sad onigiri on the counter."}
{"text":"This is one of the cutest bubble tea places I've been to! It is a Japanese tea house setting inside and though it's small with about 8 seats, it's charming. 

I ordered the fresh taro smoothie with soy milk and tapioca, which really did taste fresh! My husband got the Tokyo Fog (matcha with vanilla) and tapioca. Both were delicious, though I would personally get the taro again on my next visit. 

The only con is the wait time. I waited about 15 minutes for my drink even though there were only 2 people in front of me. To be fair though, there was only one person working - he was at the cash register and making the drinks. Time and care was obviously put into the drinks though. Good customer service and $1 off when you check in on Yelp! Definitely recommend this place and will go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Always a great place to stay. Their customer service is number one in the city. Tokyo fog and latte are my lovessssss"}
{"text":"I'm not downtown as often anymore, but when I do, I will definitely stop by here as often as I can.

Pros:
No powder and refined sugar used at all
Macha drinks are hand made
Very nice owner

Cons:
No sitting area

There aren't too many places in the city that serve Japanese green tea.  When my GF heard about this place it was a given that we would come here. The place is a very tiny place.  You have the counter where you order, a small padded bench on the side and a little open space in the middle.  Very minimalist which works for this place.  

They have a good selection of drinks to choose from.  You have milk teas, macha, sencha and some fruity selections as well.  One thing to note is, unlike a lot of bubble tea places, this place uses no powder of any sort and no refined sugar as well. Also, I don;t know about all drinks, but the macha drinks we ordered were all hand made.  You can really taste the difference.

The owner of the place is super duper nice.  She was very helpful and had a ton of knowledge behind her products.  When it comes to tea, my GF loves to ask questions and she answered them all in depth.  She always has a pleasant smile and makes you feel welcome the moment you walk in.  

The only thing I can remotely gripe about is there are no seats available here.  There is a small padded bench to the side and that's it.  This place is strictly take out more or less.  Being downtown, you're usually on the go so it shouldn't bother most people at all.

I have a new fav place to get my tea fix downtown.  I'm not down often, but when I am I'll be sure to try and stop by again."}
{"text":"Fantastic bubble tea without artificial sweeteners or ingredients. Amazing service and lovely atmosphere. Among the best bubble tea I have had in Taiwan, Vancouver or Toronto! The owner is so nice and clearly passionate about her store and her products!"}
{"text":"Ordered Green Haze (matcha/hazelnut green tea) with red bean, while my friend got the original brew with vanilla. Both were fantastic! The shop has a really cute vibe too, and love the $1 off when you check in!"}
{"text":"I went here twice during our trip to Toronto. The first time was when we were early for a game at the Rogers Centre, and the other bubble tea place nearby didn't have good reviews, so we trekked up to Nohohon. It was a longer walk than we had anticipated, but it was well worth it, in my opinion. 

They pride themselves on not using the powdered bubble tea mix, and as expected, it is way better. They don't have an extensive menu, but sometimes that's a good thing. I had a hard time choosing what I wanted because everything looked yummy. 

I ended up going for the fresh taro smoothie with boba. It definitely didn't taste powdered because of the texture. It wasn't overly sweet and unmistakably had the taste of taro. They also have different milk options, which is always a plus for me, as I'm lactose-intolerant. Soy milk all the way, baby.
 
My boyfriend ended up with an iced Tokyo Fog, and he liked it a lot. On separate second trip, I got the Matcha Latte with soy milk, of course with boba. It was also pretty tasty. 

It was pretty hot in the small space when I stopped by both times. I don't know if it was because they were trying to save on the electricity bill, since the temperature was still mild - though it was starting to climb when we were there. 

I don't think you could really go with anything wrong here. The employees are friendly, and there was never a line when I was here. I wish they had a Nohohon back home - I would be there all the time. 


Overall: 4/5

{"text":"Came here in a weekday afternoon. I was a bit hungry so I ordered one onigiri and a drink for myself. 
The onigiri is a bit pricy compare to the other Japanese restaurant. I find the drink is more compelling. I was overwhelmed by the lavender brew tea that written on the menu once I got into the store and it becomes one of my favourites now. It is a healthier version of milk tea or bubble tea. If I am around the area, I would definitely coming back to try out the other drinks."}

{"text":"3.5* Service was very friendly, girl behind the counter also gave some recommendations.  Not really a \"tea room\" as there are literally 3 tables, so I wouldn't really feel comfortable lingering here, especially if it's busy!

I *love* the concept of Nohohon being a bubbletea place...without the junky, who-know-what's-inside powders and overloaded sugars.  However, I guess I chose the wrong drink?  I got Furano Field which is supposed to be a matcha latté with lavender.  Unfortunately, the lavender was completely absent in my drink.  Matcha was a bit bitter, but I'd rather that than chalk full of refined sugar.

Limited, but full menu is here, so you can pre-order:

I'd definitely go back to try other things on the menu, but I don't think I'd order the Furano again."}
{"text":"Solid 4-Star Bubble Tea Shop in Toronto. Definitely one of the better places I have been to outside of NYC. It was a cold rainy day in Toronto (visiting in April) and we were thirsting for some bubble tea. We came across this gem on our search and decided to try it out. I got the traditional milk tea bubble tea... and lemee tell you... it was fantastic! Many places make their bubble tea from powdered (w/o real tea) but not here! You can absolutely taste the difference. Definitely planning on coming back here next time I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I had the taro latte and it was the best thing ever. Thank you for the recommendation. It was made with real taro, the drink was thicker than normal tea but super smooth and homey. Love it"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of bubble tea, so i had to check out Nohohon. It looked like a traditional Japanese take on the drink. The service was great. She was very friendly and explained the different drinks, what her favorite was, etc. I also appreciate that they have almond and soy milk options!

I had the Furano Field (lavendar + matcha) with almond milk. My bf had the Momo Oolong. Both were very good and light and not overly sweet. The tapioca bubbles were perfectly chewy. The drinks in general are much more naturally made than the usual bubble teas nowadays which have artificially flavored syrups/powders and colors. 

I loved the Japanese-themed interior as well. It was small with only two tables, but quiet and enjoyable to sit for a while and read."}
{"text":"I gave Nohohon a second try because the owner had reached out to me after my first experience which was only OK. 

I tried another drink on their menu instead this time, the Matcha Macchiato which was much better than what I had last time. With no alteration to their own formula, this had the right sweetness for me and the hint of caramel is really good. I added red bean in the topping which complemented the drink very well.

Service was really good and one of the girls there would run to open the door for you as you leave. She was doing this for as many people as possible! 

Glad I tried this place again."}
{"text":"I came here last week with my boyfriend. The interior is small but cozy and well decorated. There was one employee working the cash and preparing the drinks. This, along with the fact that this place prefers to steep and use more natural ingredients rather than colourful powders, made the wait longer than your usual tea shop.

All of the drinks are made with almond milk or soy milk, and things like agave and real taro. The result is a very toned down, more natural tasting drink. The regular sugar level is really not that high at all compared to other places, and you can adjust the sugar level. I only wish there was a dairy option, as almond milk and soy milk are a lot less rich and impart a thinner, different flavour, however I suspect that this place may be striving to be gluten-free vegan, so that may be why. 

I ordered a fresh taro smoothie and my boyfriend got their regular matcha latte, hot. Unfortunately, they were out of boba at the time. The taro smoothie was unlike any other taro sweet I've had, and that is because it was made with actual taro. There were no strong flavours, no bright purple colour, just a thick and lightly sweet smoothie. The matcha latte tasted a little thinner and not as rich as I was used to. There was also a distinct lack of bitterness for some reason.

I am giving this place 4 stars because it is a nice atmosphere, and I like the concept. I feel a lot of people who want to enjoy a healthier treat will like this place. Personally, I prefer the stronger tastes of the less natural versions, but for anyone who complains about drinks being too sweet these days this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is good! Very refreshing and satisfy the thirst. But there was nothing very special about the drinks. The drink did not stand out as compared to coco or chatime. The portion is also a lot smaller than usual. The small only had about 8 pieces of tapioca. I got the Tokyo fog, matcha and the taro smoothie. Would recommend to some friends."}
{"text":"You definitely don't want to miss this Japanese tea shop. Their Mocha Latte is great. If you check in there on Yelp you will receive a coupon ;)"}
{"text":"Tiny shop specializing in Japanese style drinks. The staff are pretty friendly and patient - there's only one of them taking orders and making drinks so it is a small wait though never much of a line. I usually get the hot Nohohon Homebrew, Original ($4), a milk tea with Hojicha (roasted green tea). The tea is really toasty and strong, which is nice during the colder months. Generally people seem to take out but there's a small amount of seating and it's a comfy environment. You can collect points on a vicinity card here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Their level of customer service goes beyond typical bubble tea shop service- the workers are so friendly and go so far to please customers by opening doors for them and delivering straws to their tables. It's also neat how they strive to use quality ingredients in their drinks and offer lactose-free substitutes for the lactose challenged (like myself).

As for the taste of their drinks.. 
-The Furano fields was a bit too watered down but the lavender was definitely there
-The matcha-on-the-rocks had a mild sweetness which didn't smother the matcha flavour 
-The hojicha milk tea with lavender was again mildly sweet. I think they use agave as their sweetener.

I feel like they haven't gotten their tapioca down pat, it always seems to be undercooked. I also had the gomoku onigiri which was tasty though it was sweet, which was unexpected. 

Although I know this place is meant to be healthier and uses more wholesome ingredients than other bubbletea shops.. It just makes me crave chatime to be honest. The flavours just don't appeal to me."}
{"text":"Exceptional service right when I walked into the store and left! I thought the lady behind the counter was the owner but she said how she was in NY opening the second Nohohon store there. She was very bubbly, I loved her personality. I will for sure be coming back here to try their other drinks!

I ordered the Tokyo fog with tapioca and I was surprised. I expected it to be sweet but it was not too sweet which made the matcha flavor stronger. There was also hints of vanilla which I loved!! I see myself buying this again someday"}
{"text":"Ordered the fresh taro with pearls and it was so yummy just the perfect subtle amount of sweetness. Its great they don't use taro powder and they offer almond or soy milk. The one staff member working was also so courteous, he held the door open for us as we left. 

I have tried the matcha with lavender milk tea previously and the tip is to stir the drink before you sip it since all the lavender syrup/taste settles at the bottom. Perhaps I let my drink sit too long so it was a bit watery when I had it."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

I love anything matcha. So I was excited to try out what Nohohon Tea Room offers.

Calling this a tea room is a little deceiving as it is more like a takeout place, so don't expect to leisurely sipping your tea in a zen like environment. Nohohon Tea Room can be so busy at times with more than a handful of people waiting in line to order and waiting for their drinks.

Drinks are hit and miss, at least with the ones I tried. 

Tokyo Fog with Red Bean (Cold) - a tradtional combination which is really good,
Matcha Latte (Hot) - taste was balance and you can really taste the matcha 
Forano Field (Hot) - Skip! More like a waterdown milk with water, matcha/lavender both MIA
Matcha Caramel with Glass Jello (Cold) - Meh, 

I might try some other more matcha intensive drink next time: Hot Matcha Straight. And some other Yuzu drinks which should be quite refreshing.

The owner and staff here are all so friendly and cheerful. True Japanese hospitality!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and although the bubble tea is pretty interesting, it's not quite memorable but does make you want to go back for more. The matcha tea I had one time tasted like fish (a sign that it has gone bad according to Google). None of the bubble teas are too sweet, they're actually quite the opposite, the sweetness is faint so you really taste the quality of the tea.

Shame they're closed right now and was replaced by yet another bubble tea place."}
{"text":"After  finishing lunch in the area, my friends and I were craving some bubble tea and were intrigued by the drink descriptions and pictures from Yelp! The establishment itself is very small (two four-person tables and one two-seater) so don't expect to stay there on a crowded day. There was one very sweet lady behind the counter running the show by herself. I absolutely loved her bright attitude, but in terms of efficiency, expect to have to wait to place your order let alone get your drink if there's more than three people in line. 

As for the drinks itself, I ordered the Green Haze (matcha tea with hazelnut cream, red bean, and tapioca) while others got the Vanillabrew. My Green Haze looked amazing, with the vibrant colors and layers. The redbean and tapioca were fine but I didn't quite enjoy the blend of the matcha powder with the milk. My companions were even less fans of the Vanillabrew, which frankly, tasted mostly like water. 

Overall, a very cute tea shop which probably specializes in tea (I'm assuming,) moreso than the actual sweet dessert drinks. If you're looking for a bubble tea fix, I might look elsewhere."}
{"text":"While I appreciate the idea of a high end bubble store, I did not enjoy the Original brew Hojicha bubble tea at Nohohon Tea ($4.25). 

The tapioca lacks the resistance I come to love with typical bubble tea. The tea flavour is not pronounced. Unfortunately, it tasted watered down to me. In my (potentially bias) opinion, steeped tea used for milk tea should be over steeped slightly. The bitterness and acidity from over steeped tea will be subdued by the addition of milk and add depth to the drink. I also did not enjoy tea cookies at Nohohon. It was not enjoyable.  

The only item I enjoyed  from Nohohon Tea is the Tokyo Fog ($3.95); matcha, vanilla, and froth milk. It is a drink I welcome on a cold night.

All in all, I don't see myself visiting Nohohon Tea again unless I am in desperate need of bubble tea and the rest of Toronto ran out of tapioca. It cost more than an average bubble tea and quality of the flavour is inferior."}
{"text":"Had their matcha bubble tea at  their stall in   Japan festival  and it was quite good. It has a richness to it that many other places do not have.  The tapiocas were not hard and it was perfect for the hot wewther I  want to  try more teas when it reopens ."}
