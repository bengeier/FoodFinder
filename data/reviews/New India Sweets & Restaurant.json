{"text":"went to this restaurant again .. it just gets better .. the naan and tandoori roti were just amazing.. so fresh, crisp and well done..  love the food... must try ..."}
{"text":"July 20, 2016:  still love this place!  Their prices have gone up a bit as w most places around; it's still delicious food at a reasonable price.  They have updated inside so I would think of it as a clean ma and pa shop to have a home cooked style healthy meal.  Good value and healthy options available, what more could a gal ask for?"}
{"text":"Our go to Indian restaurant. This place may not be the most modern in its decor but the taste and quality is on point. Initially, I was drawn in by their samosas as per the suggestion of other yelpers. Which might I say we're incredibly filled, large and delicious! Then we decided to test out their sweets, omg delicious. So many different selections and always so rich and flavourful. We religiously get a pound at least every time we go by. We then tried their meat thali which came with fresh naan and meat biryani. It was amazing. Not crazy about their tandoori chicken though. We're not afraid to experiment and it certainly pays off. The portions are very filling and the price is also very reasonable. Staff are also quite friendly and helpful. A must must must try."}
{"text":"Good food, but a bit too salty. Wished there were more vegetables in the meal. The onions tasted strong."}
{"text":"Delicious food... especially for the price! :)
More or less a \"dhaba\" style restaurant... with fast service!
My buddy and I had a full meal and a drink each for less than $20."}
{"text":"My fav place in Mississauga for an Indian meal. Highly recommend the Chana"}
{"text":"My family has been ordering take out from here for years. It has authentic Indian food that is very affordable. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me be clear - my ratings are always based on the food and to some extent, courteousness of the staff - not the ambience/decor.  As per other reviews, don't expect to be wowed by the atmosphere, but go for the food!

We just returned from dinner at this place, and were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was.  The dal fry was exceptional, as were the various breads we tried.

We also found the 2 young ladies behind the counter to be friendly and courteous (another pleasant surprise).

The price is right too, so definitely a place to go for authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"I like this place and have bought veg samosas and pakoras many times. They stuff is quite fresh but it could be cold some times. The samosas are decent but pakoras are too dry not much in them. 

I have also bought some methi (sweets) although its not the best but does the job on an average level. They have a lot of other things and I like to try some more thing."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this little restaurant for a number of years and its always been good.  Affordable pricing, fresh and tasty food.  Dine-in or Take-out.  Although dine in is a little 'cafeteria-ish'..  but its good for just a quick bite.

they have a pretty decent menu selection of typical north indian dishes.  and plenty of sweets too.  Its like a fast-food counter so service doesn't need to be much, but they manage to be friendly.

I'd recommend It for Indian food in the area, ideally for take out and then relax and eat at home.  They have good Channa Bhatura, and Chicken Biryani.  I haven't tried all their stuff but I'm sure it is all reasonable to delicious!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here for the channa bhatura. The bhatura is very fresh and light- can even be eaten by itself because it's so delicious! 

When we went today we noticed that they have increased prices and lessened quantity of food. This came as a surprise. Also as I was eating my meal I noticed that there was a thick thread that was stuck to my bhatura. Very disappointing. 

I think from now on we will try to go to sweet India instead as their prices are better and quantity is better as well."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and both times i've been super satisfied. They have daily lunch specials for a great price that comes with a big piece of naan! The butter chicken is a little spicy so I sweat by the time i'm finished lol but it's so worth it! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years, I've always loved their samosas and still do, one of the best I've ever had. 

I also had some tikka masala chicken and naan. The naan was delicious and so fresh, but the tikka masala chicken had more vegetables then meat, and the chicken was hard and dry. Could have been a bad batch, but who knows. 

They have a small dine in section but it is more of a grab and go kind of place. 

Would have given more stars if the chicken wasn't so disappointing, because the samosas are excellent."}
{"text":"Personally my favourite take-out Indian in Mississauga. I call the place \"Cheap and Cheerless\", but in NO WAY is that derogatory. The chili chicken, rice and Chana are great! But start with some Pakoras and sauce and a vegetarian samosa. I always have leftovers for next day's lunch! Excellent value. Too bad they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Was in a bind and needed to bring something quick to a potluck, so decided to give this place a try, again.  Ten veggie samosas and ten chicken samosas came up to fifteen bucks.  It wasn't bad actually, it maybe became better than the last time I was here? It's not too flour-y anymore, it's not oily, which is good, it was really stuffed, which is good, however, it doesn't have a complex spice flavour.  People seemed to like the sauces it came with.  I guess it's not too bad because it's not oily and does have a lot of filling.  However, I think it is quite expensive!"}
{"text":"Takeout order:  Butter Chicken, Aloo Gobi, Mixed Veg and Channa Masala. 

Got home and opened up my large containers of takeout and this is what appeared before me:

Channa Masala not submersed in a two centimetre protective layer of Ghee?!  
Aloo Gobi not soaked in lovely red Ghee-goodness?!  
Mixed Vegetables not dripping wet with reddy Ghee goo?  What the heck?!  
I can't even imagine not pouring Ghee out of my take out containers. Dabbing my food with paper towel to soak up excessive amounts of Ghee. What is happening here?!
In so much denial, I begin to load my plate of homemade Veg Biriyani with spoonfuls of of this culinary mirage. Bite after bite. Inspection of each spoonful. Huge chunks of chicken. Gravy.  Cauliflower, peppers, onions. Flavours?  Spices?  Nom Nom Nom.   
Verdict in Two words:  
YUMMY DELICIOUSNESS!!!  
Where has his place been all my life?  This was our first time ordering from NI and won't be the last.  One Star for wowing me about the Ghee and Three additional Stars for taste. I have to check this place out again for consistency. Follow up review to come.  Sorry about not having pics. The ghee less poods distracted me. Lol. 
Peace!"}
{"text":"What a amazing hidden gem. Excellent food. We ordered so many different items that I'm not sure what we got but every dish was unbelievably tasty. The flavours were just right. Everything was perfect. I will definitely go back there for my next Indian take out.  The service was very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Our main place for Samosas.  Being close is a bonus. I have not had an chance to try other items but is definitely on my list.  But Samosas are very good, and good price. Can't complain.  More of a take out place."}
{"text":"Oh man! What an incredible gem of a place.

While driving back from Toronto the US we stopped here for lunch and grabbing some sweets back. We got the milk cake, gajar halwa cake, jilebis and kalakand. They were sooo good. I offered some to my Indian friends back home in Pittsburgh and they all loved it too. The price is inexpensive too.. about 5-8 CAD for 1lb of sweets.

Coming to the lunch, we got the chicken tikka masala and channa batura. They were so good. The channa batura was completely homestyle and reminded us of restaurants back in India. Although it seems more of  a take out kind of place, we stopped there for lunch as we wanted to get something quick on our drive back.

I want to go back there to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent food anything you order exceeds expectations!! We come here for aloo parathas 
They are super excellent 
The chicken sweets anything u order is really amazing 
We come here twice a month and go back feeling happy about the food we ve had
Papri chaat , chicken samosas everything exceeds expectation"}
{"text":"Note:  This is primarily a takeout joint.  Do not bring your family in-tow and expect a waiter serviced meal.

Ordered:  Veg Biryani ($5.99, as per Benny's suggestion) & Butter Chicken ($6.25).

If this place was in Brampton/Scarb, the prices would be considered a bit high.  3 samosas/$1.50 is special price for The White Man/person who doesn't have much options in the area.

Front of shop needs a facelift, let's be honest here.  Reminds me of Lazeez, down the street.  Could use a repainting and a nice scrub down.  Lady behind the counter could've cracked a smile or exchanged some sort of pleasantry...but she didn't.  Looked a bit miserable to me, but hey, it's not fine dining.

Veg Biryani - Was good, did have a depth of flavour.  This may seem menial, but I *loved* the fresh chopped onions, carrot pickle, & that green sauce that came in a smaller, separate container.  I put that stuff right on top of my biryani!

Butter Chicken - Hmm...I'm mixed about this.  It was awh-ight.  Chicken was off the bone and it seemed as though it was cooked separately then thrown in the gravy.  Sauce was ok too.  Not the best that I've had and certainly not the worse.

So if you're in the area and feel like an Indian takeout, it's ok.  However, I wouldn't drive out of my way for it!"}
{"text":"Amazing value for money. None of the restaurants in the area have prices as low as this restaurant. And the quality here is on par with the others. The ambience isn't that great but why not get take out instead? Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I would give negative stars. Pani puri was horrible, bitter taste. Other snacks were stale (aloo vada and some veg kababs). Stay away. Horrible"}
{"text":"I moved to Mississauga in '96 and have been coming here since then.  Hands down the best samosas I've had.  And of course your Indian favorites are fantastic:  butter chicken, naan and Briyani.  Over ten years later and it still has the same authentic taste.    Always worth the drive from Toronto.  =)"}
{"text":"I went and ordered veg thali(not recommended ever)


After picking up the thali brought it home it had a half eat'n cucumber ,  the supposed to be dall makhni was actually some thing else and chickpeas portion was literally gravy.

Never going back  
Thanks for giving indian veg thali a bad name"}
