{"text":"All the food here was completely to die for. We had the chicken tikka masala, and the idda? Not sure how to spell it, or what it was called. Both had amazing flavor, and plenty of it. The complementary desert was also very good, and gave a nice ending to the delicious meal. I would highly recommend this to a friend, and will definitely come back for more some time soon."}
{"text":"Many great options in the buffet (both veg and non-veg). Simple and nice decor. But overall, the food is great. Located in the C-Fu Gourmet shopping complex. My favorite are the dosas and chutneys. Awesome Indian food in Chandler!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with the food. We ordered carry out and waited at the restaurant while it was made. As soon as we got home ten minutes later, we found that the idli was cold and hard. The sambar was the worst I've ever had in my life...so salty it wasn't edible. The chutney tasted like it was spoilt, and overall everything we ordered was extremely oily. Not very impressed with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Poor quality of food.. Had ordered for Masala Dosa for to go.. It was shocking to see burnt aloo masala inside the dosa at my home"}
{"text":"food here is average with poor quality
for example paneer butter masala was lime water with no paneer and few onions
and place is not very hygenic
the owner took order from folks and took payments written something on paper for phone order cleaned tables and he went to kitchen put masala stuff on the dosa with bare hands and rolled dosa with bare left and right hand. come on atleast use plastic gloves it so gross
not going again"}
{"text":"I normally do not review, and having worked in food service before, I do my best to give the benefit of my doubt to the restaurant. But my experience taking out food involved chicken bones where there wasn't supposed to be any and inedibley salted dishes. The only things we could eat we're the mango lassi and plain rice. Avoid going."}
{"text":"Best veggie biryani hands down!!! Mouth watering aroma and same great taste with exact right proportions of spices every time.  Can never go wrong with this biryani.Reminds me of the famous biryani from paradise restaurant in hyderabad. Reasonable price as well - for 9$ you get more than enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"\"My rating is for the food not the place to eat! Get take out! Little or no AC. The chicken and lamb dishes were good but the Bhindi was dry.\"

I will likely go back and pick up take out but I would NOT eat there!"}
{"text":"Lover of biryani?? Are you in town ??? If you don't eat biryani here then consider you wasted yourselves for not having biryani here. Lamb biryani and ulavacharu chicken biryani are the best. They taste like authentic Hyderabadi biryani. I strongly recommend lamb biryani."}
{"text":"Great place if you are craving for authentic Indian food. Don't expect attractive ambience or special arrangements, better for pick ups. I tried Chicken dum biriyani, Chicken tikka masala and Garlic naan, and my taste buds were satisfied for sure!!"}
{"text":"We arrived 4:30 PM (the door was opened with a chair) and the owner was laying on the chairs with his feet up on the table, in the dining room, on the phone and told us they're closed until 5 PM. 
I can't say anything about their food but I can say their service is atrocious. Good luck to those who come here in the future, I hope they clean the tables for their guests sake."}
{"text":"Best place for Dum biryani in Phoenix.

In fact best biryani I have even had in this country. Unfortunately other restaurants all have their own versions of biryani and call it as traditional dum biryani."}
{"text":"The food here was good! We really loved the naan.

We would have given the place 4 stars, but we knocked it down a star because the price is a bit much for a vegetarian meal and counter service. The vegetarian options were around the same price as the meat options. Garbanzo beans and lentils are much cheaper than lamb and beef!"}
{"text":"Sigh, I stopped going here because their omission rate was quite high.
You're likely missing one thing or another.
Whether it be rice, piece of samosa, or a drink,... something was missing on every occasion.
make sure you check EVERYTHING before you leave with your to go bag.
Most likely, something will be missing.
The customer ahead of me was missing parts of his order too.
Its sad.

The food varies depends on when you go / who makes it.
Inconsistency... sometimes the chicken tikka masala and chicken makhani are excellent,
other times its sad and runny and bland.

Mango lasses are still consistently good.

Hit or miss. I stopped disappointing myself and stopped going."}
{"text":"Horrible..!!! Just one word.. Didn't like the food at all. Fell sick after eating the crappy biryani .

This is not the franchise of bawarchi.."}
{"text":"We have been buying briyani here for couple of times of week, initially it was good then gradually we had spoiled meat for atlst thrice and we did tell the owner about it and he got so annoyed and response was so harsh. He hardly heard what we spoke and we did tell him very politely and now we stopped going there. I am seriosuly thinking to write to Food safety inspector about the meat used here. It was so smelly(Bad) as soon we opened it once back home. We cant eat there so obviously we see only after we eat at home and they denied to accept the truth. I have never seen such a worst behaviour of the owner. So pls dont say he is kind he was very rude when u tell him the truth. Cleaniness is must i guess"}
{"text":"No customer  service  .I had goat biryani  today I was smiling  bad I think  its  was old biryani  .raitha  was to salty biryani  gravy is to watery."}
{"text":"I waited for atleast 2 visits and 4 dishes before i wrote this review. I believe we have a winner. Go to this place for the food and food alone. This is not a place for dining out, neither the location nor the ambience inside point to that. It is great for take out ( they serve pretty quickly so not much of a wait)  Prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly and the food is tasty. I have had the daal, aloo gobhi, andhra chicken and gosht biryani. All good. I will be back to sample the rest."}
{"text":"If you want only vegetarian food, then this is a good place. I happen to be an omnivore, so I'm a little biased (booooo!!!) Anyway, I've been here twice, so that says a lot. This place is good, just not a lot of selection in their buffet. How many times can you cook lentil different ways? LOL! In fairness though, their food is tasty and the place is bright. I always come for the buffet lunch so I can try a lot of different dishes and I think you should too if you are not familiar with Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Extremely oily food. Every bite i eat, i felt oil was oozing out and it was not tasty either.Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Used to be a good place to eat. Now customer service has declined a great deal. We were there on Dec 1,2015. We were given burnt food to eat. When informed, the owner/ manager said,\" how can it be? I made it in front of you only\". 

He refused to acknowledge that he had not been tending to the grill all the time.  He had been having a conversation with his staff, and attended a phone call too in the time our food was on the grill. Instead of apologizing or offering to make another one, his attitude of defiance and defensiveness spoiled our evening. 

We did not want to create a scene in front of other customers. However, we are not going back there, EVER. 

This is a family business. If this is the kind of customer service people receive,  wonder how long it will continue as a family business."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by a very pleasant and helpful manager named Jay. We put in a large order of butter paneer masala and naan for a party, it was a hit. delicious."}
{"text":"I got the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread. Everything was all right. Nothing super fancy. The chicken had clumps of some spice that I couldn't tell you what it was. However, I wasn't pleased with that as it was an overpower explosion of spice in a few bites that I discovered those.. The naan bread was rather rubbery and the garlic tasted sweet. 
To be honest with you though, it did taste really good and for the price that I paid, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I are a regular at this place.  It was very good and very spicy. It has several vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Andhra Chicken curry and palak paneer r the best"}
{"text":"Quality is down and I hate to see this happen. Mutton biryani is my favorite and I used to order one every Friday. I noticed lately that the meat content has gone down significantly. Now I have to order two biryanis to get the quantity equivalent to one. This makes it very expensive compared to others. I am on my quest to find a better biryani place.. Their Andhra Chicken Curry is still the best in the Valley."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Owner thinks that he gives free food. His attitude is like he is  a master chef. I ordered biryani from them and ask them to make less spicy 3 times.  He totally ignored it and gave me shitty stuff. I have to feed that to old parents so they can enjoy but bawarchi just ruined it. Not recommended it all.."}
{"text":"Great food. Inside seems a little crazy when busy but manageable. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'm normally not one to criticize but had to write because I had THE worst customer service experience EVER!!!!  VERY rude owner and the place was so dirty!!!  Will never go back again and would never recommend anyone to go there period! There are plenty of other good Indian food options in the area."}
{"text":"It's more like a 3.5.

Pros: good chicken tikka masala, pretty good naan, yummy samosas, spicy but not too spicy, very reasonably priced and good for takeout, friendly service

Cons: The dal curry had a strange consistency. Echoing some of the earlier comments the restaurant isn't that clean. Also not a germaphobe and have lower expectations for hole-in-the-wall/mom and pop shops, but still seemed like it wasn't clean enough."}
{"text":"Food quality has gone down a lot. Biryani rice is properly cooked. 
Highly inconsistent. Take out chicken biryani had no chicken"}
{"text":"I wld give 0... The worst hospitality I have ever seen.. Ordered biriyani  but had to wait for 45 mns.
U can find better restaurants.."}
{"text":"I've been to most places in phoenix, and this the only place in town where u get real Biriyani,(in the name of Biriyani many cook masala rice) i would definitely recommend them for any Mughal cuisine."}
{"text":"Chicken biryani is awesomely spicy! I lucked out and had a regular give me some tips on what to order. Try any one of the naans as well, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place made too good biryanis until Jan. I have no idea what happened here, but the taste and over all quality has gone down."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience..I don't know what other people are talking about? It seems like they are perhaps talking about some other place!!
I went here for dinner with my wife..I really wanted to like this place and the food but there was nothing to like about this place or the food. The dum biriyani was served cold and one can tell from the texture and appearance of the meat that it was not fresh..the portion size was horrible!!
Chicken Makhani...a few pieces of chicken breast smothered with a very monotonous and tasteless sauce..was a complete culinary  failure.
Seekh kabab was not available...instead I ordered chicken boti kabab...a few big chunks of grilled white chicken breast coated with orange color and served on a bed of stale lettuce!! I was so pissed off just looking at that thing!! There was not even a hint of flavor in that dish.
I understand that you are trying to keep the cost low through self service..but it's not worth it. The customer has no idea where paper napkins are? where the disposable dishes are?
I have dined at several places in the valley and I have a very good idea of what Indian food should taste like..this place was not even close.
Please save yourself some money and time..prepare some good food yourself or eat elsewhere to avoid the disappointment."}
{"text":"I usually write reviews if something is too good or too bad. I go here because it is the nearest non veg Indian restaurant to my neighboorhood.
In this case, I can say 5 star for Biryani  and 1 star for service and ethics. 
Other than Biryani, palak panner is good. Rest items are not good. Chicken Biryani comes in 2 style viz. a Regular chicken Biryani b Special Chicken Biryani. ALWAYS go for regular chicken biryani, because special Biryani is nothing but flavored rice with  pieces of boneless red pepper chicken. 

Now coming to service part, ok its usually self service style. I can't expect a service of 5 star restaurant. However there are 2 hosts, one guy (aged between 25 - 35) he is fine, another guy ( aged over 35) he is very  rude and he don't know what are professional ethics. When I order something he behaves as if he is doing some huge favor to me, and Once I went to the restaurant between 9:20 pm -  9:30 pm, he sees me as a criminal and rudely says KITCHEN IS CLOSED(In Caps intended)."}
{"text":"It used to be good but it has turned to be bad, both service and quality of food.
The chicken Bryani always comes with egg. But I ordered a few times since few months ago,it came without the egg. When I called to ask, the answer from them was \"we are out of egg!\" How can you out of eggs for so many times???? How can you increased your price and reduced your ingredients? Fry's store is nearby the restaurant. If you knew you are out of eggs, why don't you get it at fry's store or tell your customer in advance and give discount??

I ordered tandoori chicken but it came without sauce. I asked whether there is green sauce come together with the chicken and she said yes. But when I reached home, there was no green sauce....

I used to give 5 star but now I edit my review to 1 star....."}
{"text":"The only and only thing about this place is the ThumsUp cans available here. I've ordered a Chicken Spl Biryani and Chicken tikka kabab. The biryani was extremely bland and I had to search for the damn chicken in it. 

The only way i can describe the Tikka kabab is Pieces of boiled (one or two semi boiled) chicken with red paint and some kind of Everest masala sprinkled on them. I went upto the serving lady and asked her to add something to make it tastier and guess ehat she does!? She sprinkles red chilli powder on them and gives it to me. 

I enjoyed the boiling heat outside this place better. 0 stars"}
{"text":"I frequent this place since it was opened.Dum biryani is my favorite on the menu. Having said that, the owner has really lowered the quality lately. Most of the time it was not fresh, especially on Monday through Thursday. You would be lucky to have fresh and delicious biryani on weekdays.

The owner gets rude if I asked him whether the biryani is fresh. several times he claimed to be fresh but it turned out that the biryani must have been leftover from at least a day ago."}
{"text":"Great Biryani!  I mean really great Biryani!

Sure, it looks like a mom and pop operation tucked into a tiny store front, and the atmosphere is not \"dine in.\". The small kitchen is visible from the customer area. I like that.  The owner is friendly.  I like that too.

Listen, curry is curry. And the curry here is good, but no better than expected. The Palak Paneer and the Dal Curry that I've tried were very good, but they are not the draw.  

If you like Biryani -- and I love Biryani -- then you owe it to yourself to order Biryani here. The flavor is great, the accompaniments are spot on, and this is absolutely the best  Biryani I've found in the Phoenix and Scottsdale area.  You'll find a few whole spices in the Biryani; a whole clove, a pod of cardamom ... yum!  And you'll find a whole boiled egg, another gem in the mix.

This is the only restaurant in the area that is serving great Biryani instead of passing off fried rice (or worse, Rice-a-Roni) as  Biryani!   I've tried the goat, lamb, and the chicken Biryani.  Not being a fan of small chicken bones, I found the Lamb Biryani to be the best.

This place is now one of my weekly stops for dinner."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the non-meat portions of the menu, but everything is very good and spicing levels are seemingly authentic. Everything is quite creamy/buttery when ordered, like dosa, samosa, and the curries, and therefore quite rich. Their masalas, chutnies, sambar, etc. and curry sauces are all quite good. Naan is medium sized. I would recommend methu vada, idli, masala dosa, if you like southern Indian foods, the sambar is very good with it. Navaratna koorma, aaloo palak and some of the best among veg curries. Biryani is good, but I am used to Singaporean/Malaysian Tamil style where they serve on a banana leaf with a bowl of curry sauce, and without this briyani always seems dry to me, though theirs is quite good for this style. Rice pudding is inexpensive, and very good, when available. Counter/cafe style, well spiced recipes for a mostly Indian clientele, quick service, very well priced."}
{"text":"I wish they had more variety of food.  It is limited and I wish they actually had some good drinks too."}
{"text":"Dum Biryani is hard to find in Phoenix and this is the only place I know that sells Hyderabadi Dum Biryani. I tried the Veg Biryani and Egg Biryani and they taste good. Sometimes the gravy that accompanies the Biryani is watery. The Egg Biryani is especially good when made separately with what they call special biryani rice. But sometimes they just include a boiled egg with the veg biryani and call it the egg biryani.
I've tried the Navratna Koorma several times and it always tastes good but it is sometimes diluted.
I've also tried the Paneer Makhni which was very diluted, bland and had very few cubes of paneer. So you have to be careful with what you order. Biryani is a safe bet, these guys are the best in the valley for Biryani!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Customer service is good and they are very friendly. Try the Chicken Masalla."}
{"text":"The food is mostly pretty good. Not a place to dine in. Small stuffy and hot, with the hot oil & burners in close vicinity to the seats. The biryani & chicken curry are good. Paneer mattar (ie., cheese with peas) is a waste, you get 3 pieces of paneer floating in curry or 4 if you're lucky. Being in Scottsdale, decent Indian food is hard to come by. So this little hole in the wall stands out! It is on the spicy side, which is great if you like that. The big plus is... they recently opened an Indian grocery store next door. They have a good variety of spices, daals etc."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the outstanding and friendly service. The spinach deep fired was awesome. I did not care for the chicken (some number). I will definately go back for the Rice \"POODING\""}
{"text":"Food is/was good and cheap. Everything else like customer service, cleanliness etc is 1/5. Multiple times I them to separate out the potatoes in the Dosa for take out so it doesn't get soggy(they do it 1/2 the time and the other half I get a dirty look if I make them do it. Sometimes they will forget to give the items that come with the order in take out. Since the younger guy showed up the quality and quantity of food(esp. the biryani) has gone down. This is depressing because the food initially was incredible good and price was cheap. With they few changes they could have been THE indian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Trying a few traditional dishes. The food is pretty good but make sure it's to go. Not an attractive place to eat. Paper plates and plastic forks and spoons."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Unclean place. The workers were rude. You get a feeling like as if the person who's serving food hasn't taken bath in a while. It is very dirty. The restroom's doors don't have a proper lock. There was no soap, tissue papers of anything inside. 
They were alarmed when we asked them to clean our table. Definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness yummy chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. SO HAPPY to see a good Indian place on this side of town. I think businesses come and go in the shopping center these guys are in though so eat there! So I can continue to eat there. :)"}
{"text":"finally a great place for curry near me right off the 51! have gone here several times and always impressed. i cant waiver from the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan, but thank god my gf gets the palak paneer so i can get another awesome flavor change. i am yet to see another white person in there when i go so you know its authentic, but very clean and professional. small inside so we normally get it to go and there has never been a mistake made"}
{"text":"Worse Biryani I ever had in my life because I felt sick after eating this.
Place is very poorly maintained. There are lot of better options in the market."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It is definitely a family run place and operates mainly on take out orders. I ordered the vegetable samosas, garlic naan and the lamb biryani to eat there. While I waited for my food, I saw at least 5 customers pick up their to go orders.
The samosas came with a mint chutney and curry sauce. It was delicious. I did ask for tamarind chutney, which they did not have or they ran out of. I couldn't tell. My garlic naan was good as well. Soft and with a good amount of garlic. I did not specify my spice level, but my biryani was perfect. It was a good medium hot. It came with a curry and yogurt sauce. I will admit the spiciness caused me to cry a little, but the owner offered me more yogurt sauce to combat it. So nice! The lamb was so good! A good amount of meat and it tasted homemade. Since I ate there he offered me a taster of the bread pudding they had for dessert. I did not order it. It was just okay. Will definitely go back for take out this time!"}
{"text":"We were looking for Indian cuisine around this part of town and trusty ol' Yelp directed us to this hidden gem.  This restaurant is nestled right next to the 51 in a tiny little cluster of shops.  Underwhelming when you walk in, and the first thing I noticed was despite the 109 degree temperature outside, the interior of this restaurant was even hotter.  But we really wanted Indian :)

For $8.99 we ordered the chicken Masala and for another $3.50, two pieces of large naan bread, cut in half.  One plain, and one garlic.  I found the coolest place in the small restaurant (right next to the soda cooler) and we waited for the food to come out.

The food was served on Styrofoam plates which for me, is a negative.  But this was hands down the best Chicken Masala I've ever had.  The flavor was spot on with just enough heat but not too much.  The garlic naan was incredible, and the plain naan was as expected.  The dish was served with a plate of jasmine rice cooked to perfection.  

I'd say that one dish was certainly enough for two people- I did not leave feeling hungry nor did I leave feeling uncomfortably full.  

The bathroom.. well, it left things to be expected.  Wasnt necessarily the cleanest faciity but I wasnt there for the bathrooms, after all.

Despite its quirks, I can say with certainty that we will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Vindaloo for takeout.  When I got home, it was in a small container which was mostly sauce--maybe 4 slivers of chicken.  It came with rice but I will tell you that I will never do this again.  It wasn't enough to eat even as a lunch.  So disappointed.   I was a fan."}
{"text":"Well finally I have my first one star review. Rand H. and myself had lunch here today  and all the food on the buffet was cold to lukewarm. When we told the owner that the food was cold , he told us we were wrong , and that the food was hot and just cooked. Well I know the difference between hot and cold and no one should ever question or call their customer a liar. He did not even check to see if the food was actually hot. (one star). I will not return."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The service isn't the best (usually only 1 or 2 employees constantly on the phone or running around), but we've always taken it to go. It's usually about 25-40 mins depending on how busy they are.

We've had the chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, masala dosa, garlic naan, and others. The naan can be hit or miss; tonight it was rather dry and crispy. The various sauces that come with the dosa are about average.

I've never had an issue with missing items in my to go order, but I was double check the bag for any take-out order.

I'll continue to go back, as they provide great value for the food/price points. If you don't want to drive to Scottsdale or up to Pinnacle Peak and pay 2x as much, then I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I go to this place regularly because i love biriyani.I never tried any other food except biriyani from here and i must say that the quality of biriyani is getting worse day by day.the rice they serves always half cooked .This weekend i had chicken special biriyani where the meats of that was not properly cooked too.and also it is good if you take out your food because the place is totally poor maintained."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their biryani. Am a regular for years. Recently found out that they make it fresh unlike few others in town that has a part of frozen /reheat component.
Small but a hidden gem. Highly recommended if you are a biryani lover."}
{"text":"As bad as it gets....biryani is just average...u can get better biryani in kabob palace or Chennai fusion in Chandler and Chennai chettinad or mayuri palace in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Absolutely don't get their takeout  order. Should have read reviews before going in. I got lamb curry and matter paneer. Lamb curry literally had 3 small piece of lamb and no more.  Even the matter paneer had like 4 or 5 very very small piece of paneer, rest was gravy. They should name their dishes lamb curry gravy and matter paneer gravy instead."}
{"text":"Just walked in sae the owner out front smoking i walked in he followed went right behind the counter without washing his hands. I walked out olus it smelled like urine"}
{"text":"The first time we went it was so good! The service was great, the food was some of the best I ever had. I went again and enjoyed the buffet at lunch - still a great experience. THEN we went last night and the food was awful! The service was non-existant and the worst part was the owner stood outside screaming at another man for over 10 minutes and then chain smoked for another 25. Did I mention he was our server? We had to refill our drinks several times and the other woman that was there just sat watching TV the whole time.
I was so excited that there was a good Indian restaurant in Chandler and now I'm not so sure.

It's very expensive too!"}
{"text":"One of the worthless place for Indian cuisine provides raw uncooked meat samosa that causes food poisoning never ever trust these guys. There behavior is filthy and worst than garbage. The owner was threatening us when we complained of the bad food. Eat food in this place at your own risk."}
{"text":"It's hard to find an Indian place that has a limited menu but does most items on that menu well .. Bawarchi is that place .. If you're looking for a typical Indian joint with a 5 page menu this isn't it .. In fact the smaller menu helps them to amp up the quality of heir food .. In my 3 weeks in AZ I have gotten take out twice and it's been on point both times"}

{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet. Yelp has $$ rating but the lunch buffet was priced as the same if not cheaper than others. The food and service were OUTSTANDING ! Extra stars for spices and flavor. They use more curry and spices than any other buffet I have been to  but NOT too much. Anyone will enjoy their huge variety of dishes. Would def. recommend to both experienced AND novice Indian food lovers!"}
{"text":"The worse quality food ever. They serving the preserved food. And place is also not hygienic at all. Need to improve their food quality."}
{"text":"Extremely slow waited almost 20 minutes for a to go order that was called in 15 minutes prior. Seem to be more interested in the iPad then making food not sure what's going on but I won't be coming back due to lack of customer service! Initially they said a couple minutes, now it's 20 minutes later!

I was just messaged by the owner stating I was rude for writing this review..... no what's rude is saying it will only be a couple minutes and taking a total of 20 minutes in the restaurant, don't lie to me about the time just be up front! Generally when you wait this long they throw in something or give you a coupon because it shouldn't take 35 minutes to make it sorry!"}

{"text":"Depends on Mastan's mood and our luck.."}
{"text":"This places is frequented by my colleagues a lot, so thought to try it once. I ordered bhindi fry, navratna kurma for take out. Received order very quickly. Food was very bad in taste. They had cucumber and egg plant in Navratna kurma, never had such a kurma. Gravy of kurma was taste less. Also for $8, I would expect a bigger portion of vegetable. Even bhindi fry was very bad, my wife hated it. When checked with friends, they suggested trying some hydrabadi chicken or biryani. The sauce served is awesome. Looks like this place is good for non vegetarians, but would not recommend this place for veggies. Last but not least, complimentary rice, which is standard with all Indian restaurant here, was half cooked. Can't believe all three dishes were tasteless."}
{"text":"I would prefer they raise prices and use high quality chicken. 
The spices and sauce are very very good, the meat needs an upgrade. 

I may just order the sauces and put it on a nice organic chicken. 

The people inside are very friendly and the place has a nice feel."}
{"text":"Average Indian food average service. The place isnt the cleanest. However the Andhra Chicken and biryani were above par."}
{"text":"Some of the dishes are ok, some are below average. Service is just ok. The kitchen looks very unsanitary and the dining room floor was dirty. I will no be going back. There are much better options for Indian food in the area."}
{"text":"If you are looking to dine in with some elegance this is not the place.  If you want to feast on possibly the best Indian food in the valley you have found the place!  Channa masala was delicious, garlic naan is fantastic and the chicken tikka masala is great too!  You cannot go wrong with this place but be prepared for a plan B as this place will sometimes randomly be closed.  Try to call ahead if you can."}
{"text":"Worst worst customer interaction. We order veg biryani and got EGG-Biryani. On same day Around 9:30pm I called them but no one  picked up. Next day I went and returned EGG biryani and got arrogant reply from owner. Very bad customer satisfaction. Me too offered biryani Money As a tip for rude behavior.  Please double check the order before taking parcel.... And hopefully you will not become victim of surprising parcel and rude customer interaction...."}
{"text":"I admit it. Biriyani is my weakness. I can fold for a good plate of spicy biriyani any day and Bawarchi serves just that. 
If you are there for the food, do not be fooled by the mediocre interiors although the setting is a bit homely for someone from south east asia. If you are a meat-lover go for the mutton biriyani or if a vegetarian, Vegan biriyani with lassi will soothe your craving.
I cannot vouch for the other items in the menu but I will surely visit the place often for I always walk out with a smile on my face :)"}
{"text":"Great takeout, love the chicken tikka marsala.  We're fans!"}
{"text":"I am not sure where the good reviews are coming from. But I will give a very honest opinion about the food. Below mediocre and above bad. That will be the best I may rate this place. 

Since when does Chicken Tikka Masala comprise of 2 cups sauce and 5 pieces of namesake chicken? Thats not even close to a definition of proper Indian Food. 

Ordered the Special Chicken Biryani as well (all to go order). 1 packet of food which was filled with Biryani essenced rice (yeah, they use essence as well.All of them do) with 8 pieces of color plastered tasteless stir fried chicken. Next comes the Naan. I wont spend too much time on that because its just not worth it when the main entree is so boring and bland. 

Trust me, if you have nothing else to eat, buy yourself a packet of ramen noodles and save yourself some money. I am not going to this eatery even if its the last restaurant on planet earth. No. Seriously....."}
{"text":"Best Indian Takeout in the North Phoenix / Scottsdale area. This place is almost a- hole-in-the-wall eatery. They have a good selection of South and North Indian food. Owner is friendly and quality of the food is decent. Quantity is huge and Price is reasonable for phoenix. 

They make up with what they they have any given day, so don't complain if they substitute meat with rice.. :-)  Best Dum Biryani in the region. 

Will definitely recommend if you know what you want and are not looking for service."}
{"text":"May be a bad day to get Chicken Tikka Kebab,Chicken kebabs looked like they have been sleeping for days in the freezer and then got a chance to get into the plate what they call Kebab.Heard the biriyani is good there ...but I think I am not in a mood to try my luck again..."}
{"text":"It's usually a good indicator if everyone behind the counter making your food is wearing a sari.  This is a very good, authentic indian food place.  I also like that it's a walk up counter (so you don't have to tip the waitstaff).   They have tables there but I usually get my order to go during lunch and it's always pretty fast.  I like the Dal with garlic nan or butter chicken.  It's nose running spicy but it fills me up and warms my soul..aaaaah."}
{"text":"The food isn't always fresh, but when it is, it is okay. The portions aren't that great. But the worst thing is the customer service. I was getting food to go and asked for a napkin, the woman said \"we are out of napkins\". I just looked at her in disbelief. She sighed, turned around and went into the back. Returned with a new pack of napkins, opened them in front of my eyes and handed me a couple. Nice."}
{"text":"The best place for Chicken Dum biryani. Other non-veg dishes are good. Menu is small but covers most of the basic dishes. 

Very cheap also. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"In Short :
THE BEST Hyderabadi Biryani(s) (Chicken Dum, Sp. Chicken, Goat and Fish) in Phoenix.
Don't even bother about the rest of the Menu. :)

Details :
One of my hot spots to have Biryani during my stay (2012-2013) in Phoenix.
Pros :
Very Tasty authentic Hyderabad Style Dum Biryani(s).
I would also recommend the Spicy Andhra Chicken Curry with Garlic Naan.

Cons :
It's a poorly Maintained spot. Zero points to Ambiance.
Menu is very limited to a few dishes.
The owner is short tempered. Be careful and don't poke him. Lol.
Packing is poor, many times they miss packing the sides. 
Pay, wait and eat.

3 starts coz a Restaurant cannot be rated 5 Start just on one Menu Item. :D"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service I've seen at a restaurant.  The place doesn't seat large groups and from the time we entered, the owner was extremely rude to us. He was pissed that we were putting the tables together to seat all of us together. We were literally scared to ask him for simple things like cups for water and plates (which were low quality Styrofoam) as he was snapping at us. 

We were there mainly for the biriyani and it was   mediocre at best. The chicken pieces in the special biriyani were just colored chicken tikka pieces which tasted so weird. When we ordered the chicken 65, we were again served the same pieces of tikka (chicken 65 is supposed to be deep fried). The rice in the biriyani was the only saving grace. The mango lassi was watery and tasted more like milk than yogurt, the pakoras were dripping with oil and raw inside. 

The food quality and general cleanliness of the restaurant was below standards. But above all, the service was incredibly poor. They refused to provide an itemized bill and when we insisted, he took 20 mins to print one. Definitely wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"should be rated as 0.  worst place to eat in phoenix. worst indian food. raw and uncooked. stinking meat. rotten meat served. will cause food poisoning.  never eat in this place. if you eat, eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Great food.  I was in from out of town and I've recently become a vegetarian.  They had a great selection of Indian food for me and my carnivore friend to chose from. I highly recommend this place and will come here again the next time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"POOR QUALITY
Worst Dum Biryani I ever had in my life.Its like a street side food.Don't waste your money and time.There are more restaurants which serve u better Biryani than this. Maintanence is poor."}
{"text":"So happy to see another Indian place pop up by my house!

Bawarchi is a no-frills, very casual, authentic little Indian restaurant. Menu is small but covers most of the basics.

We had naan, aloo gobi, palak paneer, and my hubs had a chicken curry. The aloo gobi was not my favorite. I feel it was mostly onions with very little cauliflower and potatoes. It wasn't bad... but I have had better at most other Indian restaurants. The naan was very good. So was the palak paneer- very yummy. Creamy, spicy, perfect. My husband really liked his chicken dish. 

I like that the entrees came with a very generous serving of rice. Some Indian places either make you pay extra for rice or only give you a little bit.

I am disappointed that they recently raised their prices on everything. The picture of the menu you see on Yelp is not accurate. In fact the menu they gave us with our order had the prices crossed out and the raised prices written in. Classy. But the prices are still excellent and a MUCH better value than other local Indian restaurants. 

We will be back. Again and again and again...."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken korma extra spicy with garlic naan. The korma was tasty but wasn't as spicy as I had requested. Despite my informing Bawarchi that I wanted extra spicy and even asked upon pick up if it was spicy was met with a so-so response regarding a spiciness. I'm not very happy with this visit unfortunately which is sad because that usually get my food right."}
{"text":"Found a replacement place for Biryani very near to this restaurant opened Pastries N Chaat which serves alot better food than Bawarchi atleast he wont lie saying Biryani is fresh and serve stale food...."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up quick Indian food in the North Valley!  My wife and I stopped by here last night after reading the other good reviews on yelp, seeing the great prices on the menu, and feeling like watching a movie at home with good food. We ordered Chana Masal, Aaloo Gobi, and Vegatable Biryani. All three had excellent flavor and spices.  The spice level is pretty high, which is fine by us but if you are not into heat you may want ask if they can tone it down. The Biryani came in a bag, which was new to me but I wonder if that might be typical of take away curry in India and Europe.  Although I've never been to India, this food seemed more authentic than other restaurant in the valley. Keeping that in mind, you may want to watch for spice pods, curry leaves and whole chillies in the dishes, as the food is less processed than you may be use to.  It is good to have this new place for Indian, which offers great veggie options and meat options as well. Great prices with quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"My friends have taken me to good biryani places so for some reason I don't think this was the best biryani. BUT I don't know if what I've had was DUM biryani or not.  Tried the chicken one and it didn't have the flavor I though. Maybe all those times it wasn't truly authentic or from a dif region?  They give you a lot of rice though.  Not a whole lot if chicken but you'll find this under all the rice. 
Had the chicken tikka masala too and liked the flavor of the sauce. 
Ordered two mango lassis. The first one came out about 5 minutes after we got our food (not before). The second one came out about 5 minutes after that one.  The guy told me the lady was making them in the back.  It was a bit strange on the timing but tells me that there was literally one person in the back doing the main cooking.  

Cleanliness: I am by no means a germ-a-phobe and rarely bothered by how a place looks but there was something about this place that didnt sit right with me.  Not sure what but I noticed it. I thought the reviews were over reacting but for once there is some legitimacy. Thankfully I just let it pass.  
I will warn you though that the owner or guy at the counter is not so willing to give up his to-go containers. I asked for a second container to replace the sauce container we had bc it had gotten really dirty. The guy started pointing to the container and muttered something before finally giving it to me. Funny. 
Despite all this I will be back.  There are some things on the menu that seemed more local to the region that I don't see at other places so would be great to try them."}
{"text":"no frills ricey indian. meh. great spot for that sweet mango yogurt drink. wishing they were still in tempe; magic lost since the move up here.

#stingy on the meat. if they run out, they'll give you extra rice. WHAT?!
#i'm not an expert on indian, but that rice is soggy for my taste.
my indian friends say it must cook for hours to absorb the flavor, but they also say it should not be mushy like that.

--but that mango yogurt drink is a mean, sweet, beautiful thing. go for it.

#wishing that when you ask for a 20 on the 1-5 spiciness scale, that they'd give it a bit more effort."}
{"text":"Took mutton Biriyani, rice is good but the meat is stinking, got vomiting."}
{"text":"What do you tell a kid who's got two A's and one C in a semester? You can't commend him for his performance nor can you give him grief for performing badly; after all two A's do count, don't they? And this is what I thought when I got down to review the Bawarchi Indian Cuisine. On one hand, this restaurant provides the most authentic Andhra/Hyderabad food I've ever eaten to date in the Phoenix area. On the other hand, there are things like cleanliness, service, quality etc. (you get the point) which matter, and it is here that this place falters and it falters badly. But the food, especially the biryani and Andhra chicken curry or the lamb chops are very good and very true to their taste. I can't comment on vegetarian food but I believe it won't be very off. So if you are looking for some real authentic Andhra/Hyderabad food, then I think you should head to this place, but then for the reasons mentioned above, you shouldn't hesitate to take a carry out."}
{"text":"It's not your typical restaurant with great ambience, very basic seating has a good variety. I would recommend the chicken dum Biriyani and Chicken special Biriyani preferably for pickup.
It comes with Raita(yogurt with onions and cucumber) and some kind of gravy(I'm not sure what it is) guess it's Salan (gravy of peanuts,chilli,has a bunch of other spices) generally served with Dum Biriyani.

As my search for Dum Biriyani continues in AZ,this place scores better than most.The Biriyani is not very spicy on the palate and will not give you a hard time the next morning."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. The place isn't very clean. The tables are super wobbly and the ceiling was leaking water. Could use a good cleaning and some repairs. Ordered the chicken masala and rice. The rice was good, the chicken was tender, the sauce was not a flavor I've had before when eating Indian food elsewhere. The dessert donuts and bread pudding were not edible, all grease and no flavor. Overall, I likely won't be back to this place."}
{"text":"The food is great but the staff lacks cleaning standers and the place over all needs some cleaning. The bathroom was really dirty and you can see dry urine on the toilet seat. I saw one of the ladies cleaning it before i left but she went straight to the kitchen and started preparing food without washing her hands. But like i said, the food is really delicious and the only problem is how dirty it is."}
{"text":"This place is such a rare find! Not the fanciest place but if you want to feel like you're home, come here and enjoy the amazing food. Unfortunately, I landed in Phoenix late and I was hungry/craving naan bread. This place was closed but when we pulled up the owner greeted us and we all know how you can tell when they want you in or no! Lol. Well it didn't seem to bother him that we came after closing hours. He said the tandoori was off so he can't make the bread but he had beryani. We settled with the beryani and I was kinda bummed out but was grateful he even agreed to make us any food. We stepped out for a few minutes and we came back, the gentleman, aka owner, was making us the bread. How sweet is that ? He didn't have to and didn't have any pressure to do so. It's so kind of him. I tell you something, if you go order more than what you need of the naan cz its irresistible! Definitely coming back tomorrow for lunch !!"}
{"text":"People pick up more than eating here.
It isn't a fine dining restaurant but the taste of biriyani is very authentic."}
{"text":"Not at all clean,  very small place.  I mostly go to this place because of not many options for Indian food and I mostly get to-go food. The price on menu is different and the one they charge is different. Happened many times,  and when I asked once , I was told the menu prices are yet to be changed."}
{"text":"Had mysore bonda today at this place..it was a proper one, taste was spot on. Served with 2 types chutneys. Peanut chutney would have been the best combination. Nevertheless, it was a tasty snack."}
{"text":"Went over for dinner after reading all the reviews. So here goes:

MENU
Although are a reasonable number of items on the menu, not all of them were available this evening.

FOOD
We ordered, Goat Dum Biryani, Bagaray Baigan, Masala Dosa, Tandoori Chicken, Goat Sheesh Kabab, Plain Naan, Garlic Naan and Onion Naan.
Masala Dosa was nice, the accompanying chutnies and sambar were pretty good.
Bagaray Baigan was nice.
Goat Dum Biryani was nice.
Tandoori Chicken a little dryer than I like but tasted good
Naans were good.(could have been cooked a tad more but good)
The raita was nice.
Goat Sheesh Kabab was not a flavor I enjoyed.

RESTAURANT AND DINING AREA
It was not a filthy dirty place that some others described. It would definitely benefit from better cleaning and maintenance and a fresher look.

This is a fast food style (not fast food) place where we order at the counter and then pick the order when its ready. We throw away our own trash.

SERVICE  
Friendly people, took our orders, they were helpful and attentive.   

I would go back."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service - love their spices - Chicken Tikka Masala always great - I ask for extra chicken. Not a great eat-in but super for pickup if you live close by."}
{"text":"Its supposed to be the best biryani around but I have nothing good to say.It's the worst I have had. Just thinking about the chicken biryani makes me want to throw up . The tandoori kebabs we ordered were pathetic and literally uncooked. I had to throw away the entire tandoori chicken .Hate the food here. I would rather take time and make biryani myself and eat hereafter than coming to this place . Contrary to what ppl say service here is so much better than the food."}
{"text":"Goat was not at all cooked and I threw five goat biryani pieces, none of them were cooked. Rice wasn't also good. Service is too bad. If you want to maintain good health be out of this."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. Authentic Indian food and a great price. The employees are very friendly and the food is delicious. So far I've tried the Lamb Palak and Chicken Koorma. I can't decide which was more delicious. I see some of the reviews about cleanliness but it's as clean as any other fast food. And delicious!"}
{"text":"Consistently good flavors, tried many items on the menu and enjoyed all of them. Ambiance is nothing to brag about (hence the loss of a star), great for take-out. Food from here is a staple in our house!"}
{"text":"Biryani tastes great here. Just what I crave for.  Best Biryani in town so far. Tried in multiple Biryani places in town over last couple of years and I always come back to this place for Biryani. Wish they have a branch in western part of Phoenix"}
{"text":"FILTHY DIRTY SHAME!
This place won't make it on good food only. This is the filthiest restaurant I've seen in many years. I've been three times, and the filth is no fluke, it's a standard here. Trash is overflowing, food served on filthy food trays, dried food and crumbs on tables that only need to be wiped. Filthy, dried food remains in a tub above the trash that also overflows. Nothing is ever wiped down, trash on the floor, mold on the fountain nozzles. Last visit, they were out of ICE. OUT OF ICE? 

All this filth, and the guy that runs the register is rude and is either eating at the register, standing with his hands in his pockets, or sitting at a table where his laptop is a fixed feature. I think if they replaced this guy with someone that will do the job, they could fix a lot of their problems. I've never seen him make an effort other than take an order, which he has trouble getting right as I've noticed people get food they did not order.

Their food is terrific, but this place will eventually be shut down by the health department. They've received bad reports in the past and made no effort to improve.

It's a real shame, this place could be so great, so easily. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty, dirty.  I can't understand why people tolerate this sort of messy place.  Some food items were rather good - Dosa in particular, but the majority of the ones we had were extremely oily compared to other places for the same dishes & apps.  Their prices really aren't much cheaper than full service places either, and it's hard to see why it is worth the savings."}
{"text":"Ok for starters, I like this joint as they filled the void for a decent Indian Carry out joint in town. I do not like the exorbitant prices they charge though. You could add a dollar to most of their menu items and that would be the lunch buffet price at other joints around town. I tried their Goat biriyani and was surprised at the amount of fat that was in the food. If you are looking to clog your arteries, go ahead and try the mutton biriyani here.  Surprisingly they had a better quality when I visited the place around their launch period. Like most Indian restaurants in the Valley, the quality seems to have deteriorated over time."}
