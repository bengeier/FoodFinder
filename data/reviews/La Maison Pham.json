{"text":"Go here for lunch quite often. Truth is there isn't much around.  The food (vietnamese influenced) is tasty, and the portions are reasonable.  It is also very reasonable.  BYOB.  Moreover, prices are very reasonable and service is quick most of the time, which is important for lunch.  Not haute gastronomy but for the price it deserves a 4 stars"}
{"text":"Meilleure qualité prix ! choix numéro un a Laval-des-rapides !  Mon amie et moi allons toujours manger la bas, pour de bien simples raisons :  - Un aquarium géant orne l'entrée, et c'est cute. - Les madames 'pham' sont vraiment sweet - Le menu est sur ton napperon et il n'y a presque pas de fautes dessus - Les ananas frits !!!  - Les prix sont ridicules pour la quantité (11$ une ÉNORME assiette) - C'est apportez-votre-vin et il y a un dépanneur la porte a coté  Je vous le dit , plaisir garanti et estomac assouvi."}
{"text":"La Maison Pham is a Vietnamese styled resto that I feel many people can find themselves enjoying a quick lunch in. Service is quick and the price is somewhat decent. We were in and out within 30 minutes... which is awesome.   Sadly, no Bahn Mi was on the menu!  I went with their Combo C which consisted of grilled chicken/beef with an imperial roll and a side portion of salad/rice for $13. Overall, the meal was good but nothing really stood out for me that left me craving for more. I could have the same meal elsewhere for a few bucks less with about the same satisfaction enjoyed by the meal.  Overall I rate the place 3 solid stars. Maybe another visit one day will allow me to change my opinion."}
