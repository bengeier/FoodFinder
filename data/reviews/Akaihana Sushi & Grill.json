{"text":"Great food and service. Always consistent with the quality. My must haves are the cucumber salad and fried shrimp spring rolls. The blue flame and rainbow roll are really good. And the red bean ice cream is SO good! And the happy hour deals are great."}
{"text":"After having our first date at Akai Hana Sushi we were amazingly pleased with our service and the quality of our food.  Being creatures of habit we chose to revisit the restaurant for our Anniversary yesterday and the service was much less than what we had come to expect from Akai Hana.  Our server, Kevin, was polite and forgot to bring us plates, napkins and our drink refills.  After canceling our second round of beverages we left.  I attempted to call and speak with a manager or owner and was hung up on.  I am sad to say that we will not be revisiting the location of our FIRST DATE and truly hope they can work out the details to make their restaurant as good as it was before."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for about 15 years. They just keep getting better and better and with this new remodel it has opened it up so much and I love it!  Their food is always fresh, they are always adding new menu items but rest assured the old ones are still there and if they aren't, they will make it for you anyway! Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Great happy hour! Fast service even when busy! Ask for there white sesame salad dressing to dip your sushi in! Hooked! Love this place :) only thing is it gets a little loud when it's a little busy but it's worth it. For the 4pm-close happy hour it's a great time to try new rolls, huge menu!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and eat lunch here on a semi-weekly basis. For the price the sushi is quite good. They have a \"happy hour\" menu for lunch with great prices on good rolls. Their specialty rolls are excellent and have some interesting combinations.  The building Mr. Sushi is in screams \"hole in the wall\" but don't be put off by it.  Service speed can be a bit spotty when it is busy but the wait is worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Picked up food here today for my moms birthday.  We loved it.  Got the fried veggies, edamame, rice, salad, and avocado sushi   An abundance of food for a great price. Literally ate my heart out and I'm about to take an amazing nap. Definitely a bang for your buck for happy hour 11am-2pm"}
{"text":"I recently took a position with a company close to Akaihana and decided to check it out for lunch.   What I found was an interior under moderate renovation which left the ambiance rather concerning.  With bare walls and raw sheet rock I considered cleanliness.  I sat at the bar and received moderately hasty service during a busy lunch rush.  What I ordered:  Cucumber salad, which was clunky and entirely too much for an appetizer salad.  It resembled veggie spaghetti which was difficult to eat without worry.  The flavor was flat.  Fresh Oysters, delightful yet small.  Both appetizers were served AFTER my Nigiri order of Unagi, Salmon and Yellowtail.  All 3 orders of Nigiri were delicate and fresh.  Exactly what you would expect from raw fish albeit they were served on WARM sushi rice.   Overall, the potential for a great experience is there!  Will I return, yes!   Next up: Hamachi Kama ( which is another of my gauges of Great Japanese cuisine.) Cost out the door for lunch with tea- $30.00 - but I did splurge!"}
{"text":"Average sushi here, pretty good lunch specials.  Nothing to write home about but if you are hungry and in the area, its a decent meal.  Prices are mid to high for sushi.  Come in, eat, get out..."}
{"text":"Awesome specials and family friendly. Very busy place! Tempura and wasabi salad dressing were delightful. Reasonable prices and great dinner specials. We'll be back soon.   Delightful dinner."}
{"text":"My daughter's friends have been raving about this place and I have been meaning to check it out, but I first started eating sushi here in Phoenix at Takamatsu, so I was kind of a snob.  Let me tell you, I am no longer snobbish!  We went for HH and since I had a large lunch, I wasn't too terribly hungry.  I decided to try their Pacific Oysters (@ 3 for $6.00) pretty good deal.  I had only been used to East Coast Oysters so I had nothing to compare to.  If you are used to East Coast Oysters, go to Akaihana anytime and try their Pacific Oysters.  Beware though, 1 oyster is as big as your face!!!  Definitely worth the 3 for $6.00. Each oyster was crisp, clean and meaty!  Very sweet and the mignionette sauce was divine!!!  I ordered a 1/2 dozen, which was by far too much, but I happily ate them anyway and just didn't have to have dinner.  The sake bomber price was ok but at Stingray Sushi it is cheaper (by $2.00).  I am going to go back  and try their sushi during happy hour and hope to come away pleasantly surprised!!!"}
{"text":"Akaihana is one of my favorite go-to restaurants for date night! The service is always good and the restaurant has a great mom-and-pop vibe. There are pictures of customers covering the walls; they're pictures that were taken when the customers celebrated a special occasion at the restaurant (think birthdays, anniversaries, etc.) My favorite menu items are the blue flame and jalapeño poppers, so delicious! I've taken my family to the restaurant as well and my sister ordered a bowl of noodles, she loved it! I recommend going during happy hour and at lunch time to get the most out of your experience. I cannot recommend Akaihana enough!"}
{"text":"If you like to save money, the happy hour prices at Akaihana also simply known as \"Mr. Sushi\" are ridiculously cheap. The quality of food and the atmosphere is homely when entering the restaurant.   There are different varieties of sushies available to all the sushi lovers. This place is great for all the college students who live nearby. It's a great access to get away from campus and have lunch with your peers."}
{"text":"Wonderful remodel, food is still unbelievable the best in the valley, If you looking for great sushi come here"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by 2 friends when it was called Mr. Sushi.  My wife and I met up with another couple here for dinner this week.  When we walked in, the person working the host/hostess booth asked one of the server's to seat us and she responded with attitude.  This pretty much set the tone for the rest of the evening.  1.  Wife's beverage didn't make it out until after 20 minutes of being seated and after 3 requests.  2.  It was hit or miss with some of the rolls we ordered.  The California Roll fell apart when trying to eat it with chop sticks.  The crab mix tasted off.  3.  Server didn't clear the table and we sat with finished plates cluttering our table until we paid our bill.  4.  One of our rolls was forgotten about and was brought out to us when everyone finished their sushi and entrees.  Some positives of Akaihana is that the quantity of sushi was plentiful and the price was very reasonable.  Some of the other staff seemed friendly but unfortunately we drew the short straw.  My wife doesn't want to have anything to do with the place but I'm willing to give it another shot sometime down the road."}
{"text":"Great sushi in an odd and easy to miss location. Better than most places in town, reasonably priced and always consistent. Standouts include the crazy roll, baked scallop dynamite rolls and many of the others on both the extensive sushi menu and large Japanese Menu. I consistently to come here out of my way instead of the \"fancier\" places simply because their food is better."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious. The only problem is the service. It was just two of us and we ordered the lobster tempura and a bowl or ramen. It took forever for our food to come out and it was sorta sad that once food did come out it was only one order. By the time my boyfriend finished his food and awhile after the other order came. Maybe next time I go it will be better and I can give it a better review. But as I said its food is 5 star quality. It was just the service and time that has me rating it 3 stars"}
{"text":"This a family favorite since 2010. Love the blue flame and tootsie roll! The service is wonderful and the staff are very accomodating."}
{"text":"Always great food and service! They also have a good deal on rolls for Happy Hour. Also known as \"Mr Sushi\" is defintley my favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke. My fiancé ordered 4 rolls on the happy hour menu, and I ordered 2 on the regular menu. His rolls were brought out one by one over the course of an hour, and it took over an hour for me to get my first roll. The service is horrific and the sushi is average at best. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Best in Phoenix and it's not even close.  Location leaves a bit to be desired but the food is always excellent, variety unmatched."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Sushi here. Went for happy hour. Spicy Tuna Roll, California Roll and the Fried Salmon Roll my favorites"}
{"text":"Terrible experience!! I went to Akaihana Sushi this afternoon with couple of friends. It started off terribly when the server didn't even give us the menus and we had to bring them ourselves. Later after we ordered, our starters didn't come until after 40 minutes and we were not given any plates or bowls to eat on. After another hour two rolls of sushi were served. Among three of us it wasn't a lot of food and we were patiently waiting for our order. After 2 hours of waiting the server came with the check not even mentioning our food that was never served. We decided not to wait any longer, pay for what we ate and cancel the rest of the order. It took another 30 minutes for the waitress to split the check in between three of us and figure out the change. It was a big waste of our afternoon- 2.5 hours and still hungry. But the best is at the end! I came home and checked my bank account and I was charged $25 more than what I was billed for!! Tomorrow I have to go and argue with them again. I will not be revisiting that place ever again. I strongly DO NOT recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I found out about  this place from a friend and cant stop going! The cucumber salad is so delicious and i cant find it anywhere else. They have all sorts of yummy rolls:) My personal favorite is the Crazy roll and the Forrest Gump roll."}
{"text":"We went here today for happy hour and was disappointed.   We ordered gyoza, teriyaki chicken, spicy chicken, ramen, baked scallops roll and salmon skin roll.  Gyoza and spicy chicken were the saving grace for me and the family. I will definitely come back just for the spicy chicken.  Teriyaki was nothing special. The ramen, which supposed to have pork and veggies but I only found 2 thin pieces of pork. The worst part was that the broth was barely warm and lacked flavor.   The salmon skin roll was ok. It was falling apart! The baked scallop roll was just mostly imitation crab with mayo and some scallops. The baked scallop roll took about 15-20 mins before we got it.  Anyway, the service was ok, the food was so disappointing especially for the price."}
{"text":"Okay so this is my second time calling for a takeout and they still SCREW UP MY ORDER.  It's so annoying how I called and told them to please not mess up my order for the second time and they did. I called at 3pm to have it ready by 5pm! This is ridiculous, and their staff has an attitude & clearly doesn't know how to do their job. The sushi is good though, just crappy service!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 20 years as my favorite sushi spot in the phoenix metropolitian arra. Since the remodel and expansion it has gone down hill. Unless you get Sean or David at the bar. I just took 8 friends from out of town and was very disappointed. They need better table service and management."}
{"text":"This is an updated review for me. Lately, I have found the experience at Akaihana to be inconsistent. Sometimes it's great, other times, it's poor.   In general, service is better at the bar (and you still may wait there awhile, too). --All too often one must flag down a waitress or waiter for things from the kitchen. Of late, the wait staff don't look towards the diners ---you really have to wave and call out. If you just wave, they will walk past you. --  Sushi/sashimi presentation varies per chef. The younger male chef is consistently more careful and artful with his creations. The older male chef can be careless at times --creating messy and disappointing dishes.  Sometimes the same sauces seem to taste better than at other times. I had a poorer \"taste\" experience on the weekend compared to during the week. Maybe I got the dregs of the sauce --when workers were too busy to make a fresh batch...  All in all, I'm ready to explore new options."}
{"text":"Don't order the AZ Cards Roll. It didn't come out as advertised and they were unwilling to make any resolutions except a lot of conflicting excuses. Rice and ginger were dry too. Very disappointed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been going her off and on for abour 10 years myself, mostly because it's 2 miles from my front door. What can I say? My overall take on this place is it's a bit pricey for what they deliver, the service is mediocre to good, the chefs only semi-helpful. Food quality generally quite good, although I have noted some sloppy preparation lately. I've taken to ordering the catering special Samurai Platter lately to go, 7 rolls for $35. This is probably their best value, but last time the rolls fell apart and the tuna was kind of mushy. Still, they have the best caterpillar roll I've ever had. Guess I'd recommend this one with some cautions."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect. Clean,fast delicious. Extremely satisfied everytime. All fish fresh and sweet. Ive been going here for years and not once left hungry or not satisfied. Better than sex"}
{"text":"So, I was a little nervous about trying a Sushi place in AZ. I wasn't sure how fresh fish could be since the state is mostly desert...  However, I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. I had read a lot of the previous reviews including some really horrible ones, but decided that those seemed few and far between.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the slow service. All the servers were very friendly and helpful, but it was a little slow to get just about anything.  We ordered shumai appitizer, miso soup and four rolls. The Blue Flame roll was my husbands favorite, its fried, but lightly so it doesn't have a lot of crunch which we both really enjoyed. We also ordered a dragon roll, Jan roll and baked scallop roll. All the rolls were good, fresh and presented well. And considering the price, its a great value.  I will definitely eat here again next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that the sushi here was wonderful! That's the only reason it gets four stars. You could tell the wait staff was working their butts off but there were definitely NOT enough of them. We sat at the sushi bar as there were no tables available. A waitress took our drink orders and we asked for a regular dinner menu as one of us was not eating sushi. Not once did anyone come back to take the order, refill drinks etc. Phone was ringing off the hook with no one answering. We will definitely eat here again but might just get food to go. I've worked in the F&B industry for years so I understand how crazy things can get but they definitely need a manager, hostess and maybe a busser or two to help with the dinner rush. Doesn't seem like they are handling the expansion very well."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had here in the states. I have been by this wonderful spot many times and wondered if the what turned out to be excellent Japanese cuisine was true."}
{"text":"Some friends took me here recently and I couldn't thank them enough. We got their right when it opened and had an attentive server who checked up on us after every dish was brought out. We spent a lot of time deciding what to order and ended up ordering more. Now, even with the awesome deals for happy hour, we still spent quite a lot for four people. Definitely some of the best authentic sushi in the area with a peaceful atmosphere that you can really enjoy with some great friends."}
{"text":"Normally this place is the best sushi in town, but I'm guessing the new remodel means crappier sushi, no sushi, and lack of quality. Hopefully they can go back to the older ways of caring about special orders"}
{"text":"Darkly tucked into a corner of the strip mall, this is a really great place once you find it.  Affordable, very good flavor, large rolls.  You get much more than you pay for here.  We had the Las Vegas roll, Spicy Tuna, and Six Shooter.  All were very good.  We would return any time.  My only suggestion is to light up the sign so it is easier to find.  We almost gave up before seeing the \"OPEN\" sign.  VERY happy that we stopped by."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. This place has delicious sushi.  The rolls and hand rolls are a really good size.  I liked the salmon, albacore and octopus, which I always get. Also the spicy tuna and salmon skin hand rolls were very good.  I did order the Baja roll but found out that I don't like garlic ponzu sauce. If you are a cheesecake lover I HIGHLY recommend having their deep fried cheesecake. I had never had cheesecake like that. It was Awesome!!!! I will definitely go back! Love!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good sushi, pay attention to the negative reviews.  I should have because everything they said was accurate.   Our food took 45 minutes to arrive for three rolls and a noodle soup.   We had: Manhattan Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Sunset Roll and the Nabeyaki Udon.   Overall the food is not good. Fairly bland, slightly hard rice that is the wrong kind of sticky.  The salmon is not pink, but that odd light orange color of not so good fish. The rolls are haphazardly rolled, the interior shape squashed and oblong.  Inconsistent piece by piece.  I will not return.  It was not worth the time or money.   If you want decent sushi check out Yen.    Sunset Roll: The fish is sliced messy, no care for details was taken, and placed over the roll in a sloppy hastened manner. The lemon that is placed on top also inconsistently cut, randomly sized and shaped.  The rind was left on the lemon.  Unpleasant. The salmon as I mentioned above, was not good.   Manhattan Roll:  Was only passable because the shrimp was deep fried and it had sauces with flavor. Same rice and shape problems.   Spicy Tuna:  not good.  The tuna was too light a shade of pink. Bland in flavor, and made too spicy to make up for lack of taste.  Shape and rice problems.   Udon: Bland, flavorless. Needed basic things like salt. Was not hot, just somewhat warm upon arrival. The tempura shrimp accompanying it was also bland.   Odd dirty drawings of sushi rolls on the walls drawn using markers and crayons. I thought they were children's drawings at first."}
{"text":"My husband and I are not necessarily sushi people, but we tried the sushi rolls here and they were delicious. Not realizing how much food we were ordering, we got the blue flame, Philadelphia and Tokyo rolls along with Beef Tataki. It was way too much food for 2 people. It was all excellent, especially the Beef Tataki.   We came on our lunch break, and the place was busy, but wait times were reasonable. Service was very friendly. I appreciated the fact that the waitstaff didn't seem territorial at all. If we needed a refill and a server was passing, they just offered a refill. It's refreshing compared to restaurants where your one and only server is overloaded and can't give you the attention you need.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"After 4 years in the valley, I finally have a go-to sushi place. This place was clean and modern with fast service. I ordered two happy hour rolls, and two specialty rolls. They were all tasty and huge! I can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Best Hamachi Kama in town. The sushi is delicious.  And the service is exceptional. That's why this is favorite sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in town. Big tasty sushi rolls for a very reasonable price. The renovated the place a year or two ago so the ambience is good too. I highly recommend this and the goodyear locations."}
{"text":"Best sushi rolls ever. I have tried many rolls here.  All are fresh and delicious but my favorites are the blue flame roll and the tropicana roll. This is a true hidden gem. They have a happy hour menu that is fantastic. I believe happy hour is twice a day. I always get seated right away, but its always a bit busy. I like to see that so I know fish is fresh. The staff is always nice and friendly. Definitely don't go to the chain sushi restaurants anymore. I pay half the price and get fresher sushi here with a smile."}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  The sushi menu was more than adequate and the rest of the menu options were great.  We came here on a Wed night around 6:15 PM, just missing happy hour.  The place was busy, but the service was still descent.  We ordered two salmon-based rolls (Philadelphia and Las Vegas rolls) and the teriyaki chicken dinner (which was pretty big portion of chicken and a heaping serving of salad).  Great tasting food!  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Not one of those loud trendy sushi houses! A hidden gem tucked into an unlikely area. I am a lover of great Japanese food and finding one seems to be a difficult undertaking in the Phoenix area. Akaihana's food is fantastic and reasonably priced. I love to get the Mr. Sushi Bento for lunch. It has everything you could ask for in a bento (including a very fresh price of sashimi tuna) and the quality of the meat is great. This place is not fancy, and you won't be bombarded with the standard high-volume techno drumbeats that most sushi places seem to have; much more traditional here. two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It has become \"our place\" for date night. We have dinned here many times and I've never been let down. Delicious no matter what we get, good happy hour and a nice overall vibe in this cozy restaurant. Our service is always exceptional , receiving warm hellos and goodbyes . If you haven't givin it a try you are missing out!"}
{"text":"If your hungry, don't go , the service is slow and we had to walk out and go to el pollo loco.  This review isn't even worth writing"}
{"text":"I've been to many sushi places over the years but akai Hana is by far the best in the valley. Their sushi is always fresh and have the best happy hour with the most friendly staff. Thanks Sean for always making our visit a great one!!"}
{"text":"This place has been very solid for many years. It is our neighborhood secret. The food is really good and prices are low compared to other sushi restaurants. If you know your sushi, you will like this place. The tuna is always, consistently top quality. My wife is Japanese and she really likes this place. It can get really busy and crowded if you go at the wrong time. If so you will have to wait at times but I always call to see how busy it is and get reservations. Some of the best sushi in Phoenix and that is why it is often crowded. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is yummy and we come here often. I gave it 5 stars, but I wanted to give them a 10. We always have the fried California roll and teriyaki chicken. The chicken is very good! The best part is that it is very affordable and family friendly."}
{"text":"Small shop that blew the expectations I had through the roof. The sushi nd everything else is amazing and such a great price !!"}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi person by no means. However the slightly fried sushi is my favorite because i can eat it and not feel like its just raw fish. The happy hour has some awesome prices. Beer starting at 3.50 even for some of their imports."}
{"text":"Only sushi place we're found in Phoenix that gets repeat business from us. Most are awful, some are decent, but this place is good!  Polite, quick service and tasty sushi! Their appetizers and entrees are also pretty good, though we usually come for the sushi. There are almost too many sushi options, we're slowly working through them.   Do yourself a favor, get the \"Nixon Roll\". :D"}
{"text":"I will no longer dining in or picking up take-out from here. The food quality and service is no longer consistent.  Against my better judgement I did try again silly me don't even think about trying the lobster tempura roll. You wont any lobster literally a spec. This place also thinks putting brown avocado in rolls is ok, I find it disgusting!"}
{"text":"Food was good, only reason why not 5 star servers took a while to take order, bring food, refills, and forgot a sushi we ordered. Liked there was no wait time arrived around 3pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I'm here once a week.  The staff is great.  The food is better!  Spicy Tuna Cracker app is a winner. Baked scallop roll is a must have.  They have so many different rolls, there is something for everyone. Rice free, low-carb options available as well. ooh!  Get the jalapeno popper app. It's stuffed with crab. Soooo good."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!!!! I have been coming to this sushi joint for 10 years, the name has changed, but the food has remained AWESOME!!!! Sean & Chris really know how to throw down the SUSHI!!!! I absolutely love their HH and the DRAGON salad is SUBLIME!!! When I think sushi, this is the first place I think of!!!!"}
{"text":"Odd location with good food. Pretty much in an empty shopping mall next to I-17. We had a mix of rolls and nigiri.  Albacore: large pieces and fresh  Salmon: large pieces and fresh  Todd Roll: a large amount of spicy tuna on top of a tempura eggpant chip. Quite tasty, but quite a bit of tuna on top.   Lobster Tempura Roll: good sized pieces of lobster. The whole thing is deep fried. Perhaps not your thing  Spicy Yellowtail Roll: a subtle sweetness to it. Definitely worth an order  N*Joy"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. I come here with my family and friends. They are always busy but have fret quality sushi. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This it's my favorite sushi place in the valley. The staff is super friendly and they serve you quickly with a smile ."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing sushi experience! The lobster (dynamite or not) is to die for, the Crazy roll is just as good. And their Las Vegas roll is unlike any I ever taste, its spicy jalapenos, spicy sauce, Verde sauce and all. Ive been craving their delicious goodness since I had it a few days ago. The staff caters to your every need and are as friendly as could be, the patrons that hangout here are equally as friendly. Overall the best experience Ive had in a while, though my heart will always be with Sakana (Ahwatukee)."}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi Restaurant in Phoenix . The manager Mr. Starve Ogawa Sushi is not looks like Japanese, but he is the Japanese real man of Sushi."}
{"text":"You know those sushi places in strip malls which are the local favorites where you walk in and the sushi chef and his assistant kind of say hello in Japanese but are really half-hearted in their salutations and not all that excited to be there but you sit up at the bar anyway and look at  the options and decide for the sushi special and then you wait a while and you get your miso soup which is a very lazy version of miso soup indeed and then get your sushi order and you proceed to eat a plattter full of sushi but within 30 seconds of finishing you don't remember how anything tasted which is kind of strange and the surly college-student waiter gives you your bill and you put in your credit card but the waiter then decides to ignore you for 10 minutes until the sushi chef gets his attention and then he finally comes and processes your transaction but doesn't say \"thank you\" when he gives you your receipt to sign and you waver at how much tip to give and you just walk out going, \"Well, that was a beige experience if there ever was one\"?  Yeah, it was one of those places."}
{"text":"Tried this place out per friend recommendation.  Also known as Mr. Sushi.    Didn't expect to enjoy a sushi place situated next to a major freeway and a motel, but I really do!  I was told to try the Tootsie roll, which was really tasty.  But honestly, I was most impressed by the salmon sashimi.  Very inexpensive for sushi.  Perfect for a meal with friends or a casual date."}
{"text":"Finding a great sushi place in the neighborhood with an amazing happy hour, is like striking gold!!! Love this little place. Its nothing fancy but its everything you could want in a local sushi location. Awesome happy hour with $1 miso soup, and good service. I've been coming here for years and I love taking my friends and family. Never a bad time!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I come here at least once a week, and I love it!  We order the tropicana roll, tootsie roll, blue flame, and the spicy tuna or spicy salmon roll. It's delicious every time, without fail. I am never disappointed! The atmosphere is casual, so it's nice to be able to stop in for sushi even if I'm not dressed up.  If you're looking for a sushi place, your search is over!"}
{"text":"Six Shooter Roll & Jericho the great roll - It was good and cheap, but not as fresh as it use to be. To me the key to great sushi is really fresh fish."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant experience I've ever had! Not only is this place super slow in service but the food was not fresh!"}
{"text":"The reverse happy hour is the way to go! The jalapeño poppers are amazing- a must try when you visit. Sushi is okay, but still good. Great and fast service."}
{"text":"Great sushi and price is reasonable. They have multiple menus including a happy hour menu. They have sooooo many different rolls and are not packed with fillers like cream cheese as most average sushi joints do. Service could be better. 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"Happy Hour menu did not have a huge selection but the sushi was delicious and good service!"}
{"text":"Ok.. Food was outstanding.. Service needs work..  We sat down, and it took about 10 minutes for a young lady to take our drink order.  We've never been hear  before,  so we didn't know that you had to fill out an order form & give it to someone.  She  finally came back with the drinks, and  took the order form... It was happy hour, and  we took advantage of it.  We ordered some appetizers that should gave come FIRST, but actually came out after the rest of our order.  I had the soft shell shrimp which were fantadtic, but they still had the shell, and  vein on it.. and the heads!!!  I guess they assume that everyone uses chopsticks,  because they never brought any silverware..  And our supposed server never returned.  My husband sat there for 6 or 7 minutes with no fork,  while his hot food was getting cold. A guy was walking by, and  we asked him for a stupid fork.."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always smiling and friendly staff. The Sushi is the best in the valley for the price.  Went there again last night after not visiting for 6 or so month... and all I can say is that I do not go to this place enough.  TIP: If you are a lover of sushi rolls with a kick, the Blue Flame is a must."}
{"text":"Food is average. Service a little slow but very nice staff. Busy place, casual atmosphere. On the plus side, the prices are great."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews. We got here at happy hour. Our table got $1 miso soup, rainbow roll, blue flame roll, spicy tuna roll, sashimi salad, ramen, and takoyaki. Everything tasted really good. The batter on the outside of the blue flame was a little thicker than I wanted. The fish tasted very good on the rainbow roll. The sashimi salad was perfect for my friend who just really wanted fish. The ramen was a large portion. Our waitress was very attentive. If I was in the area, I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"This is the only place I eat sushi at. The fish is fresh and sushi is prepared when ordered. Everytime I go, I try something different and have not been disappointed yet. If you are a true seafood and sushi lover you need to come here."}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh considering we are nowhere near the ocean! Great lunch menu and friendly service. We are leaving stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi joint I've found in all of Arizona. Their happy hour prices and times are excellent and the sushi is made to perfection, there is something for everyone! I recommend the blue flame or the tootsie rolls, but honestly you can't go wrong with so many options available. The restaurant is always clean and the servers are always friendly and efficient, they can be a little hard to understand sometimes but this should be expected at a place so authentic. Plenty of places to park and don't let the outside of the building discourse you as the city is in the process of upgrading and remodeling the shopping center that this restaurant is located in."}
{"text":"We checked this place out for the first time, and man was it awesome. Very clean, very good service, and very tasty. To start with, a very informative menu with lots of pictures of different dishes. I thought that was a nice touch. Their portions are huge, and taste excellent. We will definitely be back. VERY GOOD LUNCH !"}
{"text":"Coming from Long Beach, Ca and living right near the ocean, I've always had the most fresh fish when it comes to my sushi.   I barely moved to AZ this past February. It took a while for me to find a good sushi restaurant. Being that we are in the middle of the desert, it was hard to find a place that served good tasting/fresh sushi until I came to Akai Hana. I've gone to both locations and both places had the most fresh tasting sushi. I always order the rainbow roll and it was very delicious here.   The staff was also very kind and attentive to their guests. Our waiter was always checking on us to make sure we didn't need anything. We didn't come during a slow period, so the staff is very on top of their customers.   Can't wait to go back for my weekly sushi date with my sister :)"}
{"text":"We live in a town where we can't get sushi so when we travel we are always craving to find it. What an awesome restaurant with great food and ambience. My grandsons love sushi and we also enjoyed the sweet restaurant owner (?) who gave my boys some origami art pieces. We had delicious fresh made sushi and heartwarming service. Fun and good!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. The food was not appetizing. My rolls were sitting in a pool of oil and had an unpleasant hot sauce instead of eel sauce or even spicy mayo and mostly consisted of about 70% rice. Oily rice balls with hot sauce. Gross. Not what I think of when I crave a Las Vegas roll. Sushi Bros is much better."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place on a whim and it has become our favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix. The happy hour prices are so inexpensive, so even if it wasn't the best quality it would still be worth it. However, we have been here at least half a dozen times, and each time we enjoy every roll we order. HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking for great sushi at a very fair price. :)"}
{"text":"Might be the best hole-in-the-wall sushi in PHX (read: this is not your typical Scottsdale joint). Sashimi cuts are generous and fresh. The uni (sea urchin) was exceptional; it was creamy but not fishy, which is a testament to the quality of the seafood here. If you want to try a roll that'll blow your mind, get the Butter Me Up roll. I don't normally like cooked rolls, but this one is perfection. Nothing is bad, except personally, I like to avoid the spicy mayo rolls. Enjoy!!! If you like sushi, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Price was great! Took a friend to lunch. He is a regular there... I'll try it again, but I wasn't wowed by the flavor. I got the lunch box (bento). presentation was nice. food wasn't bad, just wasn't my favorite. Next time I'll order something different."}
{"text":"This was a great find! My husband and I drove past it randomly and decided to stop in after seeing the other positive reviews. We weren't disappointed at all. I would recommend going during happy hour (from 4-6 and from 8-close). Better prices and a good selection even with the limited happy hour selections. But the normal sushi menu had probably 75 rolls or more to choose from. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is super fresh and priced just right! Lunch specials from 6.95 - 9.95! And every one worth the price charged. The place is packed at lunch so you should go only if you have an hour, otherwise I would suggest dinner or after work for happy hour! I recommend the sushi lunch special which is fresh and has a nice sampling of sushi with a wonderfully unique spicy salmon hand roll. Or the sashimi lunch special if you're avoiding the rice! If you're not into Sushi they serve a great teriyaki chicken special with a California roll, soup and a huge salad for only 6.95! All in all this is a great stop when you're craving fresh sushi at a great price! We will definitely return! Eat well, live well and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the planet it's so awesome you will never be disappointed it gets crowded on the weekends and especially during happy hour they have a extremely large fan based and once you eat there you will know why. My sushi chef is the older mature asian male he is the most seasoned chef. Sit at the bar and get faster service it's cozy but a little cramped."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to sushi and japanese cuisine. I have found one of the best sushi chefs in Phoenix. Sean, Tom, and the other sushi chefs really know how to be creative and provide great fresh sushi rolls. I see so many regulars talking to the chefs and saying that they will be back tomorrow.   You gotta try their spicy japanese dynamite salad, ceviche salad and their creative rolls.   You will not get enough of this goodness, I am from the islands and I know good fish/sushi!"}
{"text":"I find the sushi here to be run-of-the-mill.   The I-17/Northern-adjacent strip mall restaurant is kind of quiet and subdued compared to the Scottsdale joints, and I like it that way.  I come here when I want something dependable in the central Phoenix area without driving clear out to Scottsdale.  The fish here for the most part is fresh - nothing too creative here, and the interior isn't much to crow about either.   I find the sushi here to be better than Zen 32 (and cheaper), but not quite at the caliber of other standout places in town.  P.S.  I find the name a little peculiar.  Mr. Sushi??  I would normally scoff at a place called Senor Taco, Ms. Pasta or Madame Hot Dog.  But for some reason I'm ok with the cheesy name."}
{"text":"Best Happy hour in phoenix! I can get about 6 rolls during happy hour for $35. They are delicious and larger than other places I have visited. The staff is great too, especially Sean, who has tons of fun with the customers.  The energy here is great. Their location is hidden in an empty strip mall, but their business is always booming, so that tells you just how amazing this place is. I will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"I have been eating sushi for 10 years and this is the best place in the world.  They are known for their NUMBERS 1-10 (that is an insider's secret) in regards to the spicy factor.  Santos is not to be messed with.  You will often find him snickering at you from behind the sushi bar as sweat pours down your head.  He is a great sushi chef.  And don't let Ashino fool you with his quiet demeanor.  He is actually listening to every single word  you say!  Be careful how much sake you drink or he may just sneak a few drops of \"death sauce\" into your tuna handroll!  Haha!  yes, Mr. Sushi is the best.  Try \"The Karen Roll\" or if you are really wanting to make an impression, order the KSARGE roll which is NOT EVEN ON THE MENU!  Better yet, order PIGS IN THE BLANKET (Santos Style!).  Don't worry, he will know what to do!"}
{"text":"First time visit to Akaihana.  Pleasantly surprised by the awesome sushi rolls.  Although the dragon roll was a bit squishy/runny in the middle which made it a bit unpleasant to eat.  Cali rolls and spicy tuna rolls were great tasting.  The fried calamari was not calamari...more like fried fish sticks (not exaggerating). Service was good, fast and very cordial.  The place could use booths."}
{"text":"Two favorite rolls are the Butter me Up and Blue Flame. Get a Shrimp Boat if your a little adventurous."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was craving some sushi and our regular place is closed on Sundays so a coworker of hers suggested this place.  Really disappointing.  While they have an extensive menu, there are lots of rolls that they have no description for.  Its frustrating to assume that everyone that comes in to your restaurant is a sushi expert or that they would have to sit there and ask what various rolls are.  My girlfriends sashimi came out and the fish were no where near as cold as you'd want raw fish to be and they used a ton of imitation crab in their hand rolls.  Basically left her with edamame and jalapeno poppers.  When jalapeno poppers are the best thing on a customers tab by a wide margin in a SUSHI restaurant, might want to get some new chefs in there.  I ordered somen noodles (which where pictured and looked nothing like the picture) teriyaki chicken (could have used another 30 seconds in the microwave or maybe less time in the window), rice and goyza (over priced, for the number of pieces you get, 5) and a cherry coke.    Ironically the cherry coke was REALLY good, i believe they used cherry syrup in addition to the coca-cola as opposed to the cherry coke that coca-cola company produces.  The service was pretty lacking, all in all not worth the drive and the happy hour on Sunday was enough to get us in there but I can't imagine returning."}
{"text":"Love this little place!! The Blue Flame roll was amazazing!! I loved the we were able to buy our own chopsticks."}
{"text":"Very good Sushi excellent happy hour prices our new close by sushi restaurant. The sushi rolls are large try the Rainbow roll the California rolls are good too."}
{"text":"Expensive AND bland. It was our first time here and, undoubtedly, our last. The miso soup had no flavor as did the sushi and tempura. I ordered a shrimp hand roll that I could not for the life of me figure out what it was!!! Incredibly bad food for inflated prices."}
{"text":"I have ate here in the past, and they did a great job on lunch today. Service was fast, people were friendly, food was good. Nothing too stellar about this establishment, everything is the way it should be.  The reason I gave three stars was that my rolls kept falling apart when I picked them up with the chop sticks, it was very hard to manage and then a section would fall out and I had to scoop it up.  The cucumber salad is different and with long shredded strands of cucumber and a nice sesame sprinkle a light vinegar dressing. I did nothing out the ordinary on the rolls as i ordered from the Happy Hour specials - great prices BTW!  Its a decent place to try, so swing by if you have a craving."}
{"text":"A friend and I drove over to the other side of town to try Mr. Sushi, per the recommendation of her brother.  We waited twenty minutes for the waiter to come to our table.  Then it took an hour and twenty more minutes to get the food.  By the time the sushi arrived, we were starving.  The presentation was excellent, and I was anticipating some excellent sushi goodness.  Wrong.  I looked at my friend and said, \"this tastes like it came out of the LA River.\"  She agreed.  We paid the bill and left most of the food still on the plates.  It was completely unpalatable.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place! I've tried other ones but nothing beats this one! It's delicious and so inexpensive! You can get a great deal here for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"I am a sushi -a - holic.  The food was FANTASTIC.  I was in town for the Pro Bowl and came across this restaurant, which is hidden, because it was just outside my hotel room.  Went on a Friday night around 8P.  The service, not so good, but the food was amazing!!!!  The best oysters on the half shell I've had since I left Florida years ago.  The wild salmon roll was out of this world.  It's a shame I don't think I'll be returning to Phoenix.  I'd be a regular at Akaihana Sushi!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in the west valley if not the entire valley to get sushi!  They changed the name but the location is the same.  I was looking for sushi on Sherpa and came across this well reviewed place.  Man am I glad!  I had talked a friend into trying sushi one more time (the first time was at a place in Sedona my mistake!).  We ordered the Hollywood roll - SWEET LORD was it good my friend said it was one of the best foods he ever had never mind the sushi part it was just that good.  We also tried the Hannah roll which was very good as well!  Please support this place, so many places are disappearing in Phx due to the economy and its hard enough to find Good food in Phx let alone this great!  If you use Sherpa or a I phone ap please review its what helped me find this place!  I usually won't try a unreviewed place as food is usually poor quailty in Phx."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience coming into the door, fresh sushi, and different combinations make this one of our faves.  That spicy tuna cracker was the best thing we have ever eaten here, ever . In the 6 years we have been coming.   The music is awesome. Come here."}
{"text":"My friend found this spot and I would definitely return. The location is kind of odd because it's right by the freeway and we missed the entrance because it was dark. The restaurant was charming and had Japanese decor. The fish tasted fresh and the pieces were large! I was slowing down toward the end of my meal. You get your bang for your buck. The special I had with nigiri, hand roll and spicy tuna roll plus a sashimi salad was about $13-15. There were a lot of people dining in. I'm looking forward to going back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I was afraid to try sushi in Arizona. Its just this thing I have with a place not being that close to the ocean and selling raw fish. Its an equation in my head that doesn't make sense.   My uncle really wanted sushi and wanted to take me to his favorite place. Being this place. We showed up ten minutes before they closed. I felt so bad because I hated that when I worked in retail and just wanted to close up my store and someone would walk in two minutes till closing. That sometimes is bad too because you may get the remnants of what was good earlier that day and isn't anymore.   We promised to be fast and we ordered really fast and the food was on our table really fast. We devoured our meal with delight. The rolls were so good. Some of the best sushi I have had. I cant remember what I bought but everything was good. Even the spicy stuff I tried. I don't normally eat the spicy stuff but this stuff was really good. My uncle was right about this place. I left a good tip too because we were there late."}
{"text":"Oh Akai Hana. Why are you so far away. I wish I could take you in my pocket and bring you back to Tempe. (lol creepy.)  Boyfriend and I made the 26 minute trek to check out Akai Hana's reverse happy hour menu. I remember the time because I WAS SO HUNGRY AND EXCITED.   Service wasn't crazy fast, but not as stupid long as Sushi Kee in Tempe. (You should avoid Sushi Kee Tempe at all costs. You have been warned.)  But oh my god, when the rolls came out.. they were GENEROUS with the fish, and the rolls were BIG.  Would I come back to Akai Hana with Mido Sushi just around the corner? ...I might. It's definitely in the realm of possibility.  If you are in the area and can make Akai Hana's reverse happy hour (8pm onwards) - I URGE YOU TO CHECK IT OUT.  My party of two got six rolls for $40, including tip."}
{"text":"What a truly great find.      One Sunday my g/f did a search on her phone for Sunday happy hours,  first on the google list was this place from 3-6 and 8-9 on Sundays they have a great sushi happy hour.    Don't let your first impressions fool you, it's not in a great neighborhood (and by that I mean its not 'bad', just not great).   They seem to be the only surviving place in the strip mall just about Northern on I17.   I usually won't go to a new sushi place on a Sunday because of the freshness of the fish etc... but it turned out to be a great place and fantastic food and the price was a SUPERB DEAL!  We went in, place only had about 12 people in it at that time.  Staff were very friendly, polite, quick to bring menus, drinks etc.   We ordered Edamame, calamari, and 6 rolls.   We are still not sure why we ordered 6, but the prices were so low we assumed they would be smaller portions like you get at other happy hours.  WRONG  We had so much food we ended up setting up a buffet on the next table!   Apart from the Tropicana roll, which had some weird apricot gel on it... everything was seriously good!  Vegas roll, California, spicy tuna, caterpillar, spicy salmon & Tropicana+ 2 ice teas and 2 appetizers, under $40.     Great find.  We were going to go again but we missed the happy hour deadline."}
{"text":"Never going back.  When we got there, we were like \"wait, is this Mr. Sushi? or Akaihana Sushi?\" since the restaurant has both names in front.  When you go in, you see the sushi counter with one Japanese chef and rest, Mexican chefs.  They seated us at the very back corner where it was pretty dark.....it was so dark that we had to squint our eyes to see the menu.  There were screaming kids, squeaking fans all over and waitresses having fun chatting.  The food...omg, it's as bad as Ra.  We ordered combination plate b., i., and \"mistake\" roll.  Believe me they are all BAD....afterwards, I got a tummy ache......sigh.  *Ambiance = dark, low-class *Service = if you like your waitresses having fun chatting about their relationships and stuff, yeah you will like it *Food = .....BAD -beef teriyaki = TOUGH -sashimi = it's interesting how a Japanese person can serve that proudly and call it sashimi. -california roll = we usually do our best to finish the plate but it was just not possible. -tempura = ok overall but they definitely use OLD oil -rice = cheap rice for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place.  I've been frequenting this place for the last 4 years.  Their hot green tea is strong and hot just the way I like it. This place has the best rainbow roll. The rainbow roll and crunchy California roll are a must. The service is good and they've recently remodeled. The place looks good."}
{"text":"Tonight was very delicious. We both had bento type boxes and the food was nice and fresh. Kirin light to top it off. Very good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I know the name \"Mr. Sushi\" sounds corny and you're thinking I'm not eating sushi in a strip mall but you're just missing out.  These guys make the best sushi in town.  It's always fresh, they have a menu thats like a novel.  I always try a new roll when I go and I never leave disappointed and always bloated.  It's hard to stop when it's this good.  The atmosphere is nothing special but you can tell it's good by the local following and business crowd they attract.  Sit at the bar if available and watch the show.  It may seem out of the way especially for you east siders but round up some friends and make the drive:  Its worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Server was friendly, we didn't get our drinks for about 10-15 mins but it was very busy so I wasn't mad about it. Not a lot of space to move around in there, it's very cramped when busy. But the sushi was excellent, the seaweed salad was great. The menu is huge so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good place for the west side.. Nestled inside the chasm of a very non descript strip mall off the beaten sunny slope path on Northern and the 17 Freeway..   I looked to it as a hidden sushi island .. hidden away from the world for me to discover... So I discovered.. and here is my report..  O.k. happy hour.. A couple of names Mr Sushi or Akaihana which I think means \"red flower\". Reading other peoples reviews going back I guess it has had a few names? ..  Anyway ..Its a good lunch and quick drink place. not much else I am pretty certain of.  I have eaten here twice now and I am glad I did before reviewing it. tonight's subsequent visit has served as a more complete look at the place.  The first time I ate there I ended up sitting next to the owner by total coincidence. It was he who guided me to the specialty hand rolls. I had the lobster the butter me up and a few others that he recommended. I would give that experience 4 stars.  This time however... unfortunately for me was not quite the experience of the previous one :{ The happy hour was crowded Tonight so it took a while to get any service.. I sat there for a good 10 min before getting my beer. Whatever it was busy..but I had to wait 5 min for them to even look at me when I walked in the door. Sorta annoying..  The fish was not that fresh and I guess I would expect it to be on a Friday? I had just a simple dragon roll and the thing fell apart trying to eat it. The squid salad was o.k... All for about 20$ with a sake bomber The experience was a 2 star one..  I gotta give them credit that some of the special rolls are pretty tasty. The rest was just average .. and the service this time was pretty painful.  Everyone I have ever talked to in the place has told me it was their favorite..There seems to be good local following... and the place was packed for the new happy hour, so maybe I just got the \"raw\" end of the deal this time?..  You will want this place to go if your in the neighborhood and certainly go to it for the rolls to at least try em,, but my Yelp app will be primed for a new place the next time I am on the west side."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i come here whenever we're craving sushi (which is very often) and we love this place. The people are really friendly and the sushi is the best we've had so far. Surprisingly its very cheap; If you're ever in the area i strongly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"This is now my new go to sushi place, it's so good!! They have a great happy hour menu with so many options. My boyfriend and I went for the first time last week and have already gone back a couple of times since then! I am a vegan but they have so many choices- I have ordered the cucumber avocado roll, cucumber roll and my favorite is the kampyo roll made with sweet gourd. My boyfriends favorites have been the blue flame roll, tootsie roll, and the fried California roll. We love the food and the prices and we will continue to come back!! I definitely would recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to look over the menu for a while. It's the cheescake factory is sushi rolls. I have only tried 7 rolls here but they were all very good. It's worth the trip to make it to this small but abondant specialty rolls restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried a new five alarm chili. It was nice and hot. Spicy shrimp  roll was great.  Even their California  roll is  very good. Place was hopping  . They are reasonably  priced . We like this place"}
{"text":"Major points to this sushi restaurant for coming up with creative variations that work. For instance, who else would have thought that fresh tomato could make a delightfully fresh and tasty roll (the Summer Tomato Roll, to be specific)? But it makes sense, as tomato is one of the best natural sources of glutamate, the umami element. The other rolls we had were equally satisfying. The large dining area with contemporary vibe, the superb sushi, and prices that are really good for the quality and quantity of the food explain the popularity of this sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Best sushi and best price in town! I usually come on Saturdays and get the lunch sushi special and one roll off the happy hour menu. Been coming here for years. The fish is always delicious and the service is friendly. They recently renovated inside and it looks trendy and upscale without being overpriced. This place is always busy and that's for a good reason! Come here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A nice find in a unassuming Location. Came on a Monday night and the place was decently busy. I ordered the jalapeño poppers and a few rolls. the jalapeño poppers were good, not too spicy. Fish tasted fresh and the veggies too!"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi with a good variety of specialty rolls. The prices, both happy hour and normal, are pretty affordable. This place gets extremely busy though, so expect to wait a bit for your food (both take out and sit down). The have a little room off to the side for bigger parties which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this great restaurant by accident. It's hidden at the back of a strip center and very hard to see. Fabulous service with amazing lunch specials. Everything we ordered was delicious! We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a good sushi spot since I moved to the Glendale/Phoenix area and this is my favorite out of the ones I've been to so far. They have a huge selection of sushi and each dish is unique and delicious. However, my only complaint so far is that their udon did not meet my expectations. But, I'll keep coming back just so I can try the whole sushi menu!"}
{"text":"I love this little spot! Great food & good service and the prices are so reasonable! I'd eat here every day if I could. Their Tropicana roll is my wife's absolute favorite."}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. Ever. A little bit of a drive but my family has been going here for 10 years. It's always fresh, delicious & there is a huge varieties of rolls. I wish it was closer so I could visit more often. If you're in the area don't pass it up."}
{"text":"I was not A sushi person until I came here. They have cooked sushi (blue flame roll) freakin amazing. Clean and always busy. The service is good and it's not that expensive. Good sake, cute decor. Highly recommend this place. Never have had a bad meal and it turned me on to sushi, huge diverse menu."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was good.  Sushi special for $9 included 2 classics, the spicy tuna roll and california roll, plus Tuna, Salmon, White fish and Crab.  Miso Soup and Salad too.  Yes, it was a lot for a lunch!  I will be back again to enjoy lunch and try their other varieties.  Would recommend this spot for anyone looking to try sushi or the savvy sushi buyer.  Nice setting and friendly service."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fantastic and judging by the Saturday night dinner crow, I was not alone in that opinion.  We had a number of rolls, I wish I could remember them all now but they were all fabulous.  My only complaint is that the service is very slow.  Our waitress brought us waters and disappeared for about 20 minutes.  I had to flag her down to place our order and to get the check.  However despite that I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend her for her birthday. The place is really busy but parking was not a problem. It was a bit noisy. They have a some nice boat dishes that look cool in presentation.  There does not seem like anything special is around this restaurant so it stands alone to me.   The service is friendly but is too busy and has some language road bumps but they did keep the place neat and clean.   The price was typical for most sushi places I have been too however, they did not have an all you can eat option.  The best part of the meal was the desert that was not on the main menu. I thought that it was ridiculous that they would leave it off. I saw others with the ice cream tempura on their table and I wanted it too. Since the sushi takes 15 plus minutes after ordering I ordered the ice cream first. It was totally worth it, it was beautiful and fun!  The hollywood roll was my favorite but the eel roll, which is my standard, was not what I thought it would be. Only some of the rolls were great. (Hollywood and ice cream tempura, however your mileage may vary - ymmv).  If it was convenient I might try it again for happy hour."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi! I definitely recommend coming in and trying the crazy roll (pictured)! The portions are large and the food is delicious! The staff is friendly and authentically Japanese-family owned and run!"}
{"text":"Not too far from my work.  Average sushi with abundant selection of hand rolls."}
{"text":"After getting into a discussion with a coworker about the merits of spending large amounts of money on single Japanese dinners, a craving for sushi set in.  I didn't think there were any good sushi bars nearby work, but considering we were just having lunch, I was OK with average sushi for this occasion.  The reviews for this place were middling, but the photos painted a different picture, so we gave it a shot.  We rolled up to the place, and found an empty business park, except for this one restaurant set back from the main road.  Definitely a hole-in-the-wall, and not a location the hipsters and yuppies will be flocking anytime soon.  We sat down at the bar, and noticed a wall plastered with different specials.  Some rolls, some not rolls, some frog legs, some soups, etc.  A complete olio of handwritten dishes, some of which may have been up there for ages for all I could tell.  I ordered an assortment of sushi, the grilled hamachi kama, the ankimo (any place that serves ankimo is automatically above average), a bluefin toro hand roll (not on the menu, but I asked the chef to make me one), and an uni shooter.  As the sushi arrived, it became clear to me that the chef actually knew what he was doing.  He was an older Japanese gentleman with a hard-to-decipher accent, and clearly he was trained in the art of traditional sushi.  The sushi was properly garnished such that I didn't have to use soy sauce on but one or two items, the rice properly melted in my mouth, and the meal was properly paced.  Those who prefer their sushi Americanized and doused in wasabi may not find this place to be anything special, due to its lack of \"scene.\"  But as a fan of traditional sushi, I would say this is one of the top three places I have found in the Phoenix area. And to think I had worked less than a mile away for nine months without knowing about it!"}
{"text":"Also and formerly known as \"Mr. Sushi.\"  This is the first place I ever tried real \"raw\" sushi.  I was probably about 13 years old when my parents introduced me to Mr. Sushi and I had only ever tried a california roll before.  Well Akai Hana opened my mind to so many other varities of sushi.  I fell in love with tuna :)   They also serve hot dishes and bento boxes. Very authentic with a variety of seafood, good prices and happy hour all of the time until 5pm and after 8pm-9/10pm depending on the day of the week.  My favorite happy hour rolls are the blue flame, spicy tuna hand roll, and the tuna roll.  This is probably my favorite sushi place of all time.  My family and I have spent almost every birthday here since I we have been coming here together for about 15 years.  On birthdays the sushi chefs will  make a special roll for you or bring out green tea ice cream with a candle in it and take a couple of polaroid pix for their wall and one for you to take home.  You can also call and request there special room for a more intimate time with a larger party of people.  I highly recommend giving this place a shot-you will have a great experience from the moment you walk in when the sushi chefs personally greet to the moment you leave with a belly full of sushi :)"}
{"text":"I wish I liked Akai Hana, as they have all the items that I would look for in a Japanese restaurant. The prices are definitely affordable too. Came in during happy hour and had a spicy salmon roll, seaweed salad, soft shell crab and shumai. The roll was made out of rice that was overcooked and the pieces all fell apart. Seaweed salad and shumai were nothing special. The soft shell crab was a tiny piece of crab for $6. It was the best thing I had among everything I ordered, but I wish they added a little more breading. Over all, this place just isn't for me. Service wasn't great, my water was never refilled and I felt like I was bothering my server.   I do know a couple of people who frequent this place and swear that this is the best Japanese restaurant in Arizona. I would still recommend you to try it; maybe I just came at the wrong time."}
{"text":"I've had sushi twice in Arizona and I think that dallas just has better sushi.  The prices were phenomenal here during happy hour.  The sushi just wasn't that great. Ive had way better in Dallas.  One of our rolls had crab in it and my friend are a piece and ended up finding a piece of shell in her food.  It made her turned off by eating anything else so she couldn't even finish her lunch.  The waitress was kind enough to not charge us for it but this spot kind of ruined sushi for me for some time."}
{"text":"Sushi A No No  I came for the lunch happy hour specialsand was impressed with the pricing. I managed to get three rolls for under $15. My friends were able to get the Bento box and sushi special for under $10 each.  My main dishes or the spicy tuna roll, the blue flame roll, and the salmon skin roll.  Best roll was the blue flame roll. It is very reminiscent of a Las Vegas roll but without the cream cheese. It is not spicy at all despite the warnings. Very heavy roll due to it being fried 3.5/5  Spicy tuna roll is not spicy at all. The fish quality is not very high either. Very forgettable. 3/5  The worst roll is the salmon skin roll. I have ordered this dish from other restaurants before but this is the worst iteration I have ever tasted. The salmon is over cooked, and honestly reminds me of salmon from a can. You can't taste any crispy salmon skin. Unedible. Normally I don't waste food but I could not eat more than one piece. 1/5."}
{"text":"The happy hour is very reasonable and the service is always on point. My favorite roll is the Blue Flame by far. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmr. Sushi!   This was the place I lost my sushi virginity to, and the place responsible to getting me hooked!   I love the location, right off of the freeway, as if it were a sushi pit stop! The best part of this place is it's very low key and casual. A comforting place to pig out on sushi. The sushi is very authentic which is rare in an over-sushied city. Each roll is beyond delicious and made to perfection. This place is underrated. Grade A rolls at a low key location? Awesome!!  The service is also very speedy, hooray! This is a perfect place for a quick lunch.  I'm still a huge Mr. Sushi fan after so many years. Four stars!"}
{"text":"I remember when AkaiHana was called Mr. Sushi and am beyond pleased that the quality of the sushi remains top notch!  I decided to bring an out of town guest since his sushi experience prior was limited to sushi buffets. He loved sitting at the bar and watching our rolls being prepped.   Our sushi chef, Jack, was quiet, but amicably responded to any of our questions after he announced each of our rolls as they were ready. He even gave a free sample of sashimi!   My friend's favorite roll was the Tootsie Roll because of the crunch and sweet sauce.  My favorite was the Butter Me Up ... Garlic butter with a hint of wasabi topped with seared salmon!   I also enjoy the remodeled open concept space.    I will definitely be back!  Side Note: \"Who Says\" by Selena Gomez played in the background ... Her music is one of my guilty pleasures.:)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mr Sushi for the past 5 yrs. They are actually open for lunch on Saturdays. They have the best lunch specials and my favorite rolls i order are the Mexican and New York roll. Love their salad dressing and all the different appetizers.   The only complaint i have about this place is that sometimes they will have a all you can eat night and of course on those nights the place gets packed. They do not seem to have enough staff to accommodate such a large number of customers on those nights. They need better planning on those nights. We must have waited at least 30 minutes just to order."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi selection and sushi for sure!!!  Happy hour even better, and they have happy hour on weekends as well!  Service sucks, so dont go there super hungry, order appy as soon as you sit down.  But so worth the wait."}
{"text":"The sushi seemed pretty over priced, and I am not sure, but I think that both my friend and I got food poisoning from this place."}
{"text":"I love Akihana! This is hands down my favorite sushi place in Phoenix. They have an amazing selection of sushi rolls and a wide variety of extras to try out - luke the frog legs (give em a try, you won't be sorry). The service is great and the bar tenders are hilarious! Try a panty dropper - it's a martini with sea urchins in it, unless you got shit to do later, it will mess you up!"}
{"text":"I got the blue flame roll (mainly crab) and the manhattan roll (shrimp+raw salmon) Blue flame--- 6/10 (its kinda confusing, you cant really tell what you are eating) Manhattan---- 10/10 (this one is really good... definitely recommending it to everyone)  My sister got the combo shrimp tempura with sashimi and vege salad... the tempura was okey. The sessame salad with their dressing was amazing! (Get anything with the salad and dressing)  I would give this a 4 star if only we had better service during the dinner. This is one of the slowest japanese place i ever had. I think it was mainly because of our server. The other servers were swift so i guess i cannot generalize the whole place with poor service. They have a lot of choices for their rolls so i still want to comeback and try the others!  So should you...  :P"}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles. I've been to many, many sushi restaurants.   I'm visiting my uncle in Phoenix, decide to try the place next door to my hotel.   AMAZING. hands down the best sushi I have ever had... GET THE LAS VEGAS ROLL!!! You will immediately evolve into a dashingly handsome full grown Charizard, after eating this evolution stone called sushi.  You will literally become the President of Your mom after eating here.  You will go home satisfied and ready to fight the war on terrorism."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and the first time I was able to actually try the food. 1st time I came and waited an hour and didn't even get my food before I had to return to work.  Second time sat at the sushi bar and it was ok. Got a spicy tuna and Tropicana roll. Wasn't impressed by the sushi at all. Glad I only paid $10  Probably won't be back. Not worth the wait"}
{"text":"Great food, HORRIBLE service. I've been coming here for a while and I love their rolls! However, the last few times I've come it's taken close to 30 minutes to get seated and hours to receive our order... overall really disorganized and hectic. Doesn't seem like the staff communicates..."}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to the world of Sushi, yesterday I came to Mr. Sushi with some coworkers and we ordered a variety of rolls.  I started with my \"go to\" California rolls, and tried for the first time some Vegas rolls, and some other rolls of which the names escape me right now.  It was all pretty good, I'm sure there is better out there but on this day I left with my Sushi craving satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and sashimi etc. great little place in northern Phoenix. Authentic sushi chefs, great quality food. Big sushi bar.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of eating raw fish, but this restaurant always satisfies me with its extended cooked food menu, especially its appetizers. It's almost five star for the food, service, and prices. Tried lots of different items. Everything is up to expectations except for the Sukiyaki. The Sukiyaki was served appealing and tasted good. however, the beef was hand-cut into very thick pieces and too chewy. Wish the chef could improve it by slicing the beef thinner next time."}
{"text":"**Best sushi in ALL of Phoenix** I frequent this place very regularly and I never get tired of eating it. They have a huge variety of choices to choose from, so you'll never bore. Variety range from vegetarian/vegan rolls to meaty rolls and even low carb rolls. Staff is always friendly and very helpful. Each sushi chef has his own unique style/flare and it is definitely represented in their cooking. Granted all the chefs cooking AMAZINGLY, my family and I have our favorite chef named Sean while my friends have their favorite chef named Hero. You take your pick lol! I would 1000% recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!  Prices were even better,.  Salmon skin roll was the best I've had.  Wait staff SUCKS!  Cute college girls that are DUMB!  Don't bother asking any questions.  When I go back, I'll sit at the sushi bar!!  The place is small and quaint.  Clean..  I saw a couple get up and leave due to no service."}
{"text":"Food was great, Servers were attentive and very nice. They have a large menu with some great dishes that I haven't had since visiting Japan!  I will definitely come back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A young lady named kiokiri-sorry if I spelled it wrong-was super attentive and great service from her.   Anyways, great sushi selection and beverages. Thanks again kiokiri."}
{"text":"AAAAMMMMMMAAAAZZZZINNNNNGGGG! I have been going here for about 3 years now and I've never been disappointed. The service is always amazing and the food is delicious, not to mention cheap! They know me by name and I even have my own chopsticks in house!   It is small and can get busy on Fridays but I promise you it is worth the wait!  I recommend my favorite, The Mexican Roll (Tuna, cucumber, and Habanero) it's spicy! To cool things down Billy super tuna!   Give it a try, this place beats any other any day of the week."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch while waiting for a Bookman's order and were pleasantly surprised! Great lunch specials and lovely service. Blue Flame roll was awesome"}
{"text":"Mr. Sushi has a awesome happy hour. Service is always mediocre to sub par... So sit at the bar vs a table. Good rolls.. Interesting rolls... Not great rolls...good prices..and friendly staff behind the sushi bar.."}
{"text":"Love hole in the wall joints like this.  Great sushi plus a nice complete menu of Japanese faves.  Always a favorite.  Its our neighborhood go to spot for sushi and drinks."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi for an affordable price! I have been coming here fairly often since discovering this little mom and pop place a couple years ago. I have never had to wait an extensive period of time for my food, in fact, theyre so quick, that ive been like \"hold on, i have my other rolls to eat!\" Every person that i have taken here has been somewhat of a sushi snob and they have raved about this place. everything is fresh and affordable, you can have a full meal, leaving you stuff and hating your growing belly for less than 20 bucks (providing that you take part in Happy Hour, which is phenomenal pricing!) otherwise without HH, the prices are still quite good. Now i know there are 2 locations and im not sure which one of the locations these negative reviewers went to, but i frequent the location on i-17 and Northern and THIS location is amaze-balls."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. I actually went on my first date with my current partner here. It's a bit nostalgic for me.  The happy hour is great! They make a TON of different rolls and they do them well and the fish is very fresh. The chef is excellent and friendly.  The Vegas roll is unlike any Vegas roll you've had before. Give it a try.  The Mexican roll....holy smokes! I swear they put a whole habanero into it. I thought I was going to die! Be careful with this one...  I've never had anything but the sushi in here so I cannot comment on anything else.  Give it a try and make sure you get a lot!  Oh, and try the lobster or scallop dynamite....it is DYNAMITE!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi place in all of Phoenix Metro.  Shawn the General Manger is always helpful and how he remembers people who come in by name is a crazy skill.  The remodeled so there is twice the seating that was there before and they added a bar.  I gladly drive from Mesa up to Phoenix just to have Sushi there.  It's worth the drive and the prices during happy hour are the best of any place I have been too.  Yes, its a 5 star rating, It's always been top quality."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Had the Blue Flame roll and loved it! Very popular neighborhood sushi bar with friendly and efficient staff. We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing Sushi, the owner is funny as $hi+ and always welcomes us. Happened to come here on a friends recommendation, Mr.Sushi roll is off the charts."}
{"text":"Prices moderate, large selection of sushi.  But a majority of sushi had imitation crab stick or crab salad. I don't like either and had to look at menu closely to make sure it didn't have those on it. The sushi that I had was good. Although most Sushi came in a soy sauce bath which I could have done without. But Sushi was fresh yummy and served promptly. I see reviews mentioning appetizers but I do not see any appetizers mentioned on the menu. Wait staff did not offer refills on soda and we're not really involved with customers. The people who are making sushi delivered sushi but I was sitting at the bar so that may be different at a table. Not sure if I would return with a moderate prices and imitation crab . I did ask about price difference with adding real crab and it was around $6 per roll which is expensive compared to other places."}
{"text":"Service is friendly, environment is laid back. Knocked a few stars for pricing and flavor. The surf&turf roll is beyond the saltiest roll I have ever tasted. The salt overpowered the garlic and the meat on top was bland! How?! They used smoked salmon instead of fresh salmon for my philly roll... not cool. Rainbow roll was ok. Nothing to rave about though. The only lovely part of the meal was the salmon sashimi. It was delicious. Other than that I'm unimpressed."}
{"text":"Nice place, good food, good service. I arrived during happy hour and gorged on good sushi."}
{"text":"Hidden gem - tucked away in a non descript strip shopping center, I almost missed it!  I'm glad I didn't - freshly made, great service, and reasonably priced.  Huge selection of sushi - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little family owned place with great food for a great price (especially during happy hour/reverse happy hour). I like the teriyaki chicken dinner plate, the Yaki Soba, the caterpillar roll and the classic rainbow roll."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, tasty food, friendly service, and near my house.    Can't ask for more than that, really.    Lots of variety, both dining room seating and bar seating (where you can watch the guys make your sushi up close) and great lunch and happy hour specials.  Just go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Best Ever,  we go as much as we can.   Impeccable food,  service could use some coaching but you hardly care when the food arrives and almost forget when the check comes,  it is so inexpensive!!!!  This place is always packed,  and for good reason."}
{"text":"Best Sushi. For people who like to eat real sushi. Down to earth good food. Not pretentious like other sushi places that offer a 'scene'.   Now with Takoyaki!"}
{"text":"Pricey sushi but its WORTH IT. Normally when I want a quick fix I hit up cheaper places but when I'm in the mood for great sushi with a friend, I go to Akaihana."}
{"text":"Good relatively cheap sushi, although all of the sushi has the same crab salad filling. It's not the highest quality but good. Got the fried cali rolls and they were a decent 8 ish rolls for 6 bucks.  Can't complain for the price.  3 stars only because the filling is literally the same for everything and it all kind of tastes the same.  But it's cheap and easy so I would still recommend it."}
{"text":"Best sushi in phx for the best price. Ra? Stingray? Why bother... Save your money and still get the best quality sushi. Happy hour is a must. I go every Tuesday."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi spot! Sever was awesome and food was amazing! My FAMILY and I will be coming back most definitely!!"}
{"text":"I flippin' love this place. Love I love the chaotic menus (which are posted all over the walls) I love that they have fresh wasabi I love that they have frogs legs  I only wish it were closer to my house."}
{"text":"Good Sushi place, actually one of my favorite places to eat sushi because it's convenient located off I17 and Northern close to home.  The service is always good and the food always fresh."}
{"text":"I come to Akaihana a lot. Like far more than I probably should given it's almost the opposite end of town for me. There a couple reasons I come here but the key ones are fair prices and good sushi. The others are it's a nice central meeting spot for my buddies and I and also right by my girlfriends work.  When I come here 9 out of 10 times I am ordering the Sushi Special ($13) which is a cali roll, 5 pieces of nigiri, a spicy salmon hand roll, miso soup and their special salad. The salad (on the menu as dynamite salad) is one of my favorite things it's cucumber noodles with chunks of various fish in a light but spicy marinade. The salad size with the sushi special is a pretty decent size but the half size on the menu is pretty much a meal for 1 person for $7. It does tend to be a bit of a crap shoot on the quantity of the fish in it though. The sushi special as a whole though is a solid meal even for somebody like me who can put down a lot of sushi.  Happy hour prices are fantastic here and run almost all day on the weekdays. I think cali rolls run about $3.50 on happy hour and spicy tuna isn't much more.  Other things I have liked are the shrimp boats which are pretty unique and they have plenty of other in house special rolls.  There are two reasons why this place isn't a five star, the first and primary being service. The service here can be really hit or miss, sometimes is great and things come out quick and you get attended to quickly. Other times you may wait 10 minutes for a drink refill or 30 minutes+ for sushi. I've had cases where we have been in and out in about 30-45 minutes and other times where it took 30 minutes before we got the first roll. I've also had items get forgotten or watched them sit ready at the counter for 10 minutes before having to ask the status. This is really amplified when the restaurant is busy. However I will say the servers are very nice and never rude or off putting, they just aren't always on the ball.  The second issue is minor but worth noting in that the rolls can sometimes be rolled too loose where they come apart too easy. Sometimes I think this is an issue with the rice they are using and sometimes the chef. I don't have much of an issue working around this but it's hard for chopstick newbies or those who aren't fully comfortable with chopsticks.  Overall the value, fish quality and options for tasty bites here far outweigh the service issues."}
{"text":"Not only a great sushi but awesome prices for happy hour. Sunday and Monday they have a reverse happy hour from 8 till close."}
{"text":"Delicious   When it comes to creativity Akaihana Sushi and Grill sets the bar.  Don't expect the usual lineup of everyday sushi, Akaihana Sushi and Grill is the place to explore taste variations.  As you walk into Akaihana Sushi and Grill you immediately get the feeling of being at your favorite local spot.  The staff are welcoming, accommodating, and will even help you  navigate the specials and regular menu entrees.    We ordered appetizers, sashimi and maki rolls from the daily special and regular menu and were impressed.  Everything was very fresh and delicious.  Prices are wallet friendly and the variety of sushi rolls will satisfy everybody's craving and for the non-sushi eaters, Akaihana's offers cooked entrees as well.   If you are craving Sushi stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good happy hour but I'd rather pay more for fresh sushi. Mediocre at most.   Edamame was soggy, rolls poorly made, ingredients were not fresh, and service was nothing special."}
{"text":"AKA Mr. Sushi... that's what one of the signs say on the building. I have gone to sushi fairly regularly for years starting back when I lived in California and I think this is my favorite sushi place in Phoenix because of the selection, quality/freshness of food, happy hour and portion sizes.  Standard prices normally, but they have a really good sushi happy hour from 4-6 and the portions are bigger than average.  The atmosphere is what I expect from a real Japanese joint that is geared for good food, not fancy advertising or upscale decor. The chef (owner?), most of the employees as well as a good percentage of the patrons speak Japanese so you know it's not a bullshit sushi place.  The quality of the fish has always been very good and the selection of items is grand. I especially enjoy the blue fin (aka toro) nigiri; it's probably the best I've had. I have been impressed with everything I have ordered."}
{"text":"This goes on my list for every trip back to Phoenix. They have some unique items you don't see everyday and plenty of fish options to try. Overall they are friendly and the food is really good. Can't really think of any negatives."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here at least 10 times, and I'll say the sushi is great every time, but the service is a little hit or miss. Me, my bf, and his friend came during happy hour today around 5:25pm and no one came to take our drink order, but the hostess noticed it had been about 5 minutes and she did offer to get our drinks. However, oddly, the green tea was quite watered down. We mentioned so and were brough fresh green teas, which were much better. When our server took our order, he was definitely in a hurry. He never brought us plates, accidentally put our sriracha sauce at the table behind us, and actually set his tray down on our table with our soups and teriyaki chicken, and walked away for us to serve ourselves. A different server gal noticed and came to retrieve the tray.  As for the rolls, tasty as usual. We shared the Tootsie roll (cooked salmon and crab), Kodiak roll (cooked salmon and avocado), fried California roll, and Blue Flame roll (crab salad and crab stick with avocado, deep fried). They were all very good, but the deep fried rolls were a little over cooked.  This is the first time we've had an experience this much less stellar than other visits, but overall, we still had a tasty dinner, and for 4 rolls, 2 green teas, 3 miso soups, 1 rice, squid salad, and chicken teriyaki (one of the best!), the total was $38. Can't really complain there.  We'll definitely be back again soon, maybe a little earlier next time."}
{"text":"Awesome tasty sushi, made with tlc. The menu sheet is a Little busy but each roll has its own flavor factor."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's among my favorites on this side of town. I have had really good sushi in my lifetime as I used to live in California, but this place is not bad.   I liked everything we ordered and the service was okay. I would come here again."}
{"text":"If I can give this place 10 stars, I would!  I've been coming here with friends and family since a long time ago when they were named Mr. Sushi. The food is amazing and the staff are so nice and accommodating. It makes me really happy to see the new remodeled space and the unchanging quality of their food and service.   Will be a regular for years and years to come!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! It's pretty much the best sushi to us! We've been going there for 8 years or so now and have never been disappointed in the sushi!  We live a lot further away now but still make it a point to get take out from our favorite sushi place!  It is also the only Sushi place in our area that we know of that makes all your rolls with amazingly light and totally perfect brown rice if you ask them!   And their Japanese Dynamite Salad is out of this world!!  The prices are very reasonable too!  This place does have one drawback however. Whenever we eat in, service tends to be quite slow - often times painfully slow, even though always very friendly! I don't think we've ever been quickly in and out and always had to wait quite a long time for our order to make it to the table.  We generally call ahead with a take out order and just pick it up though, as that works better for us anyway, so it's not much of a problem for us.   But as a dining in experience it might be a little more challenging!"}
{"text":"The sushi here was great! We were on vacation and looking for some sushi. We were glad we happened on this place. The portions were very large, the fish was tasty, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on Friday night with a couple of friends. So let's start with the good things. The menu is super extensive and has a giant variety that you can really choose from. Rolls, ramen, somen, nigiri, etc. The drink menu also offers a lot of beer, wine, and sake as well. The portions are large, particularly for the price.   Now the thing that I really didn't like about this place was the ridiculous wait time for the food. When my friends and I arrived, the place was busy, but definitely not packed or full. We put in an order for 4 rolls (2 of them being vegetarian) and did not even see our food for a good 20-30 minutes. During this entire time, our server did not drop in or check in on us to see if we needed water or anything else. When we finally got the food, it was just so-so. Pretty basic sushi rolls that aren't incredible or spectacular in any way, shape, or form.   I appreciate that they have vegetarian choices including a vegetarian sushi set and vegetarian rolls (avocado/cucumber roll, vegetarian roll, vegetarian tempura roll, super vegetarian roll, etc.), but probably will not return due to the crazy wait time for food."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place! If you think you're coming here to get mediocre sushi, you're wrong! Ok let's get one thing straight -- prices are competitive, and portions are larger than mouth for most of the rolls.  The off-the-menu options are amazing. My favorites range from Caterpillar that is very, very avocado-y in a wonderful, cooling, scrumptious way, Viva Eyda (spicy tuna, shrimp, avocado, cucumber, cream cheese, lemon and sriracha sauce), Letty in Love (similar to Viva Eyda but instead of shrimp, you have fried crap throughout the roll and it's settled in ponzu sauce (garlicky), Mistake (combination of warm and raw fish -- pretty sure it's a mixture of spicy tuna, salmon, and roe) and veggie roll.  This is one of the very few places that does a Las Vegas in an entirely different manner (think deep fried, topped with jalepenos and then settled in ponzu sauce), but it's worth the try! My boyfriend is a fan of the blue flame (deep fried crab and cream cheese roll with a generous drizzle of eel sauce and spicy mayo sauce).  I'm constantly bringing those close to me here because I truly believe you get the best buys here and the best cuts of fish. Some nights are super busy, so be aware that this joint is smaller and wait times may be longer. Just know you will definitely not regret the food portions here!"}
{"text":"Took a date here on a Saturday afternoon. Really nice down-to-earth place with a friendly staff and warm environment. The sushi rolls were BIG, and definitely worth the price. I think they also had happy hour on Saturday as well, since I remember ordering a big beer to go with my sushi.  Definitely would come back here again. I'm not sure how service will be when it's packed, but we were served relatively quickly for our orders."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet! My family has been coming here for years! We love their combination plates, it comes with sooo much and it's not too expensive! We share it between two people and still there are leftovers. We love their hands down the best California rolls in town, and their specialty rolls are good too, just a bit pricy... I would recommend happy hour or reverse happy hour! :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for quite a while.  Went there on a Friday at 4:00 for the happy hour.  First thing I noticed was the remodel, which is nice, but in my opinion it totally ruined the \"charm\" of the restaurant.  Yeah it's nice, but now it looks like every other wannabe trendy sushi restaurant.  Second thing I noticed was the ridiculously loud top forty pop being played.  I couldn't hear the person across from me because Rihanna was blasting so loud!  It was surreal, I felt like I was at a weird club which happened to serve sushi.  The service has gone down as well.  My friend asked for a to-go container of the sauce she had and our server didn't know what she was talking about and came back with salad dressing.  I was getting so frustrated because I couldn't hear a damn thing, and how do you not know what sauce it was?  It was the only sauce that came with our meal.  I finally had to describe what dish we ordered and that we wanted the tempura dipping sauce.  She came back with the sauce and our bill; I wasn't done.  I wanted another beer and my friend wanted to order dessert.  I spent 90 bucks there and won't be back.  Such a shame, the food is alright, but it's such a frustrating dining experience now, just not worth it anymore.  If it's not broken (and it wasn't) then don't fix it.  I suppose they wanted to attract a younger and more \"hip\" crowd, but hello?!?!  The demographic of the area isn't that.  Perhaps it's working though, as we left I saw six half dressed twenty somethings walking in.  This place isn't Ra, and that's why I always liked it.  I hate giving bad reviews, but I spent a lot of money there for subpar food and loud crappy music."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for years.  Always a good experience.  Good quality items with always Fresh tasting sushi.  Newly remodeled to give the restaurant a new modern feel.  Sometimes the service from the sushi counter can be a little slow but that is the only downside."}
{"text":"First time here.  The place got pretty busy during the lunch rush and I think my waitress may have been the only one working, poor lady was literally running everywhere.   We had about 5 rolls and they were super slow to come out.  They do have a ton of choices, almost too many.  Overall the rolls were good, except the Vegas Roll.  They put a jalapeno and hot sauce on it and put it in a jalapeno soup.  It was horrible!  Couldn't believe they called that a Vegas roll.   Outside of that it was average at best.  Prices were good though."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Akaihana, but unfortunately the food is mediocre at best and the service, while friendly, seemed disorganized. I did like that there is a private parking lot with plenty of spaces outside and that the interior was neat and clean.   I came with a party of two for lunch on a weekend, and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were offered a small table for two while other two-people parties were offered larger tables. I didn't mind this at first, but after our dishes came and the table would no longer fit all the plates (the waitress almost knocked a plate off because of how small the table was), we were still not offered a larger table even though there was a four-person one right next to us and the restaurant was still mostly empty. Our waitress was very friendly, so I believe it was more a lack of awareness than ill intent, but it did make the experience less enjoyable. She also accidentally brought us regular coke instead of diet coke and mistakenly added an item we did not order onto the bill while failing to charge us for another item.   Happy hour prices are super worth it for some dishes, but really not for others. We tried three happy hour dishes: fried octopus, fried soft-shell shrimp, and cooked salmon and avocado roll. Out of the three, I would really recommend the cooked salmon and avocado roll because it was a good size, cooked well, and worth the happy hour price. The fried octopus and soft-shell shrimp were less worth the happy hour price, and I definitely wouldn't recommend them normally priced.   Fried octopus: The fried octopus appetizer was very heavily coated in batter and over-fried so that the octopus was very rubbery. I appreciate that this restaurant offers baby octopus, but I had a hard time finishing the dish despite the fact that there were only five little octopi. There was a side salad on the bottom, and I nibbled at some to cut the greasiness of the fried octopus.   Cooked salmon and avocado roll: Like I mentioned above, I was a fan of this roll, especially for the happy hour price. This might be the only roll I would come back for out of all the dishes we ordered. I thought the salmon was nicely cooked, the pairing with avocado was classic, and the roll was flavorful without being smothered in sauce.   Fried soft-shell shrimp: These shrimp were fried in oil that was too hot so that the meat stuck to the shells. It was a good coincidence that the shells were soft and thus could be eaten, otherwise it would've been nearly impossible to peel off the shrimp from the shell. For the price of these, I thought three shrimp skewers was a small portion.   Nadeshiko roll: This roll was on the colored menu, but not on the paper one where orders are marked. I thought that this roll sounded amazing on paper, but in reality it was a textureless glob that really wasn't worth it. The spicy tuna on the inside was so minced that it was like baby food, although it did pack a nice punch of spiciness in flavor. The salmon on top was unevenly seared, and with the soft salmon and soft spicy tuna inside, each bite was a gloopy, soft puddle that I wasn't a fan of.  Arizona Cardinals roll: Another roll that sounded amazing on paper, I think that this roll would've been tasty if the components had been executed properly. Similarly to the octopus and soft-shell shrimp, the soft-shell crab in this roll was over-battered and over-fried. This made the crab completely lose its flavor and become very dry, which wasn't alleviated by the tuna on top because it's a rather lean fish. I did think that the tuna was fresh, but I was confused by the soy-based sauce that came with this roll. It was bland and nondescript, and I much preferred regular wasabi and soy sauce to it for the roll.  I think it's unlikely that I'll be back a second time, but perhaps if I'm in the area I'd take that cooked salmon and avocado roll (at happy hour price) to go.."}
{"text":"Checked this place out because of the reviews and since it was so close to my hotel.   Overall, it was pretty good.  One order of salmon sashimi yielded 5 smallish princes of salmon - fresh but small for $10.  One order of unagi nigiri (2 pieces) came out soaked in eel sauce - way too much sauce. As others have mentioned the sushi rice was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Lastly, I ordered the nabeyaki udon which came out very hot and was very tasty. The noodles were the perfect chewy texture and the pieces of chicken were really yummy. The only complaint I have is that when I got down to the last bit of broth, I bit down on a few small bits of eggshell which made it a not so great experience...but I got down to the bottom of the bowl, so I guess I enjoyed everything else in the pot!   If I'm back in this area, I may come back to try some of their unique rolls."}
{"text":"The place was busy on our way in, which made me hesitant. We ended up getting seated at the bar, which was nice. The menu was overwhelming & We ordered the Antoinette Roll, Crunch Roll & one other special that I forgot the name of. The crunch roll was the best Ive ever had. The Antoinette was a little much for me, it was deepfried, had sourcream & covered in a creamy sauce. Overall great ambience, would go back for the crunch and hand rolls"}
{"text":"I tried this place because I was looking for restaurants close to my house. Even though the sushi is pretty good, the ramen broth was a little weak."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and amazing service. Highly recommend the  Blue Flame roll and the Nadeshiko Roll. OMG NOMNOMNOM"}
{"text":"Last night, I met some friends for all you can eat sushi at Akaihana. It was $24.95 for just about everything on the menu. There were a few items that were not included but believe me, it was only a few. The place was packed as they had been offering this deal all day. It only happens a few times a year, usually around the holidays so you have to be in the know as its not advertised unless you of course frequent this place on a regular. A friend of a friend is a regular customer there so she not only knew all about it, but she even has a roll named after her and they know her by name. (Try the Karen on the menu, its  very good)   It took awhile for our rolls to come out as again it was packed and there were only 3 sushi chef working, but once they started rolling out it was all hands on deck. I don't even remember what I ordered anymore because I was greedy and had way more than I should have. (It was all you can eat you know)  But I do know that the rolls were huge and here were plenty of them. If you check out there menu online its only a small snapshot of the actual sushi menu as its pretty extensive. I will be back to check out their happy hour in the near future."}
{"text":"Came here one evening - accidentally during happy hour - to satisfy a massive sushi craving and was not disappointed! I moved back to Phoenix after a year long stay in Los Angeles (and after finding the best sushi restaurant ever; Toshi Sushi in Silverlake), I was very wary of the sushi here. I tried Ra over in Tempe and thought it was only okay. And, not wanting to drive all the way across the valley for only decent sushi, looked for places closer to the western part of town.   Service was nothing exceptional or memorable, waitress was sweet though. I think next time we'll try sitting at the bar. We ordered quite a variety, most notably the spicy tuna rolls (amaaazing), and a few specialty ones that I can't remember. Definitely good enough to come back, especially with happy hour prices!   It's a little bit hard to find and a little far away from me, but worth it in the end! I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on 3 occassions.  The food is great.  It's kind of one of those hole in the wall sushi places that seems a little cluttered and maybe even a little on the dirty side.  It's really not though.  It's been there for a long time, and I think that character shows.  I say give it a shot.  Great prices and nice friendly service."}
{"text":"Sushi is my favorite food, needless to say I drove all the way from Scottsdale to eat at Akihana. In comparison to the other sushi places I've been to, the prices cannot be beat! We ordered about 8 rolls that day, most on their specialty menu, and I have to say they were quite delicious! Creative too! Their presentation is quite unique! They turn some of the rolls into little character (such as the caterpillar roll).   My favorite thing about this place is that they are not cheap when rolling their rolls! They come packed with fish and goodies and are a more than average size, which is GREAT for the already cheap price you pay and, of course, for your belly!   You can never leave this place hungry!   The location is a bit sketchy, the customer service is good but not great or excellent, and the place inside isn't all that great, but I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this place to anyone! Very tasty and your wallet will love it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing for good sushi. The happy hour after 8 is great and has a lot of options. The blue flame roll is amazing and I will be coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place.  Large, creative sushi menu & complete dinners.  Attractive atmosphere w/ Japanese art & artistically drawn menu ads on the walls.  We've always had good service."}
{"text":"Just as delicious as I remember it! I used to come here when it was Mr. Sushi. Their fish tastes so fresh. My fiancé and I shared some yellowtail sashimi and it basically melted in my mouth. It was amazing! I was so excited to see that they still had the dynamite salad which has various seafood like salmon, tuna, crab and octopus. If you're ordering for just two people definitely get the half order! The half order is pretty big and it can be filling. They have great prices (especially during happy hour) for such great quality sushi. The staff was so nice and it was all around a great experience. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place, in my opinion, has the best sushi in town when it comes to price, taste and quantity. They have great happy hour deals where you can get some rolls half off. Their rolls are some of the biggest in the valley. This is the first time we had been here in a while and  they have totally redone the inside and have even expanded into the suite next to them. If you are by yourself or like sitting and watching them make the sushi, their sushi bar has been expanded and looks excellent.  On this trip we started with the garlic edamame which tasted great. We then ordered the California crunch, blue flame and the Angela. The California crunch is your typical roll but it adds some crunchiness to the outside of the roll. The blue flame is crab, crab stick, avocado and sweet and spicy sauce. It has great taste over all. The Angela had always been my favorite roll at Mr Sushi (its old name). It is straight up delicious. It is deep fried crab salad, cream cheese, jalapeño, baked with cheese and a spicy sauce. It comes out piping hot so you have to wait a bit to eat it. But trust me, it is fabulous. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for a bite to eat, especially during their happy hour."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Highly recommend seaweed salad- super! Rolls are larger here in size than other nearby places to the point where we ended up taking home lots of sushi unexpectedly. Fish was all extremely fresh and served with beautiful presentation. Entire place is clean, chefs and waitstaff courteous and helpful. This is our new favorite. Atmosphere upbeat and fun, will be back to gem!! Who knew something off the i17 freeway exit would be great"}
{"text":"This place used to be called Mr. Sushi. It's been open as long as I've been in Phoneix so going on over 20 years now I am sure.   I'm not sure of the reason for the name change. The new name is difficult to pronounce and even harder to remember. I used to love the Mr. Sushi name- so easy to remember!  Regardless of the name, the place has the same feel and if think the same menu too.   For a reasonable price, you get generous portions of whatever it is that you've ordered. It's a guarantee that you will not leave hungry coming here for lunch or dinner.   I am glad the atmosphere of this place has stayed the same. Warm, friendly and inviting. It's like greeting an old friend when I walk through the doors after not being here for awhile.   Regardless of how many name reincarnations this place goes through, I hope they don't change the atmosphere of the restaurant and this place will always be Mr.  Sushi to me!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite valley sushi spot hands down. Newly remodeled and expanded suite! The fish is fresh, the prices are killer, and it's centrally located right off the I-17 and Northern. Try the spicy yellowtail salad (not on the menu) and lion king roll! They say eel sauce extends your life   Jk I made that up, but it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay Akai Hana or Mr. Sushi? Who gives a crap what the name is, it's not going to stop me from tyring a place because of the name. First thing you should know they have HH EVERYDAY from 4-6pm...om the weekends 3-6. My friend and I checked it out a few months back on a Saturday to see what this place was all about. It was day time, in a strip mall..large windows so I don't know how it could possibly be considered dark if you went in the daytime. Its not a fancy place, it's not a RA or Kyoto..so if you want atmosphere and pretentiousness, yes by all means stay away. For the sushi however...they have the most unique rolls I have encountered thus far in AZ.   ex:  MEXICAN -   Tuna, cucumber and habanero,topped with masago  AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK- Mackerel, tuna,tasmanian abalone, avocado with mango sauce  BUTTER ME UP  -Tuna tempura, avocado,seared salmon, topped with garlic wasabi butter  TODD (Volcano) 15.00  Baked spicy tuna, cucumber,avocado, with shredded crabstick, sits on top of orange,with special sauce and lit on fire   I kid you not.. they have some crazy rolls and we ordered 4.. which included the Butter Me Up listed above. The presentation was phenomenal and so was the food.  We did not experience screaming kids or squeaking fans?? Anyway I was so excited by this find that I sent my boss there and he LOVES sushi. It was him, his wife and their 3 kids (who are very well behaved i might ad). They went for the HH and they loved it. They walked out of there spending less than $50 for the 5 of them..That's numerous appetizers and rolls.  Seriously you can't beat this place for unique rolls and prices. Who cares where it is or what it's name is. This place was freakin fantastic ."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Akaihana. This time I had the Golden Gate Bridge roll (see pic). This was delicious. Its tempura shrimp with cream cheese, scallions, a spicy mix I cant remember the name of, and then topped with yellow tail a slice of jalapeno, and sriracha sauce. Its soooo good. I know some people dont like cream cheese in there rolls I happen to like it a lot, but there are some of the best exotic rolls on the menu I have ever seen. Also I tried the jalapeno poppers to. Not your average poppper but realy good. They came with a smokey sauce and were good for $3.50. HH prices at lunch.  Check this place out! Killer bannana dessert!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sushi place it's right by my house so I go pretty often and their happy hour is absolutely fantastic. They have some beers a little bit of wine all the roles that they have our fresh handmade they greet you right when they walk in the door and everyone is always very friendly. The only downsides to this place would be that the service is a little slow there's usually only about one or two waitresses but all of the cook are rolling sushi rolls fresh by hand so of course that's going to take some time. In my opinion great food for a great price anytime anyone wants to grab sushi this is the first place I always suggest."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and tasty.  Late night happy hour is my favorite time to go.  Great prices and friendly service.   Sometimes the service can be a bit slow.  On one visit with a large group of friends we were placed in the small sectioned-off \"private\" area.  I felt completely abandoned.  The server (male) would FLY in, drop food on the table and FLY out again.  I was REALLY needing a refill on my beverage and missed his \"fly-by\" at least 3 times...finally, I decided to coordinate my entire party in \"grabbing\" his attention in order to request the desired refills.  Whew!    Other than that, the food is great!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Vast menu, with various specials on the walls. It's in your best interest to walk around to each wall to see all the available things because they are not all on the menu. Everything we ordered was delicious. The service was friendly and prompt. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar terrible service.  We were presented with two quail eggs than 10 minutes later 10 pieces of salmon.  We paid our bill and left.  Going to Wild Tuna."}
{"text":"Came here for the sushi, which was great but I made the mistake of ordering the Ramen. The noodles were so over cooked and old that I had a huge clump of hard noodles, resembling a rope. The broth tasted like dishwater and had no complex flavor a at all. This was the worst ramen I ever had, the $.50 packets you get at the store are better."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi place. They also have other lunches besides sushi. I had their eel roll known as an arizona roll and their happy hour menu salmon roll. Their happy hour salmon roll was so inexpensive. It came with 6 maki pieces of salmon and only cost about 3.50. The servers was very polite. Over all great experience. This place os close to hospitals so expect to have a big crowd during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Sushi is great, nice people. The place needs improvement as far as cleanliness goes, the restroom (at least men's) needs repairs and remodeling, and needs to be checked more often."}
{"text":"Ordered three plates of sushi. Tootsie roll, baked scallop roll, and salmon roll. Got full after the scallop roll, I wasn't expecting that. I can say the baked scallop roll is very good and will make you full so be careful not to order too much!"}
{"text":"Omg go here!  For starters, go here during happy hour - I think it goes until 1? Or 2? Go.  Secondly, order as much as you can fit in you. Everything I tried was amazing. Tried a tuna thing, spicy scallop roll, California roll (the crunchy one) and the dragon roll. Omg, it was all so good.  The place was full when we arrived, so is clearly popular. The already good prices are even better during happy hour, so more fish on your dish!  The staff seemed nice enough, if a bit spacey, but the food came out quickly and tasted just delicious.   Have I managed to convey that the sushi here is really good? They may do other stuff...but I have no idea. The sushi is what you need to get here :)  Nom."}
{"text":"It was very busy when we walked in around 5:30 so we sat at the bar for dinner.  We each ordered a sushi roll:  one California roll and one Angela's roll which were very good.  I ordered 2 appetizers:  a cold spinach dish and a cucumber salad.  Both had a very nice ginger undertone and were pretty good for healthy choices.  My only complaint is that at the bar, we were not sure who was waiting on us.  We needed drink refills and to order more food and no one asked us if we needed anything once we got our initial order.  We had to stop the very busy sushi makers to ask for more drinks, more food, etc  ... and I figure if we are spending full dinner prices (our bill was  over $50.00), we should be asked, often, if we are ok and do we need anything.  Otherwise, I'll go back for the food and sit in a regular table."}
{"text":"I'll try to fill in some details later but fresh out of the restaurant I have to say this was a five-star Sushi experience. We had the summer tomato sushi an unusual feature in itself, the Sakura and, well all I have to ask Norm to remind me but that was good too. The portions were unusually large the individual pieces were unusually large, making them a little unwieldy and for slightly messy eating, but all were excellent. At 1:30 on a Sunday I assume we arrived after any lunch time rush, and in any event our weight was not unduly long but given the quantity and quality of the food I think it would have been worth waiting for. Additional compliments on friendly, attentive service. My water glass never stayed empty for long.  Pleasantly full on Sushi. I wasn't sure such a thing was possible. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have loved going to this restaurant for many years but tonight service was absolutely horrible Not only was I set and not seen by anybody for over 10 minutes but after ordering my food and drink at the exact same time we did not receive our drinks until after we received our food once we got our food the chicken was overdone and burnt and the fried California rolls and the regular California rules avocado was Brown and the seaweed tasted bad I have never been so dissatisfied with their service as I have been tonight they were really good until they decided to upgrade and expand and now they can't keep up with expectations one of the worst Services ever"}
{"text":"A year later and a lot of changes happened to this restaurant. Not all of them for the better. Place is bigger, able to accomodate more. They also hired a lot more servers although still as busy so service depends on when you dine. Most importantly, the taste of both their sushi rolls and ala carte specials such as yakisoba and baby squid salad changed. Went back couple of times to make sure but I can no longer reccommend their rolls as the go to sushi even their famous las vegas roll. There just wasnt enough taste for the price. As for their yakisoba, there was a lot less ingredients than before - might as well boil plain noodle with food dye and sprinkle a packet of microwaveable vegetables....yes it was that bare. As for my old favorite baby squid..Taste was spicier and definitely saltier although they did try to mask the difference by adding more fried squid... So disappointed...."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for over 17 years.  I love the food.  They have an incredible happy hour.  Great sushi.  Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I use to be a fan of this place a long time ago.  I was never a fan of sushi, so I always had the vegetable tempura roll(which was phenomenal).  My gf liked the sushi here and decided to stop by again.  My god, they want to absolutely destroy your back.  It's almost like they want you to be completely uncomfortable while you sit.  It's not even uncomfortable for people who have bad posture, it's simply anti-ergonomic.  Someone please tell me when they get rid of the chairs, won't be coming back till then."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  The selection of different sushi rolls is ridiculous. There are three menus and more types posted on all the walls. Waaaaay to many to try in one visit. Plus, they have a half price HAPPY HOUR!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in all the Phoenix area that I have ever been to. They always have new and exciting kinds of rolls and give a good amount of fish for the price and is always fresh tasting. The service and the food are great."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is absolutely incredible! My sister used to work here in high school (I know, I know. Token Caucasian server)- needless to say, I have been coming here a long time. Blue Flame and Super Mussels are unlike anything I have ever eaten! Today I was planning on meeting a friend here and she tried to cancel on me. Because I had been looking forward to it all day and he had given me sushi blue balls, I went before happy hour ended, ordered amazingly-priced rolls and convinced my friend to come meet me. Probably the fattest thing I have ever done but I'm sharing with you to prove a point- the food and the deal here is just THAT worthwhile."}
{"text":"I love sushi, I love local, and I love Happy Hours. Akaihana satisfies all three and I'm there at least once a month. The happy hour menu is excellent and gives you a wide variety of things to order, from Miso Soup or Cucumber Salad for appetizer to sushi and even Saki.  You definitely can fill up on tons of Akaihana goodness on a small budget when you go during happy hour. They make delicious Jalapeno Poppers and I order them every time I'm there. My roll favorites are Tootsi and Rainbow.  The bar area is relatively small, but the table area is definitely spacious. Servers are always friendly and I have had consistently good service there."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed lunch here on several occasions and the meals/sushi have been great. The prices are reasonable and the wait staff are very friendly. It's well worth a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and awesome prices especially during happy hour!  So delicious!  My husband and I love this place, we come here often (as often as we can with a toddler).  Customer service is great too! My husband said 5 stars but I think 4 The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I hate the carpet inside, it makes it not feel clean.  But we really love the sushi/food so I gave it a 5Before I knew about this place I was a regular at Stingray and Ra!"}
{"text":"service is noice! food is noice! sushi is noice! little tip if youre going for the blue flame, get the fried cali roll instead. ;)"}
{"text":"In my quest for new and wonderful places i often forget my old favorites... and i had a harsh reminder of what i have been missing last week.  Don't skip Mr Sushi.  I forgot how wonderfully fresh and delicious their sushi is.  I happened to be driving home the other day on a different route and decided to stop. The place is comfortable and i LOVE the bar.  They have tons of paper signs advertising their hottest and newest creations... the sushi staff are friendly and the patrons usually are as well.  I had a \"bubba gump\"  special.... shrimp, wrapped with shrimp and more shrimp...with shrimp on top.  YUM!  The Caterpillar roll is as good as any i have ever had.  One bite of the Lobster Tempura roll, and i am hooked again.  The sweet lobster flavor sent my senses off on Mr Sushi addiction.  I'm writing this review at 9 am, because if i was writing it during their working hours... i would probably put my computer away, get in the car and have sushi for breakfast.  It was that good.  seriously.  Now that I think about it, I'm probably going there for lunch."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after a few friends have been here.  They have an extensive happy hour menu.  I opted to try spicy tuna hand roll, salmon skin hand roll, salmon puffs (a bit over done), Akaihana Roll (tootsie roll, deep fried), Blue flame roll, & Salmon Kama (collar).  There are not that many places that offer Salmon Kama here in AZ.  This was prepared perfectly with still a lot of tender & moist meat.  Everything I tried was good and off of the happy hour menu.  The place is a good size restaurant with sushi bar seating too.  The server was good and the had the food out in a rather quick fashion, which is nice.  Will definitely come back...especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Came here when it was called Mr. Sushi.  Freshest fish in the valley, LOVE IT.  the rolls are all amazing and the chef specials are usually very creative and yummy.  My favorite is the Sunshine Roll! :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the decor has changed since I was last there, but if not it should. Hand written signs and pictures of food tend to cheapen a place IMO, but the rolls and nigiri are good for a (landlocked state) and priced fair. I've been back a few times with friends if that means anything. IDK, I feel like a grumpy ass today. This review sucks, maybe. Just eat the sushi and ignore me, kk?"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim and was not disappointed. The servers are very helpful when it comes to making a selection on their many rolls and they are very sweet. The Sake bombs are very tasty and the mood lighting makes the feel romantic or chill. I have brought about 6 people here on different occasions and now they are regulars! The rolls are so beautiful, they are Instagram-worthy :)"}
{"text":"I totally don't understand why this place could get more than 3 stars. This place was a total disappointment for me and my husband.  We eat sushi very often. I'm from Japan so I know real good sushi and tend to look for that quality. I also know in Phoenix, it's hard to find 'fresh' fish. But still this place is a total disappointment.  First, it seems like they forgot to season sushi rice. Totally no taste at all which is very odd. For rolls with lots of other stuff and sauce, it could be acceptable but for nigiri with raw fish, it tasted weird. The fish was not fresh at all and we started worrying about getting food poisoning.  Second, we ordered takoyaki (octopus balls) which were deep fried. Takoyaki is a very famous and popular local food in Osaka (where I'm from) so I know what real takoyaki is. I've never seen deep fried takoyaki but can accept it if it's good but they were too oily.  And the service was below average too. The waitress did not repeat our order and she forgot one of the items we ordered.. The appetizer came fast but after that we waited 20-30mins. They were friendly, though.   They seem to have many kinds of rolls so if you like rolls and they don't forget to season the rice or you don't mind plain rice, you still could enjoy this place. But the overall quality of the food is low especially compared with other Japanese restaurants like Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe, Shimogamo, etc.  I don't see any point to go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was recently in Phoenix on business and tried Akia Hana.  They have a huge variety of custom rolls and their happy hour deals are great.  I ended up eating there several times during my trip and if I return to Phoenix, I will be back.  The staff is cheerful, the bar is clean and my food was fantastic."}
{"text":"I like rolls. I like rolls that are primarily fish, rice and veg. I don't like rolls that are more cream cheese/mayo/tempurawhatever than actual ingredients. I get it - crab salad implies mayo most of the time, but how about just a dab to bind it? I could not even tell which roll was crab, which was shrimp, and which was scallop because of mayo overload. I also hate when I can't finish off a piece of a roll in one bite. Seriously, this is the most mayo-ridden, overly huge maki I have ever experienced. The happy hour prices are tempting, but you would be better off at Kona or Sekana.  If you are more of a sashimi person, then maybe skip over this review, but I wont be back to try anything else here."}
{"text":"It's wonderful to see a independent business run such a great establishment. The service is always wonderful. The food is always great and every so often they surprise you with a new creative dish that greatly surprises and satisfies.   Keep it up folks."}
{"text":"So the place goes by a couple names, Its also known as Mr. Sushi. So when you are trying to find it, just look for the Marie Calendars, turn into that parking lot and then drive straight back to the little hidden strip mall area. The sign on the building says Akaihana, The sign on the window says Mr. Sushi....A bit confusing.   We got there at about 6pm last night. There were a few tables seated but it was pretty dead. We got seated right away and placed a drink order.   They have a pretty large menu and offer a TON of sushi. We placed our order and had everything in about 20 minute. Pretty fast.   Now, Like I said in my Roka Akor review...I am not a sushi girl, AT ALL. So I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner. It was tasty. I did sneak a couple pieces of sushi to see if I liked it.   The soft shell crab roll was gross. I was not a fan, it had a real fishy flavor to it. ACK!   On the other hand, the tempura fried shrimp roll was YUMMO!   I did not eat the other stuff, there was a spicy tuna roll and some other something that the hubs ordered.   By the time we left (8pm) the place had filled up. It looked like there was only one waitress, but she was running her ass off and doing a good job at keeping everyone happy.   I would go back here if someone said they wanted to go, but its not on my list of must go to places.   Give it a try."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing! Looks like my husband and I have found a new spot!! Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Tried a new place. The prices were nice and the sushi was amazing! We ordered the California roll, the California Crunch roll and the Asparagus roll. Tried all 3 and have to say the crunch roll was the best. I cannot have cucumber so they were very nice about my special order. No dirty looks like I usually get. The asparagus roll was ok....wish it had more to it then just asparagus...like tempura or some cream cheese, but it still was well made.  Will be here again."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi thats affordable for many who can't eat sushi! I just love how there are real japanese chefs! For tuna lovers try their spicy tuna crackers, six shooter, and karpaccio! I definitely love their spicy tuna crackers! Also, try their Japanese Dynamite Salad! It tastes amazing! Their menu is huge and lots of variety to pick from compared to other places as well."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Phoenix!  My favorite is the Spicy Tuna hand roll.  I get it every time. It gets packed during the rush, so go during happy hour or lunch and you will get great specials and great service."}
{"text":"I ordered the following rolls: rainbow, island, cucumber, and special salmon. The island roll was my favorite, but they were all phenomenal.   I eat a lot of sushi...in a lot of different cities across the US...this place was among the best.   The exterior may make you skeptical, but the sushi is great! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is the best. The food is presented beautifully and tastes delicious. Not to mention the happy hour is spectacular. For $27 we got 4 big sushi rolls, a chicken teriyaki appetizer, and two miso soups! It's incredible. And the service is perfect. I could not come here often enough, will always crave more!"}
{"text":"This location has had a couple of different named Japanese restaurants. The current iteration is decent but basically average, nothing remarkable. The Chef is Japanese American, decent skills but pretty quiet."}
{"text":"Always great! Best bang for your sushi buck!!! Not a pretentious crowd is a plus! Becoming our favorite."}
{"text":"Great variety of sushi, friendly and fast service, large pieces of squid for calamari, slightly pricey but large portion sizes.  Unique items like frog legs, garlic clams and more! Located in an otherwise empty strip mall, but this place was full on a Friday night.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Okay I have been going to \"Mr. Sushi\" for many years and it is always the same thing - GREAT Sushi - BUT, the service is the worst! I cannot think of a worse group of people trying to act as wait staff. There is not a single individual on the that has an ounce of intelligence. You might as well go into the kitchen to pick up your food. FYI. mathematical skills are nonexistent! Do not expect a bill, unless you are will wait and wait and then go up and get it yourself. There is too much competition in PHoenix to tolerate this level of performance. Good bye Mr. Sushi, hello Hana (If we can ever get in)"}
{"text":"First time here, and I must say I will for sure be back! The amount of food you get for the price you pay is amazing. Their menu has so many options, everything you can imagine. I had the Tropicana roll which is salmon and mango super good and the Alexa go go---- fire! The Alexa Go go was so fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Good food, but we went there for dinner and ordered two appetizers, shumai and grilled yellow tail collar. It was a long wait and our dinners came out before either appetizer. We declined the shumai. Then, I went to use the restroom and BOTH the mens and ladies rooms were out of order. They said someone was coming to fix them \"soon\".  Completely unacceptable to have no working restroom at prime dinner hour!"}
{"text":"It has great reviews, but I just found this place... okay. It's located in a little center that looks completely new... yet abandoned. There were only a couple of cars in the parking lot right next to this place. The interior feels old even though the exterior looks new. There's a bar and a few tables. It is the kind of restaurant where you pay at the cashier/hostess stand, which is located to the left when you walk in. They sell little trinkets and stuff inside and on the cashier/hostess stand - like lollipops and decorations. There are photographs everywhere of customers. Seriously. Everywhere! Half of the menu is pasted on the walls on pieces of paper. I'm not even kidding. It looks the employees made up rolls, and instead of adding new items to the actual menu, they drew on paper like elementary school children. Some of them are ripped and falling apart. I think it takes away from the seriousness of being an actual business. I ordered jalapeño tempura and a shrimp tempura roll. There was a lady sitting next to me, and I noticed they gave one of my rolls (the jalapeño tempura) to her. I could tell. They quickly took it away and told her they messed up. The guy hid it behind the bar, and then, he handed it to me after a couple minutes. Really?! Thank goodness I noticed that the lady hadn't touched it. Otherwise, I would've totally asked for a remake. Instead, I kept my mouth shut. It was okay. It probably would've been a lot better if I got it fresh. The shrimp tempura roll was just okay as well. I'm sorry. I just didn't enjoy my experience very much here."}
{"text":"Okay, I LOVE this sushi restaurant.   The number of rolls were awesome, the food was fresh and well made when it came out. They had TORO (fatty tuna) at a GREAT price. ::Sigh:: Memories.  I will say we ended up going for a Saturday evening and it seems our waitress forgot about us, because another one had to come take care of us the rest of the night, even though the other waitress was still there?  Normally I would have knocked it down to a four star, but the Toro was so clean and at such a good price, I had some spine tingling moments with my favorite food of all time.   Please work on the service (I know it's a busy night but you should know that going in), but Chef's keep up the amazingness. : )"}
{"text":"This sushi spot is a pretty awesome little jewel. It is tucked away off of the highway frontage of I-17 and Northern. We arrived just before the 8PM Happy Hour started and boy was this place packed. At first we were not sure we were going to stay but we walked inside and saw how packed it was and saw large platters of sushi going out to every table. We were sold! This place is not in the best of neighborhoods so we were a little skeptical, especially of sushi. However, we were pleasantly surprised. We got the Aloha roll (which was a bit fishy tasting), the Hollywood roll which was my fav, teriyaki chicken and rice for the kiddo (which was excellent), a sushi and sashimi (raw slices of various fish and octopus) sampler platter, a la carte yellowtail belly meat sashimi (which is my all-time favorite cut of sushi) and it was a high quality and done right here (to give the melt-in-your mouth effect). We also had a roll that had predominately fried elements to it which was the bf's favorite. For dessert, they had cheesecake tempura that I had to try because it sounded interesting and I've never had that before. This was our least liked dish. We would never get it again because there were ice chunks in the middle of the cake and it taste like frozen cheesecake from the box with tempura on in a flashed in the fryer, with strawberries on the side then drizzled chocolate syrup. 2 rounds of saki-bombs were fun as well.  Overall the price was great and the food was really good. This will be one of my new Happy Hour spots."}
{"text":"As always the sushi here was amazing. Everything is served fresh. Even on a busy Friday night we were able to get a table immediately. I need to come here more often."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and their food and prices are excellent. But what has ALWAYS been a gripe of mine is their service! Most of the time you have to flag someone down. But what's the worst, and happens all the time, is when one or two people don't get their food forever - Well after everyone else does! Even when it's just my daughter and me, for some reason they decide to do half the page and ALWAYS neglect hers! We have waited so long for her food that I actually had to stop eating mine to wait or I would have been completely done. They need to learn restaurant etiquette- do not serve the table until the whole table's food is ready. It's uncomfortable and frankly embarrassing asking everyone else to please eat while you wait and wait and wait for your food."}
{"text":"This place is currently under renovations, but has yummy sushi and great happy hour! Sometimes the rolls are a little loosely wrapped which can get a tad messy to eat, but it's so delicious, we never really mind!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Akaihana (Mr Sushi) for over 13 years now and the quality is always excellent. They have an extensive selection and the service and atmosphere are wonderful. I drive out of my way monthly just to get my sushi fix from Akaihana. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Don't really know where to start? the Sensei Salad was horrible and not fresh-looks like a can salad(see my photo) ,the sashimi tomatoes tasted like lemon dish soap,spicy tuna was okay and the veggie roll was decent,Garlic edamame is a joke! they just put GARLIC SALT on it and that's it(see my photo). The restaurant was super dirty and no one pick up the plates from our table so we can have more space for the upcoming food(see my photo("}
{"text":"Boy, the reviews are all over the place for this one!  I can only comment on my experience which was pleasant.  I had the lunch special and it was fresh and tasty.  I like the place and will probably go back.  We sat at the sushi bar and the chef knew my friend who I was eating lunch with.  He even had a special roll for her as she frequents Akaihana.  It was all good."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour! It's a great time to try many different items on the menu. We went a little crazy and ordered way too much, but it was quite good. I liked the kodiak, California crunch, and the blue flame rolls. All were very flavorful and done well. I didn't care for the tempura roll as it was too bland."}
{"text":"We have been going to Mr.Sushi for well over 10 years.  LOVE IT!  There sushi chef's and staff are awesome! We tried other sushi restaurants and always come back here!  and Happy Hour is awesome!"}
{"text":"Been driving past this place for the longest time and never noticed it before I yelped it! Happy we found this hidden gem! The service was wonderful and it gets packed later on at night! There was a wide selection of food and beverages and we enjoyed our meal very much!!!! Everything was fantastic, I just wished our food came a bit faster!"}
{"text":"I came here several times. I was very happy with the quality and service here at first. Then, I came here and ordered the dynamite salad to go. When I came back to my place and opened the box, there was several sliced tiny tuna and salmon piece with a LOT of cucumber. It was basically cucumber salad. So disappointed. I'd want to believe the cook who prepared my salad was brand new, first day of work. But, most likely there would have been a supervisor. If that is the quality of take out, I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Came as part of a big group, don't think one server was quite enough but she was a trooper. Food came out way quicker than I thought it would and was not too shabby, perhaps a little pricey for what we got but not that big of a deterrent. The Mexican Roll is a slice of Hell in your mouth (not necessarily a bad thing) and honestly, their Baked Scallop/Dynamite/'whatever it's called in your neck of the woods' Roll is the best one I've EVER had. Very generous with the scallops and surimi and the roll still didn't disintegrate under the weight of the baked goodness. The GF wasn't a fan but we will try it again for happy hour, minus the large group."}
{"text":"This place can get busy really quickly, not just because of the size of their dining area, but because people just keep flocking to get their sushi and Japanese food fill. When I say fill, I actually mean it. Their portions are glorious, the taste is fresh and the textures are wonderful. The only issue is that it can take a while to get said amazing food to the table, specially at lunch, when time is of the essence. So instead of blaming them for how popular they are locally, I'd advice you to take a long lunch instead and kick back and order the fried cheesecake and just have a really great time."}
{"text":"Ended up stopping here on our way home from Glumdale. Just happened to see it while passing by and I'm glad we did! Even though it was just 11:30, as we approached, we noticed it was already getting busy. That's a good sign in my book. Interior is nothing fancy, just functional. Staff was friendly, fast and efficient in every way. My son had the Udon and sashimi and I opted for the tempura lunch special and Nigiri. Couldn't be more pleased with our meal. Prices were reasonable, sushi and Nigiri were fresh and not a problem did we encounter. We will be back! Thanks Guys!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with co-workers yesterday for the second time. Fresh, delicious, and during happy hour very reasonably priced with large portions.  The tempura is great and so is the teriyaki chicken. The fried California roll is very good and my lunch mates really like the Crazy and Rainbow rolls.  YUM!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Mr. Sushi for about 15 years and we have loved it and recommended it for all those years.  However I'm ready to move my sushi loyalty if I can find the right place.  Mr. Sushi's food is still great and the prices are OK but the experience has taken a nose dive because we can never get a seat at the sushi bar anymore.  They have dedicated half of the sushi bar to a waitress service area and they never seat people efficiently at the sushi bar so our party of three is always bumped to a table even if three different chairs spread out across the bar are open.  We lose the conversation with the sushi chef, the conversation with other sushi lovers, the motivation to try new sushi and fast service.  They need to get their 'sushi' together before they lose long time customers like us."}
{"text":"More expensive than it is worth, the food is good but not outstanding and not different than other less expensive places.  Shop around a bit before you go here unless you think your date is impressed by inflated prices."}
{"text":"Delicious! Also received sample cocktails from Sonya (or Sonia), which were also good and awesome to discuss what we liked about them. She was very receptive to our feedback. Also, regulars were greeted and they were greeted back by name. The staff also seemed friendly, particularly Steve. We had the California Crunch, Blue Flame and Crazy with no complaints. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi restaurant ever! Don't come here! I used to go almost weekly but the sushi has gone down hill. I even branched out and got different items to see if maybe it was what I usually order, The California roll but no. The cucumber salad is nasty and has no sauce. The spinach peanut salad is horrible. The miso soup doesn't have hardly any tofu or spinach. The soda is horrible tasting."}
{"text":"Just Awesome, we live in California and eat sushi often. We had a sea bass sashimi dish to die for, they seared it with boiling olive oil, what a treat, the aloha roll was incredible also. We have bookmarked this place for future reference thank you Shawn for making our experience incredible."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a decent place for inexpensive Japanese food, but you'll have to endure questionable service and a landmine of unsavory rolls on the menu on your way to a satisfying dinner. Also, show up early. If you wanna eat at 9, be there before 8. It gets PACKED. They close at 10.   I arrived around 8:30 and was understandably told to wait. At about 9 I was seated, and we ordered appetizers. The entire time, I was gawking at the menu like \"OMG I can order like 3 different things this is so cheap\". I ordered the terriyaki chicken as an app. It was freaking delicious, and came out in less than 10 minutes. My dining companion and I ordered 3 rolls between us. They are, on average, about $7 each for some decent stuff.   Only problem is that it took a bit over half an hour to arrive! WTF?   The hana roll was beautiful and tasty, with the multiple varieties of fish. Unfortunately, they fell apart rather easily, even for something so large it was cumbersome to enjoy with chopsticks. I still approve. The tootsie roll was not exactly what I was expecting. Didn't realize that all the contents would be cooked, and thought it was weird that there were tempura batter bits mixed throughout the rice. As for the tropicana roll, mango and salmon sounded lovely, but I didn't realize there would be excessive globs of mayonnaise on top of it.   I feel as though the menu does not accurately describe what you're signing up for, and that can result in disappointment.   In the end, I barely had time to take a couple of bites before a server dropped off a check. They were adamant about getting us out ASAP despite being patient with them. It's hard to knock a sushi place that's offering such great deals, but it really pushes my limits of how much questionable service I can put up with before I ding you. I really want to drop this to a 3, but I just can't. You were too easy on my wallet."}
{"text":"This place used to have decent sushi. I came here for the first time in over 4 years! Obviously a lot has changed within these few years.   They're renovating this place which looks nice so far. The happy hour menu is pretty ridiculous because there's just a lot of appetizers and sushi rolls you can choose from.   The portion size of these rolls are great! The only downside about this place is that you can tell they use cheap fish just by the taste and looks of it.   If you're okay with it and want cheap food than this is the spot! If you want better quality sushi than check out other restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite sushi place, and we have been coming here for years. They have an excellent and affordable menu (especially during happy hour). We love the spicy tuna rolls on the happy hour menu. If you want some extra heat ask for them to add jalapeño or even habanero if you're brave! My personal favorite roll is the Rose Royce. This is very hot (it has habanero)! The roll has this incredible umami flavor though if you can take the heat! It includes a spicy tuna roll with habanero, topped with avocado, raw salmon, a lemon wedge (the best part) and sriracha. We never leave there without it. Other items that I highly recommend are: the cucumber salad, the gyozas, Kanpai Carpaccio #1, and the fried spicy chicken appetizer."}
{"text":"Did I eat at the correct Akaihana? Because based off the reviews, it seems like I had a completely different experience here that was hardly passable in my book.  Akaihana advertised a happy hour and had deals for apps, sushi rolls and alcohol, plus it was cheap, but I guess some things are too good to be true. I stepped into Akaihana and was greeted by the sushi chef in some kind of indistinct Asian language, I'm used to the \"Irasshaimase\" greeting as I used to serve at a Japanese restaurant in the past. However, I could not make out what language he was speaking. Regardless, I was seated in the corner of the restaurant and was given 3 menus.  Since I was sharing dinner, the items that were ordered were: Tootsie Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, Tropicana Roll  -Tootsie Roll: deep fried salmon surrounding imitation crab meat, big roll and served with a soy-based sauce -Spicy Salmon Roll: chopped up salmon mixed with spicy sauce in a roll, this is nothing special. Spicy salmon does not work in my book, spicy tuna does though.  - Tropicana Roll: Salmon with mango, each piece topped with spicy mayo and sriracha and more soy-based sauce  This place masks the quality of their fish with sauces, deep frying and rice portion. The portion of rice was overwhelming in comparison to the rest of the fish in the rolls and wasn't seasoned well and hard, the sauces overtake your tastebuds not allowing you to taste the fish. The ginger was very sweet and I didn't even dare try the wasabi.  Cheap prices are reflected in their quality of rolls,: over sauced, too much rice and lacking in quality of fish. Interior is a bit crazy with variety of menu choices and service is decent at most. Also upon leaving, the sushi chef greeted me once again in some indistinct (made up sounding) language which I found to be a bit offensive. Because I know for a fact he was not speaking Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or Filipino because I've worked and frequent Japanese and Korean restaurants/have friends who are and that I am both Vietnamese and Filipino.  *Pass on this place, I got a stomach ache the whole night after dining in here."}
{"text":"I can't for life of me understand how people give this place 4 and 5 star ratings. They've obviously never had any quality sushi.  The food is not good, fish is not fresh or of a high quality, rice is not properly cooked and if you get anything out of the deep fryer (tempura, etc.) you can taste their nasty, dirty cooking oil. They serve ranch dressing with the salad that comes with entrees. Ranch?? At a \"Japanese\" restaurant?? If you order chicken katsu, as I unfortunately have, it comes out looking like a child cut it up. Service is S-L-O-W!  We've been here twice and never again."}
{"text":"Mr. Sushi ... The restaurant has change a couple of different owner ever since i land my footstep here in Arizona (since '99).  It seems to be a decent place when you have a sudden urge to have sushi. It's also a great place for those out there that want to try sushi for the first time.   There are abundant of rolls ...enough to start their own sushi roll wiki and too many for my taste bud. I usually prefer sashimi. The fish quality is pretty good. Most of the dishes is not quite pricey and they have plenty of choices to go around that will feed everyone in the family including the kids.   Some of the rolls here is better than Zen 32 in Scottsdale, which is more $$$$.. Anyway it's a different enviroment that cater to different crowds."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday that my friends set up as a surprise party. The staff worked very hard to ensure we were well taken care of. The food was even better. It's very rare to ever fine a sushi restaurant in Arizona that compares to the sushi in my hometown of Las Vegas but this is definitely the same caliber. This is an excellent place to eat and enjoy yourself.   Tl;dr: The food is excellent and the service is too."}
{"text":"We gave this restaurant four stars simply because we are tough graders.  The sushi rolls were great, creative, and HUGE.  The service was fine, and the atmosphere was great.  My lady would like to add that the temperature here was pleasant as opposed to the subzero temperatures that is usually coupled with sushi bars.  We got the Paul (Our Favorite), Crazy (also good), Crunch, Godzilla, and Las Vegas(wasn't a huge fan of) rolls.  The rolls were decently priced, the only regret we have is trying to eat 5 rolls (due to our ignorance of the portion size).  Over all, it is agreed among the  three of us that it was a pleasant experience and we would come back."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is worth the find. Located just off the I17 in the nearly-deserted strip mall on the northeast side, Akaihana sushi & grill used to be a different name. The signs are still up for the old name but Akaihana is painted on too.  Nice place with tinted windows to block the direct intense AZ sun and plenty of seating. Huge sushi bar with flashy sushi chef wearing a sequins-encrusted NYC hat - greets you when you walk in. We were seated at a table in the main area. The waitress was experienced but more into chatting than serving. She knew the menu and details of the rolls. She was very helpful, when you could catch her. She liked to drop and run. For a place that wasn't very busy either. Happy hour menu is extensive but full of the regular rolls that aren't very interesting. Which is fine, if the full price items are quality - which happily they were. The rolls are huge. We ordered way too much food. For 3 of us, with wine, was $70.  We took more than half home and had it for later. I wouldn't call this a place you could get a quick meal but I would definitely visit here again.    Garlic edamame sounds good, but don't bother - get plain. It's just garlic powder dusted on the shells then microwaved. Gyoza is good with a spicy dipping sauce. The salmon roll with the lemon slice was choice: Lety in love. Kodiak and Blue Flame were choice. Don't get the Tempura roll - just order the shrimp tempura appetizer. It's so much better."}
{"text":"The sushi is ok. My wife had a vegetarian bento box which she liked. Absolutely not for kids unless they like rolls or dark meat.  We orderd a side of steamed vegetables whic was only squash and eggplant. Same with the veggie tempua, it was only eggplant. The side salad included with each meal was very clearly bagged or just wilted from sitting open too long. The good news is the draft beer was good. When we got our check ot was off and we had yo have it fixed and the dishes came out in no order. My family was done eating before I got my spicy tuna roll. The wasabi was discolored like it had been sitting out. We might come back with out the kids or just try and find another close place for sushi."}
{"text":"Went here after doing some shopping at the Dillard's across the way. I saw this place has copious reviews and overall a great rating so we decided to try.   Note - the location of this place is odd! You have to take the frontage road one way to access. We missed the turn and then had to make a loop around again since it's a one way. Beware. Not noticeable from street view!   This place was crowded in a good way which led me to believe its popular. I got shrimp spring rolls (just ok- wouldn't Re-order) and a spicy tuna roll which was very good! My friend got the sushi combo which was $13.50 for an insane amount of food + soup and salad. Service was okay. Food was worth the price. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Really really good! We came in during happy hour and they have decent prices.  We ordered the Tropicana Roll, Spicy Tuna, Crazy Roll, Baby Squid, Tempura and Ramen.  Everything was good but not out of this world good.  The rice was a little too sweet for my liking.  The ramen was missing the egg but had good texture to the noodles and the pork was very tender.  The Baby Squid came on a bed of lettuce and it was cooked perfectly!  Tempura wasn't that grand, kind of small for the happy hour - I don't see the deal in cost.    Would I come back?  Yes for sure!  I'll try other items next time...  their sushi menu is pretty extensive and you'll have to come back many times to get through it all."}
{"text":"Been there lots of times!  It's alright for what it is.  Imitaion crab filling for many of the recipes.  Atmosphere is fine - no music, just sports on a TV - not my thing.09-.  Always friendly.  Clean enough.  Fish  is fresh enough.  Generous enough.  Price is alright.  Never bad, just never outstanding.  Glad they are here because NOTHING in this area is acceptable, especially Koi."}
{"text":"I usually love this place...My favorite roll is the butter me up roll.  I love the garlic butter that they melt over the roll and how they torch the outside. Unfortunately this time (actually the last TWO) I felt they hardly had any of the best part! I wished that they had torched the outside a little more. That bummed me out!"}
{"text":"I love love love Mr. Sushi. I'm all about sushi, and make it at home quite often. I'd venture to say Mr. Sushi has some of the best sushi in Phoenix. It's cheap, while the service kinda sucks sometimes, it's worth the price. Try one of their MANY unique rolls. I love the baked scallop roll, the Tokyo, and the Las Vegas. Mmm!"}
{"text":"They've got more rolls than a donut shop! (Sushi rolls that is) They've got great staff! I am a purist when it comes to my fish, so simple is key for me. The simple things I ordered were fantastic, and everyone around me who was ordering complex roll after roll looked as pleased as I did!  I'm going back, I think tonight!"}
{"text":"Apparently there are 2 names to this place. Clearly the marketing in that was well thought out....  re-posting what I already wrote---  I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch. If that wasn't enough to stop making you eat here... I'll list some more reasons-  Agadashi tofu was more like watered down teriyaki sauce with a side of tofu mush.  Tempura with no tempura sauce, and it tasted old.  Waitress dropped an entire tray of ice water on my mom and didn't even apologize.  The best part was the table behind us with young children screaming... while the parentals were sake bombing like 18 year olds.  Clearly... a classy place if you ask me.  BTW, if you honestly give this place more than 3 stars, I really question your taste palate."}
{"text":"Sushi was absolutely delicious. They have an expansive menu and everything we ordered was spot on. From the salmon skin roll  (crunchy and savory) to the the mistake roll (stuffed with yummy goodies), it was all nummy and the prices were more than reasonable. If my review were only based on food, it would easily be 5 stars. However, the food isn't the only element to consider. What makes this a 3-star experience is having to argue with my waiter about the amount of food we ordered. There were three of us and we were hungry. We have no issues putting away some food and we know what we can eat. So having the waiter come to us and say \"No, this is too much food. You order too much.\" And he repeated this multiple times as we told him, \"No, this is our order. We know what we ordered.\" After he repeatedly let us know that we ordered too much, I asked him, \"Are you honestly telling us what we can order?\" And he replied, \"Yes, it's too much.\" Seriously? I then said that this was our order and if he didn't like it we can leave. He finally took our order and walked away. During our meal we had to ask another waiter for drinks as ours were never refilled. I guess he was just mad that we ordered too much?   If I do come back, I'll have to ask for a different waiter. Maybe then I'll be able to actually enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"This place is ok, were in town on vacation and were craving sushi. Please do your research and review more places. The service wasn't the best but our waitress was good, the sushi wasn't the greatest it was just...okay! Never time I'm in down i will definitely not come by again, but it's okay for you're in a hurry and just wanna some sushi it isn't horrible but always isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Finally found another sushi place that's good! After our chef left its been a big struggle. Rolls are HUGE and taste great."}
{"text":"This place has a bunch of it's own specialty rolls that are awesome!  Staff is great and remembers its regulars.  Will be back"}
{"text":"this place is amazing....one night my friend and i were looking for a sushi spot, the first 2 spots were closed and then we googled and found 'mr.sushi' which sounded frightening. We decided to try it anyways and it was AMAZING!!!!! we got there later on in the evening, which ended up being awesome since it was happy hour.  the food was amazing, i'm from the bay area and have had some amazing fresh sushi, this place was just as good if not better. The amount that you get for the price is awesome. the food is delicious and extremely flavorful.  i recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with their service, so friendly and absolutely pleased to find such a wide creative variety of rolls they made.  The list was very long and took me a while to decide what to get.  Having tried 3: the Manhattan roll, Aloha roll, and Alaskan roll all were pretty good not one was a disappointment, although its hard to mess up sushi, I've had pretty boring flavorless ones before but theirs was far from it.  My sister also ordered an entree and her portion was huge, they definitely weren't stingy. You would definitely be full if you ordered their dinner entrees.   This place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We have grown to really like this place. I am still a little concerned that they block off half the bar on nights land then it's packed and then we have to wait 20 minutes with tons of open tables...however...the food is amazing. The staff is super nice and very helpful. I haven't had better sushi in the valley, it's truly fresh and very generous in portions. My family has eaten there three times now. I am glad we live so close - it's a quick drive and a great place to enjoy a celebration meal. Sushi is still a tad on the expensive side :-)"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix hands down. Yellowtail sashimi was fresh and yummy. They have real green tea hot or cold. The rolls are great and the prices are exceptional."}
{"text":"Very attentive and pleasant staff. Doesn't look busy from the outside but was full of people when we visited during the week for lunch. They have happy hour special and more choices than you could ever want. I got the vegetarian combo plate and my brother got the number 8 combo. I could barely finish it was so filling. Sushi and tempura veggies are great. Can't wait to go again and try something different."}
{"text":"I sampled this menu quite extensively within the past six months, and I can say that I've never had a bad roll from here. My favorites are the baked scallop and the Annie Oakley rolls. The udonhere is good as well, the servings are large and are priced very well. I've only been dissatisfied with their pork katsu, just a bit over cooked. Overall this is a very good restaurant with gracious staff and good food."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi joint ever (so far)!  Do yourself a favor and get the Paul Roll...there is nothing like it.  The Surf 'n Turf roll is also worth checking out, and the Shiitake Tempura is pretty darn amazing.  I've never had anything bad here, except the Miso soup...not a fan.  Other than that, great place.  Lunch time gets busy, so either get there at 11:30 or get there at 1:00.  Anytime in between is going to be packed and they will be slower in serving you.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last night and I ABSOLUTELY loved it! They have LOTS of vegan/vegetarian options, which is awesome! Even more awesome, they offer Tamari soy sauce! This soy sauce is gluten-free, organic, and non-gmo project verified. I honestly didn't expect for them to have this option but I thought I'd ask anyways, and they did.   Wooohooo!!!  I am so excited to go back, it's very clean and comfortable inside too! Their prices are great! What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in phoenix! I have been here three times and each time it has gotten better and better. Small restaurant located in a strip mall. Everything I have tried has been fantastic! All the way from beginner to advanced sushi eaters this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"The far best delicious sushi happy hour ever! Amazing place! I try to come here about once a week after I workout, its because you know...I gotta grow! But seriously amazing happy hour! I was there last night with a buddy and they got a picture of me because its was my birthday! So look for my picture on the wall! I got a special place on the wall ;)"}
{"text":"Liked  it a lot , nice small place , with a good sushi and other fun items, not to pricy , but for last 2 times service wasn't as good as before, and my stomach didn't agree with my food. So stopped going there , been going to K- sushi lately."}
{"text":"This place has really changed. The quality of service, and the quality of food has really slipped."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT ,I LOVE IT!    If you want off the wall, weirdly fantastic, never could have dreamed of rolls, this is the place to come. I have never seen rolls as BIG or as tasty. Its a little expensive but you get for what you pay for, the rolls are HUGE.   some of my favorite: GODZILLA ROLL, NIXON ROLL, BAKED SCALLOP ROLL  Staff is extremely friendly and wonderful. Its always busy, but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"The blue flame is probably one of their best rolls! They are to die for. Love this place. But I go to the one in Goodyear"}
{"text":"Awesome! We came during happy hour and everything was reasonably priced, especially drinks! It was pretty busy (Saturday night during happy hour), but our food still arrived in a timely manner. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend has been coming here since he was a kid and now he has me hooked. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great staff. Great service. Amazing sushi!"}
{"text":"Akaihana is located in a Shopping plaza in a section sorta by itself right of Northern.  Appears they are remodeling or just did to expand.    Sat at the Sushi Bar and chef he was super nice and helpful.   This has to be the best Las Vegas Roll I've had honestly, prefect in taste.  Now it does marinate in a jalapeño sauce that hits you towards the end of the roll.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Top 3 favorite sushi joints in Phoenix - might even be number 1. Their quality is consistently excellent, even when ordering takeout. They have many other options if you're not into fish (yakitori chicken, teriyaki chicken, steak, etc). Their rolls are excellent. If you like mussels, try the super mussels. So good!"}
{"text":"Good food!  I could stand for slightly friendlier service!  I went to lunch and they made me feel a bit rushed to so they could close.  I came back to try dinner and when I walked in there girl at the front desk didn't even greet me!  Table side service was good!  I will go back!"}
{"text":"Ive been here for years! i love ittttttttt. Hands down the best sushi everrr!!!  Hole in the wall...? Yes. Yes it is. But this is the only place I go for amazing sushi!!!!!!!!!!!  Happy hour starts at 8pm Whooo. I always get the vegetarian blue flame. It's so delicious. Love the sweet sauce they sprinkle in.  They don't speak English well...but it works out some how. Ahha.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch (finally) after a very long time of wanting to come here. The yelp reviews were so good I just had to try it. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and taken to a nice table. I was then given three different menus of which I looked over and over because there were so many options. I finally decided on the Lunch Box Special ($8) the sushi appetizer ($6) and the Tropicana Roll ($5) They first brought out the miso soup included in the bento, which was good, with tofu, seaweed, and some green onions. Shortly after, my sushi appetizer followed. Just looking at the appetizer I knew that it was good quality. Each bite confirmed this. The appetizer was one piece shrimp, one piece white fish, one piece tuna, and one piece salmon. All were amazing and melted in mouth. Then the Tropicana roll arrived. Wow. I almost didn't want to touch the plate because of the beautiful display that was sitting in front of me. Salmon and mango inside the roll and was served with sweet mayo which was REALLY good. It also comes with siracha but I requested it without. I didn't think that mango in a roll would make a lot of sense but it was amazing. Then my bento came. A little bit of chicken teriyaki in good sauce, various veggies and one shrimp tempura which were all done nicely, There was a nice big bowl of rice, There was also a nice salad, and a California roll. The CA roll was a bit meh but the rest was pretty good. I was stuffed... most likely will just the sushi appetizer and a couple rolls."}
{"text":"Try the soft-shell crab roll. Great sushi and Japanese food at affordable prices. The Blue Flame is awesome and they have great \"happy hour\" specials."}
{"text":"So I came here after hearing rave reviews from friends. The first time I made it over, I waited in the unwelcoming \"lobby\" for 15 minutes with servers scooching past without even a glance. To say the least, we left. Tonight I decided to give it another shot. The overpriced food was ok, at best. I found plastic pieces in my rolls... When I mentioned it, nicely, the waitress acknowledged it was disgusting and flicked it off her finger.  Our waitress obviously has never served before. She put priority on taking pictures with her friends over her job. We didn't get a single refill, worse, not even asked for one the hour and a half we were here. I waited for 30 minutes to close out the bill. I literally walked the tab to her register. She blushed and said, \"oh, ha, I forgot.\" Save your money and your time, go to Tomo."}
{"text":"\"I thought I'd already written a review for this place.\" If I had a maki for every time I said that, I'd really be rolling.  \"Mr. Sushi\" formerly, and I'm talking at least ten years ago, but this name \"Akaihana\" was attached as well if I remember correctly. They have dropped the former, but the quality has thankfully stayed the same.   Four stars for sure, but I surrender the fifth for an exceptional treat on this past Christmas Eve. Running late to a late supper in Paradise Valley, we wanted to sneak in a bite and seeing as this place closes at 2pm; I called en route at about 1:45 and placed and order, but I requested that, instead of \"to go,\" that it merely be ready for our arrival (probably right around 2pm.) They obliged.   We walked in, were seated promptly and much to the other diner's surprise....several rolls, bowls of miso soup and a seaweed salad were promptly brought to our table. It couldn't have been timed more perfectly. It couldn't have tasted more delicious.   I've found a wonderful trio of rolls is: the Las Vegas, (note: the cilantro/jalapeno aioli that comes with this roll also compliments a filet mignon rather nicely, as I found out on a more recent to-go order!), Spicy Scallop roll and the Alexa Go Go roll.  Top it off with miso soup and a seaweed salad and it's a nice taste selection for two. Add \"Forrest Gump\" for your shrimp fix and \"Marc Roll\"gives your tastebuds a River Eel dance.  Notes:  - They close between lunch and dinner.  - They have A LOT of rolls - see menus, the walls for papers with handwritten descriptions as well as the special boards, outside usually as well as the chalkboard behind the sushi chefs - The strip mall here is totally deserted! Don't let that dissuade you. You can access via Black Canyon Hwy (which is frontage road I-17) or from Northern or 24th Avenue) - It's not a fancy interior but it has character - Service can be slow but always friendly"}
{"text":"Will not be coming back. The edamame was overlooked, the salad was blah, my hand rolls were bland. The miso soup was the only thing that was ok"}
{"text":"A little hidden gem.  Great selection to choose from.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This sushi is absolutely delicious. I had the D-Back and highly recommend it with the spicy tuna rolls.   The happy hour menu is amazing and can not be beat. When you get a sushi craving for lunch I wouldn't go anywhere else!  I ate too much sushi (if there is such a thing) and didn't feel like a fat slob afterwards. The service was prompt and professional.   I will be returning as frequently as possible and recommend it to anyone looking for their next sushi stop."}
{"text":"THEY USE THE CHEAPEST INGREDIENTS!!!!  A salad comprised of mainly iceberg lettuce.  Worse salad in the valley."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place! They have so much to choose from its hard to decide on just a few items. My boyfriend and I have been there twice so far. On our first visit we happen to get there during happy hour. Needless to say it was BUSY! I know a lot of people hate to go to restaurants when they are packed but not this girl! To me, it says a lot about the food! We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and started salavating as we picked out a few rolls. We decided on the Manhattan Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Soft Shrimp Hand Roll and one other that escapes me at the moment! Ha! Anyways, the Manhattan Roll was on point!!! Oh so good! The Soft Shell Crab Roll was amazing! Not fishy at all! I think my other half could have eaten a ton of those. The Las Vegas Roll was definitely different than you'd get at most sushi places. It had some sort of green sauce rather than the typical eel sauce. Because I am so use to the average Las Vegas roll, I was a bit taken back at first, but after each bite, I rather enjoyed it! Man I wish I could remember the other roll we had because it too was fantastic!  The second visit was not during happy hour. It was by far, not as busy. We sat at the bar as we usually do and was greated by Sean. This guy should be in comedy! He kept us entertained with his humor which was refreshing since most sushi chefs are so dang serious! On this day we ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Rose Royce Roll. I'm not even go into reviewing the Shrimp Tempura Roll. Don't get me wrong, it was delish! But I have to tell you about the Rose Royce Roll....can you say spicy? No.....spicy does no justice to this roll. Hot? Hmmm....no. Let's see...how about a nice subtle heat that turns into a punch in the throat like sneak attack from highly trained Ninjas! Yep that'll do! This roll was so delicious! Packed with fresh cut habenero, If you are a novice to hot food, you will never get through this roll! This thing had us both sweatin' to the oldies! But we loved it! Sean was gracious enough to let us try some jelly fish. The marinate was very tasty but the texture was like eating soft plastic. Very cartilage-y lol! The service was great! Never had to ask for drink refills since they were on top of that. We will definitely be back here. So far this is our \"sushi place of choice\"."}
{"text":"Mr. Sushi has excellent sushi! I have had sushi all the way from virginia to arizona and this place is definitley in my top 4. I love to go there and I am there at least twice a week. The rolls are delicious, fresh and different. The godzilla roll, omg i wish i had one right now. The staff is friendly and service is quick. It is tucked in a little shopping center so it's kind of hard of find, like a treasure well worth looking for."}
{"text":"Went and got sushi for lunch and loved it. I sat at the bar and watched the guys make all the sushi. I ended up ordering like 4 rolls, 1 salmon sashimi and a teriyaki chicken and everything was perfect. I loved the food and the atmosphere. Great place."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Japanese joint.  Sushi is always fresh, excellent and reasonably priced.  Tempuras and appetizers are wonderful.  Try the chicken yakitori and the baked scallops.  Service is sometimes spotty.  It's my go to place for a casual night out with sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in central Phoenix. Lunch combos are generous in portion and light on the wallet."}
{"text":"I read continuous reviews on Mr. Sushi and couldn't wait to try it out. When we got there.....the place had a different name, guess it changed management. I wasn't too sure what to expect but I can honestly say I was not impressed. The place was dirty, our table was dirty...and the food was nothing to rave about. Won't visit that place again."}
{"text":"Seriously!?  I, for the life of me, cannot figure out why this place is rated so high.  AND.  Reviews actually say the best around?  Then you don't get out much.  Listen.  It isn't horrible.  But it is certainly the Denny's of sushi joints.  Service was friendly.  Sesame seaweed was a perk because no one seems to serve it anymore.  Veggie tempura was dripping grease.  And.  There are five thousand different sushi rolls that all sound and taste the same!  We had soft shell crab roll, shrimp with eel, and spicy tuna with cilantro.  The cilantro was a GREAT addition, but the tuna was fishy and strangely colored.  Soft shell crab wasn't terrible, shrimp and eel was really fishy.  I do not believe the Rolls were rolled correctly as they just fell apart. I'm sorry, but I was unimpressed, and we won't be returning.  Again, super friendly people, and neighborhood joint atmosphere cannot make up for food, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We have not been here in a few months as the complex has been under construction. But it is by far our favorite place for sushi!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and selection! Fresh fish and delicious food! The jalapeño poppers are fantastic! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"all time fave place for good sushi and other japanese food. personal fave is the baby squid salad and the las vegas roll. i also tried their takoyaki and it is good as well. the staff is always friendly and helpful. i recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place really changed after they remodeled and extended their building. Their sushi is mainly rice now and their sashimi salad is basically just greens with little pieces of fish. I feel really sad writing this because we used to come every week for years and would tell everyone how generous they were with their fresh fish."}
{"text":"I love this place I have come here for a few years now! I love the food and have always received great service! Also, the ambiance is relaxed. Good place for dinner with a very good price."}
{"text":"Shockingly delicious. I got the rainbow roll. Mmm. I was with 2 other people. We cleaned our plates. The prices are affordable. This restaurant isn't the most beautiful place I've ever laid eyes on, its just okay looking inside and out. The food though, is fantastic. The only reason I took a star away is because one of us received our order about 5 minutes after the other two. If it wasn't for that, they would  have had a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The husband loves sushi.  Me, not so much.  Therefore the subject of sushi or Japanese food never came up.  He would pass this little place tucked back into a strip all as he drove to work each day for a couple of years.   Well, today for some reason I had a hankering for either teriyaki chicken or a jakisoba bowl.  The heat had rendered cooking unimaginable so we had to get something to eat.  After checking Yelp and what was nearby I found that there were many more than just fast food bowl chains.  This online menu looked to fit the bill and would give the hubby a sushi fix as well.  The place was easy to find as there are not many other businesses around.  The space is nice and intimate but not too cramped.  There were a lot of people there and the menu was quite extensive.  I had the yakisoba and the hubby had teriyaki chicken and some sushi.  The portions are HUGE and the tea excellent.  I had the mango ice cream for dessert was was absolute bliss."}
{"text":"I love good sushi, and what I got last night was not good sushi.  There are some things that I get, or try to get, every time I go for sushi: tamago (not always available), smoked salmon nigiri, and Philly rolls.  Add edamame for an appetizer and I'm pretty happy.  Eel sauce in a ramekin is always a good thing for dipping.  Last night was a great disappointment.  Let's address the specifics of what I ordered.  First, the salmon nigiri was mis-cut.  It should be cut with the grain/fat strands at a right angle to the length of the fillet, so that you can easily bite through it.  It was not, so each bite required additional work to separate the piece you just bit from the remainder.  The flavor of the salmon was marginal, I don't know if it wasn't smoked just right or what.  I don't think the fish was bad in that it didn't smell, but the flavor just wasn't right.  Philly rolls.  I realize this is 'white man's sushi', but I like it.  I have never been known to leave any sushi standing when I finish my meal, even at a joint in Dallas where I left a scathing review, and yet I left half my Philly rolls un-et.  Numerous problems presented themselves, starting with the rolls were not tight, resulting in them falling apart when picked up.  I'm not sure how to express what was wrong with the cucumber, I think it boils down to it was mushy, not crisp.  Maybe it wasn't cold when cut or they chose the wrong area to cut from?  The flavor was unexceptional, I expect a crisp bite with a punch of the cream cheese, a crisp crunch of the cucumber, and the subtle flavors of the smoked salmon.  This roll had none of that, and thus half of it was left behind.  I will complement them on the tamago, though it was not listed on the menu as such.  This is the first time that I've seen it listed on the menu as 'Sweet Egg', which it is, but if I don't see it under tamago, I assume it isn't there.  But I asked for it, and I got it.  And it was good.  At least this one thing was done well, though it would have held together better if they'd used longer seaweed cuts to wrap the band around it to attach it to the rice puck.  The salmon nigiri, likewise, was not directly on the menu.  I asked for it and got it, but as I said, it was disappointing.  The edamame was decent, but unremarkable.  They didn't strike me as freshly steamed/hot, possibly they'd been sitting waiting for the waitress.  They also offer 'garlic edamame', I'm not sure what the difference is but it might simply be using garlic salt instead of regular, and it really didn't do anything to enhance the flavor.  Speaking of enhancing flavor, the eel sauce was also disappointing.  I'm not sure what it was, but the flavor just did not appeal.  We ordered two other rolls there.  One was a crab roll, not a crab salad roll as my companion has a mayonnaise sensitivity, and it was good.  We both liked it.  Pleasant flavors, quite yummy.  The other roll, whose name I do not recall nor do I want to, had an off-putting aroma and the flavor did nothing to overcome that.  A couple pieces of that were also left behind.  And glancing at Meg's review in the sidebar, I think there might also be a seasoning problem with the sushi rice.  I'm not entirely certain on that one, but that could explain why many of the flavors were just not quite right.   In the end, a bad evening at a restaurant that will not see us again.  This was also a scouting mission for places to frequent in the future since our favorite sushi place closed down, but this is not a place to which I will be returning.  It is possible that they had their 'B Team' working last night, but my companion and I agreed that one star is all they deserved and we won't be back.   One final comment.  I notice that their ratings have been steadily trending down over the last couple of months.  It seems to me that something has happened here and I hope their decline is temporary for their sake."}
{"text":"Experience is great ... the food is delicious!! Make sure you order saki bomber together if not they over charge for the beer .. cheaper to get it together"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the area! So many rolls to choose from that are well made and large enough to share. They play lively music in there! You can sit at the sushi bar, and soon they will have patio seating. I recommend their cucumber salad and the Blue fire roll. The deserts there are yummy like mochi!! Prices are average, they do have a sushi happy hour. Open for lunch but closed for a couple of hours before opening for dinner so check the times."}
{"text":"Having family dinner here on a Sunday evening and is pretty busy.  Ordered the Salmon combo #C which comes with miso soup, salad, tempura, rice and California Roll.   The Salmon is on the small size but pretty tasty. The Miso Soup is pretty good with a generous amount of salad. The tempura is crisp yet not dry.  Have had the Udon and Ramen Soup before and they are both served in good size bowls.  Service is always fast and reliable. If you can understand their broken English.   Don't generally come here to eat because of the distance but they do a great job with food and service."}
