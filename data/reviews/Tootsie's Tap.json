{"text":"We stopped in for a drink and decided to have the nightly special. The special was the Tootsie's Bird special. This consisted of smoked turkey breast, smoked chicken drummies and smoked chicken leg and thigh. All served on Texas toast with side of smoked baked beans with chunks of bacon. DELICIOUS!!! everything was great and you cant beat the price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! You never know what clever specials might be on the menu. Anything smoked here is always good. Staff is so welcoming."}
{"text":"Of the 3 bars in Dane, this is the one you will want to go to.

The sole bartender was friendly and greeted all of the non-townies with hmm service, even teaching us to play the daily shake.

There's a pool table, dart board, a handful of slot machines, and even a Touch Tunes jukebox.

I got the first round of drinks and the total came to $13 for 4 drinks. That's insanely cheap.

Their beer selection was quite impressive for this small town bar; offerings included Surly Furious, Founders All Day IPA, and Central Waters porter. They even carried White Claw flavors!

Oh and the best thing? They accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Read the Yelp reviews and decided to check it out. Small bar with a great selection of bad beers.....Blatz,Hamms, Old Milwaukee  as well as local beer. Having a hard time imagining the food people are talking about coming from the kitchen but I'm sure it's true.

Check it out.  Good experience."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner on a Monday night. Owner and other patrons were very friendly and welcoming. We both had the daily specials. High quality meat from the Lodi Meat Market! Great experience, we will certainly be back....."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical from the outside. Once. inside it was actiually very clean but small. I had a burger. Was best burger I've had in a long time. $5 !! Seriously great burger. I live 15 miles away but will be back!"}
{"text":"I ventured out to Dane to visit Tootsie's a few weeks ago, and it was well worth the trip. When I told my friends where I was going for dinner, I was met with furrowed brows of confusion.  \"Dane? Like the Great Dane?\"  Admittedly, I was not familiar with the city or its citizens either, but I had heard great things about this little bar called Tootsie's and their inventive, and at times risky cuisine.  I found out quickly that  this little hometown gem was worth the back-country trek. 

 From the outside, this place looks like your standard dive bar, and honestly, it's appearance on the inside does too.  There are several tables set up for dining and a singular pool table lurking in the corner.  All of these things are fairly standard,  but what makes Tootsie's special is the proprietor, employees, and patrons.  We were there on a weekday night and the place was just banging.  Each person sitting at the bar was friendly and inviting.  Drinks were flowing and the party was on.  The owner was walking around and talking to everyone and the bartender and chef were equally amiable.  

What was even more impressive was the food.  Tootsie's surprisingly houses a full kitchen in the back of the bar, making it possible to provide high end daily specials to patrons. The night we were there the special was  roasted quail and smoked pork belly.  We had the choice of picking either of the options or a combination of both. My dining partner and I opted for one of each.  Usually I'm very critical of the way restaurants cook each of these proteins.  Pork belly is one of those foods, along with duck breast, that is ruined for me without proper rendering.  At Tootsie's it was cooked perfectly, and was served in a large meaty portion. Yum.  The quail was cooked to perfection, boasting moist morsels of meat.  

Wait....hold on...I forgot one major thing: the ranch.  

Some people (my husband included) look down on me for my love of ranch dressing, but I stand proud with my obsession.  I will eat anything dipped in this herbed mayonnaise sauce.  The chef at Tootsie's brought me out TWO different kinds of ranch to use on my salad and side dishes, and I was in heaven.  For me, the ranch alone is worth the trip. 

Overall, go to Tootsie's with your expectations in check.  This small bar will most likely win you over the same way it wooed me.  It was a fun trip out to the country for this city girl, and I plan on making it many many more times."}
{"text":"Perfect bar food, Strong drinks, friendly bartender. This is a quintessential dive bar atmosphere with a simple menu. Try the fries with bacon and cheese.  Really simple nice place to stop if you are coming through Dane."}
{"text":"Yup - Check this joint out. If Yelp asks if it's \"divey\" - it is. But it's worth the detour or excursion to the Town of Dane. So if you're on the way back from Devil's Lake or Circus World or Wollersheim Winery, just go. 

It's a one room classic Wisconsin Tavern. It's clearly a locals joint. Don't be intimidated by the row of Harley's parked in front of the door. Everyone in the place was nice, down right friendly.... and I'm guessing there is a regular flow of recreational bikers coming and going. The bartender knew just about everyone there except for us. But we'll be back. 

The fresh burgers and bacon comes from the Lodi, one town over, and you can tell it's fresh and local. Prices are extremely reasonable. Of course there's a full bar with about five beers on tap and an ample supply of bottled beers including local favorites. But it's the burgers I'll be back for. 

So take the field trip and check out Tootsies. Seek out the out of the way local joints during your summer travels."}
