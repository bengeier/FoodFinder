{"text":"I visited this location more than once .I am really excited that we in Downtown core got more options when buying a quick meal.
My coworker is joining me now as well because of the halal meat choices offered there.
I tried all three options, like wrap, bowl and plate, but my favorite is fattoush salad with either chicken shawarma or kafta.

It's nice to see shawarma being cooked in front of you,  assures you that you're getting freshly cooked meat and not to early pre cooked stuff or leftovers..

It looks like guys working there are really rushing and  moving  the long line during lunch rush hour.

Btw their garlic sauce is really garlic..lol Just a warning in case you're attending a meeting after your meal."}
{"text":"Had beef shawarma.
Rice: Good. Large portion ensures you're full. 
Salad: Good. Fresh and crisp.
Beef: Good. It's beef alright."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed with this location. I found my shawarma too be way too salty to really enjoy the wrap or really taste much flavor. 

Was really expecting more from Paramount. I'd be open to giving them another try at a different non-food court location, but would probably give this location a pass in the future."}
{"text":"For what you pay for the amount of food is not worth it. And you're limited to one sauce between garlic and tahini and hot sauce. What place only offers one sauce and charges for the other kinds ..."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick delicious middle eastern/ Lebanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I was a little leery approaching this food-court place, but I adored it. The food was fresh, tasty and prepared with a level of care you don't expect in food courts.

I also loved that I was able to choose precisely what I wanted. I never want the huge pile of white rice you often get in middle eastern plates, and white-bread pita. Starch for lunch, no thanks. Here, everything is an option, so you get what you want. I got exceptionally good chicken on salad, (Really fine texture and flavour!) with vegetables of my choice and hummous, tasty tahini sauce.

PLUS, they gave me a cup of water free without flinching. That is my pet peeve with food courts when management has them say: \"We don't have glasses\" forcing staff to peddle from the rip-off garbage-making bottled tap water industry.  Not here. \"Of course, no problem, let me get you water\"


This is how I try to eat. Protein & veg. I love that this place gives me that choice, and with TASTY food. Grateful to the owner, good luck with your business!"}
