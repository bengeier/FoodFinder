{"text":"Stopped in to check it out a few weeks back...great bartender and good company.  Good place to hang out and hear some music.  Loved the fries!"}
{"text":"I would have only given this bar one star if it was not for the incredibly attentive bartenders. They were quick with my drinks all night long. Now let's discuss why I am giving this bar the low rating. I have been to many concerts in my time. I have never, ever heard of a bar owner skipping out and not paying the band that gave their all to entertain. Let alone a national act like tonight. I went to the bar to celebrate a friends birthday and it just so happened that the band Kill Devil Hill was playing there this night. This band was formed by Rex Brown of Pantera/Down and Vinny Appice of Black Sabbath/Dio/Heaven & Hell. Now I was completely unfamiliar with KDH until tonight really but they put on a hell of a show for the venue. After doing a meet & greet to sign autographs and meet the fans it came out the owner was drunk and left with all the bars money so the band couldn't get paid. That is unheard of right? There are contracts on big bands coming into town. Needless to say the bar got pretty hectic as the band and their fans demanded the band get paid. This is just another example of bad business people trying to be their own boss. If he isn't going to pay the people that bring money into his place how is he going to treat you as a nobody patron? If you are in a band and think of playing here I would ask for my money up front!"}
{"text":"this bar isn't very busy as I think the location has a reputation of not staying long.  the bar needs more publicity and exposure to the locals.  they need to stay open more then 4 days a week as I have seen other bars in the area succeed more and do very well.  I also was told I can dj at the bar but I have to bring people in before I can.  this bar I love I just feel I am being used to promote their bar.  my favorite person that work at the bar is Mike as he gives me a chance at being the dj.  I also love the cooks at the bar and they make my food very good."}
{"text":"place is never open.  they leave the kitchen doors wide open so the mosquitoes that mentor on the lake is famous for can get in and into your food.  you cant walk in the place with out walking thru a wall of smoke employees smoking in the kitchen.  dont go to this place its disgusting"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, this sounds like a shady spot you could go fight or buy drugs. Nice!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Crappy, repetitive gangsta rap played the whole time. We wanted to leave but our wings weren't done; after waiting forty minutes the manager informed us we couldn't take them to go. Apparently this dump goes under every three months or so; hopefully it stays true to form."}
{"text":"I'd rather get drunk in a trash can than spend two minutes in this dump. Nothing but problems too. The cops are always getting called there for one thing or another. With the handful of other bars within walking distance of this place, I don't know how they get any business at all."}
{"text":"They dont pay their bands and the Charge not just the customers but the bands for water. Crap management, dirty bar."}
{"text":"Pay the bands you owe money to. You want entertainment then pay for it, not a hard concept. I hate trash venues that stiff people. The bands bring people in so you can sell your watered down crap drinks. Without them you wouldn't be in business. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Agree with most of the reviews, would have been one star if not for the decent band (which is why we went) or the nice bartenders. Heard a rumor from someone in the know that they refill the premium bottles of booze with well and was warned to just stick with bottled beer. I did see some wings come out that looked decent and smelled good. And if I were underage and lived in MOL I would probably hang out here and shoot pool. But overall impression was dirty, dark,  sketchy, and overpriced for a dive. And I love dives."}
