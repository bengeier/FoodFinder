{"text":"This place is ok. With the had some fish items.  But ten again... I don't think they're known for their \"freshness\".  Most of the food just sits there for a while. It does taste pretty good tho."}
{"text":"The very best service this time due to Rachel who provided superior customer service and attention like I have never seen before from Panda Express.  She made the experience at Panda excellent"}
{"text":"I agree with the precious review; many of the dishes were not not available when I came in. I was told that I would have to wait 5 minutes for most of the dishes to come out, so I did. 10 minutes later, I was still waiting. Eventually someone noticed I was still waiting, apologized and offered me a free drink. I ended up getting the orange chicken, walnut shrimp and mandarin beef (crispy beef). The food was not that bad, typical Chinese takeout, but a little healthier. I think that the fried rice was brown rice. Note that the walnut shrimp is considered a premium item and has an additional charge.   While I don't have complaints about the servers, the manager of the place did act very professionally. With an open kitchen, customers can watch their food being cooked and any interactions in the kitchen. That day, the manager reprimanded one of the cooks; not only did this slow down the food being prepared, but it was unprofessional. As I watched, I felt very bad for the guy; he was only one of two cooks, and from the time that I got there, he was cooking fast and hard. I think that Panda Express needs to hire more cooks to have food ready to go, as they are a fast food/ take out restaurant, and consider better training for their managers."}
{"text":"I live close & visit this establishment frequently . Tonight it was about 8 pm, they start shutting down even though they don't close until 9 or 10pm. I dare you charge my children and I for ratchet food that's been there for hours lifeless! That mgr, wish I got her name, snapping back. You are so unprofessional & rude! You don't stiff customers because your lazy ass don't want to make fresh food! Disgusting! I won't be back & km going to tell everyone I know to avoid that trap you call a restaurant !"}
{"text":"So a good friend and myself decided to eat out today while on break from class. I remember her telling me once that she had never eaten at a Panda before so I recommended we eat at the one near campus. She agreed. I had anticipated that there would be 1 or 2 people in front of us ordering their food.  Was I right?  No  This restaurant was dead. Absolutely dead, no one except those working there was there. I gave it a 4 because of that. Overall, as always I love the food. But being today was a religious holiday I couldn't eat certain foods. that was the only down side but nothing that would bring me down or stop me from eating panda."}
{"text":"BLAHHHHH....looked way better then it tasted.... under cooked noodles, over cooked meats.....no thanks...wont b coming back...."}
{"text":"Typical Panda Express as far as the consistency of the food, but they can be VERY skimpy on the portions.....watch them closely!!  First time I went there, I got probably 4 pieces of Bejing beef and 5 pieces of Orange chicken.....by the time I drove the 3 miles home and saw that, I was not going to return and complain, so I went online and filled out the survey to get a free entree next time.  On my next visit, with the coupon in hand, they tried to skimp on the portions again......I told them that if they did not put more in the container, I was going to walk out and never return to this location again. They looked at me angrily, but put more in the container.  I told them they will NEVER get away with skimping on my portions again... Only to be told \" thank you, come again\""}
{"text":"I live across the street and don't have a car so don't have many choices in where to eat out if and when we do. I will choose anything over Panda again! The last two times my husband went there for me when I was having a craving the food had been sitting for a while cause it was cold and mushy... Not to mention I got food poisoning just 2 weeks ago from there!!!! GO ANY PLACE ELSE!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst service.. Just went in to get some take out.. The cashier young uninterested asian female, was not listening to what we were ordering, she seemed annoyed because we wanted potstickers not ragoon! Never again!"}
{"text":"The drive thru model is not working. Both the drive thru and inside line take forever. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get food at Panda Express ( all the food is already made...hello). Please figure this out."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Panda Express and I usually stick to my normal dishes such as the black pepper chicken and the kung pao chicken but this time I tried the new short ribs and I must say I was impressed. Way to go Panda!!!!"}
{"text":"I love their food, but don't go during peak time.  You will be in line for a long time."}
{"text":"This establishment has poor service and bad attitudes, food was not ready. This place is just horrible. There was teenagers running around all over the place and the employees just ignore you. I had saved a table for my family to sit at. One of the employees took two chairs. I told they that I was saving those chairs for my family, the employee said that they needed it to close the bathrooms and still they took the chairs. I had to move to a different table at that point.   When I finally got my food, which was the same as every other panda, moderate tasting. At the end of my dinner, we started to hand out the cookies and they ended up not giving us the proper number of cookies. Then, one of the cookies didn't even have a fortune in it. So we were technically screwed out of two cookies! Just the topping of a horrible time!"}
{"text":"We had to wait for food for a few minutes, but nothing out of the ordinary for Panda Chain restaurants. They ran out of Dr. Pepper, but they gave me free entree coupons to use at a later date to make up for it. The food was good, building was clean, portions were great, and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Came right at the dinner rush, they were quick to get me through the line and order was accurate. Offered items that weren't on the menu board. Lupita is the person who helped me from start to finish and was friendly and professional, good service, good food you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I could not believe how bad the fried rice was it was not even edible it was all burnt and hard, the orange chicken was horrible it tasted rubbery. I just couldn't even eat the food and I ordered it from postmates while I was at work so it I couldn't even go back and get my money back for the horrible food was. It all tasted old and just so bad!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE PLACE AVOID IT LIKE A DISEASE. Employees are talking and hanging out and don't mind the fact they have to work. Food is reheated and dry and the lady short and a little heavy is the rudest person to ever serve on the face of this earth. Dirt and terrible service."}
{"text":"Disappointed  the owner of this Panda as well as one on 75th ave and Cactus must have a policy of not making food till someone walks in, and its always the same saying bye all employees 2 minutes lol !!! Really !!! I've actually timed them and best case is 15 minutes , everytime I go they have empty bowls and never more than 3-4 people working even on a busy Friday night dinner rush. And to make it worse they prepare your plate and let it sit there to get cold while your waiting (2 minute) still funny... For your main items. Now I understand things happen, but this is literally every time I go and that's about 3-4 times a month. Get it together Owner. I love Panda but the way these stores are run is horrible !!"}
{"text":"Staff was really nice and friendly. Noodles and orange chicken were really good. Honey sesame chicken was ok at most. Went around 5 pm on a Friday and they food was being replaced fairly quickly, there was no old food just setting around."}
{"text":"This location is by far the most consistent in having noodles out way to long. Same goes for fried rice. Not good at all. Should have fresher food out. Have tried too many times, various times of the day and been let down. Time for a new location."}
{"text":"I usually love Panda Express but I won't be coming back to this one! The two ladies working were really rude to both me and my husband and were slamming our food and drinks down on the counter. One lady barely  put any chicken on my plate. I asked if she could put a little more. She said \"I can for $1.50!\". To top it off they barely spoke English. Ive never had an experience like this at a panda express. I won't be back here that's for sure!"}
{"text":"It's a Chinese place run by Mexicans. They know nothing about how real chinese food should taste. Not freshly cooked. No coke or Pepsi."}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive service. Issue with order was fixed and I was given a free bonus. Great people! Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"My favorite and only Panda Express spot I would ever go ! Tina is AMAZING !!! She gives great customer service and everytime I come in she greets me so well and it's always a Laugh with her  5 Stars for Tina and her GREAT Customer service"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Panda Express so for that alone they always get three stars, this location gains a star for the hot fresh food, clean restrooms and clean table and chairs that I sat on.  They lose that last star for my experience here with the amount of food they gave me.    I was finished shopping at the outlet mall and got a notification that my plane was an hour delayed, I needed to pass more time and I was so over gambling. I was hungry and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on airport food. I saw the Panda Express sign and thought that it would be a perfect place to repack my bags and spend my new found hour before I needed to drop off my rental car.  I'm sure I'm not the only person who ever bought so much stuff that they had to buy a cheap duffel bag right?    Anyways, I get there and park, change my top, repack my (now plural) bags and go inside.  I normally order a two entree plate and save some of it for the next day, since I didn't have that option I opted to get a rice bowl.  The menu states it is one serving of an entree and your choice of chow mien/fried or steamed rice.  I order the sweet fire chicken, steamed rice and a drink, it comes to almost seven dollars but whatever, I was looking really forward to my food.  Then I look down at the food, yes it is hot and fresh but I have about five pieces of chicken, huge clumps of onions, one chunk of pineapple and a ton of steamed rice.  Disappointment!  I'm not even sure if I got a half scoop of the chicken dish.  Since I was eating there I guess I could have complained but honestly I was tired, hungry and knew my day was only half over.  The food was really good but I wish there had been more of it and less of the empty carbs."}
{"text":"Used the web site to order to go.... was quick and food was ready and great. The missing fifth star is from not checking to see if the person picking up the food is the person who called up....."}
{"text":"'Express' is a joke! Drive-thru line took 25 minutes. Ordered honey walnut shrimp, paid an extra $2 just to go home and see they filled up most of the space with orange chicken and hardly any shrimp. This is the WORST location I have ever been to. Maybe need to take a look at management and make some changes. Not a happy customer."}
{"text":"Their customer service sucks there. Every time we decide to go their I hope different people are working there.  Today the orange chicken was bla. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Today I went to this restaurant and I had such horrible experience. The server was so rude to me as I ordered my food he kind of questioned me if I had enogh money to pay for the meals I was ordering. He made me feel so uncomfortable. Also the cashier named Ethel C. Was also with an attitude. She did not give forks for my meals or napkins for my meals. The food is good, but the customer service is horrible. Management should do something about it. I will never buy food at this place."}
{"text":"Buyer Beware - Extremely underwhelming and bland . . . I ordered their signature orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp with a side of steamed rice. All three items were super dry and flavourless . . . Portions were minimal and I can tell the server was counting the pieces of chicken and shrimp spooned into my take-out box. Overall the service, flavour, food quality and dollar value per portion are way below average . . . I would advise against dining here. However, if the craving persists then head to Schezwan Express, which in my opinion is a much superior alternative than this dismal establishment."}
{"text":"The drive through line was all the way out and threw the parking lot about 20 cars long so I parked I went inside they had one person serving who was serving a family of four one Plate at a time instead of all the plates at the same time. The cashier was charging people for empty plates and there was a line of about 15 plates on the counter of people waiting for their food if your server is slow she probably should not be working on a Friday night!   Not to mention the cooks were constantly grabbing food to cook with their bare hands! And I even saw one cook using the spatula to cut open bags of chow main over the wok, I don't like chunks of plastic with my food thank you!!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to this location and now I know why.  The food is crap!  The service is ok.  They don't clean out of the trash bins.    This time it wasn't crowded or at least have some people in the restaurant when I first got there.  It was 1:00 p.m. and I was the only one in the restaurant.  They didn't have any trays to carry your food.  I had to ask, which is odd to me.  When I got to where the plastic ware was, there were plenty of forks but no knives!  How could I cut up my Teriyaki chicken without a knife!    This totally sucked!  Everyone that came in...carried out food.  I hope someone from the Panda Express franchise sees this and changes this location!  I'm sure this is not what they want from their store!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not great,but cant say it was bad...if you want some fast Chinese it works."}
{"text":"This Panda Express replaced the beloved-but-ultimately-rendered-redundant-by-Amazon Follett's bookstore. Because it's centrally located on a college campus, the food is usually fresh but if you come an hour or so before closing time, the staff can be loath to prepare an entree if they are out of it. That said it's still quite an improvement from the atrocious quick service Chinese restaurant that used to be located nearby at the Illini Union food court.    The 'classic' Panda Express entrees, Orange Chicken and Beijing Beef, taste alright individually but collectively both score high on the saccharine sweet index. To tone down some of that excessive sweetness, pair one of the two with something less sugary like black pepper chicken and you're good to go. I find the chicken egg roll to be on point though. It's hot and crispy so no quibbles there."}
{"text":"It is the worst location! I got the runs! I would never eat here again. They are trained to not waste food these Chinese people, that they will serve every morsel even if it's gone bad."}
{"text":"Actually real Chinese food is far more delicious than those in Panda Express, those food in Panda is extremely oily. It tastes okay but remember its not real Chinese food."}
{"text":"I just experienced the worst service from Panda Express at 24th street and Baseline.  There are 2 girls taking the orders, one black and another of Asian decent. I asked if they can make more pacific shrimp and the black girl said yes in 5-6 mins. So I told her I can wait.  After 15 mins I asked if it is ready and she said.  They are making other things first.  So of c ourselves I reminded her that she said 5-6 mins.  After another 15 mins she asked if she can take my order.  I said sure.  I want the family feas, rice only in one box and rice and chow me in combined in the other box.  Why did she immediately got upset and sad they don't serve combinations and I need to just pick one.  I told her I buy the same thing every week and I wanted to know if it was just her location.  She whispered to the other girl and then she put the combination in, put only half box.  I had to ask her if she could put more and she was not happy.  So now that the shrimp is ready they need to make more chicken and green beans and she didn't want to tell the guys cooking.  I had to ask her multiple times.  Then I realize that I was standing in Panda for more than one hour with no food and had to go pack to work.  So all I got from them was bad service.  DON'T GO THERE FOLKS.  FIND ANOTHER LOCATION."}
{"text":"I would give them no stars if possible I would recommend everyone stay away from this Panda Express for many reason first reason is horrible service I ask when is there fresh batch of chow mien she said few minutes so I waited when fresh batch came out the lady pour the old chow mien on top and gave me old chow mien when I specifically waited for new one to come out I was super pissed noodles tastes like sh#% I was super pissed not to mention old orange chicken and broccoli beef it all look like it had been sitting there for 2 hours it look so gross. And trust me it all tasted awfull"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick and easy dinner for a late night. We've always had good luck with Panda. To start of this bad experience, Claudia had the worst attitude and very poor customer service skills; from the eye rolls and the tone of her voice she should not be allowed to interact with customers. The cashier was friendly. The food was ok. Some of the chicken was really dry and some of it was really saucy so it was very inconsistent."}
{"text":"Very poor service. They weren't very busy but we were ignored while the girl talked to an off the clock worker hanging out near the cash registers. When she finally started to serve us she continued to talk and we saw spit fly out of her mouth and onto our plate of food. We immediately said we've changed our minds and left. This is disgusting and certainly a health code issue. We will not ever be eating at this location again."}
{"text":"Absolutely great customer service from Sheetal! She was very patient with us, let us taste multiple foods to decide what we wanted, made us fresh food after 8pm instead of saying they were out of it for the day, put all the soy sauce and sweet n sour sauce in our bag without us even asking, was very sweet and friendly and smiling. I wish more businesses had workers and customer service like her. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Best service ever. Food was great, kitchen/lobby/bathroom very CLEAN, and true customer service in every possible aspect!  Thank you  I will be recommending this location and looking into catering needs for my company."}
{"text":"The whole crew was miserable. They would not look at you in the eye. They did not ask if I needed anything else, they just wanted me gone. That is the feeling I got."}
{"text":"Service seems to get worse every time we go. I believe it is a training store and it shows. We shall find another location."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this Panda express, it was like every other Panda express I've visited. What makes this one particularly special is that Manny and Erika work there. Manny is really helpful, quick with the order, and memorizes who you are giving it that personal touch. Erika is not only beautiful, she gives everyone a five star experience. Manny and Erika is the reason I continue to go to this location and will continue to go as long as they are there."}
{"text":"When it first open the wait was too long but simmered down. The food taste good but the portions are a little small  . The price is right though!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the person that served us the food was horrible.. Manuela.. I don't know why she gave us this kind of rude service..  It was a good location, price was pretty steep but the food is good.. But the service was bad.. We felt rushed out of there as well and it wasn't busy at all.."}
{"text":"Meh. I stood in line, (by myself), while the employees stood around talking for a good 5 minutes. I guess it gave me time to check in on Yelp, so whatever. Other than that, it was standard Panda fare."}
{"text":"Whitest Chinese food you'll ever eat! Still pretty good though."}
{"text":"It's Panda. Obviously, there's better Chinese food out there. But for quick, Americanized Chinese fast food, Panda is pretty much king."}
{"text":"Health Warning.  Was in drive thru when Renzo dropped a to go container. He then picked up container from the floor and placed on food prep area partially in fried rice serving tray. I said something to Renzo who reluctantly threw away container and removed tray of fried rice. After receiving my food they added more food to already contaminated tray of fried rice. Disgusting. Health Warning"}
{"text":"Yep the narcissistic jerks who run this place are still there. Nothing but complaints. The only reason people still use this place is they have a drive thru. When you have an issue with their nasty food they toss you out. Because how DARE you complain. And the shit heads at their corporate office are worse. Frankly I'm checking to see if they are publicly owned. I used to work for a major brokerage house and guess who I'm calling tomorrow? Lots and lots of brokers!!!"}
{"text":"I love panda express, but I just watched a lady change her mind after her order was ready to be paid for. She didnt realize that there was an upcharge for her shrimp entre. The lady behind the counter PUT IT BACK WITH THE FRESH FOOD. That is disgusting. Then she decided instead of beef Broccoli, she wanted orange chicken. The lady put both entres back with the fresh. Yuck! I ordered anyways because I was starving and chise a different entre that she had, I chose mushroom chicken. Even though the restaurant wasnt that busy all of the tables were dirty. To top it all off both my fried rice and mushroom chicken were stine cold. I will never be back to this lication despite its convenient proximity to my house."}
{"text":"They offer online ordering, which is a breeze to use. You might want to check your order before you leave though. One of my kids meals was supposed to have white rice, but had fried rice instead.   The food is pretty standard for Chinese food. I got the 2 entrée plate with Orange Chicken and teriyaki chicken and fried rice.   A chocolate chip cookie comes with the kids meal, and it's yummy!"}
{"text":"Sad. This chain used to be god for quick decent food. Now the last three tries they were horrible. That orange chicken used to be great but now it's all breading. Other dishes just lacking in quality and I felt ill after eating there. I think they just went cheap in ingredients.  They need to re tool and fast."}
{"text":"Panda Express food is reliable and standardized, and we enjoy it. But this location is in serious need of organization. There was almost no line when I arrived around 4:30pm on a weeknight, but they did not seem to plan ahead to replace items that were sold out. There were no mixed vegetables, so they asked someone to make some (they did not, not at first). Then while I was waiting for the veg, the chow mein sold out and they had to make more. Then while I was waiting for those, the broccoli beef sold out and they called out for more. After those were ready, THEN they started on the veg. They had 3 guys cooking in the back, but they need a plan to continuously replace the items that are popular and almost gone. I waited 20 minutes for my take-out while others just went around me, then when they finally had my items ready I had to remind them what I ordered, as they were about to put in the wrong thing (maybe the server was new and still learning the codes). This is the closest Panda Express to my home, but I'll be going to a different location in the future."}
{"text":"Food is good, but two days in a row I've came in at lunch time and had to wait for mixed vegetables to be made.  I asked two employees why they don't have vegetables ready.  One said they don't make them unless someone orders them, the other one said they go bad fast.   I would think at lunch time they would have vegetables ready."}
{"text":"Of all of the Panda Express chains I have ever tried (from Kihei, Maui, to Las Vegas, NV and now here in the Phoenix area), this one tops them all.  Staff is always nice (which is an added bonus when you get that in any of these types of non tipping establishments) and the food is always good.  They seemed to have beefed up their beef in the their beef and broccoli (but that could just be a coincidence/luck of the draw, whatever...you know what i mean).  Did you ever notice it isn't actually called beef and broccoli, but rather broccoli beef?  haha.  Anyway, if you like Panda's, and you live in the Glendale/Peoria area, it is worth it to go to this one rather than one that may be closer to you."}
{"text":"This is about Lalo. Went about a month ago. Really busy. Lalo was clearly new. But was working hard, and getting stuff done. But the person in line in front of me was basically trying to get him in trouble. She waited until she was in front of the manager before she started to complain(Long line). Instead of telling lalo what's wrong right away.(entrees too close to each other ) Lalo handled her rudeness very well and so did the manager. My favorite location. Always willing to fix their problems"}
{"text":"I'd give this plane NO STARS if could. There was no iced tea available, no steamed veggies ready, & to make it worse was given the WRONG order. Once I got home & opened the boxes is when I realized, & had to drive all the way back to have it corrected. How hard is it to give me two boxes of chow mein? Simple order! Customer service was not even there. Does this issue fall back on management? I mean, come on! Get it together."}
{"text":"Was pleased with service and food until a couple or few months ago.  There has been a noticeable change.  I have noticed that Hispanics served ahead of me are very, very well compensated. When I order the same plate and same entree items, my container is decidedly, noticeably less full.  The first time, it was odd.  The second time, it was bothersome.  Friday, the third time, I was mad.  So, I would recommend this location as clean with food that is usually fresh.  For equality of service and equity, though, I recommend only for Hispanics!"}
{"text":"Pretty much copy paste my other Panda review. It's quick Americanized Chinese fast food. Love it or hate it, it's pretty watered down but still good. I don't understand the bad reviews some of the Pandas in general get. It's fast food Chinese. What are you expecting? :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst panda i have ever been two twice now they have shorted me on the portions and gotten my order incorrect. I am a pretty cool customer and i get the three entrée meal. The portion of one of my entrée choices was so small i doubled up on instead of complaining only to find out that the side box that they filled as my third entree and second portion had 2 pieces of beef in it  and was only a third of the way full. I will not be returning to this particular panda ever again. I spent 10 minutes signing up for yelp just to complain about this; to give you an idea of how infuriated i am. I also always ask for white rice and receive fried rice."}
{"text":"Order my family's meal at 3 PM so it'd be ready at 5 PM the same day. Came it at 5:05 and they didn't have anything ready. The workers weren't rude, but they weren't the nicest either."}
{"text":"Standard Panda Express food. Great new building. The staff is a little rude, probably just need more training in customer service."}
{"text":"I usually like panda but this one is not one that I will go offten. Mika the girl that rang us out wasn't very pleasant and didn't even smile a smile can make a diffrence. .I work in cust.

So to say the least not a pleasant vist"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times with tonight being my last! It has been the 3rd time that we visit this Location and they have been out of Soy Sauce and other ingredients for the Entrees. To top it off the Soda machine was out of order and we were still sold Cups without anyone telling us there was nothing to drink but Tea! Whoever is managing this location needs a couple courses in restaurant management and some of the employees need to upgrade their customer service skills!! If you plan to eat Panda Express Visit the location off the 60 Fwy and Signal Butte. Yes it's always busy but I rather wait an extra 5 minutes in line and have a complete meal..."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Panda. Until now. Tonight it was horrible. Rice: dried out. Orange chicken: just plain cooked wrong, stuck together, yuck.  Mushroom chicken: no mushrooms, no chicken, all zucchini.  I'm really disappointed. Did I mention that I had to wait 10 minutes because there was hardly any food in the serving line and the cook was MIA?"}
{"text":"The food was, but the service was mediocre. There were many other  people there when I went. That staff did not perform well under the pressure. The staff took fartoo long to replace the food"}
{"text":"Horrible service stood for 20 minutes and got no service even when I said excuse me. Two woman one young man stood there and just watched me even when I was trying to speak to them. Asked to speak to manager acted like I was not there. Hopefully I get to speak to district manager about the people they choose to hire at such locations ! Horrible! Spoiled my appetite with such horrible attitude!"}
{"text":"Always fast, friendly, offers samples with a smile, clean and food is awesome"}
{"text":"For a bit more cash you can either go to a good chinese restaurant or a buffet. Absolutely not worth it!!!the food is passable but it all taste exactly the same. I quess the curse of chain restaurants. The fish depending on what day it is apparrently goes up 2 or 3 more dollars with your meal . the lomein has soooo much celery in it that is literally all you can taste. Eeeeh.  Ill just go to the china joes place up the block located next to yama sushi"}
{"text":"Panda Express inside the Planet Hollywood Shop Forum is a great place for some Chinese food. The pricing is very reasonable for a strip location."}
{"text":"Less than stellar experience. We came to the drive thru 40 minutes prior to closing to be told that they only had very limited choices, none of which were what I had intended to get when I arrived there. Word to the wise, don't expect black pepper chicken or beef and broccoli in the hour before closing. Not planning on revisiting this panda location."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for assembly line fast Chinese food.  The food is tasty however the portions are deceiving.  They fill your dish with rice or chow mein and pile on your entree which never has much protein in it.  I love the chicken with string beans and the pepper chicken but you get very little chicken and mostly vegetables.  Prices are too high for the portion size you get.  I do continue to eat here once every few months,"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. Went through the drive through and got all the way home just to not receive teriyaki sauce for the chicken teriyaki. Went back to get the sauce and realized I never got a receipt. Also saw that instead of getting the veggie rolls we ordered we got two orders of wontons. Called to speak to the manager to let them know the experience and about the mistakes and no receipt and Vivians response was what do you want me to do about it? What the!? Apologize, offer a free meal, say you'll make sure it doesn't happen. Anything other than the response you just gave. Will be calling corporate and not going back. It's a shame because it's right around the corner from our house."}
{"text":"The rice and the noodles are always old here never fresh and as for your meat you pick always dried out not worth the time go the the mcdonalds right next to it"}
{"text":"came back to eat at this location. I have to say they have totally turned things around. food, cleanliness and customer service all great. hope it stays this way when corporate people turn it back to a regular crew. good job"}
{"text":"OK, it's Panda Express, same food you get anywhere at Panda. But THIS one will charge you $2.95 for a PAPER CUP of water to go with your meal! They say Panda Express corporate forces them to do this. I can understand charging 25 cents for a cup of water if someone doesn't order food, but charging $2.95 for a paper cup of water for people ordering food... Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"i went there yesterday and they told me 5 minutes until the food i wanted was ready waited 5 minutes the food was not ready in that time.  they took one of the two cooks of the line cooking food to check the front burners left without my order. i went again today because my 9 year old child wanted panda reallly bad ordered a 3 plate combo came home only two items in a three item combo. my 9 year old son was heart broken because he didn't get his being beef that he really wanted.  called the 800 # they started to insert answers that i didn't answer because i wanted them to repeat because i didn't thing any of the prompts actually answered the problem i was calling about. so i hung up and and called back they phone stated i already called and wouldn't take my call this seems very shady more than likely this is my last visit to panda express. my 9 year old is very upset"}
{"text":"The people are always very nice to me. They great me everytime I walk in. They are always smiling and I smile back. I'm a trainer and I noticed those things so keep it up!"}
{"text":"It's would be a lot better if the employee's didn't look like they hated their lives. Terrible service especially from Amanda. Get better staff."}
{"text":"I eat here sometimes for lunch. It's the same as every other Panda I've ate at (and I've ate at a lot all across the US) Food is always hot and fresh, they do a good job of serving customers fast."}
{"text":"I don't frequent panda express at all, and this location did not help alleviate that trend in the slightest. Customer service was very lackluster. Servers appeared lifeless and unamused, and would not pass information to one another. I had to repeat my answer to their asking if I wanted plates 3 times to 3 different people. Not to mention, they failed to inform us of the wait it would take for one of the items and just let us idly sit by.  It doesn't help that the food isn't too exceptional either. This was probably some of the driest fried rice I have ever had the misfortune to experience. Avoid this Panda location... better yet, go find a better Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Maria came by to visit and check in. We had a great lunch and the kung pao chicken has a nice spice!"}
{"text":"Nothing ready had to wait for 4 different things. Employee just standing around doing nothing. I was told the coin dispenser wasn't working and the cashier tried not to give me the 99 cent I was owed. I had to tell him to take it out of the register. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Solid place for lunch. All the familiar panda items are here. And if you stay away from the orange chicken it can actually be pretty healthy. Just make sure to come in around noon or another high volume time or else the items will have been sitting around for a while getting cold/stale."}
{"text":"Im going yesterday for eat a big plate as, and i see the review here before i go so im not  confident, but i think i must to have my own review, and i tell you true this is the best panda express in vegas that i found. Man who work here are nice guys, plate is big and quality is always perfect, you have the speed wifi so its perfect. So try this place for have your own review and dont listen the bad review who are not everytime the good things to judge the place to be."}
{"text":"A great choice if you stay in Planet Hollywood hotel, it was an excellent experience, yummy food, and price accessible to everyone. good quality of food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"We have been to the other Panda Express in Surprise several times, and were happy to see the new location on the West side of town at Prasada.  This location has a drive thru which was very busy.  We went inside, and were pleased to see the restaurant was clean even though they were quite busy.  The line had at least 8 people in front of us, but went very fast!    The staff was very nice, smiling and helpful.  And the food was hot and fresh.  We took food to go, and enjoyed at home.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food here is always amazing. Employees always give me very generous portions as well. Customer service is fine and food is prepared quickly."}
{"text":"I always visit this location being the closest to my house. Restrooms are the cleanest i have seen in fast food. I visited around 7pm yesterday. The dining room needed attention (which is the first time i have seen it in need of). Kym was my server, I was offered multiple samples and felt she really cared about my visit to ensure i come back. Other times have visited i felt rushed (mostly during dinner time, which is understandable) and seems like there is always a new face working, aside from the two girls in the front: Cher and Kym. Over all, i am always satisfied with the food and i will continue to return!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the drive thru service here. Twice they have forgotten my cream cheese rangoons. Twice they have gotten my orders wrong. When I called to complain they took all my info for a replacement/credit on my next order. A month later I return and tell them I should have a credit and they said I should have saved my receipt. Really?? Then why take all my info if your gonna ask for my receipt!! Who saves their food receipts for that long??"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good (as in it's on par with all other panda expresses), but it's just so expensive! A three-entree plate costs $12-13. For Las Vegas, this is pretty cheap, but it just seems ridiculous to pay this much for Panda Express when a three-entree plate at a Panda Express anywhere else would probably be $7-8.   If you can afford to do it, I definitely recommend eating elsewhere, but if you're in Vegas and trying to save money, this isn't a bad option since prices are inflated for most chains in Vegas."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this Panda Express for a few months so I decided to give it a try one night with my buddy. We walked in and were instantly taken back by this rotten smell of something.   The place wreaked and there was a thick steamy texture in the air that made me sick. I do not know why but I ended up ordering food anyways. I ordered some steamed rice, mandarin and orange chicken. I also got some egg rolls to go along with my main course entrees.   We ate outside because the inside stunk. My rice was decent, but the chickens were so salty and undercooked. The egg rolls were good and tasted even better with soy sauce.  The same could not be said for my mandarin chicken or my orange chicken both of those entrees were lost causes"}
{"text":"Just your average Chinese food, I like their main dishes but their rice is always tasteless. Definitely always the last option on my list of places to go. Very quick service though."}
{"text":"The last 3 visits I've been there, there has been rude young employees. Today I went inside to order because the last 2 times was drive through and the employees working the window wanted nothing to do with me. There was nothing but chaos between the employees. No one wants to help each other, they just stumble around each other. All the girls except 1 gave dirty looks and wanted nothing to do with the male employee helping customers. The sauces spilled in my bag and we had to wait 15 minuets for 3 of 5 of my dishes to be made."}
{"text":"Wow,  I am here 30 minutes before close and they are down to just rice and noodles.  Crazy how they are out of every other item and refuse to make more because\"they are closing soon\". I was ready to drop 30 bucks down for me and my family and to top it off another family of 6 walked out because they had no more food.  I get it,  they want no left overs so they can make fresh food in the morning.  Yet,  they are losing money by not taking care of thier late night guests. They need to reevaluate thier closing times or at least get a management team in thier that can better plan thier night time business.  So,  sorry panda, this is the same reason that I have not eaten here in weeks,  I will continue to take my business else where. Guess my business means nothing to you."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. Got there at 730 waited Behind one guy for 20 minutes while they took their sweet time getting one item cooked. There were about 5 people working. Only one girl serving/cashiering (who was SO rude) me and my friend ordered, she had to wait 30 minutes to get her orange chicken. While everyone else was served. When the orange chicken was ready EVERYONE ELSE WAS SERVED THE ORANGE CHICKEN FIRST. While we waited 30 min for it! They forgot about us, THEN there was a SCORPION ON THE FLOOR AND THE CASHIER SAID THATS NORMAL?!?!!! Wow this place needs to be shut down or have corporate fire people and get an exterminator out there! NEVER going back there again. Everyone working was rude and slow and heck."}
{"text":"The service was great. Friendly staff. The food was very fresh. The guy who took our order was attentive and super funny!! This location exceeds the others that are nearby. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I want to say that Panda Express makes very good healthy tasting fast food, way more healthy to eat there than burger joints."}
{"text":"Came by last night with my boyfriend, and as usual the employees have closed up shop by 9:30 (although the restaurant is open until ten) and so we decided to try the drive thru. Big mistake. It's now 11:43 the following day and he's currently lying here off work, ill in front of me. It was within an hour of eating but half the meal, that he was vomiting, and didn't sleep at all throughout the night. Wish these stars could go negative. Beyond the unprofessional and completely lazy staff, THE FOOD iS NOT BEING KEPT AT TEMP! PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK! BEWARE!   And to the night staff of this establishment - you should be reprimanded or fired for your carelessness. He's pointed out after reading the recent reviews that he's not the first to get sick for your simple minded laziness and low self standards."}
{"text":"Great food, stuff very friendly but the floor tiles thru out the place very disgusting that should be cleaned once every 6 months total turned off how come the healthy department don't see that?"}
{"text":"You would think that food served from any Panda Express would taste similar. Not sure how this place achieved any higher rating.  Really disappointed in the service and food.  Definitely don't recommend this outlet."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star I just got food from there for $114 and the when I got home the food was old, cold, and just made you sick. my kids got sick instantly and had bad stomach aches. I went and took my food back and they didn't want to refund me my money and we didn't even eat any of the food. The servers April and Yolanda tried to lock us out when we went back to return the food and when we went inside she instantly started yelling at us and threatening us. We told them that all we wanted is to get our money back. The manager barley spoke any English and was telling us that there is nothing she can do and that she will not give us the money back. And the servers Yolanda and April were yelling at us and saying that they will call the police if we do not leave the premises. Yolanda and April both need to be fired because they are disrespectful and give Panda Express a bad name. This is not the first time I get food from Panda Express but this location is just terrible."}
{"text":"Loved the New Honey Sesame Chicken then they stopped offering it - really disappointed. Back to the same old offerings as before. I don't get it.  A little better at keeping the trays filled."}
{"text":"Horrible service and all the food is stale and dry. Dirty place. You don't typically expect fine dining at a panda, but this is an all time low."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already. Pretty decent Chinese food, no real complaints there. Only Issue that brings this rating down is their drive-thru. There was never a time I went to this specific location and waited less than 20 min in the drive thru. Just got back from a 30 min wait and it was rather frustrating. Just don't understand it. I feel like they make smaller portions of food and don't make anymore when it runs low? Idk. If they fix this issue, it's an easy 4/5"}
{"text":"We had a great experience coming here. It wasn't too busy and the ladies helping us were extremely nice and considerate. The food was decently priced, we spent about $30 for three of us. Their orange chicken is amazing and they have a large selection of other choices. Serving sizes are really large however, and I ended up taking most of my food home afterward. Other than that it was a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I wish I can give no stars, this place was terrible and so was the food the lady wasn't listening. We asked three times for some mandarin sauce we asked the last at the counter once and she was perfect but the lady named Daisy taking orders is rude an ruins you're day. when we open the boxes it's all a mess and the looked old & awful. 1st and last time customer to this location."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. The drive through seems to rush a bit much and my 3 to go orders the liquid sauce was in the bag by the time I hot home. I will ask for sauce to be put in a different container I guess."}
{"text":"This location is very well run. The food is always fresh and the service is very good. The restaurant is clean and everyone is friendly. We tried the peaking pork and it was very good. Might me a new favorite. It has a great tangy flavor. If you like orange chicken you might try the peaking pork."}
{"text":"Still not a huge fan but I used to be even less of a fan before this last trip.  Got dragged here by a friend and at least now they are trying to make a few healthier options.  Chicken still tasted really fake and salty and still don't plan to come back but not all terrible."}
{"text":"Over spring break my family and I decided to go to Scottsdale, AZ. And we were hungry so one lunch we went to Panda Express, and what a bummer, I think this is Panda Express at its lowest. In a restaurant you should have the ability to choose what you want to eat, not have them altered by lack of supplies. Personally The service was \"OK\" at best, but the main killer was the quality of the food. I found various burnt chunks of Chow Mien on my plate. Also when served orange chicken (my favorite) the lady gave me less than 1/4 a scoop and piled the crap out of my plate with fish (which lacked any sauce making it way to fishy) Where I live there is a Panda about 1/4 the size of that restaurant that knocks it out of the park every time. But you shouldn't base Panda Express of this one review. Maybe you'll have better luck."}
{"text":"By far the worst Panda Express me and my fiancé have ever been to, we walked in 2 full hours before close and they had no more chow mein, no more veggies, no orange chicken and then I looked further down the counter and all the trays were gone for the rest of the food. They stated itd be 5 min for the chow mein and 5 additional for the Orange chicken. The cook looked like he just chuckled and walked in the back. I had questioned to myself why the gentleman before us seemed so angry and left and now I know why. We walked out behind him."}
{"text":"The chicken I got here had a hint of what seemed to me of burnt plastic. I couldn't quite figure it out. The vegetables I got (rather than rice and/or noodles) didn't seem to be cooked correctly like at other Panda Express locations.   Service was good, everything went smoothly there."}
{"text":"The manager of this location is Amazing. He goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied with your order. I have had special requests and he has ALWAYS filled my requests with no hesitation. Thank you to the manager of this location for your ongoing exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"5 pm on a Sunday- food was disgusting. Cold and dry lo mein and grit on my chicken. Also doesn't help that a woman who must have been a manager or a veteran there was rude. No wonder this place barely had anyone there.  My friends and I must have come at a bad time because our food looked NOTHING like what's in everyone's pictures. Hopefully your experience was better than ours! :)"}
{"text":"Went here on Monday and got orange chicken and Beijing beef... Figured I'd have a cheat day from my diet and this was literally the only thing I ate all day... Not by choice. The same night I got violently ill which continued into the next day. I called to let them know and the girl on the phone was very rude and actual argued with me! I don't recommend this location at all. BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this location.. new chef maybe? The food is always Burt and cold! Never going back to this location"}
{"text":"What made it great was the smiles on the faces of the employees. Especially the cute girl at the register, because she just was incredible at satisfying all that I wanted from panda on numerous occasions."}
{"text":"Went there today with my kids the manager was so rude and could careless what the food looks or tastes like. The teriyaki chicken is always burnt after they chop it up they leave the scraps on the counter.  I went to use the restroom only to discover that the toilet would not flush thank goodness I only had to pee! When I mentioned it to the manager she just shrugged it off. This place is an embarrassment to our neighborhood! !"}
{"text":"Terrible, greasy food. It's offensive to call this Chinese food. The only good thing I can say is it's cheap and fast. Do yourself a favor and avoid this franchise and find a local mom and pop Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible, greasy food. It's offensive to call this Chinese food. The only good thing I can say is it's cheap and fast. Do yourself a favor and avoid this franchise and find a local mom and pop Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This panda is bullshit. They stop making food an hour early because they want to clean and when you come they say \"Want to know what we have left?\" What kind of custumer service is that. It's not like the damn chicken comes out of their paycheck. Can't believe this. Less than 0 stars."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this Panda location. Food is excellent! Price is very reasonable. Very good sized helpings. Fresh & delicious! Very clean restaurant. Friendly staff.  Healthy \"fast food\".  Its not fast food,its really nutritional & deliscious! Im a big fan of Panda here in Ohio,Ca & other states. Been eating Panda for over twenty years. You'll be addicted from the first time!"}
{"text":"I recently received a very nice letter from Panda Express in regards to my first bad experience at this location.  The corporate office included 2 gift cards for free entrees and asked that we try the location again.  We decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt and returned.  We showed the server our gift card and he was not sure what it was for.  He showed it around to several other employees and gave me about 2-3 ounces of orange chicken in a to go box.  I had planned on eating in, nobody bothered to ask.  I won't be back, I'm very disappointed but will happily spend my money locally at Chen's Garden or Seoul Garden right down the street.  BTW, the food this time was substandard and if I could give no stars, I would...."}
{"text":"I stopped by the drive thru to get my lunch. I came back to work and the first thing I see is hair on my food. I drove back immediately to get it sorted out.  I asked for a manager and I was told the manager is currently not available. I advised the lady in the drive thru the reason why I came back. She said she will replace my food.  I asked for my food to be replaced AND my money to be refunded. They said they can't do that. So I got my money back and wrote this review.  When you're in the food service industry, you need to empower your people to resolve matters such as hair on their food!!!"}
{"text":"The item I wanted when I went thru the drive thru wasn't available, the black pepper chicken, which was fine, it happens sometimes. So I picked 2 other items that were, the sweetfire chicken and the honey walnut shrimp. after paying for my items, the lady at the window asked if I wanted some soy sauce, I said yes and then asked her for some rice wine vinegar. She then said, what is that? now I don't know if y'all sell that at all, but I enjoy a sauce similar to that at my local Chinese delivery place. I don't know your menu selections because frankly I have only been to a panda express once or twice before... Now back to the order of food when I got home.... Well, both of the items I selected were very soggy with cooking oil, every bite I took just flooded my mouth with an oil taste not the flavor of the sauces I was expecting. The chicken had pieces that were nothing but breading and very hard. The chow mien noodles were even really oily and not cooked properly, they were hard to chew, rubbery. It was overall very disappointing to me. I don't think I will return to this store anytime soon.. I'll stick to my favorite delivery place, they are cheaper in price, and the quality and quantity of food is great."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but we go here all the time so I thought it was about time..  We always get good food. My husband doesn't really like Chinese food but he loves the Orange Chicken and the Honey Walnut Shrimp. Be sure to ask for the fortune cookies as sometimes they have forgotten but they sure made up for that the next time!"}
{"text":"Gotta love open signs but doors locked. There were still cars in the drive thru. Pulled on the door assuming they were still open since it was 5 minutes to closing and got flipped off by the employee inside. NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"Every now and then I like to come to Panda Express to eat my usual, the difference between this location and others is downright obvious! Some friends and I walk in, we were greeted once we began to order. whatever. I told the First Lady on the line what I wanted and it was fine. But once I had the second person on the line, which I believe her name was \"NATALIA\" everything went downfall from there. I asked for double orange chicken and I'm not kidding you she gave me 4 large pieces of chicken! While she was there gossiping to her other coworker about who's going to break next like standing there scooping up food isn't a break already! Not only that but they also don't bother asking if I want some egg rolls or cream cheese ragoons. Once I asked for an egg roll they immediately put it in the bag and charge my friend about 35$ and when I got home I didn't have any sweet and sour. Not to mention the person in front of us paid for a side and they didn't even put it in their plate!! Don't waste your time coming to this not properly trained staff. I don't need to hear about your gossip just give me what we pay for. If I were you guys I would properly RE-TRAIN Natalia on her mannerisms and customer service!"}
{"text":"We've ate there three times in the last two months. Each time the food my wife and I had was worse than the time before.  They are only a few blocks from our house and I kept hoping it would improve because the location is so convenient for us.  This is far the worst Panda Express we've experienced.  Food quality/taste is from fair to yuck. The orange chicken I ordered was old, tough, and dark, without a hint of orange flavor.  They not only don't throw away their old entrees, but I actually saw a server mix the nasty orange chicken into a new batch as we were leaving!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Just had best experience here so wanted to share in case mgmt reads these. Tonight's staff was extremely fast and friendly. Wish experience was always that solid!"}
{"text":"Fair prices considering being inside of a casino. The food was delicious and fresh, something not many Chinese food places offer. The thing that really made my experience amazing was the service. I never yelp, but after Shamil and Irvin's service I just had to acknowledge them."}
{"text":"Orange chicken we ordered tonight taste more of vinegar. Made my husband and parent's tummy upset."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a handful of times and all visits have been constantly the same with fresh, fast and friendly service. let me add the employees here are very friendly id have to say one of the best service i have gotten from any restaurant."}
{"text":"I just recently went to this Panda two days ago with my boyfriend and my Sister because I was really in the mood for it. I always fill out the survey to get the one free extra entree, because why not right? This time around though after I looked at the receipt to go and enter the survey info, did I realize that they really screwed it up. I had walked away and my boyfriend paid so he wasn't in tune to the fact that the price was way off.  I'm not sure if the girl that put our food in the to-go containers was new or if they just rang it up wrong but on my order I was charged extra for something I didn't even get. I was charged the extra 1.25 for a premium entree that I didn't order, so when I went to use my free survey entree, it only saved me .25 cents. So that was kinda sucky.  However, the food was all fresh. The portions were right and it always tastes great. So not a total bust on this trip, but I would like the employees to pay better attention and not charge customers for things they never received."}
{"text":"They are so stingy with the food its not even funny. Then you gotta pay 1.25 extra for fuvr pieces of shrimp rice tasted old I'll never come here again and will tell my ci workers not too either"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a number of times, and due to portion size inconsistencies and poor attitude to go with it, I now go out of my way to visit a different location. This afternoon my daughter's boyfriend stopped in to pick up food for the two of them around 4pm.  Robert O. gave him VERY small portions, and when he asked the manager what he was paying for, he was told he received the proper portion servings. Really? Half a bowl is the proper serving now? It sure hasn't been in the past.  You're going to see in the photo I post exactly what she got for her money.  Again, this location is _never_ consistent with their portion sizes. Everything comes down to who serves you. This comes from personal experience, btw.  Anyone who has been to Panda Express more than once knows full well half a bowl being the proper portion size is absurd. Maybe since he was answering to a teenager at the time, he felt short serving a couple of kids was OK.  Too bad you've done it to me as well, and I'm calling you out for it. Hopefully now, the kids will avoid this location as well. I'm writing this review just in case you're considering going here, in which case it's worth your time to try another spot if you're looking to get what you pay for at the very least. Maybe you'll get some consistency and a good attitude to boot. Might be time to step this complaint up a notch..."}
{"text":"I stopped at Panda Express during my visit to the Venetian during the holidays.  I had never experienced anything like it. There was a young woman texting on her cellphone while I waited for help. Two people waiting for assistance, a gentleman in front of me and I. I am an avid texter so I decided to be patient while she went on texting.    Much to my surprise, a young man arrives (in Panda Express uniform) and starts kissing her. It was more than the average kiss...lol! She turns to the counter and a bit frustrated makes an attempt to take our orders.    By this time, I'm already contemplating just walking away a few more steps to the other food vendors, when a very nice Asian woman comes to the rescue and starts taking our orders. The food was great.    I know it's fast food Panda Express; I do not expect red carpet treatment here but the kissing part was a little extreme lol! For that reason, I am giving it 2 stars."}
{"text":"This is the worst panda express location there is! We literally drive 4 miles out of the way to a different one, even though this one is closer. Last time we went they were out of fried rice, chow mein, black pepper chicken, and a couple other entrees. When I asked how long it would be for them to make the rice, chow mein, black pepper chicken they said 7 min. Thankfully I thought to ask 7 min total, or seven min each? She said, with attitude, like I was stupid, \"7 min each one.\" I said \"So I'll have to wait at least 20 min?!\" She rudely said \"Ya, so do you wanna wait?\" They only had two other customers in there, so they weren't super busy either. We drove out of the way to the one on Gilbert and the San Tan 202. Their food was fresh and their customer service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"The reviewer Danielle is the worst kind of people, walking in at closing time and being offended at people cleaning. I can just see them walking into a restaurant and saying \"what time do you close? *hostess*\"10:00\" Danielle* \"OH! Thank goodness we got here at 9:55!!\"  How dare you give people a bad rating for doing a good job.   And for the people who read this review far enough to inquire about the 4 star rating, it's just like every other Panda Express in the country... Same recipe, same food and CLEAN!   So if you are looking for a Panda Express that is different or dirtier from every other Panda Express you have ever been to, this is not your place."}
{"text":"YUCK  gross food Beef was rock hard the fried rice was way over cooked Well it is fast food  Note to self.....Don't waste time or money here again"}
{"text":"Short Version:  1st visit offered bad service, no value and I was waaaay over charged.  My $8.80 two entree meal became an $11.80 one entree meal for no observable reason.  Terrible experience.   Long Version: I clearly should have read these reviews BEFORE trying this place. I will spell it out. Hash-Tag-Fail.   The generic \"Chinese\" food was well....generic.    The silly format of ordering was not explained well. Panda Express makes you select \"entrees\" not proteins.  I'm not sure they understand what entree means.  Also, that's a french word, why are they employing it in a chinese restaurant?  I just said that I wanted one protein(shrimp), some veggies and some noodles.  Seems like a reasonable selection for chinese food.  The minimum \"entrees\" you can order are 2.  Since I only wanted one protein I thought there would be a cheaper option.  I was wrong.  They just substitute the tiny scoop of broccoli in place of a beef or chicken option.   Ok fine, that's just the way the menu is set up.  Terrible, but it's the way it is.  It's only $8.80 anywyas...EXCEPT!  then they charged me an EXTRA $1.50 for the shrimp I selected as my one protein.    To recap, I have chosen less items then they are charging me for PLUS paid a premium for the one \"entree\" I did select.  When I brought this to the attention of the staff they just looked bewildered and said that's just the way it is.  On top of this, the lady behind me had some sort of mix up and they immediately gave her a free entree voucher!!  Are you kidding me?!?!  What ever...I will not come here again.  Lesson learned.  If that wasn't enough as I finished eating, (who I assumme to be) the manager brought 3 staff members out to the dinning area and sat them at the table beside me.  He then began to discuss HR problems about how the feud between the two useless girls up front had started to affect the customers and service.    I only have a 1/2 hour for lunch otherwise I would've just joined in on the meeting.  It's not like they cared about employee privacy in any way.    I made a mistake choosing this place to eat.  They are doing me a favour in the long run I guess by encouraging me to just make my own damn food.    Thank you for being Terrible Panda Express."}
{"text":"This location is clean, especially the restroom which is immaculate. The team members are helpful, friendly, and professional. When we walked in we were greeted genuinely, and this location is busy, 2 customers when we walked in and a line after us that lasted til we sat, ate, then left, WOW! The team members were great showed no signs of stress, just smiling faces, helpful and sincere, Food kept being filled in the warmers. We had the noodles, kung pao chicken, spring rolls, and a drink, The food is delicious as always, served hot and flavorful. Panda is NEVER a disappointment! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I don't know what their deal was this time. Usually the food was good. My husband order our normal meal that we get from Panda Express. When my husband got home and we started to eat dinner, I spit the food out of my mouth. I could not finish my meal. My husband food was poorly made as well. He told me that the customer service was piss poor. The employees rushed and did not even care what my husband had too say. I  been throwing up for over 20 minutes now, with only 5 minutes break. The manager needs to do a better job in  training his employees and properly serving the food so people don't throw up after eating the food."}
{"text":"Went to this panda location to pick up supper on 2/10/17.  Had a 10 to 15 minute wait just to order. Most of the serving dishes were less than half full to empty. I order a child's meal and added a side and a panda bowl and added a side. This wasn't the first time I'd ordered food like this. When I was asked to pay, even though I was still waiting for food the the add on side for the child's meal was missing. The girl cashiering proceeded to tell me that the side I'd put with the child's meal was added to the panda bowl and if I wanted the second added side that was missed I'd pay full price since it was now on a separate ticket. The extra item should have been $1.50, but instead she told me it would be $4.31. And this after having to wait 10 to 25 minutes for food because the items ordered were depleted and the next serving wasn't ready. I'd gone on 2/3/17 and ordered the exact same food with no problem.  This was very poor customer service. Won't go back to this panda again."}
{"text":"I loved the honey-walnut shrimps! Dint know this flavor works so perfectly with the shrimps. Yum!"}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Fresh veggies and pretty good fast food. Usually pretty quick and always tasty. Love crab ran goons."}
{"text":"One of the best panda's I've been too staff is very polite. The food taste a little better here for some reason they also always give me a little extra, maybe because I'm just bigger or the way I Lick my lips when I say black pepper chicken please.."}
{"text":"good food and fresh. but amount of food is becoming lesser and lesser each time i visit.  usually chinese food have really good servings."}
{"text":"Granted, this is a chain restaurant and is pretty standard American Chinese fare, it is the best option for Chinese food that we have nearby. I have never had any major complaints, just that the fried items sometimes aren't very hot. I LOVE their noodles and wish I had the recipe."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service by a racist Asian associate called Maria. Had a horrible attitude towards me while I was ordering my food.  Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Usually empty on Saturdays for lunch. Quick and easy service and the kids love it. There is certainly better Chinese to be had, but for a simple and quick lunch, this place is clean and efficient."}
{"text":"Poor quality. Poor flavor. Poor experience. The chow mien is chewy. Orange chicken is tough and not enough sauce. You can add teriyaki but it's not the same as the sauce you ordered. I tried twice. Won't be back to any location."}
{"text":"Ordered a bowl today and there were 4 pitiful little pieces of chicken in it. Normally I get the 2 entree and there is more than enough chicken and vegetables with the fried rice side that I end up with extra, this meal cost more than what I think it was worth."}
{"text":"We went during a busy lunch hour and they weren't lacking any options! The staff is great, and the manager was super nice!  I'm from the States and love Panda down here. I gotta say, this Panda Express was a lot cleaner and more modern than 99% of the ones in the States. xD  Portions were similar to the US, and everything tasted the same.  Great job:)"}
{"text":"This Panda Express gave me food poisoning after ordering orange chicken/teriyaki chicken combo. I called and spoke to manager Ping who offered two free meals for the inconvenience. 2 weeks later I called to verify this is the case and she denied the original offer. My suggestion is to not eat here unless you want to get sick, and then deal with a liar for a manager who is supposed to fix the problem and not make it worse. Hats off to you Ping! The health department will definitely be notified of your bad food you serve."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda Express location I have ever been to. The staff were fine, it was the food that was a big disappointment. You could tell it wasn't fresh & had been sitting there for hours. It didn't taste good & the shrimp were soggy. The staff did give us extra orange chicken when we complained about the shrimp which was nice, but even my kid asked why did the orange chicken \"look funny\". We'll ever return to this location."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever at this particular Panda Express.  My brother and I went in to grab a quick lunch to take home to our wives.  My sister-in-law loves the black pepper chicken there, so that is what we ordered.  The server looked and saw that he was out of that dish, so he asked the cook to make another batch of it .  The cook smiled at him and then said that he did not have the ingredients to make it.  The cook decided that he would rather continue organizing ingredients, take things to the fridge, and do prep work than make food for his customers.  I am pretty sure the cook LIED to us.    We asked him what ingredient they were out of, and he couldn't tell us.  We let him know that if he was unwilling to make more of the dish that we would be reporting him to his manager.  He was very rude and he told me that he couldn't hear me even though I was talking very loudly in a close proximity to him.  Normally, we would just pick another item, but because we felt we were being lied to."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Panda express. While it is a chain, all Panda Express locations are not created equal. They make sure everything is always fresh. A few times I go there and order something that looks less than fresh, and they always take my order, throw out the non-fresh item I just ordered and make it right then. It may take a few moments, but I never have to ask them to make a fresher batch, they can see as well as I can, and I like that."}
{"text":"It's alright.  Food sometimes looks like its been in there for hours! Even at dinner time! I work next door so I come to GVR for dinner often. It's my least favorite option.   Oh and if you like steak and shrimp expect to pay a $1 each for each item. And don't expect a good portion either. Pay extra for less! Give me a break. Capriottis or Fat Burger or Tropical Smoothie are much better options while visiting the food court at Green Valley Ranch Hotel & Casino."}
{"text":"Solid, delivers everytime. I recommend the orange chicken. Its great while you get your holiday shopping done to visit Asia."}
{"text":"NASTY, don't eat here. Regret every penny spent here. Food was old, fried rice looked like its from yesterday, asked for white rice instead and was still dry and old. Chicken choice barley had chicken. Dirty place, stay away. McDonald's next door is better choice."}
{"text":"Got food last night and when got home was missing food and then my orange chicken was like a nuke warm. Called store and no one would answer phone. Online shows store closes at 9 on a Sunday. Called store today and spoke to Gio claimed to be manager told him about time and he says he was there last night and they close at 10. Hmmm better check your store hours again. When I told him about egg rolls missing he becomes rude and says do you have your receipt after I had given him the order number from receipt. When I told him the 8 orders of orange chicken I got was a cold he asks do you still have the food, I need it back to replace the it for you. No I don't have it threw it away 1 not knowing how long it sat there if its cold and 2 not taking chance of getting sick. When asking for his boss he says I can't give that to you and when I said take my info and have him call me he says no that's not our policy. Very very poor customer service not trying to make anything right but replace 2 eggs rolls for me!"}
{"text":"OMG I can't believe Panda Express is here.  The orange chicken is to die for!  They closed the ones in the malls in Niagara Falls NY and I thought I'd never get it again.  I can't wait to go...il. Be there every week :)"}
{"text":"Service/staff was terrible, food was cold, a lot of food was unavailable. I have eaten at a lot of pandas in Arizona and by far this is the worst one yet."}
{"text":"Basically it is just an average Panda Express. The staff can't speak English. Food is basically average and that's about it."}
{"text":"Need to have staff scheduled more effectively. For example, the people in front of us placed a HUGE to go order. There were three people covering the floor, and I just think it would have been more effective if another employee could take the next customer in line instead of have them decompose a few hundred lightyears behind the ppl with a mega to-go order.  Orange chicken at this place was dry, lacking sauce, and way too crunchy with a slight hint of burn.  Sweet Fire Chicken (?) was pretty good though. Seasoning, sauce, freshness, and texture felt just right."}
{"text":"Goooood! I was so happy when I found Panda Express in Toronto! I was addicted at Panda Express when i was in the state. I missed here so much. I had Chow mein noddle, Honey Walnut Shrimp and Orange chicken my ultimate 3 favorite in Panda express.  It was delicious!!!  The good thing about here is the food is already prepared warm and fresh so all I need to do is choose:) Reasonable price and lots lots of portion. I would come back when I have Chinese food urge or just want to have quick and simple take out food.  Friendly staffs :) you can try sample of menu if you are wondering about taste.  Yay!"}
{"text":"It's 10:55 and they open at 10:30 today. I have worked in fast food/restaurants before and know that the staff does not get there RIGHT before it opens so there is no reason that steamed rice shouldn't be ready by almost a half hour into the establishment being open, in addition there are 7 empty entree dishes in the serving windows"}
{"text":"slow slow slow service. If you got 45 minutes to waste standing in line come here. Staff makes no effort in trying to hurry up. Not worth my time."}
{"text":"Went through the Drive-thru today.  Not very impressed with the customer service.  The cashier didn't greet me, and she was annoyed that I asked her to repeat my order.  No utensils in bag for a $40 order."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Panda Express a couple of times and the last couple of times the food hasn't been that great, The orange chicken has been hard and didn't taste that great compared to other panda express I've been to.The Beef also didn't taste like it use to.  The line is always out the door and the portions aren't as great as other places. The staff is very nice and friendly though."}
{"text":"8:22pm We don't have enough food for you. Go away this is all we have. Nice job.  If you're going to be open for another thirty eight minutes, you might want to consider making some more food."}
{"text":"Well, generally, we kinda like Panda Express but at this location when we walked in at 8:45pm, the supervisor practically grimaced at us. They were already sweeping and mopping up although they are open til 10pm. A section of the restaurant was even sectioned of for cleaning limiting our viewing of food choices. OMG!! Now they are actually running a floor buffer and there are people in here dinivg! The supervisor couldn't looked more displeased at having patrons if he was walking on a bed of nails behind the counter. Only in Vegas, baby."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Panda Express. The service is great and all the staff does an amazing job. They are all so friendly and attentive. Very clean and well managed ! I live near another location but I don't mind driving a little further for complete satisfaction !"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick meal after hearing about the new shiitake kale chicken breast. I didn't see the outrageous prices until it was too late. I got a bowl and it was about $8, my brother got a 3 entree plate that came out to about $13. These crazy tourist prices are only reasonable in Vegas. We did ask for free samples and got them which was a relief because I heard a lot of complaints about no free samples. The food was delicious as always, but the bill was not."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Panda Express. The store is very clean and the food always seems to be freshly cooked. All Employees are very nice, and hey seem happy to be working there. On the plus side, they cut and organize their veggie really nicely. I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest serving panda express I have ever been to. Four different visits here and every time it took more then 20 minutes to get through the drive thru. VERY slow."}
{"text":"Very poor selection and it was sitting out too long.  The food trays were either completely or half empty.  It wasn't a good experience we couldn't even bring ourselves to consume anything. Don't bother for a while. They have a lot of kinks to work out."}
{"text":"Good customer service but bad food. I now it's not a premium food but still the rice was too dry and old , shrimp kinda old and bad looking. I had so many better pandas."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and fresh food.  Orange chicken Is always the bomb."}
{"text":"The food was good, the cooks are always smiling at everyone,  but the cleanliness of this place was awful! I sat at a dirty table and i wiped it off on my own then i couldn't even sit my child on the high chair because it was so sticky and dirty I sat him on my lap!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp (my fave) and it seemed they gave me a little extra since they were about to put out a fresh batch. Thank you. It was the best part of the meal and made my night."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. I have had repeated problems every time I go here. I am DONE!!!!  Everything from slow service to cold food wrong orders and RUDE employees. I have tried to call to let upper level management know and nobody seems to care because it never gets better. So I am taking my business to Li's Bowl on 35th and southern. Great food that's FRESH and nice employees. See ya Panda anything but Express."}
{"text":"I came to this Panda Express located inside the UNLV student union building multiple times already. The food is fresh, and the staff is ok in general. They are quick, efficient, but no smile at all. I know they are trying to get the service done as soon as possible, but I just had a very bad experience with the cashier. I decided to skip my lunch because I did not want to spend $7.58 for this crap. He is rude and does not listen to people's question, and all he is trying to do is to get you out of the way. I understand he is probably  just a student and work there part time, but this is just not right. Not sure if I am coming back again."}
{"text":"Good Panda Express. The location is convenient, the employees are kind, and, best of all, FREE SAMPLES!!!!  I should also mention that the food is always fresh and that the Teriyaki Chiken is flawless. You won't regret stopping by for a meal."}
{"text":"Panda is always tasty and consistent food. The staff here is GREAT!      Team member Jasmine is a bubbly (enthusiastic), happy, welcoming hostess. She made us feel instantly welcome with her warm smile and friendly greeting. Offered us a sample and cheerfully took our desired order. She is a strong asset to your team."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't review a fast-food chain such as Panda, but the quality of the food (yes, for \"fast food\") and the service was so good at this location that I couldn't resist.  Panda Express is, of course, express Chinese food & \"it is what it is\" for that.  And what it is, generally, is quite satiating when you're craving Orange Chicken or Beef & Broccoli, etc.   The staff at this location were extremely friendly - everyone (even cooks in the back) said a happy (not forced) hello!  We stopped here later in the evening, so many of the trays were 1/2 full or less.  This didn't bother me at all, but the server asked if we wanted freshly made entrees, even for the ones still 1/2 full.  We didn't need it, but it was still quite nice to be asked so politely (on the contrary, I didn't get my entree of choice at another Panda Express location because the tray was 1/4 full and only contained remaining vegetables and no meat from the dish...the server did not ask if I wanted it freshly made).   ***Keep the receipt: you will get a free entree with the purchase of a 2-entree meal if you simply call in for a survey or complete it online.  You'll receive a code for your next visit & the cashier will deduct the price of an entree.  That's a $4 value for less than 5 minutes of time!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food, reasonable prices.  I eat here often."}
{"text":"I found a worm in my shiitake kale chicken! Never again...they actually asked if I'd like another plate...i loved this place till then. Check your produce. Tells me they don't wash before they store."}
{"text":"I have been going to this panda express since it's  Inception, it was a very family-oriented . I used to get high fives from a lot of the employees  shoutouts to Gerald probably no longer works there but he was probably your best cook .lately I have not been satisfied with the service orders have been not right or less than what they supposed to be also every Friday we get some guys from Goodyear airport they are European show up and they order online while they are in line at Panda Express makes no sense so that makes us the customers that show up 3-4 times a day have to wait 30 40 minutes we do not say anything but I finally have my wits ends with it I expressed my concerns to the manager and the best answer she had for me was \"thats the way they roll\" I also was owed a order of walnut chicken and kung pao chicken she briefly with no attention to detail look through the book and said I was not on there and her explanations there's nothing I can do for you and that's it.she never looked at me again or said anything this will be the last time I go to any Panda Express I know my 40 50 bucks a week to you guys does not mean anything cuz you got millions  on the customers but guess what you just lost one loyal customer and for the district manager George or Jose don't know your name exactly I think you should nip it in the butt"}
{"text":"It's Panda Express, so you pretty much know what to expect. Pretty decent, if a little greasy, food. However, this particular location is a bit unusual in that they don't give you free ice water like every other Panda does. Instead you're offered the chance to purchase overpriced bottled water."}
{"text":"I Will not be returning to this Panda Express.  The employees have obviously been told to give small servings of not only rice and chow mein, but especially the entrees. The two scoop plate is the equivalent of one actual scoop and when I asked  for more because the servings were small, the employees gave a haughty response. This has happened on my past two visits and with different employees so it wasn't just a fluke the first time. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptionally great, and the workers are just as good. There is a worker named Savanna who I see often whilst dining in to Panda Express. She has always greeted me with a   smile when I walk in. When i see her cleaning the tables or putting together bowls for customers, you can tell by the look in her eyes how much hardwork and dedication she puts into her job! 5/5 on the food but 10/5 for the workers!!"}
{"text":"Ordered half and half noodles and veggies with chicken.  One of the workers filled the bowl with noodles and veggies, then another worker who looks like the owner took over the bowl and right in front of us put some of the veggies back into their serving table trays.  A gesture to show the other worker that he might have given us more veggies than he should have.  Don't think this shows very well right in front of your customers.  Besides, the bowl wasn't even filled up in the first place.  Is it worth it to lose a customer for a couple of broccoli florets?"}
{"text":"This location is very close to our community so it is very sad to have to drive 20 minutes to a different location because the staff including managers at this location are so rude!! I've gone a few times because the food is ok but the staff and managers are so rude that this was our very last visit. Shameful to say the least. Not very clean with very sticky tables and seating. The soda machine area is always sticky and dirty."}
{"text":"We called ahead on Christmas Day to inquire about their hours.  We were told they would be open till seven p.m.  We arrived at 6:35, as they were locking their front doors, with about ten cars waiting in the drive through.  Their food is not as good as other Pandas, it is always MUCH spicier than any other Panda in AZ.  So now I have two reasons to stay away from this location in Buckeye.   Rice Garden inside Bashas on dysart is superior in all aspects."}
{"text":"Line moving slow. 15 mins to start ordering. Got order in and stood there while 4 people behind me in line were told to check out ahead of me while I waited for one of the 5 people working the line to cut chicken. Then was told an 8 minute wait for egg rolls. I passed at least a dozen restaurants to get here. Next time I'll go to one of those."}
{"text":"We treat ourselves to Panda Express about once a month.  Every time we go we always have a good experience.  Fresh food and clean atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service sucks. Waited 20 minutes standing in line."}
{"text":"Express Yourself By The Rue  My, my, my you're so predictable,  My little Panda,  Your calorie content should be criminal, Wear a bandana,  The words I speak could be biblical, Fish Called Wanda, If presented as evidence it'd be admissible, Join Tri-Lambda.   Free side of Thai cashew chicken, Today only, Blood pressure up, heart rate quicken, Ride on a pony,  Hot mustard behind the counter hidden,  Beef tastes phony,  On the board the prices are written, Cashier boney.   NOODLE!!"}
{"text":"Delivery Is Free But Not For Me By The Rue  Deliver is free, But not for me, It always cost a dollar fifty.  My poor Panda Express, You leave such a mess, In my heart and in my belly, Your food makes my breath smelly.  Bejing beef and spring roll, If you only knew the kind of toll, That your food took on me, I should have went to KFC.  Although I love you my poor Panda, You should hire more girls named Amanda, Four for four I regret eating you, When I burp the smell is pee-u.   Fin"}
{"text":"Yuck.  Avoid this Panda Express like the plague. I just got home to a cold, nasty order of Kung Pao Chicken.  It tasted like mush and seemed like it was days old.  My wife's orange chicken was orange bread.  If there was chicken in it, it was at microscopic levels.  The employees seem disinterested and bored.  I hate the thought of kids in Summerlin who get this crap for dinner from overworked single moms to stressed to cook.  It would make me hate Chinese food for life."}
{"text":"Hello people i order on drive true two bigger plate so when i got home and wife serve my childrems their meal we notice that our son 3 years old was eating a plastic that was found on their meal mix with the chow main i got scared because it seens that my son was chowing on the plastic it scared me thinking he would be eaten the plastic and something bad could happend to him this is the second time that has happend to me on same location. Civic center and chayane for sure never stoping at this location again"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. This location was very, very stingy with it's entrée portions, and the fountain drink was totally watered down. I doubt I will be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"The best Panda Express by far. The location is nice, big and very clean.The staff are very friendly especially Paula!!"}
{"text":"The employees here are really friendly!!!  I am REALLY picky about my food being fresh.... And they accommodated... No questions asked!!!!  I will continue to drive the extra distance for fresh food without attitude!!!  Thank you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"After seeing the Panda stare at me for a while, we finally had the opportunity to visit, and we were not disappointed. The food isn't gourmet, but it's good. It's a better and healthier version of Manchu Wok. I read the reviews and it seemed like they had a pretty slow start, but I think they are on their game now.   We went for lunch and pretty much all the dishes were available. The only thing we were running low on was stir fried vegetables, and even then, by the time our party of 5 ordered, the new batch of veggies was ready! It could have also been our fault as three of us ordered \"all veg\" as the sides instead of a veg/carb.   Their famed orange chicken is YUMMY! Also tried the sweetfire chicken (the one with pineapples) and the green bean and chicken dish. We enjoyed all of them and would definitely go back again.  Yay Panda!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Panda Express location that I ever been to. I frequent the one on ocotillo and Arizona Abe but being late for dinner and in the vicinity of this location, thought of giving a try. They Are open until 9:30pm everyday and I went in with my kids @ 8:00pm but they already cleaned out all the dishes and cleaning the kitchen. There was a beeline of customers wanting to order food and all that left is orange chicken and some steamed veggies. I ordered steamed veggies and the person behind the counter just shoved orange chicken in my bowl and closed it shut. I told her I don't want chicken but she just ignored me. My daughter ordered white rice and she just shoved fried rice in the bowl and shut. Repeatedly told her we didn't want it but she didn't care. She was talking to other staff on Spanish joking about us while we were still ordering. Overall, a very unsavory and rude staff ruined my files dinner."}
{"text":"The food is just okay here I don't feel like it should be a Mexican cooking your Chinese food I've had much better Panda Express elsewhere for some reason they're slacking sorry guys"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my call in/carryout order 2night.  They got our order for 4 completely RIGHT.  In the fast food service of 2016, this is RARE.  We were tired, hungry and, after devouring our fresh, hot, yummy Panda food....everyone was satisfied!!  Great food...great service!!  (Generous portions, too!)  Thanks, crew there at Panda 2night!!"}
{"text":"Food and service both OK.  Cheaper than the Panda Express in Chandler Fashion Center."}
{"text":"One of the best Panda Express I have ate at. Only one better was at ASU because no food would sit long enough to go bad. Food is always good, always fresh. Will drive out of my way to eat at this one even though I drive by a different one on the way home. I recommend this location."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It is always fresh and hot. They have great staff that provide fast service."}
{"text":"I LOVE coming to this restaurant!!!!! I like how all the staff are really nice and helpful and energetic. And there is a young lady name MARY!!! MARY!!! MARY!!!, EVERY TIME I come in to this restaurant she is always with a SMILE on her face and VERY FRIENDLY!!!! I just wanted to nominated her for a FABULOUS JOB SHE HAS DONE TO THIS COMPANY!!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from eating dinner here last night. Horrible! I had half chow mein/fried rice, orange chicken, and black pepper chicken with side of teriyaki sauce. And interesting that everyone I mention to that I ate at Panda Express and am now sick was not surprised!! Already 2 people said someone they know has gotten food poisoning from Panda before. Not gonna eat it ever again! Ugh"}
{"text":"Love the Panda!! Food is much better than you would expect for a national chain chinese. None of the dishes are bad and they are always ready to go..."}
{"text":"Recently drove thru ordered the broccoli and beef, fried rice and chow mein. When I got home opened the meal the broccoli was stinky, looked mushy and brown. The fried rice was old and not fresh. I brought the food back to receive an attitude from the cashier servicing the drive thru. There was no manager on duty at 8:43 pm. No one listened or answered any of my questions. I will never eat at Panda again on Blue Diamond the food is terrible and the service is worse than the food."}
{"text":"I love panda Express great fast food and Ice tea.....Just make sure you get it fresh."}
{"text":"The long was really long however it moved fast. I think there was about 8 people and I waited less then 5 mins. At the same time my husband was at another place in the same food court with less people and he waited a lot longer then I did. He was surprised when I came back to wait with him. The other thing I was impressed with when I asked if one of the entrees, Tso Chicken was spicy. The chicken egg roll was excellent as well. Melojane D who was serving me gave me a sample to try. That was impressive! Food was fresh, hot and tasty as if I had been at a sit down restaurant and it was made just for me. The chow mein was a tiny underdone but again fresh and guessing balance for sitting in a pan and not to become mush. Haven't been a big fan of Panda express before but will be going back there now when I get home."}
{"text":"Sometimes a bad employee can ruin a previously enjoyable experience. Vanessa is that employee. Panda Express was that experience. Every request is a Sisyphusian task, and eye rolls and groans and lack of verbal acknowledgement are key. Consider another location. I won't be spending my money here again."}
{"text":"This is another place I go for the iced tea more than food. Their passion iced tea is so great!"}
{"text":"Worst Location! Couldn't even finish our sentence when trying to order in the drive thru, employee was so rude, kept cutting us off, was not listening, and was messing around with the other employees. For the past 5 times we have been, they have gotten our order wrong, this time it was so bad we actually drove back to have them fix it, ughhh we should have learned to check it before leaving the drive thru! We will NOT return to this location, finally learned our lesson :("}
{"text":"Commercial Chinese. It's expensive for what you get and everything tastes the same. They do have a good chow mein though (actually lo mein but whatever). The people working there are always very unprofessional and have no problem carrying on a conversation between themselves even if they are helping you. Nearly 8 dollars for a 2 item combo with barely any food compared to a local run place is totally unacceptable.   Seriously, unless you're in a huge rush, and don't have a problem spending way more for food than it's worth, just go to a locally run American Chinese food joint instead, they are worth the wait and the price. Unlike Panda Express."}
{"text":"I recently went through the drive through during my lunch break and ordered a bowl with general tso's chicken and half fried rice and chow mein, after stating my order back to me I pulled up to the window where they told me they were giving me a discount on my food! I was so overjoyed at the surprise, that I didn't think to check the bag! They ended up only giving me a bowl with chow mein and fried rice in it, and albeit they did ring me up for only that - it was not at all what I ordered or what had been clarified to me. So when I called the store to explain what happened the manager was a total jerk and told me there was nothing she can do if that's what I ordered because I got what I had paid for...even though it's not at all what I ordered!!! I was not happy with the service because clearly the staff needs to work on not only making sure their listening, but also making sure they didn't leave anything out."}
{"text":"Quick and easy. A decent selection. It's a good spot for lunch. The only disappointing part was no pandas. I had my hopes up to see one. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I found this place when I was in Vegas. A Realtor took me there and would hav kept going back for two meals a day. It's kinda like a cafeteria style where you go down the line with a tray and pay at the end. Seating is comfy and decent atmosphere for a chain Chinese joint. But the food was different and seemed to take a lot of spins on my fav Chinese dish, General Tso's chicken. Love this place"}
{"text":"I don't know why I am giving them 2 stars. Maybe because of the service. Went there while shopping on Black Friday. Their food was not as good as the one on Thunderbird and 40th street."}
{"text":"I don't appreciate their portions I feel like when I pay my money I want as much meat as vegetables but they purposely give you more vegetables then meat and I don't know the reason why it's going to drive me away from panda express I hope they could change or maybe it's just this location. Don't expect to get your money's worth unless you speak up and they're still going to act like they can't do it. But the food is great."}
{"text":"The portions are not worth your money and i do not and would not recommend this Panda express to Anyone. they're customer service was fine but the portions they will give you will definitely turn you around. wish i didn't spend my money here and won't spend anymore here in the future"}
{"text":"It's a very mis-managed location. They have employees sitting in the dining area taking us much of the (precious little) table space. And they don't have bags to carry the food - this is an airport location after all. Not ok to hand over bunch of containers with no bag to take into the plane."}
{"text":"Watch very carefully at this location what you are charged and count your change back! EVERY TIME I go through the drive through there is an issue with either what I was charged for or the change I was given back. I went there recently & ordered a 2 item entrée & had the survey from the receipt giving me 1 extra entrée. The girl at the drive through repeated the order back to me & said she would have my total at the window. I pull up to the window & she says, \"That will be $7.20\" which was the price of a 2 item entree so I gave her my receipt for the free entrée & a $10 bill. She gave me back 60 cents! Well since I already knew to be on alert for the wrong change I said, \"Where's the rest?\" And she said, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"I gave you $10 & you said my total was $7.20 & you gave me back 60 cents so where's the rest of my change?\" so she says, \"Oh, hold on\", comes back & says, \"I forgot to take the $1.50 off for the extra entree\" & gives me $1.50. The receipt didn't even show that she took the $1.50 off, the receipt showed that I ordered a 3 item entrée. When I went to complain on the Panda Express website they didn't even show this store as one of their locations. Kind of weird............."}
{"text":"So the other night I came in at 9:59 and they close at 10.. I kept apologizing because I felt so bad but they served me quickly and without any attitude! They still had all the entrees available and none of them looked old or dried out. I've been there when a guest comes in last minute and it sucks when you have the preclosing/closing duties to do in a timely manner, and they were so helpful and nice. Food still tasted amazing and fresh. Just another reason why Panda is my fav :)"}
{"text":"When we walked in the restaurant was really clean. Windows were clean, floor was clean, restrooms were clean. Really friendly staff. Food looked freshly made. Store manager was very polite he asked how were we doing, he asked us if everything was ok with our service. Very helpful manager."}
{"text":"This location tends to have problems with the food. A lot of times I will have to wait for a new batch of food to be made because what they have kept under the heat lamps for who knows how long needs to be replaced. Typical Panda store. Considering the competition nearby I am surprised they stay in business here."}
{"text":"A disaster. Good food; horrible, horrible service. A lot of green kids in their first jobs operating with no direction. No communication between those working the counter and the cooks behind them. They kept running out of food and the poor girl doing the initial serving was sweet but desperately needs help. The line moved at a snail's pace. No one was cleaning the place. A lot of frustrated first timers who won't return. Where was management today or is management part of the problem. This place won't last unless it has an immediate turn around. Shame-- good food."}
{"text":"Flavor is lacking and food is rarely hot. Portions are usually good sized but it's still not worth the price."}
{"text":"First time last time..... Felt like I was South of the Border China? Did not take long to stop the line from moving....makes for cold dry food. Worst Worst Worst.... Pretty Building... Too bad it's doomed to close."}
{"text":"I was in line watching Mom and child....Mom ordered 3 Meals...Happy point was Watching Mom Keeping child from touching hot metal....And Watching Employee Staying Attentive.  Switched Person from Giving Huge Portions ...Why?"}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda I've ever been to. I've tried going there before and the wait  has always been too long and I would leave. Last night I went at 7 p.m. to pick up food for myself and my daughter .  Numerous people are sitting at tables waiting for food and warned me. No chow-mein in the bowl. No shrimp. They came out with chow-mein and started filling orders for people waiting at the tables. I asked how long it would be before the shrimp would be available and was told 5 minutes. I decided to pick up my prescription at CVS and came back about 20 minutes later. When I came in there was 11 people in front of me, it appeared 6 were in the group. The girl at the rice and chow mein was moving in slow motion and I assumed took their order. The girl left the station and NOBODY was THERE. She came back with a bunch of cardboard cartons and proceeded to start setting them up and writing on them. All the workers down the line away watched.  Looking around doing NOTHING but watch HER. NOBODY was assisting US. NOBODY.  I said something and they looked at me as if I was CRAZY. I had to leave a second time with no food, STARVING. I will never return. This place must only employ teenagers with no work ethic and actually no training or supervision."}
{"text":"It really sucks when you crave something and you're sick so you have your boyfriend go get your fav food and when he get home after the long 40min drive after picking it up some of the food was not cooked right"}
{"text":"I was on this side of the town for business with co-workers, went to this Panda Express location and my god this experience was horrible. Food did not look fresh, service was slow, associates did not have any energy to make us happy. What makes even worse, the regional manager name Aris was there and he didn't do anything about it. He looked stupid as hell, has no idea how to run a smooth operation in a fast food chain, he relies on other people to get his stuff done. A regional manager? I hope this asshole, store manager reads this and upper management fires his ASS!"}
{"text":"Came back to this place again for food, again excellent service amazing staff. One thing I want to point out though is this upper asian manager with no hat in a black shirt I think his name is Leo which I overheard, the one with a ugly mole on his cheek with a clueless expression. He is just walking around all stupid, looks all drunk and just bossing the associates around without knowing what he is saying while the others are working hard. Is that how upper management runs the store and communicates with the team? Somebody better think about him twice and replace him. I really want to punch him for ruining my experience and other customers while enjoying and standing up for the hard working servers."}
{"text":"the Orange German Shepard they make is disgusting and so is their Kung Pao Rottweiler."}
{"text":"I have given this place NUMEROUS chances since moving here almost a year ago, but when their hours are posted to close @ 9:30 (and I've worked in the Service Industry for 17 years), and they literally almost NOTHING to put over the chow mein @ 8:30 the 1st day & then 9:00 the 2nd day - IN A ROW...you really need some better management over this place. When I'm paying close to $10/plate - you might want to up your service. Totally poor."}
{"text":"Soy sauce should be a given! If you're going to ask me and I say yes, be sure to put it in the bag. Nothing worse then getting home and not being able to fully enjoy my panda.... Such a shame, 1 star"}
{"text":"Basically,  I went in for a quick take out and I got more than that, I got the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  There was only one person behind the counter and she was assisting a large order.  There were two other employees but they were socializing with people in the dining area.  I stood there and waited five minuted to be served.    Once served, the lady basically disregarded everything I said.  She stacked the food on top of itself so the sweet fire chicken was covered with the green bean chicken.  She scraped the bottom of the pan instead of getting the new tray behind her.  I pointed out the new tray behind her, she looked at it and continued to scrape the bottom of the tray to get every last ounce out.  God forbid I get any fresh food.  I stood and waited because I wanted pot stickers, she walked by and rung me up and seemed disturbed when I said I was still ordering.  By the way, got no pot sticker sauce but that's no surprise.  She rang me up and as I paid another employee yelled something at her to the extent of \"I guess you are in charge now.\"  She rolled her eyes and went back to providing me with no customer service.   Stay away at all costs. No customer service to speak of.   It was funny because the Cafe Rio near this Panda was packed and I didn't have time to wait.  Next time I will wait at Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this location. I had a feeling but I was hungry for rice and panda was coming up. So not to start off wi th bad customer service. The girl can barley speak English it was starting to frustrate me when she a kept asking the same question that I told her I can't understand you. Not helpful at all at this location."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many different Panda Express restaurants, in many different cities.  From what I can remember, this is one of the best.  So much so, after I ate here for the first time, I returned two more times in the same week (last week).  Food was consistent, fresh, and servers were always pleasant and efficient.  Shrimp is always easy to over cook, and can get tough after sitting in the steam table tray after a while.  The shrimp here was especially good for Panda.    I give it a 5 because it is great Panda Express food.  I'm not walking in expecting gourmet.  For the price, and convenience, and for a chain restaurant.  This one is run very well."}
{"text":"Girls at the front are soo rude the orange chicken was soo chewy! I will not be coming back to this panda it is rediculous the girls working there forget that a customer makes their check possible"}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews but this time i just had to. I have been to multiple panda locations, and this one just has to be the worst. Ive been here many times since its super close to my house and i always leave disappointed, but today was just ridiculous, i order a 2 entree plate with chow mein, orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp and got charged an extra 1.25 i paid 8.79$ which i did not mind thinking it was going to be good, when i got home i was really mad because i realized i got 3 pieces of shrimp that i paid 1.25 extra for, 4 pieces of chicken and a whole lot of chow mein!!!! I dont mind paying extra if i was actually getting a good amount of food not just a bunch of noodles! I will not be coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very calm especially for a lunch time. The staff were very friendly even to the customers leaving."}
{"text":"This location sucks.   I would love to know why the guy in front of me was offered fresh orange chicken while the rude lady serving the ordered scooped old orange chicken into mine. Seriously. I'm right behind him. I want fresh orange chicken too. Oh and I got it. After dirty looks from the rest of the employees. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this location many times, today they had a sign that due to the egg shortage they were trying  a new recipe for the fried rice and it is awful.  Beware if you have a corn allergy, they replaced the egg with sweet corn and supposedly some spices?  It was hard, dried out, and had no flavor.  Until they go back to the original recipe I will no longer eat here. The staff is great and if you are eating something other than fried rice the rest of the food is great."}
{"text":"My mom likes food here. They didnt wait that long when they ordered. The girl who served me is so nice and really took care of my order. Good job!"}
{"text":"This location is one of the worst Panda Express. (Food & Customer Service) Espeacially on weekends."}
{"text":"Not recommended.  9pm Wed nite. 50% or more entrees not available.  Ordered simple orange chicken because most bins were empty.  Nuggets were like rocks. Dry and flavorless. Customer service? There is none.  Rude, bored employees. If I was the owner, I'd spend more time here. You won't see me back here again. This wasn't the first time I ve been disappointed with this place, but tonite is the last."}
{"text":"Panda express is about as far away from \"authentic\" Chinese food as you can get but they have a few items that I just crave.  My favorite meal is Orange chicken, Beijing beef, and chow mein. If I don't have these for a while I really start to crave them. Other than the occasional order of potstickers that's all I like. The rest of the dishes I've tried have been just so-so in my opinion.  If you've seen one of their restaurants you've seen them all.  The things I have always disliked about Panda is they make you ask for soy sauce and napkins and they dole them out very sparingly. Nothing like asking for extra napkins and the guy hands you ONE. Gee thanks"}
{"text":"This place is always an issue, I have 30 mins to grab lunch and the last thing I want is a nasty attitude from the same lady in the drive thru. She will not let you say something without cutting you off. After telling her twice what extras you want and her cutting you off every time - you leave without said extras and wonder why do I keep coming back here.  Save yourself and drive over to Blue Diamond (those people are a true example of customer service)."}
{"text":"Not original not creative not unique and steals people's ideas the taste is 1 star the orange chicken taste absolutely nothing like oranges #shrimp toast     Jk love this place :)"}
{"text":"I used to be a PX GM, I am so impressed with the service, food quality, cleanliness. Everyone did a great job. So proud to say to my relatives who dine with me today, that I used to work for PX. Keep a great job The service"}
{"text":"I live close to the location on the 303 and Waddell but I prefer to drive to this one on bell. The people who work here go above and beyond. I've had nothing but good experiences and will continue to return."}
{"text":"Always get the honey walnut shrimp it's my fave! Wish it wasn't so pricey being that I have 2 sons that eat more than the typical person lol"}
{"text":"The absolute worst location I've dealt with yet. I decided to hold off writing a review after the first bad experience but now I've been there three times and every-single-time I've gone through the drive thru they've left out items I ordered and PAID for. So completely frustrating! I really tried giving them the benefit of the doubt but after this third time I'm done wasting money on them. Unfortunately with a 1.5 year old it's hard packing back up and driving back for the forgotten items and honestly, I shouldn't have to because this shouldn't keep happening. So disappointing and not worth giving them any more chances."}
{"text":"Slowest Panda Express I've ever been too and not even the manager apologized for the inconvenience. Then he only gave me barely any chicken at all. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Each time I have visited this location, the workers have been very rude and inattentive. The last time I went in, they were out of all kinds of rice. It was a Tuesday night around 6 so it was not busy, so how they ran out is beyond me. The workers were unapologetic about the situation and made me feel as if I had done something wrong by asking for rice (but seriously, a Chinese restaurant without rice?) I will not be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"Decent chinese fast food it all depends on what time of day you get there. When its fresh it gets a score of 5 and the other half of the time its not fresh and scores a tough to chew 1. During the non busy parts of the day they should make smaller portions and toss it once it starts looking sad, that would help even if they had to charge a little more throughout the day."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if possible i walked in at about 820 they close at 930 but they were already clearing out the items,  and what was left was next to nothing.  I think that the owners need to watch their staff carefully and make sure their product is actually being sold and fresh.  Mind you the lady that helped me asked for kung pao and told me it would be 5-6 minutes. Thr gentlemen who was cooking the food obviously doesnt know i understand Spanish so ill just smile as he asks whos going to make the kung pao.  That was 15 minutes ago and here i am sitting waiting for my food while my sons surprise takes longer than expected.    Now i normally do not write reviews bad or good but this experience was ridiculous. I will never come back here again"}
{"text":"As long as you get there at least an hour before closing, the foods consistently fresh, I've seen people have a fresh order made if you're extra picky too. Nice cheap fast Chinese food. Not much else to it."}
{"text":"Everyone works so slow and they're not attentive to how busy and how long the line is. I can write a 10 page essay before they're done scooping Chow Mein into the plate and I'm a college drop out."}
{"text":"Food was made to order due to start of dinner rush. Even though they were short staffed, they were super friendly and seasoned enough to handle the line w/out too long of a wait. Kudos to the lady who helped me. She was on it!"}
{"text":"This one star review isn't based on the food; It's Panda Express, fast and decent food, no complaints there. The issue was the service. Granted, its on the strip, it was wildly busy, long line; we waited our turn. It was very loud there, so it was a challenge to get our order in; I ended up with rice vs chow mein (which they did correct, and I appreciated that). The problem was with the cashier, Richard. I assume because of the noise level he was having trouble understanding our drink order; however, after two failed attempts to get the order right, he completely lost his cool and began repeating his questions to us in a very pissy tone of voice (the kind of attitude you take when you are talking to someone who you think is very, very stupid) without giving us time to respond. I eventually had to cut him off and tell him we were trying to order he just was not listening. At that point he stopped speaking whatsoever (other than a final, snotty \"thank you\") and finished the transaction. I am a general manager of a large retail store, and whenever I observe any of my associates behaving in this manner with a customer, I remove them from the selling floor and discuss what the issue is that is causing their inappropriate behavior and how to correct it. None of this happened at Panda; Richard simply moved on to the next customer with the same surly attitude. Now I am sure this location makes money hand over fist, and my one opinion wont matter to any of them in the least, but we will never give this store our business again, no matter how badly we are craving Orange Chicken. If you do give this store your business, avoid Richard at all costs.  His offensive belligerent attitude left a very bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"When it comes to chinse fast food panda express is the best! This location is no stranger to great service and awesome flavor!   I have been to multiple pandas as it is my all time faviort fast food place and I have to say that the service is not always the best. sometimes they are always in a hurry and just want to push you threw the line. Not here!!!  The crew was fast, friendly and all the food was fresh. We had to wait for the orange chicken but ussally when this happens we wait at least 10 min. But these guys were on it!!   You will not be disappointed with this lands. They even have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"The food is great and i love coming here, but lately there have been a few people working. I come here on my lunch break but by the time it is almost done my lunch is over! Its really upseting, this is my favorite store. The lines are also so long! I hope this store speeds up with more poeple, 2-3 arent sufficient enough. If nothing changes, panda express will be losing customers, like me."}
{"text":"My first clue should have been at 8 cars in the drive through,but no I went inside , because I was hungry. After waiting in line (inside) for 24 minutes they still gave me my order was wrong. In addition , while I was waiting the clerk was arguing with other customers. Even after that the clerk Melissa was rude to as hell to me as well. I'm sorry but it's not fault that this location is not organized and seems like they are all family that work there. My advice to the manager, is to really look  at your night shift crew and make changes. I won't be back here but at least do it for your other customers."}
{"text":"Food is Really bad. Went there for lunch.  I will never return.  Took two bites and threw out my rice and orange chicken.  Maybe I still have time to get food some place else. . . If I can't find another option in the time I have left on my lunch break I will just skip lunch altogether and wait until dinner time."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location a few times and every single time they mess something up! I go to this location for the sake of convenience but I will never go again! Last night my husband and I went and he orders the teryaki chicken with sauce ON the chicken as well as ON THE SIDE. The guy at the window repeated our order TWICE and still didn't put the damn sauce ON OR ON THE SIDE! One time I went through the drive thru the girl told me to pull around and park in front to wait for my order...20 minutes later I walked IN to the place only to find they forgot about me and hadn't even made my food yet. I was angry and spoke to the manager to give me my money back and she said all she could do was give me some free cheese rangoons. This location is bullcrap. I'm done giving this location chances to actually function like a real business."}
{"text":"Filthy! filthy! filthy! Brought the fan in at 4pm and I guarantee it hasn't been cleaned since opening. Had to sweep off (let alone wash off) our table, there were no forks. I'm sure I'll have explosive diarrhea as soon as I get home! What a mistake. This will be my last $40 spent at this site for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a panda with a line that never moves. This one wins.   Don't recommend eating here if you need to get in and out fast. The drive thru portion and the lack of manpower is why it's so slow here. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"This Panda is close to home, but has the poorest quality of the half a dozen or so Panda's I've been to. I really wanted some Panda so I gave it another try at this location and received an all time low with no shrimp in the surf & turf and really hot orange chicken on over cooked noodles (rubber)."}
{"text":"After much heartache (and heartburn for that matter), I have finally found a decent Chinese food restaurant... drum roll please... Panda Express.  Ironically it is a chain restaurant, but who the hell cares?  It has been quite the task trying to find good Chinese food around here... but here we have it... Panda Express.  So, let me elaborate... you walk in, and order from a counter where you can point to what you like... the food is behind glass in large metal dishes.  Everything was kept at a good temperature.  I ordered the sweet and sour pork, fried rice, and an egg roll with a drink.  They have a choice of different meal sizes, and you get your meal to go or stay.   The food was very good, especially considering this is a chain restaurant.  There is a good selection of different types of sodas/ice teas/lemonade to choose from (you get it yourself).  Some of their other entrees included the Orange Chicken, Tangy Shrimp, Broccoli Beef, and Mongolian Beef ~ all of which looked appetizing.  There is one part of my experience that was unpleasant however.  After searching and searching to find GOOD wonton soup in all of Arizona ~  After driving aimlessly up and down street after street looking for a decent looking Chinese restaurant that MAY or MAY NOT serve good wonton ~ After trying countless other wonton soups that just didn't meet up to my (probably unrealistic) expectations....  This has been a trying, troublesome process... but I thought, maybe, just maybe, Panda Express will shine their gleaming face in my direction.... NO, WRONG.    Why is this, you may ask???    Well, it's because they DON'T SERVE WONTON SOUP!!!!!  Yes, you are reading this correctly.  THEY DON'T SERVE WONTON SOUP AT AN F'ING CHINESE FOOD RESTAURANT!!!!!!  WTF???  Does anyone know what type of wonton soup I am talking about?  I used to get it at every Chinese food restaurant I ever went to back east (New Jersey).  It has a thin broth, with pieces of scallions and small strips of beef (just a few) and rubbery wonton noodles stuffed with pork.  I know it sounds nasty, but it's really good!  DAMN IT!  Ok, I need to relax.  Other than that, the place is great.  It's clean with nice atmosphere, great service, and good food."}
{"text":"I drive to this location from work, and sometimes short on time. They are quick to take care of customer, and food is fresh. Especially like the cleanliness of the restaurant. Had the chow mein, they had just put a fresh batch out. They are always cooking and making fresh batch. I noticed the person did not use the small amount left in the botton on the line, he waited a minute for them to bring the fresh batch. Very nice."}
{"text":"If I could rate at 0 start I would!  The asian WU that serves the food was very RUDE! she raised her voice telling me to hurry and chose my 3rd item.  Shes HORRIBLE and the definition of bad customer service.   I rather drive an extra mile to the next panda express."}
{"text":"Ordered 6 items everything was going smoothly until I ordered teriaki chicken. They were out so the Jing the supervisor told me that it will take about 6 to 7 minutes. I agreed to wait so all the food was already in container's and I was waiting for the teriaki chicken to be done. Twenty five minutes later the teriaki chicken finally was done. I talked with supervisor Jing and showed him my receipt and the time I waited. Meanwhile my food was getting cold. His attitude was he didn't care and that I was bothering him. I didn't want all the food to go waste so I asked for a discount. He offered me a $5 discount and 2 entrées for the next time. This isn't the first time they screwed up my order, in fact the customer after us asked for their food as well. They seem to screw their order up as well. I feel that a $5 discount is an insult and didn't care for 2 entrées for future use since I don't ever plan on returning to panda express. Very slow service mixed with a bad experiences equals me looking elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch,  I tried something new this time.  Tried to keep my selections vegetarian.  I ended up ordering chow mien, double order of veggies, and veggie spring rolls.  They also have put the calories on all their items on the menu It's fast food but Panda Express has been my favorite place to eat Chinese for years"}
{"text":"Very rude serving people. Stay away from this place. They hate you make them repeat their question even if it is already loud inside. They give you rude face and shout up to ask again. Very impolite personalities."}
{"text":"Bad service and food at all times. I tried giving them the benefit of doubt and try them again today at 4 pm.  If the foods bad at 4pm it will always be bad. I tipped the cashier a dollar and she still didn't get the sauces on the side and slammed window in my face before I had a chance to  check or say anything. I tried at lunch at  noon a week ago and it was the same. I think they are on the way out of biz. Prices raised and quality went down by far. I was my favorite."}
{"text":"Nice! But busy. Food is always good..very close to my house. Very convenient. Servise is usual. I like Panda Express"}
{"text":"Shout out to \"Karen\" for being rude as I asked politely for her service then fled behind the cooks. Once we paid for our food, she went back to her position and gladly and kindly helped other fellow customers. But the food was good."}
{"text":"Refused to give me what I ordered as well as give me a large cup of water.  They told Me that they were no allowed to give me a large cup of water....  Really?!  I am paying for the cup?  Since when are you denied a large cup of water?  Awful service!"}
{"text":"This location is so bad that I feel I have to write a review. The service is very slow and the girl who works here is rude. We got here at 6:20 and most of the trays looked like the food has sit there for a long time that they changed color. I asked her if she can make something fresh but she kept telling me is going to take VERY long, and she was not asking the chef to make anything. The worse service I ever had!"}
{"text":"Its three stars, to say its more is a stretch. Its fresher then Manchu Wok.... but its still takeout Chinese."}
{"text":"The food court is clean but too many different smells from other restaurant the food was good the service was friendly however the cashier failed to provide a fortune cookie otherwise it was good"}
{"text":"Slow drive-thru i ended up taking off i waited in the window for more than 3 min with no one there to assist me. Only 2 people inside ordering smh"}
{"text":"Are you serious?  What are you doing?  If you've given up, if you've just said \"$&@! It, let's just get panda\", or you've got a gaggle of screaming kids that won't shut their mouths unless you immediately fill them with orange chicken, then go ahead.  But if you have a choice, and a working brain, go to one of the dozens of local chinese places in the area.  I recommend China Tango."}
{"text":"I keep getting sucked into the \"ease\" of picking up food from here.  The food tastes good, but, too many issues.  From spending 30-40 min in drive thru, being told they are out of xxxx and you can wait 15 min for more (come on, chipotle has the right system, you should learn from them), forgetting to put my egg roll in the bag 3xs now- I know, by the 2nd time I should have started checking the bag... not sure how many more chances I will give this location,  but it's not many..."}
{"text":"The staff here is pretty friendly but way understaffed to keep up with the demand.  This is more if a management issue than a reflection of the employees.  It's be nice to not wait longer than any other Panda Express I go too."}
{"text":"I personally dont like steam table food. But this franchise Chinese restaurant is not bad at all. most of the time, the food is fresh. And their restroom is always clean as well as the dining area. I think they have a pretty good management. My favorite food here is Kungpao Chicken. I like it with their chili sauce."}
{"text":"I actually don't like coming to this panda   the drive thru takes for eveeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!! For eveeeeeerrrrrrrr  And the service overall is something else !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went in today with my girlfriend and a lady started her order them handed it off to another guy. No big deal it's team work. She then takes a order via her head set. The guy finish my girlfriend s order and started doing something else. The first girl comes back and proceeds to skip me and move on to the next person.  Leaving me standing there with an empty tray.   So I went somewhere else to eat.   I have visited this location many times and the service is hit or miss thus the 3 stars. I have even had one of the girls completely ignore me and another guest while she flirted with the cook."}
{"text":"Food is always limited not like it use to be. One day my mother and i went in and lady who served us was pretending not to understand what my mom was saying because she cant speak very well. So very rude and if i can say a little racist."}
{"text":"Showed up around dinner time with three hungry kids and \"hangry\" pregnant wife. Yes, she was more than just hungry, she was \"hangry\". After waiting in line for twenty minutes and getting my food they informed us that they were out of fried rice. So while my already old food mushifies in it's own steam trapped in a styrofoam container I decided to write a review to express my disappointment.  To make things worse their ice machine is broken. Nothing like cold mushy food washed down with a warm drink. I guess on the bright side, and the reason for the one star, the fried rice is fresh!"}
{"text":"I went there about an hour ago and i was happy with my results. I got amazing costumer service and the workers are very nice. The food is delicious and I'm actually eating some right now...yummy!"}
{"text":"me and my family were on our way home and we dropped by for some food and then i was eating it and found a black hair on my shrimp and i have blonde hair please fix this problem immediately we love your food but we would like it without the hair"}
{"text":"Well my wife just picked up some dinner for us since she was running late from work. Unfortunately it just went in the trash. This was the worst food I have had In my mouth in years. I have been eating Panda for many years and have never had any thing like this before. It is terrible.  I am a fan of Panda but will never eat at this one again.  This is my second bad experience at this location."}
{"text":"Pretty crappy service to be honest but what can you expect from the employees working there although the food was good , but the cashier sucked"}
{"text":"It was the worst trip  they messed up my order charged me double lady was rude at the register..It cost me 60.00$ for 4 plates.I won't go back to that location.."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get Chinese style food. The portions aren't as large as other more authentic Chinese style restaurants but the food is always good. Love the honey walnut shrimp, black pepper chicken, orange chicken! But everything is always good. The chow mein is always the side i choose instead of fried rice. Only wish there was more chow mein noodles and less cabbage and onions."}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh as always. The workers are friendly and prompt. They have good service too. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I stopped at this location today for lunch at 11:30 a.m. it is now 6:55 p.m. I am still physically sick from the small amount of food that I ate do not ever go to this location I have never written a negative review in my life that's how bad this experience was"}
{"text":"Rose is the nicest lady ever(cashier). The rest of the staff totally ignores her and have loud personal conversations. They took 10 minutes to bring my child's cream cheese rangoons. They were frozen in the middle. They finally came out around the time we were ready to leave. Panda should fire the entire staff besides Rose and start over with this location. I will never eat here again. Overpriced small portions and fully staffed with cocky high school kids. No thanks"}
{"text":"I love panda express, but quite frankly the last few times that i've eaten at this one in the Venetian I've gotten sick! i thought the first 4 times was just a mere coinsidence but then the 5th and 6th?? i'm fine eating at every other panda express but not this one. And I always get the same thing! I'm guessing it may not be the most sanitary panda express! Idk, all i know is i can't eat at this one anymore bc it literally makes me sick! which sucks! its so convenient bc I work in the Palazzo! Waaaa!"}
{"text":"Go there at least 3 times a week and never had a bad experience until today. First of all no brown rice, not even steamed or fried. 2 female workers very rude! Been in the hospitality Industry since 08, please coach them."}
{"text":"TRASH!! Employees rude and I have stomach flu and that was the last thing I ate b4 I got sick. PLEASE DONT EAT HERE! Or pick a different location."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!! My girlfriend and I went here for a quick dinner. They have slow service and all the food looked like it was sitting out awhile. We both got different chicken meals and she got the noodles and I got the rice. We both were suffering from stomach pains for a couple hours and then we were both vomiting through out the night. Neither one of us could sleep either. I'm surprised a place that just opened isn't more concern about the food they are serving. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"The food of this location not that great than the other one, I was order Kung pao chicken was not that great I'm not happy the way they cut the chicken was to big, n the teriyaki chicken was smell I don't touch it at all, the food here was totally different than the other one, I'm very rarely comment bout food but this one I really not happy with, well I don't think I'm gonna be back for this location it's terrible"}
{"text":"Awful place , worst panda I have been to in the valley. There's another one of camelback that I will drive to from now on to avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I have yet to come to this restaurant and not have the food fresh and hot! The place is always clean and friendly employees! One of the better fast foods in Buckeye!"}
{"text":"Drive thru takes a century when it's open. They're so short staffed though, that you're lucky if it is. Prepare to go inside and stand in line for 20 minutes. Complete joke."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Food was delicous, and the entire staff was friendly. Great dining environment and very clean."}
{"text":"Super nice girl working the counter (jasmine)! The past 2 times I was at Panda Express they were soooo rude because I'm a vegetarian. But she offered to make me fresh tofu eggplant because I said the one on the buffet looked sketchy!!!! Food also not bad."}
{"text":"I am shocked by all of the low ratings for this location.  I've been to several Panda Express locations around the state and this is the best one.  Food tastes great and the staff can hustle.  It's always very busy, but they handle it well and can get through the line quickly."}
{"text":"I ordered online and picked it up in the drive through. It was family-sized order (around $40), and they got everything right, including the extras such as chopsticks and hot mustard.   The drive through took a good ten minutes, which is why I knocked off a star.   Otherwise the service was over the top friendly and the food tasted fresh. I recommend this location and ordering online. Just get off your butt and go in the store if you don't want to bake in your car."}
{"text":"The food was alright, but I can not get over how rude the workers were! One girl rolled her eyes in my face, because I requested the sauce to go with my ragoons. If you don't mind being stared at, like your a complete idiot, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, worst experience of Panda Express, not going back again in this branch , very awful workers and rude"}
{"text":"Horrible location. No lids for bowls to go. Got a small drink & wanted Dr Pepper, it was out. Tried Sierra Mist, it was out. Brought it to their attention & was told they were out of both. Really? I work in fast food, we always have back ups of these kind of things, so all I could think of was either they are all lazy & just wanted everyone to leave so they could close (It was at least 45 minutes before close last Tuesday) or it was true & the manager just sucks at ordering their supplies accordingly. Who knows."}
{"text":"Getti g to this location's parking lot is quite a challenge when driving south on Scottsdale Rd. After several left turns (no U turns are allowed) I pulled in the very small parking lot & try to find a spot. Looks like drive-thru may be a better option if one has to use this location. Upone entering it looks nice, newer looking than most Panda's. Not too many people in there, lunch time & only 2 people in front of me, but workers in front were slow. No greeting, just who's next. I wanted a few entrees but there was so little in their 'holding container', & the sauce looked like it was burnt on the bottom, I didn't want to take a chance. So basically I ordered what was full.  The low-mein was kind of greasy, to the point I felt like I had a film on my teeth when walking out. I won't be back to this location again."}
{"text":"When Panda Express in West Mifflin opened we went to the drive through, however, the line was was so long that we decided to go inside to order.  Once inside,there was yet another very long line and somewhat understandable because they had only been opened for a few weeks.  It took 45 minutes to get our food.  We did get the food to go and I admit the bowls we had were very good and tasty.  Fast forward a few months and tonight we decided to order and pay on-line to expedite our food order and even had time option for pick up.  When we went to the designated time (with our confirmation number of order and payment) they did not have our food ready nor did they have our order.  What was the point of submitting the order on line when  we had to submit our order again and wait for our food.  We gathered our order and brought it home to be again, disappointed in the texture and flavor of the food.  The rice I ordered was extremely dry and hard with no flavor.  The beef and broccoli consisted of 3 or 4 pieces of meat, again with no flavor.  I will admit the broccoli was good.  But that was about it.  I would not recommend this place nor will I go there again.  Paying $15 for 2 meals that was flavorless and uneatable was a waste of my money."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times with my husband and they didnt have what we wanted.  So when they made it they put the wrong items in the wrong plates. Mind you, they wrote it on the outside of it and still got it wrong. So, yes I went back today and they only had the drive thru open and only had four items from the whole menu not cool. So they just have there drive thru open to feed people there leftovers so they wont have wasted food, how sad is that. And im a GM at a restaurant I would never do that. I wont be back anytime so to this location."}
{"text":"This location is the absolute worst they are incredibly slow which is frustrating in the first place but then when they take close to 30 minutes to get you through the drive through they can't even get you the correct order. I ordered 2 plates and got one that was correct the other one had the wrong entrees and then I had asked for soy sauce and an a side of teriyaki sauce but nope they can't even manage to remember two things added on."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Panda Express chain and this location is no exception. It's a short 10-15 minute walk from the Luxor where I was staying. The employee working there was extremely friendly and told me that I could have a sample of any item if I would like. It was a bit later in the evening when I visited so there were only a few other customers around and it was quiet but they did have TVs available if you wanted to watch something while you ate."}
{"text":"Very BAD service!!! The customer service need improvement and I see why the clerks are the way they are is because the Manager has very bad attitude. I'll NEVER spend my money at this location again!! NO STAR!!"}
{"text":"I love panda express especially this one the girls are always nice and polite. The only complaint I would have is they always run out of teriyaki chicken :/  Still love this place tho! The food has always been good and the seating and tables have always been clean. Would definitely recommend this location if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and poor food quality. Although we did get fresh walnut shrimp but only after the cook had an attitude and bumpin gums under his breath.. maybe if they stay doing his job keeping fresh food on display he wouldnt have time for all the tude. I manage fast food restaurant and that work staff would be unacceptable, i would be embarrassed.  Will never go back as i would not recommend it."}
{"text":"During the lunch rush the line almost makes its way out the door sometimes, so employees are motivated to get you through quickly.  The food here is typical, bland, and uninspired, which is sometimes good when you just don't want any surprises.  Don't expect to get anything too pungent or too spicy here.  Because the food is kept in warming trays, it usually has a \"dried out\" taste to it if you don't get it fresh during the lunch rush (and even then, it's not a given).    If you find yourself starving near College and University and can't decide on what to eat, eat at Panda."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and tidy. Employees are nice. The cooking needs some work. It's good but not the best."}
{"text":"This is my favorite for Oriental take-out. Their food is always fresh and tasty, service is quick and the staff is always pleasant. Plus it's convenient. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Worst panda express on the face of this earth. Food is never fresh. They need a new cook because nothing is ever right. The orange chicken is funny tasting. The employees are always unattentive and rude. they act like you are bothering them. I've work across the parking lot from this place from 4 years and its been the same story! Tables and floors are usually filthy. It makes me doubt the cleanliness of the kitchen.... AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!"}
{"text":"It seems everyone is going with the up-pricing and down-sizing.  We used to be able to get two meals from a 2 item entree.  They've had incredible shrinking portions for some time now.  The servers even admitted the serving size is now only \"one scoop\".  I also noticed the containers they serve in are smaller than before.  I guess to trick us into thinking we're getting the same amount.  \"Oh wow!  I must have been super hungry to eat all that food when it's usually enough for two meals.\"  Seriously, this isn't one of my favorite places anyway.  I prefer authentic, freshly made food."}
{"text":"Its like all panda express locations. Went after lunch and they had no fresh food. When we ordered they wrote down what my husband and I wanted and brought out fresh food. It was amazing. Kinda hidden behind some trees/bushes. If I'm on that side of town I'll dine in again. Employees were friendly and knew what they were doing. The service was quick."}
{"text":"We came in to the restaurant at 9:30 pm on the door it says they close at 10:30 bit most of the dining room was blocked off. There was plenty of employees standing around but the line was taking forever. Most of the food was gone so when the guy behind me ordered Kong pow chicken the cook literally rolled his eyes!! These people still had an hour to go but were acting like their shift was over."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Very slow. Always out of food. Even tried ordering online 40 mins in advance, when I arrived at the store, food still wasn't ready and was told it would be another 20 mins when the food should have been ready for pick up 25 mins after ordering. Asked for a refund and still took 5 mins to credit the credit card, which I never did receive."}
{"text":"I would only eat Panda, if it were the last CHinese Food on Earth.  Everything has an aftertaste to me, and their are maybe 5 items at best to choose from.   Teeny boppers seem to love it though,  as there always seems to be a long line of them, whenever I pass by."}
{"text":"I got cheese rangoons and they didn't include sweet & sour sauce with my to-go order.  I called the store when I got home and their response is: \"eh, I think you gotta ask for it.  Did you ask for it?\"     Just don't go to THIS location."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this establishment is the worst Panda I have been to. They had only one server/cashier at 6pm for the dinner rush. On top of that, the guy barely spoke English and had several issues when ordering. :( sad."}
{"text":"Worst experience at any panda eveeeeeer! I wonder if the staff gets trained at all,!?! they don't have a clue of what is customer service!  My boyfriend and I went for take out last night, the girl  was so unprofessional and rude! She wasn't paying attention to us at all since she and  the other girls were talking and joking around in between each other through their head piece. .how unprofessional and rude!!!  The food was very old and bland! Aren't they supposed to be rotating food if it's seating there for a period of time?  What a shame...."}
{"text":"Inedible.  I had the Bejing Beef and Kung Pao Chicken.  Mrs WhoDo had the Orange Chicken. Neither of us could eat our entrees.  We threw this food away.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here cause my daughter loves Panda Express's noodles and teriyaki chicken. We were greeted when we came in and the lady asked if we would like to sample anything which was nice. I ordered her food but they forgot to give me teriyaki sauce for her teriyaki chicken so I had to ask for it and then ice machine was not producing ice so I let one of the ladies know and she said there is nothing that they could do about the machine."}
{"text":"This location lacks customer service and every time I want to give them another chance, it's disappointing. The food quality is poor and the few times I do go in, most dishes are out. What little food is left looks like it's been sitting around for hours. This fast food is not fast."}
{"text":"This location is quick for lunch, usually in and out fairly quickly. Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean. A bit overprized, likely the Town Square location.."}
{"text":"3 stars because I just love Panda, but this location is way too slow. Every time I come here there is always 2 people working the whole area and the line is so long we have to stand by people while they eat.  I live in walking distance from here and when I see more than 5 people in line I pass because it could take over half an hour to get to the register. I've passed on eating here over a dozen times."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. I went there right after closing time and the manager still let me in and offered a discount for the left over food. She is friendly and so are the rest of the staff. The food is always fresh."}
{"text":"My Troubled Relationship with Panda Express  A few years ago, I visited my friend Kristin in Seattle. By some miracle the day was beautiful: the sun was out, and the temperature was just over 70. I was already making plans to move there and live as a street performer.  But on the flight back, my rowmate quickly brought me down to Earth.  \"Living in Seattle, is like being married to a beautiful woman,\" he said.   \"...who is a wonderful cook... but is always sick.\" Bummer. I stayed in Az.  A few days ago I realized the drive-thru Panda Express behind my house is like a beautiful woman... who is a wonderful cook... but is also prone to domestic violence and destined to give me diabetes: the one on cops who gets arrested for hitting her boyfriend with a skillet, and setting their trailer on fire.  What kind of abuse? Well, the most recent was randomly waiting in the drive-thru for 20 minutes behind an exhaust belching Ford Expedition filled with screaming 5 year olds running around the back seat.  Because you can hear the person ahead of you order, I knew exactly what I was getting into when I heard \"Are you sure you want Beijing beef? That one might take awhile\" and after a chorus of shrill screams of \"NOOooooooooooooo! BEIJNG BEEF! BEIJING BEEF!\" the mother said, \"yes we'll wait.\"    But still, I kept going. I wanted Panda. It was not open for debate. I ordered my typical 3 entree plate with fried rice, 1 orange chicken, 1 kung pow chicken, 1 mandarin chicken. This is very important because I've calculated that it is the order with the highest meat per vegetable ratio.   Why is that important? Because vegetables are gross, that's why.  So, as I'm sitting there with my car turned off like a rational person... inhaling fumes from the expedition that has been idiling for 10 minutes, I think to myself, \"John... you're stupid. You are an idiot. You could have had your pick of the fast food places here! There's Arbys, McDonalds, Subway-- even a Chick-fil-et! Heck, you could have even baked a chicken breast at home by now. Why on earth would you subject yourself to this?! It's ridiculous! The only thing that could make this better is to go home and write a scathing review on Yelp. And then your three yelp friends will read it. And then Panda Express will rue the day they ran out of Beijing Beef! They'll rue the Hell out of it!\"  But as I pulled forward and the dreamy drive-thru girl handed me the plastic bag full of sweet saturated fat and hydrogenated oily goodness... well the heat of the leaking cardboard containers must have melted my heart. And after eating the whoooooole thing, I found myself forgetting the 20 minutes of annoyance... and just remembering the good times... specifically, the 10 minutes of stuffing my face.   4 stars, because I should know better... but I keep going back anyway."}
{"text":"A Very good Panda Express !!  I love the Orange chicken  alway fresh just like all the others !!   Really good customer server taking care of customers and showing them new items   Very clean Resturant and love those panda picture  just right when you walk in the place it feels peaceful and calm"}
{"text":"Manager Alan & staff (Devonne, Brendin, Nadya, Oscar & Carlos) are fun & So nice!!! We lived out  of the country for the last 4yrs & came back for the eggplant/tofu-- ok, our fav was Sold Out, BUT the customer service made up for our disappointment, Lol. We went with the yummy orange chicken, chow mein, beef/broccoli & chicken/beans. Was Ono! (Delicious! Hawaiians know where Da'Grinds stay!)  Go check 'em out!"}
{"text":"Do not come to this Panda Express. You walk in and food is not ready and they aren't even cooking it. As soon as a restaurant opens it's expected for all the food to be ready as well. They didn't even have sauce like wow is it really that hard to heat up some sauce. I won't be coming back , the food was terrible and looked and tasted old."}
{"text":"Linda has a nasty ass attitude . worst service ever. asked me if i wanted a sample & i said yes & then she refused to give it to me. she was so rude , i won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I would like to review the food, but unfortunately they didnt have any! We live down the street from here and thought we would try it out since we have eaten here at the malls. It was 9pm and there were 6 empty bowls and a spoonful of food in the others to chose from. There were about 6 employees that appeared to be doing something, but im not sure what since they didnt have any food to offer. Since I dont PAY MONEY for leftovers, we left and ordered food from Golden LIlly Chinese. Im pretty sure if you want to succeed as a business you have to have something to sell. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT"}
{"text":"Not surprised on the reviews, all of my family and friends refuse to come here. The food is great, when they don't run out of it. But the customer service is unbelievable. I've never been treated with such attitude, when they run out of food it's because \"the dinner rush\" you'd think they'd know how prepared to be by then? Stop just reading the bad reviews on the employees, get new ones."}
{"text":"Food is great just need to hired more people just the line is always long and there so slow"}
{"text":"Always an EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE here at Panda Express! The Manager ABBI works right along with the crew, she is awesome as is her friendly and fast workers. It amazes me how FAST the food is ready. It has always been HOT, FRESH and served with a smile! Another thing we are always very pleased with, is how the open kitchen, restaurant and even the rest rooms are always Extremely CLEAN!!!  This restaurant deserves FIVE STARS all the way!  Also, dont worry if it looks really busy, they really are super fast and will have you on your way with the BEST CHINESE FOOD  we have found in the valley!!!  Thank you ABBI and staff for making every visit INCREDIBLE! Frank & Doug"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Panda Express my Family and I ever ate at. The orange chicken was mushy and the honey walnut shrimp tasted like it was dipped in bad batter or something. Very inconsistent with other  Panda Express Restaurants we've had up here so far.   Costumer service is bad as well. If I could give this a total of 0 stars, I totally would. The biggest let down was, we came here using a promo code for BOGO and before picking up our plates, we noticed an error, so we called. The guy who answered said he would change the order, but in exchange he charged my daughter for the second plate. So, no damn BOGO! My advice to anyone wanting to eat at this Panda Express, don't! To top it off, my daughter felt a bit sick after eating their food. We ordered a total of 4 plates. What a waste of a damn good promo code too. Even the Shanghai Beef was not up to par. Two thumbs down. I hope their managers see this and correct any customer service problems and let their cook know, they SUCK!!!!"}
{"text":"First off food was good, not bad, not great, the reason for 2stars , well the place was very dirty, floor, soda area, and at 1:00PM on a wed, we only found 1table clean.  This is not cool.  We haven't been for awhile because of this reason the last time we came, we see I guess, they just don't care.  Sad."}
{"text":"As far as fast but fresh food for dinner goes, panda is fed up there. This is my favorite location though. Great customer service and though my entree ran out and had to be re-stocked I was offered an egg roll while I wait for my entree to be prepped! 5th star redeemed!"}
{"text":"3 times in a row without fortune cookies and the wrong noodles, made a complaint online and provided my receipt number and details and received back information that you guys were going to make it right and send coupons. Well.... ya never made it right so here I am making it right for you. The workers there are clueless and run around the store like chickens with their heads cut off, great job guys"}
{"text":"Why does the panda express in the mall suck so bad when it's so good at freestanding shops? Is it lazy workers? Food been sitting too long? What is it? It's like obviously i got the orange chicken. Duh. But when i get it at the mall it's all soggy like they just microwaved it. But when i get it at a freestanding store- it's crispylicious! What the wok, panda?"}
{"text":"Place is terrible. Portion are super small and food isn't that good. Taste like microwave Chinese food. Too over priced for serving size. Poor quality. I'd stick with a local Chinese place such as silk road."}
{"text":"Won't return to this location. Cashier seemed  very agitated. Chow Main was not cooked. Tables and floor dirty."}
{"text":"I went here today; first time at this particular location. I've been to other Panda Expresses (mainly in the East Valley) and I love the food they offer. I'm now on this side of town, so I decided to give this location a try.   The restaurant itself is clean and picked up. I brought my phone charger, charger plug, and my phone with me in hopes that they had an outlet near a booth to charge up my phone. There is only one outlet in the lobby and that outlet is nowhere near a booth or table. - 1/2 star for that.   The customer service was superb; however, you have to ask for chopsticks because they aren't displayed at the fountain station (other Panda Expresses do have them displayed at their fountain station). - 1/2 star for that.   All Pandas have their chopsticks made of imitation bamboo, but this particular Panda Express has chopsticks made of balsa wood. When you break them apart, they don't snap on the stress mark down the middle. Towards the end of the pair, they break off center and you can see tiny little splinters on the edges of chopsticks. -¼ star for that.   The food quality was great, just like any other Panda. I had the Mushroom Chicken with Steamed Brown Rice.   While I was there, a little girl had tinkled herself and had dripped on the floor. The staff reacted quickly to put a barricade up, but didn't put the barricade up right over where she had diddled. Customers could still have stepped in it. -¾ stars for that.   Would I come back to this location? Probably not.   Finally score total: 3 stars"}
{"text":"Cold rice not sure if this was chicken bought from the drive thru. Drove by on opening day and saw people waiting in line. Thought I should try it. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Great value, tasty food, friendly service, clean!  Consider the kids meal for a tasty snack in between adventures :)"}
{"text":"Please read all reviews on this particular franchise. As you will see on the ratings, this store has the worst scores for all area Panda Express'.   The corporate office should really take a look at this site. I have been here with my family a few times, and nothing ever changes. The service, the food, and the cleanliness of the inside is terrible.  Today, when we entered, everyone was in the back, and didn't acknowledge us for at least 3 minutes. Finally a short heavy girl came out, and asked what we wanted. She started serving our order on plates to eat in, when my wife said it was to go, she shouted, \"you told me it was for here\", and threw the food back into the heating tray. We had to order what they had, which was very limited, and she said it would take \"awhile\" before any other food would be ready.  The teriyaki chicken looked dried out, and tasted that way too. The guy that rang us up was very unfriendly and rude. We even saw some bugs near the register, which made sense, because the floors were filthy.  You have many Pandas to choose from. If you want a good meal in a friendly clean environment, then do not come to this particular franchise.  In my opinion, this store should be closed down."}
{"text":"I ordered the orange chicken with fried rice & it was good, but they got my order wrong. They gave me white rice instead of fried rice, but i understand that people make mistakes & maybe she didn't hear me correctly thru the drive thru. I would have went back to correct the order but I already drove back to work. Anyways, it was all tasty & the portions were great. The girl at the window was also pleasant, so overall a descent experience."}
{"text":"First of all it's not even called panda express. It's called Pan Asian express. second of all I personally didn't like the food. Everything served cold and I thought you can't go wrong with fried rice and orange chicken. The worst I've ever had. I think subway would have been better. Eat fresh!"}
{"text":"Yea, it's not the absolute best Chinese food. But I really like some of the options there. The honey sesame chicken and the honey walnut shrimp are my two favorites! Sometimes you just want some good ole Panda!   Other the past few years this chain has definitely stepped it up!"}
{"text":"Everything is greasy and not very fresh. I tried the \"famous\" orange chicken and cannot understand why this is so popular: it seems to have been soaked in vinegar for far too long. The chow mein has hardly anything in it but noodles, and it is so greasy, it's not worth the bother."}
{"text":"Worst CUSTOMER service ever!! If I could give negative stars I would! My family and I hardly eat out so I was craving Panda Express and was so happy that they opened up closer to my home. I picked up kids from school and headed to the drive thru. The lady taking our order was in a rush apparently. After the first order she asked if that was it and I stated no.I stated my second order and again she asked is that it. Then for my son's meal they didn't have Gatorade (yeah right) but they have Mountain Dew (which tasted nothing like MD) I believe they gave him Sprite instead. Then the screen that showed our order disappeared. I stated I'm not done (had to state this several times) and proceeded to take my order but I still couldn't verify if my order was correct or not. I pay and  our food is ready but I don't get mine. Again with the excuses ( you took my order but can't even tell me how much food I ordered and plus it's on my reciept) I wait a lot longer to get my food because the rice wasn't ready. Didn't see the girls name but if she was my employee she would be FIRED!! Plus she never gave me napkins,fork, or fortune cookie. It's not about these small things because I was going home just wanted to give everyone a heads up.One more thing my Terkaki Chicken was in big chunks and NO Terkaki sauce WTH!! and what a surprise none in the bag either. NEVER coming back here again!!!!"}
{"text":"What has happened? Hopefully not all Panda expresses have reduced their packaging and portion sizes. This store has though. The rice was also pasty and overcooked. I was very disappointed. You guessed it, the prices have not changed either for the better. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I work close by to this panda express it's a accessible on their quick with their service at the drive-in I love the drive-in in fact on makes it so I can get back to work on time the food is excellent bus services fast thank you"}
{"text":"This location is like a lot of other locations. Seems to be going downhill. Never have general tso chicken. When you order online they don't prepare your order until you show up to pick up your order. Just like the location on northern. Then act as though the order just came in. I gave one star because these things are really annoying. Get it together Panda Express."}
{"text":"I want so badly to like this place but the service is horribly slow every time we visited and the food was subpar. On our last visit, we did take out and after our 30 minute wait we got home and my shrimp was still cold. Not to mention the floor was extremely sticky that my shoes made an audible sucking sounds when I walked. I cannot see myself ever coming back."}
{"text":"I'm not happy. I got sick off of food from here last night. I think they really need to check to see if the food is fresh before giving it to a customer."}
{"text":"One word...\"FAIL\"  Figured I check out this new spot that opened up for a quick lunch. I walk in and half of the dishes aren't even available and this is just before noon so don't you think you should stock up for the lunch rush? The lady helping mentioned she could take my order I pay and they will bring it out to me...sure why not??!!!   20 minutes later after watching everyone come after me get their food someone finally makes eye contact with me and asks what I was waiting for...turns out they gave my order to someone else. The lady goes to that table apologizes and bring them their correct order while I'm still standing there without an explanation of where my lunch is. Then they push a plate to me and apologized for the long wait, i look at it and tell them that's not my order. So after a 30 minute ordeal of waiting around I just asked for a refund and when the Manager comes over to process doesn't even care to ask why or what is wrong or insist how he can correct the situation. Yah...\"FAIL\""}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. They are always so rude. I work across the street so my co workers and i eat there alot. But im thinking i better stop going in there because if one more snotty girl acts like its a bother to give me soy sauce or add a drink to my order i might react negatively. Hire new employees."}
{"text":"We were greeted the moment we walked in the door. We were given samples to try. The server (Scottie C) was smiling & pleasant the entire time taking care of us. This was a breath of fresh air - it was a delightful visit!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Just terrible i went to that panda and 2 hours later i was sutting over my toliet vomiting. You gus seriously need to get in check because if you keep making peiple sick you will get in trouble for it. And the service was terrible. I've mever heard an employee be that rude to a customer.  If people decide to go to this location good luck. You are in for a terrible suprise.   I wish i could give 0 stars"}
{"text":"Words cant describe that panda express. The customer service was mediocre. When we went up to order i asked fir orange chicken and white rice. A lack of white rice is bad. Their lack of supplies and OK service made this a bad decision to go to. I would not recommend this panda express to anyone unless they enjoy terrible food"}
{"text":"Panda Express is Panda Express. It's not gourmet or even great. It's good. This food is reliable and quick and you know it will be enjoyable. Also this location is staffed with professionals who know what they are doing. For that they squeak out a 4th star."}
{"text":"Food is what it is. Service however was great. Had a laundry list order and they got me in and out in a matter of minutes. Everything correct with the special orders and friendly as well. I've picked up food for this group before and most people look at the order and frown. These guys said no problem."}
{"text":"There was hair in my fried rice.  When I spoke to the cashier she offered to replace the meal. I declined the offer for the additional food as I had lost my appetite and I did not want anymore potentially contaminated food. I requested a meal voucher but I had thrown my receipt away.  Lucky for them as I no longer have the survey code, and they did not offer me a voucher."}
{"text":"Your standard Panda Express but a great value for eating at on the strip while at the Miracle Mile Shops. I recommend getting the kids meal if you're just looking for a quick bite to eat. Comes with a starch, a side, a drink, and a cookie for about $5. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Okay so I've been to a lot of Panda Expresses in my life and this one is my favorite. Love the drive thru because it's always fast and the food is surprisingly fresh every time i get it. I actually live closer to two other panda's but none compare to this location so I drive out to this one. Their customer service is always great and they are always super kind to me."}
{"text":"Just bought a panda bowl here and the brown rice they gave me was spoiled.. Disgusting.."}
{"text":"Fresh food, good variety,  friendly staff go here regularly my son loves the cookies and most times they give free samples as well as free drinks"}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express I've been too. I have done online ordering multiple times and they took more then forty minutes to fill my order. Sometimes they don't even acknowledge you when you go in. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Haven't been back to this location for a while should have never gone back seems like if I ask for them to make something fresh I am putting them out. Food on the line is always gross and seems like it has been out too long when the cook fresh they rush it and serve the meat raw"}
{"text":"Horrible! Ordered drive thru at 7:48, paid at 8:06, received change at 8:10, waited for food until 8:18. Finally pulled away from window. Ran in and asked what the hell is going on. They all said no food was ready. Meanwhile I'm watching thru window and there's no one in line and there's food in pans. A worker replied \"we had to wait for your food cause it want ready\". Straight out lied! I demanded my refund. JP the manager said no problem. I asked why it took so long since there was barely any customers in restaurant. His response was \"here's your change and have a nice night.\" I replied thanks for listening or should I say thanks for tuning me out. I'll be calling and speaking with your DM. He said bye. So I called and spoke to the young lady at the location and asked for managers name then DM's name and told her that the Custer service there sucks a$$! Done with the barely speaking any English, slower than ever, lying workers! Trust- I will be calling corporate."}
{"text":"The gal that worked in drive thru last night was very nice and friendly. She greeted me and she also asked me if I would like soy sauce or chili. Usually, the other gals that worked there only took my card and turned off the window. She was the best!!!! I did not recall her name but she was Asian (I think)."}
{"text":"Would suggest management get better quality pandas- The teriyaki is really chewy, but the orange is pretty good; a very sweet/spicy combination. Was very gamey as far as panda goes. Likely farmed and flash frozen, not fresh. Had a little bit of blowdart aftertaste, as well. Two stars."}
{"text":"Great food! Will definitely going back to this store the associates are always friendly ;-)"}
{"text":"A great place for quick Canadian Chinese food if you're in the neighbourhood. The prices are slightly higher than most Chinese restaurants but the food is significantly better. There are lots of great options and staff are happy to let you try a sample. If something is wrong, they will happily replace your order. Worth a visit if you're in the area looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Another good meal at Panda Express.  The foods always fresh and this particular location is never very crowded.  Now, if we could find similar food at a similar price but served on real plates with real silverware, that would be great.  But, for a decent different-from-the-usual lunch, this place is great."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so you probably know what to expect with the food...delicious! If you are unfamiliar with Panda, they offer great chinese food at the ready at good prices. Definitely grab chow mein and orange chicken, then throw in any of the other entrées (kung pow being my go to). Also the spring rolls are great and be sure to experiment with sauces.  This particular one, however, lacks in service. There's usually a long line that is poorly attended upon. Often times I've had to wait while they cook up refills. I've also seen them have only one person on for dishing out food and running the cash register.   Besides the service being slow, the place is clean and has good seating. Perfect place to grab a quick meal or to cure that chinese hankering! Good lunch for with friends or solo study time."}
{"text":"Workers walking around talking and laughing when the line is out the door. Horribly slow service"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 entree meal. Orange chicken, teriyaki chicken and chow mien. Got home and what I actually got was teriyaki chicken, broccoli, half fried rice and chow mien. I thought it was a simple enough order and it was still messed up. Not sure if I should of expected better than what I got. No wonder they get minimum wage."}
{"text":"I came in and ordered food to go, and I was disappointed when I found out they gave me the wrong plate. I called in to ask for a refund and they refused. Im never going back there again."}
{"text":"Never the best ..... Never the worst. This location is A-OK. The food has always been decent. The staff has always been courteous."}
{"text":"Just confirmed at a different panda ordering the same thing that I was way overcharged yesterday, why put in a plate when I ordered a small a la carte?? The price difference is to big to ignore double check your orders here!!"}
{"text":"The worst Panda I have ever been to, maybe the worst establishment I have ever been to. Service is awful and extremely slow. If you're in a hurry don't even bother walking in the doors. If you are lucky they might get your order right and be careful as the employees love to change you for extras like egg rolls, spring rolls but not actually give them to you. If you do go here look closely at you receipt. The staff basically stands around doing  nothing and don't expect anything from management as they don't care."}
{"text":"Great service all around if you need some new and hot they are right on it. Love going to panda most days craving it. Like the fact they change things up here and there see what works. Doing good job and continue to do great"}
{"text":"this location always has a line but it moves so fast !!  the food is ALWAYS  OMG fresh  and delicious always SMOKING hot and smells like heaven!   they have awesome specials and tons of emploies so they never run out of anything!  I love panda and this is my new fav location!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here the first time today. I ordered chow mien noodles with orange chicken. It is at best a 5/10 meal. The cost to quantity ratio sucks to be honest. My friend ordered 3 things. He said the rice is good. Shanghai beef was good. The atmosphere is nice and clean. You can try samples of stuff which is nice. The best part about this place was the sobey energize green tea. Tasted like heaven to wash down the taste of the wannabe Asian food. The fortune cookies taste awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch drive thru. Order was taken well and greeted by friendly Tisha I think was her name. Food was quick and fresh and really good. Had the beijing beef bowl. Panda is in the South Premium Outlets center. I have tried other Pandas because I love this particular bowl.  Will definitely be back when I need a fix."}
{"text":"So excited to have Asian style mall food back in Parma!  I eagerly await it's opening.  I went on a Sunday night and was shocked!  This place is nice on the outside but it is a DUMP on the inside.  20 employees were just standing around.  No one said hello to me.  And the food?   There greeted me 20 scraped empty trays left in the display and a dry Lo Main  and a nasty looking orange chicken.  I left I was disgusted  No way for me!"}
{"text":"okay, this is the second time I tried to eat here in the last 40 days and had to leave due to they have no fresh food  ready. I order the same thing every time in go to panda, I order a bowl with half rice half steamed veg  and teriyaki chicken.   Rice...yep have it, steamed vegi... old and nasty! she didn't even try to serve it to me good job! but it will take 10 min to make more!!! okay what ever, so i wait 10 min...  still no vegi so i ask how long now... Im told the cook is really busy as thy are out of every thing  but he can only make one thing at a time. yep one cook! I look and yep also out of teriyaki chicken so i went next door and had sushi AGAIN"}
{"text":"Tried the orange chicken but it needed more sauce. The rice was very dry. Not impressed with the food"}
{"text":"I feel like PX (can we please make \"PX\" cool?) gets a bad rap because it's \"not authentic,\" but the only thing authentic about it is that authentic Chinese people never eat it. I'm sure I am not alone when I admit I have no idea who the hell General Tso is and isn't \"sweetfire\" really more like an oxymoron?   My work recently had a quarterly luncheon catered by PX (really trying to make this happen here) and everything about the process was a breeze - we were able to order ahead of time, designate a point of contact at the location, show up, pick up, and head back to the office in the nick of time. The girl working the cash register was like a one-woman show, manning orders for here whilst coordinating orders to go, but still had us leaving with ours in tact. Except no chopsticks - this left a lot of my Caucasian coworkers severely more disgruntled than I expected.   Just to be clear, oversaucing anything deep fried is not the formula for authentic Chinese food, but my team seemed to enjoy it and let's face it, Americanized Chinese food is like any other junk or fast food! It's quick, easy, and lasts a moment on your lips and forever on your hips. Xie xie."}
{"text":"They messed up my order and told me they will give me a free 2 entree and one side. They lied. I went in today and they told me no. Don't go to the panda at this location unless you want to pay for a 3 entree and only get 2."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panda Express. It's my go to restaurant in the area. The employees are always happy and greet me once I walk in the door. Occasionally I come in about 15-30 minutes before closing (I know, I hate being THAT customer, but I don't live that close) and they are happy to make the food I want, even if that means they have to cook a new batch. The cashiers even offer me water while I wait. I don't think I get service like this anywhere else. Besides the service, the food is pretty awesome. My favorite thing to get is the Sriracha shrimp and honey walnut shrimp. AMA-ZING."}
{"text":"I've had problems in the past with this Panda.   Today's visit I was pleasantly surprised and it was the complete opposite of past visits. The store was busy but we didn't wait more than 3 minutes to be served. All the food was fresh and stocked. There was enough employees in all areas and all were working. The portions were fair. Very happy with the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"They just opened at 10am and I went there at 1040am to beat the 11am to Noon lunch crowd. Wanted brown rice with my order, but they did not have any. But the girl did not say when they would have any so that I might wait. She asked if I wanted white rice or noodles. I repeated that I wanted brown rice. So she checked with the cook, who you can see in plain sight, she came back and said there was no brown rice. So that's it? Not very friendly or apologetic. I just said \"no thanks\" and left. I've had similar experiences at this location. Their front line help and cooks need more training. Ended up going to another Asian restaurant that had brown rice readily available and great service along with it."}
{"text":"Has been open for over an hour and over half the food still not made.  So I had to get something I didn't come in for..  what I got was good but with the said there was no food even being cooked and the chefs were standing by the tables eating..   I suggest if you open at 9:30 you should be in early to get the food cooked.. kinda bummed about my lunch today."}
{"text":"This Panda is pretty good fast casual. The food's been great every time I've stopped in, and while it's nothing to really impress, it's great if you want to get something quickly."}
{"text":"It is official Panda Express has joined the ranks with the rest of North Vegas in making its food as disgusting as it can be my dog will not eat their food who said pets are dumb.. I hate Vegas"}
{"text":"Food is good enough. Just be sure to get there early enough to get what you want. Also the online system is lacking, & I would not suggest it. Never once been ready at \"pickup\" time."}
{"text":"Hey everybody, sorry it's taken me so long to review this Panda Express but what can I say - I've been busy lately. If you're not familiar with Panda Express then let me give you the low-down and fill you in on the scoop:  Panda Express is a chain and I personally know that they have locations from Philly to Phoenix because I have been to them first hand and definitely know what I am talking about, but this review is for one SPECIFIC location so listen up. This place has Chinese food, and basically everyone who works there is Chinese I think, so by definition that's pretty authentic. The food quality here has a pretty big range, depending on when you show up. If it's a busy time and lots of people are ordering then it's pretty fresh and delicious, and there's a lot to choose from. If you come at an off-time, then expect that the food has been sitting under their little heat lamp glass armor fort thing for a while, and might not be up to your high standards, but if that's the case I guess you're the one who screwed up because I already warned you about that in my review, you big dungus!  The atmosphere here is actually pretty nice for a fast food joint. It's on the corner of a shopping center and there's lots of windows and good seating so if you're going to hang out, you can just look out the window at the people walking by, and there's a McDonalds just outside and you can make faces at the people in the drive thru.  As for the service, it's pretty average. The people are nice, and they let you sample things if you want, but nobody's ever been particularly excited to serve me Chinese food there, which I guess makes sense because I wouldn't be excited to do that either."}
{"text":"There's nothing worse than going through drive thru, getting home to eat and BAM half of your order is missing, Yes literally half the food you ordered isn't there?!? .. Seriously Wtf?!?... Come on man this shit always happens!"}
{"text":"I've give her if I had the option the people who work here are beyond rude and lazy and had all of their product off the line 20 minutes before close and refuse to make anything saying it was too close to closing. I work in the restaurant industry and if we have the unpleasant surprise of somebody walking in even three minutes before close and want to order 5 of the hardest dishes to make off the menu you better believe our cooks as sad and upset to know that they will be there another hour even longer, still make those dishes."}
{"text":"As I'm writing this, i have already been waiting in the drive thru line for 15 minutes and counting with no one checking if I wanted to park and wait (so the people behind me can get their food) or ask if I want something else (in case the hold up was due to food not being stocked). If I had known the wait would be this long, I would have just got to McDonald's"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Minimal wait for service, and efficient serving. Friendly staff. Good food with good portions."}
{"text":"Just ordered a beef broccoli bowl and it wasn't that good. Broccoli was so tough because they didn't blanch them before stir frying and you only about 5 pieces of beef. Fried rice was room temperature."}
{"text":"Got my lunch here (to go), beef brocolli & chicken teriyaki my all-time fave, this time it is so tender and perfect for my sensitive teeth, satisfied with the food but not really with the cashier who was nice at first but after I said \"next time\" on her offer to donate on a charity they've chosen, she started frowning and didn't smile at all (not knowing I'm donating regulary every quarter for the charity directly)ofcourse I won't say that.Just paid my order and went home to eat."}
{"text":"Still waiting over 10 minutes past when the order is supposed to be ready. Not impressed and not sure this is worth it"}
{"text":"I go to this location multiple times a month and spend $50+ every time I go.... and today the kid that was preparing my plates hardly put any chow mien in my sons kids plate and when I asked him to put just a little more he told me NO...... and then wanted to argue with me. Really like how much more noodles could he have put in that little plate that was worth arguing with a customer over."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today, just thought I would share some info. The place was very clean, service was good and all the food seem pretty fresh."}
{"text":"I wrote a similar review for Sonic drive-in. I don't eat fast food very often, although probably more than I should, however there are certain fast food places that always disappoint me. Every time I drive by a panda express I think to myself, \"I haven't been there in a while it might be good\", and every time, I leave feeling a little sick to my stomach and a little regretful. I'd much rather go next door to Rubios and get some fish tacos or a burrito."}
{"text":"Cold and tasteless. I ordered the three side hoping for the best but got the worst. Even the spring rolls were well cold and tasteless. The guy next to us was bathing his in siracha  ( smart man)!"}
{"text":"People here were very friendly and when they saw our dog (we went through the drive thru) they got super excited and it was just a super good time"}
{"text":"What's to say... it's Panda Express, with a drive-thru.  Friendly enough service, and usually quick to give you your food. Well, as long as you're not unfortunate enough to be there during dinner prime time and have 5+ cars ahead of you."}
{"text":"This location is sometimes great other times not.   I've had times when I waited a long time for one of the messing items. I was told it would be no more than 5 minutes but I've sat for about 15 minutes waiting while the rest of my order sat in the to go box and got cold.  There have been times where I've had an amazing experience. The staff was fast, communicating, and lastly all the items were fresh and had plenty to go around.  I believe it all depends on the time in which you go. I suggest between lunch and dinner rush. If not prepare to wait!"}
{"text":"Me and my family took dinner yesterday night, today my both girls are sick who day. I advise that the health inspector should be visiting this store every single day. Very BAD experience"}
{"text":"So excited to see Panda Express open up...but very disappointed by the lack of vegetarian offerings.  Not one entree on the menu is plant friendly.  Rice and mixed veggies is an option, as is the veggie spring roll (which they were out of at 1pm today).  However, this is a bit underwhelming."}
{"text":"Waited about five minutes to be helped and I understand they were a little busy, but this wasn't the problem I ordered Kung pao chicken and they were out so they said they would call me when it would be ready so I waited. While I waited my food was just sitting there getting cold so ten minutes past and I went to the employee and asked about my order and they said they were still making the Kung pao chicken. I looked to my left and another customer was getting Kung pao chicken served so I was like are you serious. All they did was give me the next side up for the inconvenience not even an apology for the cold food I was going to eat. Never going back to panda again terrible service ever!!"}
{"text":"Terrible not closing for another 40 minutes when I asked and they couldn't make more chow mein. How do you not have something when that's one of your main items"}
{"text":"No line. No wait. Friendly staff. Food was fresh, tasty & proportionate. They were patient with me & my kids & nice.   The location is fairly hidden in the plaza which is why no line or wait. Tables were clean. They welcome you when you walk in."}
{"text":"My child picked up dinner one evening and when she came home we found a glove in her food.  Disgusting.  I called immediately but since it was closing time I waited until the next day.   I returned the food and they did give me back my money.  I gave the man my phone number to pass it on to the manager.   I have waited a few days now and not a single response from anyone.  Poor customer satisfaction.  Will never eat there again"}
{"text":"I can't even explain how frustrating this place is!!! It seems that everytime we decide to give this place another chance something is always wrong. My question is why do you always close before your posted hours??? Like 3-4 hours early!!! If its not that then its also your customer service just sucks!!! The least you can do is actually appologize for the inconvenience not just stand their laughing like dumb A****!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner here last night and the food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours. They didn't have a very big selection and I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I like coming here for the food but there are many times I decide not to go to this location. (1) The line is always so long and it takes forever to get your food and leave. I have waited in line for 40 minutes before!  (2)I have also walked in and there was trash everywhere. The trash cans were over flowing and people started leaving their trash on top of the trash cans where the trays go.  (3) I may be the 3rd person in line and still have to wait 15-20 minutes because people go in and order 5 plates to go!  (4)One thing that totally disgusted me was that one of the cooks dropped their cooking tool on the ground and they literally picked it back up and kept cooking with it!!"}
{"text":"I cannot tell a lie. Gulp.  I kinda, sorta, maybe, enjoyed my Panda Express...a little. The shame, the shame. It's an unauthentic fast-food version of Chinese fast-food (like Pei-Wei) and in a pinch, it'll do.   It was one of those nights where I was at work, didn't know what I wanted to eat, but it sure wasn't the Healthy Choice frozen meal in the freezer. Then it dawned on me, I might as well give Panda Express a shot, since I haven't been there since my teenage years.   On my plate, steamed white rice, steamed veggies, Kobari Beef and the Honey Walnut Shrimp.   The Kobari beef was salty, slightly spicy and sweet...the shrimp, battered, deep fried and coated in a sweet sauce with candied walnuts.    I felt guilty eating it.  It was obviously not the healthiest meal. (Despite the white rice and steamed veggies...I did a quick Google search and it turned out my meal had well over 1,000 calories, but let's not think about that.)   Overall, it is what it is.  Fast-food American Chinese food.  The food isn't necessarily fresh-- although I do see fresh produce in the prep area...the shrimp did have a strange previously-frozen quality. If they offered brown rice and some healthier options, I just may hit it up again when the urge strikes."}
{"text":"Picked some up last night. The customer service was amazing. If I was hiring a customer service rep I would hire Tanise. She tried to offer me everything I sure they were promoting without being annoying. The food was yummy as always. This is my go to food when I really don't feel like cooking. Thanks Tanise. Panda, you should promote her!"}
{"text":"The food looked like it's been sitting there for hours. I picked a few things that I really didn't want to eat but it looked more fresh compared to the other food items. The service was good but not a fan how the food looked...dry and sitting there for hours or so. Maybe it was the weather because it was raining...who knows."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage we went to grab a quick dinner the other night. I ended up with food poisoning and missed work and vacation. I will never return to this location again!"}
{"text":"Unreal food! Quick easy and cheep! The orange chicken is amazing! Nice meal when walking the strip and wasted and just need a quick meal."}
{"text":"I usually love Panda Express but I won't be coming back to this one! The two ladies working were really rude to me were slamming my food down on the counter. To top it off they barely spoke English. I've never had an experience like this at a panda express. I won't be back here that's for sure!  This two ladies needs to learn about customer services is all about!!!"}
{"text":"Food tastes different from other locations. I've had better Panda Express. Customer service is great!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this location gets inconsistent reviews, I love this Panda store. I have been a regular customer for over two years, 3 times a week. I am always greeted when I walk in and they don't hesitate to cook fresh food if I don't like what I see.The managers have all been great, I just wish one would stay a little longer. Diana is super nice and so is Rae. I think its a hidden gem, its rarely crowded like the others and I get extras from time to time."}
{"text":"We come to this panda all the time, but tonight was just kind of annoying. They had almost no food done. Me and my husband had to wait about 10-15 minutes for our food to be out. The girl didn't even ask if we wanted to take it to go or anything. The manager walked in and almost bumped into my table. The workers weren't at their best tonight. I'm sorry /:"}
{"text":"We stopped in from out of town on a Sunday morning looking for somewhere to eat. We decided  on Chinese.Panda express was supposed to be open at 11 at 11 0 5 we are still waiting for them to unlock the door.  We call to see if their hours had changed and they just didn't post them. Hello what time do you open? 11 o'clock.  OK it's 11 0 5 We got a late start this morning it's gonna be a while. NO apology, did not unlock the door and let us in so we could look at the menu or nothing.  We left. I guess Panda Express has enough business that they don't give a s*** about their customers"}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru, and spent 49 bucks on 3 panda bowls  3 chicken egg rolls, 1 large side of orange chicken and a large side of beef and broccoli except they gave me a large side of broccoli no beef,  and the portions were terrible all three bowls had hardly any chicken on them and lil bit of noodles compared to other Panda Express restaurants I've been to. It's a Lil frustrating once you get all the way home and discover what you actually paid for  lol"}
{"text":"This is the only Panda Express I will come to. The service is always great!  Joe the manager is very nice. So is the other chick I just can't remember her name. The cashier Drew is always very nice and friendly. Everyone here treats me like family. The food is normally on point but there has been a time when it wasnt. Hence why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Besides that I love it here!! I recommend of your in the area come and stop in!"}
{"text":"The new P.E. In Avon is okay. I ordered the honey shrimp and Beijing beef while my wife ordered mushroom chicken and orange chicken with a side of Rangoon. The Rangoon was dry with no sauce to dip. The chow mein was also dry that being said the entrees were good. Also parking by drive thru is bad so be careful."}
{"text":"Foods decent and it's always very clean inside. But I think waiting over 15 minutes for a 3-entree is ridiculous and then giving me a coupon for a buy 2 get 1 free would make things better. SMH"}
{"text":"So you mess up my order & then make me pay for it? this would be the second time now , what's the point of driving through when I have to get out and go back in anyways ? Also maybe it would help to have someone working the drive thru that's speaks English so they can understand your order."}
{"text":"One star today! Food the same, nothing special but why do they act like they (employees ) are paying for the peppers in the kung pao chicken. It's spicy so give me peppers and I don't need that look of disgust. This location not much different than the two I've visit in Chandler.  Was pretty busy but served pretty fast. Are they timed, because I feel rushed when ordering.  Now the last thing, Panda is falling in line with so many business that allow people to bring their pets (not a service dog) inside. The difference is this is a place to eat with food exposed. I don't get it, am I wrong to want to eat without a dog sitting ten feet from me. Don't get me wrong, I realize the impact some pets (service or not) play in some people's lives but be respectful of other people."}
{"text":"Tried this location twice and both times my choice of food was tasteless.  Location very busy and found staff pleasant. I usually order 50/50 on Chow Mein and Fried Rice.  Nothing special. Today I had Kung Pao Chicken and Beijing Beef. Both are listed as spicy, neither one was close to spicy and what happen to the dry chiles? Chicken and Beef was tasteless and probably needed more cooking time. Just hope I don't get sick again, had Sonic (Buckeye) last night. If all food prepared and bagged ahead of time just like other locations,  what is the problem? Forgot about my chicken egg roll"}
{"text":"First time to this location, I \"usually\" go to one of 3 other locations.  I was doing take-out.  Got in line, only 1 person in front of me.  It took this lady quite a while - several minutes - to decide what she wanted.  There was one other person running the line but she was busy with other customers already ahead.   When she finally got this person's order and got it completely done - versus handing it off to the next person in line like at other Panda Express's, she got a drive-thru order coming through her headphones so she started preparing THAT person's food who hadn't waited at all simply because they were in the drive-thru! That person disappeared to the window area.  Meanwhile, the other, now-lone, attendant was finally finished with the other customers and came back to take my order. AT this point, there were 7 other people behind me yet no sign in sight of anyone to come help with this mess.  I get around the glass case only to find my favorite Kung Pao Chicken is all out.  Gag.  So, if I want it, I have to wait.  Well, they said it would be \"right up\" so I waited.  The attendant took care of every other single person in line, including getting their orders and operating the cash register - which took her quite a while - and they STILL hadn't gotten any chicken out there.  I sat down at a table, now watching no customers at all in line.  I've been there going on 20 minutes now for a take out order.  When they finally came out with the chicken, I then went to the condiment counter and found they were out of mustard.  How many more ways can this visit turn South?   I ask the lady to get more.  She does not ask me how many I wanted but comes back with 4.  I like hot mustard, I would have taken 6 or 7 if the dispenser would have been stocked.   I was offered nothing in \"compensation\" for the extremely long wait for a food item that I have NEVER seen any other Panda Express out of - Kung Pao Chicken that is -because that's one of their favorite sellers. They hadn't even started to prepare any more until I got up there looking for some! I have NEVER experienced this kind of pathetic service at any of the other 3 Panda Express's I go to -- well I have been to even more on a one-time basis simply because of being in an area that I don't normally go to and eating there, such as the one in Casa Grande.  This isn't going to cause' me to ban Panda Express, not at all, but it IS going to cause me to NEVER come to this particular location again!  Edited: I called corporate to see if I could get a freebie out of it and I unabashedly tell you that yes, they offered me one and yes, I am getting it via USPS.  The person on the phone was not liking hearing about the fact that there was no Kung Pao Chicken despite the fact that there were 2 cooks working in the back.  I won't be using the freebie at that location, however."}
{"text":"It should not take 50mins to go through the drive thru to get food. When I got to the window the lady said she was going to check on my order and then disappeared, 4 other employees were just standing around not doing anything. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Always super friendly and greet us with a smile. I would suggest this location because it has fresh food at all times of the day, unlike others that leave is under the heating lights. We have had nothing but delicious food and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Came in with my girlfriend to get some dinner tonight and wow I was flabbergasted at the level of unprofessionalism at this location. Not only did the staff have a bad attitude but when I asked the server if I could get teriyaki sauce she asked the 15 year boy at the grill if he could make more and he sneered Back no I don't know how to make that..... after an awkward silence I left. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Literally just found a piece of hair in my meal. I was about to eat it and my sister pulled it from my mouth just in time. It was not mine or her hair as the strand did not match our hair. Not even moments later we found even more hair in it. I'm disgusted and I don't think I can even eat here or any panda ever again."}
{"text":"We've been here several times. Food is always fresh and delicious. Also love the drive thru!"}
{"text":"This panda express is a hit or miss. Today it was pretty good. The rice wasn't fresh but wasn't old either.  My cream cheese ragoons  were alright. I suggest that you look at the food before you decide to eat here.  Like I said they are a hit or miss.   For it being in a mall that has less than half the stores open they did pretty well today."}
{"text":"I always come to this spot because it's closer to where I live. The employees are usually extremely nice although today I did have an employee who ruined my experience here. I've never seen this customer before her name was breeysi. When I first pulled up to the speaker I asked for a minute, literally 5 seconds later with no guests behind me she asks again, I politely said not yet and she smacked her mouth probably not knowing whether I could hear and seemed upset as if I was taking much of her time. When I get to the window she makes no eye contact nor says a word just my total. Even when taking my card there was no word exchange. Finally when I leave she says \"have a nice day\" but still no eye contact and shuts the window right away. Just rude customer service. Happily the order was correct but hopefully next time I'll look forward to the other cheerful employe"}
{"text":"Our server - whose name I don't recall but the reciept says it was Karen G. I do know it was a different girl than the one who took our pay and she was so good I just want to make sure I mention all this. So I hadn't been to Panda in a while and you had 2 new dishes I hadn't tried before - a steak thing and a shrimp thing so I asked for a taste of each. Karen was so fabulous and gave me a bite of each - she offered it to my husband too - but he's weird about tasing thing....don't ask I have no idea - I love it - anyway- they were both incredible and that's what I got for my meal. Then my husband got one of the same dishes with his meal. I guess it's not just that she gave me those bites, but she was so nice and was fun to banter with over my excitement of how tasty they were - it just made the whole visit wonderful. I like going places where I'm not treated like a number - but like a person that they are glad to see and that's just how I felt here. Our cashier was also very nice and friendly. I was very excited over the dinner to come and she joined me in my excitement and joked around with me and my husband - we LOVED it!"}
{"text":"26 minutes wait in drive through. Food was soggy. When one car takes too long with large order why don't they ask that person to pull to the side so the rest of us can go ahead?"}
{"text":"First off, service was speedy and the cashier was friendly. The food was the perfect temperature and the portions were good for the money. One of my sides was the honey walnut shrimp and I usually always feel that I get like 4-5 lil pieces of shrimp, which is not worth paying $1.25 EXTRA on top of what you are already paying for a plate when you don't even receive a reasonable portion amount. This time however I felt like it was a fair portion. Everything was fresh and tasted great, no complaints. Very happy with my all around experience!"}
{"text":"Panda Express kindly donated coupons and cookies at the After School Cool for Hamilton High School's Link Crew. We appreciate your kindness and will always support you! Link Crew loves you!"}
{"text":"Okay just to start, this is a Panda express. It's definitely not the beeeest Chinese food place out there but I can appreciate the food. It is probably the cleanest Chinese fast food I can eat. I have no idea what it is, but I can consistently eat here and not get sick. I don't know if there is MSG or isn't or what but it's just a personal experience and YMMV. Shout out to the Lo Mein for being al dente like I like em. Overall, everything on the menu isn't too die for but definitely good enough for a quick bite. The actual restaurant is clean and in good running condition.  Makes me feel good about eating inside since it is clean and has a modern look to it. It's definitely not the best place in Champaign but it is a keeper. Keep on keeping on Panda express"}
{"text":"A healthy alternative to all of the other fast food places around it.  The service is bad though. Like... pretty bad."}
{"text":"It was good and fresh for \"fast food\".  The place seemed clean and it was a decent value.  I do wish the fried rice had some more flavor."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMMMMMM....(my mouth is full.  Can't say anyrhing else)  :)~"}
{"text":"Food is too expensive. The quality is too cheap and poorly prepared to justify the outrageous prices. The staff will likely ignore you until they feel like doing their jobs. The worst Panda Express I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I went to this Panda Express on Cave Creek and Union Hills. I was disgusted and walked out. The cooks were not using gloves and one cook in particular was weighing the lettuce on the scale with no gloves on while scratching his head. Yulk! The cooks need to wear gloves when preparing food. I live in the neighborhood and I will NEVER go back to that location again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I had horrible food poisoning after eating the chow mein and orange chicken. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"One hour till closing and the teenagers they have running this place are shutting down the line and leaving the nastiest looking food on display --- and 8 customers walked in expecting something professional. I'm heading over to Signal Butte next time."}
{"text":"Excellent customer services 5 star definitely,food wise it's a bit dry on brown rice."}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat. The food is fresh and tastes fantastic will get again to try the soup."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Panda Express I really enjoy the food very much otherwise I would  not return. I have been to several of the store throughout Arizona and am a usually very satisfied with the food and service, some are better than others.  On almost every occasion when I visit Panda Express in the evening there is a pretty good sized line which I have come a custom too, I will have to admit though the line moves really fast!  The Panda Express that I have been going to (1752 S. Signal Butte Road, Mesa) for almost 2 1/2 years now has got to be one of the SLOWEST franchises around. On most occasions and depending on the line size I will wait in excess of 25 minutes.  The only thing that I see that is different between this location and other locations that I have been at is the people behind the counter.  They are the slowest servers, they have very little customer service skills, they ignore you, they don't smile, the don't day hello, the just don't care weather you are there or not.  There is no communications between the other co-workers, the constantly put my order with other customer orders including bagging them into another customers bag. I usually have someone else with me, so we clearly let them know the items will be paid for together, and 80% of the time that have already bagged the first persons meal and the cashier is ringing up the item before the second tray is done. When we explain every time that the orders are together, they look at us like really!  I am just not sure why I have to keep track of all this, I am a paying customer not an employee.  Up until the last few visits, I have simply tolerated this service. The time before last I complained to the Manager on Duty nicely about the poor service and she told me she would talk to the employees and promised me the next time I come in I would see the improvement and apologized.  So when I visited on 5/19/2012 I was excited to see the improvements in the customer service. To my surprise I walk in the door, there was no line. (I wonder Why?)  So we walked right up to the counter, no one on the front line (there were 3 employees) looked up, greeted us, smiled, said hi, showed any urgency to serve the customer that pay there wages, as a matter of fact we waited almost 2 1/2 minutes while that exchanged metal food trays out before they even acknowledged our existence.    I let the employee that finally decided to help up that I wanted a 2 entree meal and she immediately wanted to know what 2 entree's I wanted, I am not sure why all of a sudden she is in such a BIG hurry, How Rude.  I told here that I wouldn't know what I wanted until I stepped around the counter to make that choice.  I made my choices and she served the first one and went for the second one which was at the very end and looked like it had been sitting in the pan for an hour, it was dried out and up from the heat pan. I made the comment that it was awful dray and if there was new batch coming out and she asked if I wanted to wait which I replied yes to, she then gave me a funny look and proceeded to scrape out the dried up stuff from the container in to the trash.  While waiting for the fresh batch they replaced 2 more hot trays with new product and in front of me picked up the old hot tray that sits in the hot water and not only let the water drip into the hot tray of food behind it, but proceeded to let the disgusting water with things floating in it to literally run into the new hot tray that she was scraping the old food into.  Can you say hello 'Health Department.'  Even worse she had a rag in her hand which could easily been used to stop the water from falling off the tray!!!!!!!!  In the mean time the cashier had not only bagged my tray which never got my second entree in with other meal that was ordered she started to ring up and rush us out, when I explained that the one plastic tray on the bottom didn't have the second entree she said that's ok! Again why all of a sudden are we in  A BIG HURRY!  I approached the same Manager outside eating with 2 other employees to let her know that again of the terrible service and that she promised me that it would be fixed the next time I came in.  All she could do is say \"I talked to them\" not even sure that I got a sorry or anything other than her pointing the finger towards he employees. I brought up the water dripping from the pan into the new hot tray and although she looked concerned she did nothing or even tried to apologize or offer anything other than finger pointing.  It might be a case that she is more like friends with the employees versus being the BOSS, looks like they are running the show to me.  I let the manager know that I would never return to that location, and again got little to know response.  What a shame, need to clean house on that place. I am wondering if the short line was a sign of problems a brewing at that location.  Sincerely, A disappointed customer. Charles H."}
{"text":"It was good one time, all the other times the food was old and stale. Bad taste. Very inconsistent quality."}
{"text":"I think that you can have more kinds of vegetable choices. Besides, if you can have dumplings, that will be perfect for me!"}
{"text":"I Love Panda! But don't come to this location after 8pm because they only have 3 options of Entrees. They apparently stop making food at 8pm and they only sell what they have left. That is Horrible Service!!!"}
{"text":"I Went today  and I ordered two plates, when I paid I asked for the spicy sauce and the worked gave me one .... he only put one fork in there when he clearly saw 2 people standing behind me and there was two plates. I had to go back and ask for more. All the workers had attitude. Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about panda. But every freakin time I go I get the girggles in my stomach after..."}
{"text":"I Have been driving by that store all summer watching it being built and I was exited to finally try it out after noticing it opened up a few weeks ago.  I waited a few weeks before going to try it out So they would have time to establish good service. I went through the drive through on a Friday night around 6:30 and was highly disappointed in what they gave me. The cheap styrofoam clamshell to go box they gave me had very small portions of enterees and a heaping amount of side noodles. Not proportionate what so ever. I felt extremely ripped off for the 7.00$ I payed. There was only around 5 tiny bits of meat in the whole to go box. They didn't even give me utencles not to mention a napkin or a single packet of soy sauce. Do your self a favor and just go to the Wendy's next door JUNK!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered the steamed veges in a bowl. The veges looked wilted and dried up. I probably could have gotten some fresh veges but the 3 cooks were sitting at a table laughing about videos they were watching. All the food looked like it had been sitting for a while definitely not fresh. I won't be back."}
{"text":"this is the best panda express in phoenix, great customer service and the food is never dry of overly greasy.  believe me ive tried other panda express places in phx and mesa! its a good bargain for your dollar- im impressed i can feed my family of 4 for less than 20 bucks (most times)... yum yum orange chicken.   its right off the free way and convenient if youre on the go.  ill keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Where to start, first off, there was a bit of a line which I am okay with, staff did a good job of managing a decent amount of people, but once I got to the front of the line, I was greeted by a strange looking ginger boy, I asked if I could have some chow mein noodles but try to avoid the veggies, the strange boy looked at me and called me names, at first I was awed at how someone can do this to a customer, I shook it off asked for orange chicken and waited in line while that same ginger boy went around and slapped another workers behind. I was in shock about how poorly this establishment is run! This strange looking ginger boy needs a stern talking too!"}
{"text":"Looks like they wanted to close early.  They were out of most of the entrees, and of course, all 3 entrees I wanted they were out of. After hearing it would be a 10 minute wait for just the teriyaki chicken, I walked out. It s 8:19pm, the posted hours are until 9:30pm - wtf?"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times, but this was the first time my mother has visited Panda Express. The staff that helped us (Alex and Angelina? Angelica?) were super friendly. The food is awesome and my mother loved it. Good first impression.  Keep up the good work over there!"}
{"text":"All I wanted were some deep-fried foods.  Spring rolls, crab rangoon, maybe some rice to go with.  The rangoon might have been passable even without crab, but it was soggy along the bottom.  The spring rolls were crisp, but I don't think I even have words for what was wrong with the flavor.  Never again."}
{"text":"The food was great tasting, but the customer service was terrible, the whole store seemed to be disorganized... it took close to 15 min for a batch of fried rice. The last taking my order just walked away twice to go talk to someone in the middle of taking my order. So all in all, great food... not so good customer service."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????2?????(??????????)?????????????????"}
{"text":"Came at 9:04pm (again) ... Only one person was working the counter (again) ... Everyone else was blatantly ignoring the line & doing closing duties (again) .... The bum ass shift manager came up (again) .... Went on & on about how they have a right to ignore guests & close .... (again) .... They gave me a hard time about cooking fresh food, even though there was ZERO chowmein, ZERO orange chicken, ZERO sweet fire.... (Again).... So I should pay 25.00 for food I don't want??? .... Oh, and the iced tea was all gone (again)  Maybe this location should consider a 9pm closing time because after 9pm, NO ONE HERE is interested in customer service. Horrible."}
{"text":"If you close at 10, why would you not continue making food for your customers until 10? To have only a \"selection\" to choose from when walking in the establishment is so lazy, I don't care how efficient you're trying to be. I have worked at 2 fast food places in my teens and have never been trained to do something as absurd as telling customers \"We don't have that right now because we didn't want to make too much and waste any of it.\" I just cannot believe a chain as big as Panda has their customers settle on what to eat, so they don't possibly waste extra food."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the level of incompetence that has permeated itself in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place after eating orange chicken and fried rice. I'm thinking they let their rice sit out too long and/or not at the right temperature. It needs to be at least 140 degrees and no more than two hours. Otherwise bacteria will grow. I will never come back. EVER."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was, as always, at Panda Express, wonderful. However, THIS Panda Express location left a lot to be desired. My husband and I each ordered the Panda Bowl. with mixed veggies as our side. My husband ordered the pepper chicken; while I ordered the Five Flavor Shrimp. I was aware that the Shrimp is considered a premium entrée, and therefore has a $1.25 upcharge. However, I was rather dismayed to note that for $7.35 I got 5 shrimp!! Yes, I did indeed count them, as I noticed that the server who prepared my bowl counted them. While the flavor was delightful, the quantity was dismaying.  Furthermore, there were several employees behind the counter, one was even preparing his own dish of food; forcing the servers who were waiting on customers to wait while he loaded up his plate. As mentioned, there were several people behind the counter standing around talking and waving their arms about. We were the last customers waiting to be served for several minutes, and yet, the trash cans were so over-filled that the trash was overflowing the can and falling out the flap. and one the door wouldn't even close. There were dirty tables, trash and food on the floor, a wet floor stand right in front of the walk-up line, and the drinks station needed servicing.  We will normally search out a Panda Express wherever we are, as we feel that the quality is a bit healthier than most fast food. However, we will NEVER frequent this particular Panda Express again, nor will we recommend it to others. All in all, this was a very disappointing Panda Express experience."}
{"text":"I like this Panda Express. Fast service, clean environment and fresh food. The food is rotated more quickly at this location, so that is a plus."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:45 on a Friday, thinking they close at 10:30. Wrong! All locked up. So, I can't comment on the food lol."}
{"text":"Panda Express is the type of place where I would go if I was interested in eating bad chinese food but also don't want to get sick. It serves very americanized chinese food with understandable names. I think that their portions are somewhat small for the price, but at least its safe to eat at and gets you done fast. It is a 3 star restaurant except I have to deduct a star for the strange odor that comes out of the restaurant onto the sidewalk and for the small portion sizes."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday around 330pm and they hardly had any food prepared, I wanted orange chicken and beef and broccoli but there was no beef and broccoli, barely any mixed veggies no Beijing steak or Kung Pao chicken or string bean chicken or mushroom chicken. My only options were walnut shrimp, teriyaki chicken and black pepper chicken. So I went with the black pepper chicken along with my orange chicken. The reason this place got 3 stars from me instead of 1 star is because the customer service was pleasant and the food was really hot and good the way I like it."}
{"text":"went to Panda Express many times and it's delicious but I have never gone to this one. I was in the area so I went the Lee Lee Supermarket to get a boba. It was delicious but I'm talking about Panda Express. I got orange chicken and fried rice to go and when I got home and smelt the food, my mouth was literally watering. The orange chicken is delicious but a little spicy. The orange syrup that they put on there is very creamy and it hits the spot. It's crunchy on the outside and pretty soft on the inside. The crunchy outside gives it an incredible texture and the chicken is very flavorful. The fried rice tasted good and it was buttery a little bit. When I was there I sampled the spicy chicken and it was good but not spicy. It tasted like orange chicken but less syrup. Believe it or not, the orange chicken. is spicer then their spicy chicken. I will go to Panda Express again but I don't know if I will go to this location. For this is the best chinese food I could find in the area."}
{"text":"They so slow.... I order food on the app when i got there they said they didnt get the tag so i showed them the app reciept they still didnt want to give me it so i payed for it again nd they got my order wrong when i got home i was so mad the manager martha was horrible nd everyone who worked there."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I have been in the drive through 20 minutes waiting and there are 3 cars Infront on me. Not one car has moved in 20 minutes. One car finally got out of line, parked, and went inside. This was after he failed at getting someone's attention at the drive through window. SAD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is always great. I always order the same thing for me veggie mix and steamed rice. This particular visit It was a to go order , food for the husband and me. I got to the cashier I paid . I got my receipt i didn't look at it, my fault. Once I got home i thought to myself it seemed a little bit more expensive than usual. I noticed my veggie mix was charged as an entree which is more expensive. I decided to give them a call , i explained to the lady i was charged wrong and she decided to argue and say the veggie mix was not a side!!  All i wanted was an okay bring your receipt next time and we can take care of it but no. So at this point i am like really?? I don't live too far so i went back ask to speak to the manager and showed him my receipt. He noticed i was in fact charged wrong, he end it up giving me my money back for my food. Which he didn't have to , i didn't care if he just gave me the difference . He made the experience much better once again thank goodness for people who know what they are doing."}
{"text":"They didn't know how to break my 100 lol.gave me one soy sauce packet for my food. ONE. PACKET."}
{"text":"I love going to the panda express very good food staff very nice. I want to say there is a cashier that when he is working is always very nice and happy and makes the costumers feel welcome his name is Cesar very nice guy"}
{"text":"This place is always long lines.  Told to wait 6 minutes for teriyaki chicken....ok.   Then they ran out for orange chicken while I waited.  Another 5 minutes wait.  Been here 30 minutes waiting in line and for food.  Meanwhile my other food is sitting cold in the boxes on the counter.  Time to find another location.   Edit.   Oh and when I got home my order was missing items."}
{"text":"The person behind the counter was rude and I'm not coming back to this location so stay away if you want rudeness and someone that talks down to you"}
{"text":"Decided to update my review. My last visit was much better. The staff was friendly, helpful, courteous and I was out in five minutes. I hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"Not pleased the staff sprayed cleaner near us while dining. The staff wanted to close the dining room at exactly 9:30. We still had 15 minutes before closing. We were the only patrons in dining room and staff members decided to clean right next to us, adding cleaning mist and smell to our dinner. Trust me Panda we were in a hurry too! We would have been gone by the time you locked doors but instead you made us feel very unwelcome. Even though you have the market cornered in the area for Asian cuisine I will happily make the effort to drive into Goodyear for a peaceful dining experience."}
{"text":"Drive thru is ridiculous, waited more than 15 mins for a one person order. Pretty much-they suck!"}
{"text":"Me and my family and friends came to Panda Express for a quick dinner. My friend hasnt eaten Panda Express for 3 years, after finding a hair in her food and getting stuck between her teeth. She has been traumatized since but finally decided to try it again. We got home and the food was good, halfway through our meal there was a hair found in one of the meals. We are all blondes and the hair was short and black. It is really gross to find a hair in your food, we all threw our food away. We won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The chicken was ok..but if they could please COOK their veggies....that would be lovely. My broccoli was very raw and undercooked. Not really gourmet."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, but every time I go, the service is so slow. I'll be 3rd or 4th in line and it will take me 20-25 minutes to get through to pay. You would think when you have a line of 20+ people you would try to hustle."}
{"text":"Such a terrible drive through experience. Waited in line for 10-15 minutes between cars. Should have gone inside. Chicken in mushroom chicken was gross and fatty. Barely any beef in beef broccoli and the broccoli was not cooked. I like crunchy veggies but this broccoli was straight up not cooked and greasy. Basically just ate the brown rice with the soy sauce they put in the bag which was good."}
{"text":"It's 9 pm and all the workers are pretending like they're closed....doors are locked. Lame!"}
{"text":"This is an attractive location...great for both dine in and drive-thru. Their drive thru has to be one of the fastest of any fast food restaurant. I can always count on getting in and out very quickly. And the food is very tasty. Always a safe choice."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. If you've had Panda Express in the States and then try this place, you'll be grossly disappointed!  The food tastes like cardboard, small portion size, VERY expensive and is of low quality."}
{"text":"The orange chicken is so good! As are the egg rolls definitely a good choice for a fast food Chinese option"}
{"text":"I rarely come to Panda Express but for some particular reason I was craving it..now orange chicken and honey glazed shrimp with fried rice was my choice oh and veggie rolls!!! The flavors were exceptional if weren't for all that soy sauce..just saying if the soy sauce wasn't so strong the chicken and shrimp I would've enjoyed more. I'll keep going back but not often just every now and then when I get the craving for it."}
{"text":"This is the best panda express I've ever been too, and trust I've been to a lot. They are very nice and helpful. The will make what ever you ask if need it a special way. And the manager Chris is super nice and helpful. Thank you guys so much!"}
{"text":"I like Panda Express food but over the last few years their servings have gotten too small. We used to get the Panda Feast, I say used to because we quit going there all together. They used to fill those qt. containers until they could barely get them closed, now they fill the containers a little over 3/4 full, but charg full price. This just wasn't happening with one particular server but all of them so I think maybe their managers are telling them to under fill containers. I don't know that for sure, but what I do know is that I am not particularly fond of getting ripped off so to avoid getting burned we just don't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Went to this Panda after a long week of work. Just thought to myself \"you know I just want to bathe 'my feeling in fried rice\". I got to the panda at 8:30 on a Friday, and they were OUT OF ALL RICE?  What Chinese food place runs out of rice?  This is like McDonalds running out of fries. And then, to top it off, there were no fortune cookies in my bag. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. My feelings are forever drowned in....chow mein"}
{"text":"I'm a local to this restaurant live around the corner actually, had really upsetting issues with speed of service...under staff! And when I was checking out they refused my military discount that I have been given time and time again! The Hispanic gal at the register was VERY rude! Makes me wanna travel to a different store that's farther away just to be satisfied! I'm really upset and disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give half a star.  They ran out of 2 menu items I wanted, so I had to wait about 15+  minutes for them to be remade.  Meanwhile, my order, partially complete, is  just sitting on the  counter and getting cold.  I was also asked to pay, before my orders were even complete??  Why?  This makes no sense.  Unless, it's to make things easier on the employee, attending the register - forget what makes most sense to the customer!!   I was also promised my orders would be completed right away, once the food came out.  Not!   So, the food comes out that I'm waiting...still waiting... and customer after customer going ahead of me and I'm standing right in the front waiting, another 5 minutes go by, ridiculous!!  Where is the customer service?  Rule number one, don't make a customer who has been waiting for several minutes, wait even longer?  Hello.   Like they forgot why I'm there and what I'm waiting for in the first place?  Go back to basic C/S training, everyone.  I get home and my food is now cold and gross. I won't be going back.  So do yourself a favor and visit another location, even if several miles away, it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Their orange chicken is to good I love it and can't get enough !!  Great clean place  Friendly employees Good location  Good vibes"}
{"text":"So, I read the reviews but thought \"it's Panda Express, how bad can it be?\"  Well, trust the reviews. It is bad.  I want on a Thursday for lunch around 12:10.  There was a line out the door and only one person working the counter. She was both serving and cashiering.  Finally another employee came from the back to assist.  Both her and the first employee were horrible.  The customers in front of me were obviously friends of the women who were working.  They decided that right then was a great time to hold a conversation about nothing to do with food.  Finally those customers ordered their food and moved on to pay where the next employee spent time catching up with them as well.  So I guess those customers were friends with both counter workers.  Anyway, my turn to order.  They were out of everything and kept yelling to the cooks that they needed more this, that , and the other. The cooks were MIA.  I decided on the walnut shrimp since everything else was out or looked like it had been in the warmers past their prime.  Mistake... I paid $1.25 extra for the crispy, walnut shrimp and it was aweful.  Total mush and over cooked.  Now, I do not frequent Panda Express a lot, but of every one that I have eaten at, this is by far the WORST ever...bad food, bad service, long waits.  Do yourself a big favor and pick another location, PLEASE!"}
{"text":"I agree with the majority of the reviews about all Panda Express restaurants. It is not authentic Chinese food. However, it is always made fresh at the store and it is very flavorful. What they do not have in authenticity they make up for it in consistency and good value."}
{"text":"Consistently good. The idea behind Panda Express is simple but ingeniously cunning. I wish I would have thought of the idea. Great tasting Chinese food that's clean, fast and affordable. I love P.E.  !! Make sure you fill out the surveys...free entree."}
{"text":"Whoever the bigger taller lady is working right now is the reason why I will never come back here. 8$ for a 1 piece of beef and a few pieces of broccoli that's NOT an enttre give people what they pay for. Half ass employees don't even pay attention!"}
{"text":"July 2017 update. I decided to give this restaurant another try. I ordered orange chicken and fried rice. Ate it at 9 pm and was deathly sick at midnight. So far this has cost me two days of work, a hospital visit, and the cost of medications. I've never been so sick. This tells me I'll never eat there again. In fact the nurses at the hospital I went to said they won't eat there again either.    Previous review - This place has to be run by someone who simply doesn't care about the customers. I've eaten at numerous Panda Express restaurants before and have never been treated like this before. The sign says they close at 10:30 pm. At 9:50 they said the kitchen is closed and the only reason they stay open until 10:30 is to sell the rest of the food that was made.   Look I get trying to have less waste. No business wants to make food and throw it away. The problem here is that they are out of the most popular item (orange chicken). Maybe smaller batches should be made after 9 pm. I don't know, I'm not the manager. What I do know is that if I was, I would have it clearly displayed on the door what the true hours are.  In other words, kitchen hours versus dining room/drive up hours. Just be forewarned that if you want some Chinese food after 9 pm, and this is your choice for a fast food pick me up, you may be stuck with the last two Veggi Rolls because the rest is gone."}
{"text":"This particular Panda Express has my favorite pepper chicken with celery, so kudos to that! Also I sampled their orange chicken and it was actually good. It wasn't too sweet or too saucy or anything like other locations. I love their white fried rice too! A good location when your in the mood for Americanized Chinese fast food!"}
{"text":"I made a yelp account just so I could write this review, that's how rude the staff is here! The first time I came here I thought maybe it was just a one time thing. But they are consistently, unfailingly, disrespectful. I will never in my life come back here again."}
{"text":"Very aloof and disinterested employees at this location, most of them young. Only a couple here are friendly. Lots of grumpy attitudes, misplaced orders, and they forgot the sauce on my teriyaki chicken last week. I had a large about six-foot young woman who works here yell at me once and cop an attitude. Please hire friendlier and more mature people. It's so sad how bad customer service seems to be the rule in most Scottsdale low-end places (like gas stations and fast food restaurants). Just last week I was cursed at by an employee at another business just around the corner from this Panda Express. I have received better customer service and even smiles in MARYVALE than I have in many places here in Scottsdale. For those of you who don't know about Maryvale, it's the worst part of Phoenix where violent crime and gangs and drug dealers abound. What a shame and this is supposed to be the educated part of town."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Came in on a Saturday night at 9:20 exactly (website & door said they closed at 10). As soon as I walked in I noticed an employee and customer were arguing about what time they closed. The employee insisted they closed at 9 & the man had told her he looked up the hours ahead of time on their website. She came up with the excuse saying she was a new employee and didn't know. WHAT? How in the hell do you not know what time the restaurant you work at closes. She wasn't even the main problem. Ordered 2 bigger plates had to wait for chow mein & the orange chicken which was fine because I'd rather wait the extra 5 minutes for fresh food. My second bigger plate was suppose to be steamed rice with teriyaki chicken & beef & broccoli. The lady I dealt with(Gracie) poured my rice & told me there was no teriyaki chicken so I'd have to pick something else, I was a little annoyed but got over it. Turns out there was no beef & broccoli either so I just told her to forget about my 2nd bowl completely. Felt like they only made the chow mein & orange chicken because the gentleman I spoke about earlier ordered it. Gracie had a major attitude problem. I work in a restaurant myself so I get the whole don't be one of those people thing but honey you had 40 minutes till closing...and even if it was 5 min till closing you NEVER show the customer any type of disrespect. Treat others the way you want to be treated Gracie. If that was really even your name. Never will come back to this Panda. Management TAKE CARE OF YOUR STAFF ASAP, maybe they should be retrained....or better yet fired. No one should feel like a burden when they come in to eat. If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"honestly the food is just average especially noodle and rice which is pretty much tasteless, orange chicken is good but i try the new prawn with premium price but taste just so so."}
{"text":"My review is not for the food but for the bad customer service I received today at this location. We go rather often to this location and never encountered any particular problem. But this evening, we had the most awful, terrible customer experience that it is worth mentioning. We almost left without completing our order and definitely will not go back to this location. There was 2 young girls. I guess they were new. I can understand that it may be overwhelming to be new. But being nasty, arrogant and heinous with customers is just unacceptable in my book.  The manager (also new I think) did not do anything to help."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Panda around.  I ordered online and the order wasn't even started. They were out of chow mein and they didn't even start cooking more for another 10 min. This isn't the first time they're behind. This location seems to be surprised by the dinner rush all the time. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"I was impressed with how the employees dealt with a situation. I was concerned when I saw they were checking food temperatures of the different foods because they do have shrimp options and I happen to have a shellfish allergy. I asked them if they use the same thermometer for all the food and they did confirm that they wipe the thermometer with an alcohol wipe after each testing. So that put my mind at ease. Also, I was concerned that my chicken did not feel warm (it felt borderline cold/warm) they tested the chicken right in front of me and temperature was adequate. But, just for good measure they replaced my warm chicken with a fresh off the grill plate. They were courteous and professional about it, I appreciated that. Also, the chef himself came over to double check everything was satisfactory. You could tell he cared instead of writing off the situation."}
{"text":"Panda is really good.  If your looking for a decent take out chinese dinner, that's about $7 for 3 entrees, this is the place to go.  It's a bit greasy, but tastes just fine!  The only thing I really don't like is the fact that the Kung Pao Chicken tastes like pork (eww).    The resturaunt is always super clean, and so are the restrooms.   Great for eat in, or take out.  The people are always nice, but you can tell when they're having a bad day.  I love to go here to hang out with my friends and have a good time.  I'm surprised they haven't thrown us out yet! :P"}
{"text":"Avoid this location if you can.  There is always a line to/past the door at dinner time and it will end up being 20-30 minutes before you get out the door with your food.  They always seem short staffed and inefficient."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The cooks were relaxing while many of the options were empty. You get what you pay for....I must have walked in at their lunch time because the cooks seemed to be out to lunch, blankly staring at the television screens....The portion was actually  fine. Fresh and hot...NOT! I felt l was at Pop Copy!"}
{"text":"For the price, pretty good. Rice is good along with the entree choices. $6.70 for dinner plus drink is a good price. Is it the best, no but well worth the price and visit. The line is a bit slow but is expected for the style of restaurant it is. Go give it a try, worth the trip. Remember it's not Hunan on Coventry."}
{"text":"Consistency is lacking in most restaurants...especially chains. This place is the exception. The entire staff is friendly and welcoming each and every time I go. They seem to truly enjoy what they do. The food is always fresh and they give more than generous portions. Great job!"}
{"text":"Staff is wonderful and friendly, you can tell they really take pride in the food they cook. Great at accommodating my allergy concerns and they let you sample before you commit to an entree. The food is delicious, it is apparent that quality ingredients are used."}
{"text":"Last time I was in there I as told I could order just the 2 sides of beef broccoli and orange chicken. I am diabetic and didn't want the extra rice or noodles because of the carbs and starch. This time I went in and ordered the 2 sides. Instead of them being $3.10 each they wanted to charge me $16.43 telling me they were not sides, the we're Entrees.   Even if the we're entrees, they are only $4.10 each, not $7.00 each.   Last my friend was sick from eating their food. Be careful when you order from this fast food place as what they tell you might not always he correct."}
{"text":"Your restaurant is awesome. The place is always clean. The food is fabulous. The wait staff/servers are so kind. It is one of our favorite places to eat. The prices are fair as well. The cooks are always happy too. Any time they are asked to make more of a dish, that may be getting low, they always seem to smile and concur . They just seem to like what they are doing."}
{"text":"This place is poor in service. I went there and there wasn't a lot of people but the service was still slow. The place run out of food, the bins were empty... the place was clean enough but still I was not happy leaving that place   Derek, I did not put that review so you can send me free stuff and that is supposed to shut me up or write a nicer review, I can buy my own food.... trying to bribe your way out ? Is that how you do your business ? I wrote that so your business will improve, geez !"}
{"text":"Today was the first time at Panda Express. Two people ahead of me were confused how exactly to place an order.   I wanted some Teriyaki Chicken. The main bowl where it was supposed to be was empty. I could order it if I waited 20 minutes. I did wait.    Well beyond the twenty minutes and after a reminder, the chicken, vegetables, and Lo Mein arrived. There was no sauce on it. After three reminders, the sauce never arrived.   After reading terrible reviews on this place, I chanced it. It took over and hour here and it wasn't that busy.   The lesson learned here is to let a local clean and authentic Chinese restaurant do the cooking with better quantities , prices, and service."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was a long line, but there's always a long line \"great popular place\". The line went QUICK and we were offered a sample of anything. The entire staff was awesome, courteous and friendly!  The Pecan Shrimp is really Good!"}
{"text":"Its panda express, its quick, inexpensive, and for a guy like me who usually gets the same thing whenever I go to panda because Im not hard to please Im just a guy who likes some orange chicken and rice and hey if your looking for some basic chinese for your dinner I would recommend this restaurant to you."}
{"text":"While this Panda location had a slow start (no advertising???), now I'm met with lines out the door at lunch time. Thankfully, the lines go pretty quickly. Even with the crowds, they take time to do special orders with a smile.    I love that I can get veggies instead of carby sides and many low calorie choices. The food is always fresh. You can see bins of fresh veggies through the doors of the cooler. If something isn't out, they'll make it for you. The plates are over-flowing.  A side of teriyaki for the veggies has never cost me any extra. A sample is always allowed, if you ask.  The only thing I would change is putting the sauces back out instead of having to ask for them from the cashier.  Bizarre that they've had to do this in Canada but not the US.  And please, MORE LOCATIONS!!  I'm so happy to have discovered this gem!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. You have to be there at lunch or dinner rush to get fresh food that hasn't sat and dried out all day. They will usually make fresh food for you if you ask and are wiling to wait, so that's a plus. The fact that you HAVE to ask is NOT a plus, because they do not have a problem giving you a dried out nasty scoop of yuck if that's all that's in the pan.   All of the negative reviews do not surprise me. I once found a piece of broken glass in my Beijing Beef, about the size of a grain of rice. Nearly ate it but felt it at the last second.   That being said, it's a long steam table in a cruddy shopping plaza.  I'm not expecting gourmet food here. I am usually happy with what I get, especially if I get them when stuff is fresh. It is what it is."}
{"text":"The food is ok not very good . The staff not nice at all very mean . The Orange chicken does not taste like Orange chicken . Never come back again"}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter offered me two free tastes of specials. They were both great, and I settled on one (though it was $1.25 extra. They had a little mixed vegetables left and she offered me to wait a few minutes for fresh mixed veggies. This made the whole meal nice and hot. I don't know here an,e but she was tall and black. She did a really great job and I hope she's recognized for it since it was just before she left for the day and could have easily coasted in her last few minutes, but she didn't. Rare work ethic. The meal was delicious, fresh and hot and reasonably priced. The seating was comfortable and clean. Whole experience was very good."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat.  They never have enough product to sell because they are busy being incompetent to look and see what is needing to be made. Worst ever"}
{"text":"Stingy portions horrible customer service over priced not Tasty food. Sadly I guess they think because of locations you Don't Care. Abysmal won't waste time or Money here Ever. BTW if you get Soup it's A Joke."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better Panda Express restaurants I've ever been to. The quality of the food and the customer service are excellent. I would recommend this panda over others in this area."}
{"text":"Downloaded Yelp just to write this review after our experience tonight.   I've been to quite a few Panda Express's and this is hands down the worst managed. Firstly the building itself is beautiful as it's a newer Panda. But the service was inadequate and majority of the staffing was teenagers who'd rather chit chat than assist customers.   Majority of entrees were empty. When I asked for Angus Steak they just scraped up the vegetables and I had to show them how there was no meat. When we asked for Orange Chicken I got literally 4 pieces.   All in all, terrible customer service. Not blaming the teens as I used to be them, but rather the poor management and leadership of this establishment"}
{"text":"The food is palatable, but the staff has extreme difficulty executing instructions in simple English.  They cannot be understood when engaged in conversation, one must ask them to speak slowly in order to be understood.  It is also necessary to repeat constantly simple instructions and, simple orders.  I hope Panda Express Corporate is paying attention, before this store and others like it, destroy their business. I usually use the online ordering system, but this time, it didn't work properly, forcing me to make the mistake of going inside for help. I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Don't know why you guys gave such bad reviews. Panda Express at this location is one of the best I've eaten so far."}
{"text":"Handy location, yummy food, clean restaurant and courteous service.  All adds up to reasons to come here when you want some Chinese chow."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Friendly staff! Awesome awesome awesome! Panda is definitely healthier than most fast food! Love it!"}
{"text":"Word of advice, ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER. Sounds kind of silly for a place that prepares your food in front of you. But I came in during their lunch rush, the line was almost out of the door & half of the food was still being cooked from the rush. Ordered multiple orders, got all the way back to work to realize they gave me an empty container. Had to drive all the way back just to get the food that they forgot. No offer of a meal on them, free drink, not even a sorry. I mean come on, it's definitely a hassle to have to drive up and down Sunset at lunch time for someone else's mistake."}
{"text":"Was the biggest let down I had for food they were taking orders for food and was out of rice shrimp beef on front line so asked how long not making shrimp at lunch was out of rice when asked how long said 2 min well5 min later still no rice so I went down the line and counted 6 more things they were out of as how long standard answer was 2 mini went back and asked how long for the rice still 2 min so myself and several outhers left without ordering food and went next door     So stay away a far as I can tell they don't care"}
{"text":"Great customer service. The food is always very efficient. Portions of food are always good. Cashier Cesar was such a great help!!! Always smiling amazing customer service!!! Every time I go he always makes me feel welcome. I love coming here because the staff is so amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, the people there are very friendly and accomadating. Should try all the dishes, the pepper chicken, the beef dishes are good too.."}
{"text":"Wost service I've experienced in any of their locations when you get to the food line they rush you up and the manager is a rude individual!"}
{"text":"The food was warm not hot . The service was fast and friendly. The place was very clean. They need to put some woods in their fire and it will be better."}
{"text":"'Twas really fatty ewwwwwwwwwwwww and the fortune cookie was stail as butt cheeks She went #2 in the potty"}
{"text":"Haven't been there for awhile. I noticed after ordering the orange chicken, their was no chicken in the big chunks of breading. Their was little to no chicken in the chicken mushroom. Didn't know chicken would break them. Lesson learned. Don't order what you can't see. It may not be there. Their sooo crowded yet fooling all those people. Thats wrong because some people can't eat all those carbohydrates when they think its protein.. Shame on you Panda!"}
{"text":"Went in at about 8:30 and all the entrees had just enough for a spoon full. This place is very stingy and won't make fresh food unless someone asks or they are completely out. Its just bs cause then you have to wait. Then I order crab puffs and they give me spring rolls."}
{"text":"this panda has the worst customer service especially a girl named Mariela,never a knowledge us even after we told her the bath room was out of paper she didn't acknowledge it, they need to learn how to have good customer service, never will return here and then two of the girls were just sharing photos."}
{"text":"Very fast & efficient. Very clean. Food was very good & inexpensive! This is right across from Four Seasons & Mandalay Bay. Use crosswalk, easy walk & you will be happy with the good service & prices!"}
{"text":"They have a drive-thru but guess what? I have been there three times and they always give me cold left over food when I order the bowls. I would not recommend this restaurant if you go through the drive thru. Food always cold and left over like it's been sitting around. I had to talk to the manager but they are still doing it."}
{"text":"I recommend for the following reasons . First of all, they have good atmosphere. In hot summer,they have enough air condition. when you come in, you will feel cool. They have professional cleaner to clean the tables. They have enough sit and you don't need to wait long time to get a table. They have good prices for students. Even though it's not as convenient as MU, the prices is a little cheaper than MU, and never over the students budget. If you want to taste chinese food in Tempe, it's a good choose. They have good servise. All of staff will ask some question to make sure your happy. They will provide good servise with a smil. When you pay they will give a snack as present for thanks for you coming."}
{"text":"I'm from the west coast and have frequented Panda Express in Southern California. This location is prime, new, spacious & clean. There's a nice outdoor patio area included for seating. Staff was pleasant and knowledgable. Now to the quality of the food which is what is important to me when eating out. I was not impressed at all. After two visits I don't plan on returning and trying again. The Orange Chicken is not even close to what I know. Rice was very starchy, the breading had a horrible after taste. I'm disappointed since being so excited to find this location in Cleveland which is a 30 minute drive for me. If the food quality isn't improved I don't see how this place will last long term."}
{"text":"More Walnuts please on the Honey Walnut Shrimp!  Awesome service and convenient for me, since they are near where I live. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Zero stars. Couldn't get any food after my 27 hour ambulance shift because these clowns wanted to close down 15 minutes early. Called to let them know that I could see the cook laughing at me when I walked back to my car after being greeted by locked doors when I went to go get some food. The girl who answered was mouthy and disrespectful when I informed her that they locked up early and that I would be contacting their management during regular business hours. Shame on this staff."}
{"text":"One star because the last four times, yes we gave them four chances, we had to wait 25 minutes for food to be cooked. They are always out of things. We usually order online and allow another 15 minutes before going to pick up and still have to wait 20 more minutes. Why have online orders for convenience. When we finally get our food it is cold. We have visited other Panda's and never have this problem."}
{"text":"I do love panda, depending on the location. This location though, the first few times I went it wasn't too bad, but this time there was a worker named Elizabeth, that was absolutely rude as hell! She absolutely refused to sell me what I wanted, which EVERYWHERE else I go has no problem doing. Instead of getting the chow mein in a carton I asked for it in a foam container which she refused! This person needs an attitude adjustment as well as a new job working with toilets since she has a crappy attitude! Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Got my order wrong and had to remake the whole plate. Did the survey to get a free small side and took 20 minutes before I left because they were so busy and forgot about me. Worst location for Panda Express the costumer service is so poor."}
{"text":"Closest Panda express to my house (unfortunately). For some odd reason no matter what time of the day I come, the food is always dry. The orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp always look like they've been sitting there for days. I had to wait over 30 minutes for my meal because they only had like 3 shrimps and I needed 2 extra orders. Customer service could be better too. The girl who served me was laughing and talking to her cooks in Spanish after I ordered, which made it seem like they had a problem or were talking shit. Granted I was very nice and just asked for extra orders. I was the only person ordering at that time since it was like 830, so I didn't think asking for extra side orders of shrimp would be such a \"hassle\"."}
{"text":"Well a lot has seemed to have changed every one had hair nets ,the display of food was topped up looking fresh the staff were pleasent my server explained the combination very thoroughly as i stated very fresh and served hot ,proportions surfice for the price for one individual.The next time im going to panda express at Sams town casino and next time at Rancho im going to take picture."}
{"text":"They didn't have Chow Mein but they made it just for me. Not many varieties but gave us extra potions. Very nice people and definitely we will go back this location!!"}
{"text":"We decided to have a movie + Chinese food takeout date night, so we gave this panda a try. Food were fresh. The staff were friendly and offered us samples. Waiting time not too long. Nothing to complain.Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Panda Express is ever so consistent with their \"Asian food\". It's fast food, so you can't really be expecting gourmet quality Asian food! For a quick fix, this is great food for the value. Can get a little oily though.  Docked a few off the rating because of the customer service. It was extremely slow and they were not really friendly."}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service. Tammy helped, very poor attitude and very rude.  I asked my father if he was getting a bowl or plate; Tammy interrupted saying \"I already know\" with just an overall snobby attitude. When it was my turn to order i got \"what do you want\" and \"what else\" with that same attitude. She even added in a dramatic eye roll. I will never ever return to this or any other panda express. I'd rather spend my money at a more friendly establishment."}
{"text":"The employees are always friendly and move the line along. I have found no matter the time I come the food is always fresh and veggies crisp."}
{"text":"Long lines during peak hours. Their prices are a lot higher than your normal Panda Express due to the fact that it's on the strip inside a hotel. Overall cleanliness of this place is alright. Don't care for their service though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night,got dried out chow main,over cooked chicken egg rolls.called spoke to a employee she took my name so I could have my food replaced.great right? Nope.went back to get my food and  now the chow mian is burnt and to top it is it was the manager who gave it to me. Poor food I will not be back"}
{"text":"My visit today was occasioned by Panda's TV ad hawking delectable looking \"Chinese\" barbecued spare ribs. (limited time only)  Walking in, I was greeted by the same clean, bright interior I remembered from ten years ago, and ten years before that as well, in other cities. Same vibrant looking, Camera Ready grub previously prepared and ladled from deep tubs suitable for the hungry masses. My lone complaint about every Panda I've ever tried is that I find all their food grossly over sweetened, even when it should be savory.  Signs for the item I came for were prominently featured all over and around the first service area, but when I asked for \" just an order of ribs\" to go, the server hesitated and seemed confused. He recovered quickly though and asked which size I'd like of he three containers displayed. (ranging from tiny, to small, to a little larger) He packed the very small but meaty ribs tightly and said, apologetically, \"That will be $9.40, plus tax, is that okay?  I'd bet he's had some pushback over price vs. quantity and  it felt like he was offering me a graceful way to bail on the order if I wanted.  The visually compelling cashier acted as hesitant as the helpful server when totaling my snack-size order, but then leaned in to say in an undertone that I might consider ordering two entrees next time since that would include double ribs, which is what she said  I had in the middle size carton for my $10, and change. I'm not convinced that's exactly true, since I'm pretty sure the first server told the guest ahead of me that ribs w/ her entrée were + $1.25.   This particular time though, I didn't  feel at all that the cashier was upselling for later. She came across as actually meaning to point out a better value than what I ordered.  And, the ribs were exactly as imagined; sweeter than they should be, but tasty. Way overpriced too, at a buck a bite, but what you gonna do?"}
{"text":"Food was great and I love the new location. The young man in the drive thru was polite and had great customer service. My food was excellent I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express. I always order the orange chicken and it was great as usual. The manager helped us an due was great!! I know I will be back when I am on that side of town again."}
{"text":"My family went here to pick up dinner tonight the food was so bad the teriyaki sauce tasted like vinegar, the chow mein was mostly cabbage and the Batter on the walnut shrimp was mushy and way under fried. Also the broccoli in the beef and broccoli was yellow and brown. The workers were also very rude. We use to come to this panda a lot but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Service was good and place is clean. The line was fast. All food was there and making more in the back. This was also at lunch time when it's the busiest. Food tasted fine."}
{"text":"Shrunk your portions by shrinking your containers. You're not that good anyway. Not worth the price, won't be back"}
{"text":"When a business says they are open until 10pm, the doors should remain unlocked until 10pm. This location consistently closes 10-15 minutes early, and the employees never let customers in after they lock the doors.   Decent food, but very bad and unprofessional service from the young kids only there for a paycheck."}
{"text":"This panda needs to shape up!! One month ago we went in and the food was so over done it looked burned and the girl in charge was checking the temperatures on all the dishes and doing nothing about the fact that they were all over cooked and today I went through the drive thru and no teriyaki sauce for my teriyaki chicken, didn't even ask if I wanted it on the chicken or on the side, just didn't give me any."}
{"text":"great food!!! great service!!!  My boys always pick this Panda Express for their birthday lunch .  They know us by name."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru ever!  They are so slow.  Don't know how it takes so long..food is already prepared.  Owners should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"If you are hungry, this is an okay place to stop. The food isn't amazing but hey its pretty good and healthy for fast foodish food. It doesn't have the best food ever but its pretty good."}
{"text":"When you feature an item, it should be available at all times. I wanted the featured 8 Treasure chicken breast. The girl behind the counter told me it would be a 10 minute wait. The wait ended up being 28 minutes and I didn't even get the special with my other 2 entres. It looked nothing like the picture. Several tables around me were not getting what they ordered and one table had to wait on teriyaki sauce. really?  Had I looked at the reviews before walking in, I would not have eaten here."}
{"text":"I looked at the menu board.  It read 1 entree and 1 side for $5.99.  So I asked for orange chicken and a side of white rice.  \"$6.75 ok for you?\" the man behind the counter asked me.  \"The menu says $5.99,\" I replied.  \"Oh, okay,\" he said in a disappointed tone of voice.  (The menu board did say $6.75 for an entree and TWO sides, which is not what I ordered.  If the man had asked me if I wanted to upgrade to two sides that would have been one thing, but that's not what he did.  He was just trying to negotiate the price on a national chain menu and charge me more.)  Then the woman didn't give me a fortune cookie - and she received reluctant to give me one when I asked.  I don't know what in the world was going on with them, but my fortune cookie said I'm surrounded by silent love and friendship so it looks like I won out in the end."}
{"text":"We just bought food from here and when I got home and opened the box, there was a sour / spoiled smell. The fried rice smelled so bad. I called the store to inform them that the rice was no good. The lady I spoke to told me that it was not spoiled, and that the cook just put too much water! I am ASIAN!!!! Are you kidding me?!?!? We eat and cook rice on a daily, and having too much water makes the rice soggy and sticky, not sour smelling! I took the food back, and all they did was toss the rice from our boxes, transferred the meat into a different box, and gave us chow mein instead.. No apologies, but they did say have a great day!!! What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a good fan of Panda Express, but at this location in not going again, I order like always my regular rice  with teriyaki chicken n cream cheese, but this time, the chicken wasn't ready so they told me I had to wait n that was fine for me I wasn't on a hurry, but I guess they tough I didn't want to wait, by the time I started eating I find out my chicken wasn't good it was acceptable but far away from the regular quality I can expect from them, but to make worst my rice didn't had any trace of salt. I went to the counter n I let the lady know about my findings, but she tried n said \"you're right Sir. it's unsalted but that's the way it is.\" I definitely didn't expect that answer, my meal cost me around $8 n I was really hungry, so I didn't want the situation to escalate for that amount, but for sure my last visit to this location..."}
{"text":"When it comes to cheap, fast Chinese food, Panda is my place. But the service here sucks!!! This is now the third time that I have gone to this location in the last couple months where they have screwed up my order. I've been short-changed my sides of raggoons, not given any sauce, no cookies/napkins/forks, etc. Tonight was no different. Half a dozen cars in the parking lot and a couple in front of me in the drive thru and they changed the employee taking my order halfway through my 4 items. Wen they handed me my order they forgot the drink. Still not sauce for my raggoons. But in my small meal for one I was treated to 2 forks and 2 cookies tonight. I don't get it. With the demand for intelligent, professional workers in fast food these days, Panda sure seems to be behind the curve!!  Be warned if you buy here...check your food thoroughly before you drive away and make sure you received everything you ordered!"}
{"text":"Muy molesta!!! Fuimos a esta tienda mi esposo y yo como a las 9:30 pm y la comida estaba reseca, pedimos si nos podían hacer comida fresca y el cocinero no quiso, así también nosotros no queremos comer comida reseca y desagradable .... Recomendamos a nuestros amigos no ir allí pues tienen un muy mal servicio..."}
{"text":"Good food, fast, a lot of choice and been there a few times, closed to my hotel, counter server must be taking another training how to make better service for customer like greeting, smile, offered free sample"}
{"text":"Fresh and fast, good food and a lot of choice, been there a few times, counter server is great to take care our order"}
{"text":"I like this Panda Express because it is reliable.  That's the key, reliability.  The lines can be very long but I am one of those people (that add to that loooooong line).  I do not think parking is an issue because while it is hard to find a spot right in front of PE, you can sure park elsewhere in the parking complex and walk to it.  It is only a minute walk, and that is assuming you parked in front of Albertsons."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and speedy! Food is always great! I believe her name was Lindsey.. she was very professional, and her smile makes me want to go back for seconds, but im a little full. Lol. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a plate combo to go with Walnut Chicken. Was NOT informed of uncharge for the chicken. Was even more pissed when I got home to find 4 small pieces of chicken and was charged $1.25 for it."}
{"text":"This is one of the cleaner and friendlier Pandas I've been to, especially considering the neighborhood it's in, I would really recommend it. The manager Michael was very nice and I liked how he helped and assisted everyone accordingly. Five stars for this place."}
{"text":"Mmm beijing Beef! Came with the Family. Friendly service, food was fresh.   Grandma & both sons present favored the orange chicken."}
{"text":"I don't like this location as they ALWAYS serve less food than any other Panda express location. Just see for yourself the amount od chicken i have got for a bigger place. And on top of that, they have hortibly rude employees working here. I have to ALWAYS ask for fortune cookie or glass of water. They never give themselves. I won't go to this location again."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here once a week without fail, not because they were great, but because it was fast and easy to grab dinner here before I had to head to work. Now that they have made the ridiculous decision to stop serving pot stickers, we won't be coming here any longer, however. It was basically the last straw. They constantly burn my rice, give the smallest portions they can get away with, always had empty serving bowls around dinner time, and have crappy customer service. But no matter the quality of meal that day, they never messed up the pot stickers and I was always happy with them.  Maybe if you focused on improving the dishes that you already have instead of constantly coming up with new dishes to charge extra for, you'd be better off. I highly recommend bringing back pot stickers or losing a good deal of business."}
{"text":"Very small quantity for the price. Any other hakka Chinese places in the area will most likely beat this place in both value and taste. Food is never heated properly usually varies from warm to cold."}
{"text":"Went into lunch with my girlfriend on a Saturday afternoon. It seemed that the lunch rush had already passed through because there was no line to order. When we walked up the counter we weren't greeted and the girl who was helping us,\"Mariela\" was very rude. One of her coworkers was switching out some of the food and she even giggled at Mariela being so rude towards us. I work in the food service industry so I'm fully aware how it can get old working with so many people on a daily basis but you are never to be rude to them. We were friendly to her but got no reciprocation. When she asked if we wanted drinks,we said yes but then she apparently ignored us because she rang us up without them. So when we asked if she had included them,she got very pissy and seemed like we were an inconvenience to her. I asked for soy sauce and did not get a response at all. When my girlfriend asked for extra teriyaki sauce,she pointed at a bin with some portioned ones on her side of the counter and told him that he could grant hem for himself. The food wasn't even very good and we love Panda Express food normally. Planning on calling a manager to talk to her about the awful employees for sure."}
{"text":"Ehh food but had Mexican music playing at a Chinese fast food place.. Just wrong in my opinion"}
{"text":"I love the walnut shrimp! The environment is very clean and the staff are very friendly! I'm very impressed and super happy!"}
{"text":"OK...I just can't do it any more...no matter my craving for fast Chinese food. This food is just not good. It's flavorless, especially the fried rice and noodles, and for the most part dry. I mean the food has been sitting in containers for a while and it will dry out. (I know they change the food, but it till has to sit in those containers.) I've never been a fan of this buffet style of food where the food is kept in warmers and this is the reason why I'm not a big fan of buffets. I prefer my food cooked to order and fresh. Also, I've had delicious Chinese food in my life, and I just don't wan to settle any more. So I have given up on Panda Express. No more!"}
{"text":"One star just for this location and just for customer service.   I've been a customer of Panda Express for many years in CA and now NV.   I recently moved here and was happy to find this location so close to home.  Easy in and out after work.   Love their food.  This location doesn't disappoint.  What DID make me want to never come back here was this: I ordered the food, but  had to wait for the chicken.  No biggie.  I step up to the cashier and he tells me the total, I pull out my debit card, he looks at it, pauses... then says \"ummm..can I see your ID\"?  Sure no problem, I show ID.   Purchase was less than $20 but I have no problem showing my id.   My issue lays in the fact that NO ONE else was asked to show their ID after me.  As I stood there waiting I noticed that he didn't ask another person to show ID.  So.... why me?  And before you think I'm going all race card on you, it's the other way around here.   I got a taste of what it's like to be a minority.  I felt really bad.  And upset.  Why me?  What was it about MY appearance that made him question my integrity?   I would like to know!   Does Panda Express give their employees discretion on whom to ask and whom to trust?   I think there should be a corporate policy somewhere that says simply \"anything over $ ask, anything under $ don't bother\".   I think \"Hai W\" needs some additional training before he insults all your customers.   I will not set foot in this location again because of him."}
{"text":"Bad business practices. This place is a rip off. They charged my card then told that the food was going to take 10 min. As we were in a hurry asked for our money back. They refused so we called the police. Police were able to get our refund. Never will go back to this place again."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is their teriyaki chicken. Juicy chicken with an excellent sauce. Customers love this place as it always has people dining in but not too crowded.  Staff works very hard to please the customer, as it is one of the highest rated Panda Express locations in town."}
{"text":"They should put on the menu \"If it's not chicken it will cost over a dollar extra\" first time I came here I actually reversed out of the drive thru. I asked for a two item and everything that I wanted was almost 4 dollars more. the lady acted so rude when I asked for steamed rice, I heard her groan over the speaker. when I was done ordering she kept asking \"And what else?\" I had no idea what she was talking about. and said that I just ordered ONE two item. that just flew over her head and for some reason in her headset it came thru to me wanting two two items? I tried twice trying to explain to her that I was done with my order and that was it. she could not compute. poor thing blew a fuse and kept trying to get me to order more and pay more. I told her to just forget about the whole thing and reversed out of the drive thru. went one block more and found a Boston Market. will not be going there again"}
{"text":"Food is yum however at this location the sun shines through the windows right into your eyes! There's no where to sit exempt from this. Come to this location after sundown :)"}
{"text":"Today I had the chow main and orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp the wife had white rice orange chicken and Beijing beef service was good like always"}
{"text":"So my wife and I tried the drive-thru for the very 1st time and found it to be a bit confusing.  Not so sure that we will do that again?    Other than that, as usual the food is always good."}
{"text":"I recently ordered from Uber eats just like regularly do with this panda location. But today their orange chicken was so bitter that I legit have to spit it out."}
{"text":"Went for dinner ordered a three entrée with one side and a two entrée one side.dined in. Alexis was the server. Alexis screwed up on the three entrée one side plate, by adding food and take food off the plate that was not even part of the order and continued to dump the food back into the line in front of customers. She also used the same containers. She was rude and had attitude with me because I corrected what the plate was supposed to have on it. she did not offer sauces nor drinks and gave attitude when we asked who the manager was because our order had to be corrected three times and still was wrong. The manager after hearing what just happened replied with Alexis is untrained and unexperienced with the restaurant. While eating our dinner we noticed Alexis snapping photos of herself  instead of cleaning up the restaurant. The floors,walls,tables, chairs, condiments all sticky and trash was overfilling on the floor. Instead of getting trained Alexis played around got herself a drink went to the bathroom, didn't wash her hands and served another customer. This is unbelievable and unprofessional will not be returning also plan out disgusting."}
{"text":"Okay no big deal here this is mall food. A bunch of high school kids working  here not caring much about nothing. Not much  value for you money. If you never had Asian food in your life this could be a good start."}
{"text":"I had the Peking pork. It was very good. I used the drive thru. Service was quick. Will return."}
{"text":"Went drive thru & it was moving quickly, I was offered a sample which I never received! The food was just like any other Panda Express \"good\". My Pet peeve about this location is every single time I order & get served they are so greedy to fill my plate they skimp it out every single time & have witnessed a couple times they even take some food off the plate when serving, that is so annoying! Especially when I pay extra for a premium item like walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"Standard food, customer services was alright, but server seems like they don't know what they were doing, I had two plates and one of them fogot my crab rangoon, and charge me of it and also charge as five flavor shrimps which is higher price. I have to call them and go back again to get my food also the difference of the overcharged."}
{"text":"SLOW slow slow slow slow! I'm going to have to give up my Panda Express addiction because both Panda locations in Surprise suck."}
{"text":"Out of food EVERY TIME I come here! ALWAYS have to wait. You would think the employees know the best selling dishes by now and have them ready...sadly, no. When I have the nerve to ask how long, the employees are rude. Forget this place. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Food was trash. Dry, flavorless, old. It's so overpriced I felt so ripped off. I took one bite and couldn't eat anymore because it was so bad. The walnut shrimp tasted old, the noodles were dry and tasted old, and even the rangoons were hard as rocks."}
{"text":"Panda has a drive-thru? Maybe it's all the memories of Panda Express in the food court, but the drive-thru surprised me.  It was, however, a pleasant surprise as I was looking for some quick (but not \"fast\") food to take home, and wanted to be seen by as few people as I could in my sweaty workout attire.  The nature of this kind of restaurant doesn't lend to as speedy of a drive-thru experience as your typical fast-food chains, but in this case it was worth it to avoid getting out of the car.  Points for enabling the lazy.  The food is pretty standard from Panda to Panda.  Contrary to popular belief there is actually no panda meat in the food, but chicken, beef, shrimp, and plenty of veggies.  The orange chicken is mine and America's favorite dish, but I also love the beef and broccoli.  I think there's more room for error with beef than with chicken, though, when it comes to anything made in bulk.  I choose half noodles/half fried rice, which is the best of both worlds.  All that for right around $7 puts it a little pricey for the average lunch, but not bad if you consider the alternative was probably a Big Mac.  This location appears to be conveniently located at the intersection of Ray and the 101, but is awkward to get out of, due to the no-left-turns onto Ray.  To get back to the 101 you have to go all the way around the shopping center.  If I wasn't planning to turn right, I probably wouldn't do it at all and even that was a winding road."}
{"text":"Service is terrible the manager is not only mean but doesn't care if your food is gross."}
{"text":"The food is definitely prepared well and tastes fresh and spicy enough to hit the spot, However a bit pricey and portions are quite small. The location is very clean and service was good."}
{"text":"I don't remember one time I am here in chandler and not stoping at panda.  Love it lol. It's great. Food is good. Service is great.  Never to busy.  I love that place"}
{"text":"I have only been to Panda Express once before and had a bad experience at a different location. I needed something quick for lunch and decided to give it another try. The guy who helped me, Nathaniel, was extremely kind and had great customer service skills. I don't like when I walk into a place and the people are miserable. He greeted me when I first walked in and it was just a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Great option when you're in the mood for some asian fast food.  The place is very clean and well lit.  Service is fast and efficient.  The food is pretty good and never seems 'old'.  I've even been here an hour before closing and the food is still really tasty!  And they'll make it fresh if they've run out of something.  All in all, great asian fast food that you can get really fast!  Oh, and they're open till 10pm."}
{"text":"Never been to a Panda Express. Never have to go back. Not sure if it's the American Chinese that's wrong. But, We didn't enjoy it. Too cold. Air down too low. Food was cold immediately. Had no soy sauce. Guess It's the American Chinese thing. Thought it was pricey. A bowl, one side one entree is almost six bucks. Serving size for entree was small. Servers did not wear gloves. You can sample. Staff seemed ok. All young people. Most entrees almost empty. Maybe because didn't want to cook too much. Still a relatively new location. The gen tso chick is new. Should take it off the menu or rethink it. Very small piece of chick. Lots of coating. Fried very very very crispy. Husband could not chew his. Fried rice needed soy sauce. Of course they had none. Chow mein noodles were like none I had ever had. Not sure what they were. The chick n mushrooms were 20% chick. 80% mushrooms. Tried it. Would not go back. Maybe it's just me. But since we love Chinese food, thought we would enjoy it. We did not."}
{"text":"Servers was rude and snotty; she rudely corrected the customer behind me when she called an item by the incorrect name and muttered other insults under breath thinking no one could hear. She was the only employee serving and cashiering and there was only one cook at 11:30 for the lunch rush? Some other employee spent her time walking back and forth ignoring the cook, the server and the line of customers. Skip this joint altogether! There is a Pei Wei at Grayhawk and another Panda at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! Waited 25 minutes just to order (2 groups in line ahead of me when I got there) and they were out of almost everything. Told I could wait another 10 minutes if i wanted to wait for the stuff they were out of. No thanks. Don't really want to wait 35 minutes for fast food.   Had one person serving all customers in the restaurant who couldn't move any slower if he tried.  Maybe he had OD'd on too much MSG."}
{"text":"Hard under cooked rice , all BROCCOLI no bEEF not a little NO BEEF. everyone was disappointed and talked about it for an hour. Every thing was under cooked tasted like they just took the food out of a freezer put in a pan for 30 seconds and boxed it up.  Worst ever go across the street to red dragon for decent food."}
{"text":"I have come to this location for years. Tonight was the last time.  I honestly hate writing bad reviews...but this is just not right. For the price, you should expect decent quality food.  That is not what you get.  Regardless of it being \"fast food,\" this could very well be a health hazard and the staff should ensure that this doesn't happen. The food at this location is never fresh, but the staff isn't rude. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"my daughter loves Panda Express so I go here all the time since I just live like 2 mins away! their beef broccoli is very good unlike the other locations, theirs is always new and fresh.. flavorful! tea bar is a bonus coz I love boba! the staff are all nice esp Kay! they always offer me free drinks while waiting for a new and freshly cooked entree. when the food is getting low or not fresh anymore just ask them to make it fresh and they will make it for u in under 5 mins! with the free drink! can't beat that. always busy so that's not good sometimes when ur in a hurry but it just shows that it's good food and good location!"}
{"text":"What can I say, this is Panda Express.  So, not \"great\" chinese food, but pretty good for fast food...  I'm obsessed with the orange chicken (who isn't?) and the chow mein.  This particular location is the cleanest Panda I have ever been to... and they have a decent outdoor patio too.  Nice to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was really hungry and was TOTALLY DISGUSTED with the 12 inch (or longer) hair that showed up in my orange chicken. PUKE!! Manger offered to \"replace meal\" NO WAY!! Learn the basic code of food handling first and nake your staff cover their melons for starters, 'BOSS'"}
{"text":"Honey who works here is AMAZING! She went out of her way to make sure my baby had his own little plate and to follow up with us on how our food was!"}
{"text":"It took over 40 minutes to pick up dinner via the drive thru! We are extremely disappointed with the customer service (or rather, lack of) that was received Friday night (November 17, 2017) and will not be back.   We went through the drive thru and waited about 10 minutes before even reaching the speaker to order. I thought it was odd it was taking so long, so I started watching the clock. When we finally pulled up to order, we were told to wait. The employee on the mic didn't mute themselves on the drive thru and kept talking to others, it was very difficult to know when they were talking to me versus someone else. That's fine, I chalked it up to them probably being new and learning how everything works. That took around 5 minutes to finally place my simple 2 meal order. The next part is what really got me though: it took an additional 30+ minutes from placing my order to reaching the window.  I've never experienced anything like this - if it wasn't for the fact their drive thru had curbs I would have just pulled out and left. Here's the kicker, by the time I reached the window to pay, there were 3 associates by it and not one acknowledged me. We sat there waiting for 5 minutes (yes, again, you read that correctly) without anyone saying something to us. All it takes is a simple \"I apologize for the long wait, we will be right with you.\" That's it! But instead the 3 associates hovering at the window couldn't even open the window and offer a simple apology, let alone acknowledge me waiting to pay and pick up my food.   We will not be returning to this location. They've had issues in the past with the drive thru wait times and the order sometimes missing items. I kept hoping it would get better, but this was the final straw."}
{"text":"Went President's Day, wanted a quick lunch after watching a movie.  As soon as I started looking at the food, a gentleman asked if I'd like any samples. I refused at first, went back to my table to ask my kids if they'd like a sample, they were already both set on getting their favorite item here, the orange chicken. I went back and as I went further down the food, I did want a sample of the black pepper chicken ... and guess what, I ordered it! If it wasn't for the sample, I would've stuck with my usual, mushroom chicken."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service at this store today. Not only did they not have the dish I normally get not made at all (not even and empty bowl) they said they would make it and bring it out to me. They never did. Even though we paid for it. When I asked for it to be compensated they gave me some card that limited me to their 4 options of dishes. Not even the dish I ordered. Then I asked for a comp for full meal and was not provided one."}
{"text":"This panda is very close to my house therefore usually the only one I go to unless I'm in a different area. The customer service here isn't great. There are one or two friendly employees but some just seem miserable and confused.  I do not eat meat, so when I order from panda I simply ask for some white rice and chow mein. EVERY time I order they try to get me to choose some meat to go along with it after I tell them right away that those two things are all I want. Usually this doesn't bother me but the fact that it happens 1-2 times each visit by different employees is really getting annoying. Other than that they seem to handle the rush's okay.  Food is usually good although sometimes you can tell things have been sitting out way too long and shouldn't be served. I've gotten hard rice on a few occasions. Oh well."}
{"text":"Before I start my review I have to say that I ate at a Panda Express in Las Vegas 2 months ago and it was very good. I liked it enough to go back a second time during my stay.  As for the Mentor restaurant, it was very disappointing. I decided to try this place on Friday, 9/2/16 about 6;30 on the opening week. The line was out the door and we had to wait about 25 minutes to get to the counter. ( Not a problem and understandable when a new place opens in Mentor) But that was the only thing I didn't mind.   I ordered the two entree plate of Shanghai Beef, Tso Chicken, and fried rice and spring rolls. I have to say it all looked good and that was the only good thing that I say about the food.  My wife ordered the same beef, orange chicken and vegetables.  After paying we immediately sat down to eat. I tried a fork full of fried rice...no flavor and cold. Next I ate a piece of beef, tasty but almost cold. Next I tried the spring roll, COLD again. So I grab my plastic knife and try to cut a piece of the Tso chicken which was a little warm, not hot by any means and couldn't cut the piece in half. It was like a rock and so over-fried that it was impossible to eat. I didn't want to complain about the food to my wife so I asked her how hers was. She said everything was cold and got that funny look on her face like not good.  So she ate about half her food and I ate less than that and threw the rest in the trash. I'm not trying to bash this place but I would expect when you open your doors for business that your food is hot and fresh because you don't get a second shot at a first impression. Take my review for what it's worth. But I have never gotten cold Chinese food from any Chinese restaurant ever! This was a first."}
{"text":"After waiting over 13 minutes in the drive-through, I convinced the three cars behind me that there was going to be an insufferable wait.  We all backed out and left.  This is not the first time I have had my time wasted at this location, but it is the LAST!  It is managed and operated by a team of  retards (I can't _prove_ that, but it's my opinion).  Citizens of Peoria: Please join me in boycotting this restaurant and put this location out of business!  By contrast, I was in and out of Jimmy John's across the street in less than 2 minutes.  I don't write many 1-star reviews, but this experience demanded one."}
{"text":"Average food and service. This review is solely for the drive thru as I've never been inside. Whenever I've gone here, I never really had to wait in line. Service is pretty quick and you get your food pretty fast. This is something that is expected from a fast food restaurant. It to avoid going in the night time thought because the food served are usually pretty hard and chewy as I'm sure that they have been sitting in the pan all day. I'm normally a big fan of orange chicken but not the one that panda express serves. I think that the smell is too powerful. I do however love their shrink based foods such as the walnut shrimp and the new five flavor shrimp. I just wished that they're a little cheaper. The shrimp are usually pretty soft and its full of flavor. If you are craving fast Chinese food, don't expect anything fancy or anything that will make you go, \"wow\" from this fast food restaurant. It will satisfy your Chinese cravings though."}
{"text":"This is insanely overpriced for a tiny amount of food that doesn't even taste like what it's supposed to. The orange chicken is bad and the steamed veggies are soggy and somehow have burnt pieces scattered through. Could have spent 5 more dollars and gotten two huge burritos from Chipotle and been full all day, instead of spending 13 dollars for \"two\" servings that some places wouldn't even consider one. Will absolutely not be returning."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Arrowhead location and the food is amazing and fresh. I ended up going to this location for the first time and was very disappointed. The food wasn't fresh and seemed as if it had been sitting there for awhile. The teriyaki sauce had even gotten thick! There was only one person in the whole kitchen and there was nobody cooking fresh stuff. To me it seemed as if they aren't throwing their old stuff out. I'm a manager at a place where we sell buffet and we have to set timers to ensure that the food isn't just sitting there when it's slow. The lady helping me out wasn't too friendly either. Overall, very disgusting and old food. I'm gonna stick with the Arrowhead location!!"}
{"text":"Friendly employees! Went around 7pm for dinner. No complaints! I really don't expect much for fast food places, these kind of jobs are not the greatest, constantly dealing with \"hangry\" people. This is fast food guys! It you want 5 star service dish up more money for a 5 star restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was not pleased with my first experience. I attempted to order a plate that consist of 2 entrees and a side. Instead of choosing 2 different entrees I wanted the same entree 2x. Easy enough. They wanted to charge me 1.25 per entree plus the cost of the entree. I expressed how that didn't make since because you get 2 entrees with the plate. And the associate said \"I don't know that's just how it is.\" It didn't make sense so I left and went to Pacific Grill and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"The drive-thru wait times are extreme.  If they are waiting for something to be cooked, they don't tell you to pull ahead so others can go through.  In fact, they don't tell you ANYthing; you just get to sit and wonder what in the world is happening.  Also, if you get shorted something from your order and call the number on the receipt, you'd sure better hang on to that receipt WITH THE NAME of the manager on duty. When he says he's going to write your name down in a book that says what you were shorted, he WON'T.  I've been rooked twice now."}
{"text":"Panda Express is always good, but this place LOADS IT UP! Every time I go, with different employees, I get a full bowl. Most locations are very careful with their portions, but I have never seen so much food in my Panda Bowl. I love this place."}
{"text":"It took my wife's plate 10 min for to get and mine was getting cold meanwhile I waited for hers cold food bad csr don't pick this place to eat"}
{"text":"Good but I expected better.  I won't mention the rotten avocado half sitting on what would've been my table.  An employee didn't seem to mind it much tho.  He sat at that table for his meal.  The food was good, the environment was not and their customer service is lacking."}
{"text":"For a quick fix, Panda always delivers. Unfortunately this location doesn't have a drive-thru so It can be a pain if you're on the move. Regardless, the food is always good and they have a variety of things to try so I don't have any serious complaints."}
{"text":"Very good food fast even at lunchtime. Good selection of meats, veggies, egg told and wontons. Food  cooked fresh.  Healthy relatively. Ritter than a burger. Reasonably priced with tasty iced tea. A great lunch alternative to the usual fast good."}
{"text":"Great location and staff! They were fast and even offered to make me and my husband fresh crispy shrimp without us even asking! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and hot. I waited while they cooked it. Because of that I didn't mind waiting in a parking space. When it was ready, it was delivered to my car. I really like the convenience of the drive thru."}
{"text":"I usually go in to get my food.  Today I went drive-thru.  Now, I guess I can see why he line took forever, for \"fast food\"; though, my order was wrong, on the ticket and what they gave me wasn't what they had on the ticket or what I said and was on the screen.   This location is 5 stars, easy, IF you go in.  As well, with drive thru vs take out, they skimp on the portions, severely."}
{"text":"I've never reviewed a one star on Yelp. Unfortunately, this is my first one. This Panda Express shouldn't be a $ fast food store. The food I tried is so expensive, more expensive than Paris, judging by the quantity, and does not taste good at all. A bowl of Honey Walnut shrimp without walnut has only 6 tiny fried shrimps, see my posted picture. The fried rice (so small portion) tastes plain. It costs $8.16, way too much. If it is only this Panda Express store then the store quality control is poor. If it is across the board for all Panda Express stores then I will never go to any Panda Express."}
{"text":"This was a late night craving for Panda. They were \"open\" but with very limited items to choose from. If a place is open, they should operate at full capacity of their normal pickings.  On the plus side, they did give extra servings because of their selection being so limited. Will give them another try during the day sometime."}
{"text":"I ordered through the drive thru, I asked for four sides of sweet and sour and two sides of teriyaki, she read back the order right when I paid and I had to wait 6 minutes for teriyaki sauce. I pulled up front but I ended up waiting 15 minutes and then our food was cold, I ordered a bowl and there was barely any rice and very little meat. I did not pay $16.00 to be compensated for cold food and then I got four teriyaki and 2 sweet and sour and a long wait. I am very disappointed and unhappy. Seriously why do I even bother ?"}
{"text":"Ordered orange chicken n bejing beef.  There were almost empty on bejing beef tray and i didnt want to get small portion of left over.   I asked for the bejng beef and the cashier \"stacygail\" (not sure her name. Found her name on the receipt n she was an asian) kindly informed me it took 5 mins. Usually they gave small portion of left over to customer and acually other cashier gave that portion to next person. She gave me generous portion of food  except bejin beef because other black cashier put it on my container."}
{"text":"I did pick up order and it was not ready when i got here. There were three employees and two of them were using cell phones.   I asked my order and then she just started  put the food into the box with wrong items.  I ordered two differnt kinds of rice but she put one rice. So i asked her to change it. After that she put the wrong main items again.   It was not busy at all and there were three employees. Dont know what should i say~"}
{"text":"Its ok.  Its definitely what people say - Americanized Chinese food.   I love Chinese food.  I didn't love this.  Now, I didn't hate it either.  Its ok.   Its just like Enso or Piada in the way you order your food.   Pick a portion, pick a side, pick an entree, pay and go.  I got a plate and tried the orange chicken, which they call their signature dish, and the mushroom chicken with fried rice.    The orange chicken is advertised as sweet & spicy, but there was very little spice in mine.  The mushroom chicken was too salty, or even gravy-like for me.  Again, it wasn't awful, it just wasn't to my liking.   The fried rice was fine, and they give you A LOT.   The worst part of the meal were the spring rolls.  They were pretty bad.   Its quite a bit of food for the price, so that's good.     If it was out of my way I'm not sure I'd go back, but since its right up the street I'll give it another shot and try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"Reached out to corporate. They sent me a coupon. Wait is still ridiculously long."}
{"text":"Came in to get fried rice to go. Was told the fried rice was hard. It was a half an hour before closing time and they had already closed the kitchen. Won't be coming back for this one. The girl in front of me was trying to get fried rice too and asked if someone could make a new batch. The girls at the front said it was not an option."}
{"text":"Went here a few times just to see if I hit it on a bad day...well...I guess it was as good as it could get for them.  The white rice was dry and undercooked.  The portions are small and over priced.  If my husband was to eat here he would have to order twice as much and still wouldn't get the same amount of food as a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time dining here in this branch. I love Panda Express coz it is affordable and most of what have ordered were all delicious. My favorites are the five-flavor shrimp, orange chicken and chicken teriyaki. The only thing I don't appreciate in this branch is their RICE. It tasted like instant rice or uncooked rice. I am not sure if they really cook the rice here or they use the instant one. Could have been better if rice was also good coz it will make the food experience really better."}
{"text":"This Panda needs updated reviews!  The staff was nice and polite with fast service and a smile at the cash register. The food all looked so good it was hard to decide on entrees. My order was very good and good portions too. I'm sure this is a busy location and they serve a lot of people at rush times. Panda is good food freshly prepared, so at some point you might have to wait a few minutes for some thing that was popular that day and the 30 people that came in ahead of you all ordered. People just need to be reasonable."}
{"text":"Disregard the old reviews, they should be deleted as they are obsolete. This Panda location is a very good one. The food is excellent! The food is fresh and looks so good it's hard to decide which entree to order. They give you nice sized portions (a lot) so I can imagine if there's 8 - 10 people in font of you they can decimate a tray of Shanghai Steak pretty quick! When I've been there they always have a fresh tray to replace what's getting low. You can't beat this place for freshly prepared food that tastes great. The staff are an excellent group, friendly and helpful. This is my go to location for Panda."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever experienced. An employee named Blessen reacted with eye rolling and giggling when we told her our string bean chicken was cold. We called the manager over and Blessen proceeded to continue being rude and inconsiderate. While we were letting the manager know what happened, she kept interrupting and saying \"bye-bye\". The manager did nothing. She should've been fired on the spot. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Worst panda location... Staff is rude and don't care. If we are running around and out we will stop at panda before going home around 8pm. Yes they close at 9pm but they don't care. They refuse to make fresh food-- they literally tell you you can only eat what's out. It's ridiculous. If the place isn't closed they should still be serving and making food. This has happened to us and are family members on different occasions. So they must tell this to everyone. We have stopped going, but really think they should fix this if they want to stay open."}
{"text":"the queue was very long at lunch hours, so don't come in the lunch hours. But the food was so good, the service was so fast, and the portion was big too! I can spend $10 and ate only the half of it, then pack the rest to eat again for the next meal."}
{"text":"It's ok. I have only used the drive thru. I didn't check the order before leaving and they forgot one of my items that I also paid $1.25 up charge for which i consider to be partially my fault. Should always look. The food was lukewarm which I was surprised about in the middle of the lunch rush. Everything tasted fine. The cashier was friendly and the parking lot was well maintained. I would give it another try sometime if I was looking to pick up something quick and not have to get out of the car."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! The rice tasted like wallpaper paste.  The 2 dishes I had just weren't good and it cost a ridiculous $9.40.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place is the worst ! They have young kids that are always rude . If you go after 8 they stop making certain items.  It's always dirty and their food has went down hill it's really poorly made."}
{"text":"The store is close at 9:30 and I arrived there like 8:30, the told me they don't have fried rice and no kongpao chicken because they are about to close?! And I have waited for orange chicken for 10 minute when I got home, they only give my 2 piece of Shanghai steak and 4 piece of chili shrimp. This is so ridiculous, if you don't want to run the place then don't . You guys are disgusting. I will never come to this place again!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped on the way home to get dinner for the family.the 28.00 /3 people. The order was filled with fatty chicken that was colored but not seasoned. Beef and Broccoli not much better.everyone in house sick within 35 minutes only able note to write review. Will do being lazy and walk into Teriyaki Madness next time. Flash its Friday night no work in the morning our I'd be in a pickle."}
{"text":"The food is good if you like panda express but the highlight of this location it's the drive-thru.  It is convenient for those times when you want to pick up to-go without getting out of your pajamas.    An added bonus is that this location is busy so the food is always fresh.  Good employees and a recent remodel make for a good store overall."}
{"text":"Pauline needs to learn guest service. She doesn't say hello or make you feel like a guest at all. The restaurant was dirty and a lot of pans were empty. I don't see any management on he floor as probably why it is looking and running that way   Not coming back to this location anymore"}
{"text":"This place is not just like any normal Panda Express because we are the first to have our very own Panda Express Tea Bar! We have teas ranging from Oolong up to our most popular Mango Freeze! You can also get drinks either hot or cold.. Or for those who love Boba you can add them on as well!! When is drinking boba ever a wrong thing?!?!! Plus enjoying it with the world famous orange chicken?!?!  So come by and say hello to the new and exciting things we have at this new store!"}
{"text":"The manager Philippe is very professional. He knows what he is doing keeping the store clean and food looking fresh"}
{"text":"Waiting in line (drive thru)  30 minutes, they got my order wrong, and the food i ordered frozen cold. Never returning again. Bad bad bad service!!"}
{"text":"Bad Chinese food is my guilty pleasure. This location is alway clean and deliver my online orders on-time.  What's not to love about bad chinese food?"}
{"text":"Most times I see a Panda Express and think \"maybe it will be a good experience this time\" this was one time where they got it right. Shawn hooked me up with a pretty decent size of chicken and provided a good attitude to go with it. Overall 8/8 gr8 panda m8."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in my mom stepped on a roach. The service we received was short and shorty. The associate kept leaning on the other side to talk to her coworkers. She didn't keep eye contact and was very unprofessional. The chow mein was missing sauce. It was simply just the noodles dry.....   The roach was still there by the time we left. This is unsatisfactory and disgusting. I wish no one has to experience this again.   Im assuming its bad luck considering I ALSO DID NOT GET MY FORTUNE COOKIES.....    Wow!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location puts waaaay too much cabbage onions and celery in the Lo Mein noodles. The iced tea is very good."}
{"text":"I love Panda...but I hate  his location. I waited 10 minutes in the drive threw. Finally when I got close enough for them to get my order I was told they couldn't hear me and to wait a little. So I waited, and waited, and no one ever came back on to get my order. So I waited a bit longer to drive on and park. I walk in, no chow mein (it would be a 30 minute wait) and no broccoli beef. Yeah that's not cool and as a fast food place you should always have food on hand."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times this year, and every time the food is over cooked, and tastes like its been sat there for hours. even at 7pm, when it should be busy.  The staff are nice and friendly, and the restaurant is clean, the location is ideal to where I live, but I just can't go there again, I will try the one on Rainbow next time.. I love Panda Express. but this store just disappoints every time."}
{"text":"Holy crap never again. I have given this place multiple chances but they can not preform to save Thier life. They say five minutes for spring rolls so I stood and waited 15 minuets my food is now cold and now my wife is almost done eating so no meal together. Which is weird cause I thought 3 or 4 people cooking ment speedy cooking let alone for frozen refried spring rolls. So run don't come here if u want a warm meal and good service."}
{"text":"Town square Panda Express.. This place is clean and that's all it has going for it. The food is soggy, they charge you a dollar more and give you less food than other locations. Save your stomachs and go else where."}
{"text":"The food is undoubtedly good for fast food Chinese, but they do this thing that gets me every time.  They have the menu designed in such a way that it LOOKS like your drink is included as part of it (1. Get Side 2. Pick two entrees 3. Get Drink) but they charge you extra for the drink, and Egg Roll is NOT a side, so they charge you extra for that.  Its better knowing all this, but it keeps me from raving about it.  I'm sure the prices here are more expensive because its in the Venetian too.   All in all, pretty decent, but there are a lot of choices near by that I probably enjoy better."}
{"text":"Panda is panda. Always busy, always good food. Having lived in Asia for over a year I can say it's a little shy of authentic Chinese food, but tastes great all the same. Fast, (usually), and inexpensive. Didn't give the fifth star because of ambience. But it's fast food. You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I could eat Panda every other day. I like it that much. Today I had the displeasure to try the one at Desert Ridge. We were ignored for a couple of minutes while 3 employee talked among themselves. The mixed vegetables were discolored, shriveled, and dry. We were told fresh were on the way. The beef with broccoli & orange chicken were room temperature at best. The chowmein was supposedly fresh but had some hard clumps like it had been reheated. The tables were about 20% accupied yet ALL of the others were too dirty to use. We had to ask for someone to clean a table for us. It took several minutes because they couldn't find THE cleaning cloth. They only had 1. I don't know if this is normal for this Panda but this is far below the standard for others I have visited."}
{"text":"Panda Express...nothing new. But this one gets a review because the service alone sucked! The food warrants a \"meh\". I was ignored and skipped at the beginning of the line, then screwed over at the end of it. Turns out, if you order any sort of shrimp entree, it's $1 extra. Is that posted anywhere? Nope! Orange chicken was kind of bland, the shrimp were good, and the egg rolls weren't so delicious?! After all the carbs, I was ready for a nap. Overall, not a good experience and won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The orange chicken wasn't fresh so they made more and apologized heavily for the wait. Also, employees came around to ask if we were okay, which is fantastic for a franchise like this! Will return."}
{"text":"The fried rice is bland...sorry!, but it is. All these places are like Chinese McDonald's.  I think the Ala cart should be broken down to the same $$$ amount instead of having to pay an inflated price for food you don't want!, ie chow main, and fried rice. I DON'T WANT ALL THAT CRAP!  It's just a filler to make you feel like your getting more, you really aren't they're give you that cause it's CHEEP for them or when really your getting stiffed in the healthy food portion.  ( Rice and noodles are carbohydrates = fat! )  Also every time I go there I only want 1 or 2 things Ala cart and  they get insistent on me getting there 2-3 meal entry, they say, \"it's a better deal.\" I alway say I don't like my food tasting like polystyrene and even though trees have to be chopped down to make the carton I like at least that the carton degrades faster and doesn't make my food taste funny."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Avoid this Panda location at all costs.  Very slow very unorganized.  Wait time was ridiculous 25 minutes waiting in line then to cook my food.  Avoid this place.  Everyone working there had an I don't give a shit attitude."}
{"text":"Yum! It was great customer service we received. This has got to be the only panda express with a giant logo! I already had panda express like a thousand times so it's nothing unique from my taste bud. (I used to work at panda) the food came out fresh and the place was really clean."}
{"text":"It is 105 degrees outside so we figured we'd sit inside to enjoy an afternoon snack. Unfortunately, it must be 95 degrees inside!!! Haven't these people heard of air conditioning??? This is just being cheap!!!  No wonder the employees are grumpy and don't know how to greet you or smile. As for the food - bland, chewy. Obviously been sitting for a while.   Won't waste any more money coming here. They have a prime location yet restaurant is empty. Chik-Fil-A across the parking lot is full. Guess I made the wrong choice today but won't repeat this mistake again.  Ps. One star is the lowest you can rate. Would be 0 if possible!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but they are incredibly understaffed and service is very slow. Wanted to get in and out quickly so I ordered online. It said it would take 15 minutes I ended up waiting 45 minutes no exaggeration. Probably not gonna come back to this location"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is its location inside the enclosed mall.  While eating my crappy lunch -- I'll get to that in a moment -- I was sitting in their 'cafe'.  The ceiling of the mall has a sky motif; suddenly I heard thunder, the sky turned a bit dark (remember, this is inside the mall) and it started to rain. Drops of water fell from the ceiling into a pool below.  It truly simulated a spring shower.  Cool.  But I came for the food.  And that was awful.  I ordered beef with broccoli.  To quote Clara Peller -- remember her? -- \"where's the beef?\"  I got over-priced broccoli, with a side of tasteless over-cooked noodles.  Unfortunately, some restauranteurs in touristy areas, don't care about client retention since their customer-base is transient. I hope reviews like this, spark the owners to upgrade their standards.  I for one, won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this Panda Express 3 times and the drive-thru always takes about 20 minutes to get through.  The food is pretty good, but the service is just SO slow.  With the long waits, you'd expect the staff to apologize for the inconvenience, but they barely even acknowledge you.  This place definitely needs to work out the kinks and come up with a better system to get customers in and out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The place was clean and we must have just missed a rush because although the restaurant wasn't packed we had to wait about 8 minutes for our entree. I'm actually ok with that. I like to know it hasn't been sitting out long. Luis was very professional and friendly. Food was as good as Panda can be."}
{"text":"I like Panda Express as a whole, but this location is particularly slow.  I have eaten at this location probably a dozen times in the past couple of years.  I decided to try the online ordering to see if it was any better.  Well, I got there right at the time my order was suppose to be ready.  The server told me that they forgot to \"drop\" the orange chicken and that it would be another five minutes or so.  She just laughed about it and walked off.  One of the cooks said \"look how busy we are\" and then just laughed.  It was busy as dinner time usually is, but no more than usual.  I find it frustrating because it just is so poorly run and the customer service is atrocious.  I don't do a ton of reviews, but my advice is that you better plan on spending a lot of time waiting and don't plan on reasonable service if you plan on eating here."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and really generous with the food! Clean and fresh! Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Rice wasn't cooked properly. Chicken was very good however.  Clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Service is pretty decent, which is why I can only give 4 stars.  Hopefully they improve their customer service and accept responsibility when they are wrong."}
{"text":"This location always seems to provide slow service especially in the drive thru so to avoid that nightmare i went inside. It was 20 minutes before closing and i felt rushed as a i ordered so i made things simple. One bowl of rice and orange chicken with 3 eggrolls, there was no customers before or after us to confuse the order with yet when i drove all the way home is when i realized there were no eggrolls whatsoever even though i had been charged...not even a fortune cookie. The service here needs to improve even a simple greeting would be nice. I couldnt call or go back to fix the mistake because the location had closed by then. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they would have 3 people helping one guy and the at least 7 customers waiting in line being ignored. Thanks for making the decision to ever eat here easy."}
{"text":"I stop in every now and then with the wife and kiddo and it's always the same; fast, friendly service, and the food is good. They give you a decent amount for a fair price, too. The restaurant is clean, and we never wait long. Definitely can't complain."}
{"text":"If you like waiting 10 minutes to order, never being able to get what you wanted, and getting inconsistent portions this is the place for you. The food it good but the service is just awful. I just walked out because they did not have rice of any kind. Will not return to this location"}
{"text":"WOW! Seriously some of the best service I've experienced since moving to Cleveland two years ago. Originally from southern California I've eaten panda express often and am use to the menu and style of the restaurant. When I moved to Ohio it was very hard to find a Chinese restaurant that gave me that same panda taste. So when I found out this location opened up I was ecstatic to visit. The food is amazing like I remembered but the quick popularity was unexpected. My first visit was great. Got in before the rush and was able to get in and out in under ten minutes. The second was with my boyfriend who was dying to find out what all the hype was about since panda was all I ever talk about when it came to Chinese food. But the line was long, about a 45 min wait and the servers were slow, probably due to their inexperience. They ran out of orange chicken for about 10 minutes which was a bit of an annoyance but since I was so excited to eat I didn't notice the wait time for the next batch. We were in there for about an hour. My third time was what really prompted me to write this review. I had just gotten off of work and was really craving panda so I headed straight there. It was a Sunday evening around 7:30 and the line was pretty long. This time it looked like over an hour wait. The servers were a bit slow again probably due to the lack of experience and the only one I saw cooking was a manager which I thought was strange given how busy it was. Well after standing in line for about 10 minutes a server approached me and asked to take my order by hand seeing how long the line was and I'm actually 38 weeks pregnant so I'd be able to sit down and wait for my order to come up. She even offered me a drink. I was so impressed and moved by her professionalism I had never received that kind of service. She had my order up in less than 10 minutes and I couldn't have been more grateful. This is the kind of service I'd expect from a high end restaurant  but for it to come from my favorite old panda was even more special. Thank you to the kind young lady that served me and best of luck to this new location. With time this will be Cleveland's best kept secret."}
{"text":"Useta eat here once in a while. Was below average, which surprised me since the area is a bunch of wanna be snobs. But last time I got food poisoning. Will not be goin back."}
{"text":"I think some people expect too much from a fast food joint. I have never encountered any problems with Panda Express. I have been going to Panda for almost 10 years. Great quality of food for a reasonable price. Consistency lacks on some items such as their egg rolls. It is not always fresh. Employees are friendly enough that they offer you to try some sample of their new items."}
{"text":"I liked the place. Their food was not tasteless or not too salty like some other panda expresses. I had the steak and orange chicken with fried rice. I usually don't finish all my food and I was pretty hungry, but it was fairly good and had no leftovers.  I must admit though, they do have a lot of customers. The line gets pretty long, but the service does not quicken, especially during peak hours when everyone wants to eat. The workers serving the food aren't rude. They just look like they all needed a break or something. If you come to get the chicken teriyaki and they're out of it, you will have to wait a LONG time. This guy was there waiting for it and we noticed him while ordering and even after we finished eating, he was still waiting for like 30+ minutes.  I, personally, didn't have a bad experience with the food or the wait, but it was very noticeable from what I saw with other people there."}
{"text":"I can see why they are 3 stars. The food is decent for the price but the the line server seemed to be a very disinterested employee. It was clear she was not happy at this particular moment. No greeting, no smile. The most disappointing part was when she got us Sweet and Sour sauce, she stood by her station and waited for us to walk back through the line, pass some customers to retrieve the sauce from her. Niambia E is the name of the server."}
{"text":"This is your average experience when talking about fast chinese food.  Although this particular place does usually have fresh food.     My biggest ding?  How they skimp out on the entrees.  Most times you have to tell your server, \"Umm can you give a lil more?\"  I'm a big fella, but seriously when I don't ask I'll get 3 pieces of beef and few broccoli if don't give a heads up.  Makes you ponder sometimes if they get the beef from the servers' family farms lol... that goes for any entree you get btw.  Aside from the lack of food this place ain't bad.  It's not good, but it's not bad.  Their best entree by far is their honey walnut shrimp so get that (4 of 5).     Oh yeahhhh, my other pet peeve why do they play traditional Chinese music for God's sake?  It's not like Taco Bell plays regional Mexican music... just saying..."}
{"text":"Second time coming to this one and they have sucked both times.. not only let you stand there but the food is hard and we ordered teriyaki chicken and never got it but we got the sauce. When we called to complain they did not care we ended up just throwing our food away at the end of the night.  I don't recommend it for anybody to go there they were truly horrible. I'm just saying..then they promised us some teriyaki chicken the next day told us to come back and get it but the rest of the food sucked too so I couldn't to eat more of the nasty and I  go back and couldn't refund or anything couldn't be done so just very disappointed in this specific Panda express not speaking on all panda express but this one truly sucks...."}
{"text":"They gave be such a small portion for $6. I was very disappointed. I got the orange chicken and chow mein. The noodles were dry and the chicken was just gross. I will not be coming back I'm sorry"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely horrible. Music is too loud, staff serving lacked communication skills and were completely disorganized. We stood in line forever, had our dinner plates left on the line and watched while 2 other customers went in front of us. It took 5 minutes to get anyone to bother to notice us and when I asked to be able to pay for our food while it was still warm, I was told to wait for a 3rd person to be allowed to cash out. We ended up walking out without purchasing.  Totally disappointed. Negative 5 Stars.."}
{"text":"Just ordered food for delivery, I'm working or else I would have picked it up! Foods cold and my chow main is chopped, as in like I ordered a chopped salad! Wtf!?"}
{"text":"Lady upfront was rude her name is Riz. Honestly not a good addition to the company .  , had no sense of humor , super tight up . Rice was bland . Disappointed, expected better"}
{"text":"When I first walked in I was greeted by Ana. She was very friendly and accommodating when I asked for a sample. Her service was prompt ( I was running on limited time during my break) and she was able to get me in and out in less than 5 minutes. I usually have a hard time remembering people's names but Ana was so sweet and friendly that I made sure to remember it so I could write this review. I also tried the 5 flavor shrimp for the first time and it was amazing! Chose that over my usual mushroom chicken. Overall a great experience and I'm glad I chose Panda Express for lunch. & on a side note, I made it back to work with 4 minutes to spare ;) Thanks Ana!"}
{"text":"Came in to pick up a pretty big take out order today, It was my first time at this location since they opened in the neighborhood.    I'll start by saying the food was really good.  Fresh and hot.  The service on the other hand, not so good.  They weren't very busy, there was no one at the counter when we walked in, but by the time our order was correct and in the containers, there was a line out the door.  We got a bunch of 2-3 entree meals and I had everything written down as far as fried rice, string bean chicken combinations etc......, but this seemed to cause confusion, mass confusion.  I think there were just too many people trying to work the line, and no leadership meaning everyone didn't have a designated job.    There was one girl in particular that felt that getting smart having an attitude and rolling her eyes would get all the customers pushed through the line quicker, but that didn't really work out for her.  I could go into greater detail but I'm sure you get the point.    Oh and by the way, to the petite Hispanic girl with the winged eyeliner, your not that cute.  I couldn't see you feet but if your wearing Jordan's, the \" any high school girl \" starter pack is complete!!"}
{"text":"Panda is always consistent and no complaints. Went through the drive through and the service was fast and friendly. Food was hit and fresh. Orange chicken is a must try if you've never been. Love their egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce as well."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have visited this location, I would love to say the food was great but I've never made it past the ridiculously slow service. The first two times I tried eating here the line was out the door, I assumed this was because this location just opened and was the first in the area but after this time I realized the service is really just that slow. When I got there, there were about 6 people in line ahead of me, after waiting close to 15 minutes there were 7 people in line in front of me because one of the people that were already served came back because part of his order was missing. I left after waiting 20 minutes without the line moving."}
{"text":"Laveen Panda Express is Horrible! The Service , The food and especially the employees. Not one time have I ever gone and received my order in a timely manner. The employees treat customers so rude. The walk around like they hate everyone. I highly would NOT recommend this panda express location."}
{"text":"I came to this location this afternoon for lunch. I was very impressed with my service, customer service was awesome by all team members. Very clean restaurant. And great tasting food. Keep up the great work !"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Panda Express in Robinson Township. Beautiful on the outside and nice on the inside. I've been through the drive-thru a couple of times and decided to go in for my first time. As soon as I went in, there were 2 young girls in front of me in line. When it came to my turn to be served the girl taking the orders refused to work any more and said \"I'm tired\" and refused to serve anyone else. The manager immediately took over and I placed my order. It was very rushed and she didnt give me any time to look at what they had, so I just went with the orange chicken and side. The following employees attitudes were exactly the same...not very good customer service. It was a very bad first impression....NOT ONLY THAT.....I get home and what do you know, a disgusting black hair mixed in with the food. I immediately stopped eating and spit out the rest. I am so grossed out and disgusted. The place is gorgeous, but these employees could care less. Its only been open for a few months. Such a disappointment and just grossed me out.   1/25/18 - No messenger on yelp is enabled to get in contact with Derek T. from this location."}
{"text":"Came in to get dinner.  No food available they were training a new cook. Staff walks out no manager on site.  Person who was supposed to be in charge loses it.  Thanks Abagail for holding it together.  I won't be back for awhile!"}
{"text":"Had the worst customer experience this evening in the drive thru. To start, they don't have two of the items I asked for: chow mein and grilled chicken. When I asked why they don't have it, they told me the grill is broken and that I would have to wait for them to make a batch of chow mein.  I asked how I could be compensated for my inconvenience and was told there is nothing they could do. When I got to the drive thru window I asked to speak with the manager and was shocked to hear that there was no manager on shift. I asked to speak with whomever was in charge and the girl blankly stared at me as if I was speaking a foreign language. Eventually another gal came up and said there was nothing they could do for me. I asked for both of their names and she gave me hers, Jael, but said she was unable to provide the other employees name. When I asked her why, she said she just couldn't. I drove away completely appalled and disappointed in my experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the portion has gotten so small that a two-entry plate  won't even provide enough food for one."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at Panda in many years (though I used to frequent the Chandler Fashion food court one and its corporate sibling Hibachi-San), but I was supporting a fundraiser.  The cashier was very personable and friendly.  Good for her.  However, I personally feel like a to-go order should automatically have soy sauce, napkins, and serving utensils thrown in.  Thankfully I had asked for chopsticks and soy sauce, and had grabbed napkins on the way out.  Notice the rangoons are labelled \"cream cheese\" and not \"crab\" as they don't seem to have anything in them besides cream cheese and a tiny bit of green onions.  They were also over-cooked.  The honey walnut shrimp was floppy, syrupy, and reeked of too-warm mayo.  Hoping I don't get sick off these.  The sesame chicken was basically honey-doused fried chicken strips.  These were probably the most edible thing in the box.  The white rice was old and dry.  This was especially disappointing, as fresh, steamy, sticky rice is a basic requirement.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in during my lunch break since it was close by. It was slow there was only one person in front of me being served first and I was fine with that. The lady finished with her then she walked away. So I stood for a few minutes waiting for someone else to come help me and finally another guy did. He served me but was rushing me since other people came through the door. He asked me 4 times if I wanted spring rolls and every time I said yes, he then ignored me and pushed me back to the lady who magically reappeared. She then asked me if wanted spring rolls again. Then at check out she asked if I wanted a drink I said medium. She ignored me and ran my card, never gave me a drink and walked off. I flagged her down and had to run my card AGAIN for a drink. She walked off again and I go to fill my cup and the soda machine was turned off. So I went back to find someone and I got the lady again and she started getting rude with me when I told her the machine was off.  I am a very hormonal pregnant lady and I was in tears afterwards because I've never been so frustrated with this poor of customer service before.  On top of everything my chow mein was burned and the orange chicken was so overcooked and hard I thought my tooth was going to break eating it.  Thanks for ruining panda for me guys."}
{"text":"Please stay away. I waited 15 minutes for a order and still didn't get a 2 item right. Then try to order a drink and no ice REALLY!!  Service is awful. If I can give a negative star I will."}
{"text":"I have been here over 4 times now, food has been bad everytime. I thought ok it's new, working out kinks. NO! Food is still bad and the last time I went though the drive thru it took over 25 minutes from the time I dorve up (no one in front of me) to the time I finally got my food. I complained to the lady once they finally brought me my food from having to pull aroud and park. She sent the manger out, he sntaches the receipt out of my hand and says I will refund your money. Guess what...NO REDUND! I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Don't offer something you willl not do. Chef Panda btw gives my girls toys when they DEILVER FOOD to my door. GO TO CHEF PANDA, it is better quilty food anyways."}
{"text":"I can't believe someone would give this place 1-star based on price and quality.  It's Panda FUCKING Express. Other than the PE at Six Flags Magic Mountain, this is the second/third time I've had it. It's cheap, it's passable, and it does the job. You know what you're walking into.   Vegas is incredibly expensive and finding any place where you can pay $20 for two people to eat and be satisfied is good enough for me. And you're probably drunk anyways...  I stayed at the Venetian, so I came here twice and it's so busy that the food is always coming out. Does that mean it's fresh? Nope. What it means that at least it's not sitting there for hours.   I tried the fried rice/noodles (bland), the orange chicken (good), beef & broccoli (good), and the teriyaki chicken - which was the best thing after the girl poured sauce all over it. Also, get the LARGE drink - it comes with free refills. After you're done, have them fill it up again and pour some alcohol in your drank. Be practical!   Overall, a decent place. It's Panda Express, people. Calm the fuck down."}
{"text":"Beware of the Attitude they give you through the drive thru.  I've never been asked for an ID with a debit card purchase in 10 Years at this Panda Express location. The moment I asked why the ID, the first thing that came out of the mouth of the young girl cashier was \"you don't have to give me attitude\".  I asked for their Manager and the person on duty said it was a policy they sometimes do. I guess they can racially profile their customers whenever they choose too."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this chain.  Food is good quality and tastes good.  I like their firecracker chicken."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food fast & clean. =0)"}
{"text":"This is a review of several experiences but today is the end for me. I have no complaint against the actual food that is provided here it's just like any other panda. My problem is with the customer service or should I say lack of... I have been coming to this location as my primary form of greasy Chinese for over a year and have plenty of negative experiences but the icing on my cake was getting to this location 20 minutes before close to have no selections to choose from being denied a Chinese staple like teriyaki chicken was my last straw."}
{"text":"11/9/17 very impressive for Chinese fast food. I thought maybe because it was close to closing it might be not so great, but It was it was very good and hot. the chicken egg rolls where crispy and tasty. It was 9:45 close to closing and the door was locked and they seen I was in s big truck and they let me in. over all I'll definitely go back for more. I got the bigger plate and it definitely could feed me and my wife I didn't even eat half and I'm full and I'm a big eater"}
{"text":"Had to pick up a party tray for an all of a sudden gathering, I walked in, insanely busy for Sunday night, immediately greeted by young man in glasses, I asked him for party tray of noodles. Quickly had the cook make me a fresh batch. Paid for it & was out in 10 minutes. Great service from this place."}
{"text":"I decided to try Panda Express at the mall this time over the other fast food Chinese places.  What struck me was they slice the chicken breast in front of you so you know you are not getting chopped up pieces of whatever which has always disturbed me about the other places.  They also cooked the vegetables up fresh for you.  The flavor was really good for the price and I thought the portion was just right.  I was able to have a fulfilling meal and take some home for later.  I liked the Teriyaki sauce on the side too so you can regulate how much you want on your food."}
{"text":"This particular location of Panda is in my opinion the best I have ever been too. The staff here are super into their jobs and pay attention to detail from food prep to taste, packing and serving. Everything here I've ever had looked like a menu picture- which is unheard of.  I work in the same shopping center at Tropicana Beltway and I'm here maybe once or twice a week. My only complaint is that the lines at lunch sometimes are out the door. Otherwise, a great place with quality fast!"}
{"text":"WHY does this location continued to be a problem???  Poor management?  Apathetic owner?  We stayed away for quite a while thinking MAYBE things would improve...NOPE!  The staff are rude and clueless.  The order is almost ALWAYS WRONG!  WTH! If I want Panda ever again, I'll bite the bullet and drive to a different location.  Shame on you."}
{"text":"We go to this Panda location because it's close to our house, BUT...I'd rather drive to a different location just so I can get better service and better food!  Our order last night was TERRIBLE!! I ask for extra chow mein and it seems to be a big deal.  Hey, more chow mein means less entree which I would think would be welcomed being the entrees cost more?  I don't know.  To add insult to injury, the teriyaki chicken was burnt and sweet fried chicken was old and tough. All in all, it was gross.  And the spring rolls were soggy, which to me means they weren't cooked all the way through. Gonna have to pass this place from now on and get my Panda elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I love it. I've never had issues with my order. I did have to wait one time for the grilled chicken, so for those of you complaining that this is frozen breaded chicken, duh! If you want fresh cooked chicken get the teriyaki grilled chicken breast.  This place is busy during the usual busy times but I've never had problems with my order."}
{"text":"This is the town square location. I called to place an order and the lady who just answered could not answer my question so I asked to speak with someone else and she said hold on. I waited about 5 minutes while she had a full conversation about what days she was working with someone else. She then picked up the phone and hung up on me. I tried calling back and they instantly picked up and hung up on me. I tried back for a third time where they just left the phone sitting there without a greeting, and now they're phone is off the hook. I guess I'll take my business somewhere else. Horrible costumer service. She was very rude and could barely speak any English."}
{"text":"I had the SweetFire Chicken Breast entree at this location, and it was very tasty. This is located inside the Miracle Mile Mall, and we were able to get a seat right in front of the \"thunderstorm\" show. The prices here seemed reasonable.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This location is the closest if you're staying at MGM and Excalibur. The employees are friendly and the food is good. The prices are a little high here, but then again, this is Vegas for you.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"portions have been getting smaller and smaller every time we go here. didn't seem very busy, but yet service was kind of slow."}
{"text":"Make sure you're receipt says what you ordered.. They trend to ring up your order after your at the window and sometimes do it wrong"}
{"text":"Francisco with the excellent customer service and attempt to upsale me ... food here is always fresh because they seem to have enough customers in and out .. I enjoyed the bowl  half rice half noodles .. n Shanghai beef I think It is w crab ragoons"}
{"text":"Horrible service every single time I come here for my food. But I just love the spicy eggplant tofu, so deal with it. But they are always out of it or just don't make it. They tell me it will be made if I order two orders of it,which I do and wait for 10 mins for it....and then they fill other others with it while I had paid and waited for it. Manger has the worst attitude, and on certain nights there is another young lady that has the worst squeaky accent ever and she talks to you like she is demanding you to order something.....I finally have decided to move on from this place....I just hope corporate re trains their staff In customer service."}
{"text":"Panda Express is good, this location is the worst.  When you come in the first thing you notice is pans full of crusted over food.  Remnants of the lunch rush that they have not refreshed. Good luck getting 2 items, you'll be standing around waiting.   It seems like they make 18 lbs of orange chicken in the morning so they never have to make it again.  Service is abysmal, food is always terrible.    The owner needs to come in once and a while to see how bad it has gotten. Maybe they already know and don't care?  Every 2 months it is a completely different crew.  Don't go here, even the signal butte location is better.  Avoid this location like the plague."}
{"text":"I remember liking Panda Express more when I lived in Cali... I guess not! The food was fresh but mediocre at best! The place was clean and the workers seemed very nice. Nuff said, lets move on..."}
{"text":"The man with tatoo on the neck gave me  Less food,maybe cause i m asian in line,  Portion size very little at this Panda."}
{"text":"What a miserable excuse for customer service! I placed a large to go order a few weeks back on my way home from the doctors office. I am in a wheelchair and was taken to this Panda Express in a wheelchair transport van. I got the order home and realized I was missing 3 egg rolls, so I called and spoke to the shift manager (cannot remember her name) and she remembered me and knew the egg rolls were not placed in the bag and asked me to come back to get them. I explained that I can only come when I have wheelchair transport for appointments and the driver is nice enough to stop for me, so at that time, I was unable to come back out right away to retrieve the missing egg rolls (which they forgot to put in the bag, but charged me for anyways) so she said she would replace them on my next visit. I called today to speak with her but she was off today. I spoke with the store manager, Nikoin, and explained the issue, to which he REFUSED to replace the egg rolls and could not have cared less that I was disabled and unable to come back that same day. Are you kidding me right now? I spent over $50 that day, and I go to this Panda Express at least once a week. I cannot believe they would treat me this way. I was sending someone to place an order to feed 14 people today and just wanted what I paid for last time and did not receive but after this, I will NEVER go back to this location again! I will take my business elsewhere, where I am treated with dignity and respect!"}
{"text":"Horrible service from this place. Pulled up before they were closing like an hour prior and when I got to the speaker after waiting 15 minutes they only had two thing to choose from and I couldn't picked off the menu . Rude lady at window and couldn't understand her broken English ."}
{"text":"Went here on a lunch break. Not bad, not great. It was a medium lunch rush, and we went through the drive through The woman with King working the drive through was slow, and had a less than competent understanding of English It took longer than it should have for me to order a 2-entree of Chow Mein with double orange chicken. And yes, I spoke clearly and slowly.  We waited after paying for 8 minutes for a 2 entree and a bowl of  with shrimp on top.  Just handed the food out the window No Eye contact, no smile..."}
{"text":"No sweetner for us diabetics, waited 5 minutes for mixed veggies. Tables outside were filthy.   The food was ok. Cant give 0 stars."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and made fresh. The staff was very courteous and gave me a free drink for having to wait on the black pepper chicken.  The wait wasn't long it was only 3 minutes or so. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellents sushis frais et gouteux! Personnel aimable, service rapide. Font la livraison! Meilleurs sushis dans Hochelaga!"}
{"text":"This is not my first visit to this store; been here many a time!  By the time I've ordered and someone finally decides to come to the register to ask about drinks, my food is cold from the excessive air coming out of the vents right by the cash register!  This \"cold food scenario is not the first time; as a matter of fact, it's every time!  On top of cold food, this particular day a woman walks in to purchase gift cards, steps in line in front of us and the cashier gal had to help her first as our food is getting colder by the minute! We did ask one of the employees to lower the A/C and she was kind enough to do so! Great food as usual though!  After reading the additional postings, it is clear that this store has no regard for it's customers or the quality of food or employees!  Maybe Corporate should have a talk with this franchiser!  Hit the franchise owner in the pocketbook by trying to make a wrong into a right!  Give that wronged customer a freebie! And, I was there again this past Thursday; low and behold, my Mothers and my food was Luke warm when we sat down to eat and cold within minutes!   Way to go Panda!  In my opinion (as a customer), stop trying to appease with \"your talks to Corporate \", it's not working!  You're going to lose customers that will find someplace else to spend their hard earned dollars! Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Nice store. Good food.  Staff can hardly understand English.  I had to explain myself twice.  Not Very Nice."}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express in Goodyear/Litchfield Park area. Portion sizes are being withheld. Have confirmation of this from an employee who says the manager is telling them to give smaller portions to make more money. And just confirmed with a bowl that I ordered and was half filled. Oh and if your military make sure they give you the discount, cause more than likely they will \"forget\""}
{"text":"I've been going for awhile now and everytime I go there, the food is always fresh and the employees are always smiling and greeting you. I have no complaints with their service or food."}
{"text":"This review is about this location. I eat at panda 1-2 per week. This location just never has their act Together. Today worst experience to date. As usual they are out or very low on everything. I order a bowl with rice, veggies and teriyaki chicken. Place is dead I'm told 5 Mins, 15 mins later I'm handed the wrong order. She proceeds to be confused. I also asked for it here and she made it to go. I was basically told I was wrong and I got what I ordered lol. She then asked other employees and still got The weird oh well. Finally some girl tosses my order out makes another which I repeated. The bowl was half full and again to go. No apologies, bad attitude etc .... I'd love to take over this place and get it in shape. The enteees are also often very inconsistent with cooking. I can honestly say, it's the only location I've experienced any of this.     Alex thank you for the follow up but I can't get that link to work."}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood and this is our second time coming to this location. It's horrible. Both times the employees were EXTREMELY rude! The orders are sloppy and just thrown together and they ALWAYS mess up our order. Didn't even give us fortune cookies or napkins!! We will not be visiting this location again. Needs some definite turn around."}
{"text":"The drive up at this location is deplorable! Always super super slow. Today is the worst I've seen. Over 45 minutes! Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"They really need to work on customer service.  I placed my order online and paid online also.  I went straight to the counter as I was advised to get my food a few minutes after the designated time, since I had to wait on traffic in the parking lot for 15 minutes due to the poor design for traffic flow.  A manger was called over and said my meal was already picked up.  I politely told him it shouldn't have since I was sent out to get it.  After thinking for a minute he said I don't know what to do this order was already picked up.  I remained calm and told him that they must have given it to someone else.  He then proceeded to ask me for my license to verify I was who I said I was, like I was trying to pull a fast one over on him.  Finally they remade my order and offered nothing for my long wait or troubles.  I highly doubt I will be returning this establishment."}
{"text":"Got busy right as I came in and they were rushing people along. Feels like I didn't get as much food as usual."}
{"text":"We've been to the other panda express locations throughout our area and no one compares to this location. Friendliness, freshness, availability everything is perfect. Maria recognized us as we were opening the door greeted warmly she exceeds all expectations she goes out of her way for every guest. We love Maria!"}
{"text":"This is a Panda so when I go all I want is my consistant good food fast. This location is no different. Always yummy fresh Panda Bowls & quick. Thank you Panda for my Chinese lunches.  Tip- substitue the vegis in your Panda Bowl for the calorie laden chowmein & carb rice. Your skinny jeans will thank you."}
{"text":"Dirty, food was old, no help, everything had to been made and the place was near empty @ around 9:30pm...Bathrooms were filthy, trash cans overflowing...Last time I'll be going to Panda Express..."}
{"text":"Always hits the spot when I don't know what I'm hungry for. Food & service is great.  Priced just right."}
{"text":"very good fresh tasting food that's cooked where you can see them. the walnut shrimp is my son's fave & mine is the famous orange chicken. i also like the chicken eggrolls that i usually get for free when using a survey coupon. we go to this location on Hualapai & West Charleston every week if not every other. the staff is very friendly & accomodating to my special needs child."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I'm literally sitting here waiting for my food to be cooked. I know it's nice knowing my food is being cooked fresh, but for a fast food place to completely run out of the things I wanted is just bad. I'm now having to wait 15-20 min for a fast food place to cook my food is ridiculous. They should know that the popular food items that are running low should be made right away to replenish before it completely out. As I'm waiting another customer came back in to complain about his order being short; I think he was in the drive through. I feel bad for the people thinking the drive through would be any faster since they too had to wait for the items to be cooked. Also while sitting here waiting for them to cook the tables are all completly dirty with crumbs all over. I will still eat Panda Express in the future; it just wont be from this location."}
{"text":"They were stingy with their portions and the chow main tasted smoky. But the Beijing chicken was good as always =)"}
{"text":"Worst Panda I have ever been to!  Worst staff and management of any fast food restaurant ever!  (I am just too lazy to call corporate and complain, but they just have no clue what they are doing.)  First, up charge on everything. Felt like a typical Vegas scam - but all of the food was an additional fee. Then, soda machine was out, informed staff and was told they would fix it. I sat, I waited, I sat, I waited, I sat, I asked, then waited some more. Then eventually the \"manager\" came out. I assume she was the manager, she had no name tag on, but she was wearing a different color tee-shirt. She said, oh, nothing is wrong with them, we checked it ten minutes ago. ???? What was I waiting for. I asked for a refund of my soda - she did, minus the tax ... she said oh, that is only $.02 - actually, I think it was $.12 - but not the point. Don't you refund it by entering it in the register? Strange ... and then, I commented my food was ice cold at this point. Told her I did not want any of it, she offered to bring over fresh food. Few minutes later, she brought me half of the order, and I waited another 10 minutes for the rest.   Time for a training class in customer service 101."}
{"text":"Eh, not so good this time. Had to wait. Food was bland. Poor husband said fried rice had no flavor. Only thing at was good was the Orange chicken and the employees were smiling."}
{"text":"Way over priced!!! You can get better quality food for half the price at other Chinese fast food"}
{"text":"Working staff are very nice people.I was ordering a veggies,and they didn't have at the moment (5 minutes to wait),so I change my mind for something else.After I ordered a meal a manager gave me these veggies for free.Also this place always clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Walked into the place. Like was moving quickly. Service was good. Food was good. People were nice. I'll come back again when I'm in the area. No MSG I LIKE IT"}
{"text":"I guess it's a step up from food court Chinese food, but not as good as if you went to a regular Chinese restaurant. You can order by the bowl (Cheapest), or by the number of items. I had the two item combo, which comes with rice or noodles, and two entrees.  Be aware that if you want shrimp as an entree it costs $1.50 more. (I didn't read the fine print). They also advertise the fact they have at least 8 items under 400 calories.  I had the teriyaki chicken as one of my entrees. I guess I should've known better then to order a Japanese chicken dish in a Chinese establishment. It was good, just didn't taste like teriyaki sauce.(Very gingery).   That all being said, I think I would come back.  Not rushing for that door, but if I get a craving then maybe."}
{"text":"This store refused to fill an online order placed an hour before they closed and then threatened to call the police on me if I complained. Then closed the store 30 minutes early and left. I will never order from Panda Express again."}
{"text":"Horrible service this location refused to fill an online order placed an hour before they closed then they closed 30 minutes early when I went to pick it up. I will be filing a complaint with corporate."}
{"text":"I purchased orange chicken and white rice and the orange chicken didn't taste right it just tasted like eggs... It was very odd and it was just really disgusting, but other times I went the food tasted fine."}
{"text":"It has a decent selection of food here. My favorite dish are the orange chicken, firecracker chicken, and the beef dish. They serve it pretty fast which is a plus. The vendors are nice. The servings sizes are large for the price that you pay so make sure you are hungry when you go here. The facility is clean and bathroom was clean as well. The cream cheese rangoons are delicious! I could eat them all day but don't want to die from a heart attack lol.   I don't have much else to say about this place because it is fast food. This isn't a pf changs or a pei wei. The food is of a lesser quality but what can you expect. And as I said the servings sizes are large so you get plenty to eat. It's hard to find fast food asian places with a drive through so that is also convenient when you are on the way home and don't want to get out of the car. Would I eat this if there was another option next door and I was in the mood for asian? Maybe not. But it's convenient and fast. Check this place out sometime."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant on the GCU campus as far as customer service goes. I found out that panda employees here are the only employees hired direct from panda and not GCU. They are giving panda a bad name because they are continuously semester after semester some of the rudest people I have ever come across. They always rush, give attitude, are out of things, and forget your fortune cookies."}
{"text":"I can never go wrong with Panda! I don't think anyone can actually. It's usually kinda full but well worth the wait. Some people complain about  the price but the quality and taste of the food is well worth $7 or $8. This location can get be a little more occupied than others due to the location but like I said I don't mind. Great for dinner!"}
{"text":"overpriced for the sheer quality of food, I've had better Chinese out of the freezer, the beef broccoli had two smalls pieces of beef and just overall greasy bland lackluster food,and to boot the folks putting in the food were indifferent but the one star to the nice cashier gal"}
{"text":"Umm I will pass on here again. Prices were reasonable and good size portions, however, it just didn't taste very good.  The noodles were hard and had no flavor. The steak was good, had a very nice crisp on the outside and good seasoning.  The onions with the steak were raw and overpowered the steak.  The chicken egg roll had a really off flavor and the inside consistency was mushy. I didn't even eat half of the eggrol. The service was quick but not very friendly. Overall, not impressed even for a quick serve concept."}
{"text":"Be ready to wait 10min in line! Terrible customer service experience. I honestly wish I could provide less than 1 star review but it's impossible. They always forget to add something to my order and again horrible customer service thru the drive thru!"}
{"text":"Fast, convenient, Chinese fast-food in the middle of Phoenix. This location receives a tremendous amount of traffic, but rarely runs out of food (causing a delay). Have rarely seen the place dirty, and have never had to wait more than 10 minutes.. All in all, a great, quick stop for Orange Chicken!"}
{"text":"One of the best pandas I have ever eaten at, Great staff and amazing Managment. Greeted with a smile and offered samples. smiles all around will definitely come back to this panda !"}
{"text":"I like Panda Express but this location is the worst !!!  Terrible Terrible service . No manager at the store.   Got there at 6:00 only to be told they had no fried rice !! The wait was 25 minutes because the \" first batch wasn't made right & we had to throw it out !!\" Will not be there again & hope someone will fix this store !!"}
{"text":"Service is insanely slow.. been sitting at the drive thru window for over ten minutes for one order that I was told would take two minutes.10 minutes later my food is finally handed to me. Checking the clock I realize by the time I get back my break will be over, so starving I pop open my meal to steal some bites at a red light- it is stone cold. Will not return to this location, if you can't manage a drive thru then don't have it. If you can't manage and prep correctly for the lunch hours you need to replace your management."}
{"text":"I had never tried Panda Express due to my own personal skepticism. When a coworker mentioned that it was good, I decided to give it a try. She was not wrong. It is surprisingly good! So good, in fact, that I have eaten here several times since my last check in.  I take lunch later than most people (2pm) so I have not experienced any problem with getting what I want. The Chow Mein noodles are consistently fresh. The Orange Chicken is always flavorful, the Beijing Beef satisfies my need for fried meat, and the fried shrimps are always big enough to satisfy my appetite.  I have to admit, I have only tried the fried meats, and I am happy to keep it that way. Give it a shot. It is A-Ok."}
{"text":"Very clean... much cleaner than other Panda Express.  Food was fresh & taste great.  You should try the fire chicken breast..AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible.  We've been here several times and they have been out of rice.  Last I checked that is a staple when it comes to \"Asian\" food."}
{"text":"If you are desperate and have no where else to turn. This come close to Chinese food. I suggest going 2 China One in the Smith shipping center. Way better food for similar prices. Actually I am holding back a bit. Call me a snob but Panda is horrible."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is bad. The only advantage this horrible Panda Express has is that it is on campus. Students just have no other choice. Line is freaking long and slow. Some Certain foods always need 10-15 mins to be ready. Should call it sloth express. I Won't choose Panda Express at all out of campus. Bad bad bad."}
{"text":"Close earlier than posts on website and closed even earlier than posted on the door. Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Went in to order spring rolls. Told this to the first attendant,  he didn't tell the second one,  resulting in us getting cut in line.  Finally had to dip in and tell the girl,  and when the cashier greeted us she had no idea of our order.  No communication and terrible service."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star but not because of the location but because of the customer service, today I walked in and gave a lady my spot in line to be pass an act of kindness. She then proceeds to have THE WORST attitude I've seen in my life.  I felt so bad for the nice girl at the register trying to help get regardless of this chicks attitude. That girl needs a raise or something. Kudos to this place for hiring the kind of people you'd want at any establishment. If you happen to see this good job on handling that situation and remember there will always be miserable people trying to spread their miserable ways. Keep your chin up."}
{"text":"I've complained many many times to management but my complaints fall in deaf ears. What kind of Chinese Restaurant runs out of rice? Especially since in the parking lot that this one is located, they have a Super Market? Who runs out of rice? And the other day they ran out of water so they were not cooking food? Why not close? This is by far the worst excuse for a restaurant there is. And don't bother voicing your opinion...nobody cares. I asked the cashier how could you run out of chicken and she laughed at me. I then said last time you ran out of rice. Who runs out of rice? She laughed at me again. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and every time has been a bad experience! First time there was only 2 pieces of meat in my beef & broccoli . The second time I went through the drive thru again and waited over ten minutes to get to the window. I asked the employee if my order was ready or if they were making more ... She then told me they were making it . I asked how much longer and she said 3 minutes so I decided to keep waiting and she then asked me to pull up to the front and wait . It took longer than 3 minutes .        I don't know if it's the employees, lack of training or just the management not having enough staff . But I will not be going back again !   And please Panda Express don't respond to my review with the same generic response that you've responded to all the reviews on here about portions and how all stores have the same portion sizes !"}
{"text":"The food is good for fast food Chinese, but the staff here is attentive and polite. I frequent because the staff! They take good care of you and the food is good."}
{"text":"People are so quick to post bad stuff,  well here's the good stuff that I'm so eager to post !!! This is the best Panda Express I have been to yet!!!  great customer service!!!  very generous on portion of the food!!! they ran out of certain item we wanted.  what's left of what we want was really small amount , the lady gave it to us to try anyway. Very nice lady I think her name is Sheetal... We need more people like her in food service/customer service. Great place to be eating some good quick Chinese food. Everything looks really fresh!!! We will return!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the lines are usually long and they often run out of food. Not just during rush hour, when you would expect it, but also at odd times like 3pm when you'd think they'd be mostly empty, there are often still shortages of food and decent lines."}
{"text":"Good service bad food. My chicken was burnt! I live too far to go back! This makes me really mad! Like I mean it burnt like charcoal burnt! How do you mess that up!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was superior to others in the way that the manager was so kind & nice to us when we ordered & was a gentleman.  He told us in a loud kind voice that he appreciated us being there & ordering from them."}
{"text":"None of these employees wear gloves while handling your food. Watched several employees go from cleaning with chemicals to touching my food. When asked for a corporate number I was told by the employees they don't have one and to go to their website. I waited for a manager to speak to and she dismissed me after having me wait over 10 mins for her to get out of the bathroom. This location is terrible. Will not be returning. Update finally got the number for corporate for anyone who needs it. 18008778988 The manager here is Ashley. I had the employees hang up on me and refuse to give me their names. Absolutely ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"The service is fast, I got my to go order in 5 minutes vs Popeye's where I didn't move in their drive through for over 25 minutes. Don't know what is taking long over there. $5 meal for 25 minutes wait. Oh no, come to Panda and you can eat right away!"}
{"text":"After waiting 20 minutes in the drive thru. Getting a bowl of white rice thats was well under cooked. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The same tasteless soggy disgusting 3rd world mess you get at every other Panda Express featuring the same \"rubber beef\" and elastic mystery chicken pieces. Great thing about their chicken is that you can chew it for days without it breaking down and you don't feel too bad about eating an animal since no chicken shape ever served at Panda Express resembles any part of an actual chicken.  There are not words to fully describe how much this place, and the \"food\" they serve sucks. I cringe when I see the huddled masses in line to purchase it. I think every time... have any of you ever tasted chinese food? Anyone? The irony is that there used to be a fantastic chinese/thai restaurant in the same shopping center that was bought out and changed around. That place would be 1/2 empty while panda express would have long lines. Sometimes the world makes no sense.  The food served here (and any other Panda Express) would be more at home being served by Joe Rogan during an excruciatingly disgusting portion of \"Fear Factor\". Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Nothing like spending 25 minutes waiting for food just to have them mess up your order."}
{"text":"The Panda Express In Cuyahoga Falls is a great addition to the neighborhood. If you've never been to Panda Express it's much like your local Chinese restaurant, but with a sprinkle of fast food. The inside is clean and there's a lot of seating to choose from.   Hard to complain about chinese food...yum!"}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST Panda Express on this side of the country! I live down the street from here so the supposed convenience is why I even bother going back. Anyways, the service is slow, let me repeat S-L-O-W! They are always out of at least 3 entrees at any given time. To make matters worse when they do over cook they let the food stay in the heaters until it literally cooks to death and then they have the nerve to try to serve up that dried up crap! You have to literally tell them you want a fresh entrée otherwise they will give you that crap that has been sitting out for God knows how long. Save yourself the headache and time and only come to this Panda if you must indeed eat Panda cuisine.  Oh yeah customer service? Pfff what's that? They will not bother to say \"hello\" nor tell you how long it will take for the chow mein and fried rice to be ready, so you're just standing in line waiting- looking like an idiot. SMH!"}
{"text":"Like this place but they close at 10pm and it's 9:15....looks like they are ready to close and all food looks picked up. Not appealing. They did offer to cook something but they are cleaning the cooking pans...hmmm????"}
{"text":"It's like any other panda, if you like one you like them all same food. This one is nice and clean"}
{"text":"The longest wait for \"fast\"food! I was told it would be five minutes- I think that is code for 10-15minutes"}
{"text":"First time to Panda Express not the greatest would of expected better it was not what I expected 2 hour drive.      The staff was ok not the greatest, not one of them smiled. The thing I did not enjoy was how the staff did not get the customer order right. . I feel like friendly ness of the staff could be improved and better. The low main noodles was so dry with no flavor.  I find it kinda strange how majority of it entree items were missing hardly of a selection to choose from.   The orange chicken was spicy had a bite to it the black pepper chicken was not black pepper chicken like you find at a Chinese buffet     Thanks panda I won't be back"}
{"text":"I'm the only one here slow down, manager Kathleen isn't a very good people person. I would probably demote her to back of the restaurant so she can't interact with anyone."}
{"text":"YICK! WELCOME TO NASTYVILLE, South Euclid.  EXTREMELY hard rice.  When I brought my bowl back up to the counter a line worker lightweight yelled at me and loudly informed me that \"IT'S STEAMED RICE! THAT'S HOW IT IS!\" Ummmmm...nope, been eating STEAMED RICE since BEFORE I had TEETH! This tasted like y'all just poured this \"steamed rice\" straight out of the bag Ms. Attitude! OYE!! In comes the manager...much more pleasant!...but SUPER OVERWHELMED, He changed my order from rice to noodles...NOODLES WERE HARDER THAN THE RICE! UGGGGH! Never fear! Never coming back HERE again! C'MON Panda Express, get it together!   #BOOOOO"}
{"text":"Had the black peppered chicken with the Kung pao chicken and fried rice, food was tasty and service was fast; however, everything was cold and tasted old."}
{"text":"We typically love Panda, and thought this time would be no different. Although the food smelled amazing, when we got home to eat the food was blah. the rice was SUPER dry/overcooked. The orange chicken lacked major flavor, which crazy bwcause we wauted for it to be done. The cream cheese rangoon were burned and tataed like that had been sitting out a while. The Beijing Beef was delicious though."}
{"text":"I can't imagine too many people turning to a review site before heading to a well known fast food place like Panda Express, but just in case on that off chance someone is looking, here goes!  Food: It's all cookie cutter style food prep- that being said, this location even managed to mess this up. I love love love pot stickers!, I buy them at any Asian joint I go to, make them at home.. I have DREAMS of gyoza dipping itself in fresh ponzu sauce and feeding itself to me, because I love them so much! (well, maybe not that far, but almost.) However, this is the first time I have eaten what equates to a Gag Rubber Gyoza.. =( It was sadness for the tummy. I couldn't even pawn off the rubbery \"treats\" to my German Shepard. She just sniffed it and gave me the stink eye like I was trying to poison her with them.   Customer Service:  I have said this before and I will stand by it every time; I don't expect 5 star service from a fast food joint. I understand these are minimum wage employees who more than likely die a little inside every time the put their uniform on in the morning.  I get that this job will not be the one they fondly remember as \"the good ole days\". That being said, don't make me feel that way too please! I don't want to feel like the life is being sucked out of me because of the Eeyore atmosphere.   Price: WOW, I remember when it was actually cheap to eat here. For 2 people, with 2 item combos, and portions smaller than they used to be, it came to more than $18! I could have gone to one of those mom and pop Chinese shops, got the lunch special with soup, egg roll, and bigger entree portions for less. And the food didnt even taste fresh. It definitely was NOT worth the cost and lack of atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like Panda Express' food but this location just can't seep to get things right.  I've stopped here now three different times after work because of the drive-thru and because my fiancé asked me to.  On the first two occasions they got my order wrong and on the third and last time they gave me the incorrect change which was weird because she was about to give me the correct change but for some reason, took it back and said \"sorry that was the wrong change\".   I let it go because it was only a dollar-or-so but, if I can do the math in my head then it should certainly be easy enough to follow on the register.  Three times in a row can't be a fluke!"}
{"text":"Place was a little busy and kinda unclean but the food was fresh and the portions were big so I'm happy."}
{"text":"I came here late at night and they were out of almost everything. The staff was under staffed and kinda struggling to make all the orders, I felt bad because they were trying."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new and it does have its problems.. it's usually busy and sometimes at night they don't have white rice for some odd reason.. but it doesn't deserve a 2 star rating, yeah they are working out the kinks buy it's clean and brand new. Once the employees start to be here for longer periods the place should run smoother."}
{"text":"This location is actually very clean compared to others I have been to. The service was also good. On the other hand, the food tasted like armpits. Not sure what was wrong with my fried rice but it was not good. The kung pao chicken was not the best either. The chicken was horrible and it did not have enough sauce. The vegetables were not cooked all the way through. I would recommend going to the Sahara location instead."}
{"text":"???WORST PLACE EVER???  WORST Place EVER... Horrible Customer Service..  Yusterday (6/24/2017) I went to get food thru the drive thru with my family & so I ordered & everything so when it was time to pay I decided to change something I had order for a kids meal So the server(JENIFFER A.) that was attending the drive thru at that time gave me a super bad attitude was rolling her eyes and also threw my debit card in my face ( She threw it like for me to catch it ) That was so disrespectful and rude!  I did get off my car to talk to the manager ( Gabriela) but she didn't even make her appologize she just stated she will talk to her thats it !    Also the Supervisor ( WENDY) the one that backs up the manager when shes busy stated that they had watched the cameras and never shows where she throws my debit card in the face!  But yet the Server will pass infront of me while taking to Wendy laughing in my face So basically Wendy said I just got off my car and made a whole scene for nothing just because Like if i had invented everything.   ?They have to educated there employees more and get people who actually like doing customer service! ?"}
{"text":"Slowest panda drive thru ever. Have to wait for them to cook everything because their always out.  These people don't even care what there serving look at my cheese Rangoon below. Just shameful....."}
{"text":"You guys all follow the same recipe for your food. Why does this location SUCK AT FOLLOWING THE RECIPE?? Only eaten there 3 times and there won't be a 4th. Get you brains together and actually make the food right instead of slop it together. Do you realize how over priced the food is? So if I'm spending $40 on fast Chinese food I'd appreciate it to match the rest of the chains locations. Thanks."}
{"text":"I don't get why this location is always so greedy with their meat?! I ordered the meal combo and expect meat in my stir fry but when I got home I see three piece of tiny ass chicken in my Kung pao!!! And the beef broccoli really?! U give me so much broccoli but the meat were jst 4 tiny piece!! I don't know what's wrong with panda lately but u guys are becoming greedy with ur portions sizes!!! We don't want to pay 8-12 bucks for combo meal that u guys jst give whatever that's left which are veggies! Get your lazy asses and cook some more then if u were running low! I tried this place twice and jst been disappointed. Would u like to go home with a job full of veggies and lilttle meat?! Nope! U would've been upset as well! So u guys need to rethink what u guys are doing with the portions! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Every time I have gone here the food was greasy and a bit too old. I usually like Panda and this is closest to my place so I have been disappointed...then I went in mid day recently and it smelled so bad I had to leave. The staff is always nice though."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. I came for lunch, to-go order, at 11:15. The place opens at 11:00. The two items I wanted were not ready, grilled teriyaki chicken and string bean chicken. Very disappointing. How can the entree's not be ready if the place just opened??? When I got to my car I realized the server didn't ask if I wanted teriyaki sauce for my chicken. I went back in and got some. When I put it in the bag, in car, I noticed she did not give me napkins, a fork or a fortune cookie. I had to go back in for the items. I gave two stars only because the items were hot when I receive them. Funny thing is, the manager was sitting at a table, eating, when I walked in. Maybe she ate all the teriyaki and sting beans."}
{"text":"This panda sucks. It's seem like every time we come in there is no food. We always have to wait. The staff are not the friendliest. They seem more lazy and hate working there. There seem to be no break room for the staff bec they have their crap out on one of the table but the register. If I could give them no start I would be the manager doesn't seem to give a crap either about this location. ZERO STAR."}
{"text":"I had been to this Panda Express a couple months back and it was a horrible experience and I honestly didn't think I would come again. I tried it out last week to wait out the rush hour traffic because I work close by and I'm happy I did. First off I was greeted. The food was a lot better. I got the Shanghai angus steak, fried rice and egg rolls.The dinning room was clean and attended to. A tall man (in all black was very professional so I assume is management)  was going around to tables checking on customers. Great friendly energy when being asked my order. I noticed some old faces but mostly new ones. I'm sure is what made my experience better as well. Overall I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, so we've all hit panda up hungry not wanting to cook. They're known for their portions..Right. Ok so when I walked up the counter ready to place my order first a young lady looked at me and walked away as if she had something better to do. Cool, you don't have to help me. So here comes Julio, only individual wearing a blk shirt must be important, and he greets me a proceeds to fix my order as directed. One thing I noticed was he tried...and I do mean tried his best to make my portions small as he could possibly get it. I'm just smiling and taking it all in. I pay for my meal and I want to observe how other people of color are treated. I noticed the orders for theHispanic customers were being made much differently as if they had more rights as a customer. I didnt see anyone holding back on portion control. What to do? Come to yelp and blast these companies that belittle black Americans."}
{"text":"They never give me the correct order and tonight I got there at 930 and they told me that they turned their fryer off and did not have ANYTHING that I came here for. Clearly poorly managed."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and keep giving it another chance, but my last visit is my final one. The brown rice was undercooked and the entrees had been sitting in the warmer too long. The meat was dry and chewy and the veggies soggy. One thing I noticed while I was sitting there eating was the difference in the portions being served. It appeared the to go box was getting much more serving than the dine-in plate, so if you want more food get it to go. Seems like the servings are not equal depending on who is doing the serving too. This place is one of the consistently worst Panda Express stores I have been to."}
{"text":"Literally, the most disappointing fast food experience ever. Not only were they out of nearly everything by 5pm on a Friday, but the meat that we got was cold and tasted old. So disappointing. Never going there again."}
{"text":"These guys really saved the day when I ordered catering from them for my team members at work. I ordered $350 worth of food and didn't realize that it was set for me to pick up and not be delivered. I gave them a call and asked if there was any chance at getting it delivered and after a quick check an employee named Jovy offered to drive it basically 30 minutes to get it to us. I'm so thankful for Jovy and she went above and beyond to help us get our food. It was also still warm and delicious so 10/10 would cater again."}
{"text":"Hate it when you order and every items comes with\"50cents more\" - just put it on the menu they have big screen tv's they can update pricing.   This was annoying. But the food great. Service good. Do ask for chopsticks they assume you just want the plastic fork.   Loved the new bacon dish. Whomever dreamed this one up is a genius. Chicken honey and bacon. You cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I usually only go through the drive thru. The food I order always seems to be good. I am met with friendly service at the window. My issue is that they run out of things quite often. I like the string bean chicken breast and more times than not they don't have it. When they do seem to have it, there's none made. So, I opt to wait 6 minutes until it's done. I also like the  Shanghai Angus Steak. It has an additional charge of $1.25. I know now but they don't mention this additional charge in most cases. I like the food so I continue to come back. But, these things could improve."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times during lunch since it's close to my work. The inside is usually clean and the customer service is always good.   My recent visits have been at the drive-thru. They're so fast! The food is ready by the time I get to the window! The employees are always smiling which you don't find a lot at fast food chain places!  I like how simple their menu is and how it helps me to pick the lower calorie items since I always try to eat healthy here and there.   I would come back again and again whenever I crave Chinese during my lunch hour!"}
{"text":"A long line for panda is not unusual. But tonight 45 Minutes in the drive thru is not okay. We finally get to place our order to find out there isn't any chow mien. We ordered two panda bowls with fried rice one with teriyaki chicken the other with orange chicken. We got a plate with double orange chicken and fried rice. We get to the window and nicely ask why there isn't noodles and she tells us that 2 cooks called out and the new cook has been cooking for 2 days and has no idea what he's doing. I ask is our food gonna be good and she's says it should be. So we get home my husband takes one bite and spits it out immediately. I said to him is it really that bad you have to spit it out and he said you try yours. I take a bite and I too immediately have to spit it out. Our orange chicken tasted NOTHING like orange chicken. I have to add we are new to surprise and this panda has the best orange chicken in the valley. But tonight IT WAS TERRIBLE. obviously it's due to the fact that the cook is 2 days in and has no idea what he's doing. Rice had no flavor. We didn't let our kids eat theirs afraid they would become sick. I called and spoke to Angel who was apologetic and said they are aware of what is going on. She adds in that they put the wrong sauce on that batch of the orange chicken. She offered a refund. So back into the car we go to get our money back to find out we have to wait 5 days for our money back. Really panda I have to wait to get that money back. It's now 9 at night my kids haven't eaten dinner and we have to wait 5 days for our money back. I understand every restaurant gets call outs and are short staffed but if you can't produce your product to the full standards it's best to close for the day and not serve people inedible food that could make them sick. Very disappointed in the customer service tonight."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times after staying at Planet Hollywood (now Elara).  Let's be honest..... sometimes greasy Chinese food is good after a night of heavy drinking! We made a stop to this Panda Express location since it is located inside the Miracle Mile Shopping Mall, and our suite is located upstairs in Elara! This Panda Express can get pretty busy considering it's popular and busy location!  FOOD ------------------------- - Chow Mein - Good! - Fried Rice - They actually use brown rice for their fried rice now. Not a fan... - Beef Brocolli - good! - Orange Chicken - Good!  SERVICE ------------------------ I was surprised at how slow they were this time around. A lot of their foods weren't prepared so we had to wait longer than usual!  3/5!"}
{"text":"Only problem with Panda Express is that there is so much sugar in everything. I love the food but know all that sugar is a no no especially with type 2 diabetes. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Be careful....I saw the guy serving the food and handling money. When he will serve my food I asked him to talk to  the manger and he said 'I'm the manager ' still I told him the risk of food contamination with the money but he didn't do nothing turn back to the food and keep serving food without washing his hands. Place has no FDA licence to be reported !"}
{"text":"I came in right at open and they pretty much had nothing ready. They told me 2 minutes on mixed veggies and 10 on the entree I wanted. I didn't want to wait 10 minutes so i changed my order but ended up waiting more then 10 minutes anyways on the veggies and when i got them they were still pretty raw. Very disappointed. I'll avoid this location for now on."}

By this time the line behind me is wrapped around and people are honking. I finally get to the window it's now 853 pm they girl gives me my food and says oh wait I need to get the sweet and sour for your ragoons. So now I am waiting again I finally get to drive off at 856pm. Not sure if I will return to this location"}
{"text":"A little pricey for the location. But good sushi and good service."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I see 2 employees cleaning the floor, 2 employees walking in from outside with the trash can and 1 employee in the back near what I assume is the office area. Not one of them acknowledged me, it then took several minutes for one of them to finally come over to me. She walked up and said \"Hi, gimme a minute\". Was a bit rude in tone but I thought maybe shes going to go wash her hands since she was just cleaning, at least I hope she was, and she did. The sink was right around the corner so I could hear it, it was on and then off again in about 30 seconds so did she wash her hands properly after working with chemicals and then taking my food order, no. She then came around the corner and asked \"what do you want\", she seemed in a rush to get rid of me and continued to have attitude through the entire transaction. Once I payed she walked maybe 2 steps to the side and started talking about some personal drama with another employee there so apparently me coming in must have been interrupting their conversation. I needed some sugar packets for my iced tea and had to interrupt their convo to ask for it which she gave me a dirty look for and then immediately turned back to her conversation and said \"anywayyyysss\". If you have to put up with the employee Selena L. I apologize. Shes rude and whatever you do don't interrupt her personal conversations. Management, I'd suggest a discussion with this employee shes very rude and obviously does not care about how she holds your company because she doesn't know the difference between personal time and work nor does she have very good customer service skills. She seemed great at mopping though, so maybe just keep her on that."}
{"text":"This is one of.my favorite pandas I drive farther to this location because of their fresh food and good customer service"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight from here they made all our food fresh and gave us free drinks while we waited for our food to be done cooking. Thank you."}
{"text":"1 star rating is only because of the manager Ivon's reluctance to hire 16 year olds. The restaurant is always clean and the food and service is always excellent and the manager Ivon is always friendly and appears to be a great leader.   My problem with this particular location is only that the manager didn't hire my son based on the bad experiences she had with other young employees. It isn't fair to young teenagers like my son to pay the price for other teen employees that were a problem. Ivon made a mistake by not hiring my son based on his age (which may be discriminatory), he would have made a great employee. I don't believe Ivon intentionally set out to discriminate, however the fact is she did and may God forgive her. Like I said, she is a great leader and employee but she shouldn't have done that. My sons feelings were hurt because of the situation, she should have given him a chance.  What's disturbing however is the fact that HR@Corporate has ignored the report, Shameful !  @mikeysha... I doubt it, panda express is pretty consistent on being repugnant."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have ever had with Panda Express. Two girls were too focused on the good looking young man in front of me. Giving his samples and giggle  Never offered a sample never offered appetizers, or sauce with the appetizer ordered. Wanted to rush me. Got home less then two miles away food barely warm, hard pieces in the fire chicken like stale. Usually better turn over keeping food warm. Do you not check the temperature? We have to where I work?Should of tried it, well I guess I will dispute on my card it's pretty visual.  Called it rang 32 times so hard to take up with management."}
{"text":"Took my sons for lunch at Panda express. They overload the rice or pasta section every single time I go to that place.  I've paid for a kids meal (Wok steak shrimp meal) $5.50 plus an additional $0.75. The lady dumping the rice all over the plate also mentioned this kids meal menu only gets 2 (TWO shrimps). And that' what we got.   Asked one of the employees manager's phone number. They showed me the phone number on the back of the receipt as the manager's.  If you fancy to pay $6.25 for TWO shrimps plus a side in a kids meal, then this is your place.  Can I give it negative rating?  I would if I could"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because we don't have any in my hometown, but I simply CANNOT resist eating at a Panda Express whenever I see one. The quality of meat and the flavor outperforms all your run of mill Chinese restaurants and definitely the MSG-fest buffets. I like to refer to Panda Express and \"fast food PF Changs\". Love it, need one at home!"}
{"text":"The manager Julio sucks .. no customer service at ll my company eats here every word at least $80 orders and this time I had 7 orders and he would not let me pay us pay separately for them .. like really?? We have been doing separate orders for a year now..our Company will not be back in until there is a new manager!"}
{"text":"Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"panda panda panda...... what can i say, i love the fact that they are fast and always fresh. this is not really authentic chinese food but when u are in a hurry and need to get your fix in for chinese this will do...."}
{"text":"Typical Panda Express.  If you've tried one, you've tried them all.  This one is cool since its in Von's, so you can eat then shop, reducing the amount of impulse buying!   No drive through though."}
{"text":"Do NOT bother going to this Panda Express!! Besides being rude beyond belief I have gone in 2 times in the last couple weeks and they never have the brown rice. Once was even at opening time!!! No apology just rude comments. Don't bother, go to one of the other places to eat nearby."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. I agree about the noodles. Completely flavorless. I don't understand why this location is having culinary issues when I've eaten Panda Express at multiple locations. For some reason, this one doesn't have anything great tasting. The sauce on the chicken was really thick with an interesting after taste. It was supposed to be teriyaki. The chicken itself you can tell doesn't have salt or pepper before they cook it. Needless to say, we will be going to our usual local spot."}
{"text":"Every time I pray and hope it won't be the worst thing I eat, I'm wrong. My rice was uncooked, all my meat was fatty. The only good thing about my meal was the fortune cookie and my drink. Get it together!"}
{"text":"I've always ignored the reviews for this location because it's so close to my apartment and I've never personally had a negative experience....until today.   I went through the drive-thru around lunchtime. An employee greeted me and asked me how I was doing over the speaker system. I remember hesitating a bit because I was focused on reading the menu. I said: \"Uhh..I'm good, thank you\" (The hesitation at the start of my reply is important here).   Then directly after those words left my mouth, the girl repeated \"Uhh..I'm good, thank you\" and laughed. She then awkwardly apologized for her outburst and went on to take my order. I was taken aback because my first reaction was not that she had just mocked me but that maybe I had asked her how she was doing without realizing it. But then I replayed it over in my head and I definitely did not ask her how she was doing and she did, in fact, mock me. Like a middle schooler. She even got my hesitation down perfectly at the beginning of my reply. I can't say that I've ever been mocked by a grown adult before but I guess there's a first time for everything, huh?   Aside from this, the food was a let down. The chow mein was about 5% noodles, 95% vegetables. If I wanted that many vegetables, I would have just ordered the steamed veggies. Also, the veggie spring rolls were very mushy on the inside.   I'm never coming to this location again. The people that work here, as well as the food that they serve, should not be acceptable by Panda's standards. I get that it's a fast food restaurant, and quite honestly I feel a a little silly writing a review for a place like this, but there should always be a level of professionalism in every business, no matter what it is."}
{"text":"Awful, awful!!!!!! Went to get a kids meal ($6) with my panda express gift card that I have had $50 on and used at multiple panda express locations. This panda express location is closest to my job therefore I went there-when the drive-through girl told me my card wasn't working I asked to see a manager. The manager came over and I sat in the line for a good 15 minutes before they finally open the window again. The manager said that the card had the money on it but her system wasn't letting it run. I asked what can we do. She asked if I had any money other than the gift card. I didn't at the time have my debit card on me and I told her that the gift card was the only cash I had on me she threw her hands up and said that she didn't know what to do not even offering to hand me the kids meal that was only six dollars!!! Was $6 really worth a pissed off customer manager????"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese places, surprised by the negative reviews. Always great service and food is great"}
{"text":"Panda is a consistent product just about everywhere I have been.  This particular location is no exception.  Tasty Beijing beef and orange chicken with bacon with noodles...delicious!  All this enjoyed in what is single handily the LARGEST PE dining area I have ever been in!  My only complaint with this location is the indigenous personnel strolling in and out of the lengthy business.  Enjoy your chow but keep your head on a swivel."}
{"text":"If you are feeling hungry and craving all that PE has to offer, I recommend coming during  the off hours.  The lunch and dinner rushes can be brutal.  Not only will you have to deal with the masses inside, but the parking lot can be ridiculous as it is poorly designed and small due to sharing with other busy businesses.  This particular PE serves up what every other PE does.  There is nothing special about it.  It is just like another PE in a strip mall, only this strip mall parking lot sucks."}
{"text":"Yummy tasty Panda chow served quickly in a nice clean location.  The staff particularly friendly at this location.  It also has a drive-thru....BONUS!"}
{"text":"Rolled in on a Friday night, not wanting anything to do with having to make dinner or wash dishes.  The parking lot sucks as there is a lot happening in this corner of the parking lot.  Lot's of bodies were ahead of me, but the PE staff keep the line moving and seemed unaffected by the human waves crashing down on their Orange Chicken.  Was in and out quicker than I expected and upon ingesting my Panda found the quality to that of any other Panda.  A solid option when you don't want to do anything other than eat."}
{"text":"This Panda uses containers that are actually raised in the part where your food goes so you don't get as much food.  I feel insulted that they think we the consumers wouldn't notice this packaging gimmick.  Go to 59th ave or lake pleasant pkwy instead, they have larger containers and so you get more."}
{"text":"I usually love this location. But today, they lost a star. They are promoting their NEW Peppercorn Shrimp, right... Well, I go to order it and the employee (who must be new because I've never seen her at this location) bluntly says \"We are all out.\" No apologies. No suggestions of anything else. Just a blank stare. Really? This is a new item and you run out? You don't stock enough? When has Panda Express run out? It's not even 6:00pm on Saturday! The rush hour has just begun!!   So I'm now a bit irritated and finish ordering, struggling to decide on the last entree. (It was SUPPOSED to be the NEW peppercorn shrimp.) I'm ordering for a big family of 5 so I'm spending close to $50, OK! So after I give payment she informs me that she won't fix my order until the food is ready. (2 of the stocked items I ordered were not cooked.) OK. Well. That's cool, I guess. Except for the fact that your warming trays are NOT stocked with food and it's 6:00 pm! Saturday rush hour! You KNOW this!  As I sit here typing this, there's a line out the door.  This is why I advise people to avoid Saturday at retail and chain places, or anywhere popular for that matter. Didn't listen to my own advice today. Boo me. Boo Panda Express.  I ordered a large drink, since I have to wait and all. You would think they would offer a free drink for all my troubles. Not today.   Again...Didn't listen to my own advice. At least the food is hot and fresh. That's the silver lining. If it weren't for that and the fact that this location has been good to excellent before this experience, it would have had 2 stars instead of 3.  Order is up. Took 10 min. It better be right. It better be good. I've got hungry mouths to feed. Later!"}
{"text":"They never have teriyaki chicken and fail to inform you it'll take a while until after you pay (drive through) (it has happened 2 times already)  Dine -in lines are always humongous and tables are never cleaned. Staff always seems rushed and bothered."}
{"text":"So beyond disappointed. As a business owner I don't have much time to get away from work for lunch, their location was clearly open as they had other clients inside. I waited patiently outside until someone came to open the door, only to be told that they could not help me. That they had a catering order that needed to be filled and weren't able to allow me in, but there were clients already inside! If everyone had been turned away I would have understood and moved on, but clearly they chose who was and wasn't allowed and I felt it was extremely rude and inappropriate! I will never be back to this location again."}
{"text":"Omg. You call this fast Chinese food?  Who is doing all the cooking?  The steam rice tasted dry and the zucchini with chicken was under cook. What ever happen to customer service?  I guess they were not train. Cashier asked me do I need a tray after I told her that i am eating my meal here.  Of course I need a tray and please wipe down your sticking disgusting dirty tray. To top off my bad experience, I also found a roach crawling along the window edge. I will never come back to this location even if they offer me a free meal."}
{"text":"I've had Panda Express once before from here and I wouldn't rate a fast food so I'm not. This is what I think their food is worth."}
{"text":"Always good for a last minute dinner on the go. This location sees a fair amount of traffic and can be a little short on parking. They often need to make new batches such as the orange chicken or cream cheese wontons but the short wait is worth it to ensure hot, fresh food. I've had very few issues with the service and hardly any with the food so if you're in the mood and need quick but tasty, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Two things about this location: always out of teriyaki chicken (not a huge issue comparitively) and EXTREMELY RUDE CASHIER BY THE NAME OF DAVEONA!  She is beyond disrespectful, not only to customers but to her manager.  She is very condescending to both as well.  Her attitude and comments toward my husband and I were so bad we asked to speak with the manager. When he (manager) approached her to talk to her about the incident she said, \"don't even talk to me right now\".  Had that been my employee she would have been told to clock out and go home.  Sadly, this is not the only time she has been rude when we've been there, but this was the final straw.  We will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a million times and the food is always really good. However, the lines are always really long for a really long time and they always run out of food. The restroom was spotless and the tables are always cleaned after they are used."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible. I'm already not the biggest fan of panda over the years, but this makes it my official LAST attempt to like them.   I ordered food from UberEATS, with about an hour before closing time. I immediately get a call saying \"we don't have any more Beijing beef\"....I said \"ok, what do you have?\".....she paused and said \"that's fine we'll just make it for you.\" Ok cool that was nice of them.   Then the food arrives. Nice and warm cuz it close by, but I'm at work and did this to save time. Well I ordered 1/2 noodles 1/2 FRIED rice. Well...I got noodles, a lot of them, and a small scoop of WHITE rice.   Well I said, \"I'll just eat it, no big deal, at least it's warm\".....until I did eat it. You know that rice,l that's been sitting in a pan too long...with no water...just heat...a lot of heat? Well that's what I got in that small scoop of incorrect rice. Not to mention hat small scoop was buried underneath all the noodle. So even the parts I did take out. Wasn't enough, and I still had those tough, crunchy, rice grains my whole meal. Thanks for being lazy guys  Next time, if you don't have it, tell me you don't have it. Because I'd rather be missing food that have disgusting food"}
{"text":"I have always had great service from this Panda Express. The employees are friendly, pleasant and pretty quick, even on their busiest days. On my last visit,  Tahirah was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"You know, for fast food Chinese food, Panda Express isn't bad!  As a practice, I stay away from chicken (It's a little public restaurant phobia of mine.  One bad experience with undercooked chicken will do that to you...) The Coconut Shrimp and Lo Mein I had were great.  So was the Crab Rangoon! The portions are very generous and you are in and out quickly.  Great spot for a tight lunch break or a quick meal."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Panda Express I have been to. The food had no flavor. We had the string bean chicken, beef and broccoli and chow mein. The beef had no sauce and was dripping in oil. The forks are so cheap they broke in our food. The customer service while ordering was good but it could not compensate for the bland food. If this was our first time eating Panda Express we would not choose to go there again."}
{"text":"Food is good but they might as well call their orange chicken spicy orange chicken because this place piles on the chili flakes... Kind of disappointing when you take a bite expecting their usual sweet and tasty chicken and then bam! The spice hits you and that's all you can taste and no amount of soy sauce can help.. Sad to say I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Twice in a row they don't have honey walnut shrimp. Waited in the drive thru for 10 minutes to be helped and told they are out. Don't come to this location."}
{"text":"Very decent Fast Chinese take out, you can be well satisfied by the portions vs price they offer. The meal deals are fantastic try their amazing cashew shrimp and orange chicken, soo goood! Perfect for on the go and take back to your room snack."}
{"text":"Not real Chinese food.   But it's a healthy and quick restaurant. Especially when you need to go to class."}
{"text":"Just ordered through Uber Eats. I ordered a bowl with mixed veggies, white rice and orange chicken and a side of veggie egg rolls. The white rice had tons hard chunks in it. It felt as if i was trying to chew through plastic! They also didn't give us any soy sauce packets and we made sure to ask. They completely forgot my veggie rolls and that's what I was looking foward to the most. The chicken was ok. The \"mixed\" veggies we're straight up just broccoli. Eww. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"This is the second time at this location both two years apart and each time the food has tasted burnt. It always looks good and the employees are very friendly, but I had to get a refund this time because I couldn't even attempt to try and finish it."}
{"text":"This is the second time I come to eat here and there so slow and understaff. There is only one person serving the food and one cashier that I think is the manager or asst manager. Super slow service and again the fountain drink station is broken. Food is good but service sucks and poor. Recommend to walk next door to Burger King, where you can have it your way!"}
{"text":"They changed the recipe from what is advertised and didn't tell me about it.I got all the way home with my food and found out my two favorite ingredients are not in the recipe this locations uses.  As I normally do, I ordered  SHANGHAI ANGUS STEAK which is advertised on their website as having \"Angus steak wok-seared with fresh asparagus, onions and mushrooms in a savory sauce.\".  What I got was steak, GREEN BEANS, and onions. No asparagus or mushrooms which are my favorite parts and why I order it. They put lots of GREEN BEANS in to cover up that it was missing two other items. It was more like a green bean casserole with a couple pieces of tough beef thrown in.  Also, the compartment that holds the fried rice was only half full and not the usual portion I normally get.  I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"They get worse every time I come to this location!  Not only do they skimp on portions, but...where's the flipping meat?!? Seriously???? Where.is.the.meat!? When I order string bean chicken, I expect string beans AND chicken, not just string beans, and ONE piece of chicken. I asked for mixed vegetables, not just broccoli. So sick of the lower quality, lower service,  and they raise their prices after cutting portions. I'm sick of it! Go to New Asian Star on 99th ave and Lower Buckeye instead, better quality, cheaper, amd free egg rolls with yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say this is the first time this has happened but they short-cut the cooking time to rush food out the door... Rice was crunchy and partially cooked as was the black pepper chicken.   Portion was measly... loaded with rice and a couple pieces of black pepper chicken. Avoid this place if possible."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru tonight and ordered string bean chicken breast & black pepper chicken. THERE WAS NO CHICKEN ON MY TO GO ORDER!!!! The employee literally just put a ton of onion and a ton of great beans!!! They were too lazy to make a new order if they were running low or even tell me while I was ordering my food! It was towards closing time so their employees get too lazy to make more food! They were sure quick to take my donation to Phx Children's hospital! All my donations better better fully be given to the charity! I hate this location! This was my second disappointed trip to this location! Never coming back again! Lazy employees! The photo I'm attaching will show there was NO CHICKEN!"}
{"text":"The food at this Panda suck and they are suppose to close at 10:00 pm but they shut down at 9:30."}
{"text":"Today's date, 4/20/18 at 4:15pm MST walk in. Tried the new Seared Steak and Shrimp, or should i say Seared steak with a shrimp on top? because it literally had one(1) shrimp on it! On these kind of entree, they usually charge a dollar or more, which is not a problem at all. but when they give you unequal servings, it's frustrating. i ordered string beans chicken a month ago, it literally had 3 tiny bits of chicken with bunch of onions and string beans. i didn't wrote a yelp review to give the restaurant another chance, but then it happened again."}
{"text":"Wow just went to Panda Express off the 101 loop and Northern Ave.  The prices are up and they changed the containers for the to go food that are half the size. What a joke! This was my last visit to Panda Express."}
{"text":"The noodles in their chow mein were not hydrated enough. We order green bean chicken but it was like green bean onion entre because there was mainly onion and very little chicken.  I'm giving this store 2 stars and doubt it deserves that."}
{"text":"I have to go 4 stars at panda because food is food and always fresh.  Moreover the price is really good.  Best bang for the bucks if you are tired of burgers"}
{"text":"Very clean and employees have always greeted me whenever I go in. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"UPDATED 10/16/2016  Today there was quicker service, the employee at the window was there right when the car pulled up, very attentive, and all of the sauces napkins and silverware were already included in the bag without having to ask for it. There has been a definite improvement!   ---- Standard location for panda express and this one has a drive-through which is convenient!!  However the wait times are not as convenient which is unfortunate and defeats the purpose. The staff does not have urgency and the wait times are even longer when you get your food without them asking if you would like sauces chopsticks etc. Just  don't come when you're in a hurry. What should be a 15 minute trip turns into 45 minutes very quickly."}
{"text":"I came to grab food with my husband and son we ordered a family fest which I thought is a great deal for the large entrees . The Manager in charge was very personal and well trained . He stepped in to help his employees on the floor with the rush.  I give this store great customer service ."}
{"text":"I ordered mushroom chicken and my chicken was pink and not done. I ordered a soda and went to grab my cup and she said I didn't charge you for that. She made me wait at the front of the line while she rung up the man behind me. So I had to pay twice. Bad service and bad food. Also like someone stated in a previous review, none of the employees were wearing gloves."}
{"text":"All around standard! Stopped by for lunch on a whim when out running errands. The location seemed nice & clean! They were running low on quite a few of the options. The guy serving us was really chill, wouldn't describe him as warm or particularly friendly. The other staff were all on lunch it appeared, sitting at a nearby table on their phones. It was a pleasant enough experience."}
{"text":"Food tastes like plastic !! What a place.. no customer service at all. The 2 girls behind the counter were absolutely rude. The tasteless food was overpriced. Prolly was worth $1.15 not the $9.00 I was charged. Quick tip: run away from there, go across the blvd to Chin Chin, inside New York, New York Hotel. You get charged $8 for a decent chicken n Shrimp fried rice !!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get Chinese food wasted. The portions are decent and the food tastes good. I recently have become a fan of the surf n turf on the menu. Steak and shrimp together with all these flavor combinations was different and tasty. This last visit I stopped by for lunch and got their 2 item entrée plate. The noodles weren't dry or crispy like some locations can be. The Beijing beef and surf n turf were very good. Being charged almost $11 after adding a large pepsi was a rip so I will stop at Terrible's and grab a fountain drink there next time instead since a drink at Panda is as much as another side of food."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is located inside Vons near the produce department. I like that I can grab something to eat while getting a few items at the store. It just is convenient without having to then make another stop for food. I have to say the employees here are awesome. Well, the manager this last time was having lunch and talking with someone (maybe having a meeting?) while this girl was hustling to take care of the orders. I questioned how long something has been sitting out and she offered to make it fresh if I didn't mind waiting. Of course not! I can't believe how this girl was working so hard to take care of the customers and offering to make me fresh food while the manager laughed away in her conversation only a couple feet from me. She should have excused herself and pitched in for a moment. I took the time to tell the girl helping me that she was a hard worker and that I appreciated her service. I only wish I caught her name to give her a shout-out in this review.   I like to get the 2 or 3 item combo. I always choose fried rice because I find their chow mein to have too many veggies vs. noodles and the noodles are kind of dry. The Firecracker Chicken had good flavor. It isn't very spicy but has a nice baby kick. I tried Beijing Beef and it was sweet and spicy and my favorite of all I ate.  For my 3rd item I got Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was sweet, crispy, and good. The Cream Cheese Rangoons are a nice snack on the way home and aren't greasy. If you don't want your food to go, they have tables."}
{"text":"We walked into a clean environment. It made us feel comfortable getting our food from this resturant as we are very picky about where we dine. Overall, very happy with our experience. Food was very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"They work fast if you're in the drive thru line, but they end up messing up your order. If you order inside, they're pretty stingy in giving you any kind of meat. Don't order the walnut shrimp because you'll end up getting 5 pieces and have to pay $1-2 extra for it. Not the greatest experience. Head on over to China Chilli (3rd st and Osborn) if you want authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Shout out to Manny! He was very helpful and kind. The older lady how ever took the bowl Manny was making and put way more white rice inside and a little main entree. Not to happy about that."}
{"text":"Very courteous and polite. Even asked if I wanted to sample taste the Teriyaki Chicken. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"We saw it when we went to Chipotle next to Harrahs one night and decided to find another one just to explore the strip, we decided to go to the Venetian and its quite upmarket!   I've never been before so can't compare it to other outlets but the food was super, really flavourful and plenty of it, would definitely have gone back for more! I had the sweet fire chicken and the string bean chicken both of which were LUSH!   We would say tho that the one next to Harrahs seemed to offer slightly bigger portions ;) but the Venetian wasn't crowded at all in comparison.   Really good value for money compared to the high prices on the strip!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through on 11/22 they ran my card 3 to 4 times saying my card was declined. I pulled my card transactions on my phone and showed them it showed all card swipes pending I had money on the card. An Asian man I'm assuming the manager says he will cancel my order and the pending transactions will put the funds back to available. I never received any items and left thinking this was cancelled. Yesterday I saw that all but one transaction was reversed. I got charged $5.00 without receiving any goods as it should have been cancelled like they said. I will not be going here ever again."}
{"text":"Clean lobby and the workers here are nice. Located on a busy corner of Tempe, the parking is a bit tight and parking lot traffic is pretty cluttered with the way the drive-thru is angled. The manager seems like a really nice man, and all the workers seem happy."}
{"text":"Waste service ever. Walking to the restaurant in the whole entire staff felt like they were irritated by people walking in and asking to place their orders. Then the young lady who took my order forever to get my order after being done handling my order walked over and open up my food at the cash register. I asked her why would she do that and she smiled and said cuz she forgot what it was. I'm trying to figure out if I got two sides and it's what you need to know what I ordered all you need to know again or to side combo. This is the dumbest that I ever seen and I would never eat at this place ever again"}
{"text":"the manager is very rude and always has a bad attitude. short staffed- It took me more than 20 mins to get through the line because the employees were slow and very short staffed. also, it's dirty, the table I sat at had food all over the place and the drink station was always filthy with spilled drinks all over the place. I don't recommend this location at all. Especially if you don't want to be treated so poorly and receive a bad attitude from the manager and staff. If i could I would give it 0 stars."}
{"text":"Despite the negative reviews that this place has, I can't say I have any complaints! Driving by it multiple times, I promised myself I would come here soon. I was excited Panda had become there own establishment. When we came in, we were greeted and served very quickly. The employee was kind to explain how the bowl works opposed to the plate, given that it was our first time here. One thing I was not a fan of was that the lady didn't tell us that steak was extra until it was already on my plate. I wouldn't have gotten it if I knew it was $1.50 (kind of a lot just for a different kind of meat?) but felt bad because she already mixed it with my rice. Anyway, the employee overall was very nice and helped us all the way to cashing out. The dining in experience was quiet and very clean. I can say I had a pretty good experience and would consider coming here again when in the area."}
{"text":"I have never had a problem here before but yesterday when I went through the drive through. I received the wrong order. And so when I went inside to get the correct one the cashier rolled her eyes and snatched th food from me. So rude"}
{"text":"I must have caught this place on a bad day .   First thing i see opening the door is one of the employees taking break sitting at one of the tables.  I'm sure there is a policy about this. but perhaps the first table that a customer sees is not the best idea.  right near these tables there was a black cover that was just left there.  Im not sure if it was a cover for chairs? or umbrellas maybe? tables perhaps? either way it was left danging over the trash cans near the front.   Second this place seemed understaffed for 6 pm.  There was one person running the line, i was behind a family of 6 or 7 who cleared out most of items i wanted.  Its no biggie since that's the risk you take with this type of restaurant.  The person that was serving everyone was calling back items they were running low on, eventually 2 works came out with blue bags full of frozen nuggets and dropped them in the fryer.  It was obvious these 2 workers didn't want to be there and seemed less than enthusiastic to be there.  for the food.  well lets start with the \"new\" fried rice, with the card on the glass saying \"due to an industry shortage of eggs try our new fried rice and let us know what you think\"  I'll save another form trying this. its not good, move on.  The original product with egg wasn't exactly spectacular, but it was good.  This new version is just not good its more like cafeteria flied lice than anything.  for the first item i opted for the orange chicken which is usually a safe bet, but this seemed like it had been sitting out for a while and i got the bottom of the barrel.  The orange chicken was one of items being prepared by the \"chefs\" .. next item i wanted to try the honey chicken.  Once again just not good. it is chicken strip like pieces breaded and fried.  This appeared to be sitting for a while when i chose it, and im pretty sure i was right. it was nasty and I didnt bother finishing it.  Finally the Bejing Beef... the parts that were edible weren't bad.. but many pieces were hard as rock and i didnt bother finishing this item either.  \  Overall a  so so experience with crappy food.  with a 3 item and a drink and $13 gone  .it's  not worth it. find another place to go."}
{"text":"Its Panda Express, what did you expect. If the food is fresh then its good. I was not very impressed with this particular location as the service is not good and the food seems to always be old. Just go somewhere else unless you are desperate for chewy orange chicken."}
{"text":"My first visit to the restaurant was a good except the noodles were dry as hell for a new restaurant everything should be on point. But I will give you another chance it's a good place first time I had the food DWF airport waiting for my plane was coming home from a trip to Dallas TX that why I went to the New place here in Cleveland. I hope my trip the second time is better than the original visit"}
{"text":"Well, my first visit to Panda Express ever was a mixed bag of feelings/emotions. In fact, i haven't written a Yelp review in a while but I felt the need to say something...  First, the food was good. In fact, it was better than I expected it to be. I tried 3 entrees (SweetFire Chicken Breast, Beijing Beef and Black Pepper Chicken) and none was bad. In fact, i would gladly eat these dishes again.  The main problem was the management. I walked in and there was a line - not long, but getting there. There were people waiting for food while others were walking past them with their dishes to pay. When I got to give my order I started to let the girl there know what I wanted when the manager (i'm guessing) came and pulled her from the line while I was talking. So, she just walked away. I came to understand that she'd been doing this for a while and this was why others were waiting for their food and while others left without their food - clearly pissed off. In addition to this, they were running out of obvious things like fired rice which they should consider making in bulk to be quickly reheated. So, they're running out of food asking customers to wait and then pulling the employees who were creating those customers' dishes leaving them to be forgotten.   It's gonna need to be improved considerably. I'd give the food 4 stars but the service was a 0-1 star experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service and empty pans. We have been to this location three times and every time they have empty pans and are understaffed. Never have the apologized for the long wait.  I will not return to this location.. I will stick to the one on Estrella."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat at the drive thru window for 15 minutes. Never came back to the window to tell me what was going on. Ordered 2 bowls and they were half full. Was thinking of getting my food from the casino, I will go the extra couple of miles to get Panda!"}
{"text":"Standard Panda food at standard Panda prices.  Just across the street from Mandalay Bay, this is a great place to eat when the gambling gods have been unkind to you, and you are not getting comped for meals."}
{"text":"Five stars due to this being the best Panda Express I've ever visited. The girl behind the counter was polite to the person in front of me OFFERING samples to them. When I stepped up she was super polite to me and offered me samples as well, and thanks to the sample I ended up getting the honey sesame seed chicken. Absolutely delicious. I asked for both noodles and rice and I expected the usual half-assed scoops of both but this girl hooked it up big time on everything! Despite all these bad reviews I will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Both times, the food has been fine but the customer service has been below par.  I ordered the orange chicken with the chow mein and she asks what type of entree do I want.  Ummmm....Orange chicken, I repeat.  What kind of side.....ummm.....\"chow mein\" I repeat.   Not a \"thank you\".  Not a \"Please come again.\"  Takes the payment, shoves the food out the window, window closes.  I won't  be back either."}
{"text":"good food but not enough sauce.   none of the employees looked happy to work there.   This place is not my favorite location,  just convenient.   I'm glad the recipes stay the same but they need more variety, like  a dish of the month that covers all meats...not just one per season."}
{"text":"It's Panda. It's the only fast food close to my house and hence we go there out of desperation and desire for OK Chinese food. It tastes fresh and The coupon on the back of the receipt for a free entrée is used every time we go."}
{"text":"This Panda Express in located in the food court at Red Rock Station. If I come here during the week I have a better chance of getting a table to eat at. The tables are clean which is a plus. The soda here is a decent size compared to the other food court places and they give free refills. This time I had Beijing Beef, Shanghai Angus Steak, and half rice, half noodles. My wife happily ate the mushrooms from my angus steak and I had a tasty, average dinner. Just what I expected from Panda! After a movie or bingo this hits the spot."}
{"text":"A-OK.  PE is what PE does.  I love the chow mein.  I really do!  This particular location offers up a drive-thru of which I have visited several times.  One the first visit there were several vehicles ahead of me.  On another visit I was the lone customer and rolled right in.  On my most recent visit, I ordered up what I had previously....a chow mein bowl with honey walnut shrimp.  Delicious!  The person at the other end of the squawk box was friendly enough on both visits.  What makes this purely a three star experience (based on an average) was my experience today.  Everything was rolling smooth.  Upon paying for my order, I was asked if I wanted any sauce.  I appreciated this and asked for chili sauce.  My request was repeated back to me...thus acknowledging my request.  Transaction accomplished, I was off to a corner of an adjacent parking lot to enjoy my meal.  When I settled down, I realized my chili sauce had been replaced with soy sauce. WTF?!  I thought about driving back, but decided against it.  Maybe my pleasant server was clueless or maybe she decided to amuse herself and f*&$ with me.  Either way...I had no time for either.  The food was superior (fast food wise) but the portion size and price had be wondering if I has been F'ed.  May I will return, may I will just order a regular one item with side.  Who knows!!"}
{"text":"This place is still relatively new so the dining area looks nice.  Food tastes like all the other Panda's I've been to.  Service is decent."}
{"text":"The food was abit greasy but overal good taste. We took 2 sides of teriaki ( if i am right with spelling) and spicey vegetable served with fried rice. Overall compared to fast food restaurants it stands well but definitley is too far to be compared to pf chang for example. Pricewise, it was abit expensive , 11$, but ok we are in vegas and everything costs legs and arms. :D"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love panda express. This place looks better than the others but the portion of food here is way smaller than the other. Its my first time going to this location because its the closest one to my work. I ordered a bowl to go with white rice and steak and shrimp ( the new entree), much to my surprise on my lunch break that the rice is raw, and only 2 shrimp and 2 steak???? For real people... I just paid $7+ with nothing...."}
{"text":"Horrible food.  Orange chicken was over cooked, rice was undercooked, mushroom chicken was gross, like it had been sitting too long.  Service was great but food wasn't fit for a dog.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is always busy...and its not because the food is great its because its the only half decent chinese option in all of Surprise.  Hey potential restaurant entrepeneurs, OPEN A GOOD CHINESE RESTAURANT in this over-populated city so I don't have to wait 10 minutes in line to get some orange chicken.  100,000 people and not once good chinese spot that delivers...are you joking?  And while your at it, open up a decent breakfast spot because Nicks diner sucks.  Good chinese food (WITH DELIVERY !!!) and a good breakfast spot would make millions in this town.  I've been eating Panda Express for years now, and this is one of the more inconsistent ones.  One visit everything is great and the next its like small portion city and everything was cooked rushed.  This restaurant was designed to make it damn near impossible to be inconsistent so I'm not sure how they are accomplishing this feat."}
{"text":"Let's discuss. This is not a bad location to get Panda Express food. I have eaten here 2x. Once at dinner and once at lunch. Really. The food is good. It's turned over a lot because it's busy. The line goes fast. The only down side I can see is that it's a bit dirty. The garbage needs changed out more often, the tables need wiped down more. But since the line is so long, the staff is serving so there is not enough time. But that's it. The staff is nice. Food is good. They will get the cleanliness down. I hope. LOL! They will score better once they figure out how to handle the rush and keep up with the store."}
{"text":"They have decent food but I definitely consider it expensive for the quality you're getting.   I've also noticed on multiple visits that none of the employees ever wear gloves-- like they all serve and cook the food bare handed."}
{"text":"The food was fast and fresh and pretty consistent with any other panda visit. However the cashier had such an attitude when I asked for soy sauce, chili sauce and my free fortune cookie. Other than that,  it was a regular day at panda"}
{"text":"Poor service. The rice is old.  I ordered teriyaki chicken x3 and all of them had no sauce!!! I called they said they would replace all 3 meals now I go back and they want to give me 1 bowl. Seriously?   Will not be back to this location ever."}
{"text":"Tonight service was awesome food was fresh and fast. I want to tell the staff what a great job they did handling a very rude customer, that made them remake her food and check the temperatures of the food. They were very respectful and kind even though she was not!. Good job I'm sorry she tied up your line, but u did great to keep it moving!"}
{"text":"This place is A-Ok is my book!   I walked in and was greeted immediately. A quick look over the selections and I decided to get a two entree plate with string bean chicken and mushroom chicken and fried rice.   I had to wait a few extra minutes because they didn't have any string bean chicken ready. So they offered to cook some up fresh for me and wait to fix my plate so the food would be nice and hot. Now, that's great customer service! The food was good, not great. But I like that it was hot and seasoned well. I was also very impressed with the portion size for the price.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service it horrible. No express about it. Would have giving one star if the food wasn't so good."}
{"text":"Ot was verry fast service and the food was freshly hot and Ariana the server was a friendly server."}
{"text":"This gets a star just for the Panda drive through mural. Just for starters.  I'm from Southern California and I'm used to chinese places with the buffet layout where you can see your items and sides and this is why I come here, nostalgia, ease and inexpensiveness. I like the Beijing Beef and noodles. So if you like cheap greasy Asian, boom here's your panda. PANDA. PAAAAAANDAAAAA."}
{"text":"Food is ok but slowest drive thru ever.  20 minutes.... really. And I was stuck in line so I couldn't get out. Obviously not enough help."}
{"text":"OMG Never again... !!!!    If zero stars were an option that it would be.  WOW  the Walnut shrimp was like eating stringy vainy (raw rubber)  had no taste was mushy, stringy, rubbery and tasted about 1/3 of the way cooked....kind of like a dog chewing on an umbilical cord  hope I don't get sick, am sorry but it was GROSS !  I have ordered this same thing many times at other Panda Expresses and it was very good, so I know what I am talking about.  Secondly the  Chow mein noodles  were dry and tasteless.  Thirdly the broccoli in my other side was OLD and had yellowing on the crowns and soggy along with 3 and I counted three tiny pieces of beef in my other side which were the size of 1 third of a teaspoon....Seriously it was ALL HORRIBLE!  last BUT not least........ the employees were RUDE did I say R U D E ?  The WORST RUDE!!!!  UN BELIEVABLE!  I DEFINITELY WILL BE CALLING CORPORATE  spent around $35 / $40 on dinners and drinks to go!  WE WILL NOT EVER GO BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER.  It was GROSS AND THE EXPERIENCE WAS UTTER MOST THE WORST! DONE DONE DONE.  I hope management and corporate read YELP...but i will be calling corporate.  Our visit was  Thursday the 4th of December 2014.  I really hope we don;t all get sick."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I felt an obligation to let my fellow yelpers in on my not so great experience at Panda Express. Subsequently, representatives of  the great panda wrote to me extending a heartfelt apology, and a peace offering in the form of a gift card so I could give they're restaurant another go. After trying it a third time, I felt it necessary to update my review to reflect my latest panda escapade.   I visited Panda Express around 4:30 on a Friday just as they were getting busy. I ordered a bigger plate with honey walnut shrimp, mushroom chicken and broccoli beef. I also got an order of cheese Rangoon's. As far as take out Chinese food goes, I can't complain much. It was about 12 bucks for everything. The honey walnut shrimp was sweet and had good texture, but it felt like it was missing another element of some kind. The mushroom chicken wasn't bad. In my last review, I mentioned that it tasted weird, and lacked chicken. This time around, it definitely tasted better, but the chicken to mushroom ratio was still a little off. The broccoli beef had exactly the flavor you would expect from average Chinese take, and had a good combination of vegetables.   Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but I'm still skeptical... after visiting a restaurant 3 times and having two bad experiences, I don't think it will be my first choice when I'm on the prowl for a bite to eat. That being said, they do have some redeeming qualities. I like that you can get a portion of several different meats instead of having to by each meat separately like at most Chinese take out. I also appreciate the cleanliness, and generally friendly employees I've encountered throughout my 3 experiences. Whether these aspects will bring me back to Panda Express in the future remains to be seen."}
{"text":"Bad location. 45 minutes before closing and they stop cooking. I went there three times and each time left and went to the one on 75th were they had no problem cooking fresh food"}
{"text":"Always a good meal. Employees are always professional and friendly. Been here for the largest lunch rushes and they always handle rush properly. Food is great."}
{"text":"The Walnut Shrimp was decent, but the Orange Chicken and Fried rice were about as bad as it gets while still being edible.  $10 for lunch with no drink.  You can get more, better, cheaper, and more convenient 'Chinese' food elsewhere.  Inside Red Rock Casino.  It's pretty much the first thing you run into after walking in the entrance from the parking lot."}
{"text":"Superior customer service! Always greeted warmly and with a smile. They even went out of their way to bring my food to the car one evening when I couldn't get out of my car. I like to give credit where credit is due, so I called the manager to compliment him on his staff, but also wanted to share this with Yelp. I believe in acknowledging excellent customer service when I receive it. Sadly those moments are few and far between, but it only makes establishments like this one shine even more!"}
{"text":"I usually understand that Panda is full, but I came in this time and left completely unsatisfied. The place, first of all, was not clean at all. There was wrappers and crumbs everywhere, and was difficult for me and my girlfriend to find a table to sit at. It took them 5 minutes of me standing next to the register for them to notice that I didn't have my food yet, and to top it off there was A ROACH ON THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT AND NO ONE DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT. Again, very understanding of the popularity of Panda Express but not an excuse to keep a place unsanitary as this one."}
{"text":"I like Panda Express but went to Fairview Park/Westlake location at lunch today and watched a worker who brought her 2 very young kids to work and sat there with them for 40 minutes while the children played loud and obnoxious electronic toys. Several customers were wincing and making comments about the noisy toys, but to no avail. A male companion also working there (would appear to be the kids father) came over and sat with them and ate lunch. The two parents (who I would guess must be the managers) went back and forth behind the food line and never washed their hands after playing with kids, rubbing their heads, brushing their hair, using cell phone, eating. Sort of ugh. Noticed no one there wears gloves. I'll eat at Panda Express at other locations but will skip this joint."}
{"text":"If you don't care about quality Chinese food panda is the place... I don't mess with meat there"}
{"text":"Great spot for great fast food on the strip.  Friendly service.  Place can get busy at times so patience is needed.   Ample parking in rear.  Free drink for pro drivers"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service and great fast food gets my five stars.  Opens early at 10am!"}
{"text":"The server was very friendly and greeted me as I entered, and was then very thorough thru the order asking me if there was anything else I would like. Excellent customer service in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Fast service, clean place, friendly stuff, good food and my fortune cookie contained a pleasant message."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Panda Express because well, Chinese Food. I waited in the drive thru line for about 30 minutes because the line inside was spilling out the door. Silly me thought that the drive thru line would be faster. I ordered off of a very small menu with not many options. What kind of Chinese restaurant doesn't sell soup of any kind?? I ordered the chicken and mushrooms with steamed brown rice and the Firecracker chicken with Chow mein noodles for my husband. When I got home, his meal was almost unrecognizable because all the chicken was under a pile of noodles. Mine ONLY had the rice...They forgot to put the chicken and mushrooms into a chicken and mushrooms meal!!  It was a very, very unimpressive experience."}
{"text":"This location is whatever, the rice was not good and one of the works was a little rude clearly doesn't look happy with her job( Riz) . Won't be back to this panda location."}
{"text":"Served promptly. Food was cooked fresh. Wait wasn't long. I prefer it hot so I appreciate the quality of entrees."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars because it's up to the standards of every other Panda Express out there. No better or worse.   Don't really understand the haters. Panda has a tight formula they follow at all their restaurants."}
{"text":"Panda express is my favorite fast food. This location has fresh food so we are always happy. It's also the closest Panda to our house. It was pretty cool to spot Andre Agassi there once"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Panda Express, and I never have problems here. This place has the best food, for sure. Great servive and no one is mean ir impatient!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Panda when I craving it...however this particular location can get busy at times. I came here recently (more like last weekend) and I order 2 entrees to-go and they were low on chow mien, fried rice and orange chicken. I had to wait at least 15 mins just for the chef to cook up some fresh food (which was fine...I rather have fresh than old and crunchy chicken)  I would recommend NOT to go around dinner time (6pm-close) because they are super busy, expect to wait for at least 15 mins for some more food and they have only one chef in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Maybe don't advertise that you close at 11pm on Saturdays and then block the entrance with furniture at 9:30 to signal to people you're closed instead of turning off the \"open\" sign? If it was half an hour before closing I would understand but an hour and a half? Come on. I work in the service industry too and I would be fired on the spot for that. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean place! Food was good. I ordered 2 orders of pot stickers and cream cheese rangoons. They didn't have it all ready so they made more and employee Crystal (very nice girl!) gave me a free drink while I waited! How nice"}
{"text":"Super clean and the food very tasty, i usually  dont go to this kind of restaurants,  but this one  is amazing, thanks  to Veronica and Savannah and the cooks of course"}
{"text":"I was told the KITCHEN was closed forty minutes before closing and that they would not be refilling their empty bowl of orange chicken. The most popular item in the restaurant. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? And every time I've come here in the past, I'd have to wait FIFTEEN minutes for their orange chicken because the bowl was empty again. As if they were waiting one me to signal to them they need to do their jobs. What a JOKE of a franchise. Thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Panda is my favorite go to fast food restaurant. Every time I think of the honey walnut shrimp, my mouth starts to water. So good. So clean. Doesn't feel like it's fast food. Doesn't make you feel like crap after either."}
{"text":"At Lake Mead & Buffalo location today...All was good, based on the crowd -your staff was friendly & efficient! Nothing comes to mind to change. Greeted with a smile & all staff were hard at work to refill the empty food options as quick as possible."}
{"text":"Botched my online order....said they didn't have an online order. Had to contact my bank and deny online charge. Reordered in restaurant when I went in to pick up and they were out of what I wanted. Manager/owner working drive thru with headset on was short with us as he was trying to do drive thru and restaurant....can't do both bro, you came off as though you didn't care. Henderson panda from now on...if in fact, at all. No more app, no more BC panda."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on our way back to Las Vegas from the Hoover Dam. It was right off the highway and very easy to find. The staff was pleasant  and greeted us as soon as we walked in. They was no line and we so we ordered right away, the food was fresh and good. The place was very clean."}
{"text":"It's not the best Panda Express I've ever been to, but it's not the worst either. They often run out of food during busy times and you have to wait until they finish preparing the next batch. This is generally not an issue, but when you are in a rush on your lunch break it can be a little bit annoying. Fortunately the friendly staff somewhat make up for it. They will often give a free drink if you have to wait for the food to be prepared. The food is typical Panda Express food."}
{"text":"Chinese New Year is always great at Panda Express! Cindy C. took my order & made sure my three entrees were warm and packaged with no leaks. I even got a red envelope with coupons inside good for a free entree and soft drink. Happy New Year Panda Express and thanks!"}
{"text":"I have not been to a Panda Express in a long time- over a year. I love their orange chicken and chicken with string beans with noodles. Service is fast. Fortune cookie comes with your meal. My 2-entree meal with noodles was about $7. Was out the door in about 4 minutes."}
{"text":"So this location is clean and pretty roomy for Panda Express location, plus there's a tv.   We arrived here for lunch at 1115 ish, and stood in a short line. The Asian male that was taking the initial orders appeared to be new, due to his slow pace and lack of communication with co-workers. The two Hispanic looking females were efficient and should've moved the new guy to a different spot maybe to the cashier spot or wipe tables something else. Let this new guy learn after the lunch crowd has moved on. That's just my opinion as a customer.  By the time I finally got to order, the mixed veggies were almost out so he set my plate aside until more veggies were made, cool. But for some reason I don't think the cooks heard him because other orders after mines started to pile up and my plate got mixed in with the next guys order. Luckily they write your order on the box but it caused some unnecessary confusion and slowed the line down. After that I wasn't even hungry nor did I want be inside of there anymore.   Oh and because of the lack of communication I still received the old veggies."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here. Dania was awesome and made some great recommendations, the food was fresh and tasted great, and the price for the food is decent. I got a complimentary drink while I waited as well. Dania, you're awesome!  No complaints, only compliments."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to this location.  I wanted to eat vegetarian, but they did not have anything with Tofu - just meat dishes.  So I had a bowl with white rice and Beijing Beef.  It was good, but I like my food a lot hotter in terms of spiciness.  I also had two Spring Rolls, which were very good.  Service was excellent.  Prices are a bit high for what you get, but not too bad overall."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru, ordered cheese Rangoon. Pros: -drive thru didn't take an extraordinary amount of time. Then again, there was no one else in line. Cons- - It was disgusting. The wonton bits were fried crispy and nice but the bottom part that holds the filling was not fried done so was chewy and gross. The cheese filling is bland and also yuck. You get 3 pieces for $1.95 with a dipping sauce and fortune cookie which isn't a bad deal if they were edible. I ate 1 and threw the rest in the garbage. The sauce also was very weird. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Poor customer service at this location every time...employees have a consistent frown on their faces. They Don't even bother to put utensils for a carry out order unless you ask."}
{"text":"A very good Panda.  Clean, friendly, line moves fast. Not a Chinese guy in the place. Open late, which is nice. I eat here often, it's never been a bad experience."}
{"text":"Can I give ZERO stars???!!!! PLEASE???!!! I cannot tell you when the last time I've walked out of a restaurant was... Oh wait! Yes I can!! It was yesterday at this Panda Express. Why did I do that you ask? Well for starters, the person who was supposed to be serving the food was OUTSIDE in the parking lot talking with a fellow employee instead of at her station. I only know this because she was walking in and heading to the food counter as we were walking out!  AND SHE DID NOT WASH HER HANDS once she got back there (I could see her through the window)!!! The cook (Asian woman who was actually management) never said a word to us although we were standing there waiting for several minutes. Not a \"Hello.\", or \"Someone will be with you shortly.\"... Come on! Seriously?  Why is this location open for business?  I'll go to the Val Vista location or Southern from now on. This franchise/corporate location didn't get my $$ that day... And they never will."}
{"text":"Bad service in drive thru. Really no unsweetened ice tea. First time she wouldn't get the tea from the inside line. When I said I was always able before. She finally got it for me. For a month I'm told they are out. Same girl. Got a guy one time who said we get deliveries on Tuesday. Still told all they have is sweet. This shows no respect to service a customer. I would like to continue going there but they don't care about my business."}
{"text":"What a surprisingly great experience. Have been driving by this place on my way to Pittsburgh for years and decided to stop today. Great food and great service. Will defiantly eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this location! We are regulars here. The staff is great! Food tastes good. Kids meals are $5. Healthy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but served small portions and there was no beef in my beef broccoli plate. So disappointed !"}
{"text":"After a long boring day i go to panda!  Three different entrees were ordered and I must say all of the food came out hot and great! the orange chicken was perfect nice and fresh not too spicy. The rice was crispy and fresh and there was a great rice to veggie portion. The black pepper chicken was nicely prepared not to much pepper.  The meals were great and I would recommend this joint to anyone in the mood for Chinese food! Oh And the staff was great. Friendly fast and filled with laughter and smiles. The male staff were all good lookin too; plus for the ladies and the female staff were cute as well; a plus for the men."}
{"text":"I just got out of class and I was very hungry so I stopped by Panda Express. It was about 30 minutes to closing and everyone was working hard to close up shop but as soon as I walked in they immediately greeted me. Service ... A+ The food was still hot and yummy and even though it was so close to closing I wasnt being served the \"last leftovers\" Food ... A"}
{"text":"Horrible service on 2/24/18 and the food was under portioned, cold (I am a chef and checked the temp when I opened it when I got home, I live less than 1 mile from the store) it was 93F right smack in the danger zone. We spent $53 for my family to eat and I just tossed it out as there was no idea how long it was under 140F. This is the 3rd time I have had food safety/quality issues at this store. I contacted the store but no one answered the phone after 4 attempts I gave up. I attempted to contact Panda Express via their website page using the contact us form but the form failed to load through after I filled it out."}
{"text":"Came here today around 4:45 PM and waited 40 minutes for my food. IN THE DRIVE THROUGH. They made me pull forward and park. So upset and to top it off they didn't even get my order correct."}
{"text":"Not anything against this Panda Express but I don't know why I keep eating there. Their(I'm guessing whole of panda Express franchise) food is mostly oily and the meat is just dipped in sugar. Just like they mentioned in Rick and Morty. But good for maybe a very rare occasion. Their best item is the orange chicken as everyone says thought, so that is worth trying out."}

{"text":"As a vegan, I have very few choices when it comes to fast and easy food. This location is on my way home after the gym - so brown steamed rice and steamed veggies is a go-to for me. These people cannot get this order right and I have recently given them 3 final tries. I complained when I got fried rice (with egg), the manager made it right with a free follow up (which was correct) but the last two times I end up with fried rice (with egg) even after being asked steamed or fried and stating IM A VEGAN....and my fortune cookies were all busted up this last time. Im too tired to even call the manager again. I have decided to write here and warn others - these folks are unmistakably morons. Go down the street to Pei Wei (Sunset and Stephanie)-  You're Welcome!"}
{"text":"Don't order the broccoli beef-  it's almost all broccoli.  Seriously, three TINY pieces of meat and LOTS of broccoli.  Not worth the $$.  The orange chicken is pretty okay.  Try Tott's Asian Diner a mile west on McClintock and Ray.  Their food is SO MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"fuck the manager, doesn't do shit but watch his employees fail. the cooks sweating in the back while they touch their faces and begin cooking agian. no one wears gloves. and it took 15mins to have teriyaki ready."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 1/2 dozen times and the food has always been Luke warm . I think today was my last time at this location."}
{"text":"Went to the Panda express to get a quick bite to eat.I had the Angus steak and noodle were undercooked right before I got home stomach started to turn up side down .Had to find a restroom fast gave me the runs. That the first and only time going to this place!!!Had some left-over dropped it in the trash when I made it home."}
{"text":"They say they open at 10 o clock am and it's now 10 mins past and I asked her how much longer until they open and she said ten minutes.  That's horrible service. So if your hungry don't come here. And they didn't even have white rice.  How do you open and jot have the food ready."}
{"text":"First time I have ever been here....since moving from out of state I have had a hard time finding a place with Chinese food that I like. Not only did everything I  ordered taste great....the chicken that I got (orange chicken and Kung pao chicken) were both spicy...which I love! Lo mein was also fabulous. I will definitely eat here again! Yum!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I order \"chicken with mushroom\", I mean CHICKEN WITH mushroom. When a guest wants black pepper chicken, they want black pepper CHICKEN. Not black pepper onions and celery. I had about 20 mushrooms in my tiny container, and maybe 8 pieces of chicken. The veggies on the black pepper covered almost the entire bottom of the other side of the to-go container. Not sure if you only do this to drive thru people, but rude. (And yes, the chow mein has WAY too much cabbage in it.) Prices are constantly and consistently going up all over, so stop shorting your customers what they're paying more money for, please."}
{"text":"Slow drive thru, took 20 minutes .....asked for half & half chow mien and rice, when we got home, we see it was all Chow Mien"}
{"text":"Orange chicken from Panda Express is our family favorite. We always have to take home a small bag of fortune cookies. The employees were friendly and quickly got us our food. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went in tonight at 7:20 PM. There was no rangoons, egg rolls or spring rolls. Asked for rangoons and the girl at the register asked the young man in charge of the kitchen if he could make some. The young man, Daniel, did not seem happy about this request and stormed off to the kitchen. I asked if it was too much trouble to cook them and I could tell it was even though they don't close for another hour and a half. Daniel came out of the kitchen and slammed the box of rangoons on the counter and opened it and threw some in the fryer then walked away. I got so irritated with Daniel's poor attitude I told them not to worry about it. Daniel later explained he wanted to get the kitchen closed soon (UM YOU ARE STILL OPEN FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF?) Then as I am being rung up I notice the total is about $3 more than it should be, check the receipt and see that I was charged for fortune cookies!!!!! I asked the cashier and she explained this was new. My fiancé went back in for a refund on the cookies as they are not worth even a penny lol and no one knew how to do a return. He had to grab the manager who was next door at the subway to come show her associates how to do their job. Horrible customer service.... Hoping food is at least good but previous reviews are not promising lol."}
{"text":"Food was old and gross!! Tried to call to complain and they won't even answer their phone! Don't waste your money!! Yuck yuck yuck!!"}
{"text":"Reviewing Panda Express. The trays were dirty at the beginning of the order line, the one I selected...had sauce on it which got on my hands. Dirty tables, dirty floors and the whole thing just gave me the creeps. These folks definitely need to get some management in there and clean up their act for sure."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. Some days they are on point, other days not so much. Why do I keep going back? Because the great days are almost worth the disappointment of all the others. Sweet fire chicken + Angus steak is a winning combination... on the good days"}
{"text":"Don't go after 8. 3rd time I've come after work and the workers are either lazy or don't care... maybe cuz they just wanna close. But man, 3 times I came and got a panda bowl and it's just above half way full. Same worker Sonia too. The third time I had it and asked if it's suppose to be so empty and they're excuse was they're strictly told to... what? These bowls ain't cheap. I'm \"strictly\" not gonna pay for half a bowl."}
{"text":"The seating at this location is weird. There are not enough tables for parties over 5, and the one table that is available, is always taken up by one random person.   We walked in around 2pm and it wasn't too busy. There was five people in our party and the employees quickly looked at each other when we walked in and they muttered something.  The girl taking our orders was clearly not having a good day. She got us through the line quickly and didn't say a word.   The tables we did find were dirty. They were all covered in crumbs and the floors as well.   My orange chicken was soggy. My friend ordered white rice and they gave her fried rice.   I've been to better locations."}
{"text":"We came in the evening so not much of a wait time. But the kung pao chicken I ordered and waited for was very salty and not spicy at all. The staff was friendly and attentive. The taste is not as good as it used to be must be the change in the kitchen all time. New faces everyone I come in."}
{"text":"I like this location not just because it's close to my house, they are friendly,fast and food is fresh. I have walked in other Panda Express and looked at there food and thought how long has this been sitting. Not at this place, fresh fresh one more time fresh food. Plus outdoor sitting on the side of the building and not in front where everyone pass you. Your tucked away"}
{"text":"As the 'boys of summer' say...three strikes and you're out. I am done with Panda Express. This particular restaurant being the worst of the worst. Tried the 'raved about' Chinese Spare Ribs....they were burnt to a hardened crust, full of fat, didn't 'fall' off the bone, had to be cut off with a very sharp knife. Absolutely awful. Had the 'Sweetfire Chicken Breast'. There were several pieces of fried batter and I almost broke a tooth when I tried to eat it (silly me, I thought it was CHICKEN). Barely enough chicken to feed a child, much less an adult. So basically, I paid over $8.00 for fried rice and a fortune cookie. Third visit to this store....last visit to any of them."}
{"text":"My hubby and i always eat here on mondays its my day off usually :) the food is usually good and the service is only good if the lady takes ur order.   The only bad service we feel we have is when the manager serves us our order he is very sloppy and we feel like he always has preference  and he served our to go in really small portions we saw he served the ppl behind us and he overfilled his plate...   Now im not asking to overfill my plate but all im saying is be fair with everyone we all are paying for our meals!!!!!   The restaurant is clean like i said usually the ladies working here are the best at serving !!!! Just a tip!!!"}
{"text":"Place was trashed and I'm not just saying this every single table had food and or trash on it and I think the toilet over flowed because it smelt like it my gosh and I really do like the food I don't eat out really but when I do it's  panda"}
{"text":"Bathroom they just put  the paper towels on top of the dispenser the trash cans are full the floor is disgusting they have definitely earned a two star review Taylor the lady at the cash register was completely snobby and rude as I came out to the cash register she looked right at me and walked away the manager was great I really appreciated his professionalism if I was Taylor been hated my job so much I wouldn't work there"}
{"text":"UGH! I usually enjoy Panda love the honey shrimp.  Usually I'm good because that item is cooked fresh UNTIL....  When I got to my hotel room the shrimp was okay but I ordered steamed rice. And the rice were actually hard stale rice balls. So I end up not eating any of it because if I thought one item was sitting then what does it says for everything else.  I was left out of food not to mention  expensive airport food."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place a 2 1/2 but that's not possible... Lady getting us our food (Evelyn) gave off a bad vibe and made my friends and I uncomfortable by her negativity.. this was not the experience I had hoped for since panda Express is one of my favorite places.. guess I'll just go to a different place next time and hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Bad service . I walked in 925pm and was told they close at 930p when in fact they closed at 10p. I was told that they will not be making any fresh food and all we have left is whats out on the heat warmers . I come to this place once a week as I work in the same parking lot . I know they close at 10pm . I was given horrible service and the food was old and not fresh. Gina T who helped me gave terrible service and said they will not make any fresh food as it's closing time. I have not been treated so bad as I did last night . I called and was told Sabrina the general manager is off today and will call me back . I will be waiting to get that call ."}
{"text":"My brother had never been here and I said he had to try it before someone jumped it on him. I think Panda used to be pretty good. recently, as in the last year, their food seems to be terrible - soggy and flavors are garbage.  If you are just dying for Chinese food, then go for it. If you want somehing more real, then go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Going to Panda I never expect much, but this place has the worst food.  This place is in the back of casino at the shuttle bus stop, a small corner \"food court\", along with 3 other names."}
{"text":"Panda Express is amazing. They just comp'd me this entire meal, gave Mojave High School $814 worth of free entree items reward vouchers for our kids, and confirmed to donate $290 worth of extra food for our student recognition luncheon. Edgar Valencia is an amazing store manager with a BIG heart for kids. I appreciate his support and all he does to get our kids on track for post-secondary education and GPA improvement. I am a very satisfied customer and we look forward to working with Edgar on a collaborative basis for community outreach."}
{"text":"It's ok. I do have some constructive criticisms though. So, I got:  The plate so two entrees plus one side: I got two of the same entree bc I was in Baltimore a few years ago, near Jessup I think, and there was a Panda Express there in a strip mall across from my hotel. The hotel was a Holiday Inn and they had a great breakfast buffet btw. Anyway I went there like 5 times which is really saying something bc the way it's set up its a real bitch to get there from across the street bc \"to make a Left you have to make a Right\" sort of deals.  The Beijing Beef is my Jam. So I got two. I chose the Brown rice as my side. Ik ik lame. But my tummy has been nauseous so I figured to balance the medium spice in the beef rice would be best. I was right. The brown rice was actually cooked perfect. I work at an Asian place so I'd know. The portion is very small though. I can't imagine what the single plate would have looked like. Other than that great.  I also got the veggie spring rolls, not good, tasteless and mushy. I've yet to have a good veggy spring roll. It's always the same, tasteless and soggy. Which makes me think they've been frozen at some point.   I also got the cheese Rangoon, actually pretty good I liked these it's 1.90 per app but they're smaller like a bento I like that too. The dipping sauce, which btw spring rolls came with no sauce, no soy either, was different there's like a flavor of idk mango or pear idk but it's not bad, just different.   The drive through took awhile, but the cashier/order takers was nice, I said I needed to look at the menu I'd never been there before, the menu differed from the one in MD, and she was nice asked if I had questions.   Pros: nice service, good main entree, rangoons, accuracy of order  Cons/Suggestions: veg spring rolls are yuck, portions are too small, no side sauces (Americans need sauce that's a fact of life), drive thru speed could be quicker, Add desert (fortune cookies don't count), Expand menu Mains"}
{"text":"This was the worst Panada inside a Vons I have ever seen.  The fried rice seems like it had been sitting there for hours.  There was only 1 egg roll (even though they are supposed to be sold it sets of 2), no wantons and the orange chicken looked like it was made in the morning.  Plus maybe the prices are higher here or they went up, it was over 8 dollars for a 3 entree meal, but I was willing to pay had it not looked so bad.  Pretty sad when frozen chinese food was better looking."}
{"text":"My chicken was not cooked right. The people are very nice and friendly. The restaurant is very clean. I seem to always get bad chicken meat from here.  It's always over or under cooked.  Price is good and people are friendly."}
{"text":"Just like I remembered it. Crispy, sweet, tangy, and slightly spicy orange chicken. There is a reason why so many people love the orange chicken at Panda Express.   If you've had Panda Express when it was in your nearby mall, you'll notice that not much has changed with the food. For newbies, Panda Express is super fast Chinese food. All dishes are prepared in the back and displayed on a steam serving table for you to pick whatever you want.   I found the food here to be enjoyable and very consistent with my past experiences with Panda Express. The service, however, could use some improvement. There were a lot of workers behind the counter and the ordering process was very unorganized. Despite this, I will probably be back for the orange chicken."}
{"text":"This location is always busy. But the customer service side sucks. You can tell if the food is fresh or not, and in my case it never is. Stale tasting. The ladies behind the counter are always rushing you, and barely speak English."}
{"text":"Had Chow Mein noodles this time they was a little dry. The almond shrimp was really good.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Panda Express in town. I had a problem with my credit card & debit cards, but Dejah fixed it perfectly & professionally. Marie, Stacy & Sheila were very nice & fast & took care of me + my daughter. Thank you all, especially Dejah!"}
{"text":"I like Panda Express in general - it is some of the better \"chain\" Asian food in my opinion. But after eating here today for lunch, I got a really hard MSG crash. My coworker reported the same thing. The only thing that will really make me crash hard like this and desperately want a nap is MSG. Service was really slow today (Monday @ lunch). I had went to this location about a week ago on a Saturday and service was much better, and no MSG crash. I'm sure Panda Express will deny they use MSG, but I'm certain they do.  My favorite dishes are: the veggie spring rolls and the Beijing beef, though I think the spring rolls might be the MSG culprit."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here fairly often as I work in the area. Consistent quality and the service is way above average for a fast food place. The reviewers that complain about the food quality are off base at this price point. This is a fast food place. The staff here is always fast and polite and try to help anyway they can."}
{"text":"damn, I just got ripped off.  went thru the drive-thru at around noon, got home and realized that what is usually fresh orange chicken is last night's left overs, heated up.  the first nugget I bit into was so hard, I cracked a tooth.  I wish I had another $10 to go spend at el pollo loco.  FML, shouldn't have trusted the PANDA today...."}
{"text":"Very good service at this location.  I took my class of special needs students on a field trip here to practice money and social skills.  The servers were very patient with my students.  They allowed the students to take their time and make choices.  The cashier allowed my students to take their time paying as well.  Panda express also offers some really cool lesson plans for Chinese New Year online--free for teachers.  We went in because of the free resources they offer online."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Panda Express I've ever been to. I've been here a few time and every single time, it takes FOREVER to get the through the drive thru. I've literally sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes waiting to order then another 15 minutes to receive my order. I've ordered the steamed vegis twice and both times they were brown and soggy. Also, the rice always tastes as if it's been sitting out all day. I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and tasted very fresh considering it was after lunch time"}
{"text":"Avoid this location .. employees are slowww and very stingy with the food.. Paid $9.55 to have the Pacific shrimp... the girl serving gave me mostly vegetables ..you have been warned.."}
{"text":"Ok, it is bad enough when they can't get your order correct, we ordered a two item and they gave us three. We ordered the String bean chicken and we got orange chicken. They were out of chow mien  and when they finally made some they served everyone ahead of us and made my wife and I stand and wait for 35 minutes!. I didn't complain  but when you are mistreated and ignored and everyone ahead of you helped then it is just plain bad service! Itzel the employee was the lady that likes to ignore people."}
{"text":"I've had this before and it was great. However recently the veggies are undercooked, the chow mein is undercooked, the meats are still good. My boyfriend got chicken teriyaki and it was great. The staff were nice and apologetic. Hopefully, on my next visit it will be better."}
{"text":"Came here with a huge group of church friends from CA and the food was fresh and well stocked. The servers gave us good portions for our to go plates and were really nice to our group of 18 people. Over all the please was clean and the bathrooms were as well. I liked their orange chicken a lot it was really juicy"}
{"text":"Good food the girls work really hard. Guys in the back too. But for the love of god lower the AC it's hot in here! I can't imagine how the guys cooking feel."}
{"text":"Ordered Teriyaki Chicken and was told it would be a 10 minute wait (which is ridiculous for \"fast\" food). I would've declined it, but we came to Panda specifically for that dish. So we said we'd wait. My husbands food sat out, getting cold, while we waited closer to  15 minutes. In the meantime the one person in the kitchen was openly just standing there on their phone.  It was infuriating to know we were waiting for food while someone was just standing there playing on their phone.  Super unprofessional."}
{"text":"Okay, so I am a sucker for Panda Express.  You may think it is not Chinese food, but I gotta tell you that their Orange Chicken is to die for.  The store at Thunderbird and 40th Street is fast (usually) and offers hot and fresh food.  Expect to stand in line (out the door) if you arrive between 5-6 p.m. on weekdays.  Overall, a quick place to get chinese food served fresh and hot.  My favs:  Orange Chicken, Chicken with Mushroom, and Mandarin Chicken.  Tip:  if you are on a diet, buy the kids meal.  It comes with one side and one entree, plus a cookie and a drink.  Give the cookie to your kid, order Ice Tea or Diet Coke, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty classic corporate franchise, 6 ppl in line, 1 person serving and 2 employees taking a break during peak time. Enough time for me to write this review while I'm standing in line."}
{"text":"Used the for a new years eve open house and my guests loved the food..I had orange chicken, mushroom chicken and walnut shrimp and chow mien noodles..excellent choice for a buffet."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. The plates are smaller as are their portions. The staff don't really speak good English. I used to go there many years ago. Today's visit was disappointing to say the least. The food is very bad. The service is lousy. I wouldn't feed this food to a family pet. You are better off going to PIEOLOGY next door . You can even go across The street to SMASHBURGER, BLAZE PIZZA, CAFE RIO OR CANES chicken. I would give it a half star. My opinion is this....my last visit to this place.  Fast forward to 2 Feb 2018,  I decided to give this place a second chance. I went there close to 9 PM to retry the walnut shrimp for my wife and I tried the 8 treasure chicken breast. When I walked in there were few patrons in the shop.  I had to wait over 10 minutes for the walnut shrimp as they were out of it. They finally made it when a staff member reminded the cook in the back that a customer was waiting on it. I also had to wait for the chow mien To be made. The shrimp was a little better, however the 8 Treasure chicken was bland and oily.  I truly believe that the quality of this food chain depends on the shop itself. For now I would only give you one star. I always  Like to draw my own conclusions and not be bought by a chain for a complimentary meal....This is my way of being honest and ethical on my reviews.  Please draw your own conclusions...."}
{"text":"Bad business model. Half of the items are not available during lunch. Attitude of employees is \"they don't care\". Poor service and only one item available to choose from. Suggest they get some adult supervision in here on the weekend."}
{"text":"Incompetent.   This Panda Express does not know how to manage their product. Waiting in line for one meal however they ran out of a particular item, ok wait is only two minutes to make, meanwhile the second item requested is available. In lieu of securing the second item its exhausted with persons in the drive through. First item is ready and the second item will now take 10 minutes. So I'm to understand I should wait while the first item gets cold?! Putting it back could be an option...wait for it...yes and by the time the second item is ready they'll be out of the other. Stupid is as stupid does as the famous saying goes...."}
{"text":"Ate here 2x yesterday! I had my boyfriend go and pick it up. Great food. Always see people cleaning, asking to help customers, and working like a team!"}
{"text":"I actually have been to this location a few times and have always had bad service. I decided to write a review after ordering drive through last night. First I was being helped by a woman who I had to repeat my duplicate order to a few times, then right in the middle of my third time a man came on. I placed my order. I was very friendly when I came up to the window although I wasn't greeted or even acknowledged. A woman took my card then gave it back, she then handed me my order.  All this without saying a word. I checked over my order and noticed something missing. I asked her about the bowl I ordered. She walked away, came back, handed me my bowl then closed her window. I don't blame her actions on her, I blame management."}
{"text":"After a really long day at work and not wanting to go home and cook, Panda is the perfect \"fast food\" choice. There are so many options you can make it healthy like my brown rice with veggies and mushroom chicken. Yummy! And the best part of all they at have drive through at this location!!! I didn't even have to exit my car for this fast and easy dinner"}
{"text":"Im giving this place 1 star because I have to. I've been here multiple times because it is the location closest to my house. I love Panda Express and have been eating the  food since I was a kid. I will NEVER come back to the location on Blue Diamond ever again. It's not because of the service which I've excused many times before because you can not expect much from a quick service restaurant but I got food poisoning from my recent visit. I ordered to-go a 2 item combo with Orange chicken and chicken and string beans. When I got home my food was room temperature at best. Except for my Chicken and String beans which were cold. Like they had been sitting out for over 2 hours untouched on the kitchen counter cold. I took two bites of it and was done. Now I know people say you don't know if it was the food...well I do. My boyfriend and I eat the same thing together every day. On this particular day he wanted something different. By midnight I had terrible food poisoning symptoms and he did not. 24 hours later I am ok but I will NEVER EVER eat at this Panda location again and I hope this review saves someone else from what I had to go through."}
{"text":"This location was horrible. Sorry but the noodles was dry and to top it off my fortune cookie was even stale.... not satisfied!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars I would, I would never recommend this Panda Express location to anyone I know. They don't give you a receipt when you use a credit card with a Station Casinos comp for the remaining balance and the employees are rude and inconsiderate. Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"The food was good as usual. However, there was a language barrier between the lady taking my order and myself. She couldn't understand my question about alternatives to fried rice and chow mein. #LostInTranslationInGilbert,Arizona"}
{"text":"If it were possible to give this place zero stars I would. I live very close by. Less than two blocks. My family will not eat from this location and we go all the way to Dana Park if we want Panda Express. I mean, were home in about the same amount of time if we go to the further location Bc this mckellips location takes SO LONG. They're always out of everything. The line is always out the door. The employees have no idea... they look permanently confused. I just don't understand why they wait so long to cook an item... why would you wait to be out of three things before sending someone to start cooking again. Like have some fore sight. There are literally always multiple people waiting for an item to cook so they can pay and get out of there.   Today we tried it again. Just because it's Sunday and we didn't want to go far. This time there was literally no one in line... they were still out of multiple entree items. We got the food to go, got home and it tasted bad. Panda Express tastes the same everywhere you'd think. No, today it was gross.   Honestly... this location is the worst. I think they'd be so much better if they had a good manager or shift leader."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Panda Express is YEARS, but I finally decided that I would answer my craving for some of that 'famous' orange chicken.  I was pleasantly surprised upon my entrance to see just how many options they had to select from. They even let you sample anything you want before making your final decision.  Ended up going with a 50/50 split of the rice & noodles (the noodles were better), orange chicken & Beijing beef. The beef was actually sweet and almost a little crispy, I really enjoyed. Other notable options were the honey walnut shrimp & the sweet fire chicken.   It definitely won't be years before I make my way back here again."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning on 6-14-15.  Had to call in sick today.  No bueno and no return trip there ever. Bummer...."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed! We waited like 20 minutes in the drive thru and the line wasn't moving, when we finally got to order I asked the staff what was happening why it was taking so long, she had an attitude and was super rude, she didn't say sorry or anything, so we had to drive out of the line without our food, because the line again continued to not move, so I googled the # for that particular store I asked to speak to the manager and I was told that the manager wasn't even there, the lady I spoke with was nice and apologized I told her what had happened and why I was so disappointed. What a shame! It's not fair to us customers!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy eating at Panda Express. We frequent the one on Stephanie because it is closest to our home. We are always greeted promtly and with a smile. Their food is always hot and delicious. Two thumbs up to the management team and employees. If you don't like waiting in long lines and paying ridiculous prices this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Happened to be my son's bday and what to do you know? His request is to take out at Panda and stay in to eat at the hotel while mommy and daddy have a date night and to gamble. Lol yay for us. Did some research and found a Panda right next to where we were gonna be at. A bit hard to find bc it was hidden in a small shopping center 2nd floor and even my local friend had a hard time finding it. But there's a small food court in the small strip mall by MGM and M&M World and this was there. Ordered about 4 combos to go. They had our usual of chow mein, Orange chicken, beef broccoli, fried rice and teriyaki chicken. Pricier than the usual Panda bc of location. But heard it was still good and fresh after taking out to eat at the hotel. They were satisfied and we were happy bday boy was content ;) Glad there's a Panda everywhere."}
{"text":"Muy muy mal servicio,tardan años en atender & para colmo cuando te atienden te dicen que ya no hay comida,mi pregunta es : ¿Porque no ponen los conos cuando ya no hay comida ? Así evitan el tiempo perdido de salir de mi casa."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 8pm and they were already out of chow mein and a couple main dishes.  They said that was it for the night. What they had left of the other options looked old and undesirable.   I got the teriyaki chicken and it was warm, not hot. The meat was fatty. The entrees there looked like something you'd see at a Chinese buffet. For $7 you're better off walking across the lot to Chipotle."}
{"text":"i always order online for convenience... well its never the case..i select a time and everytime i show up i still gave to wait and extra 20 minutes...and the steamed rice is always hard....so annoyed"}
{"text":"This location was horrible. I went in around 12:40 pm and they had no food. I ordered chow mien and it was all noodles. No veggies at all and you could tell how old and oily it was. There was no meat to choose from so I picked mushroom chicken and orange chicken. both tasted old. my orange chicken was hard like rocks. The cashier didn't even speak to me or greet me. A roll of toilet paper has more personality than her. and it looked like she was there alone. Ate here as a last resort but I won't be back. If I wanted old left over food I would've out of a trash can!!!"}
{"text":"Went in there this afternoon for two meals to go.  I witnessed Robert being as rude to one of his employees that I've ever seen. Robert, if you have a problem with this person, take it to the office! Do not!!!! Talk to your employees in such a matter especially when customers are watching. What an ass hole!!!!"}
{"text":"Had some pleasant experiences here, but also had 1 too many bad experiences as well. Most recent visit, drive threw was moving slow. I placed my order that I had to repeat couple times... lack of focus or not really good at multitasking. Anywho, after a good 15 minutes I get my food and find out my order is completely wrong! Very frustrating waiting in line just to receive the wrong order.   Called the number on the receipt and talked to a \"Manager\" of the store. The guy told me to come back and they will fix my order. I told him I'm on my way to work, it would be an even greater inconvienance. He insisted on taking my name for the next time I came in, for a meal replacement.   Pulled in the drive threw about a week and a half later. Placed my order and told the lady my name and my experience last time. Told her I talked to a manager and they have my name on a list or whatever. Lady goes to talk to a manager and looks at the list and my name was nowhere to be found. She had the nerve to ask \"am I looking to get a free meal?\" Because they don't see my name anywhere... I told the lady I paid for my meal that was messed up. I was told to come here and give a name and I would be taken care of.   I ended up leaving after she asked if I wanted to speak to a manager. I didn't have time to sit and argue with these people and tell my story all over again. Horrible Panda Express. Have not been to this location ever since. Keep the meal..... it's on me."}
{"text":"Nicht weiter zu empfehlen! Das Essen hat ehrlich gesagt so geschmeckt wie der Pappteller auf dem es serviert wurde. Nichts war durchgegart und der Preis absolut unangemessen. Der Stern gilt dem kostenlosen refill des getränks. Wenn man etwas für den schnellen hunger sucht, dann würden wir uns das nächste mal für etwas anderes aus dem foodcourt entscheiden."}
{"text":"Sitting in the drive thru now for 30 minutes for an Ala Carte broccoli beef this place may have just messed with my job so much for lunch hours"}
{"text":"Food is good though wish the place would little bit more clean so we don't have to take out always.i like panda express and go there 3 or 4 times a month.but today I am disappointed because the lady gave me little amount of honey walnut shrimp than usual.:("}
{"text":"I have been a Panda Express fan for years, most of the time the food is fresh and good. Last night I went in at around 9pm for Orange Chicken and Beijing Beef with steamed rice to go. The entrees were a bit hard, like they had been fried just a little too long or stale. The portions were a little more than what you would normally get which is good, and the servers were nice and quick, but it was a little rough chewing. Will try again on another day."}
{"text":"Jose was outstanding, allowing us to taste their new spicy pacific shrimp and general tso's chicken. You know what you are gonna get with Panda, so its hard to mess that up, food was fresh and hot, will be back, when I visit Vegas next time!"}
{"text":"Good choice for tonight's dinner. This location is usually busy, so the food is hot and pretty fresh! It's not so packed that getting food takes a long time. They work very quickly and efficient to get your order correct and get you on your way. Tonight we enjoyed some take-out!!! Orange Chicken, always, Kung Pao Chicken to give it that nice kick, n' a Chicken Egg Roll, w/Sweet n' Sour sauce to top it off :)"}
{"text":"Food is good but skimpy portions... Other Panda locations pack the Food in the panda bowls but there is clearly space between the lid and the food. There was only 2 Other customers in the place when I went."}
{"text":"The girl serving on Christmas Eve had less Christmas spirit than the grinch. Had a sour face. Attitude. Got my order wrong and then just poured it out the plate and tried to dump something else in and I walked out.  Complained to an employee as he walked out.  Girl has 0 customer service skills."}
{"text":"Panda Express admittedly tastes better when you've been eating American food an entire trip (and I'm not talking about Native American here).  It was okay as far as Panda Expresses go.  My gripe with the place is that the drivethrough is way too important for the servers.  As I waited in line (with one person in front of me and several behind me), I noticed that they fulfilled four drivethrough orders before even looking at the woman in front of me.  That to me seems like a bad serving strategy."}
{"text":"There is only one dish I would get at Panda and they screwed up that last night. The String bean chicken breast was bathed in a dark brown sauce, well actually swimming in the sauce. Since everything else looked inedible, I doubled up on the ole favorite. Bad choice as the salt really shone through and everything was lost in that brown mess. Chicken Breast was present in there, but ya know what else was lurking around: the string beans still had their tails on. How lousy are the chef's here to not be able to cut off the little things on the beans. Oh, now that is my job I suppose? Cheery front clerk was trying to upsell me everything in site, but I did give up all my change for 69 cent chocolate chip cookie and guess what - that was the best part of the meal and my fortune: \"When in doubt, let your instincts guide you\"    They were wrong last night."}
{"text":"Totally used to boycott all panda's due to their use of only dark meat. Now, I can finally go because they feature the white. My go-to dish is the String Bean chicken and I even tried a Black Pepper Shrimp dish that was shockingly better than in alot of Vegas dumpy Chinese places who forget to take off that fatty strip on top of the shrimp. I will walk out if the pan isn't more than 1/2 full and they need to work on the Fried Rice quality. I always get steamed rice and if you take 30 seconds for the phone survey, you get a free entree on your next visit. So, you still have to buy a two entree plate, but a totally free entree is yours on the side. Bejing beef had its moments, but next time either two egg rolls or that sweetfire chicken breast will be on the list. Welcome back Panda. In Vegas, you have choices, but traveling around panda is like gourmet in some small citiies, but each place deserves inspection before you chow down."}
{"text":"If I could  I would give negative stars. I'm ABSOLUTELY DIGUSTED. DON'T EAT AT PANDA (or at least this location) I stopped by this panda.. 10pm .. I ordered 2 entrees an a side.. they gave me two boxes. I thought it was odd. Upon opening the boxes once I got home. . I discovered that the second box WAS SOMEONE'S FUCKING LUNCH. Eaten chicken wings in a bag and a empty water bottle. This is so unbelievably unsanitary and disgusting I will never eat here again. Pictures for proof."}
{"text":"I just went to the Panda Express on Southern and Stapley to get one of their boba teas it is 1015 in the morning and they are open & like coffee drinkers I like tea in in the morning. I went through the drive thru I placed my order went up to the window and was told none of their Teas are  brewed...... and that's it. They did not tell me how long it would be if I wanted to wait they didn't offer anything and I feel if you're open for business you need to have everything available or make up for it not just tell me sorry no teas are brewed and shut the window. If you're a business and you have open and close hours that means when your open you should have everything available and when you close it means you should close at the time that it says and not 20 minutes early. I am so bummed about this place because this is my third chance I've given it and each time was horrible the time before this one I had to give them my order literally 7 times in a row because she kept deleting it ."}
{"text":"So glad this wasn't my first panda express experience. Ice machine broken, no changing tables for babies, food tasted like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for several hours, soda area disgusting and lids all covered in sticky soda, every drink was flat. Im sure there were more problems but im just glad i didn't experience any more than this."}
{"text":"Ew, Panda Express is actually really bad. Half of the orange chicken they gave me was all weird and had that goopy and weird... The noodles where greasy for some reason...? Idk if it was just this location but it wasn't very good. Other panda's are better..."}
{"text":"some workers are nice...however the cashier needs to be fired...plenty of good ppl looking for work...an where are the fortune cookies asshole"}
{"text":"Was exceptionally clean! Major problem- when we went in at 11:45 am for lunch- food trays were either empty or half empty- no customers in the store- the dishes that we wanted were not ready and had to make other selections for lunch..probably will not go back- due to the poor planning for lunch crowd!"}
{"text":"Horrible Shift Lead for closing shift. Azalia (shift lead) and Anna were attending our order for a while. We received half of our order at first. Apparently Azalia had family come in at the same time. As we were waiting for the other half of our order Azalia was firing up a conversation with her family after already giving them their food and ringing them up. Completely ignoring the fact that we were still waiting for our food. My mother had to ask her twice before actually receiving the rest of her order 10 min later. I simply asked Azalia for her name and as I walked away she started speaking to her family in spanish(assuming I wouldn't understand her) saying its her last day there and she didnt care if we left a bad review etc etc. Completely unconsiderit of the fact that we had already waited a good amount of time to even receive our order due to the fact that she was sidetracked by her family. As she was wiping down tables Azalia kept giving me dirty looks which made me extremely uncomfortable as I was eating. My mother made her aware that we were unsatisfied with the way they serve and treat their customers. Instead of bettering the situation she started raising her voice claiming that I had given her an attitude when I asked for her name and that she didnt care about our opinion. Ive never had such a hard time buying fast food."}
{"text":"For the \"fast food\" Chinese meal...food is tasty, but many times the drive through is slow! Many times the drive thru line is full of waiting cars or you may be asked to wait on a food item."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend before a movie, so the turn over on the food was fast, We both ordered two item entrees, and they were fresh hot and tasty. I know that Panda's have their ups and downs, but, this was very good for fast food."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times and for the most part the food is decent for fast food Chinese and service was decent not good BUT decent. BUT tonight, the service SUCKED!!!! There was a girl named Traci and WOW she was horrible!!!!  The way she took the order and couldn't understand simple English kinda makes wonder if she was dropped on her head a lot as a kid!    Couldn't understand my order and charged me for something I didn't order!  Wow! If I was the manager she would be gone gone gone!   If I see her again I'll walk out.  The food is not worth her attitude and stupidity."}
{"text":"We came here 1x so this is based on our first experience the food was fresh and they gave lots of food we were able to share 2 plates of 2 choices with 3 adults and 1 child.   It was clean and close to our new home . We just moved from Hawaii and we go to alot of panda express and this was the first Panda that I enjoyed."}
{"text":"I know it's panda and there's tons of them here, but seriously open 24 hours and it's near other eateries? Fantastic. It's constantly good food (notice I didn't say \"chinese\" food) that fills you when you're there. The reason for 3 stars is because:  - Service was ok, you can tell the people behind the counter hate their jobs.  - The Chow Mein was really cold..... thank buddha for white rice.  - And they didn't have chopsticks, or they didn't understand me.....  Anyhoo, midnight munchies; 2 blocks; 7 bucks; full tummy.  Enjoy the strip."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Panda Express when I'm in the mood for some quick Chinese food. However, the service at this location wasn't the best. They were slow and the lady who helped me and my friend was a little snappy."}
{"text":"Every  time I eat at a panda Express ,  no matter which location, city, am a happy satisfied customer,"}
{"text":"Got there at 8:55, and the door was locked and the employees were doing the international \"we are closed sign\". Stores operating hours are until 9... am I missing something here?"}
{"text":"I have been to this particular Panda Express several times and the offed has always been great. Not this time. The service was the same as always. I was offered to sample something. The server was friendly and I was through the line in just a few minutes. This time however, the food was lukewarm and that affected the taste greatly. I ordered half noodles, half fried rice. Tasted the same as always but was lukewarm. The orange chicken wasn't hot either and it tasted like it was over cooked and it was difficult to bite into. I also had the sriracha shrimp which also was not at the proper temperature. The last time I had it the shrimp was covered in a somewhat crispy batter. This time it was soggy. I might try this one again because this could have been only a bad night for the chefs but its no excuse. If its bad next time it will be the last time."}
{"text":"For a fast meal that doesn't involve fried food and unhealthy entrees, this is good. ...and out of the numerous Panda express locations that I have been to, this one is one of the best . It's always clean, the food looks fresh even at slower times of the day and the customer service has always been good here too. Great thing for a fast food type place!"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend 2 days ago. I had the black paper chicken with noddles. It was ok but far from perfect. The employees were not too friendly"}
{"text":"I went to Panda express and ordered double of my orders and I got single orders and the food is old not fresh. I called to see if they would give more and they told they won't do crap. I will never go there again. Terrible customer service and rude employees."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Panda Express for a quick fix for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'll have to give this an eh.  The taste of the food is fine.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the fried rice.  I've had much better at most other Chinese restaurants.  Other than that, the food isn't any better or worse than the hundreds of other Chinese places in the area.  One nice thing is that you can get it in a drive thru.  One thing that I did not like, and will probably be a reason I won't go back is that their pricing is screwy.  I pull up to the drive thru, and the menu board says Plate $7.70 and up.  So you pick two entrees, and a side, and you have no idea how much it's going to cost.  The menu board doesn't say.  So I order, and lo and behold, the price is now over $9.  What kind of bologna is that.  I want to know how much I'm going to spend when I order.  They could easily put add $1 or whatever under the entrees so you know how much extra you're going to be charged.    So really, I'd have to say the place is a bit more pricey than most other Chinese take outs, and a lot more than mall Chinese food.  I guess you're paying for the high priced real estate and convenience of the drive thru though.  I wouldn't say I would never go back, but I'd probably be more likely to just call the Chinese take out place by my house before I'd go back here."}
{"text":"After a long day of work I really just wanted some panda & to go home! I ordered a plate with half chow mein half fried rice & double kung pau & I'm pretty sure I got more vegetables then chicken in my Kung pau & I only got rice, no chow mein. I'll just stick to the panda on 51 Ave."}
{"text":"Ok so we get here 20 min before closing time and I know it must suck for someone to come right before you close but those business hours are there for a reason. To provide a service the entire time of your posted hours... with that being said this place didn't have everything available to us while here and than when I asked for something on the posted menu at the drive through they tell me it is no longer being served at this location. Needless to say that made me upset but when we asked for the potstickers they said they were out for the night. An item that takes less time to make than the time we spent at the window waiting for them to provide us with our food. Whatever happened to pleasing the customer? It is poorly ran and managed and someone was eating while in the middle of taking my order. I will not be coming here again and telling my friends to avoid this restaraunt for a better one."}
{"text":"Loved this place when it first opened! There was an Asian guy that was the manager, perhaps he was a store launcher, things were awesome but have progressively gone down hill since... We just left there & went to Steak & Shake because the Shanghai steak I always get looked like it had been sitting there 2 hours... we went at 2pm, so I get how that could have happened...  I also understand it seems they're doing what they need to to save money but I don't know if I'll take my chances going there... there has to be a a better happy medium to having the food I want to order and not breaking the bank... I gladly pay the premium price & would pay extra if they use asparagus in the recipe again"}
{"text":"A complaint.. They open at 9am and we come thru at 10 am and they dont have the full menu available.. We had a choice of 3 items.. No pot stickers or spring rolls!!  When u open a place of business you have everything ready!! We went from buying 2 3 entrees to 2 two entrees and no sides a loss of money for them but i guess they dont care. Then they pass us the food and a container opens in the bag! Might have to find a different location or go to local chinese restraunt that cares"}
{"text":"If I could do 0 stars, I would. Every time my family and I have come to this location it's dinner time or just before dinner rush. Every time they are out of at least 4-5 items and wait until someone has to ask for it to even START making it then nonchalantly say ok 5-10 minutes. Drive thru had people waiting for 15+ minutes according to their screens. Waited for an item and the customer that ordered after us, took the whole batch before we got ours and we had to wait again. Gave us the bag to leave and thank goodness I checked because the plate only had noodles and rice in it! Gave it back to them and they still gave us the wrong items. By the way, there was 3 people us included inside. Not swamped. The employee on register gave everyone the rudest look. Definitely giving up on this location I'd rather drive an extra 10 miles and get the right orders and decent service."}
{"text":"Outstanding food with fresh vegetables at a great price.  It is a shame that the staff is rude and condescending while people order.  I do not understand why they perform one task and stop while you wait for someone else to help you instead of helping the one guest from start to finish."}
{"text":"This is not authentic but it is delicious and fast! I have been through the drive threw and it is quick and easy and the staff is very friendly and cheerful!"}
{"text":"Att: mgmt the ladies working Sunday night were friendly and nice to talk to! I was the last customer and felt like the first.. will come back and expect that you have gave them praise"}
{"text":"Panda Express, national chain American Chinese joint that is generic, not very great, but hits the spot when you are drunk or having a craving for saucy fried food and bad rice.   The reason this place gets a 4 is because they are able to truck through the line of 30 that is there regardless of time of day relatively fast. I was pretty amazed at the professionalism of the staff. I watched as the poor young ladies behind the counter dealt with crazy Korean tourists who spoke no English, a group from the Middle East that spoke in broken English, a crazy couple who wanted to order stuff from the \"more expensive\" menu but not pay the price, and the rest of the line and they never ever were disrespectful or looked upset. They sincerely impressed me with their professionalism.  This place is right next to the CVS next to planet Hollywood on the second floor and the prices are a little higher than the ones in strip malls across the U.S.A but that is because it is on the Las Vegas strip, so what do you expect.   There is a significant amount of counter and table seating but it is always crowded so I recommend grabbing it to go and not fighting for a table. As I sat in line, I watched as diner ate like crazy wild animals and crap spilled all over the floors.  The young ladies came out and cleaned whenever they could, so they try to keep the place clean, but between the 5 year olds flinging noodles to tourists using chopsticks like plows, stuff is everywhere...  The food was hot, relatively fresh, and made my pregnant wife happy who was waiting in the hotel. So this is probably one of the best American Fake Chinese food places I have ever been, not because the food was great, but I can sympathize with the servers on the pain, and the fact they keep their composure is amazing.  Beware, it is more expensive than you are used to, but you can't help that being in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"**Derek with Panda - i don't see anywhere where i can DM you ***   Love Panda Express; however, this location is the WORSTS I've been.  Ordered On Line ( order # 15346021 ) & thought to try new Steak & Shrimp.  Walked in to p/u , went straight to counter.  Manager / Asst Mngr on duty, i'm guessing since she has diff color shirt on, didn't even bother to acknowledge.  For some reason she was more concern about chopping meat? to even ask if I needed help.  Waited maybe 5 minutes at counter - Thank goodness for Antonio finally asked if i need help.  The store wasn't even busy.  So kudos & good job for Antonio, but 1 star for Management on duty.  Need to revisit customer service training, just s"}
{"text":"Quality Service and Cleanliness is great here. The orange chicken is always must!!!  I miss the Mandarin Chicken but they have the new Teriyaki which is ok."}
{"text":"I frequent panda express, not this one, but Panda in general.  I decided to go to the Panda today for lunch.  I order a bowl, half rice, half noodles and vegetables.  When I opened my bowl, I was very disappointed.  The rice was overcooked so it was stuck together (eww) and the noodles had a burnt taste to it.  I should have read the reviews. Very disappointing, therefore I will not be back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't be writing about this if I didn't notice that 90% of Panda Expresses do this:  1 employee ratio per 10 customers = a disaster waiting to happen.  Please Please Please employ more people. It is not cool to wait 15 minutes to order, especially when it's fast food. I feel bad for the 1 employee that is supposed to get/make food and ring up 10 customers all at once. By himself. 1 person handling the drive thru alone is just cruel."}
{"text":"We love Panda Express! Our closest location is in summerlin , lakemead & buffalo I believe.  Unfortunately this location always disappoints.  Today it's that they didn't offer sauce for the teriyaki chicken. I normally will ask for it but I forgot due to the manners of the person packing my food. She wasn't friendly , she didn't smile. She didn't ask if I needed egg rolls or any other appetizer like food.  We did order a bigger plate . 1/2 fried rice 1/2 chow mein* Double fire chicken breast , & teriyaki chicken.  We didn't get offered to run a sample of their newer items at all.  But that's totally ok. It usually makes me want to upgrade to the shrimp or steak they offer for an up charge lol I always go for it! Lol  5 months pregnant & I love panda!   I asked for a couple plates & chopsticks & the register girl didn't seem friendly or smile at me either.  When I got home to eat our food , I noticed they didn't pack the teriyaki sauce leaves me sad .  & my fire chicken breast that is normally so amazing was soggy Also , found Plastic on our chicken ."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this restaurant, there's a long line at the drive thru. It takes me about twenty minutes or so, to get just a simple Panda bowl order. Yesterday, today and on previous occasions, it is always the same story; sit a the drive thru for a long, long time waiting for service. These workers are really inneficient and when someone's order is not ready (Often, that seems to be the case), they don't know (like other restaurants) to tell the customer to go wait on the side of the business in order not to hold off the line. Today, I saw at least one person leave the drive thru and I was about to do the same as well.  I'm about not to do business with this place anymore. They're going to start losing customers."}
{"text":"Just don't do it. Find a real Chinese take out place. I highly recommend Taipei South. I barely got a meal and it cost nearly $8. I would have gotten 2 delicious meals out of an order at any other place. Plus, it was awful. Never again."}
{"text":"Obviously there are more gourmet Chinese food restaurants around... but Panda always hits the spot for me.  The service is always speedy and friendly (at all of the many locations I've visited), and the food is pretty darn tasty.  The Beijing Beef and new Honey Sesame chicken are tasty, and you can't skip the chow mein noodles.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was very well prepared and the staff were very nice. The woman working Gabe me the choice between the last little left over bits of chow mein or waiting a few minutes for the new batch to finish which I was very grateful for.   The restaurant was clean and service was definitely prompt.   The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because the parking situation is a nightmare. I spent more time trying to get out of the parking lot than I did actually getting and paying for my food, including waiting begins the very large line ahead of me on the restaurant. Because of this I will unfortunately never come back to this location."}
{"text":"The restaurant is always clean and the service is fast. I have found the employees there to be very pleasant. Clearly they must like working there because they all seem to have the most genuine smiles.   For fast food I would say it's great. Whenever we want something quick we come here because it doesn't taste like we are eating fast food.   The parking situation is good.  No matter what time of day there always seems to be a place to park.   I would definitely recommend this location and this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I am updating my review, And giving 1 more star because I went again and cookie helped me she was much more helpful than before. Unfortunately The portion were still small and for some reason they closed half of the dinning are off at 8:30pm and the restrooms? when they close at 10pm? When I asked the other manager she said its because they have to prepare to close. I am sorry but we shouldn't have to suffer because you want to close early. Still have a long ways to go to get a good rating from me."}
{"text":"This place is always hit and miss we have ordered here a few times and you either get old food that has been sitting under heating lights or if your lucky you get crunchy noodles.  I would suggest maybe ask for fresh entrees and noodles but not sure how that would work as I am usually in a rush when I go here."}
{"text":"Contrary to what john thinks Kathleen was awesome! Also.. You can ask them for a fresh batch.. Who knew opening your mouth politely could reap such rewards!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pandas in charlotte. Keep up the good work. Sometimes a little loud but that's alright because I want them to have good business."}
{"text":"I honestly don't even know how people say \"best staff\" this Panda is pathetic I've came here for the past years and lately wow has it been bad. I've seen a couple of new faces and I've seen this lady that works there but I've seen her at different places she's the worst out of them all. I came at 9:30 with 30 minutes left yeah it was kinda late but you can't pull that as a major excuse my parents own a restaurant and you don't see us doing this. I brought 6 people with me not including me and we all got the worst service with them they gave us the death look and they weren't even responding do us just speaking in there language. We see that everything is gone literally everything and they didn't even manage to say we'll make new stuff or anything we just started laughing and we just ended up eating the trash that they gave us. By far the worst panda experience. Sorry I've never gave a review like this but they deserve it."}
{"text":"I know I'm not supposed to eat there but it's just SO good. All the beef dishes are amazing."}
{"text":"So far, I have not had a bad experience at this location. The staff I have encountered has always been friendly. The food is fresh (of course, I can only speak of the orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp) and taste like any other Panda Express. As many times that I have been at this location, I think pretty soon they will know my order before I walk in the door lol."}
{"text":"They jipped us on our portions. Yeah, the shrimp is extra, but they only filled the bowl half way with chow mein (including shrimp) same with the sweet and sour chicken bowls. Went in to get our money's worth and the only one who actually apologized for the mishap was the cashier. The manager doubted us and said that the shrimp only comes with 7 pieces.... which wasn't the issue. We got new bowls and our money's worth, which is greatly appreciated, but the manager at hand (small Hispanic woman) needs some more work done when it comes to dealing with customers. The cashier was more of a manager than the actual manager. No manager should argue with the customer when one of the workers make a mistake. She should correct it. This has never happened before at this Panda, they usually do better than this.  Update: Gave another try, cause everyone deserves a second chance. Alicia was packing it! She deserves a reward!"}
{"text":"Usually hit these up when I am in a mall or something. I know what to expect before getting there,  works for me, 2 entrees with brown rice, all the ice t I can drink and a fortune cookie. For the people who whine about this place chill out, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Under prepped for business flow. Been here twice at this location, always running out of food. They skip over you and help out of order if you have a large order or group. Very unorganized. Will go to different location and spend my money."}
{"text":"1 star because allen was stingy with my orange chicken.  This guy should stick to the cash register and not touch the damn food.  Even his co worker, Tony, looked at him weird. I would usually let this go but he hooked up some other people which made me feel like this was a personal issue.  After eating my 5 pieces of over priced orange chicken i had an earl.  Edit: Changed it to 3 star since tony attempted but failed to put a little more before allen closed the tray."}
{"text":"Long line. Only two people on service line. The place was a mess. Drink station dirty. Dirty tables. We ate in the restraunt. The saving grace was that the food was good. Sat there for 30 minutes. When the line went down. The manager picked up some trash and restocked the cookies and bottle drinks. Never touched the dirty tables. Several tables were dirty. Wuth dried up food on them. Even saw some flies on the table having a meal."}
{"text":"I remembered the food here being mediocre and I normally do not come here for Chinese food but I was in need of white rice and I did not feel like only ordering white rice from an actual Chinese restaurant.  I know what you're thinking...why don't you just cook rice at home yourself?  Sad to say, I am probably the only Asian person who does not know how to cook rice.  I know...way to fail at being Asian.  Anyways, the lady Jano helped me and her service was superb so I decided to get orange chicken, green beans and chicken, and chicken potstickers along with white rice.  All of the items that I ordered tasted better than I remembered.  I don't know if the stupendous service made me bias about the quality of the food or what but it's not bad for fast food Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Panda Express chain store I've ever been to. Every time I go here there's always an issue and they always have missing food. Whether it's rice, orange chicken, etc... and it has happened more than 5 times. I'm sorry but if u know your almost out of something, you do not wait til it's gone to start cooking it. They said it's 10 mins wait because they are cooking something else first. Come on now. Think about your customers yeah"}
{"text":"I eat here conservatively 5-7 times a week I'm a huge fan of Panda Express. This review isn't about the food which I love it's about this specific store and the service in the drive thru I just experienced. After messing up my order 3 times and still not getting the right order the girl in the drive thru talked to me like I was in the wrong and a 5 year old. I'm not sure if Panda is have issues with staffing but this person is making your store look very bad. I will continue to go there and I assume the problem will fix itself after enough complaints are made."}
{"text":"This location is horrible! Waited in the drive thru line for about 20 minutes till we got to the window. Once at the window, the girl was very rude and told us it was going to take another 10 minutes for our chicken or if we wanted to change our order, we could. No longer going to this location. There have been too many times that we have waited forever for our food!!!"}
{"text":"Be ready to wait 20 minutes literally in the drive through line. I'm so mad right now. I hate this drive through."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express. However, today was disappointing. I ordered beef and broccoli as one of the 2 entrees. When I got home from the drive thru, 11 pieces of broccoli and HALF a piece of beef. I have a crying 2 month old so going back is not an option right now. FAIL. I am giving you 3 stars since it's not always disappointing ..."}
{"text":"Such a disgrace . i have been to this location various times and thus far this visit was the most inconvenient one. I had to wait in drive throught for more than 15 minutes . then to look through our bag to find our food boxes broken which could have caused some sort of mess in my vehicle. Take note it was kids meals so it wouldve have definitely made some sort of disaster in my vehicle!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 10:20 A.M. It appeared as though only 3 employees were present, maybe 4. Many of the tables were dirty. They did not have String Bean Chicken. Other than that, the food was good."}
{"text":"I ordered while using the drive thru and it took more than 10 minutes to process my payment. I thought it was extremely odd that the cashier took my card,  disappeared for 5 minutes then came back to the window saying that the system shut down all of the sudden and they needed to reboot it.  After another 5 minutes passed by my card was finally given back to me and I was asked to park my car because my food was not ready. After another 5 -10 minutes we got our food which was cold.  It seems extreamly odd behaviour, especially since we visit this location often.  It was so odd that I took a picture of the cashier, will be monitoring my bank account and canceling the card that was used for payment."}
{"text":"Portion sizes have decreased while prices are the same or higher. Orders to go get more than orders for dine in because of different containers. Many items are low or missing or wilting or overcooked. Did not get a fortune cookie. I paid 12 dollars and I felt tricked trapped and fooled. You lost a customer. Have fun when the next financial crisis hits and your business gets absolutely eviscerated. I won't cry for you when your stores are looted and burned. #boycottpandaexpress"}
{"text":"So here is the dealio.... The staff are extremely friendly but poorly trained. They know their jobs, just have no idea how to handle a restaurant when getting busy. One single car was going through the drive through at a time. We have been here many times and they always screw up the orders. They always fix it without issue but come on, it is not like they are stupid. The food is pretty good but waiting almost 30 minutes in my truck outside is ridiculous. And having a 10 minute wait or longer for each item at 930pm.... What?!!? Also, no ice. How does that happen?    Train your people! They try so hard but have no guidance."}
{"text":"Service & Food here NOT GOOD! (and that's an understatement)  The very few times I have been here the employees don't seem to speak very clear english. I have to repeat myself several times before my order is understood. Then the people behind the counter are rude, they don't seem to care about being polite, and have a \"getto\" type of attitude with customers. Instead of \"Welcome\" or \" how can I help you\" it's \"whaddu want\" or \" what u geddin?\" If you ask about anything other than what is on the board like TV specials or special items - they have NO clue what you are talking about, and will stand their and look puzzled, then they will just tell you NO.   Worse Panda Express experience ever.. I will not go back to this location, I will go to the other location in Chandler....   Word to the Manager - Teach your Employees that Customers Service is #1 Priority.. Maybe even have them smile once in awhile, and say \"hello\" and \"thank you sir/ma'am\" would be nice...instead of the \"getto-fab\" attitude."}
{"text":"Customer service is always and I mean always bad here and the food is just ehhh also but I continue to go here for a bowl of white rice which that they can screw up."}
{"text":"Newly opened express Asian American fusion restaurant. A bit on the pricey side for the portion sizes. But it is a neat concept. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has definitely improved since opening. Employees finally seem to know what is going on. My last visit service was fast friendly... and above all ACCURATE"}
{"text":"Second time ever at this location and will be my last. It's lunch Tim and they are dead should have been the first sign of a problem, but ignored it and ended up with room temperature orange chicken and burnt fried rice. Last time I was here the rice was burnt then too, was hoping it was just a single bad incident but nope, two for two."}
{"text":"This was the worst service ever.  First they don't say high or ill be wish you in a moment while you wait for 3 minutes.  Then when they ring up the order the kid double entered my order causing the order to be twice the cost.  When I point it out he says it's right I explain the math and he says he doesn't do math the register does and it's right.  They Spencer the supervisor comes over to look and he gives me attitude because I'm upset.  He treatened me and said I could just leave.  He said he doesn't have to fix it because he is on break.  He refused to tell me who his manager was and said repeatedly he doesn't care because he is on break.  This person should not be in customer service ice let alone a supervisor of people. I refuse to return to this location since they hire people like this."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says; you haven't done Vegas until you've eaten at Panda Express on The Strip.  This location shares space with Chipotle and a no-name pizza shop, so it's usually bursting with tourists -- some who smell better than others.  Seating can be scant, but I lucked out on my last visit and somehow wrangled a single chair and small table.  The food was definitely Panda quality and I recommend their famous Orange Chicken and their newer Beijing Beef, which came along during the Summer 2008 Olympics.  Odd moment, though: at the end of my meal, a homeless man approached me and asked if I'd buy him dinner.  After I politely refused, he asked if he could finish mine (there was very little left).  I agreed, he took ownership of my fork, and quickly polished off the remnants of my meal.  I rushed out the door, didn't look back, and hopped over to Casino Royale to double fist $1 frozen margaritas for the monorail ride back to my hotel.  Oops, so much for what happens in Vegas. . ."}
{"text":"Worst location ever. Had to repeat the order 9 times in the drive thru. Every time he read it back it was completely different. Asked for a side of teriyaki sauce- get to the window and they forgot it completely. Got home and the teriyaki sauce was awful and tasted fishy. Called to let them know- and the associate only says there's nothing she can do unless we want to come back for more sauce lol as if that changes the flavor- when we try to explain she needs to check the batch- she hangs up on us.terrible service"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've been  to this restaurant and all of the times the food was awesome and the staff was Reay friendly. I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for years, but the last year or so this place has taken a nosedive. First I noticed the take out containers shrunk. Then the scoops shrunk, but the prices grew. They tend to short scoop so you feel like you're getting ripped off. Very inconsistent too. I would be behind someone getting an orange chicken bowl get two scoops, but I would only get one scoop in my kung pao bowl. We always have to wait for food to get made, meanwhile our boxes are sitting there getting cold. I live 7 minutes away and I always have to reheat my food. Last week I swear there wasn't any sauce on the kung pao chicken! I didn't smell it or taste it at all. I have reached my limit and I won't be going back anytime soon as the inconsistency is maddening."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the food was garbage. I got chow mien which was burnt and dried out, and the orange chicken which was also very dry."}
{"text":"So out of all the Asian cuisine around Parma I'd say this food taste the best. You really can't go wrong with a panda bowl of orange chicken and white rice. I've eaten her a lot recently and the only gripe I have is the chow mein although tastes great has had big clumps of cabbage 1 out of 5 times ordered. Because the resteraunt is fairly new there's gonna be growing pains with staff and cooks but in comparison to the Asian food around it's a step above."}
{"text":"Consistantly prepared the same from one local restaurant to the next.  I love the Walnut glazed prawns.  But other dishes are also good.  It's decent food with an Asian appeal. I stir clear of the dishes with a lot of dye in the sauce but that's usually only 2. It's freshly prepared about every 25 minutes in most cases and it's openuntil 10:30pm"}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express location I've ever been to. Walked in at lunch time and they did not have any chow mein, orange chicken and two other dishes. There weren't any other people in line yet I still have to wait 15 minutes for my order. There was a bucket and mop in front of the ordering station and I asked them to move it so that there wouldn't be any accidents and the girl just looked blankly at me as if I was speaking a different language. The guy making the food was standing around talking to the two girls as if they were all there for fun. After waiting for 15 minutes, I asked for my money back and left."}
{"text":"I will give 5 stars when customer service is worth rembering. I walked in for lunch. Ryan greeted me. Asked how i was doing today, asked if i wanted a sample. Then upsized my drink.He spoke with strong and clear voice. Super nice guy. Hi'sdameaner was amazing. Polite. Thanked me for comming in"}
{"text":"Since panda express is a chain its all around so everything is the same. The service was pretty good. They were very friendly and the restaurant was clean"}
{"text":"Good and cheap food in Vegas. Only complain- they don't give u water, u have to buy bottled water. While chipotle right next to it has no problem in giving a glass for water."}
{"text":"I purchased my meal, and when I get home I find out they didn't even bother putting in hot sauce or soy sauce as silly it my seems it completely destroyed my meal. Now a days all restaurants always do this. Is not the customer job to remind them of the things that need to be in the bag. Fast food places keep the same prices all year round...always the same bad quality services as well.  Thank you Panda Express."}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly. Ther service is quick, without being too impersonal. I stop in from time to time on my lunch break and always find that the food is fresh and the service is done right. I am able to get good fresh food within minutes and enjoy my lunch hour.   The only thing I would keep an eye on is the volume of the music within the dining area. There have been a couple of times where it was pretty loud, enough to where I wouldn't answer my phone while inside, and I also couldn't hear the music from my iPod with my headphones firmly inserted.   The foodis pretty standard for a Panda Express, and I find this location does a better job at keeping the food fresh between rushes. There have been a couple of times I thought I could have used a little more meat portion in my order, but it's about average for anywhere you go."}
{"text":"I have been to this location on 59th & Olive Avenues, many, many times.  Today was my last visit as the 4 women working ignored us, the 5 groups of people behind us got served before we did, customers even asked these women to serve us first as we were first in line they all responded that they didn't see us!  How ignorant can you be!  I am appalled as to the ignorance of employees & manager who never stepped in to see what the ordeal was!  I will post over every social media sight as to the rude & ignorance of these employees!"}
{"text":"I usually like Panda Express. The veggies, rice, noodles are always good. However, the chicken, more often than not, is tough. The coatings are stale-tasting and smothers the tiny bites of chicken. Otherwise, it's decent fast food."}
{"text":"I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time going to this place for dinner. I got there at 7:00pm and the line was a little long but I figured it'd go fast and the food would be worth it. By the time I got up to the menu to order, they had ran out of steamed rice, which is the only side I like. Since I had already waited in line, I decided to just get two entrees. My total came out to $8 but when I made it up to the window, at 7:30, she tried charging me $17 and handing me a giant bag of food. I told her that wasn't right I only order 1 plate and she didn't even know what I was talking about. I had to order my food for a second time and then sit there and watch her make it. That, and the fact that I spent 40 minutes at this FAST food place was ridiculous. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you don't feel like paying 30 bucks for a meal and you just need to refuel or recover from that Vegas hangover, this is the spot to hit up!   The portions are definitely larger than most other Panda Expresses and the food is consistently quasi-Chinese.  It's like McDonald's, you'll always get about the same thing taste wise."}
{"text":"Best Panda I've ever had by far. So fresh and delicious! Great service as well! The chowmein was super fresh and not full of veggies, the orange chicken was great with not too many super large pieces. Very good, will definitely be coming to this one more! It's also extremely clean."}
{"text":"Food at this location is consistent with the look and taste of all other Panda chains. The Issue is the rude people working behind the counter. No customer service skills whatsoever. They're there to collect a \"paycheck\" and to be a body. So if service matters, skip this Panda Express."}
{"text":"Went in drive through about 3 PM on 11/28/2015.  Spent about $18 on one 3-item meal and one 2-item meal.  Very simple and uncomplicated order and customer.  The drive home was only about 3 minutes.  Family was VERY disappointed with all of our food, I was shocked at how much incredibly worse it was than most of my Panda E. experiences.  The rice was hard and uncooked in all of our containers.  My 'mushroom & chicken' was a soggy, nasty looking mess of almost exclusively mushrooms, more gray, soggy and falling apart (same with the chicken - looking especially anonymous and nasty).  I get that dish a lot at other locations so I know what to expect.  Also paid extra for the shrimp/walnut and the shrimp was limp and weird looking.  As usual, not the time nor energy to drive back and make it right.  That's the whole point about drive thru.....Unlike a motel or a full svc restaurant, the customer shouldn't have the onus to come BACK and give you a chance to make it right - there is no back, they have moved on with their afternoon - you get it right the first time.   Apparently, when you go inside a Panda, under the customer's watchful eyes they make better judgment calls about the portion selection process (old vs. new, etc).  But during drive thru they take advantage of your ignorance and serve you the nasty stuff that the dog wouldn't even eat.  Or it may actually BE the dog.  Either way, my portion of \"dog\" was bad, sir!"}
{"text":"For my first review on yelp, it's actually a 4.5, but I'm giving a 5. I've always gotten very service and the food portions are pretty good.  If you've been to several Pandas, you've noticed that some give so little. Customer service is very good for what it is. Fast food is sometimes crazy. I would agree that sometimes the food servers get distracted with another workers job, but that's life. Tell me that doesn't happen at carls, mcdonalds,,..etc"}
{"text":"Terrible service, so-so food.  This place is super confusing and almost misleading.   You order from the board, but you don't realize that you get charged extra for some entrees even though there is no indication of that until you actually start to order it. It felt like a trap. Like, who wants to sit at a drive-thru and make ANOTHER choice because you don't want to pay an extra dollar for what you already chose?  Anyway. I wanted to get extra vegetables to go with my honey shrimp entree (which was good, but for that extra dollar it's way smaller than the other entrees) and some chicken teriyaki for my dogs. They told me the teriyaki would be an extra five minutes so pull up and wait. I did so and waited 10 MINUTES for my food. I finally had to drive back through to get it. NOT HAPPY.   I also asked the people at the window if they could make sure my other entrees were hot despite the wait for the chicken. They assured me it would be. It wasn't.  I would really avoid this place. It's super expensive for what you get and the service is terrible. The vegetables were good, but the spring rolls and the shrimp weren't good enough to pay for."}
{"text":"Food poisoning. Ordered lunch at 12:00 and within two hours of eating, (~1:30) I had awful stomach pains, diarrhea, and vomited what I ate. At one point I was in so much pain I was contemplating going to hospital. OMG I felt like I was dying! Was walking in circles trying to feel better. I called to report it to the restaurant, and the manager told me it was not food poisoning, and I would have to wait until tomorrow to call if I felt badly. He proceeds to tell me no one else has called and food poisoning doesn't happen that quick and it could be something else I ate. (FYI this was the only thing I have eaten today.) Never once did he ask me what I ordered or ate, offer me any sympathy of my current condition, or ask how they could make it right. No facts were gathered. He was too busy making excuses and denying it. F#@! Panda Express. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"just across my school so its very convenient, quiet the  place and the foods are always delicious.the fried rice,the chow mein,shanghai angus steak and orange chicken our fave!and drinks are also taste good."}
{"text":"Chow Mein,Honey Walnut Shrimp&Black Pepper Chicken is my husbands fave. And for me Fried Rice & Shanghai Angus Steak is my fave. thats why we come to Panda Express. comfy food."}
{"text":"the variety of menu to choose from and always delicious.like our favorites; white fried rice, chow mein,general tso chicken,shanghai angus steak and orange chicken. Highly Recommended the location and friendliness of the staff. I willdefinitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Been there a few times because I love Panda.  The People are nice, but they do not have enough help.  Was there last week and one girl helped 7 customers with their food and ringing them up.  after a while, a cook showed up to cook, but she had to do double duty during the lunch rush.  Also, there is never enough sauce on the entrees.  It's like dry breading on the orange chicken, sesame chicken etc.  I'll try it one more time, but after that  - no more!"}
{"text":"30 minutes in the drive thru, what a joke. Although it seems to be the same at every panda express. Where's corporate to kick these locations in the gear?  Update: I wrote this while still in the drive thru line and initially gave them 2 stars. Somehow, from the time that I ordered until I got to the window, they ran out of the white rice that I ordered."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong again! Everything is dry! This just sucks! My dogs food  is better!"}
{"text":"Food was sub-par, they were stingy with the food, the chopsticks were splinters basically. Okay if you want meh food but I don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Tengo tres meses visitando este lugar una ves por semana y eh notado la diferencia empezaron a usar un plato más grande y voluptuoso pero con la misma cantidad de comida o menos. Siempre que llego todos saludan amablemente pero esta ultima ocasión pienso que Mariana estaba enojada pensé que me iba atender y se dio la vuelta sin saludar. También la máquina de sodas la deben arreglar siempre que me sirvo brisk se queda tirando hasta que aplastas otro tipo de soda. Creo que es mi última visita a esta ubicación"}
{"text":"The food and service at this Panda Express tends to vary.  Sometimes all of the food is hot and delicious and other times it is cold and tastes as if it has been sitting out for awhile.  I have gotten to the point of looking in the trays to see what looks fresh and what doesn't.  I have gone in when they have cooked each item I ordered fresh.  That was the best!!  I'd rather wait to have  hot, fresh food than mediocre food that has been sitting out too long."}
{"text":"For a quick and tasty Chinese meal, Panda Express is my number one choice.  You can't beat good food, fast and at a great price.  It's our go to place when we want a quick bite.  This location is very convenient for us."}
{"text":"Food was fast fresh and delicious. But I'll never go back. Biggest waste of $8. A bowl full of rice with very few pieces of meat."}
{"text":"I think they have new management! Thank God! The ladies at the counter were very very friendly and genuine. They seemed to have turned the place around. If they keep this up, I will definitely return! Bravo Panda"}
{"text":"Watched fox 5 this morning and Panda Express was cooking their new five flavor shrimp, made me hungry for it, went to this location at 11am, store opens at 10 am, half the dishes were empty, shiny clean as food had not been prepared as of yet, one hour after opening, I told them I wanted the five flavor shrimp and she told me I would have to wait for it to be made. She told the cook I was waiting for the shrimp and the expression he gave to her, I left the restaurant, you would think a dish they are promoting today they would have it ready, well I went to the next Panda, corner of Decatur and Charleston, the line was to the door, I took a peek at the shrimp pan and it had two tiny dried up shrimp in it, so much for Panda, never got my shrimp, pissed me off for the whole day. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Please share your kind words on Yelp! (Just copy and paste your comments.)   My daughter and I were in Chandler so decided to go shopping at the mall. Panda Express is her favorite place to eat. There was no one in line so our order was quick, easy & they just put out new orange chicken."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal for a great price. However, the service provided by the employees was poor, inadequate, sub-par, unsatisfactory, bad.... you get the idea. I would suggest driving the extra miles to another location to save yourself from a dreadful experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Been there over 8 times the last 2 months. Cold, Burnt, Rock hard orange chicken. Rice all clumped together and tasted frozen. So not a fan of this Panda. There are other ones farther away that I would rather drive too and get better food. I love Panda - just not this location."}
{"text":"I have been to this location before, and went in today to get a couple of items, the store has a really good atmosphere as usual, the food was great. I wanted some black pepper chicken that wasn't quite ready yet so I had to wait a few minutes. James behind the counter was very friendly and offered me a drink, he was very nice and apologized for me having to wait, it was OK because I was not in a rush. Overall very satisfied with this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came and bought two dinner plates that were each 2 entrees the portions were very small and it took forever it was also cold. I'm very disappointed. I won't be back my receipt number is 408621 ."}
{"text":"1) Food - The food is delicious and looks good too. It was better than some of the food I've paid double for at sit-down restaurants. Five thumbs up.  2) Service - I made a point to mention to the cashier that the food was delicious and whoever made it could cook. (When I dropped by all of the staff were clearly either teenagers or very early 20's.) The cashier laughed and told the rest of the staff who all had a chuckle over this. Overall, the staff was nonchalant and indifferent. Not necessarily rude but perhaps uncaring. I do hope they don't film each other bathing in the sinks after closing.   Overall, I can tolerate some wiseacres to have good food at a cheap price. It doesn't happen often, especially in airports."}
{"text":"Don't even bother going there 2-3 before they close nothing is made and they act like you are an inconvenience if you ask if they can make some. The one on signalbute stays stocked up don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"Cashier and Manager pocketed my change and pretended that the cameras we're broken. Poor customer service by Alex the manager who stated he would call me back in 5 minutes and never did. I ended up getting a refund from the corporate office and filed a report with Glendale PD. Alex or Alejandro is a scammer! Watch out for him and his employees."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointing.   My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now and we finally did. We both ordered a plate each. I also got an egg roll and my husband had a spring roll - we shared a medium drink.   It came out to $29 dollars - so not super cheap Chinese food but unfortunately it tasted like cheap stale Chinese food.   The rice was very dry and flavourless. Tasted like old Chinese buffet rice.  The chicken was chewy and again tasted kind of old. It could of been good if it was fresher possibly?  My egg roll was alright but unlike any egg roll I have had before because it had a strange flavour while my husband threw out his spring rolls they were that bad.   The amount of food you got was ridiculous for the price too. One little scoop of food... Would of honestly been better going to the mall for Chinese. Better portions, better food and cheaper.   We didn't go at an odd time either it was around 7:20pm. So there really wasn't any reason for the food to taste like it was 6 hours old.   Staff wasn't friendly and didn't seem to want to be there.   We definitely won't be back. This is one of review that surprised me. I had heard such amazing things about this company from my friends in the states. I guess they couldn't bring that same amount of skill here in Canada."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice during swing shift and the girl, Bree, who's served me both times is about as rude as they come. She acts like I'm putting her out trying to order food. Never once smiles, I almost feel guilty asking her to do her job.   Other than that the good is good and the place is clean.  Bree is enough to keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Second time here Theres 7 people working 15 mins to get food its 455pm. The apps are burnt to a crisp and she had the nerve to start giving me the brown dried out crab! My bill was 21.00 and heres a pix of the two meals.... Ones VERY light the other normal.  Will NEVER come here again, the down side is we havent been to a good Panda Express in a long long time and we eat there a lit. Might need to go back to China A Go Go"}
{"text":"Today i have to write a review... Its 1230 so they SHOULD BE lunch ready... The white rice, completely underdone to the point of being crunchy...wtf??? The orange chicken while it tasted good was very overcooked. My almond shrimp was ok but i expected more than 4 which is a constant problem with this location I normally get pot stickers and crab or the fried shrimp instead but today all of them were very old and burnt from being under the lamps. Its very sad that i havent been able to say great food at any point at this location.   Im hoping someone there will read a review and fix ANY of the issues they have with the food. For 22.00 i just expect more from Panda. UPDATE****i wondered why we order the same things three times a week. Its usually 17. Give or take Its gone to 22-24  They have been charging 3.90 for the 3rd item On each plate.  I asked my son to watch and he forgets so today i got receipt I chicken bowl and a 3 item dinner no shrimp today 20.30 So i look and see 3.90 for small entree charge Thats his 3rd item When did this begin????oh i know, about two months ago The food here is no longer worth 22.00 ****9/17 update**** I gave 4 stars went last night and food was great again!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place :) I've been to the Cheyenne/15, Lake Mead and Buffalo and Rainbow/Oakey locations and they're all good. I guess the big thing is getting something while it's hot and fresh out of the wok, but it's pretty much all good. My favorite is the string bean chicken which I strongly recommend. Might as well get the 3 item combo if there's anyone else to share it with."}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly and I was greeted immediately. A taste of the new dish was offered. Food was hot and delicious"}
{"text":"Panda Express hit the spot. I was undecided about what to fix for dinner. I made an appetizer while I pondered on what else to fix. Husband and Panda Express to the rescue. For under $30, hubby brought home 3 bowls and 1 plate.   Plate was filled with orange chicken, lo mein and fried rice. The orange chicken was tangy. The lo mein and fried rice was passable. I enjoyed the teriyaki fried rice. The chicken was nicely caramelized. Finally, the Beijing beef had great texture and was well seasoned. If I had to order a meal for myself. it would be the Beijing beef, tender and flavorful. Thank you Panda Express and loving husband."}
{"text":"Affordable and fixes a child's craving for American Chinese food. Daughter number #2 absolutely had to have Panda Express as we drove home last night. We sampled the Shanghai Angus Beef and decided it still had that frozen beef aftertaste. Plus, it was $1.50 more than other entrees.   Tip: They advertise a choice of chow mein or fried rice for your side, but they will give you half and half if you ask.  Daughter really wanted the Beijing Beef, deep fried thinly sliced beef in a spicy sauce, really was more Szechuan inspired than anything I ate in Beijing. But with a slip of tongue, she got the Broccoli Beef. She also got the Cashew Shrimp. I tasted the Chicken Breast with String Beans and liked that alright. I felt bad that she did not order the Beijing Beef so added that to our 3 entree deal which was $4 plus more to our bill. However, watching my child enjoy her meal made it worth it.  I have frequently endured Panda Express in the past when my husband carried out after work. I admit that eating the food onsite was much better. Fresher from the wok to the table. One of the cooks at the back handled the large wok very well. I admit I was impressed. This trip made me like American Chinese food a little better."}
{"text":"Second time in less than a month that we've waited more than 20 minutes in the drive through and the fried rice isn't even cooked all the way. The food and staff here are awful"}
{"text":"Ok ... 2 days in 1 week ... drive thru took 18 minutes to get to the window, then another 7 to get the food AFTER I got my drink and paid.  Both days, same experience ....  So today, third day, I figured I would go inside and try that line, it should be faster ...  Nope!!  What is going on inside is not only slow and mouthy servers, but most people just try \"samples\" until they're full, then order a bowl to get out cheap, and leave a huge line behind them.  I was 3rd in line.  24 minutes later, I went to a different restaurant ... after watching 2 ladies in front of me with kids, getting samples of freaking everything, giving it to their vultures of kids, ordering 2 tiny meals, and leaving ... 12 minutes of samples per group ... it was ridiculous!!!  Does this restaurant even care that they're getting ripped off?  Oh well, I don't even care ...   I WILL NEVER PAY MONEY TO THE AVON STORE AGAIN .... and neither will anyone that I know!!  Unbelievable that a franchise owner let's this happen ... let's the rude management hire incompetent line workers to keep business flowing ...  My orange chicken was overcooked ... way overcooked!!  It was more fried breading than chicken ...   The lo mein was as dry as the napkins ... and it was very bland!    General tso was the same as orange chicken above, but spicy ... really, really spicy!  And forget about the steamed veggies ... they're warm, I'll give them that ... but cooked??  Heck no ... they were as hard as fresh out of the produce department ... the broccoli wasn't soft ... at all!!!  It's not hard to steam veggies ... but it does take time ... and they apparently don't have the time to cook the food properly ... or they forget about it when it's cooking and it gets overcooked, hard as a board, and dry ...  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!   And Panda, don't bother responding to this ... this isn't for you ... this is to warn others to SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE .... THIS PLACE STINKS!!!"}
{"text":"I could literally eat here every single day. I wish thos location had the boba tea... if they did I would definitely stop by every single day. I love how you can see them cooking and see the fresh veggies all cut up in the fridges. The manager at this location is hands on and very friendly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! They only serve you a little bit when I asked to get the plus meal of shrimp she only gave me half a spoon what a disappointment never going there again."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about the food, because, you know, it's Panda Express - it's the same everywhere you go.  I do want to take a second to single out Lin, a cashier at this location. She was incredibly nice and really looks out for her customers, especially if they work in the mall (wall workers need I protect our own more!).  It was my first day working in the Miracle Mile Shops and she noticed my badge when I was checking out and immediately let me know about the employee discount and to make sure I mention I work here each time I come in. I come from the Fashion Show Mall where the service at their Panda Express is a little lacking and they don't even offer an employee discount. I know, as a business, you don't want to give out too many discounts, but Lin was nice enough to point it out in addition to having a great personality and having a very friendly face."}
{"text":"Good selection of Chinese dishes. The Beijing Beef is so good, I got an extra order to go. Clean restaurant; a good location. Not so many losers on this side of town. Forget about the combo plates - pick what you want, make your own meal. It only costs about $12. Have fun."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near Highway-95, this Panda Express doesn't stray far away from the others.  The best part about this particular PE is that it has a drive-thru open until 10pm.  Try to sneak in a minute past that, and they won't answer; not even to tell you they're closed. *shoulder shrugs* I drive past this specific one on my way home from Church on Thursday nights and I almost always get a craving for it.  Big meal choice: Noodles, Mandarin Chicken, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Crispy Beef PLUS Cheese Rangoons ;x  Small meal choice: Panda bowl with Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Not the best Chinese food in town, but then again, Chinese food has always felt and tasted so greasy to me. When I'm up for a cheat night for some Chinese, PE is my go-to. I'll come back when I feel like throwin down the calories on a late night tip!"}
{"text":"I love all Panda Express locations (because of the food) but this one gets an A+ because the employees are so friendly and flexible. If you want something made fresh just tell them. They're happy to do it.   I love the Sweetfire Chicken Breast so if I notice it's low and they have to make some I ask for no onions and they're cool with that.   I still wish they would carry Firecracker Chicken all year round, not just 6-8 weeks a year, it's soooooo good! And I am SO happy they put the egg back in their fried rice! It was corn for some time and totally inedible but it's back to being fantastic.   Several times that I've asked for something made fresh and I am waiting they offer me a free drink, which is very nice of them. I carry water on me all the time, so I'm good for the offer sure is nice.   And of course the best part; Yummy Fortune Cookie!"}
{"text":"I don't know who the tiny Hispanic manager is but I am not thrilled with the way he treats his employees and customers alike. Always in a pissy mood, extremely condescending, and makes servers put back portions if they happen to go in excess. I usually enjoy the food and service but lately it's been mostly miss. I always order online ahead of time and go to the pick up counter. They always ask, \"um, what do you want?\" Like? Rude much? It is what it is, I guess."}
{"text":"I try not to eat at Panda express.. I don't even eat panda back at home but I was on vacation and I was hungry so I opted for it. It was like any other time at Panda and it was good. Very convenient, located in the food court with the pizza place, chipolte and micky d's right up stairs."}
{"text":"the acctitud of some emplyees is some rude, never give a smile, especilaty with hispanic people i visited this place often"}
{"text":"Food was fresh, great manager helped us and very efficient. Kudos from one restaurant manager to another!"}
{"text":"This is one of my kid's favorite place. He love orange chicken, sweet chill chicken. I like to take  rice and noodles"}
{"text":"Came here on vacation 2 weeks ago. Food is good (same as anywhere else), but this place lost major points for incorrect change and wrong charge!  1st my sister ordered a kids meal, the cashier charged it as a teryi bowl!  Yes, it makes a difference because she saves $0.75  and every penny counts, esp at the penny slots!  Then she gave me my change and it was wrong!  $0.25 cents off!!  Maybe she was having a bad day, I dont know, but when it comes to money and charges, she needs to concentrate and pay attention or else you'd get unhappy customers!"}
{"text":"Cashier at drive through was very rude and snatched my money from me and then when he handed back the receipt he threw it at me. Barely said two words besides the total, my plate top was halfway off & he didn't provide the sweet and sour sauce for the egg roll. Usually I receive better service from this location."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and clean restaurant. The wait time can be a little long sometimes. The food is hit or miss. It's either fresh and great or old and dry. Just depends on your timing. Prices have steadily been rising, but I guess that's to be expected in today's day and age."}
{"text":"I stop by this location at least once a week. Everyone at this location is always extremely friendly and courteous. The items are always available and fresh. I ordered the mushroom chicken, teriyaki chicken, and pepper chicken they were all delicious. I only wish that bbq pork was available in Nevada. I ordered the BBQ pork regularly when I lived in Southern California, but it's not on the menu in Nevada. Also, cashier Lesley was very friendly!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night and so disappointed. Stomach aches now throughout my house. I will never eat here again. If you want Chinese food do not go to this place. I was so looking forward to it. The food was okay, nothing to write home about or pay for in comparison to other Chinese places. But the after effect is HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Alrighty....customer service has improved and food selection and quality is much better. Still seems like here is not enough stuff. Poor kids are scrambling to keep up. I increased the starts to three.   I have been to this Panda Express five times and four of five times service has sucked and have had to wait for food to be made. One time the orange chicken wasn't even made correctly. I had to drive back after getting home from a long day at work to get a new order. Come to find out they blatantly told me the last shift didn't change the oil. I'm not sure how that had an impact. It seems they are always low staffed as well. Jael is worthless and makes the managers look bad. Please improve. There is a reason why this location is never busy and has such a low rating. I don't That's all...rant over."}
{"text":"I've had hit or miss with this location, and Panda Express in general. Sometimes the food is soggy, burnt, or just old. They are also stingy when it comes to portions. You'll get a lot of rice but not a comparable amount of entree.   However, more often than not I have a good experience. I usually order fried rice, orange chicken, and sweet fire chicken breast with a water cup!   The restaurant itself is very nice and modern. I often have seen corporate representatives at this location so it must either need help or is just a special location. It's usually clean with nice seating, however when it's busy the seating can be limited."}
{"text":"Went to Panda Express thinking my food allergies wouldn't be an issue. I was wrong. I let the person behind the counter know of my allergies and if it was okay for me to have the chicken entree. She said I'd be fine. That night I ended up getting sick. When I went online to check the ingredients they used, it confirmed my suspicions. Some ingredients that I'm allergic to were in fact in my meal. It doesn't help to ask the person behind the counter because they'll tell you it's fine, even if they don't know and then you end up sick anyway"}
{"text":"Its starting to become a habit that if you come through the drive thru, youll be sitting in the parking lot for 10 times the waiting time she told you, watching everyone else come and go.  So after about 15 to 20 minutes I go inside to see what is taking so long. Apparently im waiting on beijing beef. She has other orders she is trying to get out to other people sitting around the parking lot and waiting. She gets off two other orders, comes back, and starts working on a NEW order. Meanwhile, my food is packed up, minus 1 box, sitting on the counter getting cold. I interupt her and ask what is it that I am waiting on, which I find out is the beef. There is beef sitting in the warming area, completly full. Why would she start packaging a new order when I have been sitting out here waiting? First off she needs to let people know upfront before swiping a card that there will be a wait time and for what product and give a more realistic wait time."}
{"text":"Worst location I've been to. Tried them twice... first time the line was so long it went out the door and it was raining...  Second time was a waste of my money... and I've been to 3 different locations recently. All have been super busy but this location is super slow and they really impolite. If you ever want to see zombies serving food, this is the place.   It seemed they were also low on man power both visits... One cook was back there and they were behind on replenishing most of the options. The food that was served to me was burnt (teriyaki chicken) and had to have been sitting there a long while.  The other location: 1752 S Signal Butte Rd Mesa AZ 85208  They had a long line but went by fast, food was great, they were nice and had a good moral going. WISH YOU GUYS COULD TAKE TIP MONEY!!"}
{"text":"Most of the servers here are always happy and friendly. sometimes they even ask you to try one of their items if you're not sure before you buy. Sometimes it gets really busy here but the workers are really fast. My favorite dish here is the Sweet-fire Chicken."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Very clean and very satisfying. The consistency of the food is always the same which is good!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Panda, so I ran over to pick up some food for dinner. I ordered honey walnut shrimp and shanghai steak along with fried rice. Both items are considered specialty, so there is $1.25 up charge for each item which I am ok with. I am not ok with paying extra and receiving crap. I got there an hour and a half before close, and everything looked ok. The lady said that the food was made recently. Well she lied. The shrimp was luke warm and the breading was mushy. It was literally falling off without me even touching it. The fried rice tasted old. The shanghai steak was ok but the temperature was off for sure. I think it is totally unacceptable to be serving food that is mushy and not fresh. Isn't there some kind of time frame when these items have to be tossed? Do these employees need more training on food safety procedures? Surely the food I was served tonight was not at the proper temperature and not cooked recently. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow I couldn't  believe this place had such bad food. Here is the quick breakdown: -Orange chicken was chewy - Honey walnut shrimp was chewy (I ordered it because it had just come in fresh) - chow mein was made fresh but tasted burnt (happens when the wok isn't cleaned from the last order) I usually take all food home but this went straight into the garbage."}
{"text":"So they were out of brown rice today. There are signs all over the store that say \"we now have brown rice\" and when I go to order it there is none. The cook was laughing when he said it would be 30 minutes until it was ready. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"I love the order online feature.  They fulfill  specific instructions in the comments section such as tender vegetables and fresh Orange Chicken, Beijing Beef or Chow Mein.  BUT I have noticed they are getting skimpy on the main entree.  They need to stop that as you aren't going to be satisfied on just rice and chow mein."}
{"text":"Kendra greeted me at the drive up window with the friendliest smile and best attitude I have ever experienced in a fast food chain. She was a pleasure and I hope Panda Express recognizes great customer service in their employees. Because if Kendra I will return to this location and refer friends....thank you Kendra"}
{"text":"Poor poor service. At the peak of lunch time they run our of Chow Mein but had too much rice cooked, a large bowl sat and Im sure will be cold by the time the serve it! I already had a long wait to get my food, I was not goingt to wait another 5 min while they cooked the Chow Mein that should have already been done when they realized it was getting low. I will go to the Baseline location from now on, never this one again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service today. I try to post only positive reviews, but this was a particularly frustrating visit from start to finish. The woman who waited on us said the egg rolls would be \"three minutes\". She proceeded to walk away and prepare everything but the egg rolls. We stood waiting for at least 15 minutes (I am not exaggerating) until I finally asked a guy that was working if the eggs rolls were done. He said \"they`ve been ready for awhile\".  Staff seems to need some extra training on duties and customer service. It could have been an off day. I will try them again."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  My only complaint was the amount of food that is given via the drive-thru versus going inside.  I order the 2 piece entree with one side.  This included orange chicken and the sesame chicken.  Both were fresh but the quantity was small.  In addition, the noodles and rice did not taste fresh at all."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait about half hour either in the drive thru or inside. Then get not full plates of food and old. This has got to be the worst Panda Express I've been to."}
{"text":"When they're rushed, they show it. My 2 entree plate wasn't as plentiful as I recall, it's as though they skimped out on portions for the sake of feeding the entire line before they had to refill each entree. I paid extra for my Honey Walnut Shrimp to have the correct portion but unfortunately, this location disregards portion control when the crowd gets large."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday, busy for lunch. I ordered a Panda Bowl with brown rice, half steamed veggies and half Shanghai beef. I haven't had Panda in years, the flavors were just as I remembered! I was disappointed the brown rice wasn't quite ready for consumption, real hard and grainy. The Shanghai beef was absolutely delicious, same with veggies. Unfortunately Panda hits me with awful gas and stomach aches, exhaustion. I don't trust where their food comes from, my love for Panda must be depleting."}
{"text":"Like every new business there will be growing pains. One of the problems with this place is they're trying to balance having fresh out of the pan food ready a la carte. They cook small portions so it's not sitting out long. Trying to do this and trying to serve a lunch rush doesn't always work. As a matter of fact if l walk in and don't see the girl with the Raquel name tag, I usually roll my eyes and mutter,\"$ hit\". She seems to be one her game and handles the kitchen staff well. The food is not bad. But some of the sauces can be a little on the sweet side. The portions are generous. I usually have the Beijing Beef or the Sweetfire chicken.  Clean,  open concept,  friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Panda Express and I can say that I am a HUGE fan!! It is so hard to find great oriental food that I actually like but this place has surpassed my expectations!! I especially love the shanghai meat and will be back for more soon."}
{"text":"Worst Panda ever.  Went in on a  Saturday afternoon and everything and I mean everything was empty.  I along with a few other customers had to wait for noodles.  There was a manager named Joannie and she was yelling and her employees for no reason.  She was rude and had an attitude with us waiting because we all wanted noodles instead of rice.  I felt really bad for the young kids working there.  They all felt bad and NO ONE should have to work with a boss like that, especially when you are starting out in the workforce.  Get it together Panda.  I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The employees do not speak English and are idiots. I tried to order through the drive through and the lady didn't even know what I was saying. We went inside and did not get any kind of greeting or acknowledgement. I tried to tell the manager the lady sucks at her job and she ignored me and started talking to her co workers. I will spread the word that this place sucks."}
{"text":"Cheat eats on the Vegas strip! I remember the days I used to come to Vegas with my family and food was hella cheap. Not anymore.   If you're staying at City Center and looking for a quick bite for a decent price, Panda at the Planet Hollywood across the street is $8 for a two item combo. A premium compared to other locations but I'll take it.   Took it back to the suites where there was a kitchen and dining room and feasted away."}
{"text":"Ordered a one entree meal. Fried rice and lo mein, with orange chicken. I've been craving orange chicken since being pregnant.  Was disappointed to come home and find that the orange chicken was way to spicy! I could see pepper seeds all over it. It was like orange Kung pao chicken. It was pretty disappointing since I'd been craving it and knew if I kept eating it spicy it'd give me a stomach ache. Also we got mostly cabbage and hardly any noodles in our lo mein.  This was not the Panda Express I'm used to and love."}
{"text":"This place looks like it had a change over... its over priced food was cold and when the lady put my sons food in the bag it was not closed and by the time we walked outside it was all leaked out in the bag.. poor service wont be back .. dont even want to give one star after seeing other reviews..yuck"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight after a 14 hour shift at work as I sometimes do when I just want a quick, easy meal.  Have been to several locations over the years, and previously was treated well at this one.   Tonight, however, the person putting together the to-go boxes of food seemed to purposely skimp on my food...    the person right in front of me ordered almost the exact same thing I did, except with noodles instead of rice.  They got heaping portions of noodles, and heaping portions of their 2 meat dishes.    When my turn came, I was very polite and ordered my food.   I got a small serving of rice, and the smallest portions of meat dishes that I've ever had at a Panda Express.  The person immediately behind me then ordered and I watched as she also got heaping portions of everything she ordered.   When I casually and politely mentioned something to the server, I got a dirty look, and a \"we give everyone the same\", and he walked away.    Panda Express isn't gourmet food, I understand that.  It's reasonably cheap, pretty consistent and it's everywhere in Las Vegas.  Next time I'll be sure to visit a different location, or better yet, head over to Spring Mountain for something more authentic, and better service."}
{"text":"Honestly this is such a good panda, but y'all need more employees ok. The night shift is always struggling which is just too much for me. Y'all didn't have soy sauce tonight I'm like ??? Ok. Then she was in a rush & had a lil attitude, understood bc she look stressed but boo calm down. Other than that y'all are amazing ok! Employees are so kind, remember my order & always add my military discount !"}
{"text":"Horrible food ! It's was disgusting. My noodles were burnt my chicken was over cooked and greasy. I also go a fortune cookie with no fortune inside."}
{"text":"Avoid this location!!! Terrible service and always out of food!! There are several other locations very close by (power-baseline & signal butte and baseline). I don't know why I keep trying this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I are both violently ill after eating there last night.  Between the two of us, we had mushroom chicken, teriyaki chicken and orange chicken.  Boy are we paying for it today!! I did call to tell them this morning and a manager is supposed to call us later. I would be surprised if we were the only ones affected. We went through the drive through around 9:30pm last night (husband works nights) and by 8am, he was heaving at work and I was heaving at home. We won't be back for a long time..."}
{"text":"Slowest service.  Drive thru took 25 mins...  Just got home and updating my review. The drive thru was a horrible experience. Multiply cars just left in front me after placing their order and before paying. So they had no idea who placed which order once I arrived at the pick up window and no one even cared either.   This place has a great location and they seem to be busy at most times during the day, but if they do not approve their customer service and wait time they will not last too long.    Great location for a Chick-fil-A is this place goes under...  Food is okay.  General Tso and the Kung poa are the better options I have experienced so far."}
{"text":"The employees are great & outgoing. The food is fast, hot and delicious, highly recommend this Panda Express."}
{"text":"The staff is nice, for the most part. The food quality consistency is by far the worst. I have been going here since they opened and hoping that they will get better, meaning they would be the same quality as other panda express restaurants. The honey walnut shrimp was disgusting it must've been sitting out for very long time because the skin falls right off with the touch of the fork. I only ate one shrimp and threw the rest away. I waited more than 20 minutes for my teriyaki chicken to be cooked, when I got home which is less than a mile away, 0.7 miles to be excite. The teriyaki chicken was hot but choemwein and the honey walnut shrimp were both cold when I receive them. This is not a one time event, this happens all the time. It sucks because I really like panda express but not this location. I have complained to the managers in person plenty of time is but nothing ever seems to change. Might as well shut this place down because they're serving nothing but trash. I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Today I visit this location hoping to get what I paid for, but that wasn't the case.  To start off the cashier was the person who was serving, he touched money before helping me the proceeded to help me without washing his hands.  I ordered a bowl, I didn't know I was ordering a bowl of rice! I had maybe about 3 pieces to of meat and 4 pieces of broccoli, if I just wanted rice I would of ordered that but I didn't, I ordered a bowl with beef and broccoli.   Truly disappointed in cleanliness and portions.   Then I'm asked after my transaction to give them a 5? I will not give you a 5 yelp."}
{"text":"Nothing like biting into a mouthful of fried rice with a long black hair in it! I'm a blonde! Will never be going there again, stomach so upset I feel like I'm going to vomit!!! Ordered it take out otherwise I would have flipped it over on my table!"}
{"text":"Hey! This is going to be a very disappointing review. The first thing being that I haven't eaten from here in years and suddenly had a urge to try Panda out. I have had a yelp account since 2015 and have not even wrote my first review until today. I'm tired of going to businesses where employees are RUDE AS EVER WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN THEM THEIR MONEY. It's not only the food that people like but the experience and customer service that they receive when they come into a business.   Let's start out by saying the employee AMRITPAL K. Was very rude when talking to her on the speaker when ordering my food. She was very abrupt and rude when paying for my food at the window and giving me my food. The whole experience there was EXTREMLY DISAPPOINTING and I will never go back to panda again and will be doing a YouTube review of that place."}
{"text":"Drive through person wasn't really paying attention and ended up messing up forgetting my order of egg rolls. Unfortunately I didn't notice until I drove all the way home."}
{"text":"Panda express is okay. Not something I will ever suggest to eat but at this location it's HORRIBLE. The noodles nor the rice were fully cooked. Food was really nasty here. I will nevee come back to this location."}
{"text":"Stopped at this restaurant around 7pm because everything around was really busy. And after ordering and getting our food I know why! Service was terrible. Simple orders were not served as asked, server just dumped the wrong selection out and put the correct in the same container. Employees acted like they were on some other planet. The selections with the exception of one or two entrees looked like they had been sitting out for hours. Food was barely warm at best. There were no trays for eating in. We were not offered any condiments or utensils. I would not recommend this Panda Express location to anyone"}
{"text":"The worst Panda Express ever. My wife ordered beef and broccoli to go and out of the whole plate I couldn't find just 3 small pieces of beef. I thought the name is beef and broccoli not broccoli with a bit of beef. Would not recommend to anyone that dish unless you are vegetarian, and vegetarians don't worry , there is no meat in your dish even if the name is beef."}
{"text":"My last visit I pointed out that the meal portions could be bigger. On my second visit I noticed that had improved. The staff appeared friendlier and very welcoming.  Glad to see our opinion counts.  We will sure continue to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"I cannot complain. I ordered online at 4:15 and scheduled to pick up my order at 5pm. Walked in during a rush at 510 went straight to the front of the line and my order was waiting for me. Everything was still hot and juicy when I got home and the portions were great. It was pretty tasty as well."}
{"text":"This location has the worst service I've ever experienced.  I ordered online, because I love ordering online, it's convenient and fast.  I get to this particular location at around 11AM.  I go to pick up my order through the drive thru like any other fast food restaurant that I've ordered from.  There are zero people in the drive through in front of or behind me.  I let them know I am there to pickup my online order and am immediately told, \"I can't give you that, you need to come inside.\"  What?  Why?  I let her know, \"No thanks, just give it to me at the window I don't want to come inside.\"  She refused again to give me my order.  I wasn't sure if there was a language barrier issue her english was struggling, so I let her know again, it shouldn't be an issue, it's already paid for, should just be a simple thing to grab it and pass it to me.  Finally the manager had to get involved it took him literally 10 seconds of conversation to verify my order and give it to me.  Why was this an issue?  I probably could have gotten over the weirdness of this encounter if the drive thru lady didn't have such an awful attitude and flat out bad service.  I dislike being told I can't have something I've already paid for.  I won't be going back to this location ever."}
{"text":"The staff here were wonderful. Even on a horrible rainy day their spirts were high and friendly. They went out of their way to make people laugh and made sure that everyone on the floor was doing good. Above and beyond what they're required to do."}
{"text":"Nice people and the guy that served me was great. No issues and very clean. One of the better pandas and you can't beat the location.. sorry everywhere else..."}
{"text":"I work in this area and have become a regular here. I am usually not a fan of Panda but the food at this location seems to be more fresh that others. The staff is always friendly and offer you to try their new dish. I wanted some rangoons but I like them fresh out of the cooker. When i hesitated the gentleman offered to throw some fresh one in for me at bring them to my table. This is not typical of a fast food place."}
{"text":"Super fresh and always good! I love this location..great staff!  My favorite is the walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"Every other day that I come here they always have my orders right but today, may 23rd, the fucked my order up and made me wait 10 GOD DAMN MOTHERFUXKING MINUTES AS WELL! All I wanted was WHITE RICE AND DOUBLE (DOUBLE!!!) ORANGE CHICKEN MOTHEFUXKERS!  Not THE FUXKING RICE WITH THE VEGIES !     Sorry for my anger, they didn't even give me double orange chicken and paid 10$$$!!!  Next time you fuck with my order, IAM Rollin with a FUXKING 40"}
{"text":"The GM and the associates are great always, always fresh food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Well, it's a Panda Express. If you've had one, you've had them all. One thing I didn't like is that they had half of the restaurant seating closed off because they had cleaned it and they didn't want anyone sitting there before closing. Kind of lame. Other than that the food was just OK as usual. On the bright side, there's a Krispy Kreme next door!"}
{"text":"For some reason this location doesn't believe in their drive thru. The lines are always so long and they just take their time inside that they don't care. You could order only a side and still wait 5-10 minutes before they give you the food"}
{"text":"Food was amazing however the staff was uninviting.  We waited 15 minutes before someone took our order. They were more worried about the drive thru then the long line at the counter. Ýolanda was rude and down right ignorant to myself and my 86 yr old Mother. Never cracked a smile. She left our food on the counter and when we repeated asked for it she walked right passed us. I had to raise my voice repeatedly to get her attention.  The restaurant was very dirty also.  We spoke to Mariah who was very kind and listened to our concerns outside where we sat. I won't be going back and I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here either."}
{"text":"Came here because my son loves Panda Express. While I was waiting in line, some guy that was already eating decided to cut in front of me to switch his order. I said something to the point where Irene heard what I was saying, and I told the man to get in line. Irene not only accepted him before me but had a shitty attitude when she had to serve me. This is not customer service and is unacceptable.  This location is always packed and the customer service is always horrible.  Irene definitely needs a few classes a customer service."}
{"text":"Came here at 4:00 pm, the place wasn't busy but they hardly had any food ready. Had to wait 10 minutes for chicken teriyaki,  beef with broccoli or fried rice!"}
{"text":"nice staff -- did have to wait as requested portions were low in quantity --BUT that provided freshly made servings.  Food was excellent -- waiting ten or so minutes was worth it."}
{"text":"Everytime I order beef with broccoli the number of beef keeps decreasing. Today I got 3 pieces... last time I got tons of broccoli with only 1 piece of beef :("}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not even going to bother talking about the food because reviewing the food at Panda Express is like reviewing the food at any other fast food joint. It was good and filling, but the thing about this location that makes me not want to come back is the customer service.  My friends and I came in at 9pm on a Sunday night. We could've gone anywhere closer to one of the friends' house like In-N-Out or Cane's, but we chose something different. We walk in, there's one person in line, one employee cleaning the glass where the food is, and several other employees running around behind the register.  The three of us knew what we wanted, and were paying separately, hence why we didn't go through the drive thru, The people at the register pay for their meal, and instead of the employee who was helping them asking us what we'd like or if we'd been helped, goes and starts talking to the other employees. After loudly mentioning we had been standing there looking at the food for five minutes without any assistance, that employee comes over to ask if we'd been helped.  It's not like we had been wearing camouflage and blended in to the restaurant, and it's not like we had been sitting there wondering what to get, so I can't imagine why we had to still wait after the customers in line had left minutes ago."}
{"text":"I just want to make an appreciation post for 2 employees Noel, and Melissa who keeps a positive attitude, with great customer service during a huge dinner rush. Always great to see great service with people with smile on their faces. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went here once and it was perfect. No line in the drive thru at 3:30pm. I got a panda bowl with sweet fire chicken and there were at least eight pieces which is unheard of at a Panda. It was all very fresh and I couldn't have been happier. Based on the other reviews this panda seems to have a problem with consistency. That or they've turned their act around. Based on my experience I say give them a try. Great location in the middle of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Why is the king pao always burnt? First time thought it was a fluke. Second time, same deal. Third time - same. I've been getting the Kung pao for years at other panda's and I've never had it burnt- but for some reason this location can't get it right. seriously- you need to train your staff better."}
{"text":"This place is local, has ample seating area and great food. We've had almost everything on the menu and it's always nice. Favorited are orange chicken, green bean chicken breast, and for spicy lovers: Kung pow chicken! Always good service and if you're looking for something they're out of the kitchen will make you son if you're willing to wait a couple minutes (trust me it's worth it). The guys in the back are solid. Anyone can appreciate their beautiful looking prep freezer! Also the spring rolls and chicken egg rolls are yummy!"}
{"text":"So at 8pm we arrive... wait in line for 20 minutes for THREE people ahead of us. There were two women on the line and two visible chefs. More than half of the food was not made, about half of what was left was old and barely left in the pan. By far one of the worst experiences we've ever had at panda. Service was so slow, uninviting and the food looked gross. I have worked in customer service/restaurants for 6 years now. Get it together panda."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since being in the Charlotte area. The first visit was 30 minutes before closing and the second was as soon as it opened for lunch. Both times the food was fresh and very good! The employees were also very nice and welcoming! Mary was especially on top of things when it was busy."}
{"text":"Terrible manager, as I asked for more meat instead of broccoli, she give me more broccoli. Terrible customer service every time I'm there they're rude and suck."}
{"text":"Well I brought my $10 gift card in, and the girl couldn't figure out how to apply it and told me there was $0 balance on it....  Panda corp called me again confirmed there was $10 on the card and that the employee did not know how to apply it, said they called the location to make sure they now know how to accept this kind of gift cert.... Frustrating all around experience."}
{"text":"It's ok. My son loves the teriyaki chicken so we go about once a week for a box. I am not a fan. I think the quality of food has gone done over the years throughout the whole chain of Panda Express. And they only sell flavored tea. Yuck."}
{"text":"I arrived at panda at about 9:30 pm on Sunday 8/28. The cooks gave us dirty looks and walked away. Finally , the server came up & was very nice . A lot of the food was put away, but that's understandable since they close at 10. Server was really friendly, but then I see the cook scratching his face so hard it became red & continued touching the counters and pans . I was disgusted but I was already paying. I ate the food & it was dry but like I said they were gonna close soon. Well, thirty minutes later, I had the worst cramps of my life. I then went home and was stuck in the ladies room for two hours. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"It's the huge chain stores with low ratings that I'm especially compelled to write something about, mainly because the only people that would actually write something are those that are bitching about the place.  Having stayed at Elara multiple times which has allowed me the ability to walk here in 5 minutes or less, Panda has come in clutch every time I needed food quickly and at an affordable price. Despite being in Miracle Mile, the prices are more or less the same as you would find at any Panda. Food is always fresh and staff is always friendly. I'm always in and out of here very quickly, which is exactly what I'm looking for when I come here.  Bottom line, I know there are better food options in Vegas. Panda is only ever used when I need food quickly. And this is always the case when I come here!"}
{"text":"I remember feeling hungry upon arrival (well, nothing new there), so Hubby took me here to have something to bring back to the room. I couldn't really order well because I didn't see seafood on the ready to go menu. So I ordered rice and vegetables. It was ok. It stopped me from being hungry again."}
{"text":"I came today craving some orange chicken and what I got was hard fried dry orange chicken I then asked if u could get more sauce and she just gave me another small plate with more orange chicken that had sauce on it nd that's not what I asked for I just wanted sauce I don't see why it's a big deal to give out more sauce when it should have sauce already not dry nd nasty I mean even the fried rice was dry and hard it never seems to amaze me when I come nd try to get good food it turns out not good they really need to better everything or I will really go out of my way to go to a different one"}
{"text":"Standard Panda Express food.  Did find what appears to be a small bone chip in one of my chicken entrees tonight."}
{"text":"They charge about 1.50 more per combo than the normal Panda Express anywhere else but this is still OK for a quick, cheap-ish, healthy-ish meal if you're staying right nearby (Harrah's, Best Western Casino Royale, etc.). As long as you can withstand the temptation to pile up the chow mein, Beijing beef and orange chicken and get some grilled meats and veggies in there instead! Portion size is normal for any other location, and they do honor the \"free entree with survey\" receipt coupons here.  Not much of a line on a slower weeknight and they are good about giving you samples too. Was hoping to run into Chris Crispy loading up on his pre-debate carbs but I guess I was a little too late :("}
{"text":"This is fast food Chinese . Most dishes are deep fried but it's quick and reasonably priced. Best dishes are orange chicken  being beef and king pay chicken,  add a little chow me in and you have a  De ent meal"}
{"text":"Not really sure why the first review of this was so negative as it sounded like a general hatred for Panda Express, not this location... Oh, well.  I've been here several times and each time I receive over-the-top customer service.  Stand-alone Panda Express establishments don't even come close to the energy and helpfulness of this one inside Vons.  One REALLY great point -- towards closing time / after closing time they run specials on their food, like buy one get one free.  This is FABULOUS if you're a leftovers person like I am.  I've literally had 3 full meals for $7 because of this special.  Since the grocery part is 24 hours and they are not, it allows them to announce these over the intercom to current Vons patrons.  Genius.  The food?  It's Panda Express.  It's pretty fresh.  And it's pretty darn tasty.  Is it P.F. Chang's? No, but it IS a fraction of the price and very convenient."}
{"text":"This location is great. The only issue is the 3rd item box needs to be a little bigger. Friendly staff and the food tastes great"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!! But how the hell does a Chinese food restraint run out of chow mein on a weekday at lunch time. Get your shit together. I don't see any managers. Must be nice."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Just few customers.. they don't care. And bad attitude to the customers with babies. I don't bring my kids here Panda anymore."}
{"text":"The line here is always ridiculously long and wrapped around the tables. Line seems long more from the lack of organization behind the counter. Employees normally seem confused like they don't know what to do next. It has to be the structure or lack of training because I have been coming here for a long time and nothing has changed except the employees. Old or new employees and it's always the same. I finally walked in yesterday with only 2 people in line ahead of me and it was worse! There were literally about 7-8 employees behind the counter but only one was taking orders, making the orders, and ringing up the food at the register. She took each order, made the plate and walked to the other end to ring it up. So she was handling the food and money while we waited for her to finish doing that for the two families in front of us. No one else ever attempted to assist her. They stood around talking. One was even doing something on her phone in the corner. Please get it together."}
{"text":"I love the bomb Teriyaki Chicken and Orange Chicken. I visit this location once a week and have always received friendly service. I love Panda Express long time!"}
{"text":"All the employees keep their heads down no contact with the customer.  Stood in line attempting to order. No one wanted to take an order walked out without food"}
{"text":"Awful. The lady needs to slow it down she didn't even let me talk she kept talking over me. Then when I started to eat the food was cold.. Ridiculous.. I'm never coming here again..."}
{"text":"As much as we love Panda we will no longer support your Panda in Avondale at the corner of Avondale and Van Buren.  We showed up in the drive -thru no answer so we drove to the window and the workers only looked at us.  We continued to try to get their attention but all we got were looks and laughter.  After honking several times we finally got someone to the window with a clueless face of how can we help.  We decided to leave since this business doesn't understand customer service.   Looking for a new Panda to go to."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I went in and one particularly worker was in an extremely bad mood and you could tell. Made my experience feel really akward. And on top of that my orange chicken was cold. Plain awful."}
{"text":"This place sucks.The employees are stupid and mostly always mess up your order even when youre the only costumer there. If I could I would give it zero stars."}
{"text":"Today I ordered the fried rice with Orange Chicken and Bejing Beef all of which was good. As my drink I choose the Panda Passion ice tea which was ok but not the best. The water would have been better if it had more than lemons in it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chinese spareribs with the Beijing Beef as well as the teriyaki chicken, And I was sorely disappointed. The Beijing Beef was very good but the spareribs and the teriyaki chicken were not that good. The fried rice was good and among the drinks that I had was water with strawberries. The Panda passion Iced Tea was not that good."}
{"text":"When I'm feeling like a Panda bear, this is my place to to get my grub on!! fast, friendly and oh so tasty!!! Yoshi!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot considering it's right near the college that I attend. Pretty clean atmosphere but not enough staff for the amount of people who come in the door. It took about 15 minutes before we were served. The lady behind the counter was really friendly though and handled it well. She apologized. Could have been a 5 star if they were not so overwhelmed and understaffed."}
{"text":"One star for this Panda experience, but I knew the job was dangerous when I took it, and hey that's on me."}
{"text":"Brought my son here for lunch. Usually the service is excellent. This time I was disappointed. Only had chicken dishes. Steamed rice was done Okay. Maybe it was too early.   I get it. But the service wasn't up to par this time.   Extremely slow. When my son got his Rangoons they were hard so I requested that they change it."}
{"text":"Ordered online and this time no issues. My food was ready for pickup as soon as I got there. No waiting like my previous visit. Food is still great. Family loves the food. Thanks for improving your service!"}
{"text":"I'm stunned by how clean and modern this place is. I'm a bit of a foodie snob so It's my first time dining at a Panda Express.  In the middle of running errands My husband & I were hungry so we wanted to grab a quick bite to hold us over until dinner. We were greeted immediately & surprisingly the food looked fresh. Only thing is the food wasn't too hot I like my food fresh and hot. I would probably be back again if I'm craving American Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Every time I come I have high expectations and I'm always disappointed after eating the food. The sauce is way too spicy and the rice has zero flavor and the orange chicken has too many hard parts. The other pandas I have gone to are much better. This location is right next door to me but I rather go all the way to 19th Ave then here again. Also teriyaki chicken is never ready there's always a wait. This place is disorganized. They should be preparing more when the food tray is half way so that customers don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Who doesn't know about Panda Express?  I have to admit: I first patronized this place because of the cute panda mascot.  Now, I find myself searching for PE when I want a quick Asian-style hit.  It is what it is and sometimes the food could be fresher.  BUT, if you know what you're getting and not expecting 5* authentic Chinese cuisine, then you'll probably be happy."}
{"text":"I was pretty sure they were giving away Panda on the day I went. The line was clear out the door. I've been to Panda numerous times, but this was a first for sure. While my mother-in-law stood in line that gave me lots of time to take photos and videos of the food and staff for Yelp, so overall it was a win, plus everything was super fresh because of the high turnover with the crowd.   Despite being swamped, the staff still asked everyone in line of they wanted samples, and they kept a happy, friendly attitude. It became clear to me why there was a rush. There was a new Shanghai Angus Steak entree available and it was fantastic! It was tender, juicy and extra flavorful. Now, I hate steak. It is not my favorite dish at all. I get the eggplant tofu usually. But this steak was special. It's steak for anti-steak people. No gristle and no fat- hooray!   We also picked up a box of the honey walnut shrimp and orange chicken. Sides were fried rice and noodles. Both of the other entrees were good, but the steak was the star of the show. My father-in-law and husband said the same thing. I will absolutely be back, and next time I'm coming for the steak. Load me up!"}
{"text":"Food was dry and over cooked- it was late so probably had been sitting for some time.  Orange chicken was spicy hot-not sweet.   Was supposed to get a \"free serving\" of orange chicken.  Got a free serving of spicy beef instead.  The fried rice was mediocre at best- something you'd get in a 90-second microwave rice bag.  Don't think I'd go here again.   There are better food places in that area.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Last night I decided to grab a quick bite. While waiting to pay for my food, a cockroach crawled right by my foot. I told the cashier sorry, please cancel my order. This was the grimiest Panda I've been to. Very surprised they have an A grade. Management needs to give some attention to this location that was not busy during a prime time. Maybe the manager from Silverado and Maryland can show them how to run an establishment properly- that location is clean, bright and busy.  I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Good is great but staff sucks! Rude, didn't acknowledge us as we walked in and acted as if we weren't there until I said something to them! Customer service game at this place is weak and very unprofessional!!!!"}
{"text":"This panda always has the best service, I take my food to go because they always give me enough for supper and then breakfast the next day. I really enjoy the chicken mushroom the best, followed by black pepper chicken. I don't make life decisions based on my fortune cookies, but I must admit I do look forward to reading them each time."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. My brother eats here all the time but he told me to to inside instead of going to the drive thru. The young lady took my order through the line rung me up and then proceeded to take the other customers in line order and then once the line was down she packed my to go order. I don't like to wait. I hope the food is good."}
{"text":"Stopped by today to try the newly advertised Beijing Beef. It is advertised as Crispy, Tangy and Tasty. It was limp, no tang what so ever and yes it has a taste, purse sweet. Yucky poopie. Of what can ne expect of Panda Express. The place was clean and the employees very friendly."}
{"text":"Don't do the drive-through. Charge me five dollars for a small box of teriyaki chicken and I didn't even add it to my bag. They didn't give me my receipt either."}
{"text":"Thank you to Hillary at the Parma Panda Express for saving my birthday!!! My fiance was on his way and got stuck in traffic and knowing the store was about to close I called ahead.  Hillary went out of her way to made sure we got our order and was sooooo sweet!!! I know the last thing she wanted to do was stay late, but she did for us!! Amazing customer service!!!! Thank you so much!!!!!"}
{"text":"Orange chicken was good but the fried rice they served was old and burnt! Not good. They should replenish new rice."}
{"text":"WORST Panda Express EVER! Had to wait at the Drive Thru for 20 minutes just to get my order in. Manager gave me 10% discount for the wait which was $.72! Never ever coming back here again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. After the evening dinner rush was done, the place needed time to catch up.  The staff were a little unorganized but still tried to be friendly. For quick Chinese food, this wasn't, but it was tasty. Try getting before most mealtime rushes."}
{"text":"Before a few more fast food options popped up here in the barren southwest, Panda Express was a place we sometimes ended up when too tired to cook or drive far. My husband always tried different items, and I had the spring rolls and cream cheese wontons (no crab meat in these) once. (Then I read on Panda's website that these are fried with meat products. Duh, I know. Kudos to Panda Express for being so forthcoming, though.)  Mike would usually end each meal with, \"Never again.\" Not because the food was terrible, but just because it is fast food, and once that distracting roar of \"Feed Me!\" is silenced, you think, \"Was I really so tired I couldn't make a sandwich? Something less greasy? Tastier?\" The talk of a full tummy, of course, one that has forgotten how good hot, crispy food from anywhere made by other people sounded an hour before.  I have to give this particular Panda Express an A-OK rating, though. One, the interior is always spotless. Two, the staff has always been so friendly and helpful. They are quick to suggest to cheapest way to set up your order, they're patient with slow orderers, and the time I got the wontons, they suggested I wait a few minutes to get something fresher than what was already in the tray.    Also, they close at closing time. It sounds obvious, but if you go in 30 minutes before closing, you will get food. Try that at some other fast food places in this area (especially an unnamed one a few doors down), and you'll be told it's clean-up time. To me, the hours on a restaurant's door - especially a fast food place - are for the customer, not the cleaning crew... something that's particularly important when you may only be there because all of the \"good\" places are closed."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, id say I come here very often and I will keep coming here the customer service is also well I've have very good experiences here the orange chicken and honey walnut is my favorite ! And you should also try it"}
{"text":"While I enjoy there food, most of the time I absoulty despise the online ordering and staff. They are not helpful and rude. I have complained about the online ordering before and nothing changes. So when were crunched for time my family and I will choose one of the many other restaurant's that actually have orders ready. In the last 3 months we have ordered 5 times. Each time we go in we have to tell them we are there for our order. Each time we show up when or after the order said it would be ready. The website and email confirmation both say easy pick up. Both are wrong. While all 5 times the food hasn't been ready 5 of the 5 we had to wait for 6+ people to be helped. 2 times I was late back to work. 2 times, when we went there at 630, hours before they close, they ran out of our food!! How does this happen? What's even more upsetting is that if they would have had Our order ready when it was supposed to be, they wouldn't Have ran out! I will find another Chinese restaurant to go to. Even when you complain to the manager nothing changes. I've tried and tried but enough is enough. Save your time and money!"}
{"text":"Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"15 minute wait EVERYTIME I come through the drive through. Makes no sense. Never coming to this location. Today was almost 29 minutes!!"}
{"text":"The food is always decent as expected for a Panda but the experience is terrible. I went there wanting to grab a quick bite to eat. After seeing the 6+ line in the drive thru and not one customer inside, I decided to just go in thinking maybe it would be quicker. There were at least 8 employees in there and not one customer as I just mentioned. It took at least 3-4 minutes for someone to greet and take my order. Luckily the manager was sitting in the dining area giving an interview and noticed my frustration. He yelled across the room to get someone's attention, where one of the cooks had to come out and greet me. I thought okay... I guess your gonna help me. So I have my order and then an employee named Courtney finally rushes up to help. So she takes over and rushes through helping me. I order teriyaki chicken and wasn't asked for any of the teriyaki sauce and actually ended coming home without any at all. My chicken was not cut in good proportions and some of them where just way too big for me to even bite. Courtney and the cook that started to help me argued over if she should bring out the broccoli and beef or not which I thought was kind of strange. She then rings me up at the register and I proceed to get my drink. While at the fountain she hurriedly rushes behind me to grab a fork so that she could sit and take her break which helped me understand why I was being so rushed. I wasn't too happy with the service I got and probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Which Panda Express in the area has the lowest Yelp rating!  This one does!  This location had either 1) a cheap ass owner or 2) lazy/under qualified management.   Very possibly both.   Same as other reviews have said - they never have anything prepared.   This is my 2nd and last time here.   Today's experience:  Went into the drive through with 5 cars ahead (only 3 before I could order) at 11:30am on a Monday...thinking I got in ahead of the lunch rush and I'll be in and out.    Took 30 min to finally order:  I'll take a plate with brown rice.  \"We don't have brown rice today.\"  White rice is fine, then. Can I get orange chicken and broccoli beef? \"We don't have broccoli beef. We don't have any broccoli cut.\"  How about steamed veggies then? \"We don't have any broccoli cut.\"  What do you have, then? \"Sesame chicken.\"  That's all? \"We're preparing more, but it will take some time.\"  How about teriyaki chicken? \"10-15 minute wait on that.\"  Mushroom chicken? \"We don't have any mushroom chicken.\"  Can I ask why? \"We don't have any.\"  They literally meant they had no other entrees?Fuming at this point, I cancelled my order and left.   Seriously?  I've been to other locations with 4x the customers during lunch rush who constantly churn out food. There weren't even that many customers inside.   Lunch break completely wasted.  Got back to work late and won't get to eat lunch today.    Thanks, (insert lazy + expletive) Panda Express manager, whoever you are.   Take this franchise away from the owner and fire all the managers."}
{"text":"Friendly employees, fast service, and a spacious store make this location stand out among the Panda Express locations I have been to around town. An employee is constantly cleaning the dining area as well so everything is always clean. The food is fresh and consistent with other Panda Express stores, and the warming trays are usually fairly full. I have never seen any trays run out because they usually yell back to the kitchen if something is starting to run low. This location gets busy, but there is never too long a line when I'm here, even during lunch rush."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here. Husband and I gave this place another chance after the last time we went... Mistake, will not be returning.  This time, I ordered the Orange Chicken. Wondering if they even cut the fat off because that's all I'm biting into. Husband ordered the broccoli beef, literally all broccoli. One tiny piece of beef. I thought it was a joke, apparently so.  We really used to like Panda, but this location has been disappointing. Management needs to get it together."}
{"text":"What a sorry of an excuse of an establishment!!! I ordered their a la carte premium entree, walnut shrimp LARGE and paid $15.04 as the cashier gave me the total over the speaker. That's not include the other two side orders. When I arrived home the large was not filled to the top like my other side orders! The brown rice filled ALL the way to the top and the mixed veggies were not filled to the top but more then half. Unlike my LARGE a la carte premium entree (fkn joke) less then half! I expect to get what I paid for obviously not HALF! Please train your employees!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews, I have been coming to this location at least once a month for 2 years and not had a bad experience. I am always greeted when I enter and my order prepared as requested.  I have never dined in, to go only. Food is fresh and tastes great.   I usually get something spicy and have yet to receive an incorrect order.  Even when I get there 10minutes before closing.  I will be back next week for my next take out."}
{"text":"This particular Panda Express has steadily gotten worse each and every time I go there. After today, I won't be returning there and may not any other Panda locations. This place is a complete joke in management and customer service. The food is bad too. Arrived Sunday afternoon at 12 PM to a customer line all the way to the door. Only one employee is taking orders, serving plates, and working the cash register. The other employee was working the drive-thru. It took 25 minutes to take our order. I asked to speak to the store manager (Roger). He wasn't there because he had to go get money - the store had no cash! My wife and I should have walked out earlier along with others. This is the worst Panda in Las Vegas, which I told them upon leaving (verbal sparring with the employee). I wanted a nice lunch with my wife. Instead I got bullshit service, shit for food, and highly pissed off."}
{"text":"Last week, I came by to grab a lunch in this Panda Express location.  Let me tell you....they have exceeded my expectations again.    Before going to the line, I first went to the bathroom. The bathroom was extremely clean and smells super fresh.  I can honestly say that you can eat off the floor.  When I got off the bathroom, the line have gotten longer.  The employees were extremely busy, yet they handled each customers in a professional manners, without loosing their composure.  When it was my turn, the employee greeted me warmly and asked if I wanted fried rice or chow mien.  After choosing fried rice, she then asked me what two entrees I wanted.  I chose Orange Chicken and Walnut Shrimp.  She kindly reminded me that it will extra for the premium entree, and gladly accepted it.  While, one of the employee was scooping my Orange Chicken, she asked me if I wanted some egg rolls or soup.  Though, it was tempting to get them, I felt this was enough for my lunch, so I declined.  Finally, once the entire order was fully gathered by the cashier, she asked me if I would like some condiments like chili sauce or soy sauce, and a drink.  She also kindly asked me if I would like to donate my change (so it rounds up to the nearest dollar), and I happily agreed.  Though, I have mentioned nearly step-by-step of what happened during my visit in Panda Express, it only took me less than 10 minutes from the time I entered the restaurant to the time I left.  This visit only shows how much better the training in Panda Express is.  The food was extremely fresh and flavorful.  The restaurant is spotless.  The employees are efficient and friendly.  At the end, very few fast food chains can compete with Panda Express's freshness of food and quality of service."}
{"text":"This location inside of Red Rock Food Court has some of the worst service I've ever had. The woman serving food was very rude and barely even made eye contact. No name tag, no hair-net, no customer service. She did however have the time to have a conversation with a fellow employee in between asking which entrees I wanted. Eat somewhere else when you're here."}
{"text":"Panda Express is always a great place to eat. My girls love everything they get there!"}
{"text":"This is the worst panda ever. Don't go here. I ordered the broccoli beef and got food poisoning the broccoli had gone bad and was black in some areas."}
{"text":"I have to say I really like Panda Express. Most of them are very good.  Clean and quick. which will always make one happy.  Although they did not have the items that I really wanted, I still got what I liked. They give you a few options on rice and noodles. Nice and hot. Place looked pretty clean inside. Even though they were busy. I got it to go, so everything was great. Parking is a little tough."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Fried rice was poofy and delicious. Had the 2 entree meal with Sriracha Shrimp and Orange Chicken. Orange Chicken was sweet, tasted like General Tao. Sriracha Shrimp was not that spicy. Everything tasted even better with their chilli sauce. Sure to go there again!"}
{"text":"This Panda Express is horrible. Do not ever go past 8 PM. The food looks horrible and they never have enough. I've gone many times and I'm sick of having to wait for them to make more of what I ordered, because they are trying to only make just enough till closing... tonight I finally just left and went to another take-out place. Will never be returning."}
{"text":"I like and use the Panda Express on N power, but this PE is closer to my house so I gave it a try. They were so nasty there I have not returned in over a year and probably never will. I got the feeling if I was non-white I would have been better served. In the 100 plus times I have eaten out in Mesa, this was a first. I am respectful of all peoples."}
{"text":"I've tried several times, almost $8 for a very small portions of food ??? Go to the one on Avondale and Van Buren."}
{"text":"Ok, I know...panda doesn't get high marks very often. But when you are hungry and want something quick it works for me. I had fire roasted chicken and mongoose loan with a side of vegetables instead of the usual noodles and or rice. The veggies and meat dishes were just what I wanted. The food court in the Venetian is very clean and has several fast food options. It gave me a chance to sit down after walking  almost three miles down the Strip on our first day in this \"over the top\" city!"}
{"text":"Fresh food! Sometimes the fried rice is over fried. Great customer service and generous portions."}
{"text":"First time at this location. It seems to be the place to go for lunch on a week day. The staff is friendly & the food fresh, except my potstickers were a little cold."}
{"text":"Went two nights in a row ran out of two different things back to back went around 8 pm both nights. Poor customer service. Didn't have the sauce for my chicken the second time and it looked like they threw my bag on the ground then handed it to me sauce (for a different food) was everywhere!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, very rude, have badattitude, asked for orange chicken anf got like 4 pieces and 3 little ones, my wife ordered teriyaki chicken and gave her few pieces and little teriyaki sauce and wanted to charge for more"}
{"text":"I love their Walnut Shrimp! I tend to get that every time I walk in Panda Express! LoL!"}
{"text":"This Panda Express is very nice. I got some fried rice and double orange chicken for my entrees. Super delish! I also tried the honey sesame chicken breast and OMG can't wait to have it the next time. I was craving orange chicken which is why I got that today lol. Staff is extremely friendly and welcoming, kitchen & dining is very clean. Love this place, my fav Panda Express!"}
{"text":"I visited here about a month ago and was enjoying my food until I had a piece of the sweet and fire chicken breast that literally tasted like it was dipped in the toilet. I threw up and couldn't finish my food. I haven't been to a Panda Express since. Hopefully one day! That chicken had to have been really old.  I've been eating here for 6 years and never that that problem. It is great to see the staff and have them recognize me , unfortunately this ruined the meat for me."}
{"text":"The Food Isn't The Best. Let's be honest, but The one thing is the workers are absolutely awful. This one associate names SARAI....she usually works drive thru. She is nasty and so rude. She does not deserve to work there. She has the WORST attitude and is not customer friendly. Most of the workers throw the food in the bag & it spills everywhere. Sauce and all. Run AWAY from this place. Barely 1 Star! The People are rude & act as if they hate their jobs. They need a WHOLE NEW CREW & fire SARAI."}
{"text":"Will never go here again , we found two long HAIRS in our Beijing Beef , the cooks and servers should wear hair nets smh  i'm traumatized by this experience , having someone else's hair in your mouth is the worst thing that can happen when you're enjoying your food, just ruined my whole appetite....I wish i didn't have to give it a rating to post this."}
{"text":"Nothing like a good panda meal!  Great workers, fun environment... I headed in a couple days ago and got the orange chicken and mushroom as well, its not pf chang, but for the price...ide take it every day!"}
{"text":"Finally reviewing this place after five or so visits.   I don't know what they do but their orange chicken is ridiculously good. I just can't say no and it's the only orange chicken my toddler will touch. That says something, considering she's a super picky eater.   Love the green beans but I wish there was less chicken and more green beans. Give up the veggies you whores! J/k   Glad they've added more seafood options, aka shrimp.. they're delicious. Never fishy, more sweet, salty tangy fatty goodness. I've always believed they have a secret ingredient. Favorites being crispy shrimp, and orange shrimp. Boom baby, the sauces are the key. I've boughten the sauces and cooked it in my shrimp or chicken at home and it's just as good as panda. Especially if your looking for a cheap or healthier alternative then eating Panda Express a lot.   Love the veggies egg rolls. Mine never come out like that at home, so I have to buy them. They practically throw them in my face and scream at them to bite them.  The decor is cute, the panda is adorable, and I love seeing all those fresh ingredients chopped up and in plain view next to the kitchen Near the glass slider. No secrets.   Got to ask for chop sticks, they aren't for grabs cause of those sticky rice handed thieves."}
{"text":"Wow, this place gets packed in the evenings! I stopped by the other night to grab takeout and the line was surprisingly long and nearly stretched to the front door. I had placed an online order and with my luck it wasn't done yet and I had to wait 10 min while they worked my order into the crowded line.  I usually get the same few things here and just switch the order among them: teriyaki chicken, Beijing beef, string bean chicken or sweet fire chicken. To make it a healthier option I usually sub my rice/noodles for mixed veggies and omit any additional sauce such as teriyaki. By doing so I get a more guilt free quick and convenient meal in although I do feel like I get hungry an hour or 2 later because I'm not being weighed down by a bunch of carbs I guess"}
{"text":"SLOOOOOOOOW service no personality then handed my order to the wrong \"not yet paid\"  customer ... So my wife insisted on a refund . Manager looks up at my wife and I and shakes his head at his employee asking . Our food was hot but the hospitality was not"}
{"text":"Just got home from ordering takeout from this Panda Express.  I opened up my teriyaki chicken to find there was no teriyaki sauce on it and no teriyaki sauce was put in a separate container to add either.  So pretty much I just got rice and plain grilled chicken.  Then as I'm cutting up son's orange chicken I notice that there is a hair in his food.... talk about nasty.  So my food is plain and bland and my son now can't eat his because there was a hair in it.  I'm so disappointed. Talk about a waste of money."}
{"text":"The food was good, hot & Fresh. The restaurant was clean and tidy.. The customer service was rude and short tempered.  My cashier acted like I was inconveniencing her when I came back to the register to get my spring rolls and fortune cookies they forgot to put in my order. She added the spring rolls with a bit of an attitude like I was the one who missed something then moved on to the next customer before I had gotten my problem resolved. She ignored me until I asked her for a couple cookies. She handed me one, instead of the normal two I've always received at other locations. I asked for another, and she glared at me, and handed me the second."}
{"text":"It's awesome  Fast service & with a smile the whole time. The food is always fresh & ready The place is clean and it's always well staffed.  They gave me a sample of the new chicken."}
{"text":"Came here today to get lunch to go. They were busy ,but not much waiting time .  They are very well organized.  The food just did not look so appetizing though.             I did get 2 orders to go beef and broccoli and Orange Chicken.                                        It actually tasted better than it looked.     The Choices for sides are noodles, which looked over cooked, fried rice , or white rice. I choose the fried rice. Not too bad though i know it is loaded with too many calories.  But, i was working hard today so i will burn it off. I also got pot stickers and egg rolls both good. Lots of easy parking in the lot, and they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"If you own this franchise you should contact me I would love to show you the potential of this location, this is the most poorly managed Panda Express in the world, not an exaggeration. Should never take 25 minutes in line with 6 people in front of you."}
{"text":"Every single time I go to this Panda they never have entrees ready. Bowls are empty or the food in the bowls has been sitting so long the food is dry and looks old. I just walked out in disgusts. Never going back to this location. Ever! Also the tables are dirty. Place needs a good scrubbing."}
{"text":"Perfect! All the food is fresh. Bowls are filled. The staff is very friendly. Very attentive. Portions are large. This is my favorite Panda."}
{"text":"Poor customer service . I get better service in east vegas. Food was cold . The lady rolled her eyes at me like 10 times cause i said i wanted fresh food that was hot. Sucks cause this is a nice area for such poor service . My brother id a gm for a panda in Laughlin and his store is #1 for a reason"}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, our Panda Express meal was great, especially the chow mein and orange chicken. Yesterday, Saturday, at 5:30 in the afternoon we again bought our takeout from Panda Express, and everything was awful. The chow Mein noodles were dry and tasteless. The orange chicken was dry and had hardened into nuggets that were hard to bite into.       I question the Panda Express definition of \"side.\" I ordered the two-entrée, one-side plate. They place the order in a box with one large compartment and two smaller ones. Guess what? The \"side\" goes in the large compartment, and a REALLY small portion of each entrée goes in the two smaller compartments. In other words, the cheap noodles make up half my order. Actually, my other entrée was the honey walnut shrimp and I was hard put to find a walnut or two, and only four shrimp.      I won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's a family tradition ... what can I say. But this location was fast, clean, and friendly. They were kind and attentive to my food allergies. They didn't mind my request for smaller portions. Fresh for fast food. Nice job."}
{"text":"New place to eat in mentor!!! Don't!  Prices are good food is not.  Was excited at first to see a new Chinese restaurant in town good Chinese food is hard to find but this was the worst.  Food was dry bland and cold.  Employees were not helpful and all had a bad attitude."}
{"text":"I recently just went to Panda Express for the first time this past week. It was actually the first time i have ever had Chinese food. I figured it was about time to try this place everyone chats about. I called up a buddy of mine and he was delighted to go with me, he already loves this place. With his high and mighty talk about their delicious food, i got my hopes up!    When i entered the store it was nice, clean, and organized. The cook was quick to help figure out what i wanted to eat. They had various items to choose from all across the store. I finally settled with orange chicken and fried rice. I picked some simple things for my first try. Although i did try some sort of noodle and a different kind of chicken from my friend. It was surprisingly tasteful! The orange chicken had a sort of different taste that left my tummy fulfilled.     Before leaving i decided that Chinese food was not all that terrible as i pictured. The food was wonderful, although i felt the chicken was too spicy for my taste, i still enjoyed the experience. I would not say it is my preferred food place to go but at least i can now say I have tried it."}
{"text":"Expensive for average Chinese food.  Would not go back.  We will stick to the less expensive restaurants with better food.  I liked the idea of a drive thru."}
{"text":"Ordered online and came to pick up, the cashier was upset bc she didn't get the order and was overly rude while making it. It was early like 1030 and the line was out the door. They seriously only had 2 people working in the whole place. I got home and my order was completely wrong. It was like she just made up what she thought I would want. Ugh never again."}
{"text":"You're better off getting off than going through the drive thru, spent 20+ minutes there. Save yourself the time and get off instead."}
{"text":"Came by at 1215 on Sunday. Had to wait for veggies, no honey walnut shrimp, no beef and broccoli. Might be a good idea to have more options ready at lunch time on a weekend."}
{"text":"Portion size has decreased. Food doesn't taste the same , flooring is off. Shrimp was dry barley any sauce. Way way way too many onions . Guess that's how they make it seem like you have food in the small portions."}
{"text":"Typical fast food Chinese, a hodgepodge of unauthentic dishes but very tasty.  The Chow Mein is over cooked  , greasy and brittle. Not a big fan of the fried dishes . Very tasty grilled chicken and green beans dish."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I have been in there a few times now since I work in the area and every single time I deal with rude staff. It seems like a bunch of high school aged girls who are too worried about their phones and socializing than serving the customers. Very frustrating experience the last THREE times I have been in there."}
{"text":"I hate how this panda ALWAYS mess up my order, anyways always gotta check twice from now on.. But other than that it's alright"}
{"text":"The management at this location needs improvement. I just left this location and it was an absolute mess. First I was in the drive through line. Absolutely no progress happened after sitting there 15 min. I backed up and decided to go inside. Only 1 girl working at the counter. Poor thing. She made the food and rang us up. She was doing her best considering she had no help. I didn't see any adult supervision in the restaurant. Only teenagers. There was food all over the counters.  The kitchen looked disastrous. The cook was cooking food when clearly it wasn't needed as there trays of food just sitting on the counter with no place to put it.  There was no one making plates for the drive through. Explains why I had to leave and go inside. I've never seen that place such a mess. I don't blame the kids working there. It was pure lack of management. The management should have had that place properly staffed. Hoping for improvement or I won't be back to that location. Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant to be exact."}
{"text":"Giving this place a chance to correct some things since they are so new or else I would prob drop it down to 3 stars. I decided to opt for a few entrees to share between my husband & myself. We chose honey shrimp, General tsos & the orange chicken along with chow mein noodles & white rice as a side. All the meat was delicious. The chicken was tender & the shrimp had just the right amount of crunch. All 3 sauces were amazing. My husband enjoyed the rice (although, how can you really screw up rice?) but I did not care for the noodles in the least bit. They were dry & reminded me of cardboard, almost as if they had been sitting there all day but judging by the line I know that was not the case. My major complaint is the entrance. They have an entrance that literally plops you right in the middle if the long line & another door to get into that says pull.... with no handle to pull??? After 3 days of being open I can't believe that was not corrected or even so much as a sign that says to use the other entrance. Over all the price was great (1 \"big\" plate, 1 \"bigger\" plate, 1 chicken egg roll & 1 small drink for $19 & some change) & I would go back. Hoping they correct some of the issues with parking & customer flow."}
{"text":"I was about to order rice but I saw a piece of the walnut chicken stuff in the rice! If a piece of food falls into another dish, pick it up! More importantly, the cross contamination of the walnuts could have killed those allergic to tree nuts! Yes their is the allergy sign but the staff should make an effort to reduce the cross contamination."}
{"text":"Always happy to go get Chinese food at Panda Express! They give you such a large portion you can just share it with two people! I got three items and a large drink for 14 dollars! Yummy food! I am never disappointed with panda! Love it!"}
{"text":"This location has super sweet employees, something I'm not used to when I go into a Panda Express. The food was good and I didn't have to wait long. The only bummer I had here was that they didn't have potstickers. The cashier explained to me that they don't carry them in Arizona stores and then proceeded to hold an actual conversation with me. It was nice to talk to someone who wasn't robotic and actual cared. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review and giving Panda two more stars for their additional of more shrimp dishes on the menu!  I've been getting the Panda Bowl with Peppercorn Shrimp lately - and I have to admit, it's pretty tasty. Like the fact that this dish is made with asparagus as the main veggie ingredient along with the shrimp. More please!"}
{"text":"Maybe if your open til 10:30pm, at 9pm you shouldn't be out of everything and give customers a rude look along with a sigh when they ask for something that should be on the line, ie: honey walnut shrimp and orange chicken. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Came here because I have been craving Panda and was surely disappointed. I got the orange chicken and chow mein and the chicken was cold, and the employees were not really friendly, they didn't give any utensils for my order. Not sure if I would come back to this one."}
{"text":"Been going here on a regular basis just to get something to eat and every time its a different story.  Well this last trip I had the chow mein, egg plant, and pepper chicken, the chow mein noodles were hard and crispy-not soft as they suppose to be; the egg plant and tofu was bad cause the tofu was like eating rocks (cause - sitting in the steamer pan to long.)  The pepper chicken was missing the chicken, but it did have a ton of black pepper balls mixed in with the veggies.  It all boils down to the cooks, some of them are really good and the rest need more schooling.  Chinese food is not that hard to cook, chow mein can stay soft and appetizing with more broth and oyster sauce mix with a little shoyu mixed in.  Same for the egg plant and tofu--more sauce."}
{"text":"The 2 stars I'm giving are more for the customer service at the drive thru than the actual food. Everyone that passes through the drive thru should be treated politely and acknowledged, not ignored. I go here often because it's relatively close to where I live. This lady, I won't say a name, is always rude. I hope other people's experiences are better than mine."}
{"text":"Andrew G. did a very good job - listened to what I needed and offered me a sample of the new shrimp item. He was polite and actually ended up ringing me out too! A good asset to your team in Mesa."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly and rough employees.  The worst service ever ... Like: hurry up and go stupid tourist...  Such unfriendly people shouldn't work in the service.  5pm 11/27/16"}
{"text":"Don't go here I found a nasty gum wrapper with gum cooked with the vegetables and it looked like cabbage. Disgusting."}
{"text":"My orange chicken was dry like it had been sitting there for a while. My noodles were almost cold. Never going back. Yuck, I wish I had gone to firehouse subs instead."}
{"text":"Quick place to grab a bite while at Meadows Mall. There is usually a line during lunch but it moves fast compared to some of the other places in the food court. The food trays are usually full and the food is fresh for a Panda Express. Generally in and out at this location with no problems"}
{"text":"Shit. Shit. Shit. Food was disgusting. Customer service was disgusting. Employee uniforms were disgusting."}
{"text":"Every time I come here they mess something up. Last time was a whole lot messed up with just a One plate order. I call them, they said they can replace it. Cool. Head there. Got it. Came home. And I just hate the fact that the replacement food for my messed up order was shittier than my last order."}
{"text":"Not very sure whats wrong with this place but every time I go in everything its terrible I Went Tuesday with my family through the drive thru and I waited 25 min in line . When I got to the window the poor little girl was running around making food taking orders cashing out,  all by  herself . I was late debit she handled it very well.  She apologized for the wait and offered us all free drinks while being very sympathetic which is probably the only reason I didn't go back and throw a fit because When I got home my orange chicken was disgusting and rice was raw . Went back today after my sons baseball game and  didn't even order after seeing everything disorganized and a huge line very disappointing because this use to be out favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Came in 2 minutes before close by accident, Sydney was super sweet and accommodating. Great customer service. No one made it seem like a big deal we got there so close to closing time."}
{"text":"Food was excellent (black pepper chicken bowl with veggies) and reasonably healthy for a fast food place and it's been a while since I've seen customer service as good as I received from Hector. Kudos to him. :)"}
{"text":"Hours were not as specified. My flight landed at 7:15 and I got to the panda express by no later than 7:30. They were already packed up and closed. The yelp hours stated that they should be open till 10:30 pm on the Tuesday night that I was here."}
{"text":"I've been to pandas all over the place and this one was impressive. It was clean and the workers were friendly and efficient. Most fast food places have employees that can't seem to be bothered to do their jobs but this wasn't like that at all. Also impressed the manager/shift leader jumped in to help when the lunch rush got busy. Smiles all around!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Panda locations I've been to.   My experience here for lunch with my girlfriend was good. She ordered a panda bowl and I had the 2-entrée meal. Both of us were happy with our meals generally. For me, the broccoli and beef wasn't the greatest, but it was a good lunch overall.   The service at this location is prompt and friendly. When we arrived, the line wasn't very long and the servers were changing out some of the items that had been sitting there. So we were getting the freshest possible. I always appreciate that.   The location isn't bad either. Coming off the 101 (going south), just head left and when you get close, make a right into the plaza. The parking is a little congested, but not as bad as some of the places nearby."}
{"text":"Always good and fresh! I work at the OfficeMax in the area and these people are fast and friendly.."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda Express I have ever set foot in the employees are rude the food was under cooked and for complaining I was kicked out of the store if I could give zero stars I would"}
{"text":"If you're a local, and going to the Red Rock to see a movie, and just want or crave this, it's okay.  If you're a tourist visiting, I'd say \"c'mon, you can do better than this!\" not to disparage the quality of the Panda Express franchise, but it's a chain fast food restaurant that isn't that cheap.  Your all-in price with a drink is going to be around $10.  Spend a few more bucks within the Red Rock Casino and you can get into the buffet which has the same Chinese food, and greater diversity without limit (all you can eat and drink).  Also, the cafe in the Red Rock has deals like a T-Bone steak for $10.  However, if you like reliable, consistent Chinese food, and like Panda Express, this is going to be a predictable experience that won't wow nor disappoint you, just deliver what you come to expect.  It's a good clean spot, with nice service, so no knock on Panda Express at all."}
{"text":"The food is good, if they're not out of what you want. I can also take you 45 minutes to get through the line and because of the way the drive thru lane is set up only the last person in the lane can leave.  And when you you get home there's a decent chance that you didn't get what you ordered."}
{"text":"Came to pick up an order here. Usually have to wait for the customers that are in line before the online orders which is kinda annoying. I think they should do them together if I'm waiting there more then 2 minutes. The inside looks cute. They even have 2 tvs but nothing was playing  I was hoping the olympics at least."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been at a Panda Express in over 25 years. I was in Huntersville and needed something quick. There were some other restaurants (Thai and Chinese ) that were close but I didnt have the time.   I got chicken and mushrooms and kung pao with mixed vegetables. The kung pao was nice and spicy. The chicken and mushrooms were kinda bland. The mixed vegetables were pretty good .   It served its purpose decent food in a quick manner.  Next time I'd make more time for the Asian restaurants around Birkdale."}
{"text":"The service was probably the best I have ever received for any restaurant. From the server, to the cashier, to the cook - absolute 10/10 customer service - so friendly.   I had asked if they had more beef and broccoli as there was only a small portion of broccoli left on the hot plate, and they cooked a new batch for me, no problem. The beef and broccoli were cooked to perfection.   However, the chow mein noodles and the other meats we had (orange chicken and Beijing beef) were underwhelming (not bad by any means, but just meh). They really need to get more carb options such as Shanghai or rice noodles. They only had fried rice or chow mein. Although I haven't tried any other locations, I feel this is an issue for the company, rather than the actual store."}
{"text":"Never going back. My son got food poisoning. I've been up all night (currently 3:25am) because he keeps vomiting and now has to miss school. He got the chow mein with orange chicken and an eggroll (not a spring roll) with sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"Definitely the best experience I've ever had at Panda. Sean has outstanding customer service skills, he made sure to greet every guest as they walked in and made each order a personal experience while quickly moving through the lunch crowd. The whole staff did great! Super friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Panda is a solid choice for lunch.    They were packed today.  Menu boards have been changed since the last time I was hear - almost like they're trying to affect the appearance of a mom-n-pop \"$1 Chinese food\" shop - austere white signs with black text and little imagery.    Got my standard - Orange and Kung Pao chicken with chow mein.  Have to order water to drink, because both their iced tea options are flavored."}
{"text":"Not one table clean and place is empty! Told lady worker coming out of bathroom, ugly look and no comment! Place is cold as a freezer! Drink station wet and nasty! No entrees ready, had to wait !  It's lunch time so no excuses!!"}
{"text":"Typical Panda food, which I always enjoy. The problem tonight was that I waited for the chow mein to be cooked, which was not a problem. But when they passed the plate with my order written on the back to the cashier, he placed his hands on the surface of the plate after handling cash.  The food was then placed on the plate and they called me to pick up my order. I hope I don't catch anything... Maybe a health code violation?"}
{"text":"I want to give this place five stars cuz the food was damn good it was free with my T-Mobile Tuesday so I got me and my daughter had sweet and sour chicken with rice  again for free and I would go back again and buy the food but if I went to any other restaurant I can get the lunch special with sweet and sour chicken with an egg roll combination for $5:50 just saying  pretty good stuff"}
{"text":"Came in at 11:30, half an hour before closing time. They were out of everything and Richard refused to make anything fresh for the long line of customers they had. I was starving so I just chose some other items that weren't my first choice. Paid $12 for my food only for it to taste like it had been under a heat lamp for 6 hours. Literally tasted so bad I couldn't eat it. When another few girls went up to get food I told them not to waste their money because none of it was fresh. Richard and Melojane stood their behind the counter loudly talking crap about me knowing I was right there and could hear them. Bottom line.... don't waste your money. Go upstairs... McDonalds nuggets are always fresh."}
{"text":"Please, Please praise Nelson, the Store Manager!!!!  Nelson is the only reason, I dine in our town's Boulder City store. I have been to numerous other Panda Express locations in Henderson/Vegas and Nelson is amazing!!! I am a Vegetarian and my family isn't. He will always come over and check that my family and I are being treated well. I also hear other customers, speak highly of Nelson's service adn warm smile!!  He is always so kind about asking to make me fresh Stir-Fry Veggies and if I have enought food.  The store is always kept meticulously clean too!!!   The rest of the staff is also very friendly and courteous. Very friendly place!!!"}
{"text":"This location is just below standards. Employees really hate their jobs and people. There that little old hispanic old lady, shes just rude and i don't think she knows how to smile. Theres is always a humongous line and its because 2 or 3 employees man everything. They need two cashiers not 1 and more than one person in each side of the serving station.   I have saved time by ordering online. But the issue is that both times the containers have a lot less servings than if you were there being served in person. Almost like they do it on purpose because you ordered online.   I would skip this Panda and go elsewhere. Not worth waiting their ling lines and dealing with their rude employees.  P.S - two packets of hot sauce for 2 plates is not enough but the sure think so here."}
{"text":"I went here on two occasions. On the first, the man who took my order was extremely inattentive and he loaded my 2nd entree with food that I did not order. I just had to settle for it as it was take-out and I was already late when I got to Panda. I came back today and made sure that the man who took my order was not around to take my order again. i was attended to by someone who turned out to be worse than my first experience. I was supposed to order 3 plates and I clearly told her I wanted 2 entrees on each plate. She did one plate and immediately started taking orders of the guy who was next to me in line without bothering to check if all was right with what I ordered and if there were other things I still wanted to order. Clearly she was the most inattentive work person I have ever countered. After the guy who was next to me ordered I politely told her I still needed to order 2 more and she asked me what the entree was and she just scooped out what I ordered and put it in a bowl. I ended up with 2 bowls instead of a total of 3 plates.  By the way the guy who was supposed to follow me also complained to the cashier because he was also being charged for the first plate which is what I ordered. A cashier named Rufina was also \"confused\". I politely asked Rufina what the name is of the lady who took my order and she at first asked \"Why \" and was obviously hesitant to tell me her co-worker's name. She even said it's on her ID and I can see it for myself. After I insisted, she gave in and she told me that lady's name is Alondra.  This reflects a really bad image for this Panda Express. I do not know if the woman who took my order is new but Panda Express must be very meticulous when releasing people out to the floor. The food is great BUT the INATTENTIVENESS and Lack of Focus of the food server casts a really bad light on this branch and on the standards that Panda Express may want to uphold themselves to.  The food server was in a rush to do the job that she commits blunders in the process and irritates the heck of customers unfortunate enough to experience all these."}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty busy. Almost no tables. The food smelled and looked fresh. The staff was alert and eager to please."}
{"text":"Holy slow service, absolutely no food was made. It took 25 minutes for them to help three customers, while our food sat on the counter that we ordered. This location needs a ton more staff or new employees!"}
{"text":"Drive through is supposed to be quick right? yeah, horrible idea for a panda express. This is the slowest drive through ever... ever! i waited 15 minutes the other night and hand to call the store to check on my food. Ridiculous. The food tastes great but the customer service and wait time has to improve. I dont care how good the food is, if i have a crying hungry child in the car for 15 minutes I'm not going to be a fan of your establishment."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever seen at a panda , won't smile are not friendly . even when u say thank you . they will not even look at u . ill never come to this one again ."}
{"text":"The pricing is great and the food tastes pretty decent. Chow Mein and Rangoons seemed over cooked. Restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"There are plenty of vegetable only dishes at Panda Express and this is no different than any other location. Check it out in 2010.  Constistently fresh and flavorful.  Also today 3-10-10 - free coupon for Honey Walnut Shrimp http://www.pandaexpress.com/px/Facebook/HoneyWalnutShrimp_Wed031010.html"}
{"text":"Soo disappointed. Got my food for lunch, I work near by.I never call and complain, but I had to.the food was old,you can clearly taste it. They had just opened at 10am, so why would there food taste old, as if it were from last night .I couldn't even finish it. They wouldn't give my money back , and they seemed non interested in the fact that a customer was not happy.  Please talk to your crew, I'm sure if they came to my place of business and the same happen to them, they would feel how I felt MAJORLY DISAPPOINT!   I didn't even get a darn apology smh."}
{"text":"Truly awful service at this Panda.   I stopped in for an early lunch one day and there were a few people in front of me. From the time they ordered, to when they asked me for my order was nearly 10 minutes. No kidding.   The gal at the front decided it was time to do something else when it was my turn to finally order and walked away, leaving me there for several minutes. The old couple behind me even looked at each other like \"what's going on?\", before walking out the door without ordering.   When I did finally order, the chicken wasn't cut very well, making it hard to eat with the rice as I had to re-cut it again in order to make the long strips into bites I could eat. Overall, the service was bad at this location. Angry faces, poorly trained staff, and dirty tables all over.   You've got to be kidding me.   P.S. I'm fairly certain I already wrote this review, but for some reason it disappeared. I will keep writing it if this one disappears as well. Folks should know when a place is awful. And this Panda Express fits the bill perfectly."}
{"text":"Even though the same basic types of alcohol are served in different bars, not all bars are the same. Some bars have bartenders with heavy hands and some don't. It can make or break the experience.  Well, the same idea applies to chain cheap eateries such as Subway, Chipotle, and of course, Panda Express. Some servers have heavy hands and some don't. It can make or break the experience.  Luckily, the staff here has (very) heavy hands. It made my day and broke the button on my slacks."}
{"text":"When it comes time to Las Vegas, two days is nice, three days is perfect, four days is excessive, and five days merits an intervention.   In January, I spent 11 straight days in Las Vegas.  For the record, I wasn't there because of a midlife crisis, messy divorce, falling in love with a stripper, gambling problems, alcoholism, or drug addiction. But clearly, a few of those might have played small roles. By the way, my therapist tells me I like to minimize.  I was there for work. But when I wasn't working, I had to eat. And sometimes, there's a rumbling in my tummy to get wasted, black out, and do unspeakable acts. And sometimes, I just crave Panda Express.  Unfortunately, the Chinese guy behind the counter makes an embarrassingly small plate of food. He scooped up a bunch of greasy chow mein and then adorned the plate with three little pieces orange chicken and maybe two pieces of honey walnut shrimp. And he served this atrocity with a smile on his face. I was so annoyed, I threw the plate at his face and poured hot & sour soup all over his body. Okay, that totally didn't happen. But the thought crossed my mind. Clearly, I need more therapy.  Instead, I ate my greasy snack and then walked across the street to McDonald's for a proper meal."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised yesterday when I stopped in the Avon, Oh Panda Express (PE). Normally I try to avoid fast food chain restaurants but when your hungry and there are few other options close by you roll the dice and hope for the best. I'm giving it a weak 4 star review. I will not claim to be a fan but it is better than A-OK.   PE is in a new free standing building on 83 just north of I-90. First time I've seen  PE outside of a mall food court. The building and interior had a clean modern look, better than some of the sad looking mall locations. The restaurant was clean looking and I do like seeing a clean prep and cooking area behind the counter.  Ok, to the actual dinning experience- greeted right away and had a short wait in the quasi buffet line while the counter person helped a couple before me with thier order. Decided to go with a bowl, the smallest order size, of Hunan Beef over fried rice. The Hunan Beef had a hot pepper logo on the menu board hinting it was hot/ spicy. Food was served up quickly and I added a bottled green tea for a total of $8 and some change. The cashier asked if I wanted any thing else with my order and offered soy sauce and chopsticks.   My lunch tasted good, better than I was expecting for a corporate chain. As mentioned above the Hunan Beef was supposed to be hot/spicy, it was relatively mild. This was no surprise as most independent stand alone Chinese restaurants seem to be shy on turning on the heat. Portion size was a fair deal for to money. A 4 star rating for this visit seems far when comparing PE against other fast food restaurants such as McD, Arby, Taco Bell and the host of new Sub shops."}
{"text":"The vegetables were soggy. The chicken was slimy. None of the employees spoke English. I called in my order for pick up and had to repeat my order 6 times before they finally understood. The management was super rude when I pointed out to him the quality of the food. The whole store was dirty. Don't go to this location."}
{"text":"Awful. Staff was incredibly slow and incompetent. I had to repeat my order to the same girl 4 separate times. Teriyaki and orange chicken. Each time she just stared off into space for several seconds and then said \"what was that\". Definitely stoned. I hope? Food was average panda, just a little extra soggy and cold.  They couldn't manage to cut the teriyaki chicken so I had giant pieces to try to manage without breaking my plastic fork. Don't do it.  Just get chick fil a or something."}
{"text":"Really nice & clean. Panda Express is delicious! Their orange chicken is my favorite! If you can't decide between the rice & chow mein you can do half/half so u get alittle bit of each. Also you can try samples before choosing what type of meat you would like. The cream cheese rangoons are delicious."}
{"text":"I always come to this Panda Express. It's good. Sometimes they do run out of food when it's close to closing time. Also this panda does deliver if you order from uber eats."}
{"text":"Just like any other Panda in LA, this was a cute place. They had their food in a bowl shape instead of a catering pan.   Anyway we went here after I had a slice at Secret Pizza and my friend didn't feel like eating pizza so we chose Panda. And because we weren't up for the appetite of going on a buffet. I usually get what I get no biggie. I like to sample the shrimp walnut just so I can get a piece of shrimp lol because I know some places count how many shrimp you get like the one by my house. They didn't have the beef aspharagus I wanted to try out but thats ok. Food was hot and ready for my taste buds even if it was American Chinese food.   For those people who complain about Panda OMG, plus your in Vegas every thing is more expensive than other places. As for the shrimp thing, anywhere you would go seafood would be a bit more. And I don't remember egg roll being charged for extra unless it's just a Vegas thing."}
{"text":"Don't believe them when they say the close at 10:30!!.. drove all the way there for them to tell me that they closed at 10"}
{"text":"The food definitely is not as good as other panda location.  The service is definitely not as good as other panda locations. The girls barely speak english, but they do move quick.   Quick lunch it's an ok stop.  The thing that really gets me is they charge 50 cents to refill your soda?  Who does that in this day and age?"}
{"text":"Completely awful. I ordered my food an hour ahead through the new Panda Express app, it's suppose to be faster and more convenient. I go in at my exact pick up time 8:30pm and was told to get in the back of the long line of people ordering. Why? If mine is already ordered and paid for. You're making me wait in line for cold food, I should've just ordered in store at least it would've been hot! Never coming back to Panda Express again, sticking to real Chinese food. And not only that but they were out of the food I ordered when I got there.... I ordered the food an hour ahead of time, they couldn't cook more of my order in that hour?"}
{"text":"This location never gets the order right for delivery. When my bf called to see if they will fix it. the lady on the phone was rude and disrespectful. She wouldn't fix her mistake. We received our refund through GrubHub."}
{"text":"Ok I have two parts to this review.  The first is my recent experience and the second ove what my experience has been like.  The second part had no baring on this review.    I ordered two entree plate, bejing beef and black pepper chicken.  My first problem is the we don't have white rice..8 minute wait...Oh wait we can give you rice now.  My problem is how do you run out of rice or chow mein.  Every dish comes with one of them.  You can see when something is running low so you prepare another batch.  Sigh Ok the food. It was just ok. At its best it's average. It fills that craving when you are too lazy to go to a real Chinese resturant, get out of the car and wait 10 minutes.   This time the black pepper chicken had too much sauce so it had an odd taste to it.  My main issues I have with this place is how disorganized it seems to be.  For example if you use the drive thru if there are 3 or more cars in line if you don't have 15 minutes go some place else.  There is almost always someone waiting 10 minutes for their orange chicken to get done.  The worst was 25 minutes and I was car 4. That's where the disorganized part comes up, 80% of the time I go they run out of something.  I wish they had a spot where cars can pull forward and wait for their food to get ready.    I also stopped getting soda since 50% of the time something was off and it tasted bad.  I guess you can say that actually is a good thing."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have a local Panda Express! I love the chow mein! My children love the orange chicken. Service is very friendly. Just avoid the drive thru, it will take forever."}
{"text":"I have never had less than great service here. They are friendly, fast and accurate. I will say that there have been a few times when I couldn't understand what they were trying to say, especially at the drive thru- but as a whole, I have no complaints....well, except when I ask for ice tea and they omit the ice...but just means more tea for me. I love their iced tea..."}
{"text":"I went to Panda Express for lunch the other day.  There was a long line in the drive thru so I opted to order inside.  Staff member was refilling bowls and greeted me immediately, said she will be right with me.  She also offered for me to try a sample.  I ordered my usual two entree two sides (chow mein and orange chicken) and cream cheese ragoons.  I had to wait a long time for the orange chicken to be refilled (approx. 10 minutes) but as I waited, staff members smiled and apologized for the delay.  It appeared that a manager was training a new cook so it was easy to understand the delay.  Over all, good experience.  This location has good customer service and my food was hot and fresh.  I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Why does this Panda have lower quality than other Panda places? Dual entree is usually my favorite with rice and chowmein and 2 sides of meat, but I gag right away after a first bite of those dried, oily, old chow mein. I don't try other options for the entree because I usually stick with what I'm acquainted with, which is orange chicken and walnut shrimps. Shrimps are good, but orange chicken is all dried out. Please tell the cook not to overcook the starch."}
{"text":"This is a Panda Express. In most respects, their food is consistent with most other locations (and this review is relative to that). With that in mind:  - This is the newest Panda Express I've ever been to, and probably you too. The facility is extraordinarily modern, sleek, and spacious, including plentiful flat-screen TVs. - Every time I've been here they've been very generous with the portions. (for reference, you'll get more here than you will from the Sahara and Hualapai location) - Service is friendly and prompt!"}
{"text":"Unlike some of the other reviews my order of Pacific Shrimp on rice included a generous number of shrimp, however, I would have liked more veggies.  Drive in line was long and slow took 15+ minutes,  I noticed many larger orders, they should have been asked to pull aside or ordered ahead for pickup."}
{"text":"Dear Panda Express on the strip,  I love you. You saved my life the afternoon after coming back to my hotel at 8am. I wake up with the worse hangover feelin like I was in the movie hangover and the last thing I wanted was some fancy Las Vegas restaurant food where I'd have to sit at the table with the whole room spinning than run to bathroom and throw it all up. I needed somethin to hit the spot and make me feel good!! And you were there panda. I turned to my girlfriend and said babe, I need some damn Panda. And as soon as we get back to San Jose were eating some!! And she turns around and tell me, we passed a Panda on the strip. You were too drunk to notice. I innmediately get dressed and stumble my way about a quarter mile down the strip and there you were. Right next to Mcdonalds lookin fly as ever! I opened your doors and it was amazing....only two people in line! You gave me great service and I stumbled my way back to the hotel to fall on the bed and open up my take out box full of rice, noodles, beef and broccoli, and orange chicken. Thank you Panda Express on the strip. You saved my life."}
{"text":"This location is always super yummy, fresh, and friendly service. I am not sure why it has such low reviews because every time I have been to this location over several other near my house it is consistently better than the others. We have been coming to this location for at least a few years. The store seems to always be busy so the food is always fresh. When I go to other locations I always find myself wondering why I chose Panda, this location make me want to chose it again in the near future. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This location is one of my least favorites. If you want good service and hot, fresh food go to the McDowell and Dysart location.This location consistently has less than fresh food and never has the entree selections we would like (and I am not to talking something special here just chicken breast and string bean or chicken and mushroom). It is worth driving 3 more miles and walking in for the other location. After trying this one at least 3 times in the last 6 months an not being satisfied we will always be driving to the other location."}
{"text":"Thought we would give This location another shot to redeem themselves.   This time around was much better food was fresh, service was good.   Cleanliness well tables were a mess, soda area was trashed and men's room need some attention. Now there was someone in working on it and by the time we left it was looking good."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time to get some lunch on weekdays.  There's always a line (which is good cause that means the food isn't sitting out too long- it's being ordered and eaten!) but the employees serve quickly."}
{"text":"This Panda is always pretty busy- especially around lunch time. I don't mind it though because that means that the food is fresh and not sitting out for hours just waiting to be ordered.  My faves are the green bean chicken, the sweet fire chicken, and the chow mein.    FYI- they always offer that you purchase a medium drink which is big.  Just get a small- free refills."}
{"text":"Serious f*** this place. On Monday I had gone and spoke to Michael the store manager about placing a big order worth of $200, and told him I wanted to pick up by 1530 on tuesday. Placing the order and everything was fine, but what was bullshit was the fact that he didn't leave a note for the second shift on Tuesday to let them know to have my order ready by 1530. I get there and guess what the order wasn't done. The employees didn't even know what was I talking about, but thank God to the guy cook that right away started to cook my food which made it a bit better. But the fact that the manager didn't even leave a note about that order and I had to wait for it, was BS!!!  I asked the cook that I wanted their district manager info which he did gave it to me, I called her no answer I email her no answer and to be honest that let's me know that they don't give a dam about their guest. I think that they don't care for their guest what so ever. No wonder you guys have such low scores on here. Seriously this will be the first and last time I eat or order at this place. YOU GUYS (DM, RM) NEED TO MAKE YOUR GUEST NUMBER 1 PRIORITY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, was waiting for the next bus and hungry with 20 minutes to spare, low and behold doors are locked. Nice young  lady comes and opens the door to explain that's the manager was running late and was the person who had to cash in the register, so now the store has opened almost a half hour late and no customers got their food. UNACCEPTABLE! This manager in question is named Jermaine."}
{"text":"Had the walnut shrimp and the steak entrée too. Both were good. Staff was friendly and helpful. Was later in the evening,  so not to busy. Once again it is a chain restaurant, so you know what to expect. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Good service from this location.  Anytime I have purchased a meal from here the food has been great and the order was filled accurately.   The only negative thing is this place tends to be very busy and can take a little longer to get your order compared to other fast food restaurants"}
{"text":"Holy crap talk about shitty service. If you hate your job that much, find another. I wanted honey sesame chicken. I got 95% vegetables and 2 pieces of chicken. Seriously?! NEVER SUPPORTING THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"A bit hard to find if you're a first-timer, this location is inside Vons, at the back of the produce department. Being in a grocery store, it's a very small Panda, with a smaller selection of items. However, all your basics are there, plus the +$1 item du jour.   Employees are completely checked-out and uninterested, but can you really blame them?"}
{"text":"Panda Express food is AWESOME as it ever had been since I tried back in California, When I saw that they were now here in Cleveland, I jumped with Joy!! All was great! Except the employees, they are rude, they made fun of a gentleman just because he wanted more soy sauce in his plate, the girl went to her manager mocking that they did not have gravy at that location! Talk about culture shock for this girl!! Even though I really like Panda Express, I will not return to this location cause of the rude employees! Learn to appreciate your customers and  their culture!"}
{"text":"One of the better airport locations.  They do cook in small batches and so likely you will get something that's decently fresh.  Very limited seating though."}
{"text":"I can feed myself and my two lil kids here for less than $20...and we actually leave full. Food tastes good and remember to tell your 4 year old that the broccoli beef is made from Panda bear meat. People whip their heads around and almost give themselves whiplash when he says \"wow! This panda bear meat tastes soooo good!\" Lol"}
{"text":"Took the in-laws here tonight and dined in.  I have come not to expect extraordinary food from Panda but it usually is not bad.  It's quick and you get quite a bit for your money.  Things must have changed since my last visit.  The portions were considerably smaller.  The take out boxes they were using looked way smaller.  The dinning room was dirty.  The garbages were overflowing.  The lo mien noodles were either undercooked or old.  Either way they were crunchy.  The service was very impersonal.  There were no smiles or anything.  You cannot come to Panda and expect a gourmet experience, but you should expect decent customer service and a clean environment."}
{"text":"They were nice & always offered \"the fresh\" items coming out.  The place was clean & actually comfortable. For once comfortable chairs for a handicap person like me. Their noodles were great and it wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"This Panda's quality is the same as the other than you have never come across a company that is more worried about waste. The owners have instilled a maniacal attitude against making anything other than what is ordered. They are always out of everything and they will always tell you other than in the case of small combos that you have a 15 minute wait.   Look, this is fast food Chinese. Regular good Chinese hasn't got this level of wait. Don't come here unless you have some time to spend."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh And only panda I've gone to where the rice is sticky and they hook you up!! Thank you"}
{"text":"I live next to the one on Nellis but today I stop by this one on the way home from work . Nasty food ! My sons kid meal orange chicken tastes burnt and all extra crispy and thin disgusting ! I've been calling them but no answer , horrible customer service . Will not be back to this location ever !"}
{"text":"Yay a Panda Express in Canada! I thought they were only in the USA, and the Beijing beef has always been my across the border go to fast food. The selection for ready main entrees was almost nil, but you can have anything made to order in under 10 minutes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because our entrees came our fresh and hot and extra crispy. I also tried the orange chicken, which was cold from sitting around, and the honey walnut shrimp which was delicious but a bit too gooey for my personal taste, but I can see why people like it so much. I will be back for more Beijing beef some time soon! I hope they open one more downtown!"}
{"text":"It's Panda Express! Fast food Chinese-ish food. When you're hungry this works."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! This is the first time trying a Panda Express. The guy at the front counter taking food orders was extremely nice and let us each sample something on the menu. The bowl was more than enough for me! They give the perfect amount in portions. We got the orange chicken. It was very good, little bit of spiciness, and no fatty parts! I am usually very weird about chicken in general and especially Chinese/Japanese (or any kind like this) food! Food was hot, fortune cookies were good, service was quick during lunch on a Friday! They were busy but quick, so they never had a line. Dining room was clean and well kept. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have never waited under 20 minutes to get my food. They take forever, run out of everything, and are in no hurry......"}
{"text":"This location is always slow, in the restaurant and the drive thru. Today we order drive thru and both meals which were chicken teriyaki were without the sauce! The chicken was burnt and without the sauce it was absolute terrible. Will be avoiding in the future just not worth the wait and money!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Panda Express I have ever been to. I don't know why but I continue to try the drive thru and every time it fails me. 2pm on a Saturday I waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes when there was only me and one other car In line. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is not a very customer service oriented Panda. Every time I have been in there, they are cleaning grills and do not want to make any fresh entrees."}
{"text":"Horrible Panda Express I've ever been too they only gave me 3 pieces of honey walnut ! And no sauce on my teriyaki chicken ! Worst panda in Vegas !"}
{"text":"The food was great except the kale chicken. Asked for a new plate because it was wilted and burned. When the new plate returned it was filled with metal shavings. The line staff was rude and would not take the kale off the line as I watched them attempt to serve it to another person. Once I got loud she decided pull it from the line. The manager thought the whole thing was funny and blew it off saying \"oh it's just the scrubber we clean with\". After demanding he did refund the order. We received an incident report to fill out only to have it ask for our social security number. What?!!!!! No!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok as expected from Panda Express. Though I felt the quantity here was less compared to the other branches. The orange chicken and the shrimp dish are recommended. Lastly it's ok to eat here for having an economical and ok food."}
{"text":"If you are in a rush but just have to have Chinese, or in my case, have a kid who must have Chinese this will work. It's close to get home, cheap, and fast so once or twice a year we stop in when we are running behind schedule and to grab something quick. The chow mien is better than the fried rice so I added that and teriyaki chicken, and the Shanghai Angus beef to my dinner and my son had a bowl with chow mien and orange chicken. It wasn't horrible but sadly but there was nothing remarkable about it. The chicken had a lot of skin on it which is not appealing to me. The beef was better than the chicken and even had a slight bit of heat.  The service tonight was fast and efficient. We time it perfectly because while we were leaving the line now stretched out the door."}
{"text":"If you're going to head to this Panda instead of others in the area- then I would go at peak hours.  My husband and I went on Tuesday at 8 p.m. only to find that ALL of the trays were practically empty- if not totally empty.  The trays that did have food in them had less than a serving in there- pretty much guaranteeing that we would either have to wait, get something that we didn't really want, or go to another restaurant.  They did just put out a new helping of chow mein and there seemed to be enough orange chicken so I went for a bowl with those two items while my hubs got the chow mein with the kung pao chicken.  I think having empty trays at this time is completely unacceptable.  I wanted the string bean chicken and my hubs wanted the bejing beef but we didn't want to wait.  Further, there were four employees working at the time- one was actually cooking, one was on playing on his cell phone, and two others were eating (meals that they had the cook make in portions for them only- nice).    When we were paying for our meal I slipped in a giant puddle that was escaping from behind the register and was running into the customer area.  The employee playing with his phone behind the counter should have been cleaning that up!  I'm 38 weeks pregnant- had I fallen I would have FREAKED OUT!!!  There was also trash on the floors, the tables looked like they had been cleaned with a dirty cloth (smears and kinda sticky) and the entire experience left much to be desired.    The manager of this store has got to step up their game.  I've been here during the lunch rush and then it seems fine- but unless it's peak hours I would steer clear.  Had I not been super pregnant and had the energy I would have taken my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love panda, but I went through the drive window with my wife, we thought wow that was quick we got home to horrible food I ordered steak and I had one piece of steak with all vegetables, my wife hardly had any beef, the next day I went in to tell the manager about the service he laughed and said yeah we get in a rush some times, horrible management I will eat panda in other location never here as long as this management is in place."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and tasty! Restaurant /seemed/ clean; I got mine to go so I can't say exactly.   However on a busy Saturday night there was only one person serving food AND she had to ring everyone up. They seemed way understaffed and I felt bad for the lady running around.   I got orange chicken and the honey walnut shrimp which is very good. Rice was nice and not too hard.   Overall I would have rated this location 4 stars but as I was finishing my last bite of shrimp I found a long thick brown hair in my mouth (I've got short blonde hair so...).   I don't think I'll be coming back to this location. I don't want to risk eating someone else's hair again."}
{"text":"Whichever girl worked drive thru on 5.13.15 at 8:45 pm is very rude if your un-happy with your job don't take it out on People who are giving you work in the first place. Get some education on customer service."}
{"text":"You know... if this restaurant was in a place where there were very few choices or to put it nicely in a not-so-diverse demographic area then I'd get it.  It's one of the reasons I think that PF Changs simply failed in TO.    I don't see how you can actually try to charge what you charge and serve what you serve at the price point you're trying to sell it at and exist long enough to make an impression on the public that you're trying to sell to.  What do I mean?  I had come here because one of my uncles just wanted to have a quick lunch and while I'm never, ever going to say no to what is referred to or understood to be as \"Chinese food\" I have to say this place made me feel like I was in a place, somewhere in the US mall or at a smaller food court where the other choices could have only been Burger King, KFC or Arby's.  What I mean is that this experience seemed food court-ish even though the place looked nice.  Your choices are simply 1 side and whether you want one, two or three  dishes.  They are priced differently of course and some of the items cost more (1.50 extra as a \"premium\") item.  I guess the upcharge is mildly offensive considering I chose fried rice and 2 \"non-premium\" mains (orange chicken and some similar looking beef thing - both with no veggies) with a bottled water and it was over 13 bucks with tax.    For 13 dollars I can seriously feed a family at Dixie Park at their food court there and that place is full blown Asian, not the North American version of Chinese food.  Closer to home for under 10 bucks I can get a take out container enough for me (did you know I can eat a lot?) to have TWO meals out of, dinner and lunch the next day which includes sweet and sour chicken (not balls, actual meat, beef and veggies and fried rice).  But this is Panda Express though... it's the Americanized version of Chinese food at a corner where the other choices are McDonald's, Mr. Greek Express, and Popeye's.  Heartland, remember?  Now while I'm not a native to Mississauga I know it well enough that a ten minute drive from Heartland I can get better Cantonese, Sichuan, Hakka-ish etc for what can only be described as a better overall value.  So to sum it up - it's not that Panda Express' food is not good.  It's decent but certainly not outstanding but the overall value and price point will leave you wondering why you'd come here when you can really have a better sit down non-food court cafeteria experience for either less or the same money and probably receive better portions all within a reasonable distance from Panda Express.  Again, not at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere that doesn't have choices... Choose wisely."}
{"text":"16 customers in line the managers washing windows on the front doors, another young lady stocking the drink station, young gentlemen mopping the kitchen floor only one counter person working the counter and also working the register, extremely poor service as usual here. I know why he was calling in the windows I guess the owner district manager is coming into Mr. Lee I made mention to Mr. Lee about the poor service and all he did was smile Vegas sorry for the wait."}
{"text":"I normally do not complain, but the food today at this location was awful....I ordered double mushroom chicken & fried rice ... I got three little pieces of chicken & the rice was hard (not cooked long enough)...I don't get to eat out often & was super disappointed.  Not sure I want to return to this location ."}
{"text":"Look knowing it's fast Chinese takeout, this is not going to be P.F. Chang's. But they literally closed the drive through at 8:40 pm today with closing time listed 9:30. Ducking out of work early anyone? Garbage establishments"}
{"text":"You know, not sure why this place gets a few bad reviews. I've been there a zillion times. Once....one time I waited BUT it was for fresh stuff. The people who work there are super nice....like nicer than at my own work so I really like that. Food is on par with all the other PA's I've been to around the country. I don't give it 5 just because it's really great but gotta reserve the 5 for exceptional. I think this place deserves a 4.5 though. I'll come here all day long. Waaaay better, more consistent than other similar places. Def recommend. Just go there. You know you crave their orange chicken. Don't lie to yourself. :)"}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru. Service was friendly and we could clearly hear over the intercom. We received the order promptly and it was hot. They included plenty of hot mustard and soy sauce as requested. The food was typical although the shrimp seemed to taste \"fishier\" than normal. No complaints but nothing I'll rush back for."}
{"text":"Whenever I don't want to cook and Boyfriend doesn't want a burger or Mexican food, we end up at Panda. Not my favorite thing in the world, but it's a break from cooking!  The store is very clean and the staff is very friendly.   But the real reason this location gets 4 stars is because they're one of the very few locations that still makes my favorite: Eggplant Tofu. While they don't always have it cooked and ready to go, they make it for me when I ask and I love them for it!  So, if you're an eggplant tofu lover and are watching it disappear from Pandas with dismay, head over to this location and ask for it!"}
{"text":"Basic Chinese food, good enough for lunch. Always hot food. Good service. Clean dining room. Parking leaves a little bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Went in at 4:40 this afternoon ,about 4 bowls had about a cup and a half in them.  I asked how old the green beans were.  She said not very but if I wanted to wait about 10 min.  stuff would be fresh.  I told her we didn't want to and ordered other things.  The chow mien was dry and old.  The stuff we got was also.  I told them I have never seen the food look like this  before.  Never offered a free egg roll or anything.  It looked like all new people in there. I will be calling corporate and won't be going back . They lost 2 customers.   If I could give less than 1 star I would."}
{"text":"Drive thru wait is always  ridiculous...Friday night at 930 and not so busy but the wait was a little insane."}
{"text":"I came by 20 minutes after they closed and as walked away, they came out to say they'd serve me. Granted, I was alone, but nonetheless I appreciated that kind of service."}
{"text":"So my wife gets out of work late and decides to stop at this location, she goes through the drive thru and when she gets home, behold it's nothing of what she ordered and the food taste bland. This is the second time this location does this. This used to be my favorite place to go eat but here lately they have just slacked off like if they were doing me a favor, news flash Panda Express I was doing you a favor but now I know I was just waiting my money here because there is no strike 3, in my book strike 2 and your out. Never again will I waist my money at this Panda Express location."}
{"text":"Adding one star.  I still really don't like Chinese-American food, but went for take out last week cause my wife and daughter wanted orange chicken.  This time, we got adequate amounts in our servings, including the fried rice and veggies.  And also this time, the  food was fresh and one of the dishes, the special angus beef, was made to order.  Prices still on the high side, IMO, but it was OK.  For people who like Chinese-American food, this place is pretty good I guess."}
{"text":"They will sell you rancid food!  I don't know what is with this place but the food tends to make me sick and I have heard the same from others about locations everywhere.  Are the using spoiled meat or something.  The only good thing I can tell you is they have sirracha sauce in little packets.  I did have some Walnut Shrimp that didn't make me sick, but I am now scared to try it again.......!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was cheese rangoon's. The staff was rude and wouldn't complete my order but would continue to pass it off to another staff member and finally I gave up on my cheese ragoons. It was very dirty as around the dinning area."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I have ever had at a panda ever. When I pulled up there was a ladder open and up in the entry to the drive through blocking it off. I went in and there was a line of about 6 people ahead if me and 2 girls working. One putting together plates and one working the register. When I got up to order they were out of 3-4 items with no hope of refilling them. As I was telling the girl what I wanted she started putting the wrong food into the tray and had to be corrected. After my order was correct I went to pay and instead of my food being out in a panda express bag it was put into a clear plastic TRASH BAG! Also almost all of the soda choices were out of syrup and were super nasty. I would recommend anyone go to this panda ever. Management clearly doesn't care about standards."}
{"text":"It's Panda Express.  Just what you'd expect.  Minus one star for running out of teriyaki chicken on multiple visits.  Four stars for being consistently friendly while I expressed my frustration about the chicken.  If you go between 5-7:30PM expect to wait in line."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this Panda Express. I was very disappointed. They ran out of the teriyaki chicken and it took a long time to make more. I guess it's understandable for something like this to happen once in a while. Not only were they late with the food, they also left out several items in my carry out order. First was the two extra plates I requested. They also failed to include the items I'm accustomed to see in my bag at their other locations. Those items they missed today were forks, napkins, say sauce and fortune cookies. My low rating of this place, however, is mostly due to their chosen reaction to failing a customer. The cashier, I think her name is something like Maribella or Maricella, didn't even apologize.  It would behoove the manager of this place to teach their staff better customer service skills. Sure, they might fail to meet the customer's needs from time to time. In those cases a sincere \"I'm sorry\" or maybe a free egg roll can go a long way to appease an unsatisfied customer and could dissuade him from taking the time to write a negative review."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda Express I have ever been to, they are always out of food place it's always dirty, very very very slow service and it doesn't seem like they are in a hurry to help their customers, they really deserve zero stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was standing there looking at what they had and the girl working says \"do you know what you're getting we have other people in line waiting\" but in an unnecessarily mean rude tone. He gets his order and then she picks up her personal cell phone to finish a conversation while ignoring the customers that were behind my boyfriend in line. Really? What was the rush for my boyfriend when you're going to ignore everyone behind? Makes sense. We will go to a different location that knows how to treat new customers (if at all) from now on."}
{"text":"This is your standard airport/mall pre-prepared Chinese place. It's not over priced, per se but it's small portions for what you pay - $6.10 for a bowl which is three scoops of rice and one scoop of entree.   I'm a big fan of strip mall Chinese places run by Chinese families. Same price but get a full plate that is over flowing, cooked fresh and usually a lunch special comes with either an egg roll or cup of soup - a much better value, especially for a freshly prepared meal.   My advice, if you are in a super hurry and crave Chinese, Panda Express may be for you. Otherwise, hit the local mom & pop place."}
{"text":"My beef with broccoli had 3 small pieces of beef and 8 giant pieces broccoli. The fried rice was still hard...undercooked.  It's good for quick Chinese food that is slightly better than most of the Chinese take outs around town.  Rice garden in Bashas is better."}
{"text":"I eat here often..... The food is always fresh and it's close to my house.... Getting a little pricey but still worth it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they are out of string bean chicken breast almost every time I go. Not out like they'll make more, but each time Im told, we don't have that today. How can this location constantly not have a menu item? I have to assume that management isn't able to place food orders accurately to keep up with demand. But regardless, this location is by far THE WORST I've ever been to. I called and left a message for the area manager today and also emailed corporate. The store manager at the very least needs some SERIOUS retraining if not termination. Running out of food is rule one    for food service....."}
{"text":"This is a Panda Express, nothing too out of the ordinary. You get food for a relatively good price, you get the quality that you buy for. Like how fast service is, for the taste that is given back. Nothing more to such."}
{"text":"Could be SO MUCH BETTER! Paying ATTENTION I ordered 3 bowls 2 with orange chicken 1 with pepper chicken and 1 plate  I usually check but I didn't because THEY HAVE (NOT MADE ANY MISTAKES) In awhile  What I got was 3 ORANGE CHICKEN and asked for 2 teriyaki sauce! I asked the worker you put in 2 sauces yes she was yes they are both inside the bag  Well they were not!! I don't care for orange chicken but didn't want to go back!!"}
{"text":"I come to this location regularly, and notice it can be slow, but I will absolutely not be going anymore. It can be busy but tonight around 6:30 I came in and waited for a good 10 minutes until I was in front. Then waited another 10 while another gentleman and I were completely ignored and not served. While one employee got his food and took a break, another looking like she was messing with a computer, the third employee came out of the back, meticulously cleaned a cutting board, and a couple others that went back and forth to the back. At this time there was probably 10 people in line. We were not served until a cook in the back told somebody to help us. Only to get home and realize that my order was wrong and soy sauce was forgotten. Would not recommend unless you have a lot of time on your hands and enjoy unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any location of Panda Express.  Time of visit - 8:00PM. I gave one star because the customer service was Good.  The food - not so much.  Totally overcooked, hard, tough meat.  The chow mien was rubbery and pieces so small that the use of chop sticks or a fork was an exercise in futility - had to use a spoon.  Everything had what I can only describe as a slightly  \"off\" taste - almost like it had absorbed the odors of spoiled food in a cooler.   Sorry Panda Express, but I will not be patronizing this location again."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"bigger plate\" which include three entree and one side order for roughly $10. The entrees is too spicy and or too salty. Staff are nice but not looking forward to early signs of high blood pressure."}
{"text":"Was here once before and the food was very good.  Today Sunday at 4:45pm and they are out of several things.  No orange chicken.  15 minutes before that would be ready.  No beef available for the rest of the day.  Low on most other items it appeared.  Ended up leaving as did the people in front of us.   It seems like as long as you come earlier in the day the food is available."}
{"text":"I like Panda Express once in a while, but this location... Oh my it is disgusting. A few bites and I almost got sick. It is far from the Panda Express were used to, not that PE is considered top Chinese food but even in PE standards this is the most disgusting thing I put in my mouth.  Wish I had the audacity to ask for my money back."}
{"text":"There are a ton of pandas in Vegas! We chose this one because it was on the way to the Las Vegas LDS Temple which we were visiting for family night. There was hardly any line and we got our food quickly. The seating was about 1/3 full. We were satisfied with our food. Good ol' Orange Chicken. One of my favorite foods. I wish they had knives though... do any pandas have knives?"}
{"text":"Like so many national food chains, Panda Express is pretty much the same all over.  That said, either you like them or do not.  Here in Scottsdale, we have many alternatives to Panda Express.    You have The Red Door, Ling and Louie, PF Chang's, Jade Palace, Pei Wei (similar in many ways to Panda Express), George & Sons, to name just a few; or even Flo's which is across the street from this location.  So, the choices are pretty much endless.  The key, I believe in seeking out Panda Express is convenience and time.  Sit down restaurants involve time.  Both in travel, but also ordering and waiting for the food to be prepared and served. Yes, I know most of these restaurants have takeout.  What Chinese restaurant doesn't have takeout?  But here, you come in, point at a few items behind the glass, pay and you're on your way. -- and their prices are very reasonable.  If you have a limited lunch hour, or in reality a half hour, then Panda Express becomes a very reasonable alternative for those of us who eat at our desks.    In the end, the food is universally good -- not NYC Chinatown Five stars good, but fast food Chinese Three Stars, \"A-Okay\" good.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I go here because it is convenient and I leave here thinking I should have went somewhere else. My walnut shrimp tasted like they had been \"re-cooked\" and fell apart. My beef tasted like it had been sitting in the pan for a very very long time. The cream cheese wontons were very old and dry.  The only highlight was the kung pao chicken. Lots of chicken and squash. It was delicious. I wish I would have gotten more of it instead of the above.   I always get the 1/2 1/2 with the fried rice and chow mein. It was ok.  Service was fast. But, I don't want to return here and will resist the urge for a long time."}
{"text":"So this was our first visit to any panda express, ordered online through yelp found the order site relatively easy to navigate. Upon arriving at the store/restaurant went in the front door and headed to the online pick up area. I arrive roughly 3 minutes prior to the ready time provided to me at order placement. Due to the large crowd the eggrolls were not ready, but only took a few extra minutes. Staff was extremely helpful and very kind and apologized up-and-down for any kind of additional wait. Overall I would say for timing online ordering and ease-of-use, we would go back. The best part about panda express is the ability to try different dishes all within a meal plan. $22 gave my wife and I and two kids a perfect meal. Just my two cents thank you"}
{"text":"Over 30 minutes spent in the drive-thru! THIRTY MINUTES! I get it, things run out & need to be made, that stuff takes time but a simple \"I'm sorry for the wait\" would have made up for it but the employee didn't say anything but the total when I pulled up. When I asked \"Do you have hot mustard?\" He said \"okay\" shut the window and walked away. This isn't the first time it's happened. Common courtesy from the employee would have more than made up for the long wait."}
{"text":"I am writing this in hopes the owner or corporate will see it because this is one of the poorest quality panda I have been to. I love panda and have eaten at lots of their restaurants. This one is right by my house and is AWFUL. The chow mean is old, Luke warm, and dry. The chicken is always chewy and poorly prepared. I've never had these issues at other panda restaurants. They need a quality check."}
{"text":"The Food is Great!  The workers are the best.  The place is at a great location, very safe location, right in front if the Harley dealership.  It recently though has started to go downhill a bit especially with the quality if food."}
{"text":"SCREW THIS LOCATION! I can't EVER get teriyaki chicken after 8:30. EVER. Tonight is the 3rd time this week!...and it's currently 8:56 and they said there will be none for the rest of the night. UNACCEPTABLE. The manager for this location needs to be fired. ALWAYS a horrible experience here. Tired of this BS! Never going back!"}
{"text":"I don't even know if it's worth one star this was horrible it didn't even look like the correct portions it was just thrown into the Styrofoam container and most of the food was cold no more panda express too many bad experiences"}
{"text":"Food was good. But every time I've came here there's been an issue with my food. I went inside and the person in the black shirt somehow seemed to get my order wrong standing right in front of me . He seemed hurried and didn't pay attention when I said something . He was rude and messing people's orders and just seemed to be moving them along . I live nearby and visit Panda Express a few times per week. But because of this man, I will never return to this one ."}
{"text":"Don't EVER order online and go to pick it up. This is the worst place ever. I watched 15 people come and go and nobody waited on me. This also happened to a coworker at the same place. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT AND HORRIBLE EMPLOYEES AT THIS LOCATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been to this location many many times. Food trays only have little bits of dried up food in them and they always try and serve it to you and if you ask for fresh you get a crazy look from the servers and then they tell you it will be 10 minutes. Always long lines so why can't they keep fresh food up."}
{"text":"YES!! This is SO yummy!!   I love going in and getting samples!! ;)"}
{"text":"So it's finally moving day and of course it's total chaos! It's already 9PM and we haven't had a meal yet, I realize I'm in a brand new world and we weren't trying to go exploring on our first night!   Panda Express is literally down the street from our new house and it was open late! We came inside to place our order and their was multiple flaws when trying to order!  -Tried to order a kids meal they started plating up an adult portion (Told them 2x and they finally got it right)  -They didn't understand us at all, not sure if it was a language barrier but our order was botched  -Ordered rangoons and egg rolls employee asks if we want sweet and sour sauce with it which we do (never got the sauce)  -Mom tries ordering something a la carte and they didn't give it to us :/  My Orange chicken was OK, I've had it fresher but then again it was 9PM :/ 3AM hits and I become extremely ILL! We all know what the feeling of food poisoning is like. It hits you hard and like a ton of bricks.   So I'm not sure if I could return and give them another try, if I do it will be a LONG time before that happens!  Moral of the story: Double check your order and your bag to make sure you get what you ordered!  -___-"}
{"text":"Food is 5 out of 5 stars. Cleanliness was also great. However, the staff deserves negative stars. Ghetto, rude and trashy with zero manners and terrible customer service. This wasn't an issue of them being untrained or just new, these are people that cannot care less about their job. Hire people that actually want to work!"}
{"text":"Came to eat here on sunday. This was the worst panda location! It took 15 min for them to begin to take my order. We were in the drive thru! They said they were having problems with the grill so the selection was limited. We ordered the cream cheese bites and never got them. My daughters chicken was burnt. Black- charcoal burnt. Employees need to be retrained. We will never recommend this location to anyone! All of our food tasted burnt and just nasty! $50 down the drain."}
{"text":"Wish you could give negative stars... absolutely disgusting... to start off no lo mein noodles at 12noon... really.  So I wait 10 minutes and still none even though she said theyd be right out, I finally said I'll just take a side of Beijing Beef which was $10 (REALLY!!!!) I go to eat the beef and it was basically inedible... it was hard as a rock and tasted extremely old.  Thought about complaining and getting my money back but, I guess I needed to reaffirm why I usually boycott this sh*thole (Company as a whole) but, I didnt have time to wait being I was on lunch. Shouldve paid card so I could charge back.  NEVER AGAIN !!!"}
{"text":"I sent my son in to pick up dinner and they charged us twice but claimed the charges never went through. My bank app showed 2 separate transactions. I called and spoke to 3 different people and had my son show the bank app showing that they charged us twice. Then they put someone named Daniel on the phone and he claimed that there was no way we got charged because a receipt didn't print. He was extremely rude and condescending. Even laughed at me on the phone and said that this wouldn't have happened if there was money on the card. Do not go to this Panda! I wish I would've read the previous YELP reviews regarding this location. They have several reviews regarding their horrible service there. They could've made this right but instead they chose to humiliate my son and demean me over the phone. Totally unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I keep going back to this location is because I am close. Every time I go in this location there is little to no food made, or what's out looks like it's been out for hours. The food when fresh is good, but it's never fresh unless you wait for them to make new. Today I went in at 4:30 and there was a manager lady hiding behind phone,  one new cook, and one employee going so slow two people behind me left. After I asked to have food made, I went to pay and the kid said we are only accepting cash right now so I just left. A few minutes later I decided to call and ask when the credit card machine was going to be up and running and manager said it is working. I said well your employee seems to think different and she asked me to come back and she would take care of it. Well I didn't go back but now I wonder if the kid is just pocketing cash and saying the credit card machine is down. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I EVER  GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Yuck yuck yuck this is not chinese food.  Why waste you're time here when your just 1 block away from china town."}
{"text":"This was the most helpful and awesome experience. We ordered over the phone and the team was incredibly helpful and quick. A lot of these reviews on here are not representative of the service we received today during the lunch rush. They were accommodating, polite, and friendly. We do not know the names of those who helped us but I did hear a team member Katie asking customers questions about their New Years and being very caring and kind. Everyone was awesome! Thank you all so much!"}
{"text":"I love Panda Express their food is so good and they are always coming up wit something new! My favorite food is the sweet fire chicken! Try it next time you're in! One thing though i always seem to get sick after eating here, I don't know if it's the grease or what but I wish they could cut it down a little"}
{"text":"Food is good enough.   No better or worse than any other location.   The service, though,  is HORRIBLE!!!  So bad that you have to wonder if they are being forced against their will to work there.   Rude and unhelpful."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or time here. Mediocre bland food. Poor selection. Plenty of things on the menu but very few actually available to order without a 15 min wait. Anything that looks remotely nice is classified \"premium\" and costs $1.50 extra. Not going back there."}
{"text":"Listen, Panda Express is about a good a $10 take home meal as I can ask for, however....when you advertise that you are open until 10pm, ESPECIALLY in this part of town where their aren't a whole lot of options, you can't be all cleaned up and empty of food at 8:45pm..I have worked in many restaurants and I personally would NEVER go into a place 10-15 minutes before they close, I understand employees like to leave when shop is closed and I don't blame them one bit...but to have everything shut down 75 MINUTES before closing?!   All I can say is thank goodness for Fausto's 2 doors down..they get my money instead."}
{"text":"The food is consistently cold. My wife and I went, and they didn't have String Bean Chicken because they were out of sauce. It was 11AM. She orders that dish every time, and it's never been out anywhere else.   She returned her cold food for a refund; they didn't apologize or offer anything else. I just dealt with my cold food.   We go to Panda Express' often, but this location just doesn't have the attention to detail."}
{"text":"Update directly messaged  Derek back from panda . 3 days later no phone call no nothing. It has actually been 2 weeks since my prob at panda and no answers."}
{"text":"Hopefully this help new comers. You order by selecting either lomein noodle or fried rice. Then choose either 2 or 3 sides. Typical chinese express. We ordered half lomein half frice rice + 2 sides + apple juice for $12. Pretty cheap in vegas strip standard. However the food does taste cheap as well."}
{"text":"I'm assuming everyone knows what a Panda Express is so I don't need to go in much on he food.  It was warm and tasted fine so no issues there.  Stopped in here for lunch and it was very quick and easy.  The girl working the counter was very nice and worked quickly with us.  As far as cleanliness goes, this looked very clean.  I've been to a lot of fast-food restaurants that have nooks and crannies that are absolutely disgusting but this place did not have any noticeable ones."}
{"text":"Apparently they got yelled at because of their previous slow times. Dont get me wrong it was quick fast and easy... Also very uncomfortable. The lady at the front was crazy rude. I get that they are trying to move fast but I dont appreciate being treated lile herded cattle. The lady infront of me was asked what will you have? She replied chicken. Before she was able to say what kind of chicken the extremely rude lady said \"what kind of chicken? I have several kinds of chicken\" rudely and mean. You could tell she was trying to hurry her up. Except I was the last person and I wouldn't have minded waiting a few minutes so that lady wasn't harrassed that way. Wth panda? Never coming to this location again. Idk what happened I used to love this location last year."}
{"text":"This has to be simply the WORST location I have ever patronized. The string beans were dried up, the sweet fire chicken was stale and hard, the chow mein lacked noodles. To make it an additionally horrible experience, no e of the staff were present. We banged on the counter and shouted out. Only the soda was good!  Overall grade=D- -"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this location one star, if it were an option. Panda used to be my favorite and this one is right around the corner from where I work, that may be why I've given it so many chances.   Going as far back as I can remember, consecutively each experience has been negative.   1- coworker and I arrive a few minutes after 11, it was still closed. It was past 11 and the hours posted on their dor indicated they'd be open by then. Outside there was an employee sitting at a table, we asked if she knew when they may be opening. She said she didn't know.   2- arrived around 11 and there were only a few others inside. They took my order and my payment then said to wait for the chow mein. I went over my 30 minute lunch break because after finally having the chow mein available, the lady serving filled orders for customers who had just walked in rather than prioritizing myself and the few others that had already waited for over 20 minutes.  3- Went through the drive thru and ordered a bowl with chow mein and walnut shrimp. Got back to work and the bowl wasn't even filled up half way! The bowl is not very big to begin with and they didn't even fill it up. It was a waste of $7!  4- went through the drive thru again. I ordered a plate with chow mein, orange chicken and mushroom chicken. I got back to work and saw that they gave me some spicy dish instead of the mushroom chicken I asked for, even though it also said mushroom chicken on the receipt.   5- Ordered chow mein and got back to work and saw the noodles didn't have any sauce(?!) it was like the noddles were cooked to soften then served as is.  I don't even know why I bothered giving it so many go's after always having something wrong about my order or negative about the experience. But no more, done with them and I hope they shut down because they don't deserve to be making profit from terrible service."}
{"text":"I am so sick of this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend likes it but there is hardly any chicken in the dish with zucchini and mushrooms. The orange chicken is hard as a rock plus the noodles and rice suck!! The only decent thing is the crag ragoons. NO MORE!!"}
{"text":"I hope this sums it up: I just downloaded the yelp app for the first time for the sole purpose of giving this place 1 star. Slow, rude, out of everything at a non-peak time."}
{"text":"We did take out here last week.   Its not awful, but its definitely not the best food in the world.  My boyfriend's mom came back to their house with orange chicken, terryaki chicken, garlic chicken, fried rice, lo mein, and egg rolls. There might have been more, but those are the things I sampled.   The only thing I didn't like was the eggroll. It left a weird onion-y aftertaste in my mouth and I haaated onions.   I don't know much about dining here, but to-go, it was fine. If I were in the area, I'd rather stop in to Tomo which is right next door."}
{"text":"A-OK... for a place that has people who are very clearly not asian speaking with an asian accent.  That was kind of weird actually.    But no issues with service or anything and it's clean."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. I went inside and stood in line for 10 minutes watching the staff just screw around in the kitchen every 30 seconds looking over at me right in the eyes while they weren't doing anything. It was very frustrating as a customer, I walked out and I'll never walk back into this place again."}
{"text":"The employees here are always a joy! There are 3 Panda Expresses relatively equidistant from our house, but we always go to this one. It's bigger, always clean, the employees (who know us by now) are always incredibly nice, and keep cool under the pressure of long lines. Food is always hot, and if you want to wait for the fresher batch anyway, they never let it show if it annoys them. :D"}
{"text":"The shop is really nice and clean but it seems like they never have food prepared. I ordered half chow mein half rice, with spring rolls and chicken. Many of the options were empty or less than half way full. I was told that there was no chow mein or spring rolls but i was okay with waiting. The staff was very friendly offering drinks to everyone who was waiting for an item not yet prepared. (About 4 other people) i waited about 10 minutes when someone brought me my food bagged up. Got home and there is no chow mein in here. Pretty annoying especially since i waited around for it. :/ at least they remembered the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Love the orange chicken. This place is great for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap and quick bite to eat, Panda Express is great.   For around $7 you can get a 2 entree meal. If you and a friend aren't too hungry, 2 people could easily split this meal.   Their Large drink is more like an Extra Large. So if you aren't too thirsty, just get the Medium (which is like a large). You can save a little there.   You may already have your mind set on Beef and Broccoli (For Example). However, who knows how long the food has been sitting there?  If you want something more fresh, before standing in line to order, take a look at some of the dishes. This way, you can spot what looks good and what looks like it should have been thrown away days ago."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The establishment was clean and well kept.  The food was good as always. I got great portion sizes. Everything was in stalk... no food items missing. Effy (the employee who took care of me) was extremely nice and attentive.  I'll be back soon lol."}
{"text":"Best panda express around! Everything is clean, fresh, and not oilly or too salty.  Also, the people that work here are friendly, and efficient.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Employees: A+++++++++++++++++++   Food A++  If I could give them 10 stars, I would.  Every single employee always smiles and is very friendly.  The food is always fresh.  This is my favorite panda and it is close to where I work.  We come here often for take out  and I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I was out running errands with my kids and started to get hungry so my daughter wanted Panda Express. My son was asleep in the car but I knew some Panda's had drive thru's so I searched the closest one to me to call and find out if they did. I spoke with Phillipe and ask him if they had one. He said no sorry, so I asked if he knew where one was close by because my son fell asleep in the car. This kind hearted man told me to not worry about it, to order on the phone and he would bring it out to my car when I arrivied! I was so shocked on how thoughful he was to do that because he honestly did not have to. I just want to thank Phillipe for his outstanding service and thought he should be recognized for being such a great person/employee. :)"}
{"text":"Rude staff and charge more money for same product cold orange chicken unsteamed crunchy white rice wow place went down hill quick on par for Maryville area"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with this panda. I came very late night (almost 9pm). I am used to seeing the last of the trays at this point but not in this panda. Everything looked fresh, even the vegetables. Not hut that but they had all the choices out and fresh. I didn't have to wait for my food like I am used to in other pandas. I did ask for fresh vegetables and she da tell me that they were pretty fresh but that she could have some more made of I wished. I said no because they did look crispy still. I am leaving a review, not really for the food but for the staff and how friendly they are. If I go back I will Make sure the two girl's names and thank them. Keep it up panda! This location has gained my hope for this chain once again."}
{"text":"Panda is delicious. One of my favorite places to eat as a vegetarian. You can ask for their tofu option of the menu. I wish that they worked on marketing more organic non-GMO tofu for an Eco-friendly alternative to all the processed foods. Either way it is a great treat! The staff is always working hard and always nice whenever I go in to their establishment."}
{"text":"Panda is always a solid choice for a quick lunch. Today I joined a couple colleagues and had a two item combo with half steamed rice half fried rice, sweet fire chicken breast and the spicy shrimp chefs special. I sampled the honey walnut shrimp but was intrigued by the chefs special. The sweet fire chicken breast was delicious and fresh 4/5, the spicy shrimp was very good 4/5.  Service was good as it is behind the counter, and the tables were clean and many open for choice of seating. Will be back again for another quick panda meal soon."}
{"text":"Overall Service was good food was hot and good the only thing that I notice that was not quite right was the knife that they used to cut up the beef was very dirty with old the beef juices on the knife laying in the bowel where the beef is. Also the Cutting Board that they use to cut the beef on look like it had not been cleaned for a very long time my suggestion is don't eat it, wish I couls rember the name of the dish. The other thing that kind of bugged me was the lady that helped us I told that we had two other people with us and she just walked off! Later during our visit they took over one of the tables and started doing their paperwork don't they have an office in the back I all I guess that's it"}
{"text":"I walked in saw about 15 people in line and knowing how slow this place is I turmed around an left and went to mcdonald's  This place worries more about window orders than the people in line"}
{"text":"Food was good I had orange chicken I wish they would have some extra sauce so they could put it over the rice but they don't also I wish they would just have spoons with their Forks I do have one complaint and I seen this and most Panda restaurants is there a cutting board that they used to cut up meat along with the knife are never clean between uses and one other complaint I just had a Fortune cookie without a fortune in it"}
{"text":"Cheap Hot and Fast!!! If you are in a rush and need to have a quick fill up this is the place to be. Yummy chinese food in generous portions. Can't go wrong here. Free taste too."}
{"text":"nov 21, 2017. very disappointing and disgusting..The rice was mushy over cooked just like the chicken also  tasteless the rice could've been salted while it was cooking .. Then we were overcharged for something we didn't even order"}
{"text":"Both me and my 3 year old son got food poisoning from eating here the other night. Definitely ruined Panda Express for me"}
{"text":"This Panda Express is near the Harkins Cine' Capri movie theater and is usually less busy than some other locations.   We have been coming here for several years since we moved to the Valley and the food and service has always been good. On problem for us Yelpers is the sometimes inability to check-in because of bad cell signal availability.   So, come and enjoy the food and check-in as you are leaving the parking lot as we have done in the past.  At least the map location is correct!"}
{"text":"I don't think the guy working at the register and cook knew that they were at work. Between the eye rolls and  attitude you would think that they were at home getting yelled at by their family's to clean their room. An hour before closing you shouldn't have two dishes out and trying to guilt people into not asking for what they want."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but this Panda is getting a little ridiculous. The last two times we have came to this location our order has been wrong or items forgotten. This time I ordered three of the exact same plates and a kids meal, one order of egg rolls and 2 orders of ragoons; I was asked to pull to the side while I am assuming food was being cooked. The girl brings us our order I asked her if EVERYTHING was there she said yes, my stupid self took her word since I had to wait for it. We get home and one of the orders was missing ALL the orange chicken and had three tiny pieces of Teriyaki chicken and was missing and order of crab ragoons. How do you pull is up and STILL forget to fill the box?? Look at my reciept and she only charged me for one order of the ragoons, okay what ever we will eat the three we have. But who wants to only eat chow mein and fried rice. Self lesson no matter what ALWAYS CHECK EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"The food has always been good and the service just keeps getting better.  They recently remodeled the building, so it's very modern/clean looking.  They always give you a heaping mound of each dish, so you never feel you're not getting your money's worth.  There's an extra $0.50 or $1.00 for some of the more premium items (shrimp, added bacon, etc) but it's always worth it.  I wouldn't want to eat there every day, but I'm always happy when I get the chance."}
{"text":"This experience was pretty awful. I got here and firstly there were four children running around with food and crawling on the floor while their mothers sat and texted. I was pretty disgusted as I walked in but gave it a shot anyways. I ordered what I always order, fried rice, orange chicken and cream cheese rangoons. My fried rice was average, can't mess that up really. My orange chicken was dry as all get out, just awful. Then to top it off they burnt my favorite part, the cream cheese rangoon, it was too crunchy to chew, flavorless and dry. Terrible experience by far the worst I've had here. Not coming back to this one if any. Expect more out of your experience than just average. I know it's not fine dining but it should be edible and a relatively mellow environment."}
{"text":"For two people, dinner and drinks for under $20.00 is still a bargin.  The place is very clean and friendly.  My only complaint is I wish the food was hotter.  Great food selection, no soups are available.  We enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"I love panda express but this place was just wow!! The customer service was awful. I asked to try the orange chicken to make sure it was good for my 3year old to eat and the had the audacity to tell me well you can order the  try it . Ummmm no , then i get to the window and she says\" next time come inside\" super rude !"}
{"text":"so NONE of our entrees or sides were available or cooked so we have to wait AFTER we ordered for our food. this place is supposed to be \"fast food\" and get it as you go so why am i waiting 20+ minutes after? ridiculous. ALSO theres people on break at 6 pm at dinner rush? how does that make sense when they obviously need all the help they can get..."}
{"text":"slooooooow as a turtle. under staffed and there were customers that came after us and they got their food before us. i only ordered food for two people. i had to go up to them and mention it to them because it took so long. waited 10 min in line and 10 min after we already paid. also the drive thru line was super long.. very very slow smh. just got home and checked.. THE EGG ROLLS I ORDERED ARENT THERE!!!!! what the heck"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this Panda. I always enjoy their food, but had a couple of minor issues at this location. The first was the portion was smaller than average, and it left me hungry. Normally I'm stuffed after I eat at Panda, but this one left me a bit hungry. Also, they didn't have any hot and sour soup, which is a favorite of mine. Lastly, the food court was a bit dirty, and the trash can was overflowing. Id go back because it's the cheapest place around and the food is always enjoyable, but this panda is worse than most others."}
{"text":"The restaurant was good the day they started but lately the chicken wasn't good they don't remove the fat like they used to do."}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express. The manager was super rude and refused to return my order so I could pay with another card. She said it would make her look bad. Her behavior did that for her. On top of everything they forgot half my order. Don't go to this one if you can help it."}
{"text":"Customer service is hit and miss (mostly miss). The quality of food is usually good except after 8pm. It's like the employees just don't care anymore. I try to avoid coming here too late because they're trying to clean up and shutdown and I know I won't get anything good as far as service or food. I have proven this over multiple disappointing visits. I ordered the Shanghai Angus steak which is a premium item with a premium charge and they made it using regular beef instead of steak. Everytime i come here they just let me down. Save your money and go to another location because this location won't get any better."}
{"text":"It is Panda Express, so the expectation bar should not be set too high.  Takeout Chinese in a fast food environment is not fine dining, but it serves a purpose - something other than a burger, quickly.    With the light at Seneca and South Blvd, this location is relatively easy to get in and out of regardless of which way you are traveling on South Blvd.  Parking is plentiful even at the busy lunch hour and easy.  At the Panda, when I am tired of burgers and running for the border, I usually choose the two entree takeout.  With this you get your choice of fried rice or chow mein (they call it chow mein, it's noodles with some green veggie and I think onion, I honestly haven't paid much attention to it), or I get 1/2 of each.  I have tried the Sweet Fire Chicken and it is a fried chicken in a sweet spicy sauce.  And I think what I had most recently was Beijing Beef, which is a fried beef in a spicy dark sauce.    By no means is this the best Chinese food that I have ever had, but every time I have been, the employees have been friendly and the restaurant is clean.  It is exactly what you would think Chinese fast food take out to be, and sometimes that is all you need."}
{"text":"Ordered my food online and they put teraki sauce over EVERYTHING. I didn't request any teraki sauce.  Just 2 sides of sweet and sour. Who drowns rice and chow mein in nasty ass sauce. Never ordering online again"}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars I would. This has always been my husband and my Saturday Night Ritual, if you will, until about 6 to 8 months ago. & I will say we are guilty of going back because it is our closest location and it's more Convenient for us. But tonight was the last straw and it really wasn't that BIG of a deal, it's just all the little things adding up. Tonight my husband sat through about a ten minute line after work (not a huge deal, we understand they are busy.) He comes home to see that they completely forgot about his second entree. He ordered orange chicken & teriyaki and he only got a small amount of orange, no teriyaki at all. We were so frustrated because again Panda has let us down.   Here's a small list of things we've dealt with at this location in the past :   *forgetting our Ragoons constantly (over three time)   *finding literally a hard sharp plastic piece in my kung pow chicken (about the size of a pea)   *waiting in a line for literally 40 minutes and we messaged corporate that night because they completely gave us the wrong order  *our food spills all over in the bag EVERY time we get it.   *the gave us our \"plates\" in cardboard cups without explaining why and we didn't know what food they were giving us and the portions were all off, (I did get extra teriyaki that day because they messed up with portions)   * we've had to come back over 5 times just to fix their mistakes   *there portions are horrible, the never give you enough at all, my mushroom chicken usually only contains 2 pieces of chicken. Does that sound right? I don't think so ...  These are just a few things that are at the top of my head ...   I could go on for days. We love Panda but something needs to be done about this location. I never complain ... unless it's something really really important and as you can see by all the other reviews ... I am not wrong. This place needs fixed and we've lost so much money here. Just $7 today by not going and getting back our other entree.we shouldn't have to go back out because of there mistakes again ... we will never be at this location again. We'd rather go next door to McDonald ..."}
{"text":"I hate reviewing chain restaurants but sometimes I just have to.  This panda express had 3 employees working in the front & our first impression was not nice. The employee Bailey made it apparent that she did not want to be working there.  My mom asked her for a sample of one the entrees & she grabbed a tooth pick & before she even reached for one my mother asked for the small piece but Bailey grabbed a big one. & she angrily threw the food away & grabbed another toothpick & as she was about to grab another piece my mom reminded her of a small piece. She rolled her eyes, grabbed the the tray of food out of the buffet station & grab another piece & grudgingly gave the toothpick to my mother.   The next employee however, was more pleasant. Unfortunately, I didn't get her name :(  I was just sad that my kid's meals rice portion was not full and had empty space.  But overall, if it wasn't for that rude employee, I would honestly rate this place with 5 stars."}
{"text":"pandas are awesome! Express as in not waiting is better. 3 entrees plus a carb side for 10 bucks? Nice!  FOOD Angus steak option looked and tasted good! Otherwise it's panda! Authentic Chinese? No. Quick cheap and what you see is what you get? Yeah.  DECOR minus 4 stars for no real pandas...not. Cmon. Panda Express one star? You must eat lobster every day. I ate lobster twice last week but I'm still not a douche.  TIPS Orange chicken is just Asian chicken nuggets with ketchup.  Get a sample of shrimp. One is enough."}
{"text":"Came to this location fifteen minutes before closing expecting to be rushed along. Instead, Marife was so nice and helpful! Even at the end of what I'm sure was a long day she still had a smile and was very pleasant! She is definitely a person who belongs in customer service."}
{"text":"The decor is nice but that's about the only thing this panda express has going for them. The staff is neutral-unfriendly, far from superior customer service. I've come here appx four times since they opened and have had to wait for the side I wanted each time. This time, I get here at 11, when the store is supposed to open, its been 20 minutes, all the sides are not out, and the steamed rice and mixed veggies are not prepared. To be honest, I will probably still come here because its close and there aren't a lot of other restaraunts in walking distance, but I'm ashamed."}
{"text":"This chain has made a LOT of improvements over the past few years, where they fell into the over-saturated restaurant chain abyss. I mean sure it's not as good as your typical \"Mom and Pop's\" local Chinese place but hey, for a chain, it really HAS improved.   I'm basing this on the flavors and RELATIVE (key point) quality. IF you get the food fresh from the hot Woks, it's really pretty good. IF it's been sitting in the food warmer for hours....NOT so much.  And yes, the food does have lots of breading and it's not \"authentic\" Chinese by ANY stretch of the imagination! But is it tasty? Yup. A decent option? Yup again.  I'm not sure why this location got poor reviews.....I've only been in here a few times and each time the service was pleasant and quick....the food, again, pretty good FOR A CHAIN. So I give it 4 stars in a very relative context."}
{"text":"Now this is the way it is done. The food was hot, tasty and well presented. The service was excellent. The store is clean and well kept. The manager and crew know how to do it. Very much enjoyed my dinner.   I really like Panda Express but they are not all created equal. I travel a lot and have eaten at many all over the states and most are good. This one is excellent.  Now if we could get these people to make a trip to Dayton, Ohio to teach them how it is done. That one not so good."}
{"text":"Good options and decent for fast food chinese. I love how they list the nutrition facts as to order wisely. Many options for all tastes and everything looked fresh. It certainly isn't the best we have had as far as Asian fare, but in a pinch this is a contender on the fly. The portions are very generous for the price maing this also a good value."}
{"text":"It's Panda.  Got exactly what I expected. It isn't gourmet,  it isn't even cheap really.  Sometimes I ask myself why I stop here."}
{"text":"Food is consistent.  They updated which is nice.  Not happy that every table is dirty and so is the floor."}
{"text":"By far the slowest most unorganized panda I have ever been too. Lines out the door with no help at the counter. Employees seem confused on what's going on. Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Love the service. Great and friendly staff. Was nice to feel welcomed. They got me in and out. And even asked if I wanted a drink."}
{"text":"Great Place, it's always busy, but they always try to serve us as quick as possiable.  The team is very helpful and polite."}
{"text":"This place is criminally underrated. It's Chinese fast food, set your expectations correctly. However, they have some fantastic dishes. They are priced very fair, and great for on the go with their drive thru. Staff is very friendly and happy to let you sample as many different dishes as you like. The food is rotated regularly and never left to sit out all day. This is one of my regular stops every Sunday after attending Journey Church down the street. I wouldn't come here looking for PF Changs, but they definitely beat your average Chinese delivery place.  I have no clue what they ever did to deserve such a low rating. I have been coming here for months on a regular basis, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! The manager and employee had such crappy attitudes. Ordered using the Panda Express App and also had a Promo code. I had thought that my order went through but it somehow didn't. So when my husband and I showed up they had told us they had no orders under my name. But they didn't say it very nicely. They were quite rude making me feel like I was stupid. I highly recommend to NOT go here. What ever happened to keeping the customers happy? Guess they don't care one bit. In my opinion they don't even deserve a star. I wild give them a negative 5 stars if I could. But since I had to select a star they get 1"}
{"text":"When you say you close at 10 pm and we come here at 955 that does not mean you don't have any food for us. I come in at 9:55 wait till 10:01 in line there is just Orange chicken left and bottom of the rice I am told, this is all we have we are now closed! Really? You were open when I came in and I drove 10 min to get here before you close to get food. There is a reason all these places have bad reviews. I mean come on man if you open till 10 you open till 10 not 930 when wam start putting things away. And then give me attitude and say We are closed now it's 10:01 lol. Alright sounds good lost another Cutomer. I came here at 9:55 not 10:03 and if you closed tune of the sign and lock the door. Don't let me in let me wait in line for 7 min then say we are closed this is all you get!"}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service. They always offer samples.  The restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"I've been a panda costumer in Hawaii, and I can tell the difference..anyways, the staff  were nice...their place is clean but the table I sat on was a bit dirty ( forgot to wipe?) So here, I ordered 3 plate lunches. Noticed that their \"to go plate lunches are small\" I was looking for the eggplant with tofu and I asked the lady, she told me that they don't cook at that location ? Reallyyyyyyy???? Of all the Panda Express that I've been going, this is the only panda that don't cook that dish, what a lame...I was disappointed .. I guess I'll go to other location next time.. Plus their chow mein, omg! You're paying worth $7 something and your chow mein is only noddles and cabbage!! Another disappointment there:( Plus they don't give enough food. In Hawaii , they give you the big plate lunch and they even loaded you with food that you order..thought they'll give you more since the cost of living here is way lower than Hawaii. What a lame"}
{"text":"We went quickly through the drive thru with a simple order. Dominique was extremely rude. She kept correcting us that it was called a Panda bowl with chicken instead of a orange chicken bowl. No where on the menu is a panda bowl listed. I hope when we get home this order is correct."}
{"text":"Very fast & attentive service. All menu items fresh & hot. Samples offered. Ordered 2 different combos: chow mein, mushroom chicken, beef n broccoli; fried rice, orange chicken, Beijing beef. Also spring roll sides with sauce. All good."}
{"text":"Usually it's a lot better. This time around I around fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, and a chicken egg roll. The fried rice was spoiled. It tasted so disgusting I couldn't even finish my food. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Use this location many times BUT now that I've become a vegetarian, my meal order has changed. Unfortunately,  Panda Express does not change with the times. Went in Saturday to order for family. Asked what they had in an entree for vegetarians...a veggie stir fry or tofu. Told they had nothing. I was stunned! In today's society very rare to find restaurant that doesn't do something. Especially Asian food which is easily adapted. Family ate, I did not."}
{"text":"I just walked in and waited my turn but the employees didn't acknowledge me and instead we're just talking amongst themselves while playing with a customer's order. Instead of working they looked like they were just playing and not doing their job. I'm not coming back to this Panda Express."}
{"text":"I find it very offensive to not even be greeted by employees when I'm waiting for an employee to even acknowledge me at the beginning of the line to ask me what I would like.  I understand they are busy but it takes more time to look up and stare at me then try and figure out what they were doing after just looking at me with a blank stare than to just say \"Hi, we'll be right with you\" and mean it instead of making everyone feel we are wasting their time.  Yes it is Xmas day but I'm almost positive these employees volunteered to work today so their moods for being here on this day shouldn't be reflected on me."}
{"text":"The food is decent at best. The spring rolls were super salty the rice was tasteless and rather dry. I asked them to do half rice and half chow mien but they gave me all rice. The meats were kind of cold and rubbery in texture. You can honestly get a lot better at one of the places in Carolina place mall."}
{"text":"I'm not from a place that has panda express, but this is delicious. This location is super quick and friendly. I would always get lunch here in my short 30 minutes that I had. The food was always great and fresh. I usually get the chow mein with orange chicken and sweet fire. The new Teriyaki chicken is to die for."}
{"text":"Ive loved Panda Express ever since I was little for their great tasting food. But one visit at this location had me having second thoughts. The food had absolutely no taste to it. It was a bit disturbing when my kung pao had the same plain taste as my orange chicken. It was the first time I didn't clean my plate at Panda. As I moved on to my fortune cookie with the hope of at least a good ending to my horrible visit, as my luck would have it there was no fortune inside my cookie! That visit definitely has had me not return to Panda, even to their other locations with the fear of the same experience."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is one of the best  in the valley. The orange chicken has to set the standard for the rest of the pandas to follow. Or maybe it was just who was cooking at the time. If that is the case every one else needs to take notes from the one who cooked the orange chicken on 8-31-16 at around 12:30. It was with out a doubt the best I have ever had at any panda"}
{"text":"Yes I just keep going back thinking things will get better but in reality they just keep getting worse.  This time the orange chicken had been burned. Nothing like orange chicken with a little bit of burnt flavor to it. I guess I'll forget about it and be back in a few months. I guess I really need to start reading my own reviews"}
{"text":"I was half scared to go there after reading the other reveiws. But I was hungry so I went in anyway I found the tables to be clean and the food to be up to Panda Express standards"}
{"text":"Wow , well done panda express all the reviews said that this location was the worst in the valley. Unfortunately for me, I was freaking hungry had not eaten anything all day long. I figured I would still give it a try even if it has a terrible review. I arrive at  8:12 just to read the  sign posted in on the door we will close at 8:00 today. So I go on the website it still says 9:00 yelp says 9:00 so unless you are here there is no way of knowing this information."}
{"text":"My go to Chinese food place. Taste great and fresh. The sweet and sour is definitely a must if your going to be eating here."}
{"text":"excellent place to stop by for a quick eat.  After paying $30+ for buffets, you come here and pay $8 and get a full steamy meal.  It's quite amazing how cheap and quick you can please your stomach.  The place is quite noisy with a lot of kids/families eating here.  Definitely not a place to impress your date, but if I was by myself and was in a rush, it's one of my top choices :)"}
{"text":"I only go here for lunch since I work nearby.  There service used to be terrible but it seems to have gotten better.  I find when I get frustrated there now its because of the fool in front of me who spent their time in line chatting on their cell phone and now want extra time to decide rice/noodles? chicken/beef? 1 entree or 2? ... you get the idea.    There's also super friendly asian guy who didn't used to work here and seems to have made things better.  He's a bit overbearing but at least he keeps the others moving quickly.  Take it for what it is - fast food.  Not the best meal you'll ever have but certainly not the worst."}
{"text":"Service was bad, we could tell that the food was not fresh and when we asked for fresh they acted as if it was a chore. Not happy with the service, but it was clean."}
{"text":"3.5 stars...rounded up.  I've always been a fan of Panda Express...nor sure why as most of them are usually found in mall food courts, or the like.   This one is clean, quick, convenient, and reasonable - given the portion sizes.  Plus, it's a \"stand alone\" store, which makes it different than the others.    Quite simply, it's Asian fare served swiftly with a good set of choices from mild to spicy.  There's a choice of entrees and sides - all priced according to your hunger level (one, two, or three entree portion sizes).   It's by no means fine dining, but it's a solid alternative when shopping in the Monroeville area and you're looking for flavorful food but not looking for a traditional sit down meal that takes some time.    It's worth the stop...and it won't take long to order and chow down."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered from Panda via Grubhub. My order had no issues.  He ordered  a 3 Entrée meal. When it arrived it was a box of fried rice. THATS ALL. How does this happen?  Well we assume it was a mistake and that they forgot containers. So my husband patiently waits for them to correct their error and called grubhub-  they in turn called panda and long story short don't believe us! Both locations passed the blame to the other and there was no resolution. Really? We're going to lie about receiving a box of rice??  Horrible customer service for grub hub and Panda Express. We eat here often and now won't be back! UPDATE ******* Panda took ownership and messaged me directly to apologize. That shows dedication to customer service standards. Although they previously made a mistake, taking ownership goes along way. Thank you !"}
{"text":"I came in today around 4 pm 2 employees sleeping  on customers table to eat her name is Grecia sleeping & snoring  like a damn pig & the other one I forgot the name & then Ruth charge me for my combo with a damn dirty attitude I will never come back on this location my question is what kind of manager do they have he or she must be one of those ghetto manager"}
{"text":"The worst Service I ever had specially the manager name Tracy Shes very rude & she can hardly speak any English"}
{"text":"This panda is terrible. I went to get food for my family and I. I waited In drive thru for 30 minutes (which I didn't mind since I knew they were busy) I finally pull up to the window to pay and the girl hands me my food with all the lids open so my whole order is fell out into the bag and my drinks didn't have ice in It. I then tell her to fix the drinks and give me new food since all the food fell out in the bottom of the bag mixed together. She told me she couldn't fix It because they're too busy and closed the window on me.   I think it's time to find new employees panda!"}
{"text":"At Panda Express they make fresh food daily and its good. If your looking for a good Chinese/American food, come here for some good food that brings a Chinese culture. Also ask them to make it fresh"}
{"text":"If only the tastes matches the look.   It was a pleasant surprise to be greeted with so much enthusiasm by their staff \"Welcome to Panda Express!\" It reminds me of other friendly Japanese restaurants.   This is the restaurant's first location in in the city.  It has a fast food type setup.  Customers would order from their variety of Chinese food selections which includes combos or individual portions.  They have lots of options so it makes choosing easy.   difficult.    Panda Express is known for their orange chicken.  Though the portions was reasonable for the price, and the flavour was decent. It failed to wow or meet my expectations.  This is due to the fact that the breaded chicken is missing the crispy crunch.  Don't get me wrong, the chicken was crunchy but it has a harder crunch rather than a crispy crunch.    I really hope they improve because I really like how clean and friendly the place is."}
{"text":"Clean, good, consistent food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I am over on this side of town today. I was decently hungry for dinner and decided to stop in the Panda Express . Very clean and the crew is very friendly. Many different entrées are on display for you to choose from. Good price point if you went with 1, 2, or 3 entree size plate. It comes with at least one side which will be rice or chow mein noodles. Calorie count is posted as well to help you make a good choice if you are watching that. I went with the two entree size plate. More than enough for one. I had them take off half the side of chow mein noodles. I'm glad I did. Still good sized portions! I ordered the mushroom chicken and honey walnut shrimp. There was an up charge of $1.25 for the shrimp, which the server will ask you if you're okay with it before adding it to your plate. I also got a side of crispy cheese won tons with sauce on side. I drank water and spent about $10. Decent for Chinese fast food."}
{"text":"My review I sent to corporate and never heard back   Re: Panda Express 690 Estrella Pkwy Goodyear, AZ 85338  To Whom It May Concern: I have tried to use your contact form on your website, but 400 characters is not enough, and no one ever responded back to me when I did try to submit a complaint.  I normally don't complain but I have 3 different issues that happened at this location and to be honest it is getting tiring. Issue #1 About a month ago I went to the drive through and ordered a 3-plate meal with Teriyaki chicken.  When I got to the window the girl asked me if I wanted any sauce. I said yes Teriyaki sauce and I was informed it would be a 15-minute wait if I wanted sauce. So why was I not told that when I placed my order.  Dry Teriyaki chicken for dinner. Yummy, I wasn't waiting another 15 minutes after 10 minutes in the drive through. Issue # 2 My husband and I go back for dinner a week ago and we order. When we get to pay I was wondering if they had a tray to put all our food on.  Fernando who was working the register points down the line and says yeah, they are back there.  Very helpful. Issue # 3 Yet again we love Panda, so we order online today.  I ordered a Teriyaki Bowl with white rice, a 3-entrée plate with orange chicken and Teriyaki chicken x 2, and another 3-entrée plate with orange chicken and Teriyaki chicken x 2, a chicken eggroll and cream cheese Rangoon.  It said our order would be ready at 4pm so we drove over and gave our name.  When we got there the order was not ready, so she starts to make the order. Here I will say the girl who made the order was very nice.  While she is making the orders, she tells us it is going to be a 15-minute wait for the teriyaki chicken.  I told her we placed the order 20 minutes ago and we are not waiting another 15 minutes.  She asks what else we would like so we then pick Honey Sesame chicken.  As she gets the order together she then tells me they do not have enough honey sesame chicken, and asks what else I would like. Strike 2. I asked for 2 chicken egg rolls instead.  As she is packing up the order she drops the chicken egg rolls on the floor and informs me they have not dropped any new eggrolls and it would be another 8 minutes.  Strike 3 on this order.  Now we must pick something else and the choices are limited because my husband only eats certain things on your menu.  So, we end up getting more orange chicken.  The whole order was a complete mess.  As you can see we are loyal customers but at this point I am discouraged from ordering form your establishment again."}
{"text":"I'm currently in the drive thru, been stuck here 40 minutes and I get to the window and they have don't have teriyaki chicken. How nice is that? I gave 1 star because I can't leave a zero. Poor management."}
{"text":"I love this location! The whole crew is very nice and friendly! I'm always here on Saturdays and encountered excellent customer service provided by Casey!   The food is always fresh and delish! Recommended Panda Express location!"}
{"text":"I work near this Panda so I have given it several chance, yet each time I'm disappointed. I know get my everyone around here would rather drive out of their way to go the one off of Van Burn. Their entree's are always sitting out for an extended period of time, making the chicken soggy and chewy (gross). When you ask if you could get a fresh batch they roll their eyes and act as if its the biggest inconvenience to do their job, and today my request was just ignored (because there was still one mushy serving left) until I walked out. When I have been there when it is miraculously busy, they act so frantic and unorganized as if they'd never seen more than 5 people in their restaurant at a time. By far the worst Panda I have ever been to; food and service wise. never again."}
{"text":"Food was hot fresh and very tasty for being fast food price and value was fare I will go back store was clean and busy staff seemed helpful friendly and accurate nothing to complain about"}
{"text":"Contrary to some of the other reviews, I thought the food was ok for the price and cafeteria style set-up.  I visited on a Saturday afternoon, there was a line and service was a bit slow, but not too bad.  I opted for the big plate, 2 entrees and 1 side (or 1/2 and 1/2).  I chose the mushroom chicken and teriyaki chicken, with 1/2 fried rice and 1/2 steamed veggies, for $7.00.  The teriyaki chicken consists of whole chicken thighs, which are chopped to order, nice portion, approx 1 and 1/2 thighs, standard teriyaki sauce.  The teriyaki chicken, rice and veggies were typical food court fare.  I didn't care for the mushroom chicken.  The texture of the chicken was a bit weird, didn't finish it.  I would return, but this won't be my go-to place."}
{"text":"it's like they purposefully hire slow, rude idiots.  i'm not sure why i give this place a chance occasionally, maybe it's for the guy who looks like adam scott. food is always old tasting, my order has never been correct, and they actually wanted to charge me more this last time to correct it. 40 minutes for me to get through, with 3 people ahead of me.  do yourself a favor and have respect for your gut and the chinese culture and go down the street to lucky star dining for far superior food for the same price."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh, always given to you in a timely fashion. Very nice people, they just nickel and dime you for everything,ugh, it gets old."}
{"text":"With having 7 kids going out is a budgeted expense but Panda never lets us down. The kids are always happy and we are too with the cost! Food is top notch and so is the service."}
{"text":"This panda express has never disappointed me and I've been going here since it opened. To all the negativity, pull some sticks out of your butts and go get a job yourself."}
{"text":"I'm a Panda Express fan and I've eaten at the Primm Buffalo Bill location on many occasions.  It's fine.  It's mostly like any other Panda, except this location, like mall locations, doesn't have the fresh brewed China MIst iced tea, which is the best iced tea that I've had at any fast food locations.  Also, no free refills  =(  The food is pretty much the same, although it seems like the rice and noodles are a little more greasy and tired looking than at my Panda.  I'll keep eating there, but it's not my favorite Panda Express location."}
{"text":"I was here on 4/5/2018 and the cook that was cooking had never cooked before so everything was empty to choose from I had to wait for my spicy kung pao chicken like i said the cook had traded with the real cook on a Friday and the line in the drive thur were having to wait out front for there meals it was a mess mess mess I ask the guy what in the world was going on and he said I am the real cook but we decided to trade today and I told him well you need to go back there and help her because there's nothing in the line and he told me oh well that's her problem not his problem and then I told him that it was bad for the company and the guy in charge that night was just sitting in his office not doing nothing about what was going on.  P.S. I forgot to say I had to ask for a to go box because I had already finished my entire meal and as I finished it then they bring me a small portion of my spicy kung pao chicken I mean very small portion it only took up 1/4 of the to go panda express box so I had to bring it home and saved it for another day because it took them 30 minutes before they bought it out to me and I was very upset on that.    Well we went today on 4/18/2018 one hour before closing and everything was back to normal the only thing I didn't like is that i order there new dish steak and shrimp and you pay $1.25 for it and you only get 2 shrimps and two pieces of steak now I don't mind paying the extra money but hey guys aleast give up the steak and shrimps and make it worth the money and leave out the potatoes add more greens and peanuts and carrots not POTATOES that's not a good combination with the shrimp and steak sorry you get more potatoes then you ask for and 2 shrimps and 2 pieces of meat not fair for what your paying the extra $1.25 for and everyone was very friendly tonight but I think the main ownership was there that's why everything was running smoothly and as soon as you walk in tonight even the cooks were saying hi welcome to panda express but once again that's because the main owner was there once she leaves it'll go back to not having food on the line again and people slacking again.    Thank you for the acknowledgement.  I really appreciate it."}
{"text":"Terrible, shame on me for wanting food 20 minutes before they close. They're all out, didn't even ask if I'd wait to cook it."}
{"text":"Thatvwas the worst food i have ever gotten delivered. The crab ragoon and eggs rolls were re-fried. Did not recieve orange chicken or white rice. I could hardly eat any of the meal, just gross"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, tried to make the order easy as possible: 3 plates to go same exact thing but the idiot was saying I can only do one at a time in a very rude tone. I said it will be he same for all 3 plates and he kept asking me what I wanted for two, if I wanted sauce I said no and the same for all plates. He barely put anything in our plates and didn't even cut the teriyaki chicken right. Bunch of FOBS. I will NEVER go back to this location, if you want PANDA just go to the blue diamond location they're more friendlier and also will hook it up with the servings.   The only nice person we dealt with was the cashier. So thanks to the cashier, you should be the manager and get new staff."}
{"text":"Awful customer service! If u have an unmotivated slacker of a teenager looking for their first job, then this is the place for your kid to start their career. Inside the store is pretty bad but the drive-thru (aka the Wait-thru) is amazingly slow. Especially since they just scoop the food into a container! U better have 10 to 15 minutes to spare, for some reason. But hey u get a free sample sometimes, so there's always that."}
{"text":"Three reviews in a row on fast food (go me!) People love to treat fast food as if it was fine dining lol. This is a great location. Great spot, you can see it from the street when you drive by. It's on north Durango and 215. I was going to go to the one in Centennial Center but I noticed this one so I decided to check it out real quick. It's right by the Buffalo Wild Wings (yes, I had to resist going there instead) and there's a parking lot for it. The location is very clean and the works are very nice. Chloe specifically was great to work with and very happy! You can sample anything you want so I love trying to new items they have on the menu. I got all chow mein, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli. What's great about Panda Express is that if you ask for it fresh, they have to make it fresh (unless they're closing within an hour.) I love their beijing beef as well. All Pepsi products (try not to cry.) Anyway, for a fast food place it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"Great service- also well done on having a person who speaks clear English and can hear me taking my order.  Why on your children's honey walnut shrimp order why do you skimp on this?"}
{"text":"25 minutes in the drive thru line & there were only 4 cars ahead of me. I'm not sure what they are doing wrong, but this is crazy."}
{"text":"Worst customer service in the city. Anna (I believe she was the manager) was rude and condescending. She was rolling her eyes and snapping at us, I walked away and left my husband at the counter. Then we get home and eat and I bite down on some bone or gristle, there goes my lunch. I am done with Panda Express."}
{"text":"Worst panda Express  ever ... customer service is terrible. They dont have people skills. They have attitude.  Manager is horrible. They never have the food I want and it doesn't have any flavors like the other panda. The tables and chairs are always dirty. and there no team leadership   \"\"\"\"\"\" \"WORST PANDA EXPRESS \"\"\"\"\"\"\"             I RATE THIS -100"}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at this Panda location. I went through the drive-thru last night around 6:30-7pm and a female employee was quick to take my order and also very polite. When I pulled up to the window, my payment was processed promptly, and food delivered shortly after. The portion size was generous, and my food was still hot after arriving home. Judging by the other reviews, this location seems to have stepped up their game."}
{"text":"I just left this restaurant completely embarrassed by cashier Tammy. I just got off work and was trying to get food to feed my family on the way home. My order all together was $30.52.  Now mind you two people ahead me had an order as well exceeding $30.00 and Tammy did not ask for a photo ID and they were Caucasian....the African American gentleman before me paid in cash and was treated rudely as myself. I got to the cashier portion of the line to pay and Tammy rudely asked me \"where is your order!?\", I politely gesture to my entree's and asked for a large cup as well. Instead of handing me my cup she says \"the biggest cups right there just grab one\". Then she kept looking at my credit card and looking at me with an odd look and then says \"I need to see a photo ID\".  I just got off work, wallets in my work bag all I have is my credit card in hand with my name on it. When I asked her why she needed it she stated it was store policy but when asked why the couple two spots ahead of me weren't asked for an ID she completely ignored me and asked for a photo ID. I feel I was treated unfairly simply because I am Hispanic.  I have frequently visited this Panda Express and my wife loves this place. But after being treated like I'm a criminal in front of a packed restaurant I will never step foot in this franchise again.  You hear about things like this in the news and think this can't happen to me, and then it does....."}
{"text":"This is a perfect example of a delivery gone wrong!! Our 1st time ordering from Uber Eats from here, and it was horrible! Well, the delivery was timely!! The actual order?? Screwed up!! Ordered $52 worth of food, and all of it was mixed up and missing parts! Chow mein mixed with white rice, instead of fried rice! Chow mein mixed together in another order. Ordered 4 spring rolls and only got 2!! AND THEY WERE BURNED!! No sweet and sour sauce included either! So, instead of relying on the restaurant getting the order right, and staying in, my wife had to get in the car and run back to the restaurant and get the rest of the stuff we ordered!! She is not a happy camper!  So now, the dinner is cold and the family is upset!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had just been to a visitation and we decided to grab a bite.  As my wife loves Chinese food we decided to give this place a try.  The set-up is similar to a fast food place in a mall.  You pick a rice or noodle and add 1, 2 or 3 meat dishes   My wife ordered the sriracha shrimp with orange chicken and fried rice.  I had the lo mien noodles with orange chicken and ginger chicken.  I actually wanted steamed veggies and a beef dish but the selection was limited.  Bad timing I guess.    Our order with one shared fountain drink and two egg rolls $27.60.  I must say I though that was a bit steep.  The rice was bland and the ginger chicken pieces were tough.  However, my wife could not get enough of the shrimp.  She even went back for some more To-Go but it was sold out.    Clearly you can get a better selection and half the price in a Mall."}
{"text":"I come here often and one girl ruined my night. They are usually pretty good and nice and friendly. Blanca was on the register and threw my order into the bag. She also did not give me a fortune cookie and gave me attitude as well. That is unacceptable and I never want service like that from my local panda like that again."}
{"text":"The service isn't great, the store is relatively clean but the food is terrible. The orange chicken is way too spicy and the fried rice tastes like cardboard. The water cups are way too small like for Pete's sake we live in Arizona."}
{"text":"I visited this location on 1/18/16 with my wife. When we walked in there was no line but we waited over five minutes to be acknowledged. Not the biggest deal in the world. However, there was an employee name Ruby (pretty sure that is her name) who was off and gathering food for herself to take home that was causing the back up. I think the manager should have had her wait until the customers were helped but again not the biggest deal. However, the thing that was a big deal is that while she was gathering her food she started to chop up the teriyaki chicken and I guess some of it got on her fingers. She could not resist washing that teriyaki goodness off her hands and instead opted to start sucking on and licking the hell out of her hands. Ok that's pretty gross but at least she won't touch anymore food or utensils right? WRONG! She went back in for more and and chopped up more food and was touching the cutting board the where they chop the chicken. Then she went right back to sucking on her fingers! I had already ordered teriyaki chicken and they chopped up my order on the same cutting board using the same utensils that she just slobbered on. I did pay for the meal but asked for a manager. There was no manager on duty but the person in charge that I spoke to told me that she can't say much to that girl because it was only her second day. I get it, she is new, but it makes sense to me that before you allow people to handle food you tell them that they can't put their fingers in their mouths. They remade my order using new utensils and a cutting board and gave me 10% off coupon (wont be using that) and sent me on my way. I called the corporate number and they told me they were sorry and that they would send the info to the area manager but it felt very scripted. Just watch what these people are doing because there is clearly a gap in training their under the management and this is a pretty big health department violation."}
{"text":"Wow. What can I say. Came in right at dinner time (6:30) and all the food was stale. I asked if they could make the food fresh and they tried to tell me that the food was fresh or that there was enough to fill the order and there clearly wasn't. The string bean chicken had been sitting for at least an hour (the green beans were super old). They have a new manager and he needs to be supervised. This place is run really poorly."}
{"text":"Not a word was said!  I ordered and paid online, printed my receipt. After I had completed my order their website instructed me to go to the store, stand in the \"Express Pickup Line\" and pick up my order at a designated time.   I walked into the store, there is no \"Express Pickup Line\" so I bypassed other customers to pick up my order. I told the lady I was there to pick an order, she saw the paper receipt in my hand and motioned for me to give it to her. She read the receipt, grabbed the order and handed it to me. I said thank you and she nodded her head.  Not a word was said, no greeting, not a thank you or is there anything else I can get for you.   Food was marginal, but the treatment was poor. I hat leaving poor reviews, but they deserve it."}
{"text":"Never going to this Panda Express again. The past couple times I've been My food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. Second off, it was a big deal when I told the cashier I had change when darted after I gave him some bills. He was very rude and didn't go out of his way to help me. Lastly, I found a hair in my food."}
{"text":"Where was the owner today? The wait was at least  30 minutes. According to the counter helpers, the cooks didn't show up. I had mushroom chicken with no mushrooms, black pepper chicken with barely any chicken and we were done eating by the time the walnut shrimp was ready. The kids behind the counter tried their best but they were not equipped to handle this situation. Food was too slow coming out and wasn't very good when it did. We also paid for the lady behind up because her meal was mistakenly added to ours. We thought it would have been to much for the cashier to figure out how to refund and recharge so we just paid for it. The owner & manager needs some more lessons on how to pull of great food no matter what the circumstances. The senior members of my family were very stressed & unsatisfied with today's visit. The 2 stars are for the workers giving it their best today."}
{"text":"Food tasted good but they are very very stingy with the entrees. My to go container is 90%rice. Four pieces of orange chicken and maybe 5 pieces of sweet fire chicken. Pitiful. They didn't even fill the two small spots in the container. Geez for $7.56 I might have an ounce of meat."}
{"text":"Tried Panda Express for the first time last week.  Ordered (online) fried rice, vegetables, broccoli beef and pork.  It was about noon so I tried the drive thru to pick up my order.  No one there.  So I went inside to see a fairly long line.  So I went to the cashier to pick up my order.  After some discussion about the fried rice not being available (it was) my order was packaged.  It looked awfully small in the carry out containers.  Did not receive my pork entree so I had to go back.  The broccoli was uncooked but the entrees, although very small in quantity were very good.  There was an abundance of the fried rice.  After reading all the reviews, I will not recommend this Panda Express."}
{"text":"Despite the long line I was very happy about Panda Express.  I got the black pepper chicken and I can't stop thinking about how I want to go back for more.  Soooo good and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The worst Panda Express location ever. It never fails they're always out of something orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, rice (uh rice...). It doesn't matter the time of day or year. If they're not out of something the food is not fresh either dried out entrees or vegetables turning brown. Only reason I gave two stars was cause the manager was nice...the rest of the people on the line...resting bleep   6/7/17: Here we go again Asked for half brown rice half mixed veggies waited for the veggies and I got 5 pieces of very fresh veggies but again only 5 of them with a pound of brown rice. Always something at this location."}
{"text":"The food was great! The chicken was actually crispy for the first time!!! Everything was served nice and hot! I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place hasn't replaced management. We go there alot. Every time they are out of multiple items. Ragoons are always over cooked or burnt. Staff doesn't seem to care. Management doesn't seem to care either. You would think they would be prepared for the dinner rush but they never are. With all the other complaints that I have read, you would think that corporate would have taken notice."}
{"text":"This one has been one of the worst panda I have visited, waited ten minutes to be served. The general manager gave my son a dirty look for choosing the orange chicken instead of the shrimp he sampled. The food was cold, and our bowls were 90% rice and 10% meat. My daughters kids meal only had two pieces of chicken on her plate. The general manager also ran from behind the counter to harass my son about what was in his water cup. Every time I visit panda it keeps going down hill, I was thinking maybe a different state it would be better, but nope. Seems like the quality at Panda has been rapidly decreasing in the past few years. This one has been the worst I've been to."}
{"text":"A very positive experience, the lone in and rice were perfectly prepared; given that they are fast food. The pepper beef had a really juicy flavor on the interior and a very great texture on the exterior. The egg roll however, was less than good. Arguably to salty and sort of had a heated up flavor."}
{"text":"From 3/5/15 This was my first time trying Panda Express, and I was unaware that it was buffet style. I got the honey glazed walnut shrimp with chow mein and mixed veggies.Taste and flavoring wise it I have to say not bad. I would eat, here again. The service was decent too, fast and friendly"}
{"text":"The server Brayam R was very delightful. Actually this location, the workers are always pleasant. I was so glad I got there before rush hour and my food was delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"We will not be back at this location!  Employees talk about you behind your back because we complain about the portions!  We've come every week and the portions vary every time.  We complain and the employee just argues  with you.  They don't even provide knifes, try to eat the Teriyaki chicken without one!"}
{"text":"The girl in charge when I went there for some noodles refused to give me a sauce (hot oil). I have gotten this sauce from this location many times before and I offered to pay for it but she refused claiming \"she could lose her job\". It's a sauce that they already carry at their location. I don't understand why she couldn't give to me even after I offered to pay. Will not be returning to panda again."}
{"text":"Horrible wait times in drive thru. Been there 3 times and had to pull around and wait every time. Always out of orange chicken and service is crap. Use dysart and McDowell way better."}
{"text":"When did they make the orange chicken spicy??!!! My kids loved the orange chicken and we use to eat here often, kids won't eat the orange chicken now! Boooo"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews for such corporate places but I was so impressed by this panda express every this was fresh and clean and everyone was very nice I had ying check in me more then once and she was so sweet to everyone."}
{"text":"Didnt feel great after eating this. Poor service. But good veggie options as always. Too expensive.  When i went there they ran out of spring rolls. Definitely not filling either."}
{"text":"Stupid stupid stupid employee.. Ordered 2 plates and bowls to go. Got home rice was awful, not cooked. It was cracking and crunch. She was Asian and in a hurry cause its lunch time and they were busy. Awful service and awful food. I called the store and one of the girls said If you have time come back and replace it. Really dumb a@@? At what point does a business have to reach to serve uncooked Food. I recommend everyone to go to the neighboring restaurants. This place is awful. I am not being harsh, a restaurant should not serve raw rice, just ask to wait or pick another option. Calling Corp Monday can't wait to see what they say.."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best fast food places above Mc Donalds. Have to be careful as I do have a minor allergy to sesame, so I have to ask which things I can have before I purchase a meal."}
{"text":"Visited last night 30 minutes before closing.... There was only one young lady taking/making the orders and ringing them up as well. There was one person in front of me so I'm patiently waiting. In walks 4 Hispanic women after me. After the customer before me she walks over and looks at the Hispanic women and say \"how may I help you\" like I wasn't stand there. I put my hand in the stop, wait motion and said I was here 1st and I proceeded to order. I don't know how you can make a mistake who was here 1st when I'm clearly in line before. My son loves Panda and eats it at least 2-4 times a month. I have a 1-3 strike rule and Panda is on there 2nd strike with me and the next incident I have I'm going to be done spending my money with them!!! I'm going to blame the mishap last night with the young lady as her being tired from a long days work.  I understand it's a fast food restaurant and the staff deals with thousands of people, but do they not get trained in good customer service manners?"}
{"text":"Best Panda Express in all of the land! Never had a bad experience here, unlike most pandas."}
{"text":"We love this place.   So happy it opened.  Food is fresh and service is great.   Ramzia was amazing.  You can tell she takes pride in what she does.  Hard to find employees like her these days.   Jami wasn't bad either ( #1 panda ). Lol"}
{"text":"Worst ever 2 shrimp 6 BITES OF steak! All potatoes! Sucked won't be back! -1 for review!"}
{"text":"Worst organization ever send me to the next speaker then do not pick up at that speaker but take all orders behind me I was waiting until they honked behind me then left sitting in line until I get to the window then the rude I mean rude girl goes oh sorry we were busy which wasn't true when I arrived at the order there were no cars ahead of me in fact before I pulled up to the speaker I had sat for at least 5 minutes so I know this place doesn't give a crap at losing business but I can tell you that they should review what good customer service is because the girl didn't even ask if I wanted to order or to make any concessions just treated me disrespectfully with attitude and rudeness when I tried to explain what had happened"}
{"text":"Are you people insane?  If you think that Panda Express is good Chinese food, then you must also think Sbarro is awesome Italian food.  This place is at best a decent option at an airport.  The chicken dishes are stringy.  The beef dished are tough.  Their fried rice is bland.  If you are stuck somewhere and this is the only option, it will not make you sick.  If you are not stuck somewhere, please yelp a non-chain Chinese option."}
{"text":"This location is often very busy! The staff does great job of getting you out the door with the correct order consistently. My girl thinks the chunks of onion are way too BIG in anything they are in . I think the chunks of cabbage are way too BIG in anything they are in . Also seems they change their menu or discontinue item way to often. Soon as I find something new I like it disappears almost every time . Overall this location and panda rocks and is filling at a good price, take the survey on the receipt and get a free entree next time you visit !"}
{"text":"i wrote the corporate office about the poor quality of our food last night - a waste of money in my opinion. we'll see what they say, if anything. highly highly highly highly highly doubtful i'll go back."}
{"text":"I have to admit every time I go I must get lucky! I always have fresh chow mein or Kung Pao Chicken. Every time I step in they're either making a new batch or it was just prepared. Also, please keep in mind Panda hires young workers too, and sometimes they get overwhelmed with the long line. Which is understandable. Just because we are \"hangry\" doesn't mean we need to be rude customers either. One time I saw a lady order 5 plates, 2 bowls and some sides. I guess the cashier was taking too long, and the customer wanted her money back. Like of course, you're gonna hold up the line, so don't get mad at the cashier    Anyway, great job! Keep up the great work! I would just suggest to have more staff during peak times. Monitor those times so you'll be well-prepared for any rush."}
{"text":"Panda Express is always a good option for Chinese \"fast\" food. This location is nice and renovated, but the service was slow. This was only one guy working the display and the register was failing to work, causing it to take 3 minute to process my card. Overall this is a good location with good tasting food, but the service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"I'm (almost) speechless. This Panda is so egregiously disgusting. A steaming dump taken by one of their employees and slopped into my take-out box would have been more acceptable than this shit. Rock-hard peas and other unidentifiable bits in my fried rice. Who knows the last time that shit had been cleaned? Ligaments and other unchewables.... Entirely unconcerned high school staff. Do yourself a favor and drive down to 39th and Thomas for an entirely different experience. I count myself lucky I didn't get ill."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the low rating of this establishment. I have hated Panda Express my entire life, until my boyfriend convinced me to try this location. This particular PE is exceptional in dish quality and freshness. I went to the drive-through Panda in Scottsdale...spare yourself the waste of money and disgusting slop you'll get there. The employees at this Panda are constantly cooking and changing out the hot foods. They display the fresh vegetables they use on a daily basis. With the open kitchen, you can see how the food is handled and cooked, and the staff does so with the utmost respect. I cannot emphasize how FRESH this location is. They completely one-eightied my view on Panda Express."}
{"text":"The food was okay at this Panda Express, and does not come close to Panda Express' we have visited in the Portland, Oregon area."}
{"text":"Convenient and fast with reasonable prices. A nice alternative to burgers and fries.   The food is ok. I had no complaints. I did find that many of the meat options were fried and sauteed in some sort of sauce. Like most Chinese places the food tends to be on the greasy side and leaves you feeling a bit sluggish afterwards.  The staff do their job efficiently but without smiles or unnecessary chit chat. All business."}
{"text":"The manager here was awful. I asked for extra hot sauce and she gave me a dirty look like if it was such an inconvenience to give me extra hot sauce. She was not pleasant at all. I then drove all the way home to realize she forgot to give me fresh Kung Pao Chicken which we waited 15 minutes for. I drove all the way back to get the chicken and she showed no sympathy at all, didn't even say sorry then she started being sarcastic asking me if I wanted more hot sauce. -_- I will never go there again."}
{"text":"This is THE worst Panda Express I have ever been to. I used to live across the street so would come when I was too lazy to cook. The drive thru is horrible. You wait 20 minutes every single time, I don't even know why I bother. I finally moved out of my apartment and while moving we stopped. I waited in the drive thru for 23 minutes! This wouldn't be so bad if the employees were not so rude. They throw your food at you and don't even pretend to care about customer service. There is one worker there who either can't speak English, is mute, or she literally doesn't care. I'm hoping it's a language barrier or she is a mute because why someone would hire someone like her is something I cannot grasp. I have never been inside this location so I can't say if it's any better inside but you might as well plan for 30 minutes in the drive thru just to be on the safe side."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Had to wait for 1 of my entrees as wasn't prepared. Was offered a drink.  Wait time 5 minutes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Panda Express in the Vegas area. The staff is friendly and welcoming. They also give a lot of food where as MOST other PE' employees are becoming super cheap with the portions and acting as if they are the one buying the food. Also, this PE is staying true to their roots and leaves a bowl of fortune cookies out for you to take as many as you please. I have a PE less than a mile away from me and I choose to drive 4 miles away to have a pleasant experience at this one =]"}
{"text":"Great thing about PE is that the taste of the food is usually the same. For the amount of food and price, you really get what you pay for. I love getting half noodles and half rice, with orange chicken and kung pao chicken."}
{"text":"Bbllllaaaahhhhh! The food is mediocre and the same no matter which panda express you go to. The line was long, long, long, and even when we got through the line, the lady, as loud as she was, I couldn't understand very well.  Once I got my food, some of the beef tasted burnt, from sitting under the heat lamp. And the chow neon was like chow me in, very blah. Probably won't come back, only came for my kids to eat quickly before the movie."}
{"text":"Don't eat a lot of Panda Express.  However, this location seems to have friendly employees.  My 3yr old and I stopped in for a quick bite.  In our time eating,  every employee was busy. Cleaning,  helping customers and taking drive thru orders.  The food is typical PE food. Anyone expecting gourmet food, needs to eat at an actual Chinese restaurant.  We would definitely eat here again, when in the area. The store was clean and the friendly staff are the reason."}
{"text":"Giving them three stars because they need to work on customer service skills and just smiling in general. I was literally standing with the food on a plate ready to dine in. The rep saw me and carried on cutting chicken and the other rep was counting money. Luckily my food wasn't cold. Freshly made and actually tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible panda, would recommend to go else where... The workers were very rude and not only that but they did not even fill the kids meal even close to half full and made the bowl wrong so I kindly went up and asked if they could make the bowl again and the lady at the register was very snappy and didn't show any form of proper customer service. Won't be back again..."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed.  My daughter was so excited when she found out they were putting in a Panda Express so we had to give it a try.  I was very disappointed.  Portions were very small for the price and the rice was very dry.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was uninspiring, even for mall-style Chinese food. Noodles were alright but the \"Main Courses\" were not very good and were made up of approximately 80% veggies, with barely any meat to satisfy me. The staff was nice, but many tables were left filthy with food from previous diners. I don't regret going, only because now I know I never have to go back. Avoid, even if your Chinese food cravings seem unavoidable and over powering."}
{"text":"both individuals who helped my wife and I were very personable. They were quick and were obviously happy to help. They asked if there was anything that we would like to sample before deciding. They had natural smiles on their faces."}
{"text":"Typical Panda Express, but add a drive thru. Service is not exceptionally friendly, but lets face it, who cares. You have to deal with the employees for a whole minute and a half. Food is always good, portions are generally good, and close to shopping."}
{"text":"I thought it was fast food, not rushed food. My experience at this location was incredibly unpleasant. For starters the food was not fresh, it has been in my previous visits. When we got to the broccoli and beef, which didn't have enough to fill the 3rd item container, but it's all good!he gave me a scarce amount of a fourth item for free, as opposed to letting me wait a few minutes for the kitchen to make a fresh batch. They did after all have 3hours left before closing time,Which was the most upsetting reason behind the feeling of being rushed. Only to start eating my food and realize it wasn't fresh. Forget the fact the server gave as if it was coming off his plate, The manners of the guy serving us need work. Will return but it is best to go during the day in my experience."}
{"text":"Quick service, great food, clean and comfortable restaurant, a thoroughly enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Disinterested employees, slow service and lack of communication between personnel give this panda 3 stars. Panda is pretty much the same everywhere with flavor.they gave me the bottom of the barrel orange chicken which pissed me off but whatever. I'm over it. Won't be my first choice for a quick meal anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times since they opened.  But the service is getting worse all the time.  It takes forever to get through the car line and they make sure you can't just leave based on the configuration of the traffic pattern they created going to the drive up window.  They NEVER have everything on the menu available--they will make stuff  but it takes 8 minutes or more at the window.  The best dish--one that I like a lot is Chicken and Green Beans.  It's hardly ever available.  The fired rice is so-so.  The steamed brown rice is very good but hardly ever available....going there is a crap shoot."}
{"text":"Probably the worst panda. This store hires large kids that work slowly. They refused to make more vegetables , half the menu was empty and the kids were just hangin out."}
{"text":"if I could give this place a NEGATIVE star I would! I ordered the Shanghai Beef, was told it would be 1.00 more, they \"padded\" it with a HUGE pile of kung pau chicken. This was for my 3 year old, I saw the beef on top, gave him his food...then I heard SCREAMING!!!!!!!!! He bit into a pepper....REAL nice Panda REAL nice"}
{"text":"We have lived in the area even before the plaza was built that houses this Panda Express location. With that being said we have frequented your location ALOT over the years. I have to say that with all of the changes that you have made to your business I don't go there very much anymore. First it was smaller portions, then higher prices with the smaller portions. Then new containers that held even smaller portions yet and then higher prices again.   By far my trip in tonight just confirmed why I have not been back much.   We walked in 30 min before closing and the counter was a mess, they were out of several things including rice. We placed our order and asked how long for more rice and right then she yelled for them to make rice and told us 5 min. She took our order by writing it on the bottom of our plate which she turned upside down on the filthy counter. The plate which she then was going to fill our food with. I was discusted and asked her to please get a different plate for our food she was not thrilled. Then she put our plates aside and without putting any of our order together proceeded to help people behind us, we started seeing the very same items we had just ordered starting to disappear. Needless to say I was not just waiting on rice for the other items we ordered to run out so we could wait longer.  So I said could you please load our items while the rice is being made before you put all of the rest left on others plates behind us and she looked at me and said I am Watching the portions. Then after loading 4 other customers she finally started to fill ours. Complete disappointment is an understatement of what our plates contained.   We both ordered Beef and Broccoli and my plate had literally 3 small pieces of Broccoli and 3 small pieces of meat,  the Sweet fire chicken had 5 very small pieces of chicken and some pineapple. The noodles and rice where minimal at best.  Even with your reduction in portion sizes lately this was by far the worst meal I have ever gotten from you. My daughter's meal was just as bad. I wish I could post a picture because it would prove that I have not exaggerated at all in my description.   Very sad to see an establishment that we enjoyed going to go downhill. From one business owner to another I hope you take a little more pride in your business and step it up a little on the quality end. Especially when you are raising cost and serving less food. There are alot of other places to go right down the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is my first 1 star rating I have given on Yelp. For the past three visits, my family and I have been getting less and less food. They also have the habit of forgetting to include sauces with the teriyaki. Compared to other branches, this location is incredibly stingy and incompetent. Take your money and business somewhere else."}
{"text":"The service wasn't very friendly I had to wait a long time that gave me the wrong order I won't be back"}
{"text":"Craving fast food? Here's a quick fix, but I recommend going in to see what's fresh and if what you want isnt plentiful just ask since they refill regularly."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I honestly love Panda Express, its usually so fresh and healthy. I'd say this is not a good Panda Express. I dont like that you cant get everything on the menu.   I ask for brown rice every time and they say everytime they don't have any. So are they always out or dont carry everything on the menu? I got rice and mixed veggies with kung pow and teriyaki chicken with a side of rangoons. I waited 10 minutes for the mixed veggies. Mind you I'm on my lunch break. Then I had to wait an additional 10 minutes because they forgot about my rangoons. I listened to the manager yell at the girl who was working in front of customers. Seriously that needs to be done in the back not in the front. By the time my food came the chicken was cold, the teriyaki sauce is very watery and not kinda thick like every other Panda I've been to or the bottles they sell. I had to ask him for soy sauce because they don't offer it.   I would say don't expect much when you go here."}
{"text":"I've written a review of 2 stars before. And I am updating my review. Still the worst panda out of all the pandas I've been to. I've been to a lot trying to eat a bit healthier than normal fast food. I did say a bit, I know fast food is unhealthy. But my lunches are short and if I forget to bring a healthy lunch I have my choice of expensive restaurants, pretzels, panda and potato hut, btw potato hut is worse than panda.   So anyways the stepped up their Kung pow chicken it's spicy now! That's a plus! But the ran goons were dry and cold. They don't make them fresh when you order here.  so the Kung pow brought my hopes up and the rangoons brought them back down. Oh well. The shrimp was cold and old. The chow mein needs some flavor. Still no brown rice.   Little Mexican girl was really nice. Poor girl got slammed after I got my food."}
{"text":"Always always gets the order wrong thru drive thru!! When its not a whole plate missing its something else.  Its been multiple times"}
{"text":"After dining in about every chinese restaurant in town......this by far is the tastiest, consistant, best value in town.     The staff is usually friendly, the place is very clean.  I like the fact that they offer samples of their food if you need to.  I eat there at least once a month."}
{"text":"So these Chinese spareribs they show pictures of are nothing what there actually selling.   What they actually are is one inch long ribs. False advertising   Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I like the food here. I decided to try the new option to order online. Do yourself a favor and don't bother. It took me longer than if I'd walked in. I got there and the order hadn't even been started. So he starts making it when I tell him I'm there to pick up the order, which I was doing so at the specified time the website gave me, and there is absolutely no rice made. He tells me it will be a few minutes. Then he gives me my drink cups to fill. Now why did I choose specific beverages online if I was going to have to fill them myself anyways? I waited an additional 12 minutes for them to prepare the rice and assemble my meals. That's a long time considering you can walk in and get what you want immediately. Not sure I'd do the online thing again. Maybe they're still working the kinks out. At least the last apologized when I mentioned my concerns."}
{"text":"I honestly can't say much about this place.  Mediocre fast food.    The store was clean & the service was fast.  I would rather the walnut shrimp not be stuck together.  Also, when someone asks to try something that means try not scoop a big spoonful on the plate.  I said, \"Oh no, I only wanted to try.  Never had that one\" Her reply, \"Oh, I like it.\"  Well the place was clean, food was fresh & I left full."}
{"text":"The food is great but they are Rud here! Need better customer service. I kept repeating what I wanted for entree. We were going to eat in the restaurant only to place my order in a Togo bag. When I told her she gave me attitude. Not cool"}
{"text":"I don't know why my stomach gets upset every time I eat at this particular restaurant, I've eaten at other Panda Express and loved it. I just can't eat here. I hope u chose wisely"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for grilled Chicken Teriyaki. Every time I come here it's SOOOO SLOOOW."}
{"text":"Seems that I am always held up in the drive thru line because they are continuously low on one of the items I continue to purchase. Funny because the other people must feel the same way because each car has to wait 5-10 minutes every time I come here. Food not consistent in quality, actually kind of better quality when I have to wait because it is more fresh, but as a ex-worker in the restaurant business, I know it isn't hard to have consistently fresh food."}
{"text":"Panda Express... It's a guilty pleasure. Once in a while I'll crave their orange chicken & chow mein. Doesn't matter what anyone says... It's not authentic and blah blah. I don't care. Sometimes I just want Pandas orange chicken & chow mein and Panda will always deliver."}
{"text":"Inside of Von's. Fresh, quick and they let you try anything you want, just ask for a taste. My fav is the orange chicken and bejing beef. The service is fast, friendly and there is a little spot with about 5 tables/chairs for you to sit and enjoy your meal before you dive into the grocery store to shop."}
{"text":"My normal Panda experience - half fried rice half steamed, orange chicken - Beijing beef / green tea. Everything was fresh and good - the place was clean and there was four other tables of folk's eating. Uneventful, good meal YaY"}
{"text":"The service here was excellent!  I was given very full portions and the service was very fast and friendly.  The food was pretty good and the price was reasonable.  Ofelia helped me and was very helpful and accomodating and fixed any issues that I had immediately."}
{"text":"Always friendly and have my orders accurate. Had to wait one time for fresh teriyaki chicken and was offered free egg rolls and rangoons as we waited."}
{"text":"Very rude and careless staff. Waited 20 minutes teriyaki chicken to be cooked. THEN, fifteen more minutes for the teriyaki sauce. Staff members were very rude and when I asked how long the sauce would be they said \"well I don't know I'm not the one making it.\" My food was cold by the time I received it. Definitely save your money and go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Hoped my order would be good after waiting 25 minutes in the drive-through. Just bit into a crunchy burnt piece of something disgusting... I hope it was chicken if not I'm really scared. Won't be back."}
{"text":"After waiting for 10 minutes for good, 75% of my chicken entre was vegetables. And upon arriving home, we realized they forget all or the sauces for our teriyaki chicken.   Update: my boyfriend just found a sharp chicken bone in his teriyaki!"}
{"text":"Want to like it but just can't handle the drive through or carry out experience. Seems like they would do better to keep all the prepared food  in one spot to better indicate whether you're going get food quickly or have to wait 5, 10 or 15 minutes for it. Having \"two kitchens\" is en vogue to tell investors how you're going to handle higher volumes for web order/ drive through but it's a failure here.   Have given them several tries hoping it was growing pains but this last time they shorted me on half my order - only giving me the plate that was out. Shame one me for not checking before I left but this is the 4th or 5th disappointing experience too many.   Regarding the food...it's decent fast casual Ameri-Chinese style.  Can get some healthy, tasty options. Really like a place serving steamed mixed veggies as a side but sometimes they are not even cooked."}
{"text":"The absolute worst experience ever!  They gave me the wrong food which I realized when I got back to my office.  When I returned they acted like they did not care and continued to help other customers while ignoring me for 10 minutes ... wow!  Never eating there again!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a bite to eat before the movie. Typical Panda Express + free wifi."}
{"text":"Very nice.  I usually avoid buffet style Asian fast food, but I'm not sure if all Panda Express locations are the same, was pleased to see all the fresh veggies showcased in their fridge,  they had some unique offerings,  like the walnut honey shrimp,  a little more expensive but good!  They offered me free samples right away, and although there power went down a few minutes before I got there, they were still on top of their game. Clean, cool, and nice inside. Good music. I'd say,  you can't go wrong eating there.  The food looked fresh,  and there were a lot of people eating,  but no waiting time."}
{"text":"I went there a few times. I decided not to return when the staff gave me the wrong order, which I noticed when I arrived at home and had to drive all the way back to get my correct order. They just gave me the right order. I would have expected at least a free drink or dessert or something... Can't beat Li's Bowl."}
{"text":"I've had mostly good experiences here, but tonight at the drive-thru was ridiculous. I'm a very patient person but I almost lost it with, Veronica, who is supposedly, assistant manager.  I ordered a bowl and wanted to pay with a remaining gift card balance. She told me the card wasn't reading. Ok.  She tried covering it in plastic and told me that wasn't working and that's what they do when cards don't work. I know this. I used to work a cash register. Fix it and get me my food. It's already been 7 minutes.  I told her type it in. She tells me she can't. I said again, type it in. Again she says she cannot. I ask for a manager because clearly she is incompetent. She informs me she is the one in charge. WOW! I'm amazed. Shocked.   She then tells me she is going to another register. She finally comes back and tells me she typed it in. Way to go!   I'm truly appalled people like this have jobs and think they can demand 15/hr.   Veronica and the other employees at this place need some training. I'm sorry to go off like this, but people like that shouldn't be in charge."}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express ever! I eat at Panda Express a lot, and this one is closest to my home. I once again made the huge mistake of trying this location again. There is almost always a dirty smelly bum right outside the door asking for a handout, like there was tonight. They NEVER have any vegetables ready, so they cook them too fast (i.e. undercook) if you order any. I asked them about this, and they said I could call ahead to have them ready. Well, even when I do that, they don't get them started until I show up. What's the use of calling ahead? I hope the store owner sees this review. It lists the reasons we drive a little further to enjoy how this restaurant chain is supposed to be."}
{"text":"A lot of unfriendly counter personnel not really doing anything. There was a mid-afternoon rush when I stopped in for a quick bite, but the only one's really working were the poor cooks slinging it out non stop. The rest of the people were not very effective and didn't seem to know what to do when it's busy. I got charged twice the amount my combo should have been and prices were ridiculously high for mediocre fast food."}
{"text":"Starving? Sure Price? $12 include drink Food quality? Bland  Im asian so I know good chinese food. For some reason, everyone else thinks this kind of chinese food is delicious. Sure i eat panda a few times in vegas and only reason is i was starving or had no choice cause buddies choose this place.   The food itself is so plain. Do they not know what salt is? They use the lightest soy sauce possible that doesnt even have a bit of taste.   I'll eat again if im drunk or need a quick bite.   You will feel hungry again after an hour or 2."}
{"text":"I like the food but the cashier was just rude she put orange chicken in my plate when I told her teriyaki chicken and I told her and she gave me attitude I also asked for a small drink and she charged me for a large"}
{"text":"They literally forgot to give me the side dish! Smh! I would not recommend getting food from them ever again."}
{"text":"Extra star for the Corporate follow up but nothing more because I still want this location to be held accountable for their staff.   Plenty of Panda Franchise locations, spend your money elsewhere!! Support another local Franchise instead."}
{"text":"Okay, 4 stars. That was underrated. We visit this location often and now we've started ordering party trays of teriyaki chicken. The food is always fresh & the staff at this location is always so sweet.   1-8-17 Shera I believe & the manager on staff at 3:30pm were particularly extra nice today. They're part of the reason we keep coming back to this location. They have a great balance of speed & service.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Craved Panda and really like this location as it's in a not-so-crowded area. Quick, clean, and friendly I am in -- get my food and sitting outdoors in their outdoor seats in no time. My favorite is the Beijing beef with half white steamed rice and half friend rice and a side of vegetables. Yum."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and ordered a beef broccoli bowl w fried rice.  And this is how much meat they gave me.  One piece of beef that's been shredded into 6 smaller pieces!!!Then when I drove all the way back to talk to the manager Murray. He only offered to give me a replacement meal and absolutely no accommodations for the inconvenience of driving all the way back for the meal that I already paid for. I will never go back to this pathetic excuse for a panda express ever again!!!"}
{"text":"I am a Chinese American and I totally realize that Panda Express is not really true Chinese cuisine but Panda Express is tasty! The true test is that my born-and-bred Chinese mom loves to come here. This location is close to ASU. With these kind of stores, a location where there are lots of customers all day means the food doesn't sit out for a long time. It is true that there are times when I have to wait a couple of min for them to make an item they ran out of. This locations gets so many orders the food is constantly being made \"fresh\" all the time, and I have come here all times of the day, even right before they close.  I always get their mixed veggies as my entree but their noodles are good sometimes they tempt me to eat them. They have all the normal items. I don't eat the super breaded options like orange chicken or Beijing beef so I can't comment on those items. But their green bean chicken, Kung pao, and broccoli cans beef are good. I like when I get broccoli and beef that I actually get beef. There are some Panda locations where what you get is broccoli with a couple slivers of beef. Not here!   The other thing I like that they are aware of customers in line. Even when the line is long, they are pretty quick.  The drive thru does seem to be really slow so I always park and go into the store as it seems faster. Additionally the store is always very clean, which does factor into things when I am eating.  I have also tried their \"catering\" option.  I ordered the mixed veggies and noodles as a large portion for potlucks and they are generous for only being about $10. It is a good solution when you have a bunch of hungry kids!  I call in about 15-20 min before and it has always been ready to pick up when I get there.  Overall, one of the nicest Panda Express in the area. Whoever owns this franchise location knows what they are doing! If you are looking for a quick, yummy meal with no fuss and hassle, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and was the only one in there bedsides the 5 employees, not only did I wait a few minutes to get any service the lady who made my plate walked away and had a lady who was cleaning come back around the counter to ring me out, I was clearly in a hurry and they both displayed no respect for my time or sense of urgency for theres! Not only was the service poor but all my food tasted burnt and when I tried to call I got no answer not sure whos in charge her but please check the cameras!"}
{"text":"Poorly run. Minimum wage goes up, and service goes down. The workers serving the food don't order when they see they're running low. Bottom line? Your food stays out until food comes up. Very poor planning for a simple job! Not difficult to see if you're running out of what I now call KUNG PAO VEGETABLES, because there's hardly any chicken in it, that you don't order more. Especially when the line is out the door! I will never return."}
{"text":"Went in today to give it another opportunity. At 1210 almost half dishes were empty. Was told they could make me food but would take 15 minutes.  Quite frankly there is better Chinese food out there. Ads vantage of Panda is supposed to be quick service.  Guy said they just opened at 11 so it takes them awhile to get setup.  Really lunch time and u don't bother cooking."}
{"text":"We were pretty excited to see Panda Express had opened up. We checked out the menu before we went to make certain my husband could eat the food. So off we go!! The food was horrible!!! The fried rice was so very bland, the orange chicken tasted like chicken mcnuggets dipped in sauce, the General Tso's chicken was slimy!! We had the egg roll ( do not get them) They had a weird smell and when tasted,,,they tasted like they smelled! The best part of our meal was the fortune cookies!! We will not be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here at 8:31 and their doors are locked!!!!!! Don't listen to the times posted online...they are incorrect!!!!"}
{"text":"Long wait, bad noodle, not worth it.Dat orange chicken be hot!!! Review by my good loking son (reviews made by 13 year old not to take seriously) ??????????¤¤¤.º:-D:-):'(:-(:-D:-)"}
{"text":"I get that this place is a busy location but Jesus Christ, how hard is it to not get an order mixed up. If everything I say is correct on the screen, I don't know why I would be handed anything different. I wouldn't be upset if I didn't have to wait 25 minutes for my food in the drive through. This is the third time it has happened and the last time I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I arrived 40 minutes before closing and they were out of chow mein and they advised that the kitchen was closed down. They did not offer to make any as other locations do. My dinner guest and I ordered from what they had and sat down. We watched at least three other people come in and leave without making a purchase. Despite losing potential customers, a worker approached us with some chow mein they had made for another customer after us...a nice gesture to turn the tide of our visit. Customers after this continued to order chow mein and sales were lost due to not offering to make a customers order. Nearly 10 customers didn't buy anything due to unavailability. Stereo speakers need changed."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this ever again. The staff were very rude and the food tasted like it was made in a garbage can from old scraps. The Charming waa very dry and had no flavor, the orange chicken was also dry chewy and tasted old. The egg rolls tasted like onion only. This was the second time we have had an issue at this location. We were given 2 free meal coupons to replace our last meal for our next visit. When I presented them Jean and she very rudely told me I could only use one of them i explained what happened and she said again you can only use 1 you can call the number on the back of you receipt if you have a problem that was after asking for the manager."}
{"text":"Well what can I say about Panda? If you discount the greasiness of the food and the lack of authenticity of the \"Chinese\" it is trying to replicate, you get a very very good fast food meal. That being said it all depends on whether you are in the mood for fast food (thus expect grease) and/or authentic Chinese food.  Evaluating the place as a whole from the fast food perspective, it is very tasty, tons of different options at a decent price for the amount of food you get, so this category is very competitive.  I would recommend the pork eggrolls, not the spring rolls, as they are very good."}
{"text":"Good food great customer service they had the craziest customer today that took 40 minutes To make a order to go.She was absolutely crazy and being very difficult and the staff handled it very good !!!!"}
{"text":"Quick. Customizable. Affordable. That's what you can expect when you go to eat at Panda Express. Since I'm a visual person, particularly with my food, it's nice to have a wide array of dishes to choose from readily available and freshly wok'd. The sweet fire chicken is a hearty choice with balanced flavor - the pineapple chunks offer sweet notes and a glaze over the crispy breaded white meat chicken that delicately cuts through just enough of the bell pepper and spice. If you're opting for a lighter dish try their chicken and greenbean entrée which is less caloric yet satisfying."}
{"text":"My husband and I normally like panda on our \"lazy nights\" but this panda has ruined it for me. The past few times we have gone the food is soggy like it has been sitting there. We gave it a few chances hoping it was just that time but it has happened a few times in a row.... only got 2 stars because NORMALLY the customer service is satisfactory."}
{"text":"I'm struggling to give this particular Panda Express a 3 star. There is no consistency when it comes to food quality, care of customer, or the staff.  There are times I love coming in. Greeted in a friendly manner, the food portions and quality I expect, and I can be in and out. Other times, the lady at the front can be extremely rude, including getting mad at my friend because he  asked her for a different item then he just said (the usual, changed mind before she even plated the food).  I've gone there to have varying portion sizes, majority too small from other Panda Expresses, cold, dry food, and sometimes burnt!  Until quality hits some consistency, I would say find another store to go to."}
{"text":"Last night I witness a line cook pull out a white bucket across the floor then sniff with his nose the bucket lid as he took it off before balancing the bucket lid on the lip of the trash can. The line cook then poured the brown sauce into a metal pot that was on the floor before placing the mental pot at the cooking station. As the line cook placed the metal pot at the cooking station the white bucket lid that was balancing on the lip of the trash can fell into the trash. The line cook retrieves the bucket lid that was inside the large trash can to place it back on the white bucket.  GROSS!!! THIS IS CLEARLY A HUGE FOOD HANDLING VIOLATION THAT I WILL BE REPORTING"}
{"text":"This Panda location has a drive thru. Beware of extremely long lines during lunch time at an establishment that is sooooo understaff. I thought I could make it in and out by going in but that was just as bad.  I can say the manager was very friendly and patient. Considering the fact that he had to manage as well as serve he is a true manager who really works hard. The food was tasty and flowed with the presentation. Hot food that is overall good food. The service at the register was not friendly with a smile. You can tell an employee oh likes there job with an employee who is catching a paycheck.  I will be back but I will come during a slower time of day. Lunch time is a zoo.   Some Perks on this place: This establishment is super clean.  Plenty of condiments neatly organized. Plenty of parking"}
{"text":"They no longer carry the blackberry tea. Would like to see it come back, it was refreshing on a hot day."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price. We always get the Kung-Pao Chicken, Orange chicken nuggets.  Fast easy meal. Can be healthy especially if you order 1/2 vegetable with 1/2 fried rice or noodles. Yum Yum"}
{"text":"I love Panda Express, its so tasty and profeciently prepared :) I stick to the easy stuff, a little fried rice, some orange chicken and Beijing beef. The rice was. Really good, not sticky or too chewy. Thr orange chicken was juicy and not too tart. The beef... yeah don't get the beef. It was soggy or something. Not good at all.  Prices are what they are at every other panda location. For some strange reason this store always seems to have some shaddy looking characters wondering around it. I can't help but to stare at my car the entire time I'm there just to make sure its still there. If your in a jam, happen to be in the area and want some decent grub then go for it. Otherwise keep driving south and hit up the Panda on Sunset and Sandhill its a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Min is the best!!!! He is always so pleasant even when the customers are complete assholes! Love this guy. By far the best panda employee im ever met."}
{"text":"Hubs and I ate here alot when we first moved to vegas since it was just down the road from our hotel. We never got tired of it. Food was actually pretty good. Staff are always nice so thats a plus."}
{"text":"This is the last time that I am going to Panda Express. I don't know who there owners or managers are but they have really cut corners on their quality. When they opened up they were delicious for the first month and then after that the quality of the food sucks. The rice is never cooked enough. It is crunchy bits of sadness and there is not flavor. Just undercooked rice and not barely cooked vegetables. I would understand that happening once, but I have been there a bunch because I thought it would get better and it did not. Then today I ordered the chow mein and to switch it up and sure as shit. The chow mein was undercooked and super chewy. This is sad because I normally love Panda Express but the poor management is showing in the food. Also 1.50 extra for the walnut shrimp and they barely give you 4 pieces of shrimp.... Rip off. Do not go there."}
{"text":"This store is a 100% Customer Service. No matter how close to closing they take care of me with 100% awesome service & great food. I go out of my way coming to this location since they always take care of me!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went in at 8:55 tonight. They had no food so my husband ordered chicken & mushroom. The manager asked for an order & the cook who was already cleaning the grill told her the kitchen was closed. They close at 9:30! My husband tol the manager how can they not have food when they close in 35 minutes. The manager had the audacity to walk away & had a regular worker ask my husband if he wanted old veggies, very little fried rice, one serving of orange chicken of old honey shrimp. My husband was disgusted and walked out. This is the second time this has happened at this location. Horrible customer service & we won't be back. Disgusted! I received a response who asked me to DM my address yet, there is nowhere to DM. More frustrated!"}
{"text":"Employees a few years ago were wonderful, friendly.  Staff has changed and the new manager was extremely rude.  Went back a few weeks ago and seems like things have turned around (thank goodness this is very close to my house).  Managers are wonderful and the staff great now."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I just waited in the drive thru line for 20 minutes. I ordered one plate and 1 kids meal but when I tried to choose the entree for the kids meal the young lady at the window said you're confusing me. She then asked so are you wanting an entree plate or a kids meal? I replied that I wanted both. She then added up my entire total and said to proceed to the window. When I finally reached the window, she gave me a total for only the entree plate. I proceeded to ask about the kids meal and the drinks that I had ordered and she stated you wanted those too? She seemed so annoying to have to go back and fill a kid's meal plate and fill up two drinks even though she screwed up on taking the order. I will never go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"We have always had pleasant people that work there, food is always been spot on. Easy location with drive thru makes it even more accessible."}
{"text":"Quick service. When they're out of something they're fast to fix it. Appreciate the military discount,and the store is clean."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I keep trying this location... servings get smaller and smaller, prices increase and quality is subpar... Selections often out... Manager Narine appears to not care at all - what happened to customer service? I'd recommend trying a different location."}
{"text":"I don't like Panda Express usually. But this place is so good. The food is cooked so well and everything is hot and delicious ..  The people who work here give very generous portions and don't try to skim you.  Customer service is standard here just polite and move you along. Not a bad thing since I'm not a very chatty person. I'm always in a rush to get from place to place .   Great food. Fresh food and a clean area to sit and eat"}
{"text":"It's panda, quick, consistent, decent \"Chinese\" food."}
{"text":"Nobody thinks Panda Express is authentic or gourmet.  But my husband is a big fan of their orange chicken and fried rice, and after being a frequent customer back in my college days, it has some nostalgia for me.  Fast food shrimp is often sketchy, but the Pacific Chili Shrimp is surprisingly good.  Service is fast, the restaurant itself is pretty clean, and prices are reasonable.  Nothing fancy, but if what you're looking for is Chinese in a hurry, Panda Express does the trick."}
{"text":"To have 7 people on shift and have them operate so slow is unacceptable I literally had to tell the cashier to finish my order before going to a new customer. Would never come to this location again. When there's other locations that are much faster and operate at a better pace. It wasn't even that busy to have to wait almost 20 mins to order"}
{"text":"As much as we frequent this Panda Express it has taken a nose dive. The manager made my order she was in such a hurry everything was tossed together. And her portions were not consistent. My daughters food was missing the orange chicken. Not driving all the way back so they can make it right. Next time  we'll go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Panda Express, THE place for Chinese Food! Huge variety to choose from. And Orange Chicken, OMG, the taste is just awesome. Prices are just right and the portions are big. Try the noodles, fried rice and the beef. What a taste!   This particular outlets has its own lot with private parking at the corner of Broadway & Rural. New building too.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food always. I wish the staff was a little more friendly and I really wish the portion sizes were a little bigger. I end up ordering a 3 item entree to fill up. Very good food though!"}
{"text":"The worst Panda Express ever. I got food poisoning from this panda. I felt like I had to throw up and shit at the same time, same thing happened to my sister. This panda was just a bunch a younger people talking about how they are off on the thirty min..... well they sure acted like they were already off work, they ran out of entrees and didn't start preparing them till about five minutes after they noticed they had to make more. Also this one time I went through the drive thru and I was ordering my food and the young man closed the window when I was still talking to him. Like I said worst Panda Express ever."}
{"text":"Tried to pick up a quick meal on the way from the Railway and have a picnic at the park.  Sadly the honey walnut shrimp was soggy and the shrimp meat was tough and chewy especially at the tail ends.  They served us the brown fried rice (yeck!) instead of white fried rice.  Ate half of it hoping it was just a few bad pieces, nope it just got worse.  Next day I had the bad food stomach botulism hangover.  My girls orange chicken looked like it fresh enough.  Never realized how to appreciate the Las Vegas fast food until I ordered shrimp in a small town where they probably don't like seafood in general or they just can't fathom spending another buck on it.  Still love you Boulder City but fcuk this Panda yo."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Went through the drive-thru, checked my receipt and everything I asked for was on it. When I got home, they messed up not only one but two of my orders.  Clearly asked for chow mein/fried rice and got double fried rice. On the other plate I asked for orange chicken and teriyaki and I only got one side filled with teriyaki... never coming to this location again!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Line almost out the door and never managed to go down. 3 servers and all were completely unorganized. Finally got to check out and they almost gave our order, that we had to wait extra for since the main entrees weren't ready, to someone else. Lots of items were out and the sauces looked likes they've been sitting out for a while. Not coming to this location again."}
{"text":"The manager here is incompetent and unfriendly. It's close to my house, so I have gone to this location many times. Every time is the same story as you will read in all the other reviews below. She doesn't replenish food till it is out and then ordered by a customer. So you either have to wait way too long or you get the scraping from the bottom of the bowl and get shorted because they don't have enough. What kind of Panda runs out of fried rice and chow mein? Every time I go, one is out and everyone is waiting. This manager needs to be fired. I could go on, but you get the point. I am fed up with this location and will drive farther the next time I get Panda."}
{"text":"Everyone was very polite and greeted me with a smile Jazmine the cashier Had an awesome customer service attitude she was the best the manager was there to daniel I think I seen his name was very nice and respectful this store is highly recommended to all my friends and family"}
{"text":"I regretted eating this about 5 bites in.  Barely ate much.  Never eaten at one before, and never will again.  I felt tired and gross the rest of the day. Probably lots of msg, preservatives and junk. Dry fried rice, fatty chicken and.... I just can't chat about it any longer.  Bad choice of place.  I was super hungry."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the one closest to me, so after work we decided to drop by and get some dinner for the family. We checked online to see their closing hours and we have fifty minutes until they closed. When we arrived they still have thirty minutes left to close and people still inside eating. As soon as we opened the door and were about to approach the food the workers began angrily yelling at us that they were closing and to go through the drive-thru instead, not the main entrance.   We were already there so we went through the drive-thru and they ended up not getting our order correct and they were out of nearly everything and wouldn't make more. I have ate there before and they were quite nice, the customer service was excellent, and they had been pretty fast. I really don't understand why this past experience was so horrible, but I don't think I'll be visiting any time soon."}
{"text":"I come here all the time because it's close to my office. I use the drive thru, and they almost always get my order wrong. I only order 2 plates. Today Saturday, October 21st, the same thing happened. I really don't want to say the name of the female employee that treated me rudely. I checked my food because the same girl has given me wrong food before. The teriyaki chicken was very undercooked, never like before, I asked if she can grill it some more or just give me chicken with at least some grill marks. She sighed and threw the food in the trash. I even asked her if she's ok, and I asked for the manager and she said she wasn't there. Then 10 seconds later another employee asked if everything was ok. I briefly told her what had happened and just decided to ask for corporate's phone number.   I hate to complain, especially because I come here for lunch quite often and the employees are cool. Except for this one particular employee that begins with the letter C. I strongly believe that customer service and compassion is very important when dealing with the public. Doesn't matter what you do or where you work. Always treat people with respect, especially paying customers.   I give this place 2 stars because of all the times I had to drive back from work to return my wrong order. Such a waste of food.  Now, I always check my order before I drive off.   Thank you very much for your time."}
{"text":"Never have had a bad experience here. Good customer service, foods fresh and hot. Great to sit outside on a nice day to enjoy lunch/dinner, like today :)"}
{"text":"I decided to write this review whilst sitting in the drive thru, because it's now been pushing 15 minutes waiting in line and I have not moved, nor has anyone in front of me. I can't back out because someone is behind me. I could have driven to the Panda in Goodyear and have made it back home by now. Save your time, go someone else."}
{"text":"Website says they open at 9:30, drove all the way over here to find out they open at 10. Cashiers are very unpleasant would not recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Came here with my my wife the other day and the food was great! The fried rice with veggies was great. I went to this place a lot in california and it never disappointed in terms of quality and freshness."}
{"text":"I came in 30 mins from closing and everything was fresh and hot. They made me mixed veggies because they were out. The ladies here were nicer than any other location. We frequent panda every few weeks, because it's easy for the whole family. This is one of the nicer, newer locations and the food is better here than most."}
{"text":"This location has gone seriously downhill throughout the years. Sad, because the inside just got a facelift. Their vegetables (which I always get at Panda Express) are always soggy, thick, and gross. Their chicken is slimey. Most dishes look like they've been sitting for a long time and their staff is completely miserable. The one at Mesa riverview is so much better!!!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst drive through of any place I have ever been to.... there is only 3 cars ahead of me and I've been sitting here for 20 minutes. Haven't even ordered. If a car wasn't behind me I would have left 10 minutes ago. Never again. If you're in a hurry there's a McDonalds next door."}
{"text":"My food was hot and I did not have to wait long for my order. The pepper chicken and orange chicken was better at this location, then the others I have visited. I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Always clean, always fresh, or maybe my timing is always awesome. Also, they are very quick to get you through the line, even at lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Portions look smaller now with the new carry out plate. I ordered orange chicken and there's only 3 pieces of orange chicken in my plate. They had ran out of beef and broccoli. They also didn't have Pepsi. Horrible service."}
{"text":"I've been back a handful of times since my review and I felt the need to update it.  - Service has almost always been very nice and friendly. Smiling faces from the moment you enter until you leave.  - They have not been stingy with the portions. This is huge for me. For other places I've been to in the area it has been a deal breaker. (*cough*KFC*cough) - prices are fair for what you get...especially since they aren't cheap with the portions!  This place is back on my radar. I will be back!  3 solid stars and rising...  A-Ok!"}
{"text":"Really, what is there to say? It's a standard Panda Express location that can be found on the southeast corner of Silverado Ranch Blvd and Maryland Parkway.   My strategy with Panda is to try to hit it in the first hour of opening, if I can. That way the food is always fresh. If you wait till later in the day it seems as though you are really rolling the dice.   I do like the pepper chicken, orange chicken, and just about any of the shrimp offerings!  This location is kept very clean and has always maintained an appealing appearance.  Service is also a crap shoot. I've gotten some nice and friendly service here at times. On the flip side, I've had some employees become irrationally impatient and rush myself(and witnessed others) through the ordering process, even when it's not busy.  All in all, its okay. I stop by about once a month or so.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Panda Express location located on Blue Diamond Road, about halfway between Arville and Decatur. It's best to pull in on Cameron for quick and easy access to this location.  This is a pretty standard, run of the mill Panda....with one big difference...a drive thru! I had never been to a Panda with a drive thru before finding this spot! I've only been thru a couple of times at this point, but so far I've only had good experiences thru the drive thru here.  The restaurant is clean inside and I've always gotten good service from the staff inside. Portion sizes were ok. Just ok. Not too chintzy and certainly not too generous. I wish there was more that I could report that made it stand out more than any other Panda I've ever been to ...but...yea...  ...drive thru...check..  That about covers it.  It's still A-OK!  3 stars."}
{"text":"The employees are usually nice. However, the drive thru is extremely slow. The will give you 100 free small waters, but charge you for 1 medium water. Dumbest thing ever. This place def needs new management and the employees need to be retrained"}
{"text":"What part of Two items do they NOT! Understand. First girl screw up. Then cashier say what one don't you want. I said the extra item. I only asked for two items. Seriously Dumb and Dumber were clearly hired there. They complain they want 15$ an hour but Don't! Listen to the customer. Then  you call them out on the Upsale Theft.. they look at you like Deer in the headlights. Save your time and money Go to Teriyaki Madness on power and southern. Good food good customer service. This place sucked. If i could give it NO stars i would."}
{"text":"I frequently come to this Panda on Watson minimum once a week by drive thru but after today they have lost my business. Their drive thru service is unfriendly and serving portions have gotten smaller and smaller, no longer filling. My rice has had some hard rice grains lately. I'm done , no longer going back."}
{"text":"Nothing that great about the Panda Express here. I usually order Beijing beef and it was soggy and not as crispy. My husband's walnut shrimp was soggy also. Not sure if i wanna come back here. At least they gave out complimentary cups for water...hehe. Happy eats!!!"}
{"text":"4/26/18 It was getting late. Family was hungry from moving furnitures back and forth to our new home. We ordered the family meal which came with 3 large side entree, 2 carbs ( choice of chow mein, chow fun, white or brown rice, or steamed vegetables. It fed our family of 5 and we still had leftovers. Another quick stop for dinner. Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"I truly wish I could give a -10000 stars for their terrible service. The 3 star food is alright for the price. They ASKED you to donate money to MAKE THEMSELVES RICHER!!! DO NOT DONATE MONEY! There is NO Report on the percentage of your money going to the children. They probably get hundred of millions of dollars since the start but only gave a tiny fraction of that amount."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express, and you better believe it's good coming from a Chinese girl . Sure Panda Express is Americanized Chinese fast food, but it's cheap and tasty. I love their orange chicken, broccoli beef and teriyaki chicken. I prefer Panda Express over PeiWei, even though PeiWei is closer to my house. I don't get why this Panda has only 1.5 stars, it's a fast food joint, so what do you expect? Michelin 3 stars? Whenever I'm at this Panda Express, there is usually no line and if I order something they are out they are fast about it. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food was average and the place is nicely decorated.   Whoever reads these or manages the store needs to realize the asset they have in their employ Dominic. He greeted us, was courteous and even casually up sold us: \"Would you guy like a side order for only a dollar more?\" And \"can I add a medium drink for a dollar more\"  After Dominic took our order he swept and cleaned the place. He needs to be recognized as an amazing employee."}
{"text":"Went here because it's close by and I wanted quick chinese food. It was barely okay. The environment was not great and the staff was not very friendly.  Upon entry there was no greeting and there was not a single person smiling except the cashier.   The reason for two stars and not one is because it did the job and maybe they were just having a bad day; however, personally I don't think I'll be going back to this location. Nor would I recommend anyone come here."}
{"text":"When we walked into the place we gave it 5 stars the food looked really good at first. We ordered 3 entrys plus one side meal each and everything was great until we began to eat. The food was cold as an Eskimos nipple. And soggy like a wet sock. I bit into a price of spicy chicken and nearly broke my tooth on some kind of mysterious object. Still unknown. May have been a beak or someone else's tooth perhaps? At this point they lost 3 stars. I noticed a digital sign for the spicy shrimp on the wall and it said \"get it while it's hot!\" I then wondered at what time they were referring too? Yesterday maybe? I went up to the counter and asked a employee for salt and pepper. He handed e me pepper but had trouble understanding what the salt was at which point he handed me the entire bin for me to retrieve the salt myself. At this point they lost another star. As I was attempting to not to look at my food I noticed the ceiling had several leak stains and a rather large puddle on the kitchen floor. Overall it was a very disturbing experience and if I could give them no stars I would. On the way out there was no handle on the door. Hmmm? Not sure why. Maybe so there customer's can not escape. I managed to get out though. Thank God. Not to mention the horrible diarrhea that occurred later that evening which may I add  clogged the toilet well at lease the food was finally hot enter at own risk and god speed."}
{"text":"I visited this location on Sunday, October 1st after making a mobile order. Normally with a mobile order one would assume that their order would be ready for pickup at the given time. This was not the case. When I arrived only 1 minute past my given pickup time I stood at the online pickup area. My order was not ready so I proceeded to wait an additional ten minutes while my order was made in line with the in store customers. The person I assume was the manager, Juan, only offered a sorry and went back to frying vegetables. My order consisted of mixed veggies (which needed up only being broccoli and squash) and dry chow mein. (they gave me \"extra\" because they weren't serving spring rolls that I somehow was able to add to my order on the app) my husband and I were given drinks on the house for our trouble. We wanted to eat outside on the patio but unfortunately the utensil bar was not stocked (mind you there were at least 7 employees and light traffic in the drive thru) after taking our food home my husband noticed (the icing on top of this formidable visit) a hair in his chicken. I believe it's safe to say that although at face value this location is fresh and new. It definitely need a new management strategy."}
{"text":"Great service. Cleaned table for us. Prompt. Gave samples. Food was about as good as fast food gets."}
{"text":"Love the \"Order Online!\" Walked in, saw huge line... Not a problem!  We have  ordered online several times now, the food is always ready, still hot when I get home and the best part,no waiting. They've done a great job with zero mistakes so far!  Did I mention the food is good?  I am not looking for a 5 Star meal or I wouldn't be going to Panda.  The only people I see upset are those waiting in line."}
{"text":"Had to wait for a few entrees to cook but they apologized and gave me a small entree for my wait which was super cool since I didn't even complain about the wait :)"}
{"text":"This location the last 3 times has been pretty freaking slow, and today I came in at 2:30 and they were out of 4 entrees completely but only had one cool back there making food and he wasn't really doing anything, as I needed some black pepper chicken hey didn't start even making it till I asked for it, and then I waited 10 mins as they made it and when it was done asked for teriyaki sauce and they didn't have any, they hadn't had any for the 10 mins I was waiting for the other entree but decided to make it only when I asked for it. If that's how things run here then I may not be coming back to this location which sucks because it's the closest one to me most of the time. It took 5 mins to make teriyaki sauce"}
{"text":"Terrible!!  They are super crowded and will never take the order right. Please check the bag before you go."}
{"text":"As I was in line there was a family in front of me. The cashier was ringing them up, a 2nd cashier opened and rang up the person behind us, then would have rang up the next person behind me if I had not brought up that I wasn't with the people in front of me. They had assumed that we were with the family up front. We also ordered a passion fruit \"fruit tea\". We were told that there would be a 3 minute wait. I said ok as we were going to eat in the food court while waiting anyway. We had already finished eating when I checked to see what had happened to my drink. They never started making it, so I had to wait again after waiting an initial amount of time."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express. I always go here, it's so good! I recommend the orange chicken and fried rice and potstickers!"}
{"text":"In a word: slow. I'm a big fan of panda express. But the two times I have come to this location the service was so slow. I won't be back to this location because I simply don't have time to wait in line as long as I have to to get my meal."}
{"text":"Ordered the wok seared steak and shrimp and my meal didn't even have one shrimp. The steak and veggies were very tasty but I was very disappointed to not have one shrimp in my meal.  I love that brown rice is offered as a side. So Panda where's the shrimp?"}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean and friendly. We had a few minutes before we had to pick up my son and thought if the line wasn't long panda sounded awesome. Panda is what panda is and I for one enjoy it! But what was extra special was clarissa (from receipt). Smiley,friendly and made sure we ordered what we wanted. We were in and out and still had time to sit in car and eat before pick up. Thanks for not letting us down."}
{"text":"I used to occasionally dine at Panda Express when I wanted a cheap meal and to just kick back and chill. The problem is that the food seems to sit out there for a long period of time; or they would spoon out the last batch to me sans most of the chicken. In other words, their portion ratio of meat to vegetables is never consistent."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood Panda Express.  Always friendly and happy to see us.  Great customer service and quality food."}
{"text":"11/13/16 I placed an online order. Went to pick it up and food was ready on time no wait. Once I arrived home, the food was luke warm, but no worries. The lo mein was dry as hell.  The green beans were good until I found a blond hair in my food! There goes my appetite! Never again!!! I get it hair sheds and that is why they make hair nets!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered bejing beef and it was so undercooked that the batter on the outside was soggy. When I took it in to get something else I was treated like crap by staff and management. I tried to be nice but was still treated like I was to blame. I will NEVER return. Left with more uncooked food (orange chicken) while getting dirty looks."}
{"text":"Omg.... I just left this location, had 2 plates to-go and the server \"Precious\" was a little bit unfocused. I had to repeat my order to her and she still didn't give me the sauce on the side. That was minor though, the food is what really disappointed me. The food presentation was good, however when I got it home... I noticed the rice was different from what I am used too and it had no flavor. It looked like white rice with carrots and corn and soy sauce in it. Not good! And the food was cold! They may need to turn up the heat on their steam table.... I'm sure it wouldn't pass Health Dept Code for standard temperature. Sorry, but I won't be returning to that location again."}
{"text":"Three stars because im drunk and yelp says \"A-ok\" which is funny to me and realistic because its A-OK!  Mainly because if your drinking and you have a designated driver Panda is great, otherwise your obese and have problem with blatter control! BAM I SAID IT!  And these bastards shut down Chop-Chop which was still crap but slightly better but either way this food is what is making us obese because apparently parents let kids eat anything, which is why I was fat, thanks mom, F u fast food. . . yeah ill have some crab puffs"}
{"text":"It's fast, their friendly, it's cheap and it can be healthy if you order the right thing. I tried the new Garlic Garlic Chicken, did I mention the Garlic?  It was good and a better choice than anything fried.  White chicken, veggies and a dark garlic sauce on steamed white rice, somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"Found a toothpick in my food. Just an FYI for anyone deciding to visit this establishment. That could have hurt!"}
{"text":"I feel like a squeaky wheel sometimes but here I go. Nothing like spending 40 bucks at Panda Express to find a black hair in my food. Totally disgusting. I don't want a response from Panda Express telling me that they care and want to make it right because it's too late; I will never return."}
{"text":"Food was bland. I ordered online to pick up in store and got there three minutes earlier than pick up time and they had yet to print and start my order. Drive home (20 minutes away) and instead of beef and broccoli I was just given broccoli. Will not return."}
{"text":"Over 20 minute wait with only 3 cars in drive thru! It took 15 minutes just to place my order, mind you I was sitting by the speaker for those 15 minutes because the other 2 cars had already placed their orders. Couldn't back up cause there were cars in back of me, (most of which backed out after ten minutes). No apologies or explanations given by staff. Just luke warn chow mein and even colder service. Do yourself a favor and go to the Rancho location. I've literally never had to wait over twenty minutes for drive thru fast food! Abysmal!"}
{"text":"This is always a good place to swing into when I am in a hurry! The staff is so friendly, the food is decent for basically \"fast food\"  And I think it is cute that they will let you taste stuff before you decide, although I rarely take them up on it."}
{"text":"Orange Breading Nuggets? I am angry! We are very sad that future trips to Panda Express may not be happening for us. I don't think it's a particular franchise issue; I think it's a company issue, as our recent experience at several Panda Express restaurants, including out of state, is that the food quality has declined in the Orange Chicken.   This has always been my 12 year old son's FAVORITE food of all time and even he wouldn't eat his dinner last night. We order the Family Feast with two of the three entree choices being the Orange Chicken. We've done this every time for the last 5 years. For about the past year, only about half of the nuggets per container actually contain chicken. The rest is just breading.   I will be returning my full container of orange-sauce-covered-breading back to Panda tomorrow. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. If the quality improves in the future, we'll be happy to return, but until then, Bye Bye Panda. :("}
{"text":"Can't say I LOVE the food, but they have some good healthy options when you're in a hurry and the service at this location is always fantastic."}
{"text":"If I could  I w'd give it a zero, if you want to eat in a dirty place manage by rude, and INDOLENT kids go there."}
{"text":"Great people working there but it's the dirtiest Panda I have ever been to.....every single table is dirty and disgusting. Here is the kicker there is no one in here other than my daughter and I......no one is doing anything about it! GROSS"}
{"text":"When I found out a Panda Express was being built in Cuyahoga Falls- I was both equally elated and became suddenly ravenous for their DELICIOUS food!   Not only do they have a really fast & efficient drive thru, but the workers are super kind, friendly, and helpful. Alyssa K was super thoughtful and packed the sauce included in the kid's meal in a separate container because she didn't want him to think it was too hot. That might be something small to you fellow Yelpers, but it meant a lot to me. Food was hot and yummy- so I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have never been humiliated they way Maria did.  I ordered my meals and a $3.00 coke (refillable).  When I took my cup to be refilled I was told it would be an additional 50 cents. I told her I had paid for the $3.00 refillable her answer was \"that cup is not a refillable cup\". I went to the trash can and got my receipt and showed her that I was charged $3.00 and was given the wrong cup.  Maria took the receipt and said, \"This is not your receipt\".  Her coworker jump in and said \"that is right you didn't order the $3.00 coke\".  The manager (Kevin) heard the commotion and came to the rescue.  I explained to Kevin what happened and he refilled my cup.  I also told Maria she was a dishonest person and to admit her mistakes."}
{"text":"If you want to get food poisoning then come to this Panda Express location! My husband and I went to the drive thru to order food and was expecting to get cooked food NOT raw undercooked chicken! You would of thought that they would noticed that the chicken wasn't cooked when they were cutting it and not serve it to their customers!!! This is unacceptable! The only thing I like raw is my sushi thank you very much! So disgusting!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced Chinese food.  Fancy location, clean restaurant, good service, average-tasting dishes.  Staff are friendly, they let me taste-test before I pick. 1 entree and 1 side cost $7.90, and if you order 2 entrees you pay $9.30 which is on the expensive side. Quality is just OK, nothing special.  The egg roll did not taste good, and I couldn't finish it due to its taste.   I would not come back."}
{"text":"I finally got around to visiting since they first opened in heartland. The restaurant is clean, servers are very kind and helpful and the food is great. One of the best chinese takeout I've had. Everything had just come out of the wok when we ordered and the serving size was way beyond what we were expecting based on the low ratings. I suggest the orange chicken and honey shrimp. Yummy!! Will definitely be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went through drive thru thinking it would be faster. My mistake. after getting my drink, the girl told me to park at the designated drive thru spot. 10 minutes later still no food. I went inside asking where my order went. I was livid. I told the older lady who seems to be in charge and I finally got my order. Next time I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I hate to say it,  but the food was absolutely terrible tonight. I ordered my usual,  fried rice with orange chicken and sweet fire chicken. The food was lukewarm, the breading on the chicken was soggy,  and the rice bordered on chewy.  The orange chicken tasted as if it had been sitting out all day.    The lady who plated our food wasn't overly personable. I've been to this location a few times now, and it has been somewhat better on other visits. That, and my general dislike of giving 1 or 2-star reviews is the only thing that gives this location 3 stars. I probably won't return to this location again.  I've been going to various Panda locations across the U.S. for years, and I've had far better. The cashier was very friendly,  but unfortunately I did not catch her name to recognize her."}
{"text":"When we arrived in town and drove past this Panda Express my daughters fell in love with the outside decor.  It was not you typical Panda Express.  So, the next day for lunch I was informed that we HAD to go there.  The inside is different, just like the outside.  The food was the same, but the atmosphere is really nice."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst managed Panda Expresa I have dealt with. I am actually a forced regular because of the drive through and I have two small kids. Never go here when they open-they never heard of cooking before opening hours! Period. Also, when they are closed, the always post a 8x11 print out on the drive through pole, why not on the drive trough screen? Many times I got my chicken uncooked or completely cannot eat as is burnt. Another time, I was told to wait for the Cung pow as it was not ready, only to be told after 15-20mins that they messed up ingredient and would take a lot longer so I had to substitute side. I have basically gone here for more than a year mostly every sat or Sunday, so it's not like it is improving."}
{"text":"I was in the restaurant this evening around 9pm with my partner, and walked into a nearly empty buffet. Understanding it was almost closing time, I was deciding between what few choices they had left. Another customer just ahead of me asked for an item that was not prepare but on the menu, in which the employee replied \"we can make it for you if you want.\" The customer agreed, and the employee made the order - no problems. So I also asked for an item which was yet to be prepared but instead of the same compliance as she had with the previous customer, the employee hesitates, and asks if I'm sure, and continues to tell me that it'll take ten minutes. I assured that'd be fine, I was in no rush, and the look on her face screamed not impressed. She did get someone to make it though - which I appreciate greatly, but her whole aura, and attitude the entire time I was ordering was very impatient, and amateurish. She was even laughing with her coworkers in the back as multiple customers in the front were complaining amongst themselves and to the employees about the lack of ice in the machine. Hopefully they will hire more skilled workers for their restaurant in the future!"}
{"text":"Panda Express! Best Chinese food I've had in Ontario so far. It actually compares to PF Changs in Buffalo. Smells great. Looks great. We had orange chicken, sriracha shrimp, mixed veggies, fried rice, Kung pao chicken, sweet fire chicken. All were seasoned and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Update  was contacted by a customer service rep that actually cared aboutthis issue  so although at a different location..went to panda express on w bell the staff was much more pleasant. .took a bit because thus place was pretty busy but all in all a much better experience."}
{"text":"Manager of the restaurant, Gus, was super kind! The staff was helpful and patient. Food was good, but the temperature of the food was cold. Samples of food and specialty drinks we're be given out to guests."}
{"text":"Couldn't have had a better experience  the place was clean from top to bottom  . I was greeted immediately smiles all around . I was served fast   . Food was hot and fresh   drinks weren't watered down  tables were clean and staff didn't seem to have down time   , they were busy cleaning  and sweeping    highly recommended"}
{"text":"Hands down best customer service I've ever had at a Panda Express! Noemi was so friendly and helpful while she served our food. Each and every employee acknowledged me while I was there and were so nice! The food was fresh and tasted great but I was really impressed by the customer service I received. They really have it together at this location."}
{"text":"Pretty slow, but the food is good. They run out of different things a lot but they're also very busy. Seems like they may need another cook to keep up with all the ingredients. I love Panda though, so waiting is okay."}
{"text":"This location has better taste in their food (usually) than the one down the road at Ray and Price.  However, attitude is everything!  Don't go right near closing time. We have had issues going a few min before and then even 1/2h before closing to dine in.  First time, the girl asked what I wanted, \"took my order\", then said nothing and walked away, did something to the cash register (no other customers), then went over and locked the front door, talked with her colleagues, then told them she needed more of (what I ordered). Awesome.  Today, a surly kid was cleaning tables in the lobby. We were eating and he walked by and called over his shoulder, \"lobby closes in 5 minutes.\" Um, ok.   We finished eating and my son went to get a refill of his drink...nope! They (probably Surly Kid) turned off the drink machine at 9pm sharp. Only water. What a rip-off of purchasing their drinks for only 1 fill.  It looks like, by the other reviews, they can't handle things at drive-thru or lunchtime too well, either.   Management needs to get hold of this crew.  #customerserviceskillz"}
{"text":"Here's the deal! I like Pei Wei! Daughter likes Panda Express! One thing I learned is when you have a wife and daughter in the house, I don't win anything!!! It's always what they want?? I also learned, not to say to much about it! Anyway, we went to Panda Express! Did I mentioned my daughter loves this place?? We ordered their orange chicken, steamed rice, and some kid of mongolian beef! Food is OK, I have had better! (PEI WEI) The service is OK, problem is during eating time like lunch or dinner! It can get real crowded! So try and get here during off peak hours. Well we comeback?? Of course!! Daughter loves this place!!!"}
{"text":"Hungry after a concert, and decided to head up to the food court for a light snack.  Unfortunately, the girl working behind the counter could not be bothered to stop her chit-chat with friends.  It took several minutes until the little girl took her attention off her friends (who were not paying customers) to wait on me.  I asked for an egg roll to start.  They did not have any more. I asked her to please tell me what they DID have left, as nothing on display was labeled.  Her reply?  \"what you see \"  Needless to say, I informed her since she had so little interest in customer service, I would just go downstairs to Cafe de Luxe...where I should have gone to begin with.  It is sad that a hotel of this caliber hires people that probably should be working at McDonalds drive through!"}
{"text":"Upon entering I was greeted by one of the employees despite the fact that it was quite busy. There was a long line but the crew of employees handled it with ease and I had my food in no time. The food was hot and fresh and the meat was not over cooked. I was happy with this meal.   Overall I throughly enjoy my visit to this Panda Express and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"4:50 pm This place made us wait at the drive threw for 20mins for 2 plates and a kids meal. The man taking our order was rude while taking the order at the drive through. He literally Rushed Us. Gave us the wrong kids drink. This place is okay, needs a major improvement on their staff and their customer service even some of the ladies that work there are rude. Do not work in customer service, get a job where I don't see or deal with people.   Food- the food is standard but when they get to the bottom of the barrel of orange chicken they give the crumbs instead of making a fresh batch. They use the little bit of small pieces and put it in people order.   Ordered a Kung Pao Chicken ; barely any zucchini,  Cold, and majority of it was sauce. Disappointed.   Whoever is the owners or store manager please make these improvements. Please run a tighter ship. It's a fast food joint, however encourage your employees to have pride in their work if they think they are too good please let them go."}
{"text":"Horrible service! My husband and I used to come here all the time and will not be coming back! I have never walked out of any restaurant and I had to do so now. No less than 3 of their servers walked over and completely ignored me despite me being the only person in line. One of them just stood there with her hands on her hips and did not even bother to ask what I wanted or say hello or anything. Why do you have 5-6 people working if they cannot handle two orders, or even be respectful to your customers?"}
{"text":"They get the job done. The only place closest to Chinese food in this area. The workers seem like they don't really care. And my main gripe is that they served the shrimp way too soon one time, tasted like fish than honey so I knew it was undercooked. And I'm not a picky eater!"}
{"text":"They aren't even open on time its says that they open at 10am and it's now 10:18am.. I can understand 5min but 18min really? Smh"}
{"text":"Slowest Panda Express I have ever been to! I go there atleast 3 times a month and it's the closest one to my house. I'm there for about 30-45 minutes each time just to get food to go. Half the time the cashier has no idea what they are doing."}
{"text":"This was my first time back after 5 years.  At another location I got food poisoning, and then I waited a year to try and again at a different location only to get grossed out by a bone I found in my boneless sweet and sour pork.   So my opinion was not high of Panda after that although I did love their food I was rather scared.    So my husband finally talked me into going back.  I reluctantly agreed.... but I did go.  The food was not as yummy as I remember it 5 years ago but this is my first time at this location.    It was good don't get me wrong but once you have a certain quality of taste and service and you don't get that its always a bit disappointing.  The experience was better then my last 2 but I am still afraid and sat there kinda picking through the food in fear of something going wrong again.    I am just not sure I can get over my past fears.  For everyone else I would say go ahead and try it.  My husband and friends love it and have never had a bad experience.  I just seem to be the one prone to finding the hair in my food of something else awful.    Overall the food did taste good it's just no longer a place I am comfortable at.... nothing against this location."}
{"text":"The manager and the employees are really rude....  1-I asked for half rice half chow main and they gave me such a small portion of it even that I was purchasing 7+ plates I had to request for more (even if I had to pay extra) oh and for the orange chicken they only put like 5 pieces  2- I ask for a rag because the tables where really dirty and the supposably mgr never have me or went out with one yo clean the table..  3- I ask for chili sauce and for 7+ plates they give me 7 packets (like really) lol I ask for more and the cashier tells me she can't give me more or she will get in trouble with her mgr next to her... so my husband went and ask for the manager and tells her she need chili sauce for 7 people because the cashier didn't wanted to give us more... to what she reply- oh it's because you have to ask me for it .... like really?"}
{"text":"Where to start? Well, for one, we went inside instead of through the drive through. We were trying to order and the lady didn't, idk, understand I guess? My mom was ordering her's and my brother's meals, but I guess she mistook my brother's for mine because I interjected when my mom said something wrong about the order? She despite obviously conversing with my mother, she walked her over to the POS to have her pay and left me standing over by the starting point. My mom noticed but her protests seemed to fall on deaf ears. The lady employee was insistent on checking her out, so mom just gave up and gave me the card so I could pay for my own food.  When we sat down to eat, the table was encrusted with sauce and had flecks of food everywhere. The entire table. At this point, though, my younger brother had sat down and started eating, so we were committed now. We got a napkin and scrubbed it off.  My mom has dietary restrictions. However, you know that places like this with the big batch scoop and go format doesn't make things to order, so she was fully ready to pick the offending ingredients out (in this case, mushrooms) of the angus steak. She wasn't expecting, though, that the entire portion was mostly mushrooms. Literally two pieces of meat, as you can see in the photos. The last straw for her was that her favorite tea wasn't there. You know, the fruit tea? They normally have a fruit iced tea. They didn't have it. She payed for a large drink in anticipation, and then couldn't use it because of the same dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Food is good only because of massive amounts of MSG.  Also, you NEVER pay what the menu advertises because they have many hidden  extra costs that you don't find out about until you get to cashier.  $1.00 more for shrimp? PUT IT ON THE MENU!!"}
{"text":"very cheap on their portions.. super disappointed because what was supposed to be a dinner is now a snack. Feel bad for the one employee working, not his fault seemed to be under staffed. probably would have gotten more food in a kids meal... this was my full meal."}
{"text":"Nastiest Panda Express I have ever been to.  Just yesterday I visited one about 15 miles away. And the food was excellent there but in this one I even returned the rice to the cashier before I walked out because I just couldn't down it.   The veggies were undercooked I could taste the rawness of them.  But that to me was edible because I like raw vegetables though I know it's not supposed to be raw at this food joint.  The chicken terriaki was edible but not exactly enjoyable because i attend Panda Express often in various other places and could tell that it was a bit bland.  I am blacklisting this place, and will never return.   There are plenty of other eager restaurants out there that will gladly satisfy their customers."}
{"text":"Just found a long hair in our food. My husband almost choked to death. Notifying corporate."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this Panda Express. My husband told me to go to the Panda Express on bell road, but this one is closer. I always order half chow mein and half fried rice, but I couldn't order the fried rice because the guy putting food in the trays dropped the pen in the fried rice and failed to remove the fried rice. That makes it contaminated. They were super busy and you can hear everyone gasp when he dropped the pen and didn't even remove the food. Nobody was wearing gloves. I don't know why the guy would use his hands to scoop the food that fell out of the take out boxes into the box as well. Panda Express is always our go to place to eat for dinner when I never cook so I am disappointed. I will be driving to the Panda Express a couple miles down the road even if it is farther from my home."}
{"text":"The noodles are not the best. The service is sub par. I had to ask 3 different times for an empty to go box and the woman tried to give me the food for the person behind me EVERY time! I understand that there was a language barrier but if you are going to be the one dealing with customers it might be a good idea to be bilingual. I love Panda Express but this location needs some work."}
{"text":"Been going here quite often the past couple of weeks during lunch time, and the employees are always very nice. I've never felt rushed to order here compared to other Panda's that I've been to. The place is usually kept very clean, and the only issue I see sometimes is their trash cans being full. Food is always pretty fresh and have never had to complain about the quality."}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express I've ever eaten at!!!! My chow mien was full of oil! I mean drenched! The spring rolls were hard and tasted like old grease! Disgusting! Save your money!!"}
{"text":"This location stops serving food almost an hour before closing after they run out of food cooked on the line! I am displeased with the fact that I waited from 9pm-9:30pm in line for a honey walnut shrimp bowl and did not receive my food! Stores closes at 10pm!  When I ordered my food there wasn't any honey walnut shrimp left and I explained to the the lady working named Sarai that I do not eat meat; only seafood. She offered tofu but I told her that I only waited in line for the honey walnut shrimp. She said sorry we don't have any right now so I rejected the half made bowl containing rice and left! She did not offer to make more food and the entire line had no other options even for someone who does eat meat! Unsatisfied, I called to speak with a store manager! Sarai the same lady who refused to make my order answered stating she was the store manager and than left a store credit in my name for me to pick up the following day!   I appreciate the gesture to correct the mistake but will not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"I'm just fed up with this Panda. I've previously had spoke experience here, and called it into their corporate office. They responded, and compensated us with 2 gift cards to give them another chance. This, however isn't what's concerning to me. My fiance, unsure if Firecracker Chicken was still available decided to try and contact them over the phone before sending me down to pick up dinner. She was hung up on- FOUR TIMES. She decided to try and look at the menu online and ran across the Yelp reviews of this particular store. I noticed on many of the poor reviews that were responded to buy corporate all had the same verbiage that I was given- \"We will be in touch with the management at this location to let them know what happened.\" So clearly, either is the management doesn't care, or corporate isn't actually reaching out to them, or nobody is paying attention to their field operations at this unit. I've never seen a chain fast-casual restaurant have so many consistent issues. It seems as if the entire management team and or staff need to be replaced with people who actually give a damn.   Do yourself a favor, and try one of the other locations instead. Unless you're into poor service and unhappy employees - then this location is just for you!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! Waited 25 min for our food!  The drive thru was crazy busy. The young woman at the window stated that she was alone trying to take care of the drive thru and trying to make Orange chicken 0.o -- First of all that was too much information - secondly I hope that was not the case!!! All I know is that I won't be returning... :/"}
{"text":"This Branch of Panda Express sucks,, I order 2 entree one side. I ordered beef broccoli and orange chicken for my entree. Just had 3 tiny piece of beef on my \"beef broccoli\". My food was cold and orange chicken is so vinegary. Very disappointing just waist my money."}
{"text":"In 2007, I finally pulled into our beloved Tempe after driving for 16hrs from what felt like the other side of the world. We were exhausted, emotionally and physically taxed, and ravenous. Didn't want to go through a drive-thru. Like hell either one of us was cooking. So we hopped out for Panda Express takeaway.  I ate & went to bed. Got up a couple of hours later to fasten my head to the porcelain god for the entire rest of the night. I rang in my first sunrise back in AZ for 2007 purging my \"meal\" from the night previous through vomitous fanfare.   I can't even go near one of these poor excuses for Chinese food now. Haven't touched it since. Did I gross you out? Don't blame me. Blame Panda."}
{"text":"This Panda Express location is good. I decided to eat something new since I kept eating the same thing over and over. I decided to try Panda Express at UNLV. The food here is good and the service was good also. The one thing I hate is that the food/entrees needs more flavor but still good. Will come back."}
{"text":"Refueling, not fine dining, was my major objective in stopping at this Panda Express. It was now 11:30am and I had eaten breakfast at 4:30am so my tummy was rumbling and I was feeling kind of shaky.  I got the 2 item entree for $7.12 with tax. The items were orange chicken and Beijing Beef with fried rice. The orange chicken was certainly sweet enough to kick my blood sugar back up into the normal range (and then some). The beef was sort of dried out and cut in bigger lumps. They only give you a plastic fork to eat this stuff with and a knife would have been helpful to cut these pieces into more manageable bites (maybe they don't want to arm their customers). The fried rice was also dried out (at 11:30am, REALLY?). The food tastes unremarkable. A fortune cookie was included in the lunch. The menu was more limited than what I have seen at other Panda Express stores. Overall, a less than average food experience."}
{"text":"I got thw broccoli beef and fried rice..very bland, not enough food ready only about 2 meat options, 1 person was serving and was very slow about it. There was only 1 person ahead of me and I waited about 5 minutes before she was able to help me.  Also I took my food to go and was not given any napkins or even a fork."}
{"text":"We wanted a simple lunch. But the way we were treated was not what I expected. A lady names NELLY was the rudest person i have ever met while eating panda. She was rude and had attitude like she hated her job. Im sorry i love panda express but this experience at this location was the worst. She not only through our food in a plate but she made us very uncomfortable and the way she speaks to people is very unacceptable and unprofessional. I will be taking this to corporate."}
{"text":"always friendly, prompt with the service, and food is good quality, fresh, and hot ! I got 4 meals, to go. Kung Pow, Orange chicken, mushroom chicken and Beijing Beef, chow mein and rice. All was great ."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but they're so stingy with their food. They'd fill your box or bowl almost full with rice or noodle, then they only give you one scoop of the dish you  actually want. So cheap!"}
{"text":"I give this Panda Express 4 stars because their lomein noodles, orange chicken, 8 Treasure Chicken, stir fry rice is most delicious. The portions are large and plentiful. My wife MJ loves their noodles & egg rolls. The Panda folks will provide taste samples of as many different entres as you would ask for. So if you are unsure what to order, just ask for samples !"}
{"text":"Don't normally comment on chain restaurants, but this was my first Panda drive-thru. The food was Panda's normal 4-star, \"Yay, I'm a fan,\" level.    It's was hard to fill out the Panda survey. For example, were the trays full? Not sure, it was a drive-thru."}
{"text":"I searched for Panda Express and this location is not listed.  I have been to most of the Panda Express locations on the west side of town and generally like the food. I typically have orange chicken and bejing beef, if I have one of the survey receipts I will try something different for the free third entree.  I especially like the store located at Buffalo and Lake Mead and the store at Durango just north of Centenial.  That brings me to the Charleston/Hualapai store. I have been there twice and both times the portions have been smaller than I am used to at other locations. The entree size is about 1/2 to 2/3 what is received at other locations. The rice and chow mein servings are typical of other locations.  The first time I went, I noticed the smaller portions, but figured it may be a fluke since all the other stores serve larger portions. I was working in the area and the store was convenient, so I thought I would give it another try, same result, smaller portions. So I have to assume this is typical of this particular store.  Since there are many Panda Expresses around town and they are not that far apart, it is worth the extra 5 minutes to go to a different location, for the larger portions, at least for me. Others have to make that decision for themselves."}
{"text":"I think they gave me food poisoning! This has got to be the worst one in town!! Food is typically OK here, however never again after they got me sick! I won't ever be back!!"}
{"text":"i'm a fan of Panda Express but I gotta say this spot did not do it for me.  My orange chicken and beef and broccoli tasted mediocre compared to the many many other Panda's I've gone to (and I've been to my fair share!).  The workers were less than enthusiastic and were not generous with their portions."}
{"text":"I got a coupon and it said a free plate when you buy one it didn't include sides a thought a plate was everything and the free food with coupon they gave me was like 4 pieces of orange chicken not enough to feed a 2 year old a sample they should of stated on coupon it was a sample and the food was bland bad no taste or maybe it taste kinda like card board this place isn't all that great unless your starving and its the only place close to you the cost is also high for the quality of the food its like generic Chinese made by teens not saying teens can't cook but they lack experience they are great cooks when you want pizza rolls lol well the manager did get back to my review fast that's great so service is good so this place is not all bad and its new so maybe I will try it again"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and went through the drive thru. They handed us a bag with sweet and sour sauce spilled everywhere. Went home and they gave me like 5 pieces of Beijing beef... I'm kinda pissed. Not going back. Ever."}
{"text":"This place has the best employees they are super nice!!! And the food is great too! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Just went to Panda drive thru waited longer than 30 minutes, paid $10 for my meal, asked the girl for sauce and she acted inconvenienced! Really? Then no sweet & sour sauce for my spring rolls plus only two pieces of orange chicken! Worst experience ever!! They're lucky I'm feeling generous and gave them two stars."}
{"text":"I was extremely hungry after shopping at Wal-Mart and stopped by here to get some food. The staff were friendly and service was quick. Unfortunately some of the food was mushy, chewy, or spongy. Orange chicken was good, egg roll was good, Chow me in and rice were good, Tea was delicious! Terriyaki chicken and Kung Pao were very bizarre (Chewy etc). Not bad for Orange chicken or tea and noodles/rice. But needs some improvement on certain entrees."}
{"text":"I know that this a new location but you guys gotta get fast people at the front of the service line. Whoever is there right now is too slow and people have been waiting over 10 minutes."}
{"text":"It's conveniently located, but I have to stop going there.   Staff (most staff) and food never fail to disappoint.   Also agree with other reviews, this location is the worst!"}
{"text":"Got the honey sesame chicken, honey walnut shrimp & chowmein! Can it get any sweeter? LOL Service was quick for us comin in for take out! Came just in time for the honey walnut shrimp was being refilled!! So YES! Hot & fresh! Thank u & as ALWAYS.... I'll be back! Smooches"}
{"text":"This used to be a 3 star joint in my opinion but, they've been going uphill for quite some time. The customer service is good. The food - good. You can get half and half on the side item (fried rice and noodles or white rice and mixed veggies etc). The prices are fair for what you get - I love the new pacific chilli shrimp! I miss the firecracker chicken - they only do it at a certain time of year - I'm always sad when it goes! Anyway - great lunch joint - keep the receipt - fill out the survey - get a free item. They pay attention to the surveys and respond quickly! Love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband, 2yo, 4yo and me love this place for its quick and tasty chow mein and fried rice!  Service is very friendly and fast!  We should own stock in this company. We have many options since we live in the neighborhood (Pei Wei is next block over), but Panda Express' noodles are not soggy like others...It tastes fresh. Plus drive thru is super handy when you have kids in the car and you don't want to be hassling with belt buckles in and out..."}
{"text":"I like the overall Panda chain although its not considered authentic Chinese food. Its OK value for a variety of food in a box where food taste are consistent at all the branches I've been to  In regards to this specific store, I like it more than the other ones on the Strip (vs the Miracle Mile mall and the 24hour food court near the Adidas store/MGM). Its has a larger dining area which is relatively clean. Line moves quickly. Samples are available. Food generally available vs waiting for items. Kitchen looks bigger than other stores which gives the feeling of more cleanliness.  One tip is to fill out the survey online and bring that receipt with the code next time and you will get a free entree. Its usually a Letter followed by 4 numbers, e.g. N1804 (they don't check the number)"}
{"text":"There food tastes way better than any Panda Express I had in a while  I just think u need to make sure it's fresh. But other than that there food is scrumptious"}
{"text":"Panda express, which is located inside Sante Fe Casino's food court, is probably not the best, but better then others.   Decided to eat here, after the movie, cause I was running kind of late and didn't want to miss the previews. But after the movie, didn't want to go around the concession stands just to get food to bring home. So decided to hit up the food court and eat there before going home.  So I stopped at Panda Express, since its probably the only thing that actually look good there.   First off, it seems like the person behind the counter, really didn't want to serve me or talk to the cook, till I creep close enough to be looking over the counter. Got myself some Chow Mien, Honey Walnut Shrimp and Beijing beef. Kind of wondering, why isn't it on a tray or something.  Basically I just had a plate to carry around. I gave her a 20, and she gave me my  change, and when I looked up, she disappeared. That's probably the only thing I didn't like about this Panda Express.   The food on the other hand, is edible, but I was really hungry, that I just ate it. It was decent, I don't have any gurgling sound in my tummy, so I guess it wasn't to greasy. So, I give the food a thumbs up.   Over all, I just gave this an OK rating, cause I think the customer service could of been much better, but the food on the other hand, made up for it."}
{"text":"portions keep getting smaller and food doesn't taste as good as it did before. definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today after Walmart.  The crew took a few minutes to take care of the two people ahead of us, the guy with the headset started on our orders then passed us off to a girl after getting a drive through order.  No problem.  My wife had the Kung Pao Chicken bowl with fried rice, my daughter had the String Bean Chicken Breast bowl with fried rice, I had the Beijing Beef bowl with steamed vegetables.  We all enjoyed our meals.  Even though the Kung Pao and Beijing Beef are supposed to be spicy they were very mild compared to actual spicy oriental food.  The steamed vegetables were excellent for a fast food place.  The serving line and dining area was very clean."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express so I came to this one. I stood in line and there was one lady working that I could see. I was behind the person ordering their food. Then a man walks up to the glass in front of the food basically cutting me in line. The worker woman had looked at me multiple times already and knew my place in line but she served this random dude who just showed up. I had already been standing in line for a while at this point. I looked at both of them in amazement and the lady didn't even acknowledge me. So I walked away in frustration. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only place I eat on my break because it's fast and convenient. Not only that but the staff that work at this location are very friendly and always greeting customers constantly asking if everything is okay with the food. It may get a little hectic sometimes but hey what do expect it's a mall with lots of foot traffic and hungry customers. Overall this place is awesome and always clean. The General Manager here is a great guy"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst panda location I've ever been to. We live close and have been here a few time with the same service. They never put teriyaki sauce on the chicken even after you request it. then they do not put it on the side. They also are really slow!. even when there are only a few people in line...it takes 20 min to get your food. If you order through the app they always forget something. do t waist your money."}
{"text":"This place sucks. They never have what's on the menu.How do you not have rice or chicken! Long lines, long waits. The food is not good compared to other Panda's"}
{"text":"You can definitely go to Vegas and not spend lot's of money on food. Ps.fs rxpress is located in a lull mall area on the strip. Surrounded by other small restaurants, this was a perfect meal. For$8 I got 3 sides to choose from.  I left full and with extra money to spend at the casinos.  I ordered the Orange chicken, although it was good, it was a bit dry. I did order at 830 so maybe it was the last batch they had."}
{"text":"Picked up two entrees (~$6; credit cards accepted) to serve as a poor man's brunch. Can't beat this location's convenience, and service was good. If only they were open 24 hours...  Before you judge me, Panda Express is my guilty pleasure, and like all guilty pleasures, you're not too choosy after an all-nighter. I know Panda isn't real Chinese food, but nor is it Americanized Chinese; it's Panda. And since they're inexplicably hard to find on the East Coast, I lust after their chow mein once in a blue moon[1].  [1] Yes, it's sad, I know."}
{"text":"Hungry and short on time? Panda Express might fit your bill.  We were staying at Red Rock, and decided to take advantage of their food court. From our hotel room, it was a bit of a haul to get to, but otherwise was pretty convenient, with the usual gamut of chain restaurants - like a Panda Express.  Got two combination plates (and some wontons) to go: a plate of fried rice with orange chicken and Beijing beef (not that good), and a plate of with chow mein (those noodles are wayyyy better than I remember) with mushroom chicken and broccoli beef.  We feasted on the Americanized Chinese grub in our room - there were no leftovers. Sometimes all you need is slightly-pricey, greasy food to keep you fed, and Panda served."}
{"text":"Dinner Crawl in Surprise. It's Panda  Express.  This is fast food imitation Chinese food!! It's good for what it is.  Want upscale, go to Pei Wei, that's not good enough, go to PF Changs! (see where I'm going with this?!)   It's Panda Express, get the green bean chicken, feel good about being nice and leaving an honest review.. ;)"}
{"text":"incredibly slow and incompetent staff. the management seems to offer no direction to the teenagers running the line. takes 10-15 minutes to get up to order, another 10 for them to make the food because the always run out of everything, and another 5 minutes for an employee to decide to ring you out."}
{"text":"Panda Express inside the Planet Hollywood is a great place for some Chinese food. The pricing is very reasonable for a strip location, I love it. You can try before you buy - that's really nice too."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times the food was fresh and really good. Employees were normal, nice ect.   Pretty clean, AND they have a drive thru which is awesome."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Americanized Chinese food, this is the defacto place to go. Located at the corner of Green and Wright, this Panda Express replaces the old Follett's bookstore, securing a hot location across the street from Everitt Lab (too bad ECE has moved to ECEB). The food is as you'd expect - sweet, salty, unhealthy, and exactly what you were looking for. Prices are reasonable, and you get a fair amount of food. Lines can be long during peak hours, but you can order online and do a pickup. Tons of seating (two floors) available, and the whole place is pretty nice and clean."}
{"text":"By far the SLOWEST unhelpful rude employee's we've come across at a Panda Express.  Every single employee was working at a snail's pace. We wanted sweet fire chicken , it was old and dry and the only polite employee a young man offered us a fresh batch. 30 MINUTES later we decided to change it to teriyaki chicken.   Not one apology or SMILE. They left our rice veggies on the top counter to cool off.   Well we shall never visit this location again.  Oh and the line grew to 15 people waiting and waiting."}
{"text":"It's panda which = quick \"chinese\" fix. nothing special to set this one apart from the rest."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! It has fantastic flavor in all the dishes, especially the kungpao chicken which is my favorite spicy dish here. The staff are kind and speedy. If you don't like the look of a dish, you CAN ASK them to make a fresh batch. It will only take a few minutes but still worth it.  I've worked here when I was 18 & was obsessed with the food. It's fresh & I still love coming here. I've worked at PF Changs too and for a quarter of the price and 2x's the flavor, this location is a WIN!"}
{"text":"As always, the food of Panda is amazing, but of the twelve times I've come in here, the staff is less than warm and welcoming.  The food is always delish, and generally speaking fresh too ;) it's in the mall, so you get to grab your food and get out from under the unfriendly gaze of the servers, abd enjoy your hot and steaming Panda Express meal. . . Mmmmm. . Yummy."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this Panda in probably 9 mos. Every time I went, the dish I order was never ready. There have even been times when the white rice was not ready. Isn't this a staple of Chinese Cuisine?   I am an early lunch eater and today I arrived shortly after 11am.  Once again the mushroom chicken wasn't ready. It's never ready. You just opened, how do you not have a full supply of everything? So I waited, but only because there were 2 cars ahead of me and no way out of the drive thru. The cashier apologized for the wait. No offer of a free eggroll or drink which would have gone a long way. When I got back to my office, I found that half the rice was not cooked long enough. So now I'm having light chicken and hard rice after a routine unpleasant experience.  Never again Panda. Unlike the rice - I am done. I've given you way too many chances. Shame on me."}
{"text":"Experience started with no toilet paper in ladies room and ended with rude customer service.  Monica never acknowledged me as a customer while I was the ONLY person standing at the counter and she stocked her station with lids.  After returning back to the register to give me my total I spoke to Monica and asked her how her day was going.  What happened to greeting customers?  What happened to acknowledging someone and asking them to wait?  I'm all for better wages to restaurant workers but let's face it, many front line staff like Monica do not demonstrate their worth for no more than what they are getting.  Maybe we wouldn't rant on the negative if there were more positive.  I don't pay discounted prices so why should I expect or accept discounted services."}
{"text":"I had come in the lobby, once I got to the cashier the lady named Yolanda was very unprofessional, getting through the line I was greeted with smiles.. but once I got to the end of the line she was very rude. Her attitude was very condescending, it felt like she was mad that we were there. Once we had sat down we realized Yolanda had charged us wrong, when we asked to speak to a manager Yolanda just walked away, I had to ask another associate to get a manager.  The manager spoke to named Zach was very apologetic and professional. He did not hesitate to get our plate and even offer an egg roll. I will be coming back to this store but hopefully with a different cashier!"}
{"text":"What a effing joke.. came in at 9pm, took5 minutes to be acknowledged,  then told they are out of rice.... you are panda express... how the hell do you not have rice... thats like kfc not having chicken.. youre a god damn chinese restaurant.. rice is the cheapest of your overhead.. your staff needs training"}
{"text":"First visit to Panda Express.    The first person at the counter taking our order, was friendly and very nice, we told her it was our first visit and she offered us a sample of a main dish if we wanted. Not to many places offer that. The second person as our plate was passed down the line was just as friendly.   I enjoyed the Teriyaki Chicken, fried rice and spring roll on the whole. They serve PepsiCo products, so I was able to get my raspberry ice tea !    Ok negative ... it wasn't the best part of the chicken. I cut away most of the ends. I will try something different next time.   I will return, but I won't go out of my way for fast food Chinese. I am glad we stopped, I am glad I had a chance to try it."}
{"text":"Foods great. I like coming to this location, except I'm not sure why the female employee (I think her name starts with an \"N\") is so rude to customers. She does her best to make everyone aware that she is unhappy. It's really annoying every time I come in. Foods great though other than that."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss  Sometimes you have a craving for a certain food but you really don't want to take the time and trouble to get dressed up or sit in a restaurant so that's when you go for take out.   Tonight I had a craving for Chinese, and  I wanted someplace close.  So Panda Express it was. As I waited in line I noticed that many of the selections were in short supply and two of the advertised \"specials\" were completely empty.  I assumed that the cook was in the process of refilling the empty trays. However, I was wrong.  When it was my turn, I was advised that it would be several minutes before new entrees would be ready, so I was limited to what was on hand.  To be honest I  did not find the food to be very tasty, certainly not even good fast food Chinese.   So this is my conclusion of Panda Express.  No, the quality and taste is not that of P.F. Chang but you could do worse in a pinch.  I satisfied my craving for Chiense while watching my favorite television shows. Sometimes, it's all about choices"}

{"text":"By far the lowest quality panda express I have been to multiple menu items missing and when I requested fried they stated it would take an hour to cook. Staff is not very friendly."}
{"text":"First time i have been to panda express multiple meats are not available and all employee's where in the back socializing."}
{"text":"What can you say about Panda Express Fast Food?----It's fast and that's it.  Nothing to get your palate all excited about or go out of your way for...It is just plain ol' sustenance at a glance.  Put your money down and they stuff you.  Now move it!  Pros about this franchise: It's fast!--- Cons about this franchise: It's fast!---  As they would say in older Taco Belch commercials----\"Want Some?\""}
{"text":"After standing in the long line and getting back to my place of work as I'm eating, I take a sip of my \"Mountain Dew\" only to find out that I have a huge cup of carbonated water that made me gag. Immediately I call down to tell them of the mistake as they shew me off the phone and tell me just to come get a free soda. Will chalk up the loss on a $3.00 drink, but will not be eating at this establishment again."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Chinese food nor am I a big fan of fast food, but sometimes when I come home, I see Panda Express boxes in the fridge, so obviously, I know that my husband cheats on me on Panda Express but doesn't want to get in too much trouble so he tries to make it better by getting me something too. Lol. Can't go wrong with chow mein and honey walnut shrimp!"}
{"text":"Ever since they changed over to this management things at this Panda Express has gone steadily downhill. The employees are still pleasant but look uneasy when the new manager is there. I get that its \"fast food\" but the quality lately is horrible. Everything is overcooked, greasy and not fresh. The current manager has a nasty attitude when serving. The old manager Minnie seemed to have everything and everyone in good morale. A smile goes a long way and so does a good attitude. Will drive to GVR food court for my Panda Express fix."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and just don't eat here. After living in the area for 5 years I have never had a good experience or properly prepared food. It's been months since my last visit. I was quickly reminded why I avoid this location. I received my meal got home and was overwhelmed by the order of burnt food. Gross burnt and inedible."}
{"text":"What can I say I'm a sucker for their orange chicken . Pretty decent Chinese food for a quick fix . The Honey walnut shrimp is an other favorite I get :)"}
{"text":"Lousy service, I was the only one in line & my order was filled  except or one item. The cook prepared 3 other items for nobody that was in line & no nobody in the restaurant? After the cook filled the three other items for nobody then the cook prepared my order while my food got cold. I got a refund and went to El Bravo Mexican food which is the best food in the entire Valley Panda Express is bad and dirty"}
{"text":"Been going to this Panda at Silverado Ranch for years. Lately the food hasn't been that great. I usually get the Orange Chicken. Last time when I got home it tasted like soy sauce. The cook obviously cooked with the wrong sauce. It was horrible. My son informed me that I need to always sample before ordering and if it sucks to leave. They don't always get it right.  I did go again and noticed that the cook, not the same as the last one, was one that I have always liked when he was working cause he actually put sauce on the chicken. If there is enough sauce you will realize that it has a kick to it.  Well, he didn't disappoint me. It was awesome!!! The workers were very nice and professional. There is one server who can be quit rude but she was not there last night, so it made for a great experience this time."}
{"text":"They need to hire people that can understand how to take orders properly! I was asking about a couple entrees and the lady continuously was placing the orders and I would have to stop her and correct her. She still got my order wrong and it sucked! This was my first time back in 2 years and I wont return!"}
{"text":"I am writing this Yelp review after encountering one of Panda's employees named Sadie. As we arrived just after 4pm, we walked up to the line and saw that there were only about half a dozen pieces of orange chicken left and asked when more would be ready. She rolled her eyes, sighed, turned around to look and said \"like, I don't know, 5 minutes?\" (I did not put a question mark on accident). Ignoring her blatant rudeness, my girlfriend and I said that we would happily wait (since the food court was NOT busy at all and no one else was in line). She then proceeded to asked what else we wanted and we ordered a plate (orange chicken, sweet fire chicken, white rice and chow mein). She immediately started scooping away and put everything in the box (including the leftover pieces of orange chicken that we specifically said we did not want). Seeing this, I told her that we did not want that orange chicken and that we had no problem waiting. This is when she aggressively scooped out (only half) the orange chicken and threw the box down while scoffing. I ignored this outburst and went to pay with the cashier (Kassandra M). As we were paying I saw Sadie scoop the old orange chicken back in our box and brought it over to us. Outraged, I kept my cool and told her what I saw. Without an actual answer, she laughed threw half of the orange chicken back, waited for the new orange chicken to be ready and put the new chicken on top of our old. Because we already paid, I took this, threw it away and went to a more friendly choice at the food court. I will never go to Panda Express again and will encourage everyone I know to do so as well."}
{"text":"I had the worst service here the customer service is awful the girl at the drive thru her name was Anna was so rude she acted like if we were a worry on her she was playing around with the other girl that was inside and throwing things and was giving dirty looks then I asked when I pulled up if I could add 1 egg roll and a side of rice then she rolled her eyes and acted like it was the hardest thing to do then she closed the window and was telling the girl inside something then they both just stared it was awkward and annoying even as we drove away they stared"}
{"text":"Read my other reviews, I'm usually very detailed and try to give a good review.  This deserves the following 4 words...  Mall Chinese, Nuff said"}
{"text":"I am a food courier who arrived at 10:55pm to pick up an order that was placed in the app at 10:48pm.  Posted closing time was 11pm, but the employees had already locked up the store, the drive through speaker was an automated message saying the store was closed, and the employees ignored me and another food courier who were knocking on the door.  At the very least, they could have canceled the order before we wasted the time driving there, or had the decency to tell us they were closed and weren't going to fulfill the order. Instead, I had to waste 5 minutes on the phone with support to get the order canceled.  Management should be aware that employees at this location close up 5 minutes early on Friday night, probably even earlier.  I know it was 5 minutes before 11pm because the app established this and the clock on my phone (which is set to internet network time) said 10:55pm..."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-through get to the window they gave me somebody else's order. I let the lady know that it was not my order. She then asked me if I still wanted my order after I paid. I had to set in the drive-through for 10 minutes for them to make my order and then I received it and it still wasn't made right this is ridiculous. If you want your order all nest next up and come here I asked to speak to a manager and her remark was there isn't a manager on duty. Will never come here again this is the static"}
{"text":"No complaints about this location.   - Good quality compared to other Panda locs  - Clean inside and bathrooms - Drive thru has been consistent for me in terms of the orders being right - A couple cuties on staff (especially the one working drive thru today..wow lol)  Yup...I'm good to go!"}
{"text":"Quality of the food was good enough for the money I spend. Considering it was a large order and the staff did not mess it up was good enough for 5 stars. Tried the General Tso's chicken for first time. It was good but I wouldn't say I prefer it over sweet fire chicken. Restaurant was clean and staffs were kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Has been good at times, but more often not. It seems a lot of the food just sits out for quite some time and just never seems very fresh. The restaurant is pretty clean though."}
{"text":"Went in tonight only 2 workers I only gave it 3 stars because berto was working his butt off cooking serving and bagging while the girl there just looked around and didn't seem to do much of anything at all. Berto keep it cool even under pressure about 15 people in line and more coming in! Way to go berto"}
{"text":"Why do you have someone who barely speaks English working the drive thru?? So much time wasted. Anywhere but on the phone or drive thru."}
{"text":"Since friend was getting hungry and didn't want to eat my yogurt dish, we opted to get chinese food.  Yes, it's not real chinese food but it'll do if you're hungry and want something filling.  I thought the food was pretty tasty since we ordered the chow mein, mushroom chicken and orange peel beef.  The only bad part was that both friend and I got upset stomachs later on in the night.  Not sure what happened here since we do eat at Panda Express near us and we never had a problem before.  So I guess it was an off night for both of us. =/"}
{"text":"I asked for water. Lady asked me where my cup is. Yes I had water earlier. But I didn't save the cup. Whoa she gave me very bad look like I am stupid."}
{"text":"Went in on Friday night... It was pretty steady, they ran out of fried rice so we had to wait some extra time for our order, that's understandable. But the workers provided the worst customer service I've had in a long time. Jose was extremely rude and had a pretty big issue with me asking for a plate with two sides and one entree instead of 2 entrees with one side. I didn't think it was that big of a deal but he made it clear that he had a problem with it. I'm so glad I don't live in Laveen anymore and won't have to put up with terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Ordering food for a friend.  I would never eat at Panda.  Unflavorful and greasy.  I am writing more about the service.  Yes I guess it was food court after all, but that still does not make it right to have bad customer service.  The cashier reached over the counter to grab this small container to see what was in it.  I told her orange chicken, and then she threw it back in my bag and it was tipped over.  Careless."}
{"text":"We visited at 5:34 PM on a Monday and it was quiet in here, there was a couple eating inside. Miriam was a totally sweetheart.  She made sure everything was fresh and even paid close attention to our order.  She request more grilled chicken from the cook when she heard the order.  The other girl working who GREETED US made me feel very welcome.  I can't express the level of service here. She even asked if we wanted the teriyaki on the side or on the chicken.  Crab Rangoons were a little over cooked but they were still good, I like them crispy.  The little things matter to me, fast and polite for sure!  When we got home which is exactly 10 minutes away.  The grilled chicken was still hot and fresh.  It smelled amazing all the way home, just torture. :)   I have to say the friend rice was very tasty, not like other bland & boring locations.  By the way the directions on yelp are WRONG!  We drove right passed it on Charleston you can't miss the giant sign inside the plaza! Update: I made changes to the pin point on Yelp, they will review the changes."}
{"text":"The food was soggy the chow mein was dry. When i first came in i was ignored. Never coming back. I usually go to the one on 51st ave and baseline definitely going back to that one next time. They have fresh food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I went there for thw first time in  September 2016. Ordered on line and had my husband pick it up. My total was 9 dollar. They gave my husband someone elses order. Not only that my card was charged 27 dollars and 9 dollars. I returned the food next day and one of the guys offered to just give me a plate until I said 30 dollar worth? Manager came took my details and gave me a gift card. But I swore not again..it has been 3 months ans I have not received my money.  Every time I go to ask where my money, they say they will call me back and nothing. Stay away!!!!!!!!!!DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR!!!!"}
{"text":"Muh fuggin Panda Express!!! I am so happy they came back to Pittsburgh area! Their food is always so good We love it. Some of the workers at this specific establishment are sort of crabby and not so friendly but as long as they have orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp then idgaf!"}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend because we were craving Asian and this is sadly the only place I know of that's decent without getting food poisoning.  The fried rice was bland, no flavor.  I tried the cod they had and I actually liked it. Still went with  sweet fire (spicy sweet & sour) chicken and grilled teriyaki chicken. It was really good but I would of been happier if they had sweet and sour chicken that's my favorite. We've come here twice and both times have been good experiences. Just wish it was slightly better the food didn't seem flavorful it was just OK.  Very clean restruant however."}
{"text":"Clean place and for some reason has some of the best Teriyaki chicken I've ever had at any other PE."}
{"text":"I know all too well that Panda Express is sometimes a hit or miss but I would be more interested in reading REAL reviews from REAL people!!! One profile was created from CA apparently only to diss this establishment, the other gives bad reviews to places in CA and AZ and claimes to be a resident of both places (??).  Disgruntled employees?"}
{"text":"Drive-thru should be open until 10:30 but they stop making any food about 8 or 9 and just serve you scraps as you approach the window. The recording on the drive-thru as you apprach the intercom always says SORRY WE ARE CLOSED but then they come on and tell you if they have one or more serving of whatever they have left over because they are too lazy to cook more food and want to walk out the door right at 10:30. The staff and their professionalism, I'll just let you experience that on your own. What alley do they hire these people from?!?! DON'T COME HERE LATE AT NIGHT, YOU WILL BE SADLY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what all the other bad reviews are about, but I was here last night and had a pretty pleasant experience! Arrived a little after 7pm and of course I knew it would be bus because for some people if not most this is I guess dinner time? Well I was right because they were BUSY! But as long as you get me in and out in an efficient manner I will never have a complaint. I think the manager was the one who was starting the orders and he greeted everybody that walked through and made sure we were served quickly! My choice was the two item combo with chow mein instead of the rice! Not really a fan of their rice and actually the food in general but I was \"invited\" so.. Yeah anyways the coconut walnut shrimp is so good! Can't remember the chicken dish I selected as my second but that was good as well! I must've had perfect timing! All my dishes were FRESH and being put out as I was ordering! Talk about wining! Not sure I will be back anytime soon but I will if the opportunity presents itself again!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this particular Panda Express in several months. So, imagine my surprise when I most recently visited.  The entire place has been remodeled!  Every aspect of the interior of this location has been freshened up. Because of the remodel, there is markedly more available seating, all while maintaining a nice open feel to it. They've added a wall mounted flat screen television to the dining area at well. While we were there, the television was only being used to display internal advertisements. So, I'm not sure if it's connected to any type of service provider.   One of my favorite additions, however, is at the drink machine. I've mentioned it in another review that I am mildly phobic about touching drink lids. I've been known to throw the top one away just to get to an untainted one. Here, however, they've invested in a lid dispenser. Just open the door, and it automatically grabs one lid just for you.  Aesthetics weren't the only upgrades Panda Express has made. Although the menus is basically the same, there is one very important addition that caught my eye. They now offer Grilled Teriyaki Chicken. This is by far the healthiest option on the menu for anybody looking to maintain some semblance of a healthy diet while you're out and about.  All in all, this is a decent place to stop and eat if you're at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Had this food during the connecting flight. Over the next few hours, I had an upset stomach, bloated and diarrhea. This was the only thing I ate the whole morning. Horrible."}
{"text":"Not yelping the food cause its panda express. Everyone knows what the food is. Ot would ne like a nogmac review. There is no need to review the food.  but the girlfriend is very mad because the lady behind the counter was rude then screwed up her order. and then had an attitude when I tried to get it corrected. then the people after us had to wait. no hi welcome or anything like that. then she proceeds to screw up that order as well. god thing its counter servi ce. then the drive in window clerk has to correct her also.  I really have never seen anything like this. if you cant hear customers im sure there are easier jobs that pay the same."}
{"text":"I've been to Panda Express in Mentor twice. Both times they did not have teriyaki chicken. They were out and it was gonna be a 12 to 13 minute wait.   The manager was rude and did not offer any discount. The food was average at best I would not go their.   Save your money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Panda express.  There's usually a long line when I come here but they always move quickly.  The prices are kind of high but it can't stop me from coming here because it's so tasty and good.  I personally haven't had any issues with customer service so I'll say things are good."}

{"text":"I am not a fan of 2 star reviews, I don't want to hurt a business.  this is a frustrating one, because I love Panda Express.  This Panda Express is more poorly run than any I have been to around the country.  Little things could improve it (like making sure the person at the drive through speaks English).  Cooking the food on time.  When you are running out of Chicken on a regular basis that is just silly.  Once they were out of steamed rice!  How do you do that at Panda?  Whoever is hiring and training is the problem, because you know Panda has good systems.  Slow....Hopefully I will be able to update this with a positive review at some point, because this place is a 3 minute walk from my house."}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 item plate and asked for the chow mien to be put on a separate plate because i am on a low carb diet and i was going to give it to my friend who was with me.  That seemed like a very difficult task for the guy to figure out.  He them gave me a practically non-existent portion of broccoli beef.  I literally saw 2 pieces of meat and 3 broccoli pieces.  Wow.  I didn't say anything but when i got to the register, the manager, (i think), took the plate of chow mien and even as was telling her that it was correct that way, ignored me and threw it back in the pan.  She then wanted to charge me for an extra item.  I explained to her that i had ordered the bigger plate, and she still wanted to charge me for an extra item.  I pointed at the menu board and explained, AGAIN, what I had ordered.  She then got extremely rude. I asked if she could put a little more broccoli in the order and she said shed have to charge me extra.  I asked her to look at how much was there, and she said the guy who dished it was new, but that it would still be extra for a little more.  I was so disgusted with the entire experience, i told her to cancel the order, along with my friends order and we left.  I eat at Panda at least once a week, at other locations, and have never had such anti-customer treatment.  Clerarly they didn't want us there so we left.  I see no reason to go back."}
{"text":"I work in the area so have eaten at this location numerous times.  The location is right across from the Mandalay Bay so due to it's proximity to major hotels it's often very busy which means a longer wait then other fast food joints off the strip.  The staff do their job. Nothing more nothing less. And like most Panda's the food is edible. Nothing spectacular here."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. I was impressed. I thought this would be just another fast chinese food, dingy looking place. It was not. It's bright and cheery and clean. The food is not soaked in overwhelming amounts of sauce, but just enough to give it great flavor. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The servers were very kind and helpful and very patient, and it was very busy, there were at least 3-4 people behind us. We were a little undecided about what we wanted so it took us a little extra time. They were very hospitable. They rung up the order and we decided that we wanted to add some egg rolls to the order, it was no problem, they even asked if we were going to need more sauces (which we did)."}
{"text":"We were craving some Panda so we rolled down to the Rainbow location to get our favorite items.  We apparently came on new employee trading day.  The device was not that of other locations I have went too.  They were disorganized and confused.  They had several employee working the serving line but they were not working together.      We had all order a 3 item combo and o even told the young lady 2 times our item request.  My efforts were in vain as she still managed to mess up our order.  The only good thing is she didn't charge us for the missed item.  We had waited way too long for the order so decided to leave with what they did get right.    The food was good and answered the Panda craving.  For a fast casual place the food is pretty good.  The Teriyaki chicken is one of my favorite along with the honey walnut shrimp.     The next time I have a Panda craving I will go to the Blue Diamond location.  They have better organization and customer service.  On another  note the 3rd item put in the separate container is much smaller portion than the other two.  I am going to stick to the 2 item combo next time as it is a much better deal."}
{"text":"I know what you thinking four stars for Panda Express.  Sure it is not the authentic Asian food you get on Spring Mountain.  But it is cooked fresh and hits the spot.  I don't head out to eat at Panda Express but if we are hungry and in the area the girls just love to get a combo to go.    I usually get my combo with the fried rice and noodles.  Both a pretty tasty addition to the entrees.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp,  Orange Chicken and Teriyaki Chicken are my favorite entrees.  All are really tasty and always satisfy my Asian food craving.    This location is our favorite despite not being the closet one to us.  The other location (S. Rainbow) is ill run and very skimpy on the entrees.  The device was very good and we were in and out in under 10 minutes even though they had to make the orange chicken since it had run out.     If in the area and craving Asian food you can't go wrong with this reasonably priced fast casual place!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! Worst  Panda I've ever been to. Got there at 6:00 pm, the peak dinner time, and I counted 7 entrees empty! When she asked me what I wanted, I asked her when everything else was coming up and in a very snooty attitude she said in three minutes. So I said I wanted two different entrees, and she asked if I wanted to pay for it now? Ummm no idiot, I'll pay for it when it's ready!"}
{"text":"If you like the portion sizes at Panda go to a different Panda Express. The food quality is good but it seems like this location gives much less than others.  They do seem busier than others so maybe managements solution was to give less food to keep up on the demand.  I hate giving Panda anything less than 5 stars but this location needs a reminder of what made everyone love Panda Express to begin with...or just ask for individual sides instead of the meal where they can't short you on a \"meal\""}
{"text":"Always decent. Never great but when you need fast food chinese this is your place."}
{"text":"I'll be amazed if this place is still in business in Mentor next year, without a major corporate intervention.  Even mediocre Chinese/American food can be tolerable, but this stuff was not fit for human consumption.  The fried rice was bland and dry....what they refer to as \"chow mein\", tasted as if we were grazing in a hay field.  I've wondered what hay would taste like; I think I now know.  We ordered potstickers and had to wait because they burnt them, complaining that \"we've never made these before\".  The veggie spring rolls were indescribable as to how crappy they were.  I'm serious, I really have no words.  Someone needs to take charge of this place and properly train these kids and see what's wrong with the food quality here.  I can't believe that as big as this franchise is, that they're all like this one.  Taco Bell is like a 5 star Michelin compared to this place.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Their shrimp walnut full size is 7 pieces of shrimp. Server was a bro and warned me about it beforehand. Now I'm passing it on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick, early dinner and while the staff was quite nice, there were some clear issues with management and communication. I asked for brown rice: not made therefore not an available (nor was it offered to be made) option so I got vegetables. I asked for Shanghai steak (pretty popular item) it was not available and I was told it would be 7 or 8 minutes. I moved on to Orange chicken-not available-will be another couple minutes. I came here specifically for those 3 things and I had to wait--not a big deal but it was a good 15 minute wait. Meh -I'll get over it but when I got home and started eating, the Orange chicken tasted like freezer burn, the vegetables were quite literally raw and cold, and the Shanghai steak was mostly large pieces of mushrooms. The dining area had several full tables and when I walked in there were many people in line as well as a few who came in behind me. This was around 4pm, just the early beginnings of dinner rush.  The staff was very nice and offered  10%  off my meal  as well as a water cup while I waited. It could have just been the time of the day but when I have another Panda craving, this will most likely not be my first location of choice---decision made mostly on the freezer burn because let's be honest, good Orange chicken is worth waiting 15 minutes for.  Edit---4 months later. I went back to see if things have improved (plus it's the closest one to me). No improvements. Had to wait again for the 2 most popular things that could possibly ever have- Orange chicken and rice. I watched the cook pour veggies from a large bag, into a basket, and dunk into the steaming water for less than 20 seconds, pull them out and pour into a server. They were steaming when I got them but quite literally cold when I bit in- at best they were blanched. They also very oddly tasted like freezer burn although I don't imagine they would be freezing their vegetables. The orange chicken wasn't cooked all the way. I mean the chicken was but the batter around it and in between two pieces stuck together was grainy and mushy like I was chewing on paste. Shanghai steak was overcooked and dry unfortunately. I was, again, asked this time if I would like a water cup while I wait.  Again, staff is quite nice but still poorly managed. There were a couple staff members kinda lolly gagging around when it was clearly a very busy time- 5 orders ahead of me (3 of which were waiting just like me) and approx. 5 or 6 people behind me in line. The poor girl serving was by herself and overwhelmed. That should not have had to happen."}
{"text":"We arrived to this location excited because there was no line, yet once we were inside we stood there for about 5 minutes until a woman and her daughter walked in. Two employees rushed over immediately and apparently had no idea we were already waiting a while since one asked \"who was here first?\" I ordered half of what I wanted and was asked if I would like to pay while I wait for the rest of the meal to finish cooking, I ignored it and told the other employee that I had the intention of getting another bigger plate, then I paid. After a couple of minutes my food was ready and handed over to the mother and daughter. Of course they realized the mistake and I went home with the food. The worst part was when I got home and ate, my husbands plate had overcooked steak and shrimp, our wantons were full of oil and my teriyaki was not chopped correctly.  We weren't even offered the sweet and sour sauce for our wantons nor teriyaki for my chicken. Worst experience ever!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this panda express,  but the service is very slow. This particular location is a busy one, I wish they would have more people to accommodate the large crowds and their busy drive-thru. I really enjoy eating at the Panda Express the food here is excellent. I will give them another chance  Thank you for reading my comment."}
{"text":"This location was a joke...me and my girlfriend went here while we were waiting for her cars oil to be changed at the brake Masters down the street. You stand in line like at a cafeteria and the people behind the counter dishing out your not so fresh food can barely speak English, the tray I picked up was sticky and dirty and had some type of half dried syrup on it and it was disgusting.  They served us and did not even give us silverware, or chopsticks to eat with, and the general decor of this restaurant looks like a ghetto Chinese buffet in crack central.  The floors and restaurant in general were D.I.R.T.Y. like Christina Aguilara dirty back in the day before she was a mom!!!! The food tasted like it had been sitting in a pan for 3 hours, and I would NEVER go to this place again, I was surprised I didn't find a finger or a needle or a cockroach in my plate of mushroom chicken with vegetables."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this location . I worked at Panda Express In California for 2 years so I guess my expectations are somewhat of high when visiting . Every time is a great experience for me . Fresh food , friendly staff and always clean . The female manager Primavera, is so nice she takes pride in knowing her customers . I always go in for pot stickers and they make them fresh for me every time . This is the best location in Henderson . I would suggest this location before any other in the valley ."}
{"text":"one amazing manager! micheal! great job! we had a bad experience one time an micheal! knocked it out of the park,he is so fun to watch while he cooks....thank you so very much panda!"}
{"text":"usually the go-to place for me and my boyfriend. with the free entree coupon got from last visit, we share one 3 entree box for $7.22...pretty good deal at college level when you don't have much $$ haha"}
{"text":"Rush rush  to  order, Dirty tables, to many onions, only one cook working his ass off.  Hire some help."}
{"text":"My 2 stars is strictly based on service. If you are planning on coming to this Panda you should make it soon. From the looks of things, it will be closing soon. One woman working the front, another guy cooking while a third employee sits in the lobby sleeping. A line out the door and together they could only manage about 5-7 minutes per customer from \"Hi\" to \"thanks, come again.\"  Luckily I had my food in just under 20 minutes. The poor people that were 5 behind me are still waiting in line and I am about finished with my meal.   It was bad enough when they got rid of Spicy Egg Plant Tofu. But if you are going to get rid of a great dish you better back it up with legendary service.   Sorry Panda, you are missing it. You are slowly moving into Quiznos territory."}
{"text":"I finally decided to write to Panda Corp to express my displeasure with the smaller containers and now the price increase and a business practice of not filling the containers up.   I went through their whole process and tried to submit it and big surprise!! I wouldn't go through.  Oh well, I loved their food my lunchtime favorite is no more."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero... I would... came in a month ago, and ordered chow me in, orange chicken, and teriyaki chicken.... long story short... after a long wait I got home to find out I had chow me in, and a small portion of teriyaki chicken, and no orange chicken, no teriyaki sauce, and no fortune cookie... fast forward to tonight, ordered the same thing... they gave me a decent size of teriyaki chicken, and they remembered the orange chicken... and practically had to beg them for the teriyaki sauce, and a fortune cookie, and even at that I got a very rude look from the person behind the counter... I will never be stepping foot back into this location ever again... until they get their act together"}
{"text":"Okay! This needs an update. I knew it was too good to be true. Well I came and got another order from this location. And was so surprise to what the new employee did \" he weighed all my food\" then took some away? Like what?!?!   I didn't sat anything to be respectful but to weigh food in front of you and be taken away is just ridiculous. I probably ate atleast twice a month here especially for easy Asian cravings. Until they fix this I won't be going to this place anymore. I would rather go somewhere else.  P.S the new guys name is Jonathan. Yeap. Sorry. That's just not appropriate. Would u want me to serve you then take just a piece of that food cause it more than what the weigh says?  Ughhh."}
{"text":"This used to be a good location to get decent Panda Express. The last three times we went to this location they have messed up our food. All we ask is they give us a little Teriyaki Sauce on the Teriyaki Chicken and a small amount on the rice. They failed to comprehend this and they leave the sauce off the food. So, this time my wife ordered it to go. She said she wanted the sauce on the side. Our hope was that we could put it on exactly how we like it. When she got home...no sauce  in the bag and none on the food. The chicken was dry and the rice was too.   I made a call and asked the person who answered (Christine) if I could speak to the manager. She told me the manager called in sick. So I asked if I could speak to the person in charge. She said yes...then hung up on me. I repeated this call 5 more times. The 2nd time she stated she was the person in charge...and again hang up on me. If the way they handle customer service is to hang up on people and not give good quality food, then it is time to move on to a better restaurant for now on.   I plan to follow up with their management tomorrow and I am sending this information to their corporate office. This is their third strike and they have proven they don't care about quality or customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible location been here 3 times and won't come back again! the only reason why I come to this location is because it's down the street. The first time I had an incident was because I had got frozen honey walnut shrimp and broke a chipped tooth"}
{"text":"Just your typical Panda Express. Clean? sure. Quick and speedy service? not so much. The lady was nice sure but the fact that she was the only lady that was running both the food line and cash register you would think she was put down the phone. The whole time we were ordering she was speaking spanish to someone on the telephone. Kind of irritating. Idk if it was a personal call or what, but she could not put down the phone even when three other people were in line behind us. The lady with her two kids behind us split, and me and my friend would have too but we decided to wait it out because we were starving and really wanted to try their new surf and turf and fried brown rice which was awesome for it being panda express. Anyways, nothing spectacular but it will do for my panda fix."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and quick Chinese fix.  I had Orange Chicken and Bacon.  Bacon makes me happy.  I hit the place at six p.m. - kids eat free so place was busy, thus the food was fresh.  Also Manager was nice enough to ask how my meal was."}
{"text":"Had our food sitting on the counter for at least 10 minutes, and did not complete our order. Horrible service. They had about $100 of revenue walk out the door."}
{"text":"Smallest pieces of chicken I have ever seen and dry. Salad was good though. I won't go back. I can find better chicken elsewhere."}
{"text":"Returning to the U.S. this year, but this time spending a week in Las Vegas, I was looking forward to revisiting one of the many Panda Express restaurants on The a Strip. So after a 10,5 hour flight from the UK, checkin, relaxing by the pool, and short exploration of some of the other hotels on The Strip, like Aria, I was ready for some Chinese takeaway! From my visit to Florida, I am a big fan of Panda Express, especially their Orange Chicken, and after such a long and busy day, all I wanted was a good old fashioned takeaway.   Close to our hotel (MGM Grand) was a Food Court at Showcase Mall with several food outlets like Wendy's, Subway, Del Taco and of course, PANDA EXPRESS. Ordering a Plate, which consists of two entrees and a side, I could only think about having Chow Mein Noodles with Orange Chicken and Sweetfire Chicken Breast. It was incredible. Everything I had been craving for! Delicious! Of course I shared the dish with my girlfriend, and after such a day, it was the perfect food to end it with.  The food gets FIVE stars without a doubt, but the food court itself wasn't the best location and it smelled like dirty water. Next time, I will just get the food to takeaway, or visit another Panda Express in one of the nearby locations.  Find this and other reviews on mcrphil.blogspot.co.uk"}
{"text":"I hate coming to this location and not sure why I came again today. The last several times I have had to wait almost 20 minutes because they have nothing made. Today I am at 22 minutes and still waiting. If I wanted to wait for my Chinese I would go to a restaurant. There are about 8 people waiting for food. Also they made half of my order while waiting on the rest so that will probably be cold. I will not be back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. Terrible terrible terrible service. The girl at the drive through looks like she hates everyone and everything. No hello no one second no goodbye. Literally she didn't even tell me the amount I had to ask her twice. Needless to say I will not be going back there"}
{"text":"Not great, not bad, it's Panda Express. Only thing bad I can say is the typical \"Hurry up and order\" hustle that the employees lay on you. It goes like this- \"Give me the Orange Chicken.OK WHAT ELSE?Uhhhh, do you have steamed vegetables?FIVE MINUTES, WHAT ELSE? 5 minutes what?IT TAKES 5 MINUTES. 5 minutes to make?YES, WHAT ELSE? Ok, give me the Firecracker Chicken.OK WHAT ELSE?And the steamed vegetables.OK WHAT ELSE?\"  Not a minute to consider your thoughts. Every location is like this. WHAT ELSE, WHAT ELSE, WHAT ELSE. To be fair, the food is fresh and crisp about 90% of the time, more than you can say than most chinese places... but that's not saying much."}
{"text":"Terrible no beef ready and cooks have no urgency at all to have food ready, they sit back and make u wait with a attitude never go to that location again"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for lunch, plenty of choices but I am always eat Orange Chicken."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express.  My friends love Panda Express.  My Grandkids really love Panda Express so obviously, I eat a lot of Panda Express.  Well, this is the best location by far.  The owner, Fawzi runs a great business and a tight ship.  He is extremely friendly and very community oriented.  He supports numerous school programs and social events in the area.  Fawzi and his restaurant are an asset to the City of Surprise and the surrounding neighborhoods.  The staff is friendly and very responsive.  The food is always fresh and always being replenished.  They give out tons of samples so you can try something new every time.  Make sure to stop in at this Panda Express any time you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is the BEST location by far. I will literally drive farther just to come to this one. They are so friendly and welcoming. Portions are generous. Food is how to expect. I mean, it doesn't compare to restaurant quality oriental food but it's good. Better than mcdonalds that's for sure. I really like it and will continue I come back. They are so nice her that I come almost 3 to 4 times a week!!"}
{"text":"Honestly I REALLY don't like this location. I've never had a positive experience here. I eat at other locations at least a couple of times in the week and I won't go to this one anymore. The portions are skimpy compared to other locations. They are not friendly in the least. And make me feel like I'm being a burden (since I'm ordering a large order to go.) I'm more than happy to let others go in front, but even when I'm the only one in there I feel like I'm bothering them. The locations on 75th and bell and 59th and the 101 are my go to locations. Always so friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Mom's favorite is the honey walnut shrimp and the food here is always fresh"}
{"text":"when I'm in the mood for fake Chinese food this is the place to go.  Unfortunately they no longer serve pork so the char siu is no longer on the menu.  So disappointed about that.  i'm not sure why they no longer sell it because the employees don't seem to know themselves.  I do love the fact they offer free samples so you can see if you will like it before you order it.  I do wish the prices was a little cheaper but you can get 2 meals out of a 2 item combo.  Other than the no park, they seem to have good customer service and are very friendly which is a plus."}
{"text":"I appreciate that they took the time to listen to me and then repeat my order back! And everything was in the bag! And I loved that the customer service agent was friendly and helpful! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Food was old...mushy. Manager didn't seem to really care. My stomach has been a mess since and I couldn't even eat half of the food...yuck!!!"}
{"text":"The first time we were here the service was great. Everyone greeted us and made sure we were satisfied with our orders which made us actually order a lot more food than we even needed. THIS time around was the complete opposite. The older Hispanic woman serving the food had the worst attitude and acted like she hated her job. I ordered the 2 combo plate and shrimp was one of the entrees and she gave me about 4 pieces and still charged me extra for it. We each asked for one sample of a dish because we had never tried it and she huffed and seemed absolutely miserable about having to help us with that. She didn't offer chopsticks or any hot mustard so we stood around waiting for another employee in the back who was just walking around not cooking anything to help us and he just stared at us and never approached us asking if we needed help even though we called out to him. We ended up having to go around the counter to grab our own hot mustard packets. We ordered it to go so we didn't have to be there any longer than we absolutely had to be. TBH this makes us never want to come back and we regret spending the $17 we did just now. Crappy experience."}
{"text":"Staff is very unfriendly. They were in such a rush to get us through the line. If you said anything to them they acted like you were such a bother.  If I could not give a star I would, because this store doesn't deserve it."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda I've ever been to! I ordered a Kung Pao Chicken bowl with chow mein & a cup of H2O. They gave me rice in the bowl. Luckily, I dined in and was able to correct my order. They really bombard you with mundane questions at check out...would you like any egg rolls? to make a donation to...? I had to tell them 3x \"just the bowl and water!\" Oh, and my chicken bowl had exactly 2 small pieces of chicken in it. $6+ dollars for some luke warm noodles and vegetables. Complete rip off. I complained and they shrugged me off. Never going back."}
{"text":"GOOD LOCATION and SERVICE Fast, simple, and easy. Prices are a bit cheaper due to the location being farther from the strip. Barely any people as well.  No line when we got there so we ordered right away and got our food. Lady packed our box really full.   Best deal is bigger plate."}
{"text":"Something about this location makes a 10 minute transaction drawn out to 30. The employees this location have a hard time multi-tasking with taking an order and fulfilling said order. Save yourself some time and the irritation by going to another location."}
{"text":"Super hot in here. I don't appreciate a dining area where I am slowly sweating. I wasn't the only one who thought so.   Next, I ordered the 2 item combo: fried rice, honey sesame chicken and kung pao chicken. Had to take it back because there was a big nasty HAIR in my food. Luckily I pulled it off of my fork instead of out of my mouth. They replaced my meal, but that was so nasty I lost my appetite. I guess that's what I get for going to Panda Express and expecting more.  Cognitive Therapy would tell me to alter my expectations and thus avoid future disappointment.   Common sense tells me just don't eat here anymore."}
{"text":"Food was Good, customer service is OK.. it's a nice break from the buffets on the strip, and a heck of a lot cheaper too!"}
{"text":"Good and clean place, always same quality and service. I had black pepper chicken and mushroom chicken over half chow mein and half fried rice. There were no line and they are open 10:30 am not like all others opens at 11 am"}
{"text":"Don't come if you like brown rice because if your a customer that likes brown rice they don't care about you. When they run out tough luck."}
{"text":"I go to panda about 2 to 3 times a week.the staff is always kind and nice with big smiles.and the store is the cleanest ive ever been in...good job panda"}
{"text":"I decided to do a little comparison (with a place in the food court).  I arrived around 8:30 PM.   Panda Express is kind of like an Asian version of Chipotle.   They have different combo meals.   I decided to get 2 meats, fried rice, and an egg roll.  I also purchased a bottle of water.  Meats: - Orange Chicken - Grilled Chicken (this was suppose to come with a sauce but I decided not to get the sauce - I thought the Orange Chicken was enough)  The cost was a little over $10.  The food had great flavor.     Please note that this recently opened up.    All and all - I will be back."}
{"text":"These stupid idiots! I went here and I stood at the counter while the dummy 1 and dummy 2 sat there gossiping. I ask  dumb ass 1 ( Aracely) if they were making anything fresh, seeing that it was only around 8:15 pm   So I ask what the wait time is and dummy 1 says the wait time is five minutes. She then proceeds to ask the next Black who comes in if we were paying together. Really dumb ass! So here I am waiting, after 10 minutes, I ask how much longer it's going to be. This dummy asked the cook and he says 5 minutes! Really another 5 minutes...I decided to leave so I didn't slap this idiot across the face with a spring roll that I didn't pay for.  You better believe I'm reporting this entire experience. My time was wasted and not once did this chicken head apologize."}
{"text":"Usually I despise all Panda Express locations...but not eating them for a long while, my meal was actually pretty good! They get 3 stars because the girl that was the cashier was on a personal call while I paid discussing how she didn't know what the hell was going on because they screwed up her check lol she never said a word to me as I paid."}
{"text":"I only got food here twice.  Chow main was burned both times but the rest of the food was ok.  Employees are nice and courteous."}
{"text":"The few times I have eaten here the food tasted alright. Nothing horrible and nothing great either. They do offer to let you try samples prior to placing your order, but they are pretty stingy when it comes to giving you  certain items, particularly chow mien, but they pack on the meat which I'm not a huge fan of. After I ate here last night I awoke very sick, the whole nine. It turns out I have food poisoning. Based on this, I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered my food for the drive-thru they said pull it to the side while we cook your Kung Pao had to wait 20 minutes from time I paid until order brought to my car.  Not acceptable! !!"}
{"text":"Fast drive through lines, ice cold food... no reason for cold food during a dinner rush, it should all be fresh."}
{"text":"This is just quick Chinese like food.  I had a craving for this at 930 on a Sunday.  They opened at 20 so everything was super fresh!!!  Satisfied my craving so all is good."}
{"text":"I must say that this visit was the best so far..   The line was long but the young lady working the rice station was polite and efficient.   The line was hot and fresh and each person working was quick and professional."}
{"text":"Went the other day to get lunch and unfortunately had to deal with kenia. Asked for the Shanghai beef she said it would be 6mins said that was fine she rolled her eyes and huffed. She informed me that it was an extra charge again said that was fine. And again got the same attitude. When the food finally arrived I was checking the bag for sauces and again in her oh so pleasant attitude informed me it was there. Since I was already tired of dealing with miss I hate my job lady I left, only to find out no soy sauce and no teriyaki sauce for the chicken. Now I called and spoke to the Assistant manager and she informed me she is still training the un pleasant person. I guess kenia doesn't realize that with out customers you have no job!!!!  And if you are still in training you might want to train on being a nicer person!!!!"}
{"text":"Before you eat here at panda look at pictures from my experience.  By the way, I brought it to there attention after I seen what was on my plate and, the server comes out and says I'm sorry, would you like another plate of the same?  WTF??!!  Yea  buddy, how about on the same plate!!  Idiot.   Never again.  Gotta let the health department know now beings how nobody wants to take my info.  I'm not looking for a \"free meal\".  Just want them to know how there so called restaurants run.  ( like we didn't already know )."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  There was nobody in line except my wife and I, we were literally ignored for almost 5 minutes just standing there waiting. I finally asked one of the 2 girls working the serving area if anyone was going to help us, she got defensive and began to tell me that they were working to fill online orders first, she sounded bothered that I even asked who was going to help us.  We go here because it's convenient to we're we live, but being treated like they don't even see us standing there for 5 minutes turns the experience into an inconvenience, it's sad that we have to feel like we're bothering the staff when simply asking to be helped.  Get it together Panda."}
{"text":"This is the second time they forgot to put the teriyaki chicken sauce in the bag after requesting it on the side, and they hold there orange chicken for to long gets hard."}
{"text":"I have a great time with my friends while working on the presentation. The food and the customer service are awesome. In today economic challenges, there is no doubt hardworking college students face difficulties generating more revenues in order to survived.  My group and I recommend this restaurant to those of you living on a tight budget."}
{"text":"They tried to CHARITY SHAME me!!! I even paid by card!  \"Do you want to donate the 97 cents?\" - Wait what??  Shame on you! That's what donation boxes are for, and you had one!!!  DO NOT CHARITY SHAME!!! DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"While there are times the food is a little stale and dry, most of the time it is fresh and yummy. What trumps the food most of the time is the service. The workers here are very friendly and fast. Plus, their outside speaker works VERY well. I never have to repeat myself and they always get my order right. They usually don't have specials but they do have new menu items on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Bruh! This place is great. Even if you not a big fan of the food like me but every once in a while, come down for the comedy and entertainment of CJ as he builds orders for the customers."}
{"text":"The smell of this place is delicious if you're ever near college avenue.  The reason it gets 3 stars is that that food is sometimes served lukewarm, which is quite important when it's meat.  Maybe not enough individuals visit this location to circulate the food through..."}
{"text":"They said there temporarily only accepting debit and credit cards!!! What business doesn't except cash that's ridiculous"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever!  They can't seem to keep enough food in the hot tables.  You are always seeming to have to wait on food to be cooked. It doesn't matter what time of the day or nite you go there.  Truthfully, I shouldn't even give it 1 star.  Have given several chances but dont believe we will be going back there, we will drive the distance to another store."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express and it's just one of those places that I don't ever have to look at the menu before ordering. The two item combo with chow-main, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli is my constant order. I almost forgot their tropical ice tea, which is magical in itself.   At this location, I have never had a bad experience. There can be a little wait around dinner time, but they are always cooking more food, so at least it is fresh. I have also been to other locations where I feel like the use way to much sauce, but I have never had that problem at this location.   If you are on your way home from work and looking for a quick easy dinner solution, or out for a quick lunch and want something other then a burger, this may be your spot."}
{"text":"Let's be fair, it's a Chinese take out and some eat-in if you so choose. So comparing against other fast food, this is not bad. It's clean and the food is always fresh.   And let's also be honest, East side of Cleveland, exccluding Asia town, has horrible Chinese food choices. So a Panda Express, as pathetic as it sounds, is bring up the curve on the Chinese food scale here. I'm from Chicago area and the sight of this new Panda brought Joy because I've been sick of the mystery brown sauce from all the other Chinese joints.  Now the downside is that the staff is slow but we have to blame the customers too for being indecisive. I have been visiting here many times and still bump into first timers."}
{"text":"This Panda is nearest to my work, but Panda Express is getting ridiculous! Personally the franchise should get the one star, for one reason alone. They're giving you less food, as their prices go up. The to-go plate is much smaller, not sure about the regular plate, but I'm not going back. Sorry panda :("}
{"text":"Customer service contacted me with a satisfactory message so I'm updating my review from one to three stars."}
{"text":"Hello, I'm a huge Panda lover. I usually get 1 to go, half white rice, half mixed veggies and double on the teriyaki chicken with sauce on the side.   Today, I imagined my delicious meal, went in and ordered the usual. As I was enjoying my delicious meal, I glance down at my mixed veggies.  A BLACK LONG HAIR, was nicely wrapped around a piece of lettuce. My stomach turned and I instantly wanted all that food out of my stomach. I didn't puke, but I politely asked for a refund and swear to NEVER NEVER eat at that location.  I will consider if I will ever eat at a panda again, just nasty, YUK!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a Panda bowl with chow mein and broccoli beef, pretty standard for Panda Express. Only problem I had was with the broccoli not being cooked enough it looked and tasted like they threw it in last minute.     Overall restaurant was clean, fast, with very friendly staff and good portions he could barely put the lid on. : )"}
{"text":"Today, I was rushing from one place to another and needed some fast food.  Not feeling like a burger, I thought that Panda Express sounded convenient.  I was not disappointed though at the same time, the meal was not a gourmet one either.  There was only one person working the register while at the same time serving food so there was a bit of a wait (and the staff member was a bit flustered with much going on at once).  I am guessing that another staff member was on a break as there was a second person there by the time I left.  The restaurant was also kept quite clean though it appeared that the forks and napkins needed some restocking.    The food, however, was fresh and as tasty as I had hoped it would be.  I got a two-item combo with fried rice, beef & broccoli, and string bean chicken.  I also added on a chicken egg roll.  The restaurant had several families, a few people on their own, and a couple all also eating, and it appeared that everyone else was also pleased with their meals."}
{"text":"Never seem to have enough food prepared People on break in the middle of a rush Cook seems pissed to have to constantly be making food Talin (?) Does NOT know how to make eye contact or properly communicate to be heard Poor cashier is having to FINISH up EVERY order, DON'T complain about waiting 25 min for fast food (they did give u a free small beverage while you wait for them to finish) Talin will just glare at you and whisper jokes to his co workers.... did i mention there is a line OUT the door and stacks of orders waiting on food to be fixed... i guess spending $25 for dinner, waiting 25 min & being made to feel YOU are the problem.... WOW!!"}
{"text":"First time I went there the food just just plain gross. I have been to other Panda Express locations and it was good. So I decided to give it another try today and it sure smelled good. So I went through the drive thru and waited 4 min before taking my order while people were behind me. Then when I finally ordered I waited behind s guy who had to be waiting at least 15 min for his food. I listened to an entire inning of baseball. So eventually I got my food and took it home. I ordered the orange chicken. And beef broccoli. The chicken was good and the beef and broccoli... well they only game me broccoli... no beef. Well wait a second. I had a small piece. Sorry I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to work down the street from this Panda and the food is consistently good as is the service.  Better than the locations closer to my house.  Don't know why the rating is as low as it is...  The food is always fresh. The orange chicken, for instance, is always crispy.  Never tastes like the food has been sitting there."}
{"text":"Seriously they need some customer service refreshment class or something to make them understand not to be rude I know sometimes people have a bad day but to be rude because you can ? Not good she was probably the manger because she was wearing a blue polo when everyone else was wearing red."}
{"text":"Only location to reduce their food servings to about half of what every other Panda Express serves and still charge the same price. Cheap management trying to save every single penny they can. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This restaurant provides a military discount, customer requests for fresh product, and a clean both upfront and back of the house. Manager works just as hard if not harder than the servers/cooks. My family frequents this restaurant often...."}
{"text":"I love panda but I can't eat where none of the employees don't wear gloves. They went from handling money to working with food. No one had nets its just gross.   Never again"}
{"text":"About 6:30 pm felt like good Chinese Food .... I have been to other Panda Restaurants and they are pretty good .... this location was out of Beef & Broccoli ... Orange Chicken ... Chow Mein ... and a 10 minute wait for Chicken Teriyaki ... ordered a 3 item combo from (Cookie) their employee ... very rude and could care less about the lack of food prepared or customers waiting .... I have called Corporate in California to let them know about this locale .... NO MORE ...  ADIOS PANDA!"}
{"text":"I've never experienced this before, but I'm just going to let you be the judge:  I am starting to watch/count my calorie load, especially when I am eating out.  American Chinese is famous for huge calorie loads in the sauces and fried treatments, so I thought I would split the middle and order a brown steamed rice with broccoli and beef.  Well, I asked the young lady behind the counter for the calorie count chart and she quickly said she would have to ask someone. No problem and expected...but what happened next was not:  She walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me.  The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! \"Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?\" I asked. She looked back and asked where. \"There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim.\" \"Yes\". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. \"No,\" she replied. \"My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me.\" She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Mr. Omar Richard has excellent customer service, very friendly and upbeat. The lady who took my order was very polite and friendly (I didn't catch her name) I give 5 stars to this duo; keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Panda Express location. Each time I come to this location, it's always a good experience! The employees are very friendly and the drive through is quick."}
{"text":"Have always got fast, tasty and quality service from this location. The drive thru moves quickly and food has always been tasty.  Customer service is great and the orders are filled error free.  One of this chains best locations."}
{"text":"This location is terrible and not even worthy of 1 star. No sauce on teriyaki chicken and burnt egg rolls. I called and asked for a manager and the employee who answered the phone Christopher claimed himself to be the manager.  I informed him that they forgot to put teriyaki sauce on the chicken or in the bag and he said that's not our problem you should check bag before you leave.  I mean this guy didn't even apologize or did anything about it and just said next time check your bag that's the best advice he give. Done with Panda Express and the unprofessional manager Christopher."}
{"text":"The portion is a bit small not like before, the fried rice got even smaller and the noodle too. The egg rolls are now half the size and cost more but it composite it with a great taste."}
{"text":"Well ...you been to one Panda Express you've been to them all.  It serves a purpose of getting a healthy plateful of fair chinese fare!   So there! :)"}
{"text":"Panda Express, extremely convenient, hardly healthy but delicious American Chinese food, brought to you by an american corporation near you :-)  So this location is across the street from my place and I must say it is delicious but extremely unhealthy. The portions are large, the pricing is competitive, and the space is very clean/ well-maintained I've never felt that the service is anything but decent. Recommended for fast eats, casual minded guest.  Also their cup sizes are hysterical check out my photo!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly tired of this place, in fact tired with Panda. I always look before I order and the food looks sad, most times. What can I say. It is what it is. Not the best place for dinner or lunch, but it does fill up for less then $10"}
{"text":"After a long week and winding down my wife and I decided to stop by and grab something quick to take home. We walked in at 9:30 pm and several other customers walked in afterwards. I asked for half noodles & half rice. They were out of rice and had to wait for more rice to be cooked. Asked for two sides, Fire chicken, I was told they are out of it, I asked for teriyaki chicken, I was told they are out of it after looking to to see what was left there were only a few items to choose from. I asked it they were making  fresh items and was told No! What I see it all they have left. I asked to speak to the manager and was told a manager was not in today. This is probably why the service was so Horrible, the few items left was not fresh. I asked the young kid if he had egg rolls. I was told all they had left were  spring rolls mixed in with the cheese crab puffs. I asked if they were fresh, he shook his head No! Now mind you there were about seven customers behind me @ 9:35 pm.  After spending 23.00 of left over food I can tell you I will not be returning to Panda Express store 778 101st and McDowell. I advised everyone if you want fresh listed entrees as advertise STAY AWAY you will not be getting what you paid for. No one seem to care there were customers in line. They were more concern about closing and piling empty food trays off the serving line. This was the worst service I have ever experienced in dining out. BEWARE, they don't care and apparently the store manager doesn't care either that is why he/she was not there."}
{"text":"Very very rude worker!!! Her name is robin. I requested entree and she  gave me attitude that they are going to have to make more!! She literally rolled her eyes at me!!! If she doesn't want to satisfy customer than she should go work at a different profession. Major attitude ..."}
{"text":"This Panda Express franchise is the worst ever! How can one mess up the food. Went to the drive thru. Got home, mandarin chicken grilled had no sauce (we requested sauce on the side), they run out of paper plates (WHAT?) and the fried rice, how can one mess up fried rice. You guys need new management cause the one you have right now is not doing the job well! Never again, thanks for there are other Panda's around town."}
{"text":"People just like to go and rant about only the negative things, this is like any other typical Panda Express, been going here awhile now and never had any problems with anything, also always receive friendly service. And if they take awhile to remake an item that ran out be patient cause at least you know they're cooking it fresh and not just microwaving frozen food   FYI IF THEY'RE BUSY DONT BE RUDE AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WAIT... It's literally the McDonald of Chinese food in America lol stop expecting so much for the amount you're willing to pay"}
{"text":"Great serving portions.  Fast service but hooters takes up parking."}
{"text":"take it to go and they give you a ton! sometimes something as simple as panda tastes so good in such a fancy place as VEGAS."}
{"text":"It's simple, white rice and orange chicken. EVERY piece of orange chicken is rock hard and rice is extremely dry. Not happy, kind of a joke to wait in line during the busiest time when the food should be freshest to get this:   Ps. Can't even get my fork into the chicken without the fork bending 0 Stars"}
{"text":"Tasty! I've been through this drive through about 3 times, and they are usually quick and fresh. I always get their teriyaki chicken with lo mien and it never disappoints. Super tasty and speedy service!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with our service today. We ordered food for 60 people a few days ago, so they would have time to prepare our order and have it ready for a specific time today. We noted that we needed plates, napkins, serving spoons, and different sauces.  Went to pick up the food, we got there early just to be safe in case they were finished preparing it early. Well.... they weren't. They were just preparing our order when we arrived 15 minutes before, and we had a really big order. It was an hour later that we got our food, and there were hungry people waiting on us and the food. We were in such a rush to get back, we didn't check to see if they had thrown everything in, just trusted they had since they needed extra time to prepare our order. We shouldn't have assumed, because when we got back, there were 20 plates, no serving spoons, a ton of napkins, no forks or any cutlery, and no sauces like we had specifically asked for. It was extremely frustrating to me and the other 40 people that had to go without lunch due to the fact we only got plates for 20 people. And on top of all that, we had to use the microwave to heat all the food up because it was cold upon arrival, and even then it was disgusting because they had burnt the food as well.  Extremely disappointed, especially because we had payed close to $500 for all of the food we had ordered. I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone, and they have lost a very big customer."}
{"text":"Panda express is a decent Chinese fast food. But the reason I am giving this particular location 4 stars is because of an employee. His name is Marcos. We were there on only his second day of employment but he stood out so superior, I had to write about him. This guy was so friendly, so willing to assist and happy to be there. He offered other items to up sell us without seeming like he was trying to hard. He had a huge smile the whole time he waited on us. I really hope the management at P.E. Company take a hard look at this kid. He needs to go far......fast! Great job Marcos! We will be back because of you."}
{"text":"As with many chains, this Panda Express location doesn't have a lot to add to.  However, the food was tasty (mmm... MSG), the service was solid, and the interior was clean."}
{"text":"They like to close up early and stop serving certain stuff. I wish they'd just make more."}
{"text":"First time customer. Ordered an entree and the three cream cheese rangoon side by the drive thru. Should have checked my order before I left. No rangoon. Not a very good first impression for a new place in town folks. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken bowl with the side being steamed rice. The bowl was FULL of rice with a smattering of the entree on top. I had asked to see if it could be made mild. I was told rather sharply \"NO, and it's very spicy\". So I took it anyway. It is very spicy. Obviously drive thru food is made in advance and held in a warmer. Based upon the food and service I won't go back. Too bad because it's close to me."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in here because of her past experience of P.E. at a Texas location.  The prices are ok but the chicken was entirely overcooked.  You couldn't tell the difference between the beef and chicken, they looked so alike.  The staff was stepping all over each other.  We got there for lunch around 12:30am and they were already out of plates.  There was so much repetitive yelling for missing food to the chef.  We saw food displays for food that wasn't even cooked yet.  The poor lady in front of us had to literally wait 15 minutes to get her refund for her over cooked food because her kids didn't like it.  It was all over the place.  I've worked food retail and know how crazy the lunch rush can be but c'mon.  At least the shrimp was cooked fine."}
{"text":"Seriously not feeling the vibe :(  So I came in to panda and everything was good until they gave me my food. Once they gave me my food the chow mein was too dry and the orange chicken was way to sour, I mean I love panda express but not this one that I went too, which is a bummer, but seriously don't come here"}
{"text":"So I'm here ordering my food threw the drive threw and I ask the lady to please give me broccoli but I like the broccoli from the ( beef and broccoli mixture ) I just wanted a few pieces from that beef and broccoli mixture without the beef and when I pulled up she told me ( dont go around saying that at every Panda Express because we can't do that for you we have recipes  to follow ) and she said it with an attitude .... her name is GEMMA. And she is also very bland threw the intercom .... as you order your food she stays quiet so you don't know if this bimbo is getting your order or not .... she sits there hella quiet ..... RUDE no wonder she works at panda she would never be able to work in the casinos with an attitude like that . Hope someone talks to her about that after this review about her . SMH  not coming back here at this hour again to see and order threw her again."}
{"text":"This is the 5th time in a three month period that the soda machine was not working. WHY?"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have never had a problem. But this time I went i had the worst experience. First off we were there like 2 in a half hours before they closed but it was like they were already closing down. The girl there was helping us and she seemed like she didn't want to be there, very rude. She didn't tell us that it was going to take awhile and just told us to sit down until it was ready. She didn't tell the cook to cook our food until 5 mins sitting there and argued with the cook about it. There was a big bucket of cleaning chemicals and a dirty napkin where the guest are walking. She came around the counter and was cleaning the inside glass where the food is with the dirty rag and chemicals which was disgusting. Than she leaves it there and starts serving my plates. She didn't wash her hands. And she put the chicken in the wrong plate so she decided to scoop it into the other plate. We asked for the manager and the manager told us there was nothing to do sense it already happened and that he was sorry. He seemed to young to be in charge and told us the only thing he could do was serve us new plates but we would have to wait for it. He gave us a free entree coupon but I don't know if we'd ever go to this place again or at least this location. They don't use gloves and do things like that when serving food. That's disgusting, all I'm saying is really watch your food when you're there."}
{"text":"Will not come to this panda ever again... Shockingly, it rained in Vegas... Very rare. So, once my boyfriend and I walked in here, it was at least 100 degrees in the food court! We made the mistake by staying.. We ordered our food and sat down. After about maybe 7 minutes of sitting there, I had to get up and ask the lady for a box, because it was extremely hot in the food court.. It's sad how I was just stopping for lunch before I continued my shopping on the same side of the road on the strip! I had to walk across the street to my hotel room to eat my meal. She said after it rained, it just got really hot in there. My ice in my drink, was pretty much all melted. I asked her for a refill, and tried charging me! Don't charge me for a drink I bought 7 minutes ago, and it's ice is melted already... Lol 53 cents for a refill after spending almost around $20 for two people to eat there, when my food wasn't even hot, and was a little soggy from the heat inside the court.. All of the other restaurants inside the food court had free refills, I believe... Probably will never come back to this panda express next time I vacation in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Panda Express has great food, but this restaurant has bad customer service. Girl who served us (Shali) seemed to be in a rush (it was 8:45pm). As she served our rice and noodles she asked what 2 entrees we wanted. We still didn't know and wanted to see the other entrees they had down the line. She seemed eager and asked two more times what our 2 entrees would be. We told her again that we didn't know. She didn't seem friendly at all and like she just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Purchased my food here about 30 minutes before the mall closed, using my credit card. Approximately 40 minutes later an additional, unauthorised charge for a larger amount was billed to my account.  Reported to my bank. Also called them to let them know someone on that evening shift must be submitting fraudulent credit card charges and likely skimming from the till.  Disappoint I will never go here again, as a fundamental trust was violated."}
{"text":"The food always seems like it's old and leftover no matter what time of the day you go there. It seems to have a lot less flavor than the other establishments."}
{"text":"Quite annoying. Our company orders catering regularly from this panda and they can't seem to remember the paper plates on multiple occasions and this round they forgot the teriyaki and sweet and sour sauce too. Oh and they were late. It's fun telling 70 plus people waiting in line they have to wait another 10-20 minutes till we actually get plates while the food gets cold and their work waits."}
{"text":"It's never busy but they have a steady flow. food is as good as any other panda. Its freshly cooked and taste  like it should. I love wontons. It's really clean and inviting. The workers are fast and friendly. Great when you don't want to cook but don't want a burger."}
{"text":"This place is alright except for the fact that I'm always finding hair in my food. Ever heard of hairnets? Service is slow too. Boo."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly service! But the address is right. But when I click on the directions it tried sending me into a gated community???"}
{"text":"Noodles are hard with zero flavor. Food is always cold. The drink station \ utensil area, always a filthy mess. My husband and I tried three different times. Same experience each time. We wont be back!"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, tasted like normal Panda Express. The service was fast, the food was decent. I've gone multiple times."}
{"text":"Good, but wish the food was less sugary. Wish they had egg plant and better vegetable options."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with this location. We ordered online to take out for a birthday party. We were told it would be about an hour, and showed up a few minutes early. Much to the dismay of all of the patrons in line, when we arrived to pick up our order, everything was put on hold to dish up our chow. We didn't realize we were basically taking cuts in front of everyone else, as we just went to the area that said \"online order pick up.\" I'm still not really sure why there was a need to order ahead of time, if they were just going to dish it up upon our arrival. None of the people in line were too upset, which was a surprise. Had the shoe been on the other foot, I may have been a little upset. We were offered complimentary sodas while we waited on one last item to be prepared. The food was good and there was more then enough, with plenty left over. At about six dollars a head (excluding beverages), it was perfect for the party. Nothing to really warrant a jump to four stars, but I would not hesitate to return to this location."}
{"text":"I came to get 4 bowls. While we were waiting they were refilling the chow mein to the point where it was overflowing. There was only a 3/4 spoonful of vegetables left. When I asked for vegetables I was told that I would have to wait 5 minutes. I didn't have 5 minutes to wait. I couldn't understand how the channel name is overflowing yet there are no vegetables made. I was told that because they get old fast and a lot of people don't buy them that they don't keep the maid. This makes absolutely no sense to me. Why would you offer something only  make people wait for a healthier option? I walked out with three bowls. Hungry. No rain check offered. No offer of any sort to rectify the situation besides me waiting and I would still have to pay full price."}
{"text":"Listen, this place is very good. You can't beat the price, service, and quality. Especially when it's convenient and considered fast food. One of the best as far as that goes. They always have fresh selections, hot, and taste very good. Can't really ask for much more."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know why this location gets so many bad reviews. It's by far my favorite location because the food is cooked to perfection. I don't really care for when I go to other Panda locations and my orange chicken is coated in sauce and extremely soft. It makes the chicken seem undercooked in my opinion.  At this location they actually cook the chicken to a perfect crisp and I love it so much. The staff are also super sweet and friendly compared to other locations, it's the only location I prefer going to now."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru and the line was out into the parking lot and we get to the window and there is 5 people standing there talking to each other while there's still a huge line. Triniti gave us our food but was just rude. At least they have one on bell that is better"}
{"text":"The shrimp is amazing, I highly recommend both dishes. People on here are whining because they had to wait a little longer for fresh food...we did too and it was so worth it. They didn't have two things we wanted right away but they made both things fresh for us and replaced all our other food, upon request, so we didn't leave with cold food. The manager couldn't be nicer about it.  The only con was that the orange chicken was a little hard and slightly cold, which is why I took a star off...don't mess with my orange chicken. However, the shrimp made up for it."}
{"text":"I'v been coming here at least once a week for my lunch break since I've started working nearby. I've dined in each time I've been here, 3 times now, and it's always clean when I come in, and although it couldn't be anymore cleaner, the staff still would mop the floors. I see it done each time I am eating here on my break. Staff always greets people when the come in. And it does get busy, but I feel comfortable coming here on my break to eat and relax on their cushioned seats :)"}
{"text":"I am actually sitting stuck in the drive-through here at the Parma location writing this because there is no way out once you are in the line. I stopped here thinking I could save time (HUGE MISTAKE) by hitting a drive thru since all I wanted was a SMALL fried rice to accompany the dinner I was making. Needless to say I wait in the line only to be told that they don't offer small à la carte items and then if I would like a fried rice I have to pay $7.90 for a medium or even more for a large. Can we say bullshit? If you no longer carry a size perhaps you should put something over the menu that says it is not available. Or instead of being snotty perhaps offer to provide a small amount of rice in the medium container. Needless to say I will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"I come here often but today was just unbelievable. I got the angus steak and when I was eati my last mushrooms. I was cutting it I. Half and when I did. It wasn't even cook. It looked like they just threw it in wit hint 5 mins before it finished cooking. And my boyfriend complains the the cashiers I'm guessing he's an assistant manager because he was wearing the black uniform. He tells us that's how they cook the angus steak and the mushrooms room temperature. Like really? That's unsanitary! No food should be room temperature & he has the nerve to tell us that oh it also depends on how long you bought the food. Like the heck? We barely just ate it. If I could give this place no stars I would."}
{"text":"Alert: Possible Food Poisoning.  While the staff is friendly and the food is actually quite good. I've now had diarrhea twice from this place. While its possible it was the spices, not ruling out uncleanliness given the past reviewers."}
{"text":"We eat here often, but lately the drive-thru is understaffed and it takes a while to get thru."}
{"text":"Just a heads up to all military members, you have to specifically ask for a military discount even if in uniform. Apparently it's a \"new rule\" to deter the employees from just giving discounts to random people. Makes total sense...  Update: Now you have to show ID while in uniform after you ask for military discount. Cause apparently there are people who spend $200 on a uniform and get a fake CAC just to get a discount at this specific Panda Express. Sounds like some employees and managers need some training."}
{"text":"Its 11:00 and you guys cant accommodate chowmain because you guys are closing in 30 minutes im very upset there is no reason why you guys cant"}
{"text":"Awesome...I go here so much...I literally walk in and they already know what I want...true customer service"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten at a panda express. I have to say it's still the same with the addition of Brown rice and done delicious ribs."}
{"text":"Ordered online for it to be ready at 7 and when I showed up at 7:11 was told I had to wait another 5 minutes. Unprepared"}
{"text":"I have not been to a Panda Express in a long time. The menu has gotten creative and still under $10 I got the Spicy Tofu and Eggplant  and steam rice which is still under 400 calories. I mean it still definitely fast food however it wasn't too bad at all!   Best,  K.Kaviar"}
{"text":"I really like this is drive thru when I want chinese and just want to wear grubby clothes.   The food has always been fresh here unlike some of the other pandas.   On the down side prices keep going up and seems they give you less food."}
{"text":"When it's hot, it's hot. When it's not, you're better off walking away and going somewhere else. It's a  brutal way to buy food,  but sometimes the entrees at this place just seem tired.  Orange chicken is always good. Same with the teryaki. Most of the premium entrees are worth the extra buck, but pay close mind to look before you buy. Akso, for this location, takeout is better than dining in. The setup could be better. Looking at people's butts that close while they order and i eat just isn't my thing."}
{"text":"The only reason this location gets a star at all is because it is a Panda Express. The service and food is consistently terrible. We have been to this location now three times and every time they run out of food, the employees are slow, ineffective, and apathetic, and the floor is a sticky mess. I encourage the manager and owner to spend more time training their employees."}
{"text":"When it first opened, it was the best Panda I've had. The quality has gone down since. I got served old chicken, and my son's orange chicken had a bone in it..."}
{"text":"Be aware that even though on the panda express website you can set up a delivery order....THEY WILL NOT DELIVER. My order was 15 minutes late so I called to ask what was happening and the store told me that they didn't deliver and had never gotten my order. I contacted the main company for a refund, but it's just ridiculous the option would even be available online if the store doesn't actually do it."}
{"text":"This place isn't open till 2am. They close at 12. Worst place to go too if u craving asian food"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Panda Express. I was extremely happy with the staff and cleanliness of the establishment. The temperature of the fried rice and orange chicken was perfect, the chicken and mushrooms was just slightly cooler. I will definitely return for lunch"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep eating at Panda.  I think I had good Panda once and I keep going back to repeat the experience but it's never good.    As I was leaving, I went to refill my drink and one of the employees came to the drink station and opened the bottom cabinet door where I was standing and it smacked my legs.  I gave him this look like \"are you fucking kidding me\" and he just stood there with the door still opened and pressing against my legs.  So then I said \"are you fucking kidding me\" and he acted like he had no idea what was going on, and said \"what? oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.\"  What a cop out."}
{"text":"Last night was the last time I will ever stop at this panda. My family and I went in there to have dinner. It was 9:05 pm. There was 5 employees there, not one acknowledged us. One lady was cleaning the glass, the other cooking, and the rest appear to be having a conversation through their headsets. We stood there for 5 min waiting for someone to say something. Worst customer service, what's wrong with these people?"}
{"text":"We have tried this place 2 times now...  But not again...  First time food was cold. And even though this was a new restaurant it was filthy..  Spilt drinks, dirty tables, and trash bins full..   2nd visit more of the same...  Fried rice was clumpy and food was still cold... And it's not like they didn't have enough staff..  There were employees standing all around, chatting with each other...   We have been to Panda Express in other cities and they have been very good.  This is by far the worst..."}
{"text":"Usually when we go to Panda we have a good experience. We've been to this new one. Couple times now and this time we went it was awful. One car in drive thru on Sat. 25 March at 4:45 approx. we had four orders. The sweet fire chicken was cold and dry. It tasted as If it had been sitting for quite some time. The orange chicken was the worst I've ever had. The teriyaki chicken came with no sauce like it usually does and the bowl with rice and orange chicken there were about 6 pieces of orange chicken. What is going on??? We've never had such bad quality food from Panda. Straighten up or lose customers. Oh and I've attached pictures of the burnt crap cheese wantons that we also paid for. Why?  They got thrown away. Thanks for a terrible meal."}
{"text":"Tonight was chilly here in Vegas and I had a taste for Chinese, I was thinking war wonton soup, orange chicken, and fried rice.  As I was driving home from the Mountains Edge Area I noticed the \"Panda\" sign which  led me like starving puppy into the Albertsons shopping center.  The drive through was a little hidden, and once in line it was packed (I was the 9th or 10th car in the que, armed with my patience and the fact that it was Friday and I had no other plans but to go home and chill, I was fine!   Unfortunately, they did not have any soup offerings so... I opted to try the 8 treasure chicken which was flavourful and had a little kick, the orange chicken, which was also very flavourful, tangy, sweet, just the right amount of sauce and a nice crunch and the fried rice, which had a milder flavour to balance out the meal.  The young girl at drive-through window was very pleasant, well spoken and had a friendly, warm smile.  Tonight's  Panda experience was overall very pleasant!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a half star I would... NO STAR WOULD BE BETTER!  The husband and I went through the drive thru last night and order two combos. When we got home we hardly had ANY food. Very very small portions. Not to mention it didn't taste very good at all and my husband and my one yr old and myself DO NOT FEEL GOOD AT ALL THIS MORNING! Not sure if it was from the food but my twins didn't eat any Panda and they are fine....  We will not be going back....."}
{"text":"Although I love Panda, this location is a rip off for no reason at all. When ordering, I was told that the \"premium\" items, which included the honey walnut shrimp, was a dollar extra. Of course, I'm wondering if this shrimp is cooked any different than the other locations. They said no. So why the extra charge? \"Because it's Downtown Summerlin.\" The dumbest answer ever. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Avoid this Panda Express!  Got here at 8:40, they close at 10:00. I only wanted a chicken teriyaki bowl. They said they shut the grille down at 8:00 (maybe the kitchen employees like to be home by 9:00?)  It wasn't just the chicken teriyaki. A third of the entrees are not available. What kind of fast food restaurant shuts down the kitchen two hours before they close? It would be different if they charged half price, since you have to pick over whatever is left after the grill closes down, but the prices remain the same. Failure of management at all levels.   Can you imagine McDonalds not having Big Mac's at 8:30 because they close at 10:00? Pathetic...  Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Panda Express many times but this time today was probably the worst service I've received anywhere. First we were the only people waiting to be helped and it took about 5 minutes. I would understand if it was busy but the workers just kept slowing walk by us not saying anything, another employee had to tell them to help. Then they charged us an extra 1.25 because we got Beijing beef (which does not have an extra cost) and put that it was the angus steak which is extra. It was a challenge to get them to give us the money back. They ended up giving us the cost of the entire order back in cash when we paid card then re put in the order in and has us pay the amount again, but only gave us a dollar back when it should have at least been 1.25... I know it seems ridiculous to complain about 1.25 but it's not a fancy place or anything and could've been handled a million times better."}
{"text":"Panda's food is consistent from location to location, so you always know what to expect when you go here. This location is no different than any other: the servers are polite, the food is cooked fresh before your eyes, sometimes there's a wait, and it's fairly reasonably priced. If you're looking for American-style Chinese fast food, this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Almost like any other Panda Express I've visited-- the people who work here are nice and the food is good. I'm not sure if the prices are more but an overall great spot for fast food."}
{"text":"Food was great but disappointed I can't say the same about the service impatient employees, they probably should smile more often !"}
{"text":"I don't even know how to start this review...    I ordered panda express through a delivery service called postmates. This is what showed up on my doorstep.   Fried rice : So over cooked the rice was not able to be chewed because it was so hard.  The eggs in the fried rice were completely black.  Spring Rolls: still frozen inside.   I called panda express and the lady who answered the phone didn't speak English.   I should have known never to eat panda express in the first place, but this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I would like to review Panda in the way that I feel about thier food.   Panda............................................... While it is convienent......................... There are several dishes to choose from................................... The service is good.............................  The portions are adequite................................... But you are sooooo...............................BORING.   I have never really been a fan but the oldest kids loves that stuff. It was her turn to pick the lunch and I had to go with it. There is nothing wrong but nothing great either."}
{"text":"Clean  Quick Cheap  Do not expect medium to high end food. It is fast food Chinese version. The staff is good, the place is usually clean and the prices are not too bad. I guess you get what you pay for.   I had Bejing beef and it was a little chewy but tasted good. Angie had steemed veggies and seemed to enjoy them. The kids had orange chicken and liked it."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is the problem. I've been to many PE locations throughout the U.S. and this one is the worst. Every time I go (about 4x and 4x too many), the food is never ready and what they have out looks so old. The staff clearly don't want to be there and the manager is always \"on break\". It's so disappointing because I love PE. Anyone who says the food and service is good (even for fast food) clearly have never had PE before. All the other reviews of this location are pretty accurate."}
{"text":"Americanized-Chinese fast food buffet style.  Upon walking in, the two cashiers just kind of stared at my girlfriend and I for a couple seconds and then went back to their conversation. When they were done one of them came over to put our orders together. I went with the fried rice with orange chicken and the walnut shrimp because eating things that live on land with things that live in the sea strangely brings me great satisfaction. We grabbed a large drink to split and I was amazed at how big the cup was. It almost looked like one of those giant big gulps from 7-11! The food was exactly the same as all of the other times I had frequented a Panda Express, so I always know what to expect when I come to one of their locations."}
{"text":"I literally just watched an employee drop a pen into the fried rice, fish it out with her bare hand, and continue serving from that bowl. Gross."}
{"text":"Great selection of many different meats and veggies you can choose from. The food is mediocre. Chicken Teriyaki is a great option but ive had better. Portions are also big. Expect to pay around $10-$12 for 2 meats abd a veggie option. One thing that is good is the service at this location. Super friendly and they make sure you get everything you need when leaving. The place is clean and is a good spot to go to if your feeling a quick spot to fill your craving.   Ive had better but will return if I ever have a craving.."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and service by Jose, had to wait on veges so he gave us a free drink. When veges were done he delivered it to our table. Thanks we will be back !"}
{"text":"I've been to 3 or 4 different ones at least once or twice a week here in Phoenix, and 95% of the time I have to wait for Veggies to be cooked. Sometimes waiting 15 or 20 minutes. The homeless come in for free drinks also."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting the chow main was burnt and I went up to get it replace with more burnt chow main, they seen that I was upset and they didn't even apologize don't come here it's a waste of money"}
{"text":"I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Panda's. If it wasn't across the street from work, I wouldn't go here at all.  Two separate times I have been double billed on my debit card for my lunch. I'm not saying it was intentional, but either way it is annoying to have to dispute a charge with your bank.  Fair warning."}
{"text":"The orange chicken from Panda is the best you will ever have.  This place used to be in South Hills Village mall years back.  Very happy it has returned.  I would prefer Panda over just about any other sit down or takeout Chinese place.  The wait can sometimes be long, but that is because it is so good.  Always worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience at Panda Express but this location was on another level of excellence! The restaurant was very clean. I was served by John. He was extremely welcoming an very nice. While eating I watched him interact with other customers an he was great with each and everyone. I will be back to this location and thanks again John you were awesome."}
{"text":"It's your standard Panda Express. This one is at least busy most of the time so the entrees seem to always be fresh and haven't been sitting in the warming tray for hours. The staff always seems to be friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"What to do when you have a little time on your hands? Catch up on Yelp reviews! I thought the cashier who helped us was super sweet and professional. All the guys working there were professionals. We had to wait for one of our sides to  be cooked and they brought it to our table. It turned out nice and fresh so we didn't mind the wait. My husband and I like to split a three-item combo. If we feel like having leftovers then we will order separate combos. One feeds two people as the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but nothing too special, but you can't expect too much from a chain restaurant. The staff was super friendly though!!"}
{"text":"Their Angus Top Sirloin & Large Succulent Shrimp, that's what's new and advertised as of 05/09/18.  Their shrimp is definitely not large and succulent at all.  The sauce it's cooked in is very over whelming and salty.  The sauce was soaked into my rice and chow mein making the entire meal salty.  Is 3 shrimps minimum you get for that $1.25 extra charge?  I was better off getting the walnut shrimp. Oh well.   As far as the service, excellent. Although I waited for a fresh batch of the Angus Steak n Shrimp because the current pan only had 2 pieces of shrimp.  How do you advertise that and not have the product in the meal itself?  Anyway, good service just horrible product. So with that being said, Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the place was clean. It's the basic fast food chain Chinese food. Absolutely nothing special besides being new. The food is 20 times better down the road at king wa, matter of fact... wish I went there"}
{"text":"The fried rice and noddles are tasteless. The were also out of a lot of dishes. Why would you wait until you are out to start making more? Also they were completely out of Broccoli beef. Bad management. Not happy at all. I would rather go to another restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"Food was very good...flavorful, well-prepared, moist, and hot. Staff was enthusiastic but not well trained. I had to wait on my food at the counter. They didn't offer to bring it to me. The dining room was filthy...dirty tables, over-flowing trash containers, debris on floors and counters. Not sure if I want to return.   Second visit: MUCH BETTER.  Dining room was clean. The food I ordered that needed prepared was brought to the table. ...and the food was just as delicious...the staff just as enthusiastic."}
{"text":"This location is always clean and the staff are always very polite and attentive that's why I choose to come to this location over any others, and the food is always good for fast food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the overall service and quality for customers care. Decided to try the online ordering lastnight seeing how i have previously before when I'm on a late night food run from work but seeing how I have certain food allergens i asked specifically in the extra instructions box that I would like my side's to be boxed separately in a to go box as well as the three entree's to be placed in a white to go box as well and wrote it was due to certain allergies I had so they would know not to plate it together. Simple you would think right? Wrong I happened to arrive fifteen minutes before my order was to be picked up and watched the workers discuss my order and still box my plate up all in me box and just set aside on the counter to get cold and for fifteen minutes it sat there. So it's time for me to pick up my order and so I walk up to the register and i explain to the worker how sorry iam to make their jib a bit difficult but due to Allergies I would like my side's and entrees to be placed in just two separate boxes she then becomes irritated and upset telling me that's just unacceptable and argues with me for a minute as to why and that never n her shift will and has that been allowed. Seeing how I've advised her I ordered it that way online she continues to be upset and finally agrees to just box it separately and then test to re-charge me for a side I paid for so as I begin to explain to her I've paid in full for my order online she asks me back to the register and then here's where the part i finally lost it happens. She shows me the receipt and says\" I'm looking at same thing, same receipt as you aim right so show me where anywhere on this on your receipt where it shows you pay that it shows you asked it to be boxed separately so next time before you come in here upset we no plate it the way you keep ask\" I became upset and told the cashier as I've ordered it many tunes thus way and know it does not print on my pay receipt does it include what else extra like soy sauce or chili packets on it and that is where I advised in the extra instructions section how I would like my order placed and then a\" management\" worker advised the worker that I was right it does not print or show on my copy if the receipt so to quit telling me something. Now I wish I could stop my review there but I won't because as I turn around to grab my stuff and leave the employees continue to bad mouth me and complain how arrogant and dumb I was and hassle of a customer I was in Spanish thinking based on the color of my skin I wouldn't understand but as aim Mexican and was still in full work uniform became offened and simply acknowledged them by politely saying I wish they had a good night and thanked them all for their help and service back to them in Spanish as they wanted to smile and say goodbye in English to me. I would say the staff was very unprofessional and rude and had already closed pretty much and food was stale and cold just the worst service !"}
{"text":"standard issue panda experience. good lunch for the money."}
{"text":"Let's start with the brand of Panda Express! It's not carried out at this location. The Panda express experience is not here. The staff is the issue in this location unfortunately. I'll be surprised if this location survives. The disconnect between the brand and the execution from top down is very disappointing an unfortunate. I am a big fan of the Panda Express brand. This store very much let me down. The energy and Passion of the Panda Express brand is not on display by the staff. The staff does not have any warm energy that is expected from the brand. This energy permeates into the food as well. If there's no energy motivating the employees it's not going to transfer to the food or service either. The food is never consistent. You will get different tastes of the same menu selection. Also, the meat a lot of times looks like it's been sitting there for hours. The vegetables are the same. Today when I ate here the carrots had two different distinct tastes as well as the other veggies. I think they were mixed with the old veggies. When I arrived there was almost no meat in any of the Bulls to serve to guests.   At a normal Panda Express the meats and vegetables will always be plentiful. You will usually see maybe one or two items missing. And,  if there  is any item missing  the front end  employees  will be yelling out  orders to the Cook  excitedly  for these items to be replaced  as soon as possible .   Pretty much all of the meats were missing at this location. And all of the meats that were left were very old looking. This type of service will not survive in this area. There are way too many better options to eat at. This could be a good store but it is not. This is very disappointing.   I've come here a couple of times. I would want to come here a lot more if the actual Panda Express brand would show up! The rating for this location is low for a reason. And, I've given it a 1 star to bring to the attention that this store needs before it fails."}
{"text":"So it's Panda Express, about the same as any other Panda, which is good and all, but a couple things to know about this location, in Town Square. It's right next to the movie theater, and the only budget friendly food in the entire mall, so it's always very very busy. Everything else is fine dining, sit down, so this fast food place, is not fast, but that's not really their fault, just something to be prepared for. They have the fast food monopoly there. Other then that, expect what you normally would from Panda."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. When they were charging me out for my food, the cashier said have a good day then walked away to help the next customer. They didnt give me a receipt. They have this sign on the cash register that your meal is on them if they don't give you a receipt. So I had to ask her for my receipt and asked her if that applied. She stated no, that I walked away. That she had my receipt there for me. I came in with the intention of paying for my meal, and for her to be rude with me saying that I walked away when she's the one that left me standing there making it seem like I just wanted something free is beyond me. If they aren't going to honor that plaque they need to remove it."}
{"text":"My wife's experience at this PE location reflects similar 1-star rating reviews.. Spare the grief and keep cruising up north a few miles to Pei Wei.. You'll thank me for It!!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Panda Express I have been to. Terrible customer service. If you're looking for fast food..FAST, avoid this place. I've been to this establishment maybe twice, both times I ordered, on drive-thru, 2 eentre plates, they always take well over 20 minutes and my food is given to me cold. Needless to say I will not be stopping by here again."}
{"text":"The food taste like it had been sitting out under the heat lamb or hot water! Rice crispy too spicy including the chowmiem!! Never had such a horrible food experience at Panda!!"}
{"text":"Come here all the time. Make sure you ask to taste before you buy. Sometimes it can be a bit dry bc food has been sitting there for some time."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Panda Express. I just don't like processed food. You can have fast food that's fresh, think Chipotle. Panda Express beats out a hamburger joint on a health scale, but it's not much better."}
{"text":"They almost always mess up your order when you're in the drive-thru no matter what time of the day it is and unfortunately when you find out it's when you're home. Total waste of money. If you want to receive the correct order then you might have to just go inside."}
{"text":"I happen to love Panda Express!  I put a little sweet and sour sauce on my fried rice and I enjoy every bite!  Tonight I decided to get the teriyaki chicken and orange chicken.  They were very generous with their portions and I had enough to share with my sister and have another meal.  I don't know how they do it but their food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Solid fast food choice+, hit or miss service, dirty tables, not enough high chairs."}
{"text":"The first time I went was in May when they had their grand opening in Monroeville. I was really excited because I don't know of any others even within a couple hours of Pittsburgh! The food was fresh and all of the entrees and sides are readily available. I really appreciated the complementary bowl when you used the coupon code for the grand opening. The thing I love the most about Panda Express is the deliciousness and authenticity of the food itself WITHOUT restaurant prices. Additionally, by no means, is this like the crappy mall court Chinese spots ( in which I refuse to eat). The location is decent; it gets a little crowded where the line stretches out the door, but that's the least of my worries. Lastly, they carry Pepsi products; I love coke products but whatever. I love it! Keep up the good work!!!'"}
{"text":"I went here last night around 730pm and went through the drive thru. It wasn't as busy only 2 cars ahead of me. I ordered my typical order which was half half (noodles and rice), also teriyaki chicken and orange chicken. Bought my husband noodles, beef broccoli, mushroom chicken, and Shanghai Angus steak.  They gave me a 10% discount because they had a four minute wait on the steak.  The service was nice but I did feel bad for the people behind me because I thought they might have me move and wait but they didn't.  I went home and enjoyed my late night meal with my hubby it was fresh and good. We like Panda Express for a quick Chinese meal. One thing though I wasn't told the Shanghai Angus steak was $1.25 more until I looked at my receipt. But other than that, the price is fairly reasonable for fast Chinese food:)."}
{"text":"Typical panda. All the food looks so amazing and then you get it home and its just Eh. Could do worse with a quick meal, but I always leave feeling so dissatisfied with the food. Service was quick and friendly, so no complaints at all with staff. But unfortunately service is only part of the picture, and pushing $10 for lunch I have higher expectations."}
{"text":"My review is more for corporate .... The food sucks now !  who told y'all to take the egg out the fried rice and replace it with corn? That isn't flipping fried rice. YUCK . Won't waste my money at Panda Express anymore unless I'm buying boba . The staff members were fantastic, great customer service! Go girls."}
{"text":"This Panda Express hasn't disappointed yet. It always serves up hot, fresh, and tasty food which is great because sometimes you get tired of the regular selection of fast food. Just don't go to the Panda Express on Craig and Jones, I've been there twice and both times it was absolutely awful."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times were horrible. My husband went there once because his GPS said it was closer to the house than the one off of Craig and Scott Robinson (which is head over heels better). He said he could barely eat it but he did because he was hungry.   Don't go! You'll save money and your taste buds from a bad meal."}
{"text":"Panda is Panda, but when you have a busy but clean store and a rock star kayla working the counter, all is good!  The food was fresh and hot and hit the spot and on the cheap here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Waited for 12 freaking Minutes in drive thru from the time i ordered for the kids meal version of the terriyaki chicken. If it wasnt for my child who is limited to certain foods because of allergies, i wouldve just drove away without getting anything even though i paid. Not that anyone from this business will see this anyway. One star because i cant choose zero"}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied with food quality. We went thru drive thru. I had ordered the Beef Broccoli with Chow Mein. There was no beef!!! Just broccoli with a funky taste loaded over old Chow Mein that was tasteless and dry. My husbands meal was no better. My son picked at his meal but it did not look appetizing at all.  This was our first visit to this new location- very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for the office it said it would be ready in 30 minutes and it's been 45 apparently their online system doesn't work very well but the customers in line are getting served. Maybe I should have just stood in line"}
{"text":"Great customer service, smiling, helpful, attentive employees. Food was great, just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"WORST UBER EATS EXPERIENCE EVER.   Got a confirmation that our order was being prepared, after almost 10 minutes of waiting for it to be delivered (and was said on the app was on the way) a staff member called and said they don't have 2 of the 3 items we wanted. Those were orange chicken and grilled chicken teriyaki which I believe is up there on the most popular entrees. We got confused on why they'd be out of their most ordered items so we asked if they're closing (**just  checked placed the order good 30 minutes before actual closing). The staff member - who was being coached by the \"manager\" ELLEN, said that they are closing so the chef doesn't want to cook anymore and they have to prep for tomorrow. That was totally understandable but I wish they turned off their delivery option if so. We asked if the chowmein was fresh and he said yes he just cooked it a minute ago. That was a big lie since if they were already prepping to close, why would they even bother cooking a fresh batch of chowmein? Unless all their chowmein are cooked the day before.... Bummer oh well but that's okay we'll just cancel it. OH WAIT WE CANT CANCEL IT WE HAVE TO TAKE IT TO UBER EATS.   So you're telling me that you process my payment first before looking at what we ordered and then when you decide that you don't feel like cooking you tell me you can't do anything about my processed money since its under uber eats?????  I worked 5 years at a restaurant too. We had grubhub, amazon eats and ubereats. We get tired at times too and decided to close a bit early on some days. BUT WE ALWAYS CATER TO CUSTOMER'S NEEDS FIRST. We see first what they want, if we have it, how fast we can cook and deliver it. Not the other way around.   For such a huge corporation, this kind of service is so disappointing. Obvious lack of staff training. Specially the guy staff member being coached by the pretend manager Ellen.   Try being HANGRY and literally paying for it. Ruined night.  Thanks Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Walk in and not a single person in store. Lady who maybe owns or runs this place has her head in her hands maybe sleeping idk. She sees me and ignores me to help some teenagers which is fine but I ordered online almost 30 minutes ago. She finally makes all their food and I have to ask her to help me. I said I ordered and paid online she looks around confused and walks to printer. She had zero idea. Didn't acknowledge or care. I'm still waiting  and she's standing there ignoring me. Panda is panda. Same at every one which is fine.  But how could you be so horrible to someone purposely. Will never come  back.  Wish I hadn't paid in advance."}
{"text":"by far the worst panda I've ever been to. it's close to the house and typically I've had great experiences w/ Pandas but every time I go here I'm left unhappy. they literally gave me four pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"The crowd was huge, and we all wanted orange chicken. Not only did the team keep orders moving smoothly, they stayed on top of replacing empty food items as fast as possible. They worked like a well-oiled machine to get everyone through the line quickly with quality service."}
{"text":"It took them a whole 10 minutes to come to the window after ordering, we were greeted by a snarky girl who didn't even look at us, and our food was ICE cold."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of Panda Express from high school - delicious, warm, crispy orange chicken that brightened my day and encouraged me to go back to the sad window-less walls of my existence.   So on our impromptu quest the other day to find a nearby Panda Express after years (and I mean yeeeears), I was really looking forward to having orange chicken again and relive my memories! Unfortunately, my expectations were to be dashed.  Although there were a dizzying number of options, it was a bit of a challenge to find the most appetizing because well, everything looked so cold and dry. I eventually decided on the orange chicken and beef with broccoli and hoped against hope that I'd be proven wrong.  I wasn't, it tasted as bad as it looked, and it was a challenge convincing myself to finish the meal despite the fact that we'd taken a half an hour trip out of the day just to go find the closest Panda Express.   The service was great and the employees were all really nice. The food just wasn't worth the drive out, especially for a Friday night."}
{"text":"I was at work and I got hungry so I went online to look for a place to get food. I saw a Panda Express near by so I went over and got a plate of chow mein and vegetables at first when I got the food everything looked fine. After I got back to work I opened the plate it was fine at first but then I looked closer and saw that the cabbage had some mold on it. This is a very important thing to know because mold can get a person very sick and harm there health. I will NOT be returning to a Panda Express!!!t"}
{"text":"Love this place. So cheap and tasty. Doesnt get much better with fast food Chinese. They have a drive thru too! Thier chow mein is pretty amazing if you like chow mein."}
{"text":"Customer service should be a priority no matter what type of restaurant it is. I visited this location and it was 20 minutes till closing time, if the clock has not struck closing time then a customer should have the full service that they are paying for. As soon as my partner and I walked through the doors to enter the cashier seemed annoyed, the staff was more than ready to close their door. Only scraps were left and she immediately stated that what they had left was the only thing that we could order. The noodles were broken and not even a spoonful was left, and the sauces were thick and reduced to sticky clumps. I was so hungry I chose from their mediocre selection and whatever didn't look like it had chewed up and spit out onto the platter. I felt frustrated and then insulted when my partner asked the cashier for soy sauce packages and the cashier gave a rude sigh and rolled her eyes.   No matter what type of restaurant it is, a customer pays for the food and should receive great service. A good restaurant should require nothing less than excellent customer service from their employees. I feel sorry to say this location is far from having such service."}
{"text":"Panda Express is one of my favorite fast food option if you are looking for asian cuisine in a hurry. The employees at this particular location are friendly, quick, and attentive to my quirky style of ordering. I always get the two plate entree with a mix of rice and chow mien finished off with their delicious orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. if you are looking for a quick bite and not really feeling the mikey D's route I would recommend panda express. its amazing."}
{"text":"Love the variety.  Wish there was more peanut flavor to the dishes that call for it.  Lacking a little lustre in the sesame department as well.  Defiantly not authentic Chinese.    But decent fast food.  Prices were higher than I expected."}
{"text":"I would like to put ZERO stars but I couldn't.. the staff here needs to learn how to cook.. I bought chicken mushrooms and it was ridiculously cooked .. take a look at the picture.. I can cook better then that.ill never return."}
{"text":"Horrible. The quality doesn't compare with other Panda Express places. The cheese wontons were hard and stale. The chowmain didn't have any vegetables and the noodles were hard and cold. I almost tossed it. The furniture  is dirty and cheap and ugly.  I was here 4 years ago and the quality was really bad but I decided to try again since it had been such a long time. Never again."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant today and the cashier was doing both jobs. But she (Heather) was not washing her hands before serving the food  or not wearing gloves. I just think it is very unsanitary and it makes me wonder what else are these young kids are doing."}
{"text":"We are officially done with this restaurant and apparently this whole chain. I had hoped it was just the one at the casino, or just the new one on Camelback, but no, they have all declined. Portions are small, selections are few, and now you seldom see more than one or two fresh items. Old dried-out lunchtime food was still there at 4:30 445. I was told they had been very busy. The place was deserted. They were spooning items up from the bottom from one thing to another but it didn't seem fresh. The rice was a small amount it looks very dry the chow mein likewise. The containers are new, smaller, looks like all the prices are up. All the new selections have lots of those hot red peppers. And just the old boring two or three items that do not have the red peppers. Time to seek a new Chinese carry out."}
{"text":"Portions are horrible and the staff does not care. Stay away go to a mom and pops place"}
{"text":"I've been going here for the past 5 years and don't really have anything bad to say about this restaurant.  This Panda Express has been remodeled and it looks nice.  The food is good too.  I always get the broccoli and chicken.  Super quick meal."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, and always fresh ( at least when I go) I always try to go after 1pm as it has slowed down from the lunch rush. The food is still fresh and the staff are always friendly. I have even gotten the kids meal with a large ice tea and believe it or not, that fills me up as well plus its a little cheaper.   All in all, its Panda Express. I mean what more can you ask for? Quick, cheap, done."}
{"text":"I used to think this panda was below semi-decent. However one day I decided to go for another round of bad food. This time this location of Panda Express really sold it to me that I should never go back here again. In fact, I never returned since that day. As I walked in my nostrils were bombarded by the horrific and overwhelming scent of rotten fish. It was obvious to me that I did not want to eat their food, so instead I went to a Mexican cuisine joint."}
{"text":"So an hour before closing according to google, I arrive to a locked pair of doors. Employees watching me struggle and shamefully walk away. No customers inside.  I had to use the restroom bad and wanted some damn panda . I go to Taco Bell instead  because they didn't bother to unlock the door for a paying regular . Come back to see someone ordering inside. Real nice."}
{"text":"This panda is subpar. It has the ability to be amazing but the skimpy amounts of food they give 90%of the time makes them cheap on food but high on cost.   People are always standing out the door and waiting for food. This staff is never prepared for the dinner rush. And by Rush I mean four people in line. They are always waiting for the veggies and orange chicken.  Tonight on our visit there was a very dangerous sauce spill on the floor in the middle of the walkway. Instead of cleaning it to prevent a fall the workers walked around this for nearly the whole time we were eating. Then one employee went on dinner break right in the middle of the big rush.  This restaurant is always freezing cold and dirty. Only reason why we eat here is it is close to our house. There are much better pandas to eat at."}
{"text":"A four compared amongst the other locations that I would give a 3. The one on Marks St. Is gross. Everything was fresh and selections were full . Chow mein was not greasy like other locations & Zahira was ver nice & customer service oriented"}
{"text":"Nice quickie Chinese , u can sample food n decide what u want . Like their chilli beef and Hakka noodle combo . Awesome"}
{"text":"Panda Express is in a food court in the middle of the Vegas strip. While it is an okay place, I'm just not that fond of food courts. The folks who waited on my were young and not overly friendly. That said, I have to give some leeway because I was there in the midst of the lunch crowd, and they had to be overwhelmed with customers. My biggest complaint was that my soda was flat, and my food was only lukewarm. It would have been nice to have a nice fizzy soda and hot food. I ordered a sweet and sour chicken, and I just wasn't impressed with the food quality or temperature. I'll give them another chance, but I'm in no rush to do so."}
{"text":"Almost a 30 minute wait for food and then they completely forgot about me and sold one of the items I ordered! Manager did nothing to accommodate me afterwards. This place is NEVER ready for the dinner rush! Never coming back to this location!!!"}
{"text":"General feel:  This location is great.  It is relatively new and offers a fast drive-thru and sparkling new interior.  Same affordable and quality tasting meals that makes me love the Panda Express brand.  Customer service:  Two employees I've noticed, Susana - she is extremely welcoming and genuine, it is always nice to see her,  and Nancy - I appreciate her efficiency at taking orders and serving guests, on busy days she keeps the line moving fast.   There is one girl I will remain nameless, let's call her Lipstick, is a bit .... how to put it ... it seems as every day is her first day on the job.  Which is a bit frustrating when you see her every time.  Tip:  Fill out the easy survey (online or by phone) on the back of your receipt and receive a free entree with your next purchase of a two-entree plate.  I love giving positive feedback!  It's easy for people to criticize, I like to recognize whats good :)"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for chains like this, but saw that the store's management had commented on some other posts, so I figured I'd share my experience: I've been coming to this Panda location for years, and it's always been great! There's an older woman who has helped me multiple times, and she's always worked really hard to make sure my family is taken care of (we usually come in with big orders!).   Most recently, I submitted an online order that was still being worked on when I arrived at the store to pick it up. The staff (the older woman I always see) gave us a couple of cups to grab drinks while we waited, and even though one of our orders was assembled incorrectly, they were very polite and apologetic when we returned to the counter to get the correct side. They never turn us down when we ask for extra fortune cookies, either!   Food always seems fresh, and if you do need to wait a few minutes for a fresh batch to be made, it's worth it to get that fresh scoop of food!"}
{"text":"Last Sunday was the 1st time I've ever been to a Panda Express. The food was awesome and the service was amazing. Way to go everyone that works there :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food was cold! That's not even half of it. I asked for sweet and sour sauce on the side for spring rolls and the guy had an attitude at the window when I asked again saying it was in the bag. Not to mention I asked for a sample that I never got. When I got home there was a hair in the food!!!! I have purple hair so a short curly black hair is NOT mine! The sweet and sour sauce was not in the bag but hot sauce only. I had 6 spring rolls how do you not put sweet and sour sauce with it!?"}
{"text":"Like another review. I also got food poisoning here. I've tried it 3 times and the 3rd was the worst. Charge me for extra sides, added an extra charge for honey walnut shrimp when it was shrimp and orange chicken. A bunch of kids literally leaning against the walls talking and flirting. Hands me half my order then shuts the window. Comes back a few minutes  later and I tell him I need the rest. I get told it's 7-10 minutes. So I tell him I want everything fresh and at the same time. I get an \"ok\" takes my food I marked the box so I can check. Sure enough he gave me the same food back when the food is ready so I get half hot half cold food. This is crap. I want a refund. I wasted 40 minutes and $30 of my time here for the last time."}
{"text":"Called in a order for broccoli only with my entree, and was told I could only have mixed vegetables. I've been eating and ordering my meal with broccoli only for several years at several locations across NV and CA and never been told it wasn't an option. When I arrived to pick up my order tables were dirty, trash was overflowing and a staff member was chatting at a table with someone. They were not busy."}
{"text":"Just your average Panda Express fast food joint. It's clean and air conditioned inside, and the service is quick. My favorite is the honey walnut shrimp! It's delicious."}
{"text":"The line for ordering food here wasn't that long but somehow it took over 15 minutes just to place my order then they didn't even have the food I wanted prepared. They barely gave me any orange chicken and the employees were constantly distracted and didn't talk to me. It took forever to get someone at the cashier to ring me out even though no one was in front of me and my food was ready to go. I can easily say that I will not be coming here again. Panda Express, no express included"}
{"text":"We were welcomed by all the staff . The food was good , we only had to wait a few minutes for the fresh food to come out . It was kind of slow service but that could have been because the people in front of us ."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm feeling good old American Chinese I try to swing by here since it's close to where I work. Aaaaand everytime I come in at lunch they're out of half of their food items. You wouldn't believe how many people come in, see half empty trays and just walk back out again. It's like this location doesn't want to make any money. I don't think I've ever been here and not had to wait for something to be cooked or just left so I don't waste time."}
{"text":"this location is always friendly and greets you when you walk in the door. the restaurant was very clean. the tables were all clean and the restroom was clean and smelled nice."}
{"text":"I do not care for their new fried rice that's the only reason I haven't been eating their lately. Replacing eggs with corn seriously?? Not a happy camper with panda anymore."}
{"text":"You have to know what is fresh, I go in and ask to taste, had honey walnut shrimp it was awesome, spring rolls good, egg rolls not so much.  Rice is tasteless but not greasy.  Will go back for shrimp!"}
{"text":"Been here a total of three times and every time service has always been rude, slow, and inaccurate. Last time I go to this location."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is located inside a Von's grocery store. If you walk through the produce department you will see it. I love that it is conveniently inside the store because I stop there several times a week and when I feel like quick Chinese it is right there on the way to the check out!  I like that they always offer me a sample. I was sure of what I wanted one time until I tried a sample of the \"Fire Cracker Chicken\" and was hooked! If you haven't tried the \"Chicken Pot-Stickers\" you NEED to because they are simply delicious!!!  There is some seating right near where you pay so if you are on a lunch break or something you can sit down and enjoy it there."}
{"text":"The service at this place is pure poop. The drive through is a death march. The inside service is terrible. All they have to do is scoop food on a plate, this seems to be too much of a challange for the staff. Coach your people! I like Panda from time to time, but this location is a real let down. The quality of food is consistant with others."}
{"text":"Just waited 33 minutes for my food. I asked the guy why was it so long to get my food, he said a lot of people are inside and they had to continually make food. It's 7pm. You literally have to not be doing anything to wait for 33 minutes in line. I drove around to look how many people were inside and there were about 8 people. Only 3 people actually in line. 5 eating. Such a bad representation. I pray they get audited as the manager there should not have a job. I literally could have sat down at PF changs and been out of there quicker. It's truly an embarrassment to Panda bc all other locations have been great. Yea sometimes you wait for food. But not 33 minutes.   Alex, I appreciate the apology, but it's should be the companies expectations; not mine, to get your food out quicker. I promise you, I could have sat down at a packed restaurant and had my food by then. Literally if you aim to please, this should never happen."}
{"text":"I go here so often because of the convenience and the fact that it is in the same plaza as the neighborhood Walmart store lol. Nothing too special about this place, but the food is a hit or miss at times.   I usually get their honey sesame chicken and orange chicken. There have been times where both actually had a crunchy exterior which made the meal pretty good. The Beijing beef is okay, but kind of on the dry side and it sucks when it is soggy.   The staff members are nice and I've noticed that you get bigger portions of the meats if you go near closing time since they are trying to get rid of the food. Good to know if you have the late night munchies!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Panda Express locations and I was very impressed with this one. It was clean and the food was fresh even at an off time of 2pm. It's cool they have a drive thru which I may use the next time I am in this side of town."}
{"text":"While in line the power went out. While that was understandable the behavior of the staff was not. Rather than face the customers to explain they didn't know exactly what to do they retreated to the rear of the restaurant and laughed amongst themselves. When they did finally come over to talk to the eight or so people in line it just got more confusing. First the clerk said we can serve you but we can't take your money right now. When I gave my order she said \"we can't serve you.\" So which is it? Maybe when things run smoothly they're ok but in an ever so slight crisis mode they're useless."}
{"text":"Horrible establishment! Went through drive thru. Got my order wrong twice! When I received my food the lady at the window was coughing on it while handing it to me. I called the manager to report the situation and he said\"she just has a little cold\"! We will never be back!"}
{"text":"Only giving two stars because it's Chinese, and I LOVE chinese. That being said, I've never had an excellent experience. Today was the worst. I only got egg rolls and cream cheese rangoons.   My egg rolls were burnt, the staff seemed annoyed that I was interrupting their conversation (I'm pretty sure the one girl may have even rolled her eyes at me and she practically tossed my bag of food out the window) and my food didn't come with anything. No sauce of any sort. No napkins. Nothing. To my understanding, they are supposed to, as I have received them in prior visits without asking.   I'm not here to complain about the quality of food (let's be honest...it's not gourmet), but rather the staff. They were very young kids working the window, but they need some serious training in how to treat customers."}
{"text":"The worst Panda Express I have ever been to. They do not seem to have their act together with food being made, lots of customers standing around waiting for their food...Only one chef in the back area making the food while another lady shouting food orders to him and another chef doing absolutely nothing. My order was made up and getting cold while my wife waited for more simple fresh veggies to be made (why does that take so long?) We eventually just left after standing their for about 15 minutes!!! Will not be back....The Signal Butte location is much better"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome, very clean restaurant (especially considering the location), but the prices are little out of control."}
{"text":"As a parent I just can't find much nutrition in this menu plus I've never had a meal here I like.  With that being said.  My sons love this place.  Thick sweet syrup on most of the entrees and meals is probably why. When they beg to here I eat elsewhere and let them indulge"}
{"text":"This Panda has to have the slowest drive thru service in Arizona. They always seem to run out of food,  especially during lunch and dinner rush times. No planning."}
{"text":"I always come at this place at around 4-6 pm and the workers are really polite and friendly! But once i came in at like 8:50 something like that, the old lady (i never usually see her there, probs night shift) who was working basically kicked me out of the store lol. She said they're closed, but the doors were open(??) Im pretty sure they dont close until 9 or even maybe 10."}
{"text":"My fiance placed an order that was supposed to be picked up at 8 pm on Sunday evening.  She arrived in store at 8:10 p.m.  To her surprise, not only were they out of most of what we ordered, but they hadn't even STARTED our order yet.  The employees on duty ignored my fiancee and were very unpleasant with her.  What is the point of being able to order online when you have to go in and place your order AGAIN!? This is what happens when you hire young people and don't give them direction! Nothing, and I MEAN NOTHING was being prepared. Never have I known Panda to run out of anything, but tonight they were out of everything and they evidently not preparing anymore! Well thanks to the level of service this evening, you have made my decision very easy! I will now be ordering from Pei Wei, because unlike you, they make their food fresh to order so they do not run out! I'd love to thank you for a wonderful dinner, however all I can thank you for this evening is for a s####y experience! You have lost business this evening and Pei Wei has gained faithful customers! As of 2/26/18, no one has responded to this to try to rectify this situation! Classy company right there! HAHA. I am interested but do not know how to direct message you (this is for the below comment by Derek T."}
{"text":"Ugh. How is this place so widely popular. The fried rice is dry and tasteless. The broccoli beef is fatty with slight chemical taste and on my last visit the sodas lacked the proper carbonation. Further the food was not cheap. I gave it an extra star for good chicken spring roll. The bar is pretty low though for stars. Yuck is what I say."}
{"text":"Wow I'm so disgusted! I just came here today 40 mins before closing and was waiting to order. The cashier asked angel to help but she was already cleaning and mopping and so angel quickly came over and asked me what I would like to order and I basically told her nevermind. I change my mind because you didn't wash your hands after you got done cleaning. So gross!!!!!!  This place is so disgusting I will never come to this location ever again!!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh & tasty. A good value for the money. However, our last order of chop suey had huge pieces of onions which take up more space so you get less noodles and other veggies and way more onions. I hope this was a fluke and not a cost cutting measure."}
{"text":"Alex M.     I see you replied to my comment on behalf of Panda Express.  I have one more suggestion.  It is always best to read a comment before responding.  That just makes sense.  Clearly you did not."}
{"text":"I ordered online and set a pick up time, they did not have it ready but they did give me a drink while I waited for them to finish. That's customer service. They know they messed up but made it right! However, I watched the line and the person I would have been behind already got their food, so I don't recommend using the online services & won't be using it again."}
{"text":"The Staff was nice. Sabrina even held the door open for me as I walked out with my Togo order! I'll be back thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely abysmal location. A few weeks ago, I had gone through the drive-thru at this location to get some dinner. After I had ordered and given them my payment, the girl at the window told me that my card had declined. I was in shock beings that I knew my account was fine, so it had to be on their end. I asked them if they could possibly try manually entering the card information, to which she agreed and asked for photo ID. Unfortunately, all I had at the moment was my passport, so I gave her that.  But not only did she start laughing when I gave her the passport, she also said my card was still declined and proceeded to snicker more as I felt embarrassed with a line behind me. I ended up having to drive to the gas station to get cash back. I did end up going back there too, this time instead of giving her all dollars, I gave her 40 cents in pennies to count. Hopefully that taught her not to be rude."}
{"text":"I was contacted by someone from panda after we got sick from under heated food suggesting I contact guest relations.  It would seem to me that upon learning this.. he would contact the necessary parties and make sure the cooks are doing what they are supposed to..to be sure no one else gets sick...it's not my job to correct the restaurant problems.  There was no assurance this is being done.  We are not interested in a free meal from a place that made us sick. And it's not the 1st time from this location where food is not hot or where freshly cooked food is dumped in w older food.  We took the time to write...most wont.. so it's lost business.  Getting people sick is not good for any eatery.  It's obvious they think a free meal is a remedy. ..it is NOT.  Your restaurant made us sick..ruined our night...it's not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Rude service at the drive thru and called to complain. Ungrateful teenager's. Go pick up dog poop and then complain work is hard!"}
{"text":"I also have had so many bad times coming to this Panda Express the food was alway not So fresh and good, but Despite all the bad reviews and bad experiences I gave this location another chance. The employees that worked day shift on Fathers Day especially the lady who took my order I think her name was Adolin, but she was very nice and gave us good service when I called to make an order for pick up on Father's Day and showed customer appreciation and gave good portions not like all the times I normally go they give such tiny scoops. Anyways when my fiancé went to pick it up they were very nice and even left a sweet happy Father's Day message on box thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"Yeah this panda is bad .  To start off it looks closed there is limited lighting inside and over an hour after opening half of there sides aren't ready . I had to wait for my sides and it took forever . Some of the drinks weren't working and to there luck it was all the ones I like . I didn't rate it a one star because the food is fresh-ish but I'm defiantly not coming back here . And to top it off no manager was available to get a refund ."}
{"text":"I'm dropping the stars from 3 to 2.  My daughter ate here again while I tried out the new Sushi place where Julie's Chicken and Waffles sadly went out (already!).  I tasted her Orange Chicken, which I get nearly every time I go to the Panda Express near my home, and it just wasn't good.  She said she just wasn't going to eat there again since she wasn't happy with the last meal either. It either sat too long or cooked too long.  The Orange Chicken was dry and chewy and just not fresh and crisp like I know it should be.  Shame on you Panda Express!  For ruining something that your chain usually makes so well!  I'm not making it one star because the rice and Crab Won Tons were still decent."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Panda Express tonight but quickly changed our mind when we watched the cook cleaning the stove vent while they were still cooking food. My husband asked the girl at the cook line about what we were witnessing and she assured that it was fine and they did it all of the time. Now I can not say that I physically watched anything fall into the food that was being cooked but I didn't feel like finding out the hard way. Very unimpressed and won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"I was in a bind last night before the 7pm movie and wanted to eat something substantial for dinner instead of popcorn or candy at the theater... So, I surveyed the food court and decided on Panda Express.  I chose the eggplant & tofu in garlic sauce and mixed veggies for my 2 entree plate along with some steamed white rice.  I was expecting it to be greasy, but honestly, it wasn't that bad!  I might even go so far as to say I enjoyed it!  Marc N was my dining companion and it looked like he enjoyed his also... he did steamed white rice with mixed veggies and one of the chicken options I believe.  I would never go out of my way to eat at a Panda Express but when you're stuck in the food court at the mall (or at the airport), it comes in handy!"}
{"text":"I watched the person who must be a manager or owner sneeze and cough without covering her mouth in front of the food. Yuck! Several times before this one they are not ready and only a couple items are cooked. It is a clean restaurant but after seeing the total lack of sanitary practices, I might advise you choose another location."}
{"text":"c'mon bro. you know i had to eat here. but they had the skimpiest menu ever. had maybe like 4 items. wtf. service was good as usual for panda. and this place was large but their items weak. where is my chicken and potato or chicken and string beans??"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that on two occasions had to wait and wait for our food.    They don't manage their supply of dishes well.   They make sure you've paid then shove you out of their way and go on to the next sucker! No other panda location I've been to has had this problem."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, clean and cheap and delicious-just as fast food should be when you have to eat on the go.  Everything looked great, and my entree was sauced well, I don't know what anyone could complain about for the price and atmosphere of drive thru Chinese."}
{"text":"I visited this Panda Express location this afternoon for lunch with a friend. Everything seemed as normal, the workers were nice enough. That's when I noticed there was a dead fly in my fried rice. Disgusting. Made me want to vomit. I think I can never eat at Panda Express ever again after this."}
{"text":"I love this location the crew there is right on !!! and the place is clean they have a vegetarian entrée and it keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Apparently, saying you'll be open at 11:30 on New Year's Day doesn't actually mean that you'll be open at 11:30 on New Year's Day. What the hell."}
{"text":"Panda Express hosted a party for my boys' karate school tonight so the place was packed. All the kids ate for free & they orchestrated games (like pin the tale on the donkey) and gave away prizes which was really cool of them to do. I find that the food at PE is consistent across the board no matter which location you go to."}
{"text":"The Panda Express ordering process is quick and painless. You choose a side (rice, fried rice, or chow mein) and then however many entrees you want down the line and then pay for your food plus a drink if you order that too.   This location seems to always have fresh food and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food. Good ppl. Panda always does the job  but no more panda. Health reasons"}
{"text":"Quick, fast, affordable and tasty Chinese food.  I ordered the two plate combo, orange chicken and a beef choice.   The two item is enough for two people or two meals in my opinion.   It had been a while since I had been in a Panda Express but if memory serves you could get rice, chow mein or half and half.  For some reason whoever served me that day said they didn't do that  and I had to choose one or the other so I chose chow mein and was charged extra for the rice.  I thought maybe their options had changed so I emailed the company and was told that is definitely not the policy and if I wanted half rice, half chow mein it is included in the price and I shouldn't have been charged.  They were nice enough to send me a free coupon so of course I will frequent this location again but I don't plan on paying extra next time."}
{"text":"Panda has definitely stepped up their game through the last few years. I haven't been here in quite awhile but decided to step in for a quick lunch. This is a very busy location so expect to wait a little. Luckily the workers are usually pretty quick to keep the assembly line flowing. All the workers are very nice and always offer samples to try. The prices are very fair too, since the portion sizes are pretty large. You can get a large meal and drink for under $10.   There is a ton of options to choose from and they are always adding new items. All the the ingredients seem to be more fresh then I remember. The vegetables are crisp and fresh. You can taste that they are not frozen. I got the sweet fire chicken, broccoli beef, steamed rice, and cream cheese rag-goons. I'm Not a fan of their fried rice which is why I get the steamed rice and it's very good. Both the chicken and beef were very tender and the chicken batter was light and crisp. Everything tasted fresh and was hot. The cream cheese Ragoons dipped in sweet and sour sauce is so good. The wonton is crispy and the cream cheese is so rich. Perfect treat to your meal!   Overall everything was very good and I was impressed by the quality of food for just a quick Chinese take-out spot. I will definitely be back. I even buy their sauces that are sold in our local grocery store to create my own dishes at home. Thank you Panda for a great lunch. See you again soon."}
{"text":"The best Panda Express is Las Vegas. However there is always a line. Every other Panda Express in Vegas make their orange chicken to spicy for my children but this location makes it perfect and is very generous with fortune cookies. Just wish they would pick up on speed of service."}
{"text":"It feels like a regular thing now, they screw something up pretty often...aye! The food is decent to good, it's an americanized asian food, but slow service  and they mistakes.  Maybe it's because theyre so busy, i dont know, but i tell the girl 3 times \"half n half\" and I get a full side of rice, aye! Will I go back, sure, like i said, the food is decent-good."}
{"text":"OLD and DRY. My family used to come here all the time. It is the closest one from our home so we would always come here when we wanted chinese food. The last couple of times we came to eat here have truthfully sucked. The food tasted old and the chow mein was drier than usual. This last time we went was the worst. The food looked and tasted very old. The rice and chow mein was old than all the chefs there. As if that wasnt enough, the soda from the drink machine tasted flat/diluted. We couldnt even wash down the bad food with a nice cold drink. My family will not be coming back. Overall, I would not recommend this location and would advise you to spend 5 more minutes driving just to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for some quick Asian food. The orange chicken and General Tso's chicken are great. I always go for the half and half fried rice and chow Mein. The only thing that is weird are the amount of questions you get asked at the end. No joke, it's 5 questions that I am sure they have to ask, but the answer is always no. After a while, it's almost comical because they keep adding questions."}
{"text":"Decent fast food Chinese food. It's close to the house for those I don't want to cook kind of nights. I will go back since the food is always good at this location."}
{"text":"So yummy! Lucked out with a fresh batch of orange chicken. Employees were so accommodation & nice. They gave me a complimentary drink, since I had to wait 1 min for fresh spring rolls. Best panda express to date. Wish there was a drive thru!"}
{"text":"I do need a Panda Express fix from time to time and this location has the most consistent food from any other I have visited. The store is always clean and the staff always friendly and go above and beyond. Several locations try and give you the last of wha is in the trays but they have offered, on a few visits, to have me wait for a new batch to be made. This will be my go to Panda for sure"}
{"text":"The most disorganized fast food place in the s.e. 16 foot selections 6-8 are always empty. Food is good just gotta wait long time."}
{"text":"What a HORRIBLE experience. I had to go to this location twice and wait 30 minutes after I ordered to come home and find I still had not received all the food I paid for. This location also does not answer their phone so I can apparently only speak about my poor experience online or in person to the store directly.  Here are all the details for those interested:  When we arrived, ordering was pretty fast since it was slow inside the restaurant. We paid not too long after arriving. The chow mein was out and still cooking so we had to wait for our plates which wasn't an issue. After about 5-10 minutes, they brought out our food and we left the store. We didn't think we would need to check our order since we had waited for awhile, but I guess that was a mistake. We had ordered a medium orange chicken entree and 2 egg rolls which were missing from our bag. We turned around and went back to the store and requested our missing food which they apologized for. They gave us a small drink for our trouble and said they would have it right out. Well, they were out of egg rolls and had not yet started cooking a new batch so it did not come right out. We waited another 10-15 minutes for the egg rolls to be dropped and cooked. Then it sat in the window for a few minutes before one of the workers noticed and then finally brought them out to us. We left the store with our food at 6:05PM. 30 minutes after we finished paying for our food. But wait, there's more!  THEN, we got home to eat and opened our plates and found that one of my entrees from the Bigger Plate we ordered was also missing. I tried to call the store 3 times and each time it went to voicemail after ringing 5-6 times. I left a voicemail and it's been almost an hour with no callback. I'm now left with no other option other than to go to the store in person to obtain what I've paid for since the store doesn't answer their phone. It's incredibly frustrating that I will now need to go to this location a 3rd time to receive what I ordered. Mind you, I only ordered a Plate, a Bigger Plate, a medium box of orange chicken and 2 egg rolls...   If you go here, triple check your order like I should have before leaving.   Side note: if you come here to the drive-in within a half hour closing (as they close the dining room a half hour before close), don't bother. They stop cooking and will essentially just let you choose from whatever entrees they have left. I came back for the wonderful experience described above because we were unable to get what we wanted after going to this location 30 minutes before close on Friday night (with 4-5 other cars in line at the drive-thru). We waited in line and pulled up to order when the worker said they had very little left and we could only pick from 4-5 entrees that they had left for the night. So we left and decided to go back later in the weekend...  Needless to say, I would advise you to take your money and business elsewhere, because I sure will after this weekend."}
{"text":"Was walking outside planet Hollywood and found this Panda. Ordered the single bowl you get a menu item and a side order for a total of seven dollars.  A family meal can be ordered for $9 for three items. This is cost effective fast food. They let you taste the food before you purchase. The size of this restaurant is small but service is same excellent service and food tastes great. I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Good Panda Express in a good location in Summerlin, near the Smith's, Home Depot, Pet Smart, and the Yogurt shop.  Seems fresh, and always clean and tidy.  The people working here are nice, too.  The lines can get a bit long, and it seems a little logistical organization would not hurt."}
{"text":"Decent Panda Express in the tony neighborhood of Summerlin. Just feels more organic when you are eating on the rich side of town.  Same offerings as at all of the other Pandas, though.  Tends to be fairly neat and clean, and well-organized. Never thought the customer service was awesome, though."}
{"text":"Poor service at drive thru.  You would think that they were cooking steaks for people, the amount of time it took to serve."}
{"text":"The staff was incredible however it seemed like the AC was broken and was incredibly hot considering its summer time, you don't want to eat somewhere you'll be uncomfortable in. We took out food to-go"}
{"text":"This location gives very small portions, the customer service is lacking to say the least. The tables where not clean and I noticed the two managers just standing to the side eating and joking around. Where is the no star button?"}
{"text":"If you want to be treated rudely by people then by all mean go to this location. And ask for Ida she'll treat you like crap and lie to your face. I wish I could give them NO stars!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Kong pow chicken -  barely any chicken and barley any Kong pow, chow mein had way too many vegetables could barely enjoy the noodles but I did enjoy the *managers special* shrimp. place is clean  & quiet but the food is only about a C-"}
{"text":"Rangoons were cold, rice was dry and old as was the noodles.  Worst of all service was very slow."}
{"text":"Charging for refills is very 1999. Hiding the dispensers behind the counter is an even more archaic practice.  Since it's a casino with little traffic during the weekdays you can expect most of the entrees to be in the steamed holding pans for hours on end which leaves you with old food that is in a constant state of degradation only for condensation to flow over and keep it in a constant state of limbo, much like quadriplegic on life support.  That's not really a fault of the employees, just the logistics of the business."}
{"text":"I have stayed away from Panda for years, I remembered it being terrible.  The whole family had it catered for Mother's day because it is my Mom-in-law's fav, and I was REALLY impressed! Placing the order was easy, picking up it was on time, and the food was surprisingly really good! I am looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I wonder which Brilliant 'Suit' made the call to moce the entree pans closer when they run out of certain things, yet dont move the description tags. Who hired this idiot? Why would you want to confuse potential new customers that may not know what they are ordering? This is one of the most retarded procedures I have ever witnessed! Been coming here 3 times a week for a couple years, dont think I'll be back now after I sent an Asdistant to get something and they thought they were ordering right."}
{"text":"I've attended this establishment at least a hundred times over the past few years, and I've always told my friends and coworkers of how I love the Panda family. \"That they had never done me wrong.\" It nearly brings a tear to my eye, knowing I will no longer be able to spread this good word.  When I came to them and in the direst of needs, each member of the family spit in my face and asked me to leave. What kind of family restaurant doesn't trust their customers (I used to think it was more of a friend type deal) to pay them back, after they ask to be allowed to order, even though they've forgotten their wallet.  Furthermore, the good people of Bangkok Thai would never do this."}
{"text":"Food is decent but it seems like every time i come here, i have to wait, and i dont come here very often.   Still waiting...  I suggest the one in the best buy parking lot."}
{"text":"Place sucks wait time is retarded. Only one employee working and ever one sitting around looking at each other. Find another location!! Run for the hills. And with the over priced chicken !!!"}
{"text":"I love Panda Express. The crew is always prepared and the food is always fresh. I feel welcome every time I wank in the door and the staff is quick to help you out. Never had to wait to be helped. It's very easy to find. Unfortunately it's always packed. The lines are long. I sometimes have to take it to go because there is no seating. But it's still worth the wait. There's only a few parking spots so that sucks. The fact that it's so busy is lame too because I sometimes find myself in able to even find somewhere to park! And half the spots are frickin handicap spots anyways! There always empty but I find it extremely inconvenient since there's nowhere to park. It's pretty lame. But one time I got served old orange chicken. But they replaced it so that was nice. And they always have a smile on their face. Yummy ahhhhhhh!!!"}
{"text":"I come to this location often.  The women that work here are awesome and because of these girls doing such a great job, this is my favorite panda Express location."}
{"text":"The worst ran restaurant I've ever been to.  They have one teenager taking orders as others just stand around in a daze.  There was only one person in line to, hate to see it if they got busy. After waiting 10 minutes and still not served I left.   They had no food left anyway.  Stay away if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"Went here to purchase a soda. Asked the cashier if I could try the soda first since the one we got last night was flat and we didn't feel like spending money on a flat soda. The ever so rude Gemma made little comments like \"oh like we're wine tasting here\" or when I told her that the three different sodas I tried were all flat that id prefer a bottled soda she said, \"so I wasted a cup.\" Really unnecessary. First of, the cup didn't come out of her pocket. Second I told her prior to purchasing it that I wanted to try the drinks, so it's not my fault she grabbed a large cup already.   The previous night my father in law purchased food and the food tasted like it has been sitting all day and was never replenished. The breading on the walnut prawns were chewy and not crispy anymore and the veggies were soggy.   I won't be returning to this location ever and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Not even for a drink. Two days in a row the drinks were flat. Small portions with old tasting food. No thanks."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat. Was kindly welcomed by the new hire (in training posted in his shirt).   When it came to check out. It was a disaster. They did not have ice cold Izze. Which was fine, so I asked for a cup of ice. I was given a water cup (small). When I asked for a larger one as my drink does not fit into that one, the Asian lady looked at me and said we don't do that, and that I must buy the beverage cup.   I believe that should of kindly offered me a larger cup as was their fault they did not have any cold ones left. But instead made me feel like a big hassle. I definitely do not want to return to this place."}
{"text":"Wow tried it again this time went after lunch rush 130 pm wow 3 entrees  where empty and was wanting 2 out of the 3 but picked another one. And the lady said they could make the one I want  wow the cook gave the lady helping me a dirty look and took his time first finishing moping the back  the service of the counter lady was great but the cook was the worst . I will not come here to this panda ever"}
{"text":"I am actually a fan of Panda Express just based off of their orange chicken. I grew up eating it as a kid so I have always liked it. Of course, you can definitely get better Chinese food at other places but for the cost and the quickness of service, it holds its own. I really like to mix some soy sauce and some of their hot mustard with the chow menu. It's gives it some great flavor."}
{"text":"For a quick fix it's good but don't  come at 5. A line almost out the door one server, one cashier"}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this by saying I love Panda Express.  I have been to them all over the country.  I was so excited when I heard Mentor was getting a location.  However, after eating here, this is not up to par with any of the other Panda's I have been to across the United States.  The food here is actually verging on terrible.   We went inside to eat and they had just ran out of two items I wanted, I was okay with this because while I had to wait a little longer I knew it would be fresh. I ordered chow mein, sweet fire chicken, and an egg roll.  The only thing that tasted okay kind of, was the egg roll.  Both the chow mein and sweet fire chicken were just made, so I felt assured they would be good, nope.   The Chow Mein had zero flavor, was soggy, and not good in any shape or form.  The Sweet Fire chicken was overcooked, rubbery, and dry. I barely ate any of either item.    Do not come to this Panda for your first Panda experience, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food. Okay service. Every time I've been here it gets busy at different times and hours during the day even at night when they are about to close. I don't know why this place is always packed."}
{"text":"With as many times as I have been coming to Panda Express I finally remembered to check in! Today I went with my usual one entree meal which included half in half fried rice/ chow mein and a side of orange and teriyaki chicken. I do like the quick convenience of getting the meal in a supply chain line! The food was as fresh and delicious as always! I also do think they have the best tasting passion fruit iced tea!"}
{"text":"Eh. Bleh. Mmm..   I thought I was going to like this place. It is located in a nice area, near a shopping center that has SEVERAL other stores.   When we came in about 4pm there was a long line. I enjoy long lines. Why? In my head I am thinking \"yay, fresh food!!\" My boyfriend was the one actually groaning at the fact it was busy. But, it moved fast.   Too fast.   I felt like I was rushed when ordering. I don't come to Panda Xpress often so I was hoping I could look at my choices. Unfortunately, for me, the guy was writing down my food choices to pass along to the other employee so I didn't want to hold up the line. pluuuuusss, the customers in front of me where hogging up the food window. Like, \"excuse me, miss. Scoot your touch please?\"   That's another thing. PEOPLE THAT WERE HERE ARE FRIGGING BLEH. They either stare, stand in your way or there are obnoxious children screaming while parents don't care. I know it's not panda's fault, it's probably just the area.. I don't know.   Anyway, I ordered chow mien and black pepper chicken. The noodles were greasy but the b.p.c was on point! We ordered a side of orange chicken and it was delish. Sweet n fluffy, the way I like it.   Since it was packed just watch out for your receipt. The girl at the register charged us for a plate when it should have been a bowl. Too fast, like I said."}
{"text":"Panda Express is a \"cheater.\"  When you use Panda Express gift card (with money in the card) at this restaurant, they will tell you that the system is down and you cannot pay by gift card.  However, you can pay by credit card.  Then why people buy gift card from Panda?"}
{"text":"Terrible!!!! Got lunch from here few days ago. Orange chicken was too sweet to eat ( I've had it earlier and I know how it tastes) and beef pepper side was too bland, chewy and tasted like flour or something. I will never eat here again! A waste of $10."}
{"text":"This was my choice for lunch to go last Wednesday.  I have been in this location at least a dozen times.  It always seems to be pretty busy (and noisy).  Today I chose the Sweet Fire chicken and the Honey Walnut shrimp, both items are not on their standard menu.  As usual I got the chow mein with mine, it is easier to eat with chop sticks than rice.  The food and service were fine and I was definitely full when finished."}
{"text":"I had an internet coupon that was only good on Friday for a serving of one of their new menu items.  What better opportunity to review a newly opened location.  This is one of their newer stand alone buildings.  Inside it was arranged differently than an end cap which gave a more open view of the kitchen as you wait.  And boy did I wait, the person 2 people in front of me got the last of the orange chicken.  The new layout gives the orange chicken double billing as opposed to being equal in chafing dish size in the older arrangement.  The big woks really are not used for much of the cooking until the end.  I watched them start several items, including orange chicken, and they are poured from a big plastic bag of frozen whatever into a pan on a scale.  Them many of them go into the deep fryer.  When they are done then they go into the wok and the sauce is added, quickly tossed then put in the chafing dish.  I was surprised to see that as I cook the same way when doing a stir fry, even though I often cook each item in my wok they each will get set aside until all are done and I drain off the oil and put everything in and add the sauce just letting it cook long enough at that point to get hot.  The new item, sweet fire chicken, was ok.  In general Panda is ok food that is consistent from store to store. And inexpensive.  I think I like some of small strip mall places we have here just as well if not better.  This being a brand new location everything was spotless.  It would have been nice if my coupon covered more than $1 of my meal."}
{"text":"I definitely am a big fan of the panda express chain, and just so happens 2 be closest 2 my house. :-)"}
{"text":"I live near this location so I eat here a lot, but every time I go in there, there is an Asian lady serving customers that so rude and short with me. She never has a smile on her face and looks like she hates her job.  Plus I asked her if I could order a panda bowl with half orange chicken and bejing beef...to which she growled \"NO\" at me...come on, give me a break it's a bowl. You can only put so much in it. I guess it's too much to ask of her to put a little less chicken in it and give me a couple pieces of beef.   Well, I guess to think of it...maybe she's not capable of making logical decisions...she is after all working at a Panda Express"}
{"text":"This Panda Express is the one located in Town Square, south of the Las Vegas Strip in between AMC and Yogurtland.  I went with some of my friends to this location on a Saturday night before watching a movie next door and this place was packed. Walking in the place was filthy. All the trash cans were overflowing and the tables were topped with pieces of noodles, rice and spilt sauces =T I understand that it was a busy night but there were so many workers in the kitchen and not one out maintaining the front.   I stayed in line and ordered what I always order at Panda, tofu eggplant and orange chicken with half noodles and half brown rice. As people in front of me ordered I noticed each one complaining that they weren't being given a fair amount of food for each of the sides as well as the noodles and rice. They were nice enough to add more to actually fill the plate, but you'd think that after a few complaints they would realize that they doing something sketch. When it was my turn the server did the exact same thing everything was half full lol (shaking my head).  I gave them a one and a half star because the food was fine but because they had brown rice I gave them an extra half =]]"}
{"text":"The staff here is really friendly they maintain the dining area clean always, the food is always fresh when I come in, HUGE  fan on the tea bar here. Favorite drink is the honey dew smoothie highly reccomend it."}
{"text":"I'm still checking out the area around my job looking for fast lunch time eats, and this time I was craving noodles, chicken & pineapple, yes I know it's a strange craving, but it's one I knew Panda could satisfy!  Coworker and I got there at high noon on a Friday and there wasn't a line in site, guess we are ahead of the lunch rush, which was fine by me.  I ordered a 2 item combo with chow mein , firecracker chicken breast & sweet fire chicken breast. I have to say the sweet fire chicken breast is my all-time favorite; I have tried many times at home to recreate that flavor! Just delish!   I have to say that customer service was nice and friendly, and if you don't want to get out of your car, they have a drive thru too!  I still have many places to try out for a fast lunch time eat, but I know when I have a craving for sweet fire chicken Panda is right there for me to run to!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty. Friendly staff, they didn't rush us, even though there was a steady line. Tables were clean, food was fresh."}
{"text":"When in the mood for mall grub this Panda Express beats the band. Food is always fresh, with friendly timely customer service. For a Panda Express this franchise deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express but this franchise seems to be struggling. When I first came to this branch the food was really good, but now the food is mostly always dried out and they are starting to skimp on the portions. I will start going to a different franchise when I am in the mood for Panda Express for awhile."}
{"text":"Just tried finishing our meal from this Panda Express.  Unfortunately, the two dishes and the noodles we ordered were dried out and almost inedible.  We hadn't eaten Panda Express for a few years because of this ongoing problem, until some friends brought Panda to us after our daughter passed away.  It was really good so we decided we'd give it a try again.  Our first experience was good - the food was fresh.  Tonight, it apparently had been sitting in the pan waiting to be used up.  We won't be back.  We'll go back to ordering from a \"real\" Chinese restaurant where they make each order fresh.  Sorry, Panda.  No more."}
{"text":"Wow just wow. It's a Wednesday and not even that busy. Out food. 20 min wait. Trash full. Tables dirty. Huge line. What are they thinking??"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Cheaply made marble tabletops are dangerous and the manager will blame you for them breaking.  I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"If you come to dine inside avoid parking on the south side of the building.  The drive thru line is very slow and you will be blocked in.  The overall layout of this establishment is horrible.  They don't have a grasp on the concept of a drive thru. I have been in line for over 20 mins and still 4 cars back from the menu.  The food is the only thing we come back for.  Ill give them the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars since they have only been open a week or so.  They have a ton of work to do to get to a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Generally speaking I like Panda Express, but this location is very impersonal. The employees don't look at you when they are helping you with your food, they don't look at you when you ask them questions...and sometimes they will look at you when you are paying for your food. But don't try to ask any questions because they react like you've just asked a complicated math equation...when really you just wanted chop sticks."}
{"text":"I was on the way home from work and originally planning to stop at Blue Fin to get my Asian fix on.  But they had to close due to a leak in the city pipe, the street was flooded.  BOO!  As I was driving home, I was racking my brain to think of a fast food Japanese.  BLANK...  nothing.  So I continued to head towards home until I saw the Panda.  Ok, it is not Blue Fin but it will have to do for now.  Got the orange chicken, mandrian chicken, and fried rice.  I know, it is NOT real Asian food but nothing good out on the West side."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy this place for quick meal on the go. Food may not be authentic but it's tasty. My big problem with this fast food place is the checkout clerk never listen to you. The last three times I have been here I have asked to please have some of the Hot  Chili sauce packets and I get home and open my meal and guess what nothing there. My visit tonight was the same again. Now I do understand that a fat, rude, disgusting family was in front of me in line and that created chaos for the staff and everyone in line behind them. That should make the employees more attentive to the needs of the customer behind the rude pigs but it seems to be without fail that the polite customers to follow are always the ones to get the lesser service in the end. I say put the Hot Chili packets out in front of the register so the client can get them themselves.  If the employees don't listen then take it out of their hands so that the customer can still get what they need regardless of the employees or the rude patrons before them."}
{"text":"Never coming back to this location. There's this Hispanic guy that works at this location. He's the cook , and  he was taking the orders because the cashier was in the restroom. He took a guys  order and he took out some of his beef from his order and added more broccoli to his order.. The customer didn't say anything but he did seem bothered. When it got to my turn he barely added chicken.. He added 4 pieces of chicken and a lot of veggies. I asked him politely to add more and he was disgustingly rude and said it would be a dollar more. I asked him why if he barely added 4 small pieces  of chicken  its supposed to be 4oz of chicken and veggies and just veggies alone. So I told him never mind and he was saying rude stuff as I walked out. They need to teach this guys proper customer service because he just lost this company around $15 dollars worth of food/drinks over one dollar plus a customer for life. 09/08/16 10:30am"}
{"text":"As I write this review, I have been sitting in the drive through for close to 25 minutes waiting for my meal. This is the slowest place I have ever been. It's called Panda EXPRESS but after sitting 25 minutes in the drive through , Panda Express should really rethink their name. Every time I have been to this location, it has been at least a 10 minute wait for grilled chicken teriyaki . I would not recommend this location for anyone that is looking for an \"Express\" meal."}
{"text":"The drive thru has been broken for 2 weeks. You suck.    Out of rice, Kung Pow and Mushroom Chicken"}
{"text":"If I could do zero stars I would soooo rate this Particular Panda Express a big Fat Zero!!!!  As I walked in I noticed a smell, you know that smell when the mop was left soaked and they tried to mask the odor with pine sol or whatever and you can only smell the nasty mildew ish smell?! Yes at that point I should have walked out.  It was 8:30pm on a Tuesday and well I didn't wanna cook. I was debating on what to get to eat. I noticed the rice looked too light and fried rice has a bit of color aka taste. I regret going thru with this order when my gut clearly told me walk the $@%! Out!!!! As I was paying I saw one employee spill a hot soapy bucket of water all over, this place just didn't seem clean I think I'm gonna call the health department to do a surprise visit and bust the manager allowing this to be. My review doesn't end here. I got to my car and took a bite of the orange chicken that I waited 3 min for, wow I could taste the nasty taste of tap water they prepared it in, I was just like wow this is just food poisoning waiting to happen!! I love Panda and have Never had food taste this crappy, a new manager is needed an OCD Clean one. Stay tuned for my update review..."}
{"text":"Horrible food quality! Picked up dinner there tonight. Old and stale chow mien, old eggs rolls. Cream cheese Rangoon's awful! Stay away from this restaurant! Nothing was fresh. Take more time and hit China a go go instead."}

{"text":"I normally eat here but my last visit was so horrible I will never go back, the honey walnut shrimp had a severe chemical taste, it was like someone either dropped a cleaning product in it and just left it or the serving dish it was in was not properly rinsed after being sanitized. The Beijing beef was extremely burned and my chow mien was cold. The guy behind the counter apologized that it was his first day before I even received and paid for the food, i never complained about anything or even looked frustrated he just apologized out of no where. After getting home and tasting the food I seen why he was apologetic. I waisted my money cuz I threw it away in fear of ingesting something toxic"}
{"text":"This Panda Express is the worst of all pandas. They show favoritism toward Hispanic and Scotty (I think his name is) is very rude. If your Hispanic they are very friendly, courtesy and give a lot of food but if you are anything else... beware of the rudeness. This location only hires Hispanic because they speak in Spanish which is rude when your dealing with English speakers. Scotty needs to work on his customer service and his rude attitude. Greet customers with a smile, it goes a long way."}
{"text":"My complaint is the old Asian lady that works the cash register here. I work in the mall and whenever I come to Panda for lunch or dinner I always get a military discount. However, anytime she is working she refuses and tells me they don't do discounts  a military discount is not selective. You either give one or you don't, and when you are a chain you don't get to decide because it should be company policy across the board. I let it go multiple times but not anymore. They either need to let everyone on their staff know that they give one or don't!"}
{"text":"I love the food. Best place in the world. I suggest that everyone should try this place"}
{"text":"If you are staying in PH Westgate (aka Hilton Elara) and looking for cheap eats in between your clubbing and gambling escapades, Panda Express will get the job done on the cheap.  The food is greasy enough to protect against some of that alcohol, and this location is open until 2AM."}
{"text":"I bought food for dinner in the afternoon since we would be at home tonight without transportation. 2 of our orders had teryaki chicken. When it was time to eat dinner we realized they forgot to put the teryaki sauce on the grilled chicken. I called right away and their phone lines were acting up. After several calls, Sabrina decided to call me back and let me vent. She offered to deliver us some sauce if we were near by. I had to accept and was greatful. The kids were willing to wait and she was here in 5 min... More places needs employees like Sabrina, she's an asset to your company."}
{"text":"I've never tried Panda Express until this location opened up. I've eaten there a couple times now and I've never been disappointed with it! The first two times I ordered the orange chicken and it was very good! It was also crispy which I love! The last time I was there I got the sweet fire chicken and oh my gosh, so good! There's a lot I wanna try there, it all looks good!   The only problem I can come up with is the noise level inside is a bit crazy. Every time the employee asked me something I had to make her repeat herself because I just can't hear anything in there. Even asked the employee checking us out if she could throw some extra sauce packets in the bag and she at first said no. We both looked at each other puzzled and she asked 'wait, what did you say?' So I repeated myself and she laughed and thought I said can you throw the stuff in the bag away, like in the garbage. It's just too loud in there but the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"My first time at Panda Express. My wife and daughter had been here before and brought home some samples for me to try. So My wife had a gift card we she and I decided to stop for lunch. It was about 1 pm on a Saturday and they weren't busy when we walked in. I was less than impressed with the experience- There were 2 people in front of us and only one employee working the line. There was someone working the drive through. My wife had mentioned that they ran out of Fried rice last time they were here. (I judge Chinese food places by their fried rice) While I watched the drive through employee come and take FR, the guy on the line was taking it (it was disappearing before my eyes, and no one was acting to get more made) . Of course, by the time it got to me, \"Oh look, we're out of FR, you can wait 10 minutes and we'll bring it to you.\" GRRRRR  (Note to PE-You are basically running a buffet. When something looks like it is running low, you make more before you run out.). My wife has here food in her hands we get to the register.  The employee asks about drinks. Sure I would like a refreshing, fresh brewed Ice Tea, that you have on your board for $1.70. He looks past my shoulder, then over his and says to someone behind him. \"Are we still making Brewed Tea?\"- The answer was no, but I could buy a bottle of tea for $2.20 GRRRRRR. We took the bottle. Found a table- there were many empty ones, but some of them hadn't been wiped off-GRRRRRR. My wife started eating her lunch. My food finally arrived. The FREID RICE was hot, but flavorless, this was white rice , with peas, carrots, microscopic particles of what appeared to be eggs, and maybe  a splash of soy sauce and not much else, certainly  not flavor. GRRRRR. The ORANGE CHICKEN- Orange? Orange? This was chicken in sugar sauce,  maybe they walked the chicken through the orange grove on the way to the slaughterhouse. No, wait, that would have more orange flavor than this did GRRRRR. Beijing Beef-Finally, a tasty dish, the beef had a sweet, crunchy coating, a little heat. This ones a keeper. Unfortunately,  both the Chicken and Beef were cold when they came out. So, as I was chewing my food I bit down on something hard. had to fish around in my mouth and finally pulled out a black piece of plastic, about 1/8\" long. I looked at the end of my plastic fork. It broke off of the fork, must have happened when I stabbed the plastic to try and cut the Chicken or Beef-Glad I didn't swallow it. GRRRRRR.  My wife had a $10,00 gift card and it cost us $8.00 more and I don't think it was worth it. Sorry"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go when I want a quick bite ! My parents asked me what I wanted for my birthday dinner and I said Panda Express! Love it!"}
{"text":"Went tonight around 5:15 for dinner. My husband ordered teriyaki chicken which of course they were out of again. When he asked to speak to a manager about it ( this is the third time in a row it has happened) we were told that there was no manager, they were off today. A woman named Paloma said she could help. She was super rude. My husband said he would have pepper chicken instead so she got it for him. Once we got home we found that she only gave him three small pieces of chicken and the rest was veggies. My walnut shrimp was not crispy.   Sad because this location used to be decent.  UPDATE. I changed my review from 1 to 4 stars due to the manager and his response when we went back to speak with him. His genuine concern and amazing customer service turned this situation around."}
{"text":"This location is the closest to me that has a drive thru. And being a mom on a late Friday night, I didn't feel like getting super fancy to go stand in line, so I came here. After about ten mins waiting in the drive thru, I got to the window. The girl working it was nice; adding my last minute chicken egg roll order. I get home, and I live near 35th and Camelback, to discover both my plates were wrong. I normally chop it up to the usual \"fast food workers don't check before handing out food\" and deal with it, but both plates were filled with food that me nor my husband like at all. So I give them a call, the lady on the phone was curt and short. I told her I would be there in 20 mins to get my correct order. So I make the drive again. I got the same nice window girl.   But I guess my big complaint is that in that whole ordeal, I never got an apology, or an offer for a coupon for next time or anything. I work in the service industry and I have for years and I always try to fix the problem then give some incentive to come back.   Overall, I don't expect 5 star, white table cloth restaurant service at these places but I do expect basic customer service skills.  I'm giving 2 stars because my correct order was delicious"}
{"text":"One thing I hate is to order two side entree meal that contain meat and they give you a plate full of vegetables. Like we're is the meat, if I wanted a veggie plate I would ask for it and pay the price for veggie plate. I don't want to count out 4 pieces of meat and just eat onions, bell pepper, or broccoli. That's just a waist of my money even for the price you pay for the entree. The chow mein was to soggy and didn't tast good. The beef was dry and hard to eat, It was just a whole meal waisted. Not sure if it was just the location or what. I will try another location next time to see if it will be better, or if it's all just the same. Not so happy with this visit so I gave two stars for making the food look like it was good, smelling good and clean organized work station."}
{"text":"By far the worst Panda Express in town. The manager Consuelo denied one of my coupons for the free entree that was expiring in 10 days. I suggest going up to the mall at Paradise Valley's Panda Express instead."}
{"text":"Staff is unfriendly here.  I pulled into the parking lot and was getting out of the car.  It was 850pm and the sign said open.  One of the staff members pushing a garbage can said we are closed, \"no mo\" I asked aren't you open until 9?  He said yes, but the last people are in the drive thru now and that's all.  Your sign says open, but you say closed?  I guess you're more concerned with going home for the evening then my business.  Poor representation of your company.  Plenty of substitutes.  I'll stay with Pei Wei.  For a buck or two more, the service is superior and no comparison between the two."}
{"text":"Great food, great price and great service! Teriyaki chicken is PHENOM! Come on people the quality of this place is obviously the highest among all the Chinese fast food places."}
{"text":"Service is horrible the girls just throw the plates. They don't care at all about the food, service or customer! Don't bother going to this location! Get better experience and food at the Dysart location"}
{"text":"Update:  Received the response from Alex M. (see below).  Again - MORE THAN HALF of the items were not available.  There are other reviewers that state the same issue - food not available.    This is not the first time I've experienced this same issue.  I'm usually up around 3:30 a.m. every day and am ready for lunch earlier than most people.  The expectation is that if the restaurant is open, you will have all the offerings prepared and ready to serve.  I've been there in the mid-afternoon (2:30 p.m. 'ish) and food was not available - namely the steamed veggies.  I was told it would be about 4 minutes and they would be ready - 15 minutes later I'm still waiting, already consumed the others items from my meal, so just left without ever getting the veggies.  This location is just poorly managed / operated.  With all the hassles in finding a parking space, coupled with the lack of food availability, it's just best to look for somewhere else to eat....  Original Post:  Just went in to have an early lunch - more than half of the items were not prepared. They've been open for over 30 minutes and don't have most of their selections available. They told me they could fix the items I wanted but it would be about 10 to 12 minute wait. If you're open for business - have the food that you're supposed to have so that customers like me can purchase it - that's really simple!"}
{"text":"My husband stopped at this location on the way home from work, nothing prepared.  This was about 5:00 on a Friday, when many people don't want to cook.  I asked for brown rice but none was prepared.  The workers were pretty much playing with their phones.  No one was preparing anything.  What I ended up with was burnt fried rice, honey walnut shrimp, and ragoons.  Looking on the receipt I was also charged also with orange chicken, which was not given. Not going back to this location ever.  This experience was pathetic."}
{"text":"Nice, convenient option when the normal fast food options are not desired.  Entree choices are plentiful, and taste samples are kindly offered.  Most of the choices are far from qualifying as healthy eating, but you might find a few basics.    I observed heavy usage of  deep fryers .  Some of the entrees come frozen and are then  dumped right into the fryer.    They list caloric info next to each item.   Some of the entrees were very dried out and needed to be  rescued from the heat lamp.  Supportive staff, and a  comfortable dining space contribute to the postive points.  Lots of \"thank-yous \"and \"pleases\"were heard between each staff member.  If given the time, choose going to a buffet since the price, quality, and entree options certainly outweigh a meal here."}
{"text":"The food is what you'd expect from a fast food chinese spot, but they ALWAYS forget something at this location. Would you like any sauce? Why yes please! *opens bag* no sauce, no napkins, no chopsticks or utensils, sauce from food spilling over sides of container....errrr thanks guys..."}
{"text":"This is probably once of the nicest Panda Express I been too. As soon as I walked in the employee cleaning greet me and then the girl working behind the counter also asked me how was my day going. While serving us she smiled and was patient with us not knowing exactly what we wanted! Food is never a disappointment(:"}
{"text":"Not impressed! The portions are small. The carrots in the vegetables tasted awful. I got one half slice of zucchini and 5 mushrooms in the mushroom chicken. Half of the seating is in the sun."}
{"text":"I'm starting to understand why there's no stars on this location! This is the third time I've come here for lunch at 11:50 and they have more than three or four items completely empty with none of them on the grill. Then you ask how long is it going to be and they tell you 10 to 15 minutes very polite service but when you're limited to options on lunch you can't sit and wait 15 minutes. Third time this month! I'll be going elsewhere Here.  Lol tried a 4th time and same story! Outa 4 items, what a joke. Seriously will not return!!!"}
{"text":"Never have we felt more unwanted at a restaurant. We walk in on christmas eve at 6.10 sharp when they close at 7. No greeting, well heck... Then there are only 4 dishes left which were what you would call left-overs. And he explains awkwardly that they're almost closing, hence no more cooking. Uh? What? I mean i'd understand if we walked in 10 min before closing but not 50 minutes, especially at a fast food joint. It gets even better, my wife later told me that while I was ordering, the clerk that was sweeping rolled his eyes at her. And since there was not enough orange chicken they had to make more so my wife had to wait. Which was fine, but when I got my food and sat down more people walked in and the clerk and the cashier looked at each other irritated. It was so unprofessional. And as these people were ordering, more people came and. And of course as the only thing that they had was orange chicken they ordered that. So the new batch got served to the people that just walked in while my wife was still waiting. My wife saw that they were serving the chicken so she got up to see why she's not getting hers, the clerk said 'oh sorry, I forgot. Don't worry' he said as he pointed to another waiting customer and said 'he is waiting too'. Didn't we come in first in order and pay first? So as my wife went up to ask they gave her a small plate of about five or six small leftover pieces, and asked her to wait for the next batch. And what do you mean 'don't worry', did she do anything wrong here? After 10 minutes they gave her the, literally, 'rest' of her chicken, in the smallest to-go box they could find. If I knew that a-holes like these two were working, I would've driven as far as I needed to, to another location.  Simply WOW! Forget about this place."}
{"text":"Came in during my lunch time around 2:30 PM ordered myself a plate of chow mein, honey nut shrimp, & mushroom chicken. The food was delightful and it did satisfy my stomach. But what caught my attention the most was as soon as I came out of the restroom a female and male employee came out of the males restroom at the same time! They both had a smile on their face when coming out. It was very unprofessional and disgusting especially your coworkers are working hard and their was a big line of customers waiting to order and pay."}
{"text":"the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever had at a fast-food restaurant.  I arrived at 8:45pm and the place was packed.  3 employees on the line and 3 cooking.  You could tell they were working hard to get everyone served quickly.  I ordered egg rolls with my meal, and they had just sold out.  It happens.  He asked me if I minded waiting for a fresh batch, and I told him it was no problem.  Well, it did take a while for them to be ready...to the point that most people might have started getting mad.  But, here's why I was impressed:  #1.  I have no idea who the manager was.  Everyone was on their game to get it done and you could tell that they genuinely cared.  #2.  While I was waiting, they apologized and I knew they meant it.  Two of them asked how my day was.  #3.  I was offered a cup to get something to drink while I waited (I hadn't ordered a drink).  #4.  When I left, he said:  \"I'd like to offer you a coupon for the next time you come in.  Since you had to wait as long as you did.\"  It was an unexpected but nice touch.  In times that it's so easy to get pissed off about things that are beyond anyone's control, it's great to see that people actually care about serving customers."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and thought panda express would be a good idea, but I was very wrong. Came in with my family about two hours before close, and they said they weren't making rice anymore and didn't have fried rice OR white rice. The black pepper chicken we ordered was cold, and the service was probably the worst I've seen in any panda express. They only had one girl working the line and the line went by really slow. The only good thing about this location was the orange chicken, was really good, a little spicy. Tables and floors were clean."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. The lines were backed up and although there seemed to Be probably 8 persons on duty it was still understaffed.   The workers seemed miserable as though they were working during the super bowl. I wasn't warmly welcomed and I didn't get a smile from anyone.  I ordered the largest plate but was given a medium. I had the lo mein, mushroom chicken and the orange chicken. The food seemed dry but my biggest complaint is that me and my friend were both sick afterward. I don't have a weak stomach, as I like to go to fortune star maybe once every 2 months. I've never been sick going to fortune.   I really won't be back"}
{"text":"This place has tasty food . All fresh vegetables are cut that day and quickly cooked to order in a wok nearly as the orders come in. .It Does not have  Quick service and, it has a few major problems.  1) The portions are very small they serve you on Styrofoam plates so at least they could give you more than a spoon of each item . 2) They need more people working this would make the service faster. 3) Prices come. on there is no server no host . no cloth napkins,No Gothic forks and spoons like and Richard Blais's Burger bar in ATl.  this is fast food.  I am not a cheap person I have paid over a $100.00 for lunch and I do not live in a 3 million dollar home in Huntersville where this location is.That maybe why the prices are what they are .              The food is tasty but order 2 meals for each person unless of course your a skinny B*** then of course you would not be eating anyway."}
{"text":"I was starving. I was broke. I was leaving Vegas. After staying a nice weekend there, we left our hotel at 11am, hungry. We stopped by the mall and were just buying some extra things for ourselves before go to eat. We went to the food court and I spotted Panda Express. Man, I love orange chicken. I won't eat anything but orange chicken. I hate teriyaki, sushi and egg rolls. Only orange chicken makes me crazy. Desperate for some, I told my boyfriend I wanted to eat there and he agree. I ordered my favorite plate and sat with it. Mmmmm the smell.... And then, the taste. Delicious. And spicy. It was burning my throat. I started to drink water. And more, and more. The more I ate, the more I felt like not eating, and it burned more inside. My boyfriend, used to hot salsa since he was a kid, tried and said it wasn't spicy. Duh. I am not used to freaking spicy food and I hate anything spicy. I was soooo mad.... I can't complain of the service, but the food.... the food sucks! 2 stars for service.  ps:I wasn't smart: I thought that, perhaps, only this Panda Express had spicy orange chicken. And tried another one. Burned again."}
{"text":"This is last ditch option at best. Not sure what's going on with this place. Food is not consistent, slow drive thru service, employees seem unhappy and always have to check to see if your order is right before driving off. Again, tasteless rice and missing items in order."}
{"text":"Always had our order right and the people are very friendly especially the blonde girl on Friday evenings, the wait times have never aggravated me to anger"}
{"text":"The hours posted are not accurate and really should be; especially if you drive out of the way to one of their locations assuming the hours posted are correct and they aren't. Real disappointment."}
{"text":"Unpleasant, rude customer service, drive-thru sucks, Long waiting time, not recommended location for people in rush."}
{"text":"My son was craving rice since we left Hawaii.  We were driving to Target and saw this location right across the street.  We were happy to order fried rice for our son who loves Panda Express. On our last night in Phoenix we went back here and got in around 9:55pm they were already closing and the trays were empty.  The person working said we can order anything and they would cook some for us.  This is the first time we've been to a Panda Express when they offered to cook something.  All the locations we've been to in Oahu never make more even when we ask if it's close to the closing time. We were so hungry we asked staff if we could eat there and he said ok.  We were the only 3 people there.  We didn't mind that they were cleaning we just needed to eat because we were so tired and had an early flight the next day back home. All other Panda Express locations should have same standards about making food for customers even when it's close to closing time."}
{"text":"This Panda Express in campus is awesome. The employees are nice and quick. The prices are okay but I understand considering it's on campus."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday, had my two dogs in the car. It was a SUNDAY at 5:15pm, there was 1 car in the parking lot and 1 car in front of me in the drive through.  I waited like 3 minutes to get to the ordering spot, once there the girl said \"Can you hold on for me a quick second?\" So I said sure.  EIGHT  (8) MINUTES later I was still waiting, so I said \"Hello?\" and she came back \"Can you hold on for me a a quick second?\" so I said \"You said that 10 minutes ago, a quick second has come and gone.\" and drove off.   How ridiculous !  ONE car in the parking lot and ONE car ahead of me.  I will NEVER go here again."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. This was my second time coming here & the first time I was here, the service was very slow. Okay. My second time here...not only was it very slow (again) but the employee putting my order together had such a nasty attitude. HORRIBLE customer service skills. It took about 25 mins to get my order & they still messed my order up. The food wasn't even bad but the whole experience was less than desirable."}
{"text":"Lots of turnover and good location makes this one of the better Panda's in North Phoenix. Service is great and they are used to working fast as they deal with lots of corporate and school traffic at lunch."}
{"text":"Very bad Panda. Don't come here after 8 or the meat and broccoli will seem rotten. Always extra greasy and unsavory. Drive down to 59th if you must have it."}
{"text":"I had forgotten to take my lunch to work one day this week so I decided to order online for myself and a coworker from Panda Express and go pick it up since it is so close to my work. I ordered a two item plate with String Bean Chicken and Honey Lemon Chicken with half lo mein and half fried rice. When I got there I could not believe how busy they were. There must have been at least 10 cars in the drive-through and another 30 people standing in line inside. Luckily I had placed my order online so I was able to go straight up to the cash register. After a little bit of wait they finally got to me and did not have my order ready yet despite it being almost 10 minutes past the time I was supposed to pick up the order. However the girl quickly went to assemble it and I was on my way. The food was OK and what you would expect from a fast food place. No complaints."}
{"text":"Horrible. I paid extra for an additional dish of steak and shrimp it usually comes equipped in a mini box well she put it on a mini plate and it was like one piece of steak one piece of shrimp and one bell pepper. I was so mad that I was going to pay more $ for that sorry additional dish. The rice is now brown rice and no one mentioned it I just noticed it tasted funny. The window shade was broken at the table I sat at and it was ridiculously hot too. My daughter was going to share with me then decided she didn't like what I ordered so I told her to go over & get something she wants for a to go order and they took forever and had other adult cut her in line because she's only 12 and figured they could take advantage of her. I was pissed I kept going up to the counter and said is everything ok. They said yes that they had to cook rice because they ran out. I said well that wouldn't be a problem if you wouldn't have let all those adults cut my daughter in line. So she had to wait and got cut in line. They deserves a free drink or something. Nope not from them. cheapo's ! I will go to a different location if I want panda express again."}
{"text":"This place is a joke..  And the blame falls entirely on the staff and manager  Major problems we experience every single time we visit include  - Entrees empty, or mostly empty waiting to be refilled  - They have maybe 1 of your choices, which they package up for you, but then tell you it's another 15 minute wait for the rest of your options. So half of your meal is fresh while the other half is cold or room temperature  - They stop cooking at least 30 minutes before they close the store even though this is probably against head office policy. This location is run by lazy ass teenagers and they claim they stop cooking so early because they don't want to waste food  - Every time I've been here, they are making people wait excess amounts of time because they are completely confused or in the weeds  - Crap service, never an apology or coupon for times where I or other people have been forced to walk out empty handed  - Portion sizes are wildly inconsistent. Sometimes you get a decent amount of food, but other times, they are lightly \"spooning\" the food portion ever so lightly into the box to give you an absolute minimum amount of food, and it's most likely because they are trying to stretch the entrees out to feed more people without having to cook more.  Teenagers are the worst for this.   The list goes on,.  It's a shame because if they could just get this location under control i would happily update this review  But I won't hold my breath.   1 star from me"}
{"text":"drive thru is a plus but be prepared to wait.. Also if you like soy sauce or chili paste, make sure you ask for a certain amount. if you say \"a lot\" because you know that you alone will eat 20 packets, they will only give 3."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through. Very fast and friendly service. The food however is dry and tasteless. The chow mein noodles are dry, no sauce, texture is hard and completely flavorless. The fried rice is equally flavorless and not thoroughly cooked. The spring rolls, also zero flavor. I wish I ordered delivery Chinese and stayed home. Waste of time and money. I wish they opened up a Pei Wei instead. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip!  Awesome service from the staff, especially Tasha!"}
{"text":"The best part about Panda Express, unfortunately, is the location with plenty of parking.  The food looked tasty and appeared fresh. Taste was very uninspiring.  The egg roll was mushy and the  fillings were difficult to discern.  The veggie spring rolls were crispy on the outside, the insides were mushy and pasty. The pictures on the website look like different products.  The fried rice was oily and flat on taste.  The orange chicken was heavily sauced and felt  oily also.   Overall an unsatisfying heavy greasy meal that does not hit the spot.    The facility itself was clean.  Ordering was easy and organized.  The menu was easy to navigate.    A huge plus is they have the calorie content on the menu and their website."}
{"text":"When this store opened it was great! You had to wait a while due to the crowd but if you get at the end of a long line you expect to wait. In the following months I have been extremely disappointed.  The first time I thought it was a fluke but three additional visits proved otherwise. First off the the Sweet and Firey Chicken was not cooked right. I can't pinpoint what is wrong because the chicken is cooked but the coating is off. ( this is my favorite dish and have had it many times ). On my last visit we had a larger order and had to wait, which is fine but when I got home I had the wrong food. I looked at my receipt and I was overcharged.  I returned the incorrect food and the manager knew the issue as soon as I returned however she was less than apologetic. A polite women,I believe a supervisor, told me I could keep the incorrect items and they would replace my food but the other manager then took the food and threw it away before I could respond.  Now I didn't care about the wasted food (not something my family would want) but i found the action to be extremely rude. I also had to have them refund me for the amount I was charged in error and again one of the girls was very polite but the the other manager was extremely rude. Remember they knew they messed up before I came back and told them so I am not sure why I was treated so poorly. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this location has anything higher than a 1 star rating. The staff is the rudest I have ever encountered in the food service industry by far. I've tried on a few occasions to \" give them one more chance \" and I just can't get past the blatant attitudes and sub par food. If you want decent Chinese food, go some place else because you're not getting it here sadly."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I'm frustrated and frankly a bit angry.  I ordered online and it said it would be ready in 21 minutes.  I showed up at the appropriate time and was told they were making my order now. It was very busy and the line was to the door. Everyone got through the line and then some. 20 minutes after waiting at the store I asked what was going on.  Mind you, I've waited a total of 40 minutes for my food to be ready since putting the order in. The guy told me they were packing it up now. Five minutes later and there was no sign of it being ready. I asked him again & let him know how long since the order had been placed.  He asked if I wanted sweet and sour sauce and told me that's what they were waiting on. I replied that if it meant I had to wait one more minute, please don't include it in the bag.  I had to go or I'd be late to our practice. Guess what!  I waited another 5 minutes before they gave me my order. You would expect someone to come and apologize for this huge inconvenience or to offer a free entree or a something to say how sorry they were that I waited close to an hour at a fast food restaurant.  Nothing.  Just a rise in my blood pressure, my son having to eat in the car on the way to practice, and a big lump of disappointment in my stomach.  There are better fast food places, people.  Just keep driving when you see this one."}
{"text":"Panda is consistently good and fresh,  that's why they are always busy! Gourmet Chinese it isn't,  but you can't beat the friendly workers and consistent fresh eats. My new favorite is the honey walnut shrimp. I usually get that for both choice."}
{"text":"I went in to order, the couple in front of me was letting their kid run around, when I yelled at the couple after the kid ran into me, apparently that made every uncomfortable. We called the police, the couple left, and this place still refuses to give me the corporate number. Last time ever. Thanks Officer Marquez!"}
{"text":"Panda gets THREE times as many stars as Pick Up Stix. That doesn't mean Panda is great, it is what it is.  The husband was starving and we hadn't been to the grocery store yet and Panda is the quickest place that's also close to the house. So Panda it was.  Not bad, not great. I like the Beef with Broccoli with it's big chunks of broccoli...yes I like broccoli, sue me. And they even cook it right.   So if you're really hungry and in a hurry, Panda is a good bet."}
{"text":"This location has the friendliest staff.  They always aim to please their customers.  Ever time I eat here I order my food fresh from scratch and they do not have a problem providing it for me...no questions asked."}
{"text":"I eat here every Saturday because it's close to where I work and I can generally get in and out fairly quickly. That's thanks in large part to the staff that's there on Saturday afternoons. They know I only get 20-30 minutes to get in and out of there so if there's a really long line they make my order the minute they see me walk in (it's always the same) and ring it up when there's a break in the line. They also always ask me how my day is going and how busy the salon is. I really feel welcomed when I come in here and I very much appreciate it."}
{"text":"I eat here often and they have literally never gotten an order right for me. I like everything on the menu so I don't mind too much and it's just roulette. But today I got home to find that my wife's orange chicken is missing. Absent from her plate. Just a plate with chow mien even though I paid for orange chicken, clearly typed on the receipt. Kind of the final straw for me. If you mind not getting what you ordered or potentially not even getting anything at all in my case, you'll mind this particular Panda."}
{"text":"Party of One - two of us went to lunch but paid separately.  I had the Bigger Plate - 3 main courses and one side.  The Chow Mein noodles were dry and tasteless.  My friend had the fried rice and said the same thing.  The food area is like Boston Market - everything is out and you pick what you want.  Server got two things wrong in the order because she said it was loud and could not hear me.  I said Orange Chicken and she served me Grilled Chicken.  The Orange Chicken was good.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp was ok - but all breading and the Teriyaki chicken was good.  Her mushroom chicken was ok to good.    She got the spring rolls - same as the one's you get at Dollar Tree - we paid two for $1.95.  No sauce served with them.    I had the Cheese Rangoons - one was so overdone - dry and to hard to eat.  The other two were ok.  We did get sauce to dip in - but had used it on the dry noodles and rice.  Rangoons were $1.95 for three.    If you buy the \"up-grade\" meats there is an additional charge - $1.25 for the shrimp.  Servers were polite and pleasant.  So - half our food was ok to good.  The other half was tasteless, dry and hard.  Bigger Plate $8.50   Cheese Rangoons - 3 for $1.95 Lipton Lemon Tea $1.95 Up-graded meat $1.25  TOTAL LUNCH BILL $14.71.  Could have had a sit-down steak at Texas Roadhouse or Olive Garden for the same money and left happy.  NOT HAPPY - WILL NOT GO BACK TO PANDA EXPRESS."}
{"text":"This is a pretty busy panda express location, even with many variety of food choices in the mall. Service was fairly quick. I had the chow mein broccoli beef swtfire chicken. Food was fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"From AZ and never expected Panda Express to have this kind of service. One of the manger and two of the cooks were busy having an \"important\" convo beside creating my meal. Hopefully they get their act together because this is the only Panda Express around. thank you Erica for the refreshment while we wait on these slow coworkers of yours."}
{"text":"I like that the flavor at all locations are pretty much the same. The only thing I do not like is depending on when you go, some of the food has been sitting in the pan for awhile. I really like the chicken and string bean dish but the beans can be soggy. They do a pretty good job and it is fast."}
{"text":"I have been to many Panda Express restaurants throughout the country I have to say that their ingredients are good then the dishes are good but the execution at this restaurant in Avon is poor there is no taste to most of the meals there is a lack of organization when it comes to preparing meals and then checking people out at the register lack of experience poor execution doesn't matter how good the franchise's it won't work.  When you walk in most of the dishes are empty or old and not fresh. Very disappointing.  Have tried it now at least 10 times."}
{"text":"Grace's customer service honestly was poor. Didn't smile while assisting my family with our order but smiled and engaged the person behind us. And I didn't realize that 5 flavor shrimp literally meant you get 5 shrimps. Jesus the was the only friendly person which gave you guys two stars."}
{"text":"Love the drive thru concept since you don't typically have that option with Panda. The food was good & hot, the usual flavors existed! Only complaint with the drive through concept is you can't actually see them scooping your food so you can't tell if the portions are complete! I did feel my bowl was a bit low in terms of chow mein! Maybe next time I'll just go inside!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the serving size the chow mein was dry they forgot one of my entrees the girl piles it on for other customers and we got some guy that barely put anything in our containers. I need to find a better Chinese place"}
{"text":"I have to say they're really good  Very clean place  Grate customer service  Keep up !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came to grab dinner apparently during a very busy hour. The service was impeccable.  Every employee was busy making sure they were getting customers taken care of ( with a very nice attitude. That's something that's hard to find in a restaurant) They were very kind and attentive. I experienced how a nasty customer was so rude to one of the employee (the manager May) and she kept her cool and continued working with a huge smile on her face and a great attitude. Love this environment.  No matter how busy the joint got all of the employees made sure to work together to take care of business. Management is doing a great job at this establishment! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"This is located in the local area mall.  Only had a few people in front of me in line and it was moving incredibily slow.  Overall food was good.  How could you go wrong with Orange Chicken?"}
{"text":"Filthy!  Tried to eat outside and the tables were sticky and  one was covered in fried rice.  Went to the bathroom to wash up and no paper towels.  Facility needs better management.  Oh, and whenever I go through the drive-thru, I am offered a sample but never given one. Why offer it?!"}
{"text":"even though it was busy during this visit, the staff were all very attentive to everyone. the food tasted great also. not a big fan of the veggies but they were tender. the string bean chicken breast and grilled teriyaki chicken were very good, cooked well, and good portion size."}
{"text":"If you ever wonder how bad fast food can get, come to Avondale. They've put us off Panda Express indefinitely due to: 1.) Incompetent help 2.) TERRIBLE food 3.) Creating the impression #1 and #2 are what people want, apparently in lieu of food. And yes, we've contacted mgmt."}
{"text":"The Shiitake chicken is pretty good. Will order again. The location has good service."}
{"text":"Employees were kinda rude, uninterested.  The food was good but the staff acted like they didn't want to be there.  Having said that, this is a nice cheap option on the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum!!!! I came here today for dinner with my hubs and I am already craving more. I asked him if we could come back tomorrow night. He said yes because Panda Express is not only affordable, it is delicious. I like to get the chow mein even though it is not the healthiest dish on their menu. That's why I also got the shiitake kale chicken breast. Delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at panda. As always the food was great. But we really enjoyed meeting the manager. He talk to our kids, gave them toys, and really engaged with the customers. He was awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't know why the website says it closes at 11 and that is still open and when you go there at 10:30 they tell you is close, that is terrible make people drive al the way here just to close the door on their faces"}
{"text":"Yesterday i go to this location and buy rice and 5 flavor shrimp and all night i was so sick i was so close to go to the hospital and im still feeling bad i will never ever go again on that place"}
{"text":"Have the opportunity to stop by here and pick up some food on the way back to our hotel while in town. Although this is a chainstore you do find the same items and all the locations, the question is will you find the same quality at all the locations. We did find that the quality was very good, The service although was not exceptional but was very good. The only reason we did not give this a five star rating was upon us entering the location the floors seemed very sticky, like something was not as clean as it should have been. We were impressed on how fast we were in and out thus giving a four star rating. If you're in the area and looking for a quick meal with good quality panda express is one of those places."}
{"text":"Wow, what an incredible meal we had here the other day while visiting Las Vegas. It is not often when you get your mail to go, did you arrive at back at your hotel and take the first bite and realize this is the freshest panda express food you have ever had.  We were looking for a quick place to eat and take back to our hotel room and enjoy a nice quiet evening we found out there was a panda express about a mile from our hotel which made it very nice and easy for us to go pick up our meal. Upon arriving at the location there was plenty of parking in two entrance to choose from to enter the location. Upon entering this location we had a short wait for other customers the place their order, upon placing our order was done very fast efficiently and with a very big smile from the employees. We were able to pay just as quick pick up some chopsticks and soy sauce and of course y'all famous fortune cookie. And then we were on our way.  Once we arrive back in our hotel I opened up our food and begin to eat and enjoy a nice relaxing evening it was upon that time I realize the food that we were eating was so fresh and so tasty that this location became one of the Favorites for us. We would have to commend all the employees and the franchise owner of this location for doing a fantastic job and making sure everything was fresh for not only us but for other customers that came to the location. We hope this was not a one off event and this is the way they conduct their business every day we look forward to coming back to this location in future trip."}
{"text":"My very first time at a PANDA Express and the server was very helpful. He told me the best deal was a side and two main dishes. Then he said I could get two half sides so I chose white rice and fried noodles. Both were ok. Then I got the teriyaki chicken which was excellent and the crab Rangoon which was ok. The price was fantastic. $7.20 for enough food for two meals."}
{"text":"Perfect! Staff was friendly and offered samples! Loved the new sesame honey chicken. This location has the soy sauce out for your convenience. Some can be stingy about that. Food was hot and fresh. Delicious dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Just ate there waited for 1 entree for over 10 mins the workers didn't really care smirking as I told them something..food is always good ,the service SUcKS..if you don't like your job you should probably find another .!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in during a weekday for lunch. IT WAS PACKED. Nice chipotle style lineup where you pick your side(s) and meat. The line took a little longer than expected because they seemed to be out of food and people were waiting for it to be made.   Got the last table in the place! For the amount of food you get in the bowl I think it's well worth it! It was maybe $5/6 and I couldn't eat it all in one sitting.   Had the Orange Chicken with noodles. The noodles were dry and not that good, I think I'd try the rice or veggies next time.   Other than that, the chicken was good and all the other meats looked fresh too.   There's not much out in that area (minus the avon commons) so if you're out there, I'd give it a try!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service. They were so rude I had to walk out. Didn't seem very interested in serving me at all. I felt like I was bothering them."}
{"text":"I really like their food, however, I was presumed to be coupled with the man behind me even though I was a single customer. In their haste they forgot to ask if I wanted sides, I asked for crab puffs and my request went unanswered. I am bummed out that I have to go home without my crab puffs."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd and the last time. We tried it when it 1st opened and it was pure chaos at that time and food was ok, 2nd time still just ok 3rd time still just ok. Much better out there. The  big thing that makes me want to not come back is food it always on the cold or luke warm side. I dont even understand how that can happen and they still be open due to food safety regulations not to mention wgo know gow many people may have gotten sick. Its also not very clean.. concession area is a mess, restrooms are a mess and the glass on the door is disgusting. I understand they get busy but today was the dirtiest and the least busy we have seen it."}
{"text":"Clean friendly fast and good seating are hallmarks of this chain. Even the beggarsbeggars ant ruin thethe ambiance here.  Food is great. Always something new to try & none of the fare ever looks tired.  I had the King Paolo chicken and my friend had the mushroom chicken. Pics to follow."}
{"text":"The worst Panda ever! Very disappointed with this location because the people here has not clue what is going on? Empty trays? Who's running this place? I'm not coming back ever!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, food is cooked in small batches so is fresh. Chef special does not have premium sticker but they still charge an extra 1:50. This misleading signage cost them an extra star."}
{"text":"Ick - remember when Panda used to be fresh and good? The good ones are hard to find. I hate eating hard and old orange chicken. I also hate seeing their food sit and get old and gross, and feel bad for the desperate customer who gets that nasty food. You should try to make fresh when possible. Filling all your bins with food to sit doesn't make your food more appealing. Hot n Fresh does....I've walked in and out after a visual inspection of their food.  Alejandro, you need to direct message me first as a business in order for me to reply to you. Once you do that, I'll happily reply with my number etc and will re-visit this location to see if my feedback has encouraged a change. I love to see places to well and grow. I write fair, true, and detailed reviews to ensure each business knows their growth or their value to me and to whomever reads the reviews I write. I do appreciate the reply back, it shows the first step to making something not so great to better. So Thank You for the reply."}
{"text":"Panda used to be a great place to get quick Chinese food. I haven't been to a good Panda in years. This one served hard as a rock orange chicken and the rice taste pretty old as well. Not the freshest food."}
{"text":"Drive through window girl was incredibly rude on two separate occasions. Food was ok."}
{"text":"WORST Panda Express I have ever been to. I wanted teriyaki chicken but the chicken they had did not look edible at all. It was a pale brown so I asked if I could get fresh chicken. The girl said it was fine that it would take about 7-10 minutes. I waited 20 minutes for my food my mother was done with her food by the time I got my teriyaki chicken. And while I was waiting they ran basically out of everything that the line was out the door from just waiting for food to be ready.  And to top it off they were giving people who ordered after me teriyaki chicken before me! Do not recommended to come during busy hours!"}
{"text":"I must be the village idiot because I always get an intestinal condition (D-word) when I eat at Panda Express. But I was hungry and it was a very late lunch and I thought it would be fast. I had Bejing beef and rice bowl. The beef was so over cooked that it was like dehydrated space food left over from an Apollo mission (that was a while back). The rice was so over steamed and mushy, that it was like mortar. I used to eat here often because sometimes I want vegetables, but no matter what I get here, I get Diarrhea. Yep, I used the \"D\" word. And it's every time. And it's been enough, that I am positive that the condition is not from something else. Today, I felt sick to my stomach all day and kept burping up the nasty over cooked dehydrated beef. So, I'm officially done giving them \"one more chance\". The tables are often not cleaned and the servers are more interested in servicing the drive through, so you have to stand for a long time before getting served, and once you do, it's hit or miss whether or not the register person is able to get you through the line without your food getting cold. And heaven forbid you get there right at the top of the lunch hour because it's almost impossible to get through there without standing forever. And if they tell you an empty dish will be out in \"three to five minutes\" which is their standard quoted time frame, just know it could be 10 minutes, and the rest of your food could be cold by then."}
{"text":"if i could give less stars i would. good service badddddd food!!!  orange chicken was disgusting   you didn't leave an email address or any way of reaching you..."}
{"text":"This was the worst Panda Express I've ever had ! My sister warned me not to go here but me being the fat ass that I am, decided to go anyways. The fried rice wa clearly old or burned and the white rice was too clumpy to eat. They continue to mix old food with old food and had no fresh meat besides the orange chicken. And to top it off I PAID 8 dollars! Thumbs down, panda."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their service. Jess was very rude and not professional. It should be expected for a worker not to roll their eyes at a guest. Another worker thought it would be a good idea and come sweep right under our feet while we're eating. The food was great but the service was just disappointing."}
{"text":"First PE in SE Calgary in the 130th ave shopping area.   This location is very clean and has plenty of booths and tables.   Staff has been hit and mess with their service.   Menu not super clear in regards to what a side is when you do your meal (side is chicken fried rice or noodles).   The food is average and can be good if it is fresh from the kitchen and not sitting under heat lamp of the presentation area. Pricy stand alone restaurant but no one serves you.   Self serve pop machine.   Overall if you want Chinese fast food can't go wrong but it's not cheap."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and service and food is very good.   Selection is good for what these Chinese fast good offer.   Lots of seats and self serve pop machine.   Very clean and bright restaurant as it's the first one in Calgary.   Overall pricing is on par with other fast food and you can't go wrong here when Chinese food mood strikes you."}
{"text":"I placed an online order to pick up at 9PM, got there and the store was already closed. And they still charged me. Worst business ever."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! I will NOT be returning to this location, and i would NOT recommend this location  to anyone.  Walked in staff was slow when it was our turn the served us half of the usual amount and when we asked if they changed their amounts the lady rudy said \"no,its 1 scoop like it always has been\" ( we had witnessed her serve people before us with a larger amount) we let that go and kept on.. when we ordered the second plate she served the same amount and when they finished with our sides they put our plates on top of the glass that covers the food and moved on to the next plate. We moved on to order ragoons and every staff member  ignored us so i asked the cashier if we can please get a side of ragoons with the sauce and she rolled her eyes and placed 3 ragoons in the bag and threw them on the glass that covers the food and proceeded to assist another customer that had just walked in for an online order, we were confused because we were ready to pay and she was already working with another customer while we were being ignored. I noticed that the ragoons were sitting on the counter so my husband grabbed them and asked the cashier for sweet and sour sauce that goes with the ragoons, she rolled her eyes and asked for payment and said she would get it. we payed and she still had not gotten the sweet and sour sauce so we waited and she continued to help the online order customer they asked her for a order or ragoons and sweet and sour she told them yes and walked back to the food to get them the ragoons and sauce so i reminded her that i was still waiting for the sauce and she rolled her eyes at me and took care of the online order customer so i waited till she was done and when she came back to the register she asked for the next customer to pay and so i kindly asked her for the sauce and she told me she was busy helping other customers and that she couldn't get it for me. She said \"you can ask them for it when their not busy\" At that point i was tired of waiting i had already purchased food for my family  & was not going to put up with her attitude so i told her never mind. She smirked at me and proceeded to tell the other staff what happened while we sat and ate. I also noticed they served every person after us a larger quantity and when they ran out of noodles they were taking from other peoples sides that hadn't got their order to accommodate new customers.WORST LOCATION & waist of money for their rude service and food. It didnt even taste like anything compared any other panda express.    Michelle M. Was our cashier.  seemed as they didnt care about anyone or anything."}
{"text":"Awesome Food, Service and Ambience!  It feels more like casual dining than fast food!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the manager Yanti is always friendly and attentive. Thank you Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Bad news first: 1. Confused on the portion size and didn't get enough. 2. Not the best selection during the dinner rush. 3. A rather hectic ordering experience overall. 4. I was really looking forward to Chow mein and it wasn't like I expected it to be, noodles were very dry (maybe it is supposed to be like this, not sure)  Good news (!): 1. The main dishes we got were pretty tasty! The meat seemed like it was a very good quality and cut. And the spring rolls and cream cheese rangoons were great as well. 2. They gave us tastes which was great since we've never been there before. 3. Fast service  I would come again since the food was good, but I will probably get rice instead of chow mein. And I would definitely come during a different time of day to avoid a rush and to get a better selection."}
{"text":"the service was great, accurate, fast, neat, very kind, and the restaurant was also clean with no dirty tables, and lot of customers."}
{"text":"For a $1.25 extra for Shanghai Beef, I got the SMALLEST scoop and all veggies no asparagus though. THEY FORGOT SOY SAUCE, NAPKINS, AND FORTUNE COOKIES. Never coming back again. The chow mein was greasy and the orange chicken over cooked. Ugh. So disappointing"}
{"text":"I'd give it ZERO if I could!    Service big fat ZERO! I waited forever in line behind a family that couldn't make up their minds. I order a small box of orange chicken.  That's it! I am standing there after I order at the counter waiting...two employees are waiting on the people behind me...and I am standing there. Put my chicken in a little box and take my money...but that's too difficult for the employees here because they were so concerned getting the order of the people behind me correct. I could have said hey I am here wait on me but if you have ever seen me in real life I am not hard to miss. I walked out.   I WALKED OUT!!!!!!!!   I went out to the parking lot and called the manager from my car. I told him that I walked out because I was left standing there while they waited on the people behind me. He asked if I got everything? What? I got nothing. How do you not understand this? I told him why I walked out and that I would go to another location.  He said okay NO PROBLEM!  Um... Excuse me?  I corrected him and said no we have a big problem, I called you first of all because I think you deserve to know why people are walking out, second of all, I live around the corner and I am being inconvenienced. What about this makes you think there is no problem??  I would never dream of reviewing Panda Express regardless of the food, but service that bad NEEDS to be addressed.  A sorry would have been nice. The manager said he'd talk to his employees I'm sure he won't by his flippant attitude."}
{"text":"After 3 attempts I think im through with this place. First time chow mein was burned. Second the food tasted like it sat around for a long time and the third it just wasnt anything special. I am not sure if this is because they are not in that great of a location. This wasnt my first experience with Panda express. I have enjoyd their food at other locations just fine."}
{"text":"Before writing this post, I came to this place a couple of times recently.  Here is my experience. My last visit it was nearly to closing time. There was a customer in front of me who was making her order. The chef; Jimmy stepped up and took my order. My last three visits he has done this. Very atentative to the customers and willing to fill in the gaps to help the team on shift. Friendly and overall great customer service!  Again, I came here nearly to closing time and there wasn't much food out but Jimmy assured me that he would cook anything fresh if it wasn't there. Which he did and wasn't bothered to serve me what I requested.   That's all I want as a customer! Good customer service, respectful, a clean restaurant, and of course good food. This location can deliver that.   Keep up the great work Jimmy!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Panda Express in a while and was craving some chow mein.   I decided on a bowl so as to not get enough food for multiple meals, lol.  There were a lot of different entree items that I hadn't seen before & I decided to try the Firecracker Chicken Breast. I was warned up front that it was really spicy, which made me want it even more :D  I have to say, it is very tasty and it does have a little kick. Definitely my new favorite!  When in doubt the staff encourages you ask for a taste :)  Location is clean, staff is friendly, lots of parking available."}
{"text":"Standard location for the chain. Orange chicken was cooked well, the rice was a touch undercooked a little crunchy in parts, the chicken egg roll was tasty.  Staff was friendly and moved the line quickly and easily.  The place was very clean even though it was right around lunch time and busy.  They kept up on the cleaning while we ate as well after patrons would leave and the tables weren't up to par.    Overall: B+ It's not gourmet (I think you probably knew that before heading in), but it's a good lunch stop!  =)"}
{"text":"One of the better Panda locations around town.  The atmosphere is nice due to its location within the shopping plaza and all the things that are easy to walk to before / after eating.  The staff was friendly and offered samples of anything we were interested in trying before choosing what we wanted to eat.    I ordered my regular two item plate with orange chicken and a chicken egg roll with rice. He tried the new sesame chicken and the orange chicken with rice.  The rice always seems to be off at these locations, just a touch undercooked everytime, but I always want it to be good so I order it.  No lessons ever learned.  Ha!  The place was very clean and everything was well stocked as far as condiments and the like.   Overall: A It's fast food Chinese, so I know what I'm getting myself into - but as far as the locations go, this one is definitely a good one to hit up when you have that craving."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have lunch at Panda Express, however this location is sad.  Very sad.  Normally the Panda Express experience is inviting, hip, fresh and satisfying.  This location is in dire need of some corporate attention.  The chow mien noodles are my go to and I usually have to always get the orange chicken.  The egg rolls here looked like they were from yesterday and were crusty, the won tons were not fresh and had the look of stones, as if they were morphing into Chinese throwing stars.  Gross.  I advanced to the point were I had to pay and I ordered a large drink.  I got the blackberry tea which was great, but... no splenda or sweet and lo.  Nothing at all.  I had to go back to the register and was only able to get sugar... which I did not want.  So I went without.  It was still thirst quenching.. but not ideal.  The whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area.  Even though I asked for dining in, they still packed me to go... was this a hint? or was it that they ran out of plates.  I think the latter.  I will say that the new grilled chicken breast with teriyaki was delish.  Let me state, I am not sure if it is all that new as I have not been to a Panda for some time.  I was saddened overall.  Just a terrible location."}
{"text":"Redemption... This particular Panda Express in the Peoria AZ area is leaps and bounds above the location off of Thomas St. (also in Phoenix).  I got the noodles, with some basic staple menu items of orange chicken, shrimp and honey walnut, beef and broccoli.  Cup for water, though if I wanted a tea, this location has a nicely stocked and clean drink area.  This location actually has plates so I was able to eat like a restaurant goer, with a plate.  I was at another location and gave me my food in the to go bag like a hobo. It is a great time of year in Phoenix, so I opted to eat outside as the weather is phenomenal.  As I was eating I was able to get a first hand view of an Peoria PD sting, someone was arrested and taken away in the adjacent parking lot.  I must say that I was surprised as the area seems a bit up scale and clean.  I did a Panda Express off of Thomas St that was in the hood and that seemed like the prime location for the police sting.  In fact I checked the violent crime map on my android while I was waiting. You just never know.   I enjoyed tossing a couple of chow mien noodles to some scruffy desert birds and enjoyed my food.   Even without the police activity(not the norm I am sure) I give this location a very high endorsement.  Food was fresh, decor clean, and well kept."}
{"text":"This location is great.  Clean and staff is friendly.  If you pay attention to my entire Yelp profile, I have been to several Panda Express locations.  This particular spot is in a newer shopping plaza and is in a high growth area.  I have been here four times, and each time I have not been disappointed.  One thing about the whole Panda Express concept is that if you do not like the looks of the entree or it looks old, ask them to make a fresh batch.  They will.  For a Chinese food chain, this location is great.  I only give four stars as they drink area needs more attention and they should stock Splenda.  So bring your own (this goes for all PE's)."}
{"text":"Holy moly. This place is a staple of American Chinese food. Have to recommend this place for everyone that is visiting the U.S. If you are looking for a quick bite and happen to be at a mall - look for this place. It's one the best Chinese food I've eaten. Everything is made crispy with a thin layer of sauce. I recommend the Beijing chicken - its my fav. But everything on their menu is pretty good. Even the side orders of fried rice and noodles. I know you guys opened a lot of stores in America but keep them coming! Maybe come north to Canada too?"}
{"text":"There was a guy named Sam and he was the nicest, friendliest, happiest person I have ever met at any restaurant ever in my life. He engaged in conversation with each customer before me. Sam seemed to really enjoy his job. I asked him for a smaller portion of chowmein because I hate wasting food. He gave me exactly what I asked for. When the next girl asked what entrees I wanted, she saw the smaller portion (which was still a lot of food) of chowmein and she was concerned because of the smaller portion. I explained that I asked Sam for a smaller portion of chowmein. I later spoke to Sam at the drink station and he just totally impressed me. If I owned a business, he would be working for me right now. He is a huge asset to Panda Express and I wanted to express my appreciation for how he treated me and his true concerns for doing an outstanding job."}
{"text":"Ok, went by last week and they ran out of String Bean Chicken and today they aren't even serving it!  What's the deal?"}
{"text":"I had come here often since it's near my office. I've noticed the past few months a decline in the quality and service. Today was by far the worst I've had. I ordered my food & waited after I paid. I finally asked where my food was & was told they were waiting for chow mien. Finally I got my food & they didn't put sauce for my spring rolls which I had ordered with the sauce. Very disappointed in service & rudeness of staff to myself & others waiting."}
{"text":"I'm really trying to figure out all the five star reviews from this place. It smelled good when I walked in and ordered my food. But I was surprised the lady taking my order spoke spanish and not a word of English...in Panda Express?!  The napkins were empty and the spanish speaking lady watched me as I discovered no napkins. I had to ask her to refill them. I also had to ask someone to clean the tables as there was not a clean table in the place.  The lady wet the seat so much I had to stand and hold my food while it dried.  I'm afraid to eat my food. What does the kitchen look like if the dining area hasn't been cleaned? Now a baby is screaming. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I like eating here - Sometimes I want to sit outside and cant!!!!  Too many children loitering after school, just sits outside hanging out.  They aren't even eating or drinking anything from that restaurant (ugh)."}
{"text":"Alexis was very polite when ringing up my order. Store was clean and all employees helpful as always. I always like coming here."}
{"text":"There are some places that I order the same thing 99% of the time...and this is one of them.  I always get the 3 item combo with:  Fried Rice/Chow Mein Orange Chicken Sweet & Sour Chicken Beef & Broccoli  This location is solid....fresh ingredients and quick service.  Will I return?  When I need a quick Chinese fix...sure."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and there is always an issue. This time they did not have 3 items ready and they told me I had to wait 10 min for each one to come out. The young lady had already rung up my order on the register so I told since I have to wait I would like to change my order. She said I can't change your order. I asked why she said my manager is not here. She called her manager and said she is on her way.  I asked how long before your manager comes. She replied I don't know. After waiting 25 minutes no manager so I walked out.   Other times I will order online and my food is never ready at the time scheduled. One time I got there 5min early before my order time and the manager said it's not time for your order and I told her but there is nobody in line I was the only one there.  Awful service and awful management. This place needs to go under new management.  Also you can't send feedback on The Panda Express App. It states error.  Tony"}
{"text":"This specific Panda location is the most poorly managed restaurant in the valley.  On three occasions now they have been out of many of the options right at dinner time, and when they ask if you are willing to wait 5 minutes for your food be aware that you will really be waiting for 20 minutes.  Employees don't seem to care about the ever growing lines as they don't have food to fill orders.  I'm never going to this location again..."}
{"text":"I feel horrible! Is it ok to give this place a good review? I mean I'm reading all these terrible experiences. Maybe it's me and I don't expect a whole lot or maybe This Panda has it's good and bad days? Fast & Friendly service. With good food at a nice price was what I got today. I really didn't expect much else. Was I suppose to? Anyways me and my family of 5 will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I normally come to this place because it's the closes to my house the servers at the front are nice and greets you when you come in but every single time i come here around 8:45 to 9 the food are all left over and dried up from I don't know how long they made it. Today, i came here at 9:20 and ask for  mushroom chix since they don't have it, the honey walnut shrimp that i like looks old and dried up so i ask if they can make a new one, the cook told the server then the server told me they can make the mushroom chix but not the shrimp because their fryer is already off, seriously?? I worked in the kitchen too and i know that the fryer only take about 5 mins to heat up, I know they close at 10 but it's not an excuse to sell food like they wanna sell plus its also an extra charge when you get it. What a lazy cook. I was disappointed and told them ok, i'll just go to the one by American pacific and the lady server told me it's no problem at all.. wow!! Obviously they don't care about the company making money, their just there to make their own money.. come in and leave and get their checks.. they don't realize they have a job because of the paying customers."}
{"text":"Always love Panda. Really good Chinese fast food. Orange Chicken is the best. Love the order online option."}
{"text":"Periodically, about every six months, I come back to give this location in BC a retry since I live here. Today a friend wanted to eat lunch here and she was paying so once again I gave them a shot at a decent meal. I'm not expecting a fine dining experience at a fast food Chinese restaurant but have had good, fairly healthy food at other Panda's. One may exchange the rice & noodles for veggies if desired. The problems with the food today was the same as my other visits, the veggies were old and dried out as were several of the entrees. They offered to cook fresh veggies which the pieces were too big, no flavor and still cool to the touch. The two chicken entrees were not hot or even warm for that matter. The chicken and the veggies as well as the sauce was all at an unacceptable temperature and just not worth eating. I'm feeling like this was my final try at a decent meal here at the BC Panda Express. BTW, spring rolls were cold, too!"}
{"text":"Nycole F gave me GREAT service! EVERYTHING was PERFECT!!! She gave me a sample of Treasure Chicken (my 1st taste ever - and I ordered some!) She was VERY helpful & attentive & friendly! She even coached me on how to save money on my order. (how to group & order things).  I think she was also the one who hand carried my previous prepaid internet pick up order to me in my car. I had called in advance (after placing my internet order). I explained I had the flu & didn't want to infect anyone, so I'd drive up to the Take Out door & flash my car headlights, & she came right out & handed me my order with a BIG smile!   THANK YOU, NYCOLE! P.S. The 8 Treasure Chicken was good EXCEPT for the black, burned peppers."}
{"text":"What would you expect of a Panda Express?  Pretty much it's the same as other locations, but this one is the only fast food around Eastern and Sahara and had a craving for some orange chicken, so since I was cutting the carbs, I got the bowl with veggies and orange chicken and I got a pretty serving on my plate!"}
{"text":"Understaffed for a Friday night, and the staff that was working were running around not knowing what they were doing. I was overcharged, and when I told the employee, she said, \"All I can do is refund the entire order on your card and re-charge you.\" No apology. Just attitude when she's the one who messed it up. My friend took the extra charged item, instead so they didn't have to refund it. Still hadn't received my food, because they packaged it in the wrong size. I was waiting and the girl didn't even finish packing my food or giving me the food. The other employee looked at me like \"What are you waiting for?\" The other girls who had rung my order up wrong and working on other things now, had never packaged my food. I asked to speak with the manager, and after trying to explain it to him twice (his English is broken) he said \"Ok I will speak to them?\" - like asking me. By then my food was packaged and I just wanted to leave! What a headache. Ughhh I won't be returning to this place and will never recommend Panda Express."}
{"text":"I went into this location the other day and the employees were beyond rude from the moment I walked in.  I ordered my food and the employee had an attitude with me, she had to make my order twice because she kept messing it up and had the audacity to get rude with me.  I also had to wait five minutes for them to make what I requested and as soon as she made my dish she gave it away to someone else.   I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"It's a Panda Express and you get what you pay for. Nothing crazy about this place. I recommend the orange chicken, Beijing beef, chow mien, and chicken egg rolls. There are better restaurants in the area at the same price but this is the best when you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service from Ana. Was very unpolite with customers because she was short staffed. Took it out on everyone. Gave me attitude and tried to charge me extra."}
{"text":"Service was friendly... food tasted like it had been sitting for a while. My shrimp walnut was mushy, not crunchy like it usually is."}
{"text":"We decided to stop into this location for dinner. We ordered the family deal for $30. We got fried rice and orange chicken. The food was actually very fresh! The service was fast and friendly as well. The establishment was clean, and the workers were very friendly. I'm very happy with this location."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food! Server was very attentive and efficient. With a terrific smile. The Gen Tso's chicken was very tasty. Chow mein is always fresh and yummy. This store rocks!"}
{"text":"I felt rushed when I was ordering. The lady who was taking my order was very fast but I felt like I had to pick what I wanted fast. So I just ordered the orange chicken and fried rice like usual. But I would have liked looking at all of the other sides and entrees. Next time slow down lady some people don't like being rushed."}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend and we got two bowls. I always get the sweet fire chicken breast as my entree and they give me a good amount of it every time. This time the guy who served us only gave me one small scoop. It was definitely less than I normally get, I could see the rice underneath, which I never can. I compared it to my boyfriends and he definitely had a larger amount of his entree. I counted 7 pieces of chicken. I was very disappointed and angry with that but I chose not to say anything.  Sadly, it only gets worse from there. I wasn't even halfway through the bowl, and as i'm putting a fork full of food in my mouth, my boyfriend tells me to stop but i already put the food in my mouth. He had to pull out a short, thick, black piece of hair out of my mouth. So that was that, and we decided to throw our food away and leave. We should have said something, but we're both too shy to say anything. Very disappointed with this experience and we aren't planning on returning to this location or any location for awhile."}
{"text":"Chinese food?  it is adequate.  It is a great value for the money spent.  They always offer samples and get you out of there in no time.  The places are kept clean.  Sometimes the food is not up to par.  I've experienced doughy chicken or overcooked items.  Can't really expect that much for the money.  It is fine for a rushed meal."}
{"text":"If you are familiar with panda express in the U.S. - YOU WILL BE GREATLY DISAPPOINTED.  Less portions at a higher price!!!  People at panda branches in the US make sure your plate is full to the point its about to fall off. Here they make sure you dont get more.    Prices are definitely higher than the likes of manchuwok and shanghai 360. They also want you to pay extra $1.49 for \"premium items\" like the shrimp.   A 3 item plate with upgraded shrimp entree and a drink came to $15. I know $15 isnt really a great deal but it is NOT VALUE FOR MONEY.   NEVER AGAIN. I'll just enjoy Panda on my next business trip or vacation to the US."}
{"text":"Going to Vegas, the last place I would be expecting to dine at would be the Panda Express in some random shopping center off the strip. I hardly ever walk to anywhere, but since I had to walk this instance after doing a lot of drinking, I had to get a bite to eat at this Panda Express.  You can walk to this Panda from MGM, and it would take you no more then 15 minutes. The things I would probably look out for on the way there are the porn handlers, and drunk dudes that like to get frisky.   Once you get to this location, its almost impossible to find seating. Since there are multiple fast food joints at this food court, all of the tables are almost always taken. An Indian family was nice enough to let us take a corner of their table to dine.   As far as service goes.. there is no service at this Panda. Imagine having to deal with strip traffic day and night. All of the people working there resort to being your high school lunch lady. Rice or Chow Mein? *slaps one scoop on your plate and keep on moving*  They won't even let you pay ahead of someone that was dining in. I ordered my order to go and about 99% of the time at other Panda Expresses, they would let me pay right away. Nope, not at this one. They need to make sure you get the full high school cafeteria experience.   Come here if you don't have a car, hurting for food..and this is a last resort. Otherwise there are plenty of better Pandas, or other options out there."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch.  It is 12:08.  No lomein  noodles for 10 minutes and no orange chicken.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Okay. No longer going back. The wait time is always 40 minutes or longer. They can't seem to get the TWO THINGS I ORDER CORRECT. Literally. Chicken breast. WHITE STEAMED RICE. and this time it was freaking cold so I'm late for work all for a wrong order and cold food. Worst Panda Express ever."}
{"text":"I don't like the teriyaki chicken anymore. Really miss ordering it. It was my favorite entrée sense I'm diabetic. They do not blacken it like they used too. Even when I ask to have it blackened they can never cook the way it used to be. I asked the cook manager why they stopped cooking it this way and he said that corporate wanted it lighter. It's cooked like it's steamed rather than grilled. Really I wish they would switch it back to the way it used to be cooked  and taste. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this Location! The staff is always friendly and smiley. They work quickly but not too fast! The food is always fantastic. It is better to go during the day than before it closes because the food is fresher. I go again and again and love it."}
{"text":"I just read terrible reviews, so I'm here to give them great ones, this is my favorite Panda Express. I had been trying this location for the last couple months. The food is always Fresh and I Always get great portions! Good for improving !"}
{"text":"Quick service. Manager very cool, staff friendly. Food was even above my expectations. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Panda Express isn't bad if you want quick and easy Chinese food.  The selection isn't bad and the price is pretty good.  I went here last night on my way home from work and they took BBQ Pork off their menu.  :(  I would have given them an extra star if BBQ Pork was still here.  Oh yeah, and there is one more thing I have to say about this place:    FIRST!"}
{"text":"Panda Express has friendly service, decent Chinese fast food, but the portions I received here were bigger than normal..  I love it when employees at Panda Express hook me up by putting a little extra food! Earns a star for me because to me, that is excellent customer service, and it never hurts to put a little more and be generous!"}
{"text":"I would expect when they say they open at 11 on Sunday's to be open at eleven and not have pushy employees that basically make me feel very unwelcome and tell me that opening has been delayed. Maybe they should put a sign up and lock the door so no one else comes in and feels the way I did. I took my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The slowest drive thru I have ever been in my life. Too bad it was only one lane so I couldn't hop the fuck out of there after 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Customer service was very terrible most especially the filipino woman named COOKIES! She's acting like a SHIT! Second, they put a little bit. I got orange chicken but it was only 5 pieces and got some brocolli chicken but mostly are just the brocolli. Got some kung pao chicken but only peanuts and vegetables inside not too much chicken. We we're so dissapointed we will never come back again!"}
{"text":"Just grabbed a bite here with my kiddo. It's ok. No big deal. Low on food and it doesn't taste as good as I recall. Quiet tonight. Perfect way to wrap up my \"weekend\" with my kid."}
{"text":"I recently went through the drive thru at the Blue Diamond Panda Express location. When I got home and opened my food (which was supposed to be string bean chicken with brown rice) what I found was absolutely repulsive. Old, mushy rice. Wilted, slimy green beans. Stuff that wasn't even supposed to be in my dish like mushrooms and zucchini. And absolutely ZERO chicken. They obviously serve the drive thru customers the old disgusting garbage that the walk in restaurant customers would never accept as palatable, digestible  food.  The reason why I'm leaving this review is because this is not the first time this has happened to me at this location. Obviously, they make it a practice to serve up questionable food to their drive thru customers, most likely in order to reduce food waste and keep their costs down. When I called I spoke to the \"manager\", Summer, who apologize to me but offered me no solution whatsoever. Perhaps the General Manager of this location should  rethink who he or she decides to leave in charge, and should serioisly think about re-staffing this restaurant, because it is obviously staffed with individuals who think it's ok to serve up this type of trash to their customers. What is going to happen is somebody is going to end up getting sick and this business is going to end up being sued for negligence. All in all, I drove 4 miles and paid over $6 for a bowl full of hot garbage that I would be ashamed to serve to my dog. The only reason why this Panda Express location is getting a one star review from me is is because there is no negative star option on Yelp. I think I will choose to spend my hard earned money at the Teriyaki Madness that just opened nearby. I would not set foot in Panda Express again if it were free."}
{"text":"I am laughing because the reviews on this thread is spot on. I've been to this location plenty of times and my experience was ok which why I gave it a decent 3 stars. HOWEVER, the reason I'm doing a chuckle while writing this review is I just sent my husband to pick us up some food and the chef that didn't know what he was doing was probably working tonight. Read the other reviews to see what I'm talking about. I ordered beef and broccoli which was good, chow main ... decent but somehow, they messed up the staple Panda Express entree which is the orange chicken. I don't know what I ate but it WAS NOT orange chicken that I was used to. Like I said, I'll give it a three stars coz of my previous experiences but it may or may not go up or down in the future. I don't know who the heck cooked the orange chicken but IT WAS NOT ORANGE CHICKEN! Someone needs more training. Management needs to get on top of that or someone from corporate needs to visit this location ASA"}
{"text":"I visit this Panda Express quite often being that it's very close to the house. For healthy eaters they have some pretty good options. My go to is always the chicken teriyaki but without the sauce. It's my favorite protein of choice but the chicken and mushroom is another favorite of mine. They also have the option for brown rice which is always nice because most places don't have that option. The lines are fairly long but it goes by quick. I've only dined in once and it was pretty clean."}
{"text":"I don't know what has changed with the Kung Poa Chicken, but what I got today was gross.  It was totally all dark meat with lots and lots of grisly tendons in it.    This location has nothing to do with my review.  It's clean and everyone is friendly.   The Kung Poa Chicken has changed and it's terrible.   Won't order it again."}
{"text":"Been here probably 30 times. Never had a problem. Tonight I said the walnut chicken looked dry. Complete ignore mode from the guy who was waiting on us. Pressed him and he just said \"we can't do nothing\".  At the register a flock of employees were congregating at a table eating. Super unprofessional.  Gal who was waiting on me actually said \"we like it when the manager is gone\". I replied, yep, it's obvious no one is here minding the minions.   Visit 8-2-2017 time 7:00 p.m.  Suggestion: always have a manger present!"}
{"text":"Went to Albertsons after work last night, and decided to stop and grab some dinner. Got the 3 entree combo. Honey Walnut Shrimp, Beijing Beef and Orange Chicken. Comes with your choice of fried rice or chow mein, which is not like any chow mein I have ever seen before. I always experienced it with saucy vege mix and dry crunchy noodles. This was closer to lo mein. Wasn't too bad though. Shrimp was good, beef and chicken were meh. For fast food Chinese at $10, not too bad. Would prefer a real Chinese restaurant, but those don't seem to exist here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here was the freshest I have ever had at Panda Express. It actually tasted really good compared to all the other ones I have been to.  Excellent customer service, and very clean as well.  I would go out of my way to eat at this particular panda again!"}
{"text":"While I don't really eat here, it is a favorite for my 11-year-old son when his mom is working and I don't have the wherewithal to pull something out of the freezer and stick in the microwave.  I have had the food here a few times and it is admittedly better than I expected!  What I would like to do is thank the two workers last night who helped me out when I showed up at about 7:00 PM to pick up my online order.  After a long day at work, commuting into Scottsdale and back and dealing with customers all day, I arrived at this location to pick up an online order.  Apparently, in my semi-delirious state, I chose the wrong location to pick this up from.  The workers were kind enough to see the disappointment in my face at my mistake and they quickly filled the simple order and got me on my way, no additional charge.  I realize that it was $5.42 worth of food that you gave up but believe me, it made my day.  Thank you very much and we will certainly be back, and I will make sure that I choose the right store next time!"}
{"text":"I am a T-Mobile customer and was offered free bowls and $3 off any $5 purchase via the T-Mobile Tuesday app. It stated it had to be booked online.  I tried off and on for over an hour booking via my phone, my husband's phone, my lap top, PC and Kindle. Apparently, the Panda Express website was conveniently down for hours during this promotion. I thought, surely they would honor this as it is not the customer's fault that their website was down. Tried calling several times and the phone just went to a generic voice mail. I went down to see what I could do. They said it HAD to be booked through the website and there was nothing they could do. Nothing. Couldn't override they system. Wouldn't allow me to pay and then come back when the manager (who was conveniently not there at the time) was there and give me a credit. Wouldn't take the order and the coupon numbers and put it in the system later. There apparently is NO work around. There were other T-Mobile customers there too who were not happy about this. Waited around several minutes for the manager's phone number to discuss this issue. Meanwhile, the food bins are almost empty. A gentleman had been waiting for his steamed vegetables for several minutes. It seems like a dinner rush is a foreign concept to these people Called the manager who never called me back. I took my business elsewhere where they are HAPPY to honor coupons with just the number. I have filed a complaint with T-Mobile as well. If the manager Kyle Brown ever bothers to call me back and offers some sort of reasonable remedy, I will change my review. But for now, steer clear of this Panda location."}
{"text":"Here we are waiting in line and only one person behind service no one fee this place suck won't come here ever After waiting in line and for 5 min help show up"}
{"text":"Poor service!!!!  Manager is a joke - Lacks customer service skills!!!! Food is OK if it is not cold by the time they get your order to you."}
{"text":"The only good thing I witnessed here was the fact that my food they brought out to me  (they were out on the line) was hot and the young girl who rung me out was very nice.  The bathroom almost made me hurl and the floors/furniture was dirty. If you visit this one, use the bathroom before you go and bring hand sanitizer!"}
{"text":"All Panda Expresses I've been to are pretty much the same. The difference between this one and other ones is the staff.   They have these 3 Filipiniana girls (didn't catch their names) that had the best customer service. Very friendly, welcoming and over all made my dinning experience great.  The restaurant was clean and very organized.   My top favorite things to order: -Tofu Eggplant  -Mushroom Chicken  -Chicken Breast & green beans  -Orange Chicken  -Walnut Shrimp  -Potstickers (don't forget the sauce)  **Check inn on Yelp when you get there and you get 1 free entree :)"}
{"text":"This location has the absolute best customer service! We are in there at least once a week and you get to know the staff and they are so personable and friendly! They greet you when you walk in and overall, a great group of staff members!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give 0 stars! When I ordered off the menu through the drive thru I tried to speak while the worker interrupted me several times while I was trying to give my order. It appeared to me this person was only trying to hurry me up! She had attitude! I believe her name started with a C from what I remember on the receipt... She asked me if I was done placing my order and I told her yes, she gave me the total but my boyfriend had not given his order yet. He said we aren't finished and then she had the nerve to say \"well she said she was done\" all snobby like! As we pulled up to the window we weren't greeted or acknowledged. No eye contact at all! Gave us our total, took our card, and gave us our food.  I gave 1 star because the food is great."}
{"text":"I don't think I have eaten at a Panda Express since high school. I don't think I need to go back unless I am in fact with someone in high school. Needing to grab something quick and get back to a hectic Monday at the office I was lured in by the drive thru... My food was edible, but very oily, lacking in any kind of distiguishable flavor and the meat was fatty.   On the up side my fortune cookie was tasty and entertaining. But, if you want quick \"Chinese\" in the area, be slightly less lazy, get out of your car and go in to the Tokyo Express down the street."}
{"text":"I hate giving a chain more than three stars. This one is always super-clean, super-fast and super-accurate. I can't believe how fast the line moves, during the weekday lunch rush. I always feel like I've spent a tad too much for such run-of-the-mill Chinese food, but since I'm pretty sure that the secret ingredient in the Beijing Beef is crack, I spend it anyway.   Yum."}
{"text":"Went in nice clean place the orange chicken wasn't hot I recommend coming here workers were happy"}
{"text":"did i really get the FTR here? it's been open forever! this really is a consistently good panda, as far as panda express goes. stay away from anything chicken that isn't made with breast meat. i like the string bean chicken and the beijing beef. g likes the beef with broccoli, but sometimes they're a little chintzy on the beef. the \"crab\" puffs definitely aren't made with crab, but they're delicious little cream cheese filled, calorie laden, fried balls of goodness. service is friendly all the time and the price is right for a quick grab and go lunch. for my low carb diet, a panda bowl with steamed veggies instead of rice or chow mein and string bean chicken is filling and tasty. you're not getting the highest quality food, but you know you're getting something decent. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food is hardly fresh. Brown rice was old today and dry. Not going back. Someone help this place."}
{"text":"This has been the worst experience I've ever had at and of the Panda Express. When we first walked in we were not greeted at all and there was two lady's behind the food staring at a lady who was looking at the menu trying to figure out what she would like to eat. The two lady workers made fun of her while trying to take our orders right in from of our faces. When we were done ordering and they asked us if we were eating in or taking it to go the lady then proceeded to throw our food on the counter like we were making her do more work since we were ordering in. She then through us our fortune cookies and say thank you and rolled her eyes as she was checking us out. I'm 100% positive I will never recommend or come to this Panda Express again and I hope these two lady's find a job where they do not have to engage with customers."}
{"text":"This evening was embarrassing for Panda Express--  Marcos, (a newer employee) welcomed my family and I to Panda Express.  He asked me what I wanted. As I told him my sides, this older man in all black rudly interrupts marcos and starts telling him how to serve my food in the Togo box, he spoke to Marco as if he couldn't understand English or as if he was doing something incredibly dumb (he wasn't doing anything wrong) I didn't think much of it,  but when my son and my partner ordered as well and he stood next to Marcos, watching his every move, and was  breathing down his neck I became annoyed,   1)  I was waiting for him to finish my order and keep the line moving.  2)  I thought it was embarrassing and condescending of him to do in front of a line of people...  This manager was not only rude to me (the customer) but to his employee right in front of everyone....  I can't imagine what kind of team leader he is behind closed doors.    I wouldn't want to be talked to in that manner or embarrassed in front of a line full of people.  It made me uncomfortable to watch his lack of professionalism. I am sure I'm not the first to complain about his arrogance and attitude but I figured I would share this experience because customer service is emportant. So is the way you treat your staff!   Marco good job and keeping it professional and not letting this man frustrate you!"}
{"text":"Great service. Thanks for making a raining day sunny CJ. I appreciate the positive comment."}
{"text":"I ordered one meal and 2 drinks ($13, no fortune cookie included) then a side of broccoli (no beef) and they charged $4.45 for a small side of broccoli. Rip off."}
{"text":"I really like Panda express. Some of their dishes have 450 to 500 calories per serving, but others have a much healthier alternative. Chicken with green beans, mushroom chicken, teriyaki chicken have 250 calories. Substitute your noodles or rice for steamed veggies or half of veggies and half another choice.  This particular place has quick service, the place is clean and the flavors are reliable. One of my favorite fast food places.  Jocelyn was the person helping us and she was bubbly, happy, talkative and was really great to deal with. A+ for her service!  Parking can be hard to find since it's on the boulevard and in a busy area, but most people are walking in this area."}
{"text":"I like Panda Express and believe they can be as healthy as you want your food to be. Some of their dishes have 500 to 700 calories per serving, but others have a much healthier alternative with 150 to 210 calories. I usually substitute all or half of my rice for steamed veggies. The veggies fill you up without the calories. It's up to you how healthy or not you want to be.  The service at this particular location was quick. We were greeted right away with a warm smile. I was out the door in about 5 minutes.   I can say that the tables and floor were clean here. Cup lids, straws, napkins and utensils were all stocked.  Panda Express is another 'fast food' organization I would like to see start moving away from GMOs and into Organic ingredients."}
{"text":"I was in here before lunch hour. The service was good, employees were friendly. The food is just as you'd expect from any Panda Express. There was one lady doing a real good job sweeping and cleaning the tables. My drawback was some of the shady people you can spot here at times. Even though everyone says watch what time you go, I walked right up and was served immediately."}
{"text":"I Order for take out a bowl and a 2 entre plate . Both were made wrong I ordered orange chicken on both and walnut shrimp and they came with grilled chicken I tried calling the restaurant for 2 days now to try and see if they could resolve the issue but they have failed to pick up the phone . I don't know if they are just ignoring calls so they don't have to talk to customers or the phones don't work . Very disappointed right now !"}
{"text":"I'm sooo pleased with this Panda Express. Seriously! It was speedy through the drive thru, order was accurate, and the food is super fresh and spot on. Thank you Irania! You were the best."}
{"text":"food is pretty good wait was a bit long and they looked a bit confused but they gave us a free drink to make up for it so it didnt bother me much atleast the food was fresh and tasted pretty good compared to other places"}
{"text":"So I hate to give bad reviews and I'm not saying the food is bad. I got stuck In the drive through for over 30 minutes. I thought 1 hr lunch still okay life is not perfect. When  I ordered I felt I was being rushed. I even brushed that off. When I get to the window I wait another 2 or 3 minutes window opens drink is handed my card was given receipt was given and no I'm sorry for the weight no anything for wasting my time and giving up my lunch to wait. So now I am back at work lunch in hand and i ask myself how can I now enjoy my only break? It could have just been cured by I am sorry sir for how long everyone had to sit and waste their lunch because we don't have it together."}
{"text":"While waiting to get our oil changed at Firestone we were starving, so we decided to walk across the street to get Panda Express.  When we walked in we were excited to see all of their options and since this was my first time dining in a Panda Express, I had no idea what to expect.  The quality was average fast food Chinese but it was great that the food was hot and ready. The price was decent, the quantity was large, and overall we enjoyed sitting outside while eating our lunch."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars.   After paying $28 for lunch and waiting 30 minutes for teriyaki sauce for teriyaki chicken-  and not getting an apology!  How did the food leave the kitchen without sauce????   Disorganized- lousy service- no apologies- lack of prepping food or should I say it....plan for an 11 o'clock lunch crowd???  Stay away I'm sure there are better establishments that will appreciate my business- as they don't."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, I went there over the weekend with someone with a food allergy.  In ordering food it was specifically asked if they have grilled chicken with nothing on it.  The woman whom clearly spoke broken English said yes, nothing on it.  I asked again, there is no sauce or seasoning on the grilled chicken and she confirmed it.  So, I ordered steamed veggies and the grilled chicken.  Upon sitting down the chicken smelled very strongly of sauce.  I brought the bowl up to ask yet again to someone different and was told there is nothing on it but the chicken is soaked in a sauce.  WHAT?!?!  What part of nothing on it I was told means nothing except sauce.  At that time we requested a refund since it couldnt be eaten.  We were told no....wtf, you lie to me about how your food is prepared and then refuse to refund my money."}
{"text":"One of the better panda locations IMO. There was only one person working the front, she was okay, but I came at a lucky time before it got really busy. Food was pretty good. It's was you would expect out of cheap and fast Chinese food. Chicken egg rolls were on point though!"}
{"text":"This location has finally hired someone who knows what the hell he is doing, don't know his name but the store was getting backed up & some trays were empty and he was cooking but stepped out from the kitchen to let us all know the trays would be filled momentarily and took orders & had us pay while we waited which was brief. Normally your people would get scared not make eye contact and just ignore customers until trays were full. This guy acknowledged everyone and was very professional. Don't lose this guy and hire more like him."}
{"text":"Great service good food. Very quick through the drive thru. Was on my lunch and got the pepper chicken they gave me orange chicken!"}
{"text":"Nope. Generic food served with that TGIF over the top phony cheer. Give me a break, that alone is enough to make me throw up. Save your taste buds for some flavor  and go around the corner to King Yuans where the food is good, fresh and cheaper."}
{"text":"Calgary's second PE is now open.  It's a pretty large location with a good amount of seating including a small patio. Parking is good now, but once Via Cibo and the other restaurants in this new little strip open up it may become an issue.  A meal will run you $10-15 including a drink depending how many items you want. If you've ever been to a mall food court and had Chinese, this is basically the same thing. The guy behind the counter grabs a plate and you tell him what you want from a dozen or so choices. The menu seems to be very corporate driven. They don't have local items like ginger beef. They have Beijing Beef, which is delicious, but not exactly the same.  The big thing here for me is that this is the closest fast-casual Chinese place to my house and I can get a meal for under $15 compared to having to spend $50-60 at a traditional Chinese place and have leftovers for days which is just too much for my wife and I to eat."}
{"text":"Lots of choices to choose from, it is hard to choose. Favorite go to choices are usually Orange Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. Store is kept in immaculate condition, so clean and orderly. Friday night is a super busy time with the line almost going out the door. Friendly customer service with a smile."}
{"text":"Always like the orange chicken. If ever there was a dish that was perfected, the orange chicken is it. Second favorite is Kung Pao chicken. From experience, never eat the Kung Pao chicken in a dark movie theatre. It is hard to see the little chilies and they are extremely spicy. The decor is up to date. The service is fast and friendly. Didn't like the way items are bagged for to go orders. The little box containers are top heavy and don't seal. Add in traveling in a car and you have sauces leaking all over in the bag."}
{"text":"I wish I knew how to quit you, Panda Express.   You're not healthy, nor exceptionally cheap, yet if even the slightest whiff of orange chicken hits my nose I am bound to do your bidding. It's a pretty pathetic circumstance.   One Panda is the same as any other, whether it's in the mall or dropped next to a Walgreen's in suburbia. So I can always count on my free will being infringed upon and decision-making skills limited regardless of a particular location.   I feel like I am like a 20 year smoker reviewing Parliament's. If you've never been, don't go. If you have gone, you already know what I mean."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express' food! This time, I ordered the egg rolls and they did not disappoint. They are crispy on the outside and loaded with cabbage and chicken on the inside. I was full after only 2! This Happy Valley location is pretty clean, and I like the outdoor seating...minus the little birdies that were swarming me for crumbs! haha"}
{"text":"At Panda Express my order was cheese rangoon,lomein,teriyaki chicken. First of all the chicken was burnt and was room temperature. Second the cheese Rangoon was burnt so we asked if they can make a new plate of cheese Rangoon then the cheese Rangoon after being cooked it was frozen then we had lomein the lomein was cold and not good. They said since they are slow, not a lot of customers,that's why it was cold. What a poor excuse!!!"}
{"text":"This Panda Express benefits from being shiny and new.  Most of the items have seemed fresh when I have eaten here, but occasionally the fried chicken pieces taste more like a fried piece of a fried piece of something.  It does seem like this franchise has made an effort to provide more vegetables and healthy options, so kudos to that.  One small trick here is that the fountain drink station is around the corner from the register and is not easily visible.  What you see are individual bottled beverages by the register and nothing else.  I noticed others being confused by this and plumping for a more expensive bottled beverage when they were not aware of the fountain station."}
{"text":"Chuck and Larry talked me into their Friday afternoon ritual of expressing a Panda. Er.. of Panda Express.  I was secretly amused by the message on my cup that becked me to believe that orange chicken was truly a Panda Express \"original.\"  I mean, I haven't exactly done hard research on the subject, but I'm pretty sure there is exactly nothing original about their particular brand of super americanized \"chinese\" fast food.  The overall blandness of the place matches well with their food. Even dishes you would think would be spicy and exciting somehow manage to be tame and underflavored.  That's ok though, sometimes blandness can have a certain charm to it.  At least you know what you're getting into.  And the portions are plentiful.  And by plentiful I mean holy crap, what kind of a pig am I that I was able to eat most of it?  It's true what they say though. In two hours, I'll be hungry again, and I when I am, it's a pretty sure bet that I won't be thinking of Panda Express."}
{"text":"This location is really clean and the staff is usually friendly. They are always happy to make fresh entrees when I ask. I love coming to this location. While waiting tonight the girl even offered us free small drinks. Yay!"}
{"text":"Yum!  A bit too much cabbage in the chow mein  The fried rice is delicious (I love the soy sauce)  We have eaten here several times and it has been good every time"}
{"text":"I just left this location a few minutes ago. I tried and liked their new steak entree. I requested a new batch and understood I'd have to wait for it. I stood there no less than 15 minutes before asking for a refund. The manager came and gave me a cash refund. She didn't apologize or offer any explanation. Needless to say I was very disappointed in their level of customer service."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to trash on this place here, but I'll admit, Orange Chicken and veggie spring rolls are my guilty fast-food pleasure.   Glad they're in Gilbert. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!! Everyone is so willing to help out and the food is delicious. Big fan of this location. Shoutout to the staff!"}
{"text":"OK so my boyfriend and I went through the drivethru. First problem: they were out of cream cheese rangoons. I could have brushed that off with no problem if that was the only problem. My bill was $11.10. I had $10.10 in cash and I told them to put $1 on my debit card. The lady screwed up and put $10.10 on my card and $1 in cash. They then told me they were going to give me a refund and try again. That didn't happen. I've worked in fast food and refunds are very easy to do. They gave me a dollar back and then tried to tell me that they gave me a ten. The manager came up and showed me two receipts trying to say that she refunded me. When a refund is processed, the receipt says \"refund\" and all the amounts have minus signs. All they did was charge me twice! They finally gave me the $10 and we brought the food home. Terriyaki chicken was good. Chow neon was good. The orange chicken was spicy. SPICY! Panda express orange chicken isn't supposed to be spicy! The crispy shrimp was completely inedible. I will NOT be returning to this restaurant EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I am ashamed and reminded of my gluttony each time I walk into Panda Express.  Mediocre Chinese food that I find myself strangely addicted to.   The parking lot is a shame, with trash everywhere. The restaurant interior is basically clean. The other patrons are normally snowbirds or of the camo-clad persuasion. The staff is hit or miss. Generally, no one seems happy to be there (why would they?).  The food is always hot, but the amounts prepared never seem to be planned to the hour of the day.  The food is horrible for you, but tastes so good.  Don't let brown or steamed rice fool you...check the calorie counts online. You will surely feel worse about yourself afterward."}
{"text":"This is not my first experience as a Panda Express customer. However this is my first time at this particular location.  Today I opted to use the online ordering system to order ahead and pick up on my way home from work. I sadly found out that this was a joke. This location has no organization and no communication.  The confirmation email advised me to go to the Express online order pickup area for my food. As it turns out, this is the same area as everyone else waiting to pay who has stood in line. I was ignored for a good amount of time before I was finally asked if I had been helped. The girl disappeared to find my order and did not return for 20 minutes. When a woman, who appeared that she was the manager, asked if I had been helped, I advised her that I was still waiting for an online order. No one had ever communicated with me that they were waiting on an item to be cooked to complete my order. I was simply ignored standing in the same spot for 25 minutes.  I only found out this fact because I overheard the girl advise her manager. And still I waited.   After that amount of time, I was hastily handed my bag of food.  The order was not verified with me, and I had to advise her that I had other items and a drink as well. I am walking out of there currently very unsatisfied with my experience.  I do realize that it was quite busy in the store. I am normally very patient and give a lot of credit to those in the food industry. But there is never any reason to ignore or treat a customer rudely.  On a side note, regarding the online ordering system, there was a woman next to me who had issues with online ordering and had been charged upwards of $300 for a simple order. Granted, I had no issue at all, but take heed when using the online system."}
{"text":"I went here last night at 8:45pm. It was surprisingly crowded still, so it was promising that the food would still be good since they looked like they were still cooking and they're open until 10:30pm on Saturdays. After waiting in line (2 people ahead of me), I heard the woman in front of me order 4 bowls--3 with white rice. I had also planned on getting white rice. The employee informed her that they didn't have any more white rice made, and they were not going to make any more for the night.   Now, this is a chinese restaurant--albeit fast food, but a restaurant where white rice is typically a staple regardless. Also, they weren't closing for another HOUR and FORTY-FIVE minutes. I left since they don't seem to care about keeping their food stocked regardless of people still coming in, and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"they have revamped the place.. they need a little more tables. empty spaces."}
{"text":"Great location @ Arielle is the sweetest worker ever! Love her!"}
{"text":"Whole Staff ROCKS!!! Entered & out within 10 mins...crazy fast & super good. Got frash orange chicken, so yum!!!"}
{"text":"Eh. It's Chinese fast food. Satisfied the late night craving. They were nice at drive thru."}
{"text":"Of course they would screw up my drive thru order! How hard is it to get it right when you order and it's on the screen then get home and it's wrong! Seriously?"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like being adventurous today so went main stream. Not the first tango with my little black & white freind. Lady at the counter was mad but maybe she was having a bad day. Beef and broccoli was more like broccoli and a lil beef. Not too shabby though, clean and fast."}
{"text":"Staff is terribly rude. The orange chicken had so many red pepper flakes in it that it was inedible... I took the large container back right away and the rude lady named Norma tasted a piece and said it was fine! I showed her all the red pepper flakes and she said it was normal! As if I've never had he orange chicken?! I know how it's suppose to be. My 7 year old's mouth was burning for heavens sake! She HOLLERED to another associate to come taste it and that associate agreed with me tray it was inedible. The Rude Norma lady refused to give me a refund because at that point I wanted nothing to do with their food. She was the rudest person I've ever met the way she spoke and yelled to other associate and customers... as much as I spent there since I'm manager of a corporation, I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! I get home to find they gave me broccoli beef instead of Beijing beef which wouldn't have been so bad if it had had BEEF in it. It was just a bunch of soggy, over-cooked broccoli. The noodles were disgusting. They were old.... And I mean OLD. TASTED LIKE THEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR A WEEK. The spring rolls were soggy too. Worst Panda Express EVER!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service . Food was fresh May the manager was very pleasant . Great place"}
{"text":"First time in this location and it wasn't packed. The workers here seemed to be \"over it\" when I came in. They didn't appear to have much patience but I've been there before so I wasn't going to be highly critical. Everyone is entitled to having a bad day, even if it's multiple employees at the same location.  Got the food home and notice that the fried rice had a burned taste to it. No bueno. I think it seeped into the chow mien too because it was fair but I could taste that burned flavor in it as well. I will give this location another try but the first visit was very mediocre."}
{"text":"Stopped at this location for the second time in like 6-8 months. The first visit I was actually shocked to see that they offered vegetarian selections now and even changed the way they prepared their rice so that it was vegetarian friendly. In the past, there wasn't much I could order here outside of the cream cheese wontons.  This visit, however had nothing vegetarian to offer but the wontons and vegetarian egg rolls. Typically they have tofu. I was only stopping in because mom had a craving but thought I might order something once I started smelling the goodness. Well, I didn't get anything because as I mentioned, the selection was small.  Both times I have come here, the restaurant has been a ghost town. Today there was absolutely no one inside but the employees, me and my mom. The same for the last visit, but grant it they were both Sundays.  All in all they keep the place clean in which I appreciate and demand, and my mom loves it, so all is good. Oh and the staff? Always super friendly. Kudos to the training staff!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a panda closer to home. I've been to this location @10 times now. I don't know if this reflects worse on me or them that I can say this is hands down the WORST panda in the chain. (Me for going back after always having a bad experience...) They are out of half of everything, whether it's due to being busy, or because it's slow and not time to replenish the pans. The staff is friendly and young but never seems to be an adult anywhere to keep things moving...any direction would be good!"}
{"text":"I've only been to PE twice in my life and both times have been inside the Inland Center Mall in  San Bernardino. The food was super sweet, portions were skimpy and prices were high. So I've never been a fan of the food but It was actually tasty today.  Portions are skimpy and prices are high for what you get but you do get full. Service was ok. I most likely will return in the future."}
{"text":"I have never had a good experience. I have gone here often because I love Chinese food but I seriously get sick every time I eat at this location AND they always get my order wrong. I said FRIED rice.. Not white."}
{"text":"Below is what I wrote to their Corporate Office Feedback/Complaint Form(400 String Characters max.(Do Your Best Reading)).  A Loyal Customer of Panda Express and that location in specific.

{"text":"Horrible is a huge under exaggeration of this sub-par fast food facility. Ordered food through the drive through tonight and arrived at 9, 30 minutes prior to closing. Was \"greeted\" by a rude and highly unprofessional employee whom even told us when we were ordering our drink, \"we have no ice, we're about to close. I guess we could go to Walmart to get your ice if you really want that drink\". 30 minutes of a wait later we received our food. Arrived home and to my dismay my order was horrendously mistaken. I ordered STEAMED VEGGIES. I didn't know steamed veggies looked like chopped up burnt chicken. The item they threw into my panda bowl looked like left over chicken that they were likely just going to throw away anyways since they were about to close. Worst part? The store is closed and I can't go back to fix my order. Stay away from this establishment. Horrible service and obviously the employees are not educated enough to even understand what vegetables are. *also already submitted a message to Panda Corporate which will not do anything, and realized that conveniently enough for the employee, they did not even bother to provide a receipt.*"}
{"text":"We went in today to order it being our first time. Was trying to see all the different selections. They impatient server instead of saying would you like to try something like she did for the customers behind us. She ask was we ready because if not she can help the people in line behind us. After we finally decided on what we wanted she to us to hold on so she can fix a worker who was behind the counter plate they requested. So we finally got our food. Drove home only for my fiancé to take two bites out of her fried rice and pull out a string. A no joke pice of string at least 4 inches long. I will never in my life give my money to this place ever again!!"}
{"text":"OK so I gave Panda another chance and they seemed to have got the message...no more rock hard S&S chicken. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Basic stuff. Would like the staff to speak better English so they can understand my order. Or (according to some dip$hits) i should learn Spanish and/or Chinese just to aid in my order."}
{"text":"horrible experience never ordering from this location again. wrong items missing items empty fortune cookie bag in my order. and of  course uber eats driver doesnt know what food delievery driving is all the sauces in the bag"}
{"text":"Worst Panda ever. I love Panda, but cannot stand this location and the kids that work there. Out of the 5 times I've gone there (because its close to my house), I have not had a single good experience. I will never go back, hopefully. Not only are they rude, the give horrible portions, cold food and their soda never has syrup in it. Had to pull out of the drive thru and walk inside every time to get soda that didn't taste like carbonated water. last trip, when I told the employee the soda did not have syrup in it, he was rude and blew me off. they have been rude every time I went there. I made the mistake of asking for lite to no veggies, they said they would try, but when I got home, I saw they actually gave me extra veggies and only 2 pieces of chicken. There is plenty more I can write. Save yourself, do not go to this location!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Looks good and friendly employees!! Like Isabel !! Very Kind and attended!!! But this place Panda Express!! Need better supervision!! Food not ready!! Very embarrassing to customers no people behind me waited No Vegetables ready !  No Teriyaki chicken until last minute !!  My vegetables cold !! Need to ask my $ back"}
{"text":"The smarty pants at the drive thru got our order wrong. He needs to slow down& lose the attitude."}
{"text":"The Chow Mein at this location was very fresh and tasy it didn't have that taste of sitting under a heating lamp all day."}
{"text":"Seems there have been some changes to their portion sizes and containers.  I was greatly disappointed to find 4 half slices of zucchini and 3 slices of mushrooms in my mushroom chicken.  In the past I always had something left over and with the new portion sizes I should have ordered 2.  No the prices have not gone down, just the product.  I will not be choosing Panda Express for dinner again."}
{"text":"Eveything in this restaurant is usually very clean from the tables, food area to the bathrooms. The food is always cooked well and always tastes great! The service is great as well especially during lunch time when most of us are in a rush."}
{"text":"Big portions and friendly staff (even when it was very busy). Great place!"}
{"text":"This is a clean, friendly, and fast location. The ladies helping take peoples orders were prompt and greeted you with a smile. I got fresh food right off the grill which was very nice and your always more than welcome to wait for fresh stuff if your picky. The food goes fast due to it being a busy location so your getting hot and fresh food each time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was very happy to find Panda Express in the airport and glad it offered me an affordable choice other than McDonalds or other fast food sandwiches.  I was very disappointed on my layovers in other airports when i was not able to find a Panda Express.  Definitely recommend it, anytime, anywhere."}
{"text":"I love Panda! Its always been a favorite of mine.  The service is always quick, easy and out the door. Kinda curious why there arent many asians working there anymore? I remember when I would go to panda and really  think it was a chinese or asian place."}
{"text":"The No. 1 reason I eat at Panda Express is the availability of fresh-cooked vegetables. I especially LOVE the fresh broccoli, my favorite vegetable. However, I do have a few criticisms of the vegetables at Panda Express. FIRST, the carrots are obviously frozen crinkle-cut and are completely unappetizing. I separate them out and do not eat them. SECOND, the sliced onions are almost always overcooked and slimy, so I separate them and do not eat them, either. On occasion, the String Bean Chicken has the same problem - brown, overcooked string beans. The cabbage is always great - it stands up to high heat stir frying! The sliced zucchini, however, is hit and miss. Sometimes they are bright, firm, and appetizing. Other times, they are mushy and broken down, so you guessed it -- I discard them, as well, when that happens. On balance, Panda Express is a great value and one of the few places one can find fresh cooked vegetables. I juust wish the other vegetables were as good as the broccoli & cabbage!"}
{"text":"Don't go threw the drive thru and there's so rude!!!  Just don't go there at all I prefer to not eat seriously!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and tasty. The beef was tender and chicken fried just right and the Kung pao chicken was superb."}
{"text":"Why do I keep coming back? This is the slowest Panda ever, even your online orders aren't ready when you arrive. Don't know what's express here?.."}
{"text":"Decent, standard Panda.  Quick service, good food, friendly staff.  I have been here a couple of times.  They are always making more food.  There is usually a line, but its lunch time!  Had a great Panda bowl of shrimp with chow mein the other day."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda Express I have ever been to and sadly it is the closest to my home. I have given this location multiple chances and they just can not get it together."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Maybe because it was close to closing, they were not stingy on portions.  Will be back.   Bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"This place is not the best location I ordered some Beijing meet with noodles and that was leftovers I guarantee it if it's Chinese only owned! They dont throw away notting brother, what i ate was leftovers!! Bet on it , beware of this!"}
{"text":"This enterprise has wasted money on an app that is pointless. You pick up your order to be either looked at blankly as if your order was forgotten or with having to wait for them to quickly put your order together. On a good day your meal is actually ready but then you come to find they forgot to put teriyaki sauce for your Teriyaki Chicken and as well as sweet and sour for the Rangoon's in the bag! I feel 2 stars is being generous."}
{"text":"we went through drive thru on 11-9-14 around 6:30 pm.  we ordered our usual entrees.  the service was a little slow but nothing to freak out over.  we get home and noticed that our 2 combo meals are messed up.  we just ate what they gave us.  my biggest complaint is the half and half of brown rice and chow main.  both were dried out and had no taste.  the food overall was horrible.  i will not be going to this location again."}
{"text":"Probably the worst most uncomfortable experience ever. I ordered my food, no big deal. I work in one of the local shops in Dana park and asked like I do everywhere if they offered a discount for employees of the plaza. The cashier told me that I had to have a name tag or a hat. I said we don't have hats or name tags but I friend to hand her a business card with my name + employer + address on it. She refused to even grab it and continued to tell me rudely that only if I have a name tag or hat. I said that's stupid policy but okay no biggie. I still paid for my food and was nice. She didn't even hand me my cup or wait for me to walk away before starting to talk about me in Spanish. IN FRONT OF ME TO ANOTHER EMPLOYEE. I began to feel so uncomfortable I didn't even have a cup for my drink. I looked over at her and her coworker. Ya coworker looked straight at me and gave me a dirty look as the other woman pointed to her name tag and so I said I can hear you talking about me. Instead of apologizing. The ran off to a corner by another computer so they could talk about me farther away. Never going back here. And I'm sure my co workers won't either."}
{"text":"I just went to this panda express today.  me and my boyfriend walked in. No one greeted us. This was 3 people standing at the register checking someone out. Really 3 people.  I saw 3 people in the back doing who knows what. 2 cooks. 2 workers walked by , not saying a word. After waiting 5 minutes we just left. absolutely horrible customer service. I won't ever be a customer to this location again !"}
{"text":"This location is horrible. Do not bother with the drive thru. Even if you are the only person in tue drive thru, you will still wait 10+minutes. But you can certainly expect a 20 min wait with an average drive thru line. Then what you get afterwards is sloppy and unkept food. The rice is in clumps and looks like a hot mess. After all the time in their drive thru, they gave me half my order. When i went to return the food because they wasted my time in line and they already stole my valuable time, there was not an apology for the lack of quality and cuatomer service."}
{"text":"If you complain about the food you're out of your mind. The service is usually slow though."}
{"text":"Busy place. Assembly line order process. A little confusing for first timers. We actually got (and realized later were charged) for more than we ordered because of fast paced and unclear order process. Food was pretty good. Place was very clean and orderly. Good for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Been to most the panda express's in town always get the same thing...mixed veggies teriyaki chicken. I guess I made the mistake of getting there right when they opened, mixed veggies were not done yet, so I waited.. Took a bite of broccoli and noticed a strange flavor.. Didn't think much about it then took a huge bite of mixed veggies that where all stuck  together with this waxy white substance. (that I didn't notice) .... Gross it coated my mouth and tasted horrible...showed it to the clerk she asked me if I wanted something else... Haha  not from here.. I'm currently feeling sort of sick.  Be careful this is not the norm for panda in Vegas. so gamble on this location if you want. Goodluck!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the new Angus steak dish, very fatty and chewy. Think I'll stick with the chicken that's almost always delicious."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place last night. Not only that but the chicken tasted soggy and stale, should of known not to eat it in the first place, that's how their food usually turns out unless you ask for a fresh batch. But now that I've actually gotten sick from the food, yuck!! NEVER EATING AT PANDA AGAIN"}
{"text":"Really upset they don't serve tofu. At all. Chinese is usually my go to easy to get vegetarian fare but nope. I walked in and walked out. He said it was a regional thing. But beware. No tofu served here."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on our drive back towards home from Las Vegas. It was very late in the evening so there wasn't that many people around.  The server behind the station was very nice, he offered a cup for water without us asking for it!  The place is kept tidy with the employers wiping the tables right after the customers left,  and we got a generous portion of not so bad chinese food.  Nothing to complain"}
{"text":"Greasy fast food Chinese located at the food court inside the Red Rock Casino.  We usually get an order with two sides and one main dish and that's enough food for at least two people!  chow mein noodles are a hit.  A quick bite right before the movie always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Trashy Panda Express location compared to the others off the strip.  But I came here one drunken night with other drunks to sober up and we saw some guy dressed like a wrestler with a WWE championship belt, which is cool.  You probably won't see this dude at other Panda Express stores.    I tried the new Orange Chicken with Bacon which was really good and the new Chicken Breast w/Kale.  They might as well calla it, Chicken Breast w/Broccoli and Kale because I had more broccoli than kale.  You can ask for less broccoli when they serve you but just take it off it altogether.  Orange chicken + bacon = YES!"}
{"text":"1st to review, baby!  Although this Panda Express I believe has been here for quite a long time.  It has been anyway since I moved into the neighborhood several years back.  This particular Panda Express is the one I usually hit up when I have that guilty craving of Americanized 'Chinese' food.  It hits a pretty good spot.  And how can you resist that cute A$$ panda bear??  Marketing at it's finest I tell you.  No longer do I think pandas and bamboo...I see a panda, I think ORANGE CHICKEN!  Sick, so sick.  I guarantee you kids now a days will grow up thinking that all pandas eat at Panda Express, and will be sadly let down when they find out pandas eat fiber.  All day long.  What's next?  Penguins that have happy feet?  Hmm...sounds oddly familiar.  This place is usually very clean, and most of the time the food is pretty fresh from the wok.  I usually try to hit this place right around lunchtime because almost everything is just coming out piping hot instead of sitting under warmers.  I know most of you have been here before so I won't bore you of how it works with the line or your ordering options.    My go-to Panda meal (always in a to-go box because I firmly believe you get just a tiny bit more food) - 1/2 fried rice, 1/2 chow mein, beef & broccoli or string beans with chicken, sweetfire chicken or sweet & sour pork, and always (ALWAYS) orange chicken in a separate container.  I like it in a separate container because I don't like it to mix with the rest of my food!  Plus, if they put it in the same container with your other choices I notice you get a little less.  Funny, I don't remember a time when I've been to a Panda Express and never got the orange chicken.  Lately I've been on a Kobari Beef kick with them, one of their new dishes.  Marinated beef with wok-seared peppers, mushrooms, and leeks, all tossed in a sweet, smoky, spicy sauce.  Not too shabby!  I would make this at home if I had a burner that could reach the BTUs Panda Express has.  It's so good!   Of course you always have the option of their other popular items like mandarin chicken, mushroom chicken, kung pao chicken, Beijing beef, Mongolian beef, as well as their shrimp dishes, crab rangoon (so easy to make it's ridiculous), potstickers, and soups.  For a 3 entree meal with a drink for under $10 it's a pretty good deal if you're in a hurry.  I stop here a lot when my lady and I can't decide where to eat for cheap.  I come to this particular Panda Express because literally 3 doors down (ha ha) is a Subway.  I love me some Subway $5 foot longs!  So my lady and I usually will end up sharing a 3 entree meal from Panda and a foot long from Subway.  When I say share, I mean I eat half the foot long ALONG with sharing the 3 entree meal.  Gotta get my veggies in somehow!  It's funny how a meatball marinara sub goes so well with greasy chow mein.  Match made in culinary heaven!"}
{"text":"This Panda Express in the heart of Summerlin, is probably one of the much better ones I've been to in a long time.  I don't get that fast food-y, get in, get out, next person in line feeling that I always get when I visit them in the mall.  This Panda Express is a lot more like a real restaurant.  The inside is very inviting, and surprisingly very clean.  The tables and chairs are new, and they actually have leatherette benches for folks to sit on.  The decor is light and open, in no way cheesy or kitschy with too many bright colors like other Panda Express restaurants.  Mind you, we got here right after they opened at 11 AM so the place was pretty empty and hadn't had its lunch rush yet.    Upon inspection of the food line, all on it was super fresh.  The rice and noodles were fresh, all cooked items were fresh and not sitting under the heat lamps for long.  Nothing was soggy, and nothing was dry looking.  Very good sign!  Glad we got there for the early bird rush because the food was actually looking tasty.  And for what it's worth for a Panda Express (home of Americanized 'Chinese' food) my 3-item combo was in great order.  Service was friendly with a smile, and I wasn't rushed at all.  With my 3-item combo I got the usual suspects:  -Half & Half of Chow Mein and Mixed Vegetables (gotta watch my girlish figure) -Mushroom Chicken (Wok Smart item - under 250 calories a serving!) -Broccoli Beef -Orange Chicken (always in a little take out box for me)  I also favor the Sweetfire Chicken Breast, Eggplant Tofu, and Beijing Beef.  Now, Panda Express even serves brown rice at no additional charge!  Great for an after gym meal.   Nope, not the most authentic Chinese meal but it was good!  Fresh veggies and meats are key!  The mushrooms weren't mushy, the broccoli still had crunch, the meats were hot, and even my Orange Chicken still had texture.  Definitely one of the best Panda Express meals I've had.  I still like how they include the fortune cookie with every meal.  A nice touch, but of course not very typical Chinese.  Yes, I am part Chinese.    This Panda Express is a bit hidden in the strip mall off of Hualapai and Charleston, but worth the find.  It's much better overall than the Panda Express up the street in the Red Rock Hotel & Casino food court.  Hidden gem for some Chinese-American take-out."}
{"text":"This is my usual lunch spot when I am out shopping with my family. It is very popular and the line is usually quite long. I don't know what was up, but it was very slow going. Given that the food is already prepared, doesn't make much sense. I ordered a two entree orange chicken (my fave) with white rice. I really wanted vegetables, but they were out and I didn't want to wait. I was going to get a soda with my order, but they were out of Diet Pepsi. She asked if I wanted to wait or get something else. Being that I only drink diet soda, it meant must go without. I got water instead. The portion size was fine, but the orange chicken was a bit off on this visit. It was kinda vinegary."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service by Employee Omar! Went in yesterday with my son and he literally went table to table asking how everything was! I've never seen this happen at a Panda Express and thought it was amazing! It took good customer service to Amazing! Thanks for making us feel welcomed Omar!!"}
{"text":"Will NEVER be going to this Panda Express again. When a something opens everything should already be prepped. They told my wife our food would take 20 minutes but I'm sorry but 20 minutes for fast food is just too long to sit there and wait. The customer service was horrible and after my wife denied wanting to try their new item on the menu, the lady got quiet and completely ignored her. We will be taking our business to the 75th and lower buckeye location !"}
{"text":"My coworker went through the drive thru today, 01/24/17, at 10:10 AM (receipt says the \"server\" was Eduardo B) and purchased a Panda Bowl for herself and a Panda Bowl for me. I ordered mine with chow mein and orange chicken, which came out to $6.59 after tax and I must say, I'm disappointed in the proportions... Either I've been very lucky every other time I have gone to Panda or they under-provided our meals. The food was good but the serving was smaller than usual..."}
{"text":"When you go to Panda you know what you are getting.  It may not be gourmet or \"authentic\" but it is good, relatively cheap & always filling. Perfect for lunch on a workday!   This location was very clean & welcoming.  Ordered the Kobari Beef and the Sweetfire Chicken Breast.  The beef was tasty-maybe a tad too salty.  The sweetfire is always yummy!  I only get the chow mein as I'm not a fan of fried rice in general. They also had a new iced tea-It was a special tropical blend for PE.  Very good!  I refilled & enjoyed the rest at work."}
{"text":"I'm not sure you can even call this a Panda Express. I am consistently disappointed in this establishment. My experience just now was almost comical. They were out of white rice, out of fried rice, out of mixed veggies, out of orange chicken. So I got Teriyaki chicken, but they were out of teriyaki sauce, so I asked for soy sauce to put on the chicken and they were out of that too.  Whoever is in charge here should be fired. You're out of all these things at 4 PM on a Sunday where there is no lunch or dinner rush, unacceptable."}
{"text":"Be very careful with this location they keep their food bins mostly empty, then cook everything super fast, vegetables are always raw, as one worker told me they cook them for only 10secs, that's not fresh that's raw, this is including many vegetables that you're warned not to consume raw. There's a Panda Express not far from this location off of Charleston. Not sure if it's the same owner but the chefs always cook their food and give a great veggie to meat ratio."}
{"text":"ALWAYS always a line at this panda. When you finally get served the servers barely give you any meat with your entrees. Last time I visited their beef and broccoli was almost all broccoli and very little or no beef."}
{"text":"Located in the same strip mall as Marshall's, this place is not bad.  If you are lucky to arrive when the food has been freshly cooked and not sitting for a while.   Its an option for quick meal.  1 entree + 2 sides is about $6.99 $1 extra if you want shrimp though :O|"}
{"text":"They always have fresh orange chicken and everyone is super nice. I like their outside seating area."}
{"text":"Panda Express is a great, fast food Chinese dining place. Ambience is very casual. It's no wonder there are so many panda expresses all over this country. My personal favorites are orange chicken, the chow mein, the walnut shrimp, and the fried chicken. They have bowls, 2 entree plates, and different sized containers you can purchase, all very reasonably priced. I usually try to stay away from mentioning a lot about customer service bc I get that ppl have good days and bad days, but the manager at this location was awesome! Had to wait a few minutes for some chicken teriyaki I wanted, she offered me a drink because I had to wait which I thought was very thoughtful."}
{"text":"HOW DOES PANDA EXPRESS \"not have steamed rice\" didnt even give me a waiting time when it would be ready? They just do not have any? Disappointed. Thankfully there are more than one in this area! Ordered the new wok fired steak and shrimp which had zero shrimp in it."}
{"text":"The food is really good and I love eating there the only thing that they could improve on is the customer service. They should put a smile on there face when they help you."}
{"text":"I love this location panda ! Busy but always good service!!  Always they offer samples:)"}
{"text":"This particular Panda Express has always been great. Nice clean tables and the pack on the entrees. Staff members are very polite and ask if you want to sample anything."}
{"text":"The worst panda express for food. The food just taken home was greasy and no flavor. Very little selection here. Horrible food for taste and done"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful but the staff is a disappointment!! They forgot to give me my mandarin sauce on the side and I called and they just hung up on me."}
{"text":"My staple \"Orange Chicken\" did not disappoint.  The Beijing beef is absolutely delicious.  I know this location is new, so I'm not being too harsh.  I do agree that the noodles and fried rice need work.  I've been to a few Panda's in my years and I've never had noodles be so dry nor rice so bland.  I'm sure that I would go back once the initial hype dies down.  Pretty tasty otherwise and not bad prices!"}
{"text":"We visited here while we were waiting for prescriptions to be filled at Walgreens for an early dinner. The store was being cleaned while we were there and was in great condition. The drink area was stocked and cleaned and also being serviced during our visit.   We ordered a three item combo with orange chicken and beef and broccoli along with a child's meal with beef and broccoli too. We were rung up and the second cashier was very attentive to us and talked with us, but our cashier was short and ton the point. She did not give the receipt to me and as their coupon offered for Chinese New Year was put in the bag it fell out. I asked her for it as she went to help the next guest and wandered away like Im done with you go away. Or maybe because only spent 13 and some change at the register. They did not even ask me to donate the change. The inconsistent with this Panda are obvious but the second cashier nice smile and service made it better for 5 star. Plus the orange chicken was even fresh."}
{"text":"Decided to pop in here for a little snack before dinner since had a really light breakfast. This location is new for me but was incredibly impressed with the super customer service and attitudes of the employees. They had a huge party when we arrived and the employees behind the counter handled it flawlessly. They are very upbeat and vibrant which is refreshing in this months day.  I went with kids meals for the children and a small side order of beef and broccoli for me. The side that I ordered for the kids meal was orange chicken which looked good in the bowl they served it out of and on the fork too. It was very good and fresh as well. The beef and broccoli was fresh and beautifully cooked. The broccoli was just right and steamed to perfection. I am going to make this my new panda local since it is so close to me."}
{"text":"I pulled up to the drive thru at exactly 2:03 PM, I know this because as I drove up my phone rang. I was 4 cars back, the wait was ridiculous but I have been to this panda before and its always painfully slow at the drive thru. By the time I pulled up to get my meal, my phone call was 17:20 long. I told the server, you know I have been waiting for 17 minutes? She immediately cut me off and said you have been here for 5 minutes sir! I said impossible my phone call says 17 min. She responded I have the timer right here its been 5 minutes! With a stern and annoyed voice as if I was the one keeping her in line for so long. I asked from the time I got in line or from the time I ordered my food? She specifically said from the time you got in line........She closed the window to get my order. The person on my phone call couldn't believe she talked to me like this and was essentially calling me a liar. I didn't feel like arguing as I was on the phone and my lunch is only 30 minutes which 17 minutes of it was spent waiting in line. I am disgusted that an employee who is in customer service would respond the way she did. Is this location going to tell me that they monitor each car from the moment they get in line and start timing? I am calling BS on that, but even if they did I would challenge the manager of this panda express to go thru his security footage and see what time I showed up and how long I was in line. I have nothing to gain by lying. I do not expect anything free or discounted. I was just simply letting the server know how long I been in her line to get my meal. I have never been treated like this before. I would love for the manager of this location to check his footage and see how long I was in this line then I would almost demand that person be addressed for insinuating I was lying or exaggerating about it. I am a 37 year old disabled Army Vet and I refuse to let my integrity be questioned by this......person."}
{"text":"So I went to the drive thru on Friday and ordered a small fried rice for my dogs. I got it, no problem. I go through today and all of a sudden they don't have small anymore. I told them I just got one on Friday. They said it was a mistake. So instead I ordered a kids meal so I could get the rice for my dog who just had her teeth cleaned. They repeated the order back to me, then I get home to a tray of Chow mein. Thanks, Jennifer in drive thru!  So now I have to go back to get the rice. I will not be back at this location."}
{"text":"How many people does it take to serve some (and I use the term loosely) \"Chinese\" food?? Apparently quite a few! Especially when the supervisor takes personal call while serving guests! The original server was SO put out when we asked for steamed white rice and God forbid she had to go about 30 feet away to the food prep area and retrieve it herself! I'm SO sorry I ordered food requiring a small amount of effort to serve! The plate was then passed down the line and the personal call sup boxed up the incorrect meat, when I corrected him he snapped \"what is something wrong?\" It took EVERYTHING to bite my tongue...my reply was \"No, not at all\" inside it was much more R rated, but there were small children around....I refrained. Over all the good was nothing magical and the teriyaki chicken was bland and flavorless....also was never offered any sauce to solve that problem...not impressed, but I don't expect much from Panda."}
{"text":"Funny I'm making a review on a chain such as this, but laughing to myself after seeing reviews before me, this place is the only panda I've ever been too where nothing is ready at almost noon! I've never seen workers move so slow in my life."}
{"text":"This is the Panda I frequent most because it's so close to home. The staff is always really friendly. It's usually pretty busy so the food here is always fresh. Chow mein is never dry and the veggies are never soggy. It's the 3 item combo for me every time. I tend to get the Wok Smart items. The Mushroom Chicken, String Bean Chicken and Black Pepper Chicken are all great. I like that there are a decent amount of veggies in each and all under 270 calories! Sometimes I'll get the Eggplant with Tofu which has an amazing sauce and the eggplant is always so tender. Will definitely continue to visit."}
{"text":"I have been going to this drive thru Since it opened. Last night 8/8/2016 was my LAST TIME EVER!! The quality of the good had been degrading slowly. The food last night was almost inedible. The noodles were dry and chopped up so small that you almost didn't know they were noodles, tasteless! The  Orange honey walnut chicken was pasty with no resemblance to an orange taste at all! I also ordered a chicken egg roll, which was dry and overdone, almost a burnt taste! I was so hungry when I got home I ate it because I have low blood sugar so couldn't return it because I had to eat then to maintain my blood sugar level , but NEVER AGAIN will I eat at a Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through to order. Didn't even complete my order because they were out of chow mein which is what I really wanted. I shouldn't be that disappointed. It is fast Chinese food. So my standards should be low."}
{"text":"I like that they greet you as soon as you walk through the door. Awesome customer service and the food quality is great.  The service is timely and efficient. I love their honey walnut shrimp!!! We love Panda Express!!!"}
{"text":"The drive-thru waitresses Cindy E. and Rosa have very good customer service. They are very good at taking your order and getting it right the first time, all the time. The food is always hot with no errors. This Panda Express is one of the better I've experienced. I'd recommend anyone passing through and wanting a good experience to visit this Panda Express location."}
{"text":"I go to Panda for the same reason I drink Cheap Chardonnay, and eat chain pizza, or get a steak at Applebee's, It gets the job done. When I have great Rombauer Chardonnay, a authentic pizza from Mozza or an amazing meal at Mesa Grill, or the best hot and sour soup in the world at MY China, it's just that much better. I have had Martin Yan and Bobby Flay cook me dinner, yet in general I have a pretty good impression of Panda Express. They get the job done. Most Panda's that I have been too are pretty tasty fresh and generous. I can always count on that at the very least.  \"Pandas standard\" is usually good enough, but not here. I have tried several times and I am ALWAYS DISAPOINTED  and shake my head as to why this location is always so bad!!!  Today my meal was cool, a little past it's prime and super small portions. too add insult to failure there was no Hot Mustard... AGAIN.   I like the orange chicken dipped in hot mustard, It's so cravable, but without hot mustard is just not as good. The last 2 times here they were out and I almost asked first, but I had faith that surely they couldn't be out again!   This location is PANDAS BLACK EYE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. They are very stingy with the serving size. They also forgot my other but try charged me. I came back the next day and complaint about the servicing g size and the girl said that was they told. I was like are you f--king kidding me?."}
{"text":"We were just there but we go all the time. The girl who helped me was so sweet. They promptly made the items we needed and were friendly and helpful. I love the new Wok Seared Steak and Shrimp!"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant for quick Chinese. Today the kids were rather disappointed because the orange chicken was cold and didn't have much sauce. We come here often and this was a rather lackluster visit. I hope it will be better next time."}
{"text":"There is a girl who works here and when others were rude , this o e worker HARLEY  was so nice!!! She  upset that I was treated so Rudly and she was just the nicest girl!! And what a cool name too!!!"}
{"text":"This place has ISSUES!! There's a reason it has only 3 stars avg.   Ordered at drive-thru and was told it'd be about a 3 min wait for chow mien. I figured, ok sure. So I waited around the drive-thru... and waited... and waited. Finally, after 12 minutes I go inside and ask to speak to the manager who apparently wasn't available because he's was too busy with a wok tossing around the next batch of god-knows-what.   I finally get my order handed to me 17 minutes later!!! 17 MOTHER-EFFING blood-boiling minutes later. Never again with this place! Not the first time having a bad experience here, but it was the last."}
{"text":"I know Panda Express is viewed by many as 'fake' Chinese food... and that's fine by me. I like the 'fake' Orange Chicken from Panda Express better then the real stuff I have had elsewhere, so from time to time we will get lunch from Panda Express.   The employees are always friendly when I am there, but I must say, it's kinda weird to have people serving you 'Chinese' food while they speak to each other in Spanish..."}
{"text":"Terrible I ordered a bowl with lo Mein and walnut shrimp.  When I got home and took one bit I found a long hair all mixed in with my Lo Mein.   It grossed me out so much I vomited all over.   Part of the hair was down my throats and hanging out .   I threw the whole thing out immediately.  I will never eat at Panda Express again!   And I'll be telling all my friends and family not to go either. A few days later. Now someone from Panda is asking me to DM him my phone number.   What is DM?  Because the yelp app doesn't let me send this person a message"}
{"text":"Dear Panda Management,  Please have your employees check the correct order before giving it to the customer.  Several orders got mixed up and we ended up receiving the food of the guy behind us. How hard is it to follow the line? And why does beef and broccoli only come with three pieces of beef?  Thanks for reminding me never to eat Panda again."}
{"text":"So .... why do you exist?  Over time your quality of service has continued to decline. Tonight we ordered a 3 entrée meal. What we got was was not enough to feed 2, much less 3.  While there, we queried the order and were effectively belittled.  We have choices, ours will no longer include your establishment and would encourage others to take these comments into consideration."}
{"text":"I don't go to this location often but I went tonight 20 minutes before they closed and when I was ordering she said \"I just want to let you know we only have limited food\". I asked her if they could make more of the chicken I like and she didn't want to at first then was rude and said \"okay you need to wait 5 minutes\". I pulled up to pay and they handed me my food right away so either they didn't want to give that specific dish away to take home or they cooked the meat in less then 5 minutes. Either way the cashier was very rude. Never going there again."}
{"text":"The food is always good and Emily gave great service. As someone who works in the service industry, I appreciate her upbeat attitude and genuine willingness to help."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely awful .... I have been here 3 times because I thought I would give it another try hoping something redeeming would happen... Nope... Just called them to ask how late they were open and the girl said 9:30 it was 9:31 I looked on the website and it said they close at 10:00 pm so I called back but they took the phone off the hook till 10 .... Shady business!"}
{"text":"This place is still a mess! My friend commented that she just went there to pick up dinner last friday. Food mess on at least 12 tables. She mentioned to manager who literally said..\"oh ok\". No apology etc."}
{"text":"Food is like all the pandas, just the service is not good, no bueno, they need to put more attention"}
{"text":"Grecia was great.  Super friendly.   I always come here after the pool at Mandalay.  Have been for years.  You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"had to wait 30 mins in the drive thru for 2 cars in front of us and got horrible service from the cashier who couldn't understand anything.On top of it all we  Got food poisoning from this palace Never coming again."}
{"text":"Well...  the only thing I can say is.... if you like your food to have one consistent flavor ...no matter what choice you make.. being  the flavor of the grill... then this place is for you. It all tastes the same to me... the same strange grill flavor.  I know it's fast food... but... I will not being going back as there are plenty of other options out there.   1 star IMO.  Hatch"}
{"text":"The chow mein and fried rice  has no taste whatsoever.. The chicken teriyaki is good but the orange chicken taste weird. Too bitter! So unhappy especially since was my last and second meal of the day."}
{"text":"When it comes to a mall food court, you can't do much better than Panda Express. The food is fresh wok'ed and hot but watch your wallet because you will be paying through the nose to eat here. Yes, this location has super high food court / tourists prices. My 3 item plate and small soda came to $14.00! Fourteen dollars! I nearly fainted. The food is standard and the employees didn't want to give me a free sample of one of their new dishes -- they looked at me like I was from outer space when I asked for a sample.   This is one of the only places in the Fashion Show Mall food court that offers free refills that you get to refill yourself. Buy the small soda and refill it all you want. They have Pepsi products. I tried to drink 8 cups of Diet Pepsi to get my money's worth. At least the food was good."}
{"text":"Love this location because the employees know how to fill the plate and make sure you get what you pay for -- no skimpy portions here! The food is typical Panda fare but it's usually pretty fresh as they cook all day long. The employees are friendly and there's a drive-thru which is super nice. And the bathrooms and dining room are clean. No complaints."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would we don't normally come here but the last 2 times were horrible the first time they burned my kids grilled chicken so bad it was hard and her noodles were all veggie I complained and got a response of next time go in and show them your problem I had taken pictures so I sent it to them and told them that when we got home which is not close is when we saw how horribly burned the chicken was we decided to give them another chance since they sent us a little card with a complimentary item .....today again messed up our order and when I tried to call the store 4 times no answer I will not come here again and I do not recommend you go either"}
{"text":"I feel like every time I come to this panda the food is hard, dry and very over cooked. They never have fresh food out and they are never willing to make more food, so if the food that's left isn't enough for your meal that's still all you get. The bad part is I love panda but I tried the panda at Chandler mall & it was amazing the meat pretty much melts in your mouth it's way better by far. If you don't mind the drive go to a different one."}
{"text":"Orange chicken MOSTLY breading - no beef in beef & broccoli ... PLEASE may I know - Where is the GOOD Chinese food?"}
{"text":"\"chloe\" waited on me, & was very rude. She acted as if she didnt want to be there and didnt have a great attitude toward me AT ALL ... it was my first time being at this location, and i will not be returning.  ALSO, all the food tasted quite different from other pandas. It was odd... i got orange chicken, tasted like sh*t, and i ordered angus steak. Tasted NOTHING like the angus steak, and didnt even look like it. Tell me what u think ..."}
{"text":"I go here nearly weakly to eat. Amazing food. Only complaints I have is that the orange chicken doesnt have much of a kick to it like the orange chicken at other panda express's. Also if you go in half an hour before closing they wont bother to keep making food. They say whatevers there is what you can get. Period."}
{"text":"I came in right before closing and they gave me a TON of extra orange chicken on my plate.  very tasty"}
{"text":"I usually don't complain about Panda Express for yet the food is great and somewhat cheap. However this visit was disappointing. When my boyfriend and I walked in right from the start there was not enough food out and what was there was old and you can tell it must have been sitting  out there for some time. When we got our order the Orange chicken tasted dried out. Overall the food was old. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the slowest place I've ever eaten at. Most of the time the staff is not friendly. About 50% of the time my order is wrong. I try to give them a chance to get better but when i do it's something else. The drive through staff are not friendly and seem upset all the time or don't care. When i ask for something extra I'm more afraid."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, friendly staff, and reasonably priced! Love the Angus Steak and the Kung Pao chicken! Bring back the \"Peppercorn Shrimp!!\" Would get 5 stars except there is no drive- up window."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go to if you do not want to spend a lot of money on food. They give big portions of food. Shrimp and steak have extra cost but overall food and price wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"just got home from picking up dinner and my boyfriend took a bite into his orange chicken and there was a sharp broke piece of plastic in his chicken (as pictured) tried calling but they didn't answer and I am back home on the other side of town and they are closing. this is terribly disgusting and an extreme safety hazard!"}
{"text":"I like Panda Express, but this location is consistently below par compared to other locations.  I've had poorly cooked food, dirty tables, slow service.  Last night the food was OK, but had to wait for veggies (even though it was not busy).  When leaving, all the trash containers were overflowing... it just does not seem well run."}
{"text":"Arron and Vera were absolutely amazing and customer service was on point in all aspects. The food was fresh, by far Shanghai Beef was splendid. Environment was clean and  customer flow moved quickly and efficiently. We will return again."}
{"text":"Jesus, I've sunk a new low.  I'm eating at Panda Express because when I ate at Wasabi Jane's the year before in the Venetian Food Court, I got sick from the grease.  I figured Panda Express could do a better job.  My god, they did!  I ordered the Mandarin Chicken Lo Mein which was basically some chicken, bean sprouts and thick flat rice noodles (kind shaped like udon but longer and squared off).  They actually had to cook this so it took forever...definitely not fast food.  But at least it was fresh and not overly oily.  I also enjoyed the icy iced water they gave me.    I watched the workers check the temperature of the food, change out the soup and basically clean every 2 seconds in between each customer.  I would have to say this was a fairly pleasant experience.  I still can't believe it."}
{"text":"Very slow, food under cooked . Billed for wrong amount. Added a donation when told not to. Asked for bowl got plate. Sebilee lied about the bill and was nasty when asked to correct."}
{"text":"I visited panda express last month service was slow and worker didnt cut teriyaki chicken right my wife like it the quality is poor going to search for a better location that takes pride in serving the neighborhood correctly"}
{"text":"I was so starving tonight and lazy to go get something further away from home so decided to drive through to get a plate togo. I ordered chow mien noodles with kung pao chicken and honey walnut shrimp and was so happy drove back home but things turned the other way around when I opened my food and saw kung pao chicken WITHOUT CHICKEN!! yes! there was barely no chicken on my plate only couple small pieces of ground chicken with lots of zucchini. Very disappointed and waste of my money. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Asked for white rice 3 times and they still gave me brown rice. Oh yeah there was a piece of a napkin inside my tray."}
{"text":"Tried to order a large side, half orange chicken and half blk pepper chicken... attendant said, they cant do that. I asked if the 2 were different prices, she no... so what's the issue then? Made no sense to me. Tried to use logic and reason with attendant but it was lost on her..."}
{"text":"The main function of this review is to certify that a real Yelper has been here and has received reasonable service and food that was about the standard of any other Panda Express. No rudeness or food poisoning was involved in the production of this review.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good Americanized Chinese food.  I love the orange chicken and it's always very consistent.  The only problem is the location of this Panda Express.  There is a large amount of homeless and day workers here so just keep your eye out.  Other than that my daughter loves it here and it's her favorite..."}
{"text":"This panda is trash, every time I go to this one the food is nasty, and always seems like there never is any thing fresh! Stuffs always empty! Today they had no teriyaki sauce! It was 8:45 y'all close at 10 but couldn't make anymore... get new cooks and fire your lazy employees end of story"}
{"text":"This is the worst PE I have ever frequented. I keep trying again and again because they are the closest to me but once again they screwed up my order. This is my last time at this one. I will drive the extra 5 miles to get to others. Not 1 single time have they given me what I ask. Their ineptness or carelessness knows no bounds. Save urself the frustration and DRIVE ON BY!"}
{"text":"This location is tucked away in the corner near Costco. There is no drive thru here. The food can be hit or miss. They will make fresh food for you, but be prepared to wait 5-10 mins for it to get done. Peeking pork is excellent!  It's Panda, not gourmet food."}
{"text":"Typical Panda Express. It's hit or miss with the freshness. The fried rice is usually crunchy from sitting there too long. They're fast in the drive thru. It's good for a fast cheapish meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the experience!!   Buyer beware here !!   I ordered a 2 item meal with (double orange chicken) ,  I then added a (chicken egg roll ) to my order while in line ,  I paid sat down and opened up the styrofoam container and there was 1 portion of orange chicken , the egg roll and rice ,, I then took the container back up and asked where the rest of the orange chicken was ?  The employee told me that was a 2 item plate and then went on to inform me that was just how it was ....    I then asked her to point out on the menu board above where egg rolls are an entree,  she replied \" it's on the more choices area \".  She at no time offered anything to fix this order !  Terrible customer service ,  I plan on taking this horribly executed procedure to the Chairman and his wife for an explanation..   I have dined at Panda Express since they opened their doors and I have NEVER had a negative experience until 3-26-2017 at the 7369 W. Bell Road 85382..  and ,, honestly it was not the taste or flavor that I was used to either..   They need to get this location fixed ...."}
{"text":"Slow service!!!!! Every time I go to this location it's slow! Most times the portions are skimpy! I have noticed that a few of the hispanic workers seem to give larger portions if the customer is also Hispanic. This is an observation after dozens of visits here my son loves Panda. The food is good however service stinks!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience here.  The nicest thing happened to me here that has ever happened to me at a quick-casual/fast-food establishment.  I came in right before closing on a Saturday night.  I wanted some Orange Chicken, which they had, but they didn't have that much left.  I didn't mind, though, so I ordered a bowl with the Orange Chicken, got the food and sat down.  Part way through eating, the clerk who had helped me with the food approached me with a small plate of freshly made Orange Chicken.  She mentioned that, because I didn't get that much, they made me a fresh batch.  I hadn't asked for more, but they went out of their way to make some for me of their own accord.  It was delicious.  Moreover, it was very courteous, and I felt very thankful for her and the staff's generosity.    10/10 would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"The place is OK but other places do two pieces of teriyaki chicken, this one one and a half! Really"}
{"text":"The worst food I have ever had from panda. Had to replace my orange chicken with the teriyaki chicken and then gagged on that.. Would never eat here again."}
{"text":"So far i've had a good experience with the food. The only real problem here is either manning or the drive thru. It tends to get backed up anytime someone comes through the drive thru and people patiently waiting in line (who may have even been there first) are left waiting on the back burner. Not to mention some people even order meals online. It just seems like a lot to process for one shop. They could either use a better system to prioritize or hire more servers."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible, ate here tonight at about 7 and by midnight I was vomitting disgusting undigested panda, I would likely attribute it to the poor cleanliness of the restaurant, I will NEVER EVER be returning"}
{"text":"This place would run smoother if they didn't hire the 3 stooges. Me and my girl had to repeat our order 3 times while they bopped heads and knocked things over. They didn't even think to give us teriyaki sauce for my TERIYAKI chicken. They'll be a better panda down the street. This place will make your head and stomach hurt."}
{"text":"Honey walnut shrimp and orange chicken are delicious. Chow mein is nothing to write home about, pretty dry and bland. The crab Rangoon is also really bad. But overall I will go back for the shrimp and chicken."}
{"text":"I love this fastfood restaurant, cos the peoples are nice and pretty fast, and of course Panda always delicious :)"}
{"text":"It's Panda Express. There is nothing special about this one expect it's the closest one near the palazzio hotel. There is also a chipotle right next to this panda.   The food they serve is like any other dishes you would find at any other panda. Nothing too special.   Their one entree and one side bowl is less than 8 bucks. They also label the amount of calories each dish has. The calorie count can be found on the menu under each dish. (It's in a small white font, so it may be hard to find at first sight.) The calorie count was helpful cause once I saw the calories for the fried rice, I went with the veggie sides, which by the way is less than 90 calories per a serving. I'm in Vegas I need my bikini body!!! (No bloating please!!) Not that the orange chicken helped...   The lady at the from counter was so cheap! My friend asked for some extra fortune cookies and the lady denied my friend. How cheap is that?!"}
{"text":"A decent location, providing the same usual Panda Express options that we have come to adore and expect. Be warned of long wait times; I ordered a teriyaki chicken and veggie bowl which took about 35 minutes. This was the 2nd time that this has occurred to me at this specific location; in which a simple order took much longer than expected. I'm not sure if this is due in part to the employees or managment, but regardless I have been to better locations. It seems that they purposely favor certain customers over others, and I have seen the management treat the employees unfairly. As I was standing in front of the hotbar (foodline, if you will) I overheard the shift leader verbally mocking an employee. Now keep in mind this was all in the sake of \"fun\", yet I still strongly feel this this type of behavioral conduct is highly inappropriate and extremely unprofessional.   Pro tip:  Check out the Kika Sushi across the street at Whole Foods Market! Delicious, local business, with higher quality ingredients for just a few dollars more."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Panda Express. Can I say I've experienced better, sure, but this place is not bad or horrible as others make it out to be.  Stopped in for a late lunch on Wednesday and it was not very busy. I was greeted right away upon entering. I reviewed the menu and decided on the 'plate' which is 1 side and two entrees.  I chose the fried rice, beef broccoli and chicken& string beans. I was not a fan of the fried rice, but my two entrees were very good. The meat and veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly in my opinion. They have several sizes to chose from, and many entree options to chose from. Some entree items are considered 'premium' items and there is a 1.25 charge for those items. This location was clean, the service was friendly and when I want a quick Chinese fix I will stop again."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is newly built and recently opened. The outside looks great, very modern and well designed, it really sticks out and gives the place an inviting feel. Inside it's very clean and well laid out with bright lights and warm colors. Although very busy the couple of times I have visited so far, my order has been taken promptly and served up in no time with friendly service. I'm not going to be coy about feeling weird giving a Panda Express four stars, but along with the above mentioned things this location is doing right goes the food. I've been to malls plenty of times and gotten Panda Express for this reason or that, and the food here can't be compared. It all seemed fresh, hot, and well flavored. While I'm skeptical about the quality maintaining it's present state, I still have to be fair to what I've observed so far. Four stars... for now at least."}
{"text":"The manager John was friendly and welcoming when we came in. All the entrées were available and fresh. My favorite is the Kung-Pow chicken and it was good as usual. This is the cleanest nicest panda express I've been in. Used the restroom which was also clean. The very friendly man behind the counter made me think he was the owner but instead he was the manager.  Great location."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is the worst one I've been to. For starters, they are stingy with their food. I ordered a plate with double orange chicken and couldn't believe I could literally count out 9 pieces of chicken total! Not only that, but their food is never hot. I've given this location three chances and can officially say I won't be back."}
{"text":"I lived on Panda Express when I lived in CA. I had it all the time. And when I moved here I was sad to see no Panda Express. The closest one to me was at cedar point. And I almost went just for the food.   I think I was the most excited person to see this coming to Avon. I would pass it everyday on my way to work. And see the progress everyday. I was thrilled.   Well I went as soon as they opened. And was so sad it was so horrible. Nothing tastes the same. Everything is either soooo spicy or not cooked long enough. My favorite is the chow mein and it was so gross. I know the orange chicken says spicy on it but I could barely eat it.   And those two things were the only thing I got in CA. Orange chicken chow mein.  Avons restaurant was horrible.  The staff weren't even that friendly.   Went to the drive thru today at 4:00. Ordered mushroom chicken. Was told they were out of it for the day. For the day???? Really. You still several hours to be open. Heck you still have a dinner rush coming in and you're out of a main chicken dish for the day."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location! The staff is the friendliest I have come across! Even when this place is crazy busy, the staff stays calm, the place is clean, and everything seems to move right along. I had to wait today for my sweetfire chicken but hey, its fresh right?! The guy at the register apologized multiple times which I thought was great. Great location, great food, great service. There isn't anything else this store could do to be any better!!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the nicest Panda Express restaurants I have been to.  It is very clean and more classy than most.  It felt more like a restaurant and less like an express cafeteria.  The food was fresh and the staff was quick.  It looked like a long line when I walked in but it flowed so quick and smooth.  The Allman Brothers Band's \"Ramblin' Man\" came on my car radio when I parked and walked in and it was still going when I walked out and drove off.  Its not even that long of a song.  That tells you how fast this Panda is.  Even with the speed in which they work attitude towards the customers did not suffer.  I was not made to feel underappreciated or as an inconvenience.  Each team member down the line was polite for the duration of my time with them.  It may be subtle but it is one of those things that when done wrong sticks out like a sore thumb.    Good food, good service, good deal."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here, it's just the drive-thru service that makes pulling up to this franchise so horrible.  This visit was the second time where one of the two meals purchased was forgotten, only to be noticed after pulling forward.  $15/hr for fast food workers?  What a joke!"}
{"text":"I've read all the reviews for this Panda, and I am unconvinced that it deserves this rating. I remember going to this Panda a few times near our office between 2015-2016. The food was fine, it was just a really crowded Panda. So I really never came back.  It's now 2017, and this is now my main Panda. I go between 4-6 times a month, and every time I have ordered there has been ZERO problems. The food is always fresh here, and hell I'll sometimes wait the extra five minutes for a fresh batch if they are running low.  The restaurant is always clean in the main dining before a flock of animals come in, order, and toss their food around everywhere, and stuff the garbage to capacity during rush hour. Same goes for parents who don't watch their kids, as they are hanging off the rafters, jumping off chairs, running around in bare feet. You can't blame the staff for \"your\" bad parenting.  The staff is 100% reliable every single time I show up. They ask me what I want. I tell them exactly what it is. They stick it in the box. I pay. I leave. Anyone who is having problems is either trying to order 30 different things without planning their order ahead, and end up delaying everyone by asking each of the 10 kids they brought what they want. Yet again not Panda's fault.  Anyone who order's in the drive through should already know. You always check your bag before you leave the restaurant. Though, if you are yet again ordering for a bunch of people on the spot it gets confusing the workers are only human, and they are doing your order as you are telling them so cut them some slack you self entitled prick.   The bathrooms...They obviously get cleaned by the staff, but yet again. It is not their fault you go in there destroy the toilet, throw toilet paper on the walls, ceiling, and in the sink. So I highly doubt you tell them what you just did. You just walk out of the bathroom, and leave like nothing happened. You sir are complete utter trash, and have no respect for the utilities they provide to you.  This is a 100% truthful review. There is no embellishment of the truth. If you can't control yourself don't go to the Panda. If you see a problem. Let the staff know, not 30 minutes later when you've inhaled your food, and walking out the door."}
{"text":"Hot, Fresh, and Always Ready at this Panda Express location. Considering the fact there is limited fast food dining experiences in the area I have to say this location does a mighty fine job of on service and experience. The corner side restaurant that is also a drive through location is VERY busy. However, it is one of the few dine in spots that I can hit at lunch that has me in and out along with eating in less than an hour. So if you consider taking your lunch break here don't let the long lines scare you they are on top of things. They have the system down pat and are always well staffed. Every experience I have had at this spot has been successful. The food is always hot and your never having to wait on a specific menu option to be made those cooks are on it. The lovely cashiers are just as friendly  as can be. The drink station is in order always fully stocked with lids and condiments. The tables, chairs and floors are limited but I manage to find a seat that is clean."}
{"text":"If it was possible to leave zero stars, I would. The  food is mediocre (worse than other Panda Express). The manager recently hung up on me while I was trying to place a to go order 20 minutes before closing. He informed me that he had no food to sell.....I'm confused......long story short, DO NOT EAT HERE EVER!"}
{"text":"So they gave is an extra egg roll we brought it to their attention. They asked for it back then put it back on the serving tray after it was given to someone else. GROSS!  Iced tea dispenser, no lid with bugs floating around at service of the iced tea. I brought to their attention. They said. \"Oh don't drink tea then\" disgusting. Not recommended. Food was inedible after that. GROSS!'nn"}
{"text":"Unfriendly service, low hand cleanliness standards from the cashier,cMichael, who repeatedly scratched his soiled hat and apron and still handled food as well without washing, sanitizing or even putting gloves on his hands as a barrier for bacteria from the register, and an unaccountable shift manager that did not recognize or apologize for the situation. Definitely not going back just from being grossed out"}
{"text":"We eat there all the time but it's changed . My daughter just got me my favorite double orange chicken and fried rice and noodles as I was eating I found a Hair in my food and it wasn't mine . A month ago we ate there and my husband found a hair in his meat  we let them know they said they would only refund his meat um hell no ray started getting loud with them so they refunded all his money back . We will never return there again.  Also they were rude too my daughter."}
{"text":"Did you know you can download the panda express app, order, then just pick up your food from this store without waiting in line?  This PandaX has recently been renovated and looks good.  The key issue for any PandaX is if they keep their food fresh and in the last year this location has been keeping it fresh.  I remember that for a while in 2011-2012 they slumped a bit in the fresh department but they are way better now.  My personal favorite is the sweet fire chicken, it's got a good combo of sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"I love panda. I didn't want to go far from home so I came here and walked in about 8:53pm on Sunday and they close at 9:30. I asked for a plate with fried rice and I was told they aren't making anymore food because the close soon. Since when do you not make food until you actually close? What if I ordered online? You guys aren't going to make any more because you close soon? I feel like this is a bunch of bs and they just don't want to make more food. I'm not the only one that walked out because of this."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Got white rice and orange chicken. The rice was undercooked and crunchy. The orange chicken tasted like chicken nuggets. Pretty sure they forgot the orange sauce. Chicken was also a little over cooked and pretty dry. Also... what Panda or any Chinese food place DOES NOT have chop sticks?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express I've ever been to. I now drive to the rural and broadway Panda for how bad this place is. I ordered 3 string bean chickens. It was all string beans, as you can see in the photo. Management really needs to more staff members as there is always a 15 min wait. The Drive thru or walk in. Place takes forever to serve their customers. If you can, do yourself a favor and avoid this location."}
{"text":"I go here about once a week on the way to the gym.  They are quick and the food is fresh.  I always say when you can get food to fill you up and a drink for less than $10 you have to love it!  I like the chicken with asparagus and mandarin chicken and YES i want the sauce and YES put it on my steamed rice thanks!"}
{"text":"Horrible management. Always out of everything, every time I have been they are out of orange chicken, had to wait 12 minutes last time! 2 people in front of me and 2 people behind me all ordered different things and they were out of all the food. Chow mein was hard and under cooked. Bad attitudes and dirty kitchen. This place needs to just close shop and start over. Btw this is the only panda I have ever had a bad experience at. Just ass holes. Manager was very rude to her employees and yelling at them in from of all the customers. Just terrible experience all around. I wish I could do less than one star."}
{"text":"I made an online order and I got there 10 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. Then they made me wait 10 minutes for them to make it while I waited with my very impatient toddler (hence the online pickup). Finally I got my order 20 minutes past the time it was supposed to be done and they forgot my sauce. Absolutely ridiculous. At least the food tasted good...."}
{"text":"This is fast Chinese food, my 4 stars are because the food is fresh and the employees are so nice and friendly :)"}
{"text":"We went back again to our favorite Panda location that we had been visiting a couple times a week for the last 6-7 months. We had our normal \"bigger plate\", we both get the exact same food on both plates every time we go (Chow Mein, 2 orders of String Bean Chicken and 1 order of Beijing Beef on each plate). The food was hot and fresh and we didn't have to wait for a thing! We usually have to wait for them to cook at least 1 item, which we don't mind because its always quick and fresh, but it was a bonus that it was all ready! The employees were the same regulars that we are used to and super friendly as always! We will definitely be back again a couple times next week at this location for our same food again, no doubt! We love this Panda location and we love the delicious, fresh food and the same friendly happy faces! Thanks Panda!!!"}
{"text":"This location is new, clean & they crank out some good, fresh Mexican-made Chinese food."}
{"text":"I love panda express. Best way to get decent Chinese food fast and not at a crazy expensive price. Not to mention you can order online"}
{"text":"We were originally going to the location on Centennial Center until we realized that this one is a lot better. The employees are very nice and the make sure that everything is right before serving it. The food might be a bit pricy, but you'll realize that it's worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better locations.  Service is fast & friendly, food seems to taste better....used to have a nice outdoor seating option but that wasn't there recently.  Without it, better to just take out due to limited seating inside, especially during busy times."}
{"text":"Have to improve my first review for this location...food quality has gotten much better. I will give it another star once they don't run low or run out of the most popular items during peak periods."}
{"text":"Have never gone after 8pm as some people have warned, but I have gone and regularly stop in either right before or after a movie and think it's one of the better locations in the valley that I've tried as far as quality of food goes.  Many times when we visit other locations, it does not compare well to this one.  Food is always fresh, service is always fast, always nice & hot, nice atmosphere outside to sit and eat."}
{"text":"We visited this location on Monday night, at the end of the long labor day weekend.  Upon entering, around the same time as another individual, it was clear that it had been a slow day by the amount of ready food and there was only 1 other patron in the store(3 of us in total).  Within 30 seconds of my arriving, numerous others came in and the store was \"slammed\".  By the time I completed my order, the line was out the door and the kitchen was scrambling.  Alex, who appeared to be a manager of some sort, took orders efficiently and was effective in delegating the the kitchen and other staff how to work this situation quickly.  Under pressure, she kept her composure, and did so with a smile and positive attitude.  Kudos to Alex and the rest of the team for handling a tough situation.  My food was excellent and I really only had to wait about 5 mins."}
{"text":"2nd time I've used this location to cater our monthy Directors' Meeting.  The first time they said they'd deliver (because they're only a block away) and the food did not show up at the agreed-upon time.  They called me an hour later asking me why I hadn't come to the restaurant to pick up the food.  I told them that the Manager had specifically agreed (to my face) to deliver--again because we're only a block away.  45 minutes AFTER THAT, the food showed up.  Yesterday I placed my order for this month's meeting today, and told them that I'd pick up the food at 12:30.  Arrived at 12:30 and they hadn't even started the order.  The cashier asks the cook what is going on and (big mistake, shithead) he decides to angrily yell his response in Spanish across the kitchen in front of the \"Stupid Gringo\" that he hasn't started it yet, because it isn't due until 12:30.  He seemed quite shocked when the Stupid Gringo (who speaks fluent Spanish) answered him IN SPANISH in a less-than-pleasant fashion that it WAS 12:30 PM.  Still did not have my food 10 minutes later.  The Manager/Shift Supervisor decides to tell me in English that they're having a problem.  I respond, in Spanish, confused as to which language he and his staff should be using in front of customers (particularly because this idiot cook obviously understood English perfectly), asking why he can't deliver my food on time when I specifically confirmed this order well over 24 hours in advance.  No comp, no price reduction, nothing.  Will NEVER be eating here AGAIN!!!!!  I agree with the other reviews regarding service--and, while you're at it, probably should lose the angry vibe that permeates the kitchen.  Particularly when you just never know who can speak Spanish.  And it's absolutely unprofessional and insulting to purposely speak another language in front of your customers when you actually do have a command of English."}
{"text":"I am about to do what I NEVER thought I would do: leave a positive review of Panda Express.   Asian food has become waaaay too sweet for my taste and 10 years ago when I had the Orange Chicken, I thought, Good Lord, this isn't just sweet, isn't just too sweet, it was desert-sweet.  And I've never been back. Until a few nights ago.  I read a long post by a Panda Express chef and I found him to be interesting and compelling  Now, it's not great Asian food, but, hungry as hell, only thing open, I ordered the Pepper Chicken and Kung Pao with rice and it was not bad, pretty good, in fact.  Rice was fine, I tasted the Chow Mein and it was either undercooked, not cooked, properly, or a bad recipe.  Horrible chow mein.  Ugh.  Here's the problem: lots of the dishes are cooked fresh and that can mean a 20 minute wait in the drive-thru.  I mean it, too: not 10 minutes that feels like 20; a 20 minute wait.  Also, too many chefs?  Online, they offer a sliced Grilled Teriyaki Chicken, and it looks great in the photo, unadulterated.  It says online, \"not available in all locations\", so I called a nearby location around 2pm.  Schlub says, \"no, we don't serve that here\".  When I called back later with another question I happened to ask - again - do you serve Grilled Teriyaki Chicken?  \"Sure\", said the new guy.  So, one guy, on the crew, doesn't know a main entree is on the menu.  That's some training!  My point is, after that first Orange Chicken, I thought I'd never go back, much less give any kind of positive review, 2 stars here-and-now is a real PLUS.  Yelp says, \"two stars:  Meh. I've experienced better\" which is really pretty accurate.  But that Panda Express is even in the conversation means they've made HUGE strides!"}
{"text":"Worst panda express I've ever been to in my life! I went through the drive-through and they handed me a bag with exploded sauce. I handed the bag back to get a new one and she stuck a few napkins inside, threw them away, and gave me back the dirty bag. The girl also rolled her eyes at me heavily. When I got home, which was right around the corner, the fried rice I had gotten was hard as a rock. The broccoli from the beef broccoli I got was disgusting, and my child made had about 5 noodles total it. It was all just a bunch of large pieces of cabbage. I will never be going back to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Panda Express and always left satisfied but I went to one and they messed up my order which is stupid because i was standing right in front of them telling what i wanted and the person still managed to mess it up thats dumb and even worse they gave me attitude because they were messing up and i had to walk back in there to get something because they forgot. Totally horrible service. Most likely ruined any chances at going there again."}
{"text":"One thing is always consistent with Panda Express.  It's always bad..  Why do I do this to my self?"}
{"text":"I was there at 10:15 am they said open at 10:30. U went back at 10:30 , food not even ready all trays are empty i have to wait 20 min to get my food."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food I love their Beijing Beef!!!  However they have long lines but that's due to the popularity here"}
{"text":"Pretty fast and the place is clean. The food can be dry sometimes but I guess that is what u get when u want fast food anything.  I really do wish that when they say spicy they mean spicy. I always order what ever they have that is spicy and I get it and I taste 0 spice. Maybe one day."}
{"text":"Panda Express is a great place to eat and a nice alternative to typical \"fast\" food. The entree's here are consistently rated the best healthy alternative to eat from publications such as Men's Health magazine. They use only fresh vegetables cut daily and high quality meats. None of the meals are served with MSG.   This is a very nice location. The restaurant is kept very clean. The ladies behind the counter are friendly. They move customers quickly and efficiently through the line.   I have only been to a couple of Panda Expresses in town and by no means an expert but based on what I have seen I think the portions here are very large. I recommend asking for the\"to go\"plate even if you are eating in. The \"to go\" portion does appear to be a little larger than the \"eating in\" plate.  I like the Black Pepper Chicken and the Mango Chicken with Fried Rice."}
{"text":"It would be really helpful if they told you they were out of a certain entree while ordering from the drive thru, I usually go the drive thru route for connivence but does the complete opposite when I sit at the window after paying for 5 min before they ask me to drive up front because the entree isn't even made yet. This location definitely needs to step up their customer service game."}
{"text":"Not real Chinese food but pretty good price, beware of a fake begger there in that area asking for money, I offer him food in panda express but got refused, one hour later he was still there begging for money from other people"}
{"text":"First time coming to this location, wasn't greeted when I came through the door but the girl who took my order seemed like she was in a rush to get my orderdone and go on a lunch break. Food was amazing and fresh, she did a good job on up selling me on chicken rolls. Bathrooms weren't clean they should check at least every hour."}
{"text":"I love Panda, just not this one. They take poor customer service to the extreme. The drive thru line will always take you 30 mins, no matter what. They never have all of the food options ready, so you have to sit and wait. They'll tell you to pull forward and that they'll bring your food out to you, but then they'll forget about you and cop an attitude with you when you have to go after your missing food. Terrible always."}
{"text":"I spoke with Manager to tell him how pleasant each worker was...I sat an ate and observed cheerful personalities and very helpful employees across the board, they really appeared to enjoy their jobs and most definitely enjoyed people...young workers too with no attitude and a commitment to customer service, very refreshing"}
{"text":"I ordered teriyaki chicken and steamed rice from this place and was poisoned by the chicken, not only will I never eat at this location; I will never eat at this franchise EVER again!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this panda no stars at all. This is the worst panda I have ever been to. Every time I go through the drive thru I always wait at least 10 minutes. It seems as if they are never prepared. I recently went to pick up some lunch before school. I was craving Panda and decided Id just stop here to get it out of the way. I had ordered my usual bowl with fried rice and orange chicken along with a large dr. pepper. Now on the drive thru menu the price for my drink was 1.80 when he rung me up it was 1.90 so my grandma had asked the guy (His name was Eddie) about the price difference. He was quick to get attitude with her. He said, \"Well Im not the one who's in charge of the prices\" All she asked was a simple question that could've had a simple response. He then kept trying to talk over her so my grandma asked for a manger and he then rolled his eyes. He got his manager who was more than helpful. Apparently Pandas prices had changed within a day. I will be taking my money elsewhere. The food at this location wasn't even that great anyways."}
{"text":"Over priced SMALL portion with a burnt ass Chicken Egg Roll. This place has gone down along with the quality of their food. Don't think twice, keep driving. This Panda Express SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru and ended up waiting almost 20 mins then when I finally got my food it was cold. I ordered the beef and broccoli but all I got was broccoli.."}
{"text":"Food is almost always good here. Been coming here for years now but have  been disappointed the last few visits. Ordered the Beijing beef according to the label but lately its been like ordering peppers and onions with two pieces of beef. Same with the eggplant tofu. Been getting only tofu and peppers. Asked server politely if she could add more eggplant but was pleasantly ignored. Oh well it is only Panda i guess. The register lady needs to smile more. Still a overall good Panda as ive been to way worse locations."}
{"text":"Service is not good here. Takes to long to get your food and when you want something you have to wait for it to cook. Vary unorganized"}
{"text":"Sorry to be a chain lover but i think Panda is awesome. yes it's not the most authentic thing around but it's tasty and if you pick the right dishes fairly healthy too.  Also the PE here is just a little more pricey then a PE outside of Vegas so that means it's very affordable if you get tired of BS Las Vegas prices for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Your standard Panda Express with the typical, salt-laden dishes but the prices are decent for the Strip and it is super fast!"}
{"text":"Decent and very convenient location that is open until 2 am. The food us your standard fast food fare but the service is very fast and friendly and it's nice to be able to grab a bite after a night out that is not McDonalds or pizza. I usually stick to the mushroom chicken or spareribs."}
{"text":"Went by this place so many times and skipped out on going here but I came today to try it out. I heard a lot of good things about Panda Express (in the states) so I was expecting Panda Express in Calgary to be pretty good as well. I came in at around 7 PM, now considering that it was getting near to the end of day, the food wasn't fresh. The chow mein noodles had the consistency like dried rubber bands. I also had the mixed vegetables and they had to cook it because there weren't any. It came out hard, barely even cooked. I brought it back asking to get it cooked a second time as it had carrots, cabbage and broccoli that were still raw. It came back a second time and they weren't as cooked as I had hoped. As the entrees, I got orange chicken, Beijing beef and chicken and mushroom. The orange chicken and Beijing beef, again were probably old. It was a little cold. The chicken and mushroom were incredibly salted.   I got the bigger meal (3 entrees, 1 side) for $11.30 and honestly didn't get through more than a quarter of the food. Seriously underwhelming.. I feel like you're better off at your local Chinese restaurant. I'm sure it's because I came at such a late hour however can't say I'll be back. Wish I took pictures."}
{"text":"Great place, people work fast and that Cynthia girl was moving like she was on fire, definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"The Panda Express dinner was quite delicious and freshly prepared. The employees show passion in their job and are very professional. The Panda Express restaurant was very clean. All of the employees work together as a team and I really enjoyed the atompshere."}
{"text":"This Panda Express restaurant did a wonderful job. They have a fantastic team that serves delicious food. This particular Panda Express restaurant is very clean and organized. The manager does an outstanding job. The team members communicate very well. Thank you for a pleasant meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"Whats not to love about Panda Express!!!!  I love this location because it is conveniently located a few miles from my house. I love to go when they are most busy such as a Friday, Saturday night, or 2 hours before they close. I like going during their busiest time because they're always cooking fresh food and the food is always good. I went one time before when they weren't busy and the employees were happy for cook me a fresh serving of whatever I was ordering.  I like how you are able to sample different things while you order your food. It reminds me of the Chinese places in the mall without the shouting lol. I also like if their is a menu item that you want and you don't see it out or low, you can simply ask the employees to cook you a fresher serving of it. Of course you have to wait for it but they kindly offer you a courtesy cup of anything from the drink area. Also, if you complete the brief survey on the back of your receipt you get a free item.  My favorite is the the plate combo with half chow mien and half fried rice. I order the delicious honey walnut shrimp and yummy orange chicken with a side of fresh cream cheese rangoon. I also have plenty left over for lunch the next day or my breakfast lol."}
{"text":"I reluctantly give 1-star to this particular store as I would prefer to give a zero star rating. Unfortunately, Yelp does not offer the option to rate a restaurant or other business below 1-star.     Since my husband and I are workaholics, we often order food delivery or walk-in to pickup  dinner to-go. Tonight we decided to patron Panda Express on Silverado Ranch and Maryland parkway.  Long story short, the \"so called\" lo mein noodles were the worst we've ever had. The noodles were tasteless, dry and similar to what Top Ramen noodles might resemble if pan-fried, over-cooked and sat under a heat-lamp for who knows how long...yeck!  The orange chicken wasn't much better - tasteless and cold by the time I arrived home [ 2 minute drive].   On the upside, the spring rolls were adequate, but decent spring rolls are not enough to encourage repeat business in my opinion."}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed, and there was a line that wrapped around the inside, waiting to order. The people behind the counter were so quick and efficient that it seemed to take no time at all for us to be able to place our order. Every employee was extremely pleasant, greeting everyone with smiles in their voices as well as on their faces. I saw a new item that I had not seen before, and was offered a sample to taste. The Manager was right on top of making certain all the various dishes were available, so nobody had to wait for anything to be cooked. She continually advised the chefs as to what was running low. The staff all seemed to be happy to be there, which is very refreshing. The crew operated as a team, which was nice to see. They were in constant communication with each other, advising the next person down the packaging line as to what was needed to complete our order. We never felt we were imposing on them by being there, which is not always the case in other locations. Everyone seemed to be extremely efficient, and we moved quickly through the line, from placing our order, to having it boxed, to paying for it. We even received the correct sauces that we requested."}
{"text":"I love panda express but NEVER in my life have I experienced FOOD POISONING! Bought honey walnut shrimp and beef and broccoli with a side of fried rice. Food tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. Literally 45 minutes after eating started feeling queasy and nauseous, then BOOM! Been stuck in the hotel room ever since yesterday! I'm upstairs! Right now! cuz of that stupid motherf*#!ing squalor Buffalo Bills calls a \"restaurant\". Had to post asap to forewarn other visitors. & the sad part is that I'm a frequent buffalo bills/ primm guest :( I'm so disappointed right now.   I'm not saying panda express is a bad place to get food but STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!"}
{"text":"Typically, I love me some Panda Express but with this one, its hit or miss. If you go around 6pm, All the food is fresh. Yes, you will most likely have to wait for something to be done cooking but that it is usually worth it. If you go any later than 7pm, expect to have some soggy a$$ meat. I have always been used to having my container be overfilled with goodness, but there are a couple individuals here that like to jip you on your food. One time my boyfriend ordered some steak entree, which you pay an extra dollar for, and we came home and there was ONE piece of steak in it. All the rest was vegetables. Very disappointing. We only really go here now if we are really desperate. And it must be around 6 otherwise we wont even go. We aren't down with the soggy food."}
{"text":"Great place! Crew is very accommodating and customer-oriented. My biggest concern if for the crew themselves. They seem to be overworked! I feel like there should be 3 workers up front (one for sides, one for entrees, one cashier). There is always only 2 and whether it's busy or not, they are running all over the place. I typically go to the one on the UNCC campus and that's what they do."}
{"text":"What I like the most about this place is that every time I come here is ALWAYS clean, food is good and service I can't complain so far."}
{"text":"i'm not a big fan of chinese food but i absolutely love panda express and i love it even more in vegas when my pockets are swollen and my stomach is growling. yummy!"}
{"text":"There were several people in line in front of me, so I waited my turn.  The server asked me what I wanted so I told her I didn't want any sides, only entrees, so I kept moving through the line waiting my turn.  The last server tried to take the person behind me ignoring me.  Then she asked me what I wanted, so I told her my choice. She said you have to go to the back of the line.  I told her I'd waited my turn already, but she didn't listen.  I spoke to the manager and he said he'd heard part of it but not all.  If he did, why didn't he speak up?  The server was extremely rude. Why didn't she simply ask me if I'd went through the line?  I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Standard Panda Express.  The orange chicken and Beijing beef are always cooked well.  The fortune cookies have pretty strange messages here"}
{"text":"This is one of the best locations I have been to. There customer service is excellent Tammy, Jaydin, Zamantha ,and Shannon are such a delight. The cooks always make sure everything is fresh, and the restaurant is very clean. DEFINITELY will be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few items for takeout.  Chicken teriyaki bowl was one item. She forgot the sauce. It was rather dry but already at home so ate it anyway as it was getting late."}
{"text":"I live near this location and I have eaten here regularly for the past decade. Off and on quality usually, but passable and we eat there regularly.  Recently in the last few months the quality and service has gone very downhill. Ate there today and our food was practically inedible. Green bean chicken was overcooked, could not even eat the green beans they were so hard.  Amount of oil left on the bottom of the plate was disgusting.  The mixed vegetables were so undercooked they were raw.  My daughter's chow mein was overcooked and crunchy to bite into.  Inedible.  The spice in the orange chicken has notably increased and daughter would not even eat it (her normally favorite dish).  I will never go to this location again.  On top of all that, the four servers/staff who were there were laughing, giggling, and acting like immature 12-year-olds instead of giving good customer service.  Totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"I'm filling so bad to be the first one to make a first rew with one star. The girls works in the cashier come to my with very bad attitude.so I bought 5 meals for my friends and 3 drinks and 2 cups for water.i wanted to taste a drink and I used the water cup instead of the drink cup.she left the custemers and she came to me rite away to tell me that that's not water in the cup.so I said I just wanted to taste that drink before I fill my drink cup Her name was Chris and she was ruuuuuuuuude"}
{"text":"Tables were dirty, soda bibs were out, and saw a roach crawling around the outside of the foodbar. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I really like this Panda Express. I usually get takeout and the portions are typically pretty consistent. There are times where the server is a little stingy but that doesn't seem to be the norm. The menu is fairly simple with not a lot to choose from, but everything is made fresh and cooked throughout the day. My favorites are the Beijing Beef and Firecracker Chicken...both are crispy in the most delicious sauce."}
{"text":"Service was ok.... Slow but ok.  Here is my issue there are a LOT of food safety rules being broken here, they need an manager on.  Currently there is not one ( least not when I asked for one).  The restaurant is filthy, several items are cross contaminating others...ie chicken with beef.  The egg rolls are mixed with the spring rolls and are burnt... Very burnt.  The bejing beef was really really burnt, but because of the sauce you can't tell you you start eating... Not pleasant.  A customer returned some after eating and the server scraped it out of her box ( that she was eating out of) and into the full serving pan.  Wth? Gross even eaten noodles went in.... So I politely tell the one in charge ( who never once got off her cell phone when I was talking) and then they never removed it... Till they went to serve someone and I said absolutely no.. So they pulled it out and didn't throw it... They put it in the drive thru... Pretty sure they still served it to the person in the drive thru.  The cooks... Also teens.  Just thought was funny.  Please just put one grown up in the schedule at least."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times when my service matched the one and two star reviews, however today the food was excellent and I was offered free samples.  The restaurant was clean.  My only gripe with today was the speed of greeting and I would really like to see some happiness to see a customer vs just someone politely doing their job.  I would come again."}
{"text":"I hate taking bad reviews public but this specific location will not get their stuff together after multiple comments on their surveys. Each time I go to this location I stand in line for 8+ minutes when there is only one person in front of me. Then I have to wait another 10 minutes because I request to have my food freshly made since the food they have out looks like it has been sitting for hours. I don't mind waiting for fresh food. But the reasoning for the one star review is that the customer service is just terrible. The workers that were there didn't care that people were waiting 8+ minutes before being served. They had no sense of urgency. Maybe it is because I came in an hour before close so they are trying to get out early and have minimal waste? Regardless, the customer should be priority over pre-closing."}
{"text":"I walk into the establishment around 10:20 am. And I was just thinking of getting some teriyaki chicken, I check the display and there's so chicken. So I ask the lady how long it'll take and she says \"about 10 minutes\" in my head I think that's fine, there's 4 people ahead of me anyway.   The lady in front of had ordered an order the day before and was here for pick up, she had payed online and everything. The worker says \"oh I see the order in office but no one told us\" wow lack of communication for sure. And she tells the it'll be 15 minutes, and the lady is fine with it. To me, if I placed an order a day before to have it ready at a certain time and I arrive at that time and it's not ready I would think that's rather inconvenient.   Anyway, about 8 minutes later it's my time to order, and I want some chow mein but they don't have any, which is fine. I get an order of white rice and I ask about the teriyaki chicken again, and the work again (the same one) tells me that it'll be about 10 minutes. But wait, didn't you just tell me it'll be about 10 minutes, about 10 minutes ago? She just tells me \"well they're still cooking it\" so I settle for some other options that I hadn't even set my mind to. This whole time she acted like she had an attitude, I understand you might be a little stressed ( even though there was only 5 customers in the whole establishment) but there's no reason to have an attitude and be slightly rude.   All in all, they're lack of communication and poor customer service here really was a turn down for me."}
{"text":"4 stars for being the only fast food fast food place in Vegas.  We were in a rush to get to the Cosmo Outdoor show for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Everything we walked by were either sit down restaurants or long lined fast food places. This was the only fast food fast food place we were able to find.  Prices were high though but I guess regular considering it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Rang up our order wrong, ran credit card three times trying to accomplish refund. Orange chicken was old and dry. Terrible."}
{"text":"Its not perfect.. Sometimes the noodles are over done. But for fast food, it is one of the best ones in town. If Harry is there running it be sure and say HI, and tell them Fred sent you in !"}
{"text":"I came in and was told they were out of the chicken. At first was disappointed but in this world things happen and it was just orange chicken and so I ordered some 1/2 fried rice and 1/2 chow mein bajing beef and teriyaki chicken instead and was supper excited she told me I would need to wait about 5-10 minutes for the beef and she said she would give me fresh rice cause more was coming out. Again food does make its self and obviously it takes time and stuff happens. I didn't mind waiting at all. So she calls me up and the lady kinda had an attitude and told me their grill was down and I could pick something else and I told her that funny because the other lady said he was making it and she turned around and asked the other employee why they were making more food when it was 9:30 and they close at 10. The other lady who seemed like her boss said that it was already being made. I sat down waited and the lady called me back up 10 mins later and again with an attitude gave me my bag of food. I get home open it up and what do you know the Beijing I waited for was missing and the rice I didn't even care if I had what was left was also missing. Called and no help."}
{"text":"This location is my go to spot. I have yet to come here and have the orange chicken completely gone / waiting for another batch. They always have the next batch ready to go and I appreciate that so much.   Also, the staff has always been nice to me, as well as others. They're patient when customers ask for the weirdest requests (like avoiding the veggies in the chow mien....). This last time I came (6:30PM PST) , it was SUPER busy. Like, line to the door, busy. I've never experienced that, but I personally thought the line moved fast. I'm sure there's peak times like lunch or dinner, but minus this last round, I've been lucky to avoid all of it. So, more reason for me to keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Shitty food, shitty service. It's a place to get microwaved chinese food at a premium. Not a fan of just about anything they sell. If I do venture here, I tend to get orange chicken and beef and broccoli. Both are at best mediocre. Go elsewhere unless you're drunk and dgaf about quality"}
{"text":"The location is set up very similar to the one across from the Boulevard Mall on Maryland Parkway, except it is slightly larger, so there is more room.   The employees were very nice here- smiles, welcome greetings, and offered samples, too. (I tried a different type of shrimp, but opted for the one I originally wanted.) They were hard-working. They were cleaning tables vacated as the restaurant was getting busy with the lunch rush. There was also lots of cooking as well, since the line was getting longer and longer after we were seated.    Our picky son loves the beef and broccoli dish- it is one of his favorites! He doesn't even want to try other things on the menu here. We noticed that his meal was mostly broccoli, so my husband went to the manager and the problem was corrected. Kudos for not giving us a problem with it. I had the bowl with honey walnut shrimp (I'm pretty sure that I'll get that one again, next time) and hubby had a two item plate with chow mein. Everything was very good. (I notice that the menu items are rotating, almost like the brand is testing which ones do well with customers and therefore stay on the regular menu. It is a good thing that they do this. I also always do the surveys (within 7 days) in order to cash in on their promo- this is an ongoing thing.) I should also mention that this is one of my husband's favorite chain places for fast chinese food.   There are sooooooo many restaurant choices in the immediate area, so there is lots of competition, since it is across from an outlet mall (yes, there are more yummy choices inside the mall as well). It's nice to know that this is a pretty dependable place. It also helps that the staff is eager to please their customers in order to keep them loyal (we are locals, I'm sure that the crowd around here is more tourists). Anyway, I'm sure we will be back sometime."}
{"text":"I have been sitting in the drive through for almost 30 minutes. Every single time I come to this location it takes forever. Horrible service. Not even a token \"sorry for the wait\"."}
{"text":"When you want something quick on this side of town, Chinese, and reasonable, this is the place to go- been going to this one for years. I usually get the bowl with half white rice and half vegetables, with either the beef and broccoli or the mushroom chicken. I don't finish it, I save half for later. My husband gets the two item with half fried rice, half chow mein- beef & broccoli and orange chicken. Sometimes he gets the pork but only if it's lean. Sometimes, we each get an eggroll (when you complete the receipt survey within 2 days, this could be free). Fortune cookies come with your meals.  Uniform design for this fast food chain restaurant. Most of these restaurants are decorated the same: panda prints, red paint, tables/chairs, bar type tables/chairs. Free refills on sodas. Bathroom in one corner. Open kitchen- cut veggies in clear bins kept in the refrigerator- I love that, though sometimes the veggies are pretty chunky. Most of the food trays were full. There were three people working. This is a fairly busy but clean location that shares the parking lot with McDonald's. It wasn't as busy yesterday but then again, we got there past 1 pm though. Several strip malls in the area and close to the Boulevard Mall- convenient location."}
{"text":"The lunch rush was crazy busy (long line here), but we managed to get a seat nearby (doesn't seem to get busy in the food court, like it used to be). The food was good--- there was nothing wrong with mine (hence my rating): fried rice, beef with broccoli, and sweet fire chicken (the boy & I split this), except my husband had lots of chicken pieces containing joints (the problem with getting chicken thighs; if it were me, I have to dispose these parts into a napkin, 'cause I don't like eating this); more so than other PE locations, he noticed.   Anyway, a good value overall, two item plate; usually have leftovers. I always eat the fortune cookies (something I grew up with; in my childhood, we often went to Chinese restaurants on special occasions, the last being my high school graduation night dinner). If you do the survey on the receipt, you get a free item, when you buy a two item combo. As with all their locations, free drink refills.    There's only one other place here in the food court, that I like to eat, but we usually get PE a couple times a month, 'cause well, my hubby and son are big fans (consistent, fast, convenient, chinese food)."}
{"text":"This location is in the Venetian food court on the 2nd level Canale Shoppes. The food here is far below the normal standard of PE. The first item I got (kung pao chicken) was an absolute salt bomb - burn your mouth levels! I couldn't eat it so I went back and told the cashier and she semi-reluctantly replaced it with another item. The broccoli beef I got next tasted fine but the broccoli must not have been cleaned well. I got crunchy bits in it from time to time, probably from dirt that was not washed off. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Wasted stop every employee was on their phone line was long and the food that was out looked horrible. Poor service and poor quality we left without food"}
{"text":"I'm alway low key ashamed when I walk into Panda Express. It's like Mexican person walking into a Taco Bell , but their orange chicken it's good and Kung pao chicken Black pepper  Location close to my work.the food little so sweet"}
{"text":"Pretty much any other Panda Express I would give a 3 star rating, but this is the second time in a row that my food was stale.  The coating on the orange chicken had turned into some sort of crystallized membrane.  I also witnessed them mixing in an old batch of food in with a new tray.  This is a serious health code violation.  At 9 bucks for noodles, two entrees, and a soda it's almost better to go to an all you can eat chinese buffet for around the same price.  When ordering \"to go\" they never include utensils.  It really sucks when you come home and realize that you don't have a fork."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express, I've never had a problem with the food at this location, it's just that I've gotten some mean glares from the girls behind the counter. I've thought about working here but remembered all the catty girls that already work here. It's not that big of a problem, it's just immature and unprofessional that I'm being given the evil eye every time I come in."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter came at this store at 9:20 pm and the lights where turned off and the employee did not even open the door  The store hours are till 9:30   This is not acceptable, employee land stores like this make the life difficult for every one    Will never come at this libation"}
{"text":"PANDA express...same everywhere except for the level of crispness with certain items depending upon who's the cook, and how long the foods been sitting out.   I always get the same old orange chicken, Beijing beef, or Kung pao chicken. I always sample before I order, because some days they have that crispy orange chicken, and on others, it's soggy.    This location has consistently had soggy orange chicken on my last 4 visits, so I have defaulted to Beijing beef, which has somehow managed to be cooked to a nice crisp.   Panda, always there to serve you in your cravings for a quick fix Americanized Chinese food."}
{"text":"This food was disgustingly dry and looked like it was left over from the previous day. Poor customer service as well. We paid 30 dollars for 2 meals. For that price I expect a higher quality than dry burnt garbage!!! Would rate -5 of I could!!!"}
{"text":"I would totally rate this place ZERO stars if I could. They are constantly out of food like ALLLLLLLLL the time. I always have to wait 15-17 minutes for either orange chicken or teriyaki chicken... I get it.. you're busy.. however this shouldn't be my problem every single time I come here. This is for sure my last and final time at this location. I come here frequently since live down the street. Not to mention the staff seems to be bugged EVERY SINGLE TIME I come in here. I've found hair in my food before and never complained but this time it has pushed me over the edge. There are maybe 7 orders in front of me waiting for food as I type this in the restaurant. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Fast food Chinese at its true form. Here you find portion sizes that are large enough to fit seconds and quite possibly thirds. I ordered the 3 entree and a side. Not bad at all for the price of under 10 bucks. Warning, it is yummy so it is possible to eat it all. I on this particular visit had some self control and brought some home.   For starter I went with the Crab Rangoons. Always a fav and these tasted fresh. Pro tip for the sides. Get half lo mein and half fried rice if you can't decide. The three dishes I got were Peking Pork, Orange chicken, and Kung Pao chicken. All were tasty. Only recommendation would be to add General Tso's as an option   I will be back to grab some fast food Chinese from this place again.Another bonus is this location is not too far from the house and will be a great Friday night dinner to pick up on the way home"}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express EVER!  Do not go.  The food is never fresh and they never have any food prepared.  The mixed vegetables looked like they were out for 5 days.  The employees are rude and the kid at the counter today was unsanitary (rubbing his nose) and completely rude.  He basically threw my bag of food at me and had items completely turned over in the bag.  Terrible place.  I have come here a few times and it never gets any better.  I called and spoke with the manager, Rafael, and he seemed apathetic and unapologetic."}
{"text":"I've heard really bad reviews about this location, but I've had panda express at other locations so I decided I was going to try it (since I haven't had panda express in a long time). It was better than I expected. The service was good they had everything I wanted and at a decent amount of waiting time. When I got home to eat, I realized I wasted my money buying the cream cheese rangoon. They were way too overcooked and tasteless (definetly not impressed). My teriyaki chicken tasted good and so did my fried rice. My husband said his sweet fire chicken was good, orange chicken was the best he's had in a while, and beef broccoli wasn't very impressive at all. His egg roll wasn't tasty either. So since we had such mixed reviews I'll go with 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"On a scale from 1-10, the customer service at this location is a hard \"1\". I placed an online order which was scheduled to be ready at 12:05. I arrived at 12:10 expecting to be in and out within a few minutes, however after waiting 10 minutes at the \"online pick-up\" register, the cashier who greeted me and stated he would check on my order completely forgot until the manager came and asked me if I was being helped. After some searching, they stated that my order was never made."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here during lunch.. you'll be expected to wait 15 to 25 minutes in drive thru. Food always seems flavorless and customer service isn't in their vocabulary."}
{"text":"I have given them three tries just because of the convenient location.   The first time I had to wait forever for teriyaki chicken they said they would bring it out when it was ready I watched them give my chicken away twice before I went up and stood there after 20 minutes.  The second time I went through the drive through.  I was told to pull around they would bring my food out, they never came and I had to go in plus they forgot an item in my order and I had to go back.  Wednesday I went for one last try and they were out of sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"Avoid! I have been waiting in line for 20 minutes even tho they have lots of staff. The line wraps around the whole inside of thr building"}
{"text":"My first encounter with a drive-thru Panda Express. This location is modern and brand new. They are fast. My 2-item plate, drink and receipt took less than a minute while being at the window. Great service and finally a panda with a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Okay, so we all know that Panda isn't really Chinese food - just like Taco Bell isn't really Mexican food. Although good luck telling that to a group of screaming kids riding in the back of Mom's oversized SUV and ordering disturbingly large amounts of meat and rice. The fact is, people love their Panda, even though I didn't realize just how much until recently.  You see, I used to occasionally go to this location years ago, during the earlier days of this Lake Pleasant area before most people knew it existed. Things were different back then and from what I can remember, ran much more smoothly.  As you can see from other reviews, this particular location has quickly developed a well-known reputation for notoriously long drive-thru wait times. I chuckled when one reviewer complained about it taking ten minutes. Another clocked in at thirteen minutes. Oh, the horror!  Try a solid 45 minutes that I clocked from the time it took to get through the line and acquire my food on a recent Tuesday night at 7pm. And that is not an exaggeration. In fact, the only reason I was forced to endure the wait was because I was trapped in the line and unable to leave.   No apology. No acknowledgement that anything was wrong. And no attempt to rectify the situation. Apparently, the \"Express\" in Panda is a failed attempt at humor, because that's the absolutely last thing they seem to be able to provide here.   The food itself is fine. As I was eating my orange chicken and fried rice, I briefly wondered why I don't work Panda into my weekly rotations more often. But then, I glanced at the clock and realized how late I was eating dinner as a result of their frustratingly slow service.  Come on, guys! If you can't accommodate the crowds, then just abolish drive-thru all together and rebrand yourself as a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"As far as Panda Express' go, this one ranks near the bottom. As a plus, they're open 24 hours a day, so this is an ideal spot for a 3 a.m. meal when you're in a drunken stupor. The downside is that, unless you get REALLY lucky and walk up right as they're putting down some fresh food, chances are you'll wind up eating something that looks (and tastes) like it was made hours ago. Panda can be tasty quick Chinese food when it's fresh & hot, but after it's been sitting for a couple of hours it starts to practically decompose, leaving you with a plate full of nasty crap. I couldn't tell you a good time to stop in to this one, but at least it's located in a food court with a few other places that'll do if this isn't looking up to snuff."}
{"text":"Food here is not up to the normal Panda Express standard.   1. Noodles were dry 2. Vegetable spring rolls tasted \"off\"  3. The food here made my stomach upset afterwards.  This location could use some help bringing their standards back up to the corporate expectations."}
{"text":"I've never had Panda Express before. My expectations were basically food-court style Chinese food. For $7, I had the orange chicken, kung pao chicken, fried rice, chow mein noodles, and a medium drink. I have to say, it was actually really good for the price point.   Regarding the first few reviews, this place is brand new, so there will be a few kinks to work out. Let's give them a chance."}
{"text":"My son and I always go here for lunch! I really like it, but you know like any other typical PE wha are you gonna get? Orange chicken, haha. The girl server is super nice and hella quick, and the cashier is also sweet.  The lo mein is yummy as is the chicken with green beans! Jyst thinking about it right now is making me hungry!   We will go back whenever we're down there!"}
{"text":"My friend really wanted panda so she went in and for 10 minutes she stood there while they continued to clean right in front of her. she eventually walked out but i can't believe they intentionally ignored her."}
{"text":"No parking in the parking lot so I decided to hit the drive-thru. Asked me to pull around cause orange chicken wasn't done. Waited for 10 minutes. Also forgot my spring rolls. So had To wait in drive-they line again because of no parking. The girl working the window was nice. I believe Myla was her name. Food was good. Only way I will return is if there is parking."}
{"text":"I dont like the fact that they ask you \"half n half\"? Fried rice and chow mein? and yet the give you 3/4 rice and a qtr chow mein. Their portions are so small and still charge you full price!"}
{"text":"I said half and half dammit!!! Not 3/4 rice and 1/4 chow mein!! Small portions served, but have no problem charging you fast. not coming back here again Get it right and stop being greedy with the food!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch one day and the orange chicken looked old. I asked if they would make some fresh and they tried to persuade me to take the old stuff. I wasn't interested. The cooks took their time, and after a lengthy wait, fresh orange chicken arrived. Did I get the fresh stuff? Nope. The girl behind the counter scooped the old food right into my to-go box. Sorry. I had just waited for nothing with my infant? I called her out and asked her to replace my food with what I had asked for. She rolled her eyes at me and began hugging and puffing to the other girl behind the register in Spanish. Pretty rude. They only reason I'm giving this review two stars is because the fresh orange chicken was great. Please step up the customer service here, guys!"}
{"text":"A quick snack before heading home, a stop at panda. The meat was flavorful and customer service was surprisingly very nice! The line was out the door this late at night, yet they managed to get us in and out quick. Our experience here was an overall nice one. Will be back within do time!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service wasn't as good, I ordered chow mien, chicken teriyaki and broccoli with beef. They took forever to continue sliding my food down and as one female employees stared my order off she walked away to the back and let my food sit before another female employee continued w/my order. There was no teriyaki sauce ready, not only that I also wanted a chicken egg roll. I didn't get offered one I had to ask for one, I also had to ask for a fortune cookie, my drink and my teriyaki sauce.   Overall great food, but next time I'll be going through the drive thru. To"}
{"text":"Service here was completely unacceptable, me and my boyfriend work rite next door to each other and today we chose Panda Express.. Bad idea, as soon as we walked in we waited about 2 mins before we were acknowledged because the guy serving food was helping someone else even though there was 2 more people down by the register doing nothing at all, once we finally got seen my bf ordered his first which was a bowl of white rice and orange chicken, I still didn't get helped til two mins later. ( I kid you not we both stood there for two mins) I finally got asked wat would I like ((I'm guessing it was by the manager cause he was the only one wearing black!)) I told him a bowl with fried rice and teriyaki chicken, the fired rice was all gonna and he yelled FRIED RICE I'm guessing so they can get started on making more. He then asked wat entrée would I like I said chicken teriyaki, which was pretty much all gone I got the last of the last which was not a good sight or feeling. (If I'm already waiting for fresh food why not just wait for fresh chicken??) Anyway a lady then put my chicken teriyaki to the side on two little paper plates I go to the bathroom and I come out, the fried rice still isn't done!! I am sitting there waiting for them to finish the fried rice while my boyfriend is trying not to eat because keep in mind he already got his food about eight minutes ago they finally finished the fried rice and a teriyaki chicken isn't hot anymore I definitely will not be coming back to this place and when I finally did get to eat most of my chicken teriyaki was fat pieces of chicken I was so upset to the point I didn't even want to eat. This place needs to fire and hire a all new staff because everyone here SUCKED!! I should of read the ratings before coming here. I see why they only have two stars ."}
{"text":"I waited 15 minutes to get an uncomplete order.  I tried asking one of your employees if i could change my veggie egg rolls to a chicken one,  she said the next girl would do it but she was so busy i never got a chance to say anything to her.  I was rushed from the beginning to know my exact order without being able to see all my options (if i wanted that i would have went through the drive through). Came home and didn't have the potstickers i paid for. Just checked my bag and didnt even get sweet and sour for the eggrolls. Im not driving all the way back and I'm highly annoyed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"9:24pm on a Tues and at least 50% of the food is put away and the entrees that are there and offered are barely filled to choose from. This places advertises they close at 10:00pm. I'm shaking my head. I left because there's nothing to choose from. I guess the employees and cook(s) are eager to leave and be done with their closing duties by 10:00pm. I'm pissed cause I was really craving panda, instead, I have to take the time and write a poor review on this location."}
{"text":"The staff was super nice and friendly, the service was fast and the food fresh. Best panda I've ever being in."}
{"text":"I was trying to find a panda and decided to come to this one. The staff is very friendly and offering of making something fresh when it is low( most pandas unless they are completely out or you request won't make something fresh) chow mein was delicious as usual, they have changed their orange chicken recipes because it is bomb now, I also got beef and broccoli I was to satisfied with the broccoli had a funny taste not sure what it was but everything else was really good."}
{"text":"I think the staff did an excellent job for how busy they were. Jennifer has worked there a long time, she is a great employee. She was the one trying to keep the unhappy people or online orders straightened out. Kudos to her. Service with a smile. I don't think there is a manager at this location. The old manager was promoted and I don't think he has been replaced. I haven't seen one the last few times I was there. The food is consistently good at this location. But, they are busy most of the time."}
{"text":"The first Panda Express I seen with a drive thro. This has to be the worst PE i been to for customer service. Walked in there was no line, yet i waited 5 minutes to get asked if i was ready to order, worst part the employees were standing right there in front of me the whole time talking, there was an abundance of employees but apparently they had a lot to talk about. even going tho the line of food from getting my rice to picking my meats they would stop and talk! like hello!! and once i got to the cashier to pay the guy didnt know how to use the register. He said he worked there 3 years. They get one star because they food was hot and tasted good."}
{"text":"It was pretty cool. Service was nice and fast but my chow mein was pretty dry and the beef and broccoli just didn't taste like beef and broccoli. Giving it 3 stars because the orange chicken was awesome :)"}
{"text":"Yet another terrible experience from Panda... Lately my husband and I have had been coming here quite often for dinner; the food is delicious and the quality/quanity is fair for the price! However the customer service and perhaps management needs to be closely evaluated. The sign on the door said opens at 10am (this was a Tuesday) at 10:02am they still were not open (see attached photos) the lights weren't even on! They didn't open the doors till 10:05am (causing me to be running behind by 5minutes now) they finally opened the door however there was very little options as they didn't have all their food ready and stocked... Why advertise you're open at 10am if you're not and you don't have all the food ready...?"}
{"text":"My room mate and I come here once or twice per week due to it being on the way to school. The last three times I have gone have made me vow to choose one of the other food options in the area. First time the chicken was undercooked, second time I showed up at 10:58 and was told I was too early and needed to wait by a young lady with a very poor tone, and the third time I was told the drive through was closed, something which has happened to my room mate twice. I always wondered why the ratings were low for this branch and now I know the opening shift is responsible."}
{"text":"I had the Chow Mei with orange chicken bacon, honey sesame chicken breast and honey walnut shrimp, The food was plenty and greasy as you would expect it from Pandy Express. I liked it tough, the prices are very reasonable and we got served relatively quickly.  I do appreciate that they were even open on Christmas day, which most of the restaurants around were not."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience tonight at Panda Express in Buckeye, az. we were in the Drive-Thru no joke for 40 minutes and no way to back back out because there were cars behind us. So my husband went in to try to place our order and they wouldn't let him place it because we were already in the drive thru then when we got to the window the little girls thought it would be funny to talk s*** amongst each other worst service we have ever had at a fast food restaurant. oh and when we finally got to the speaker the little girl didn't even know what she was supposed to say like welcome to Panda Express all she said was can I take your order. so I had to remind her where she worked and helped her say welcome to Panda Express how may I help you"}
{"text":"So I just have to commend one of your managers on exemplary service. We just ate at your restaurant and not only was the staff amazingly friendly, the food was fresh and brought to our table for us. The entire experience was just very enjoyable and what topped it off was your on floor manager DJ. He was doing leg work for the restaurant and leading by example, as well as engaging with the customers. When we were leaving he made it a point to ask us how everything was and even remembered and addressed me by name. This guy belongs in your corporate staff. Don't let him go. Keep up the good \"wok\" DJ and crew."}
{"text":"I eat here often; the service is friendly and fast, even when there are long lines. The food is always good; I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"first off panda express isn't my favorite but my wife and daughter love it. so we stopped here on our way home from Phoenix and they screwed up the order. everytime I would say something she would ask what I said, never had this happen, don't know if she was half deaf or something else, even after I had to repeat everything she still screwed it up and I wasn't about to turn around on the 10fwy on my way to cali."}
{"text":"This panda express's staff is rude and unhelpful.. I will never return to this one.. I can not wait for the one to open at the 303 and waddell... Do yourself a favor and drive to a farther panda"}
{"text":"It's Asian fast food. Nothing too fancy. Nothing too exciting.   My little boy likes the Panda pictures all over the walls and their noodles. Sure there are healthier options all around, but sometimes this just sounds good and is not so bad every once in a while."}
{"text":"Molly seemed to have a heart attack when I simply asked to have my food put into a to go box. I guess she's paying for the bowls. The cook was nice which is the only reason they don't rate one star. Why have her in the front if she sucks at customer service?"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for for fast food but geez the drive thru at this place is like run by idiots. They have no sense of stream lining the experience and you wait close to 10 minutes for a measly order."}
{"text":"Why is that most days I come on for lunch at noon time that you are out of teriyaki chicken? I don't know why you wouldn't start cooking more when it starts running low. I am in line and there is one breast left and they call out \"teriyaki chicken \" little late don't you think."}
{"text":"Vomit on a plate.  While I would never actually eat here - someone from work wanted to meet there for some odd reason.  I went along for the ride knowing it would give me some killer material.  The eggrolls taste a mix between dirty dishwater and a rawhide shell.  The next question - how do you mess up orange chicken if you are a chain.  All the ingredients are probably out of a bag.  It was oily and gross.    Way better options - this place will serve people who don't know any better - but at least I did my best to try and warn you."}
{"text":"WOW! The bathroom is a mess! The paper towel holder is broken and nearly fell on my me as I tried getting some towels. There is toilet paper laid out chaotically and no food was available. Ended up waiting about 10 mins for food to cook. Maybe it was just a bad night for them?"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited for 28 minutes in the drive thru, to end up with burned fried rice and REALLY small servings. Not to mention we paid extra $ for the steak side and it only had 2 pieces."}
{"text":"This location is probably the best one I've been to so far. They do their best with the lunch rush, and I never end up waiting more than 10 minutes during that time. The food is always fresh, and the staff is super friendly. This is my go to panda!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give it a 0. Who serves burnt food and give no silverware with a drivethru togo?"}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins for food 1 girl working. The other 2 girls left she said and will be back in 1 hour they had 2 guys cooking in the back 20 people  in line and 10 min waiting the other 2 girls showed back up and started giving everyone there order they forgot about me. Very bad Cust service."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times, and every time the service seems to remain the same. Not being greeted, rudely being demanded what I wanted, and overall just not feeling welcome. I understand, I also work in the food business, but when it isn't even busy and it's over-staffed, is there even a reason to not be nice to a paying customer?   I stopped in at Panda because I wanted to take advantage of the free entree item you received on the back of your previous Panda receipt. This was the closest location. I had to buy a plate (I normally purchase the bowl) in order to get the free entree, so I got the lo mein, Kung Pao chicken, and Beijing Beef, and for the free entree, beef and broccoli.   I was pleased with the amount of lo mein the lady scooped for me, but as for the beef, which is the more expensive and better part, I was hardly given any. This is a nod more towards the overall Panda Express company rather than this individual store. I believe for the price you are paying (about $8 for a plate) is way too much for the amount of food you get. Why call it a \"side\" when you get more of the side than the entree? However, I think the thing that got me the most was the fact that I was given substantially more broccoli than beef. I like broccoli, I like beef. But I ordered a meat entree not a salad. And it definitely was not just a coincidence. I saw the lady deliberately pick out the broccoli and scoop it into the container. In addition to that, the little container is so flipping small. How does Panda Express think their customers will feel when they have to pay $2 for 2 pieces of meat and 10 pieces of broccoli! Regardless of getting this item for \"free\", it's still sad to know that they are giving out this small of an entree to a paying customer.   I'm not sure if this particular location only has to-go orders, but I was never asked if my plate was for here or to go. My intention was getting the meal to-go, but when they assume that everything is take-out, I will expect napkins, a sealed container, and forks. No napkins, no utensils, and the lid of my plate was not on completely.   This was yet another disappointing experience, for service and the portions. The chicken and beef both tasted really good.   I'm not sure if I'd come back to this location, as something like this has happened before. As some other reviews have said, if you want to spend money, at least go to Pei Wei. The quality of the food is better and you'll get a bigger portion for your buck."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always fresh and the staff is always super friendly. The is a bit long sometimes but it's not their fault that their food is in high demand. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"After a couple hours of shopping at this mall with my father and husband, we grabbed a quick dinner at Panda. They served us food, we went to sit down and the mall security came up to us and said \"you need to clear the area\". We asked which area we could sit at to eat. He said \"al of it\". There were a lot of other people eating and he did not tell them to leave, Panda never told us we could not \"dine in\" - So - we told him how RUDE he was and had to sit outside at the little tables to eat our dinner. It was not very good, old food. No where to clean up, so we left everything there at the table and left. We can shop and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Make the trip to the one on Dobson & Rio Salado. Better quality, better taste, and you get more food. This one barley serves your anything and tases like it is a day old."}
{"text":"Not worth your time!! I was so excited for a Panda Express to finally come to Pittsburgh because I've always loved them when visiting other places... but now I'm just disappointed.   This was my third time getting food from this location, the first two times weren't great. The food was okay but the service wasn't good. I thought I'd give them another try since they only opened a few months ago. I placed an online order and when I got there they told me that the chicken and string beans I wanted wasn't available. Okay, no problem, so I picked the broccoli beef. When I brought it back to my office for my lunch, I was disgusted! The broccoli was basically raw, barely even cooked. Some goes for the chow mien, the noodles were undercooked and the cabbage was essentially raw.   There really is no excuse for such undercooked food! I definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"There was no fried rice, white rice, or chow mein. I was than told it would be a 10 minute wait. It's 6:00pm on a weekday, how do you not have a single thing ready to go? I usually love panda because it is clutch. I guess this location sucks and I should have listened to the previous reviews."}
{"text":"Drive thu takes forever. Sometimes it's okay. The food is okay, but not consistent.  I've had really tasty food, and then almost burnt ones.  Maybe it depends on who's working in the kitchen. Who knows? It's never the same. Bejing beef is my favorite."}
{"text":"There is nothing \"express\" about this Panda location. Be prepared to sit for 10, 20, even 30 minutes trapped in the drive through lane."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant on a weekday at about 1:30pm. I was greeted warmly by an employee named Cami.  It was my first time ever trying a Panda Express so Cami explained to me the sizes, what you got with each size and asked if I had any questions about the food.  She was very kind and friendly.  I chose to order a bigger portion to take some home for my husband to try as well.  I got mixed veggies (5 of 5 stars for this dish) for my side dish, mushroom chicken (4 of 5 stars for this dish. Not super flavorful but very low on calories which is good) and the five flavor shrimp (5 of 5 stars for this dish)for my entrees.  Cami explained that because the five flavor shrimp was a special item there was an additional charge and asked if I was ok with that before putting some on my To-go plate.  I also got an order of 3 cream cheese Rangoon with a side of sweet and sour sauce(2 of 5 stars for this dish.  The Rangoon were too crispy and it made eating them difficult.  There was very little cream cheese in them too.  The sauce was very good but since they were almost burnt I had a hard time enjoying any of this)  The environment was very clean and nice.  I rounded up my meal from $11 and change to an even $12 for the charity they were fundraising for. Management should be very proud to have Cami working for them.   She has excellent customer service skills.  All together the experience was very good but although I don't think, based on the value of the meal, that I will be frequenting this establishment for lunch, I will keep it as an option from time to time."}
{"text":"Food is great as always as with any Panda Express EXCEPT the fried rice. It tasted as if they cooked the white rice and didn't let it dry or cool down before they fried it. It basically tastes as if it was rushed because it was still grainy and had NO taste whatsoever. And the girl who rang me up at the register kinda lightweight threw my receipt at me rushing to get to the next person in line. And as always they never put any spoons out and you have to spend extra time asking for it."}
{"text":"Love this spot because everyone is always professional & sweet BUT they always get my tea bar order wrong... idk if the lady who was taking my order was new because I had to repeat my order 5x which built up a line. I asked if the matcha milk tea is the real matcha & not green tea & she said it was but turns out it was NOT. I asked for chia seeds on my strawberry lemonade & didn't get any. My coworker wanted jelly on his & got boba (he was on lunch so he took it to go). I waited 16 minutes for the drinks which was kind of annoying cause they normally have some premade. It's frustrating craving something in particular, paying for it, & not getting it correctly. In my pictures you see the milk tea & my chia seedless drink & the difference in time. I'm also a worker at the plaza so i come here often & get discount but I didn't this time :( lol."}
{"text":"Having the drive thru is super convenient, wait time is not bad either. The service was decent but the food isn't great. The flavor lacks in almost all the choices of entrees, the fried rice looked and tasted like the brown rice with soy sauce on top."}
{"text":"This is one of the best PANDA I've eaten no really it taste great... Great Customer Service and the food items are all tasty."}
{"text":"Ok so I am well aware that this isn't authentic Chinese food, it is the fast food version thereof. Knowing that I still like it, call it a guilty pleasure call it convenient, call it just slightly healthier than a Big Mac. That being said, this location had an issue when I was there. It was 11 AM, I think we can all agree that is lunchtime, an early lunch perhaps, but lunchtime nevertheless . They were out of many items, some items were running low, and no replenishment had been started, and other items were not hot. Because of the aforementioned convenience I will go back and give it another try. So I may update this review. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Ok let me qualify the high star rating. Is this the finest Chinese food ever created? No. But there are times when fast food is the order of the day and you want a change from the burger, fried chicken or taco option. That is were Panda Express comes in the food is fresh and if you order carefully (I don't), you can be relatively healthy. I should also mention the staff at this particular P.E. are quite nice and helpful. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Upon my arrival, the server Courtnee certainly exceeded my expections, ensuring all my plates were cooked to high standards while managing to check me out in a timely manner. I can tell the manager at this location certainly puts in the time to develop his employees, ensuring that each customer is provided with phenomenal standards & great tasting food."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express! This was my first, and last, meal on a recent trip to Vegas. The first time I got the fried rice and orange chicken bowl and it was really good. The chicken was crispy and sweet. Their chili sauce is good too, tastes kind of like Sriracha!  The second time I got fried rice and sweet fire chicken, which was mostly sweet, but if you add the chili sauce it tastes even better.  The server didn't give me as much chicken as my other friend so I told the manager and he gave me extra :)  The fried rice was good, and garlicky, just the way I like it.  Great food at a great price (I got the bowl for around $7, and it was very filling), which is much appreciated especially after spending so much in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is your typical Panda Express. Nothing extra fancy and the food isn't the best but occasionally you will have a craving for it (as I do with the orange chicken). The staff was nice enough and greeted patrons as they entered. They also asked if I wanted to try any samples before I made my order which was considerate.  The only beef I have with this location is the taste of their fountain drinks. I swear I could taste orange sauce/that Panda taste (you know what I'm talking about) inside my Mug root beer. I'll still come back but that was a bit concerning. Hopefully they get their syrup to soda water ratio corrected by next time."}
{"text":"Poor service, very little of the entree (all rice and noodles) and the soda machine had a nasty chlorine taste (time to change water filters?) - yuck"}
{"text":"If you don't feel like cooking, want something faster than delivery, not in the mood for Burgers, fried chicken, or Mexican food, and don't want to go inside a restaurant, Panda Express is where it's At!!! I appreciate the fact that this is a drive-thru. It a great option when you do not feel like taking your baby our of their car seat one MORE time just to pick up dinner. I do prefer my local Chinese food spot and do not frequent Panda, but on the rare occasion I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of their ingredients. During this visit, we ordered the Angus Beef and Black Pepper Chicken, along with Chow Mein and Fried Rice. Everything was pretty good. My only complaint was the over usage of celery. It was a Celery explosion in all items, but they were not using it short you on meat. If there is ever another day where I wish to remain in my PJ's all day and everyone in the house is hungry NOW, Panda Express will remain on my list of Go-To's"}
{"text":"It really disappoints me that I have to give them a one star today. When we've come in here at night before a movie, they've always been really great. The food is always fresh, service is quick and the manager is super cool. We had a twenty minute lunch window from school. They open at 10 so we were there a few minutes before that. There was an employee rolling in right at 10 (appeared to be one of the cooks). We walked in and there wasn't a single item of food ready! After about 25 minutes, we received our food. Yes, there were about 9-10 of us but the woman at the register, Antonia, seemed to be a little flustered that they couldn't keep our individual orders straight. We arranged/grouped our own orders the way they should've been paid for and she shook her head in frustration, like it was our fault they couldn't get it right. Just a word of advice from a customer that has worked many years in a customer service/retail roll....DON'T EVER....EVERRRR SHAKE YOUR HEAD IN FRUSTRATION OR ROLL YOUR EYES IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMER THAT PAYS FOR YOU TO WORK WHERE YOU DO!!!! We notice all types of service, good and bad. Also, maybe the manager should have a meeting with his employees about promptness, if they open at 10...the food should be ready by 10."}
{"text":"\"RUDE and OLD FOOD\"!  I called back and spoke to the manager after getting my food home in 5 minutes and the soft noodles were hard,old and had sweat dots on it! I spoke to \"Daniel\" who said that he would replace my order on the next time that I come in. I gave him my information on August 22,2015. My early lunch was ruined because they opened at 10am and I placed my order at 10:15am and the food looked as if it had been refrigerated and dried out the night before. Not freshly cooked at all. My order was to be replaced at any time so I returned today at 12pm, 1 week later and the manager Daniel, lied right to my face! 1st he said that he never talked to me. When I showed him my order form with his name on it he said that he was Daniel but he already replaced my order yesterday when the complaint was made. I told him that he has a mix-up with complaints because mine was last week not yesterday. He told me,\"NO!..I won't do anything for you because I replaced your meal yesterday when you brought your food back to me with a complaint\"! He then turned around, walked away and left me standing there! I immediately called Corporate to report the incident in which they are sending me a $10 voucher to replace my meal at a local Panda. Because of the rude and insulting way that I was treated by the staff, I won't ever patronize this location again,even though it's just 5 minutes away. I should've listened to my friends who warned me about this locations food and service that they've experienced previously. Never again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy panda express. Almost every time I go I try something different. This panda express had very friendly employees and it was very clean during our visit. Really enjoy the Kung pow chicken. We will definitely be back!! Food was hot as well"}
{"text":"I dunt know, i liked it. Hardly best Chinese i had by a long mile, but something that you get at the fast food setting and comes out of the tray... You know - It was not bad. There was some flavor. And it was not grease, which is huge with me. Good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great place for fast Chinese food. Love their Chow Mein and Orange Chicken.  I see the staff always cleaning the tables and floors. Plenty of sitting and ample parking. In and out in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and the amount of food you get is not consistent. I love the noodles, orange chicken and beef with broccoli. This place does satisfy my craving for chinese food."}
{"text":"Guess I will add my review to the other 1-star accounts of this horrid place. However, I'm sure nothing will change because this place has been getting consistent complaints for years with no change or acknowledgment by management. They are always out of food at peak hours leaving many customers standing waiting for fresh food.  Of course, they always try to offer remnants of the afternoons dishes that are all crusted over and dry. Staff is far from interested in customer service and is usually seen standing around. The other Panda Express locations don't seem to have this problem. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Great food. Super clean. Better than any other Chinese in town. It's all fresh and they cook it in front of you. Idk why it's only 3 stars. And I can't believe this is my first time coming here"}
{"text":"Never got my food! Hard to believe since it is cafeteria style ordering, but when they are out of what you want it can happen. They said 3 minutes for mixed veggies and 3 minutes for teriyaki grilled chicken.  Cashier wanted to charge me for nothing and I said I'll wait to pay when I get my food.  They never let me know after 20 minutes and the rest of my group was done we left.  Thank goodness I didn't pay before hand."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's behind all the negative reviews - personal vendettas and politics at play, I suppose. My 4-Star review is a reflection of how this place compares to other fast-food / take out Chinese joints around the same price point. Is it gourmet? Of course not - but why in the world would you expect it to be? It's a good product at a reasonable price. The quality and temperature of the food was on point. I will agree that service was a bit slow, but the staff was very friendly. Based on the food and experience alone - and after reading some of the other angry reviews, not taking into account that your super-awesome favorite independent Chinese takeout place in the same plaza is like totally the best Chinese food ever and that you've been going there for like a million years and that chains are the devil - you could do a whole lot worse for your money. Faint praise? Maybe, but I'd be happy to go back. Evaluated fairly without bias or ulterior motives, it's a solid fast food option."}
{"text":"Ugh. They did it AGAIN. There's only 1 word that comes to mind INCOMPETENT. In the last month I've stopped at this location on my way home from work, and both times they screwed up my order! I don't know what is going on at this location but ITS NOT GOOD. Last time they had me waiting in my car for potstickers and forgot about me. Get it together, guys. Like we don't have enough aggravation in our lives...."}
{"text":"To the lady that rang all of my party in this Chinese fast food establishment, please learn some manners. Seriously? Just trying to get some Chinese food here. I don't recall ordering a side of attitude.  Oh, and the prices are jacked up by like $3-4. Yeah yeah, I know this is located on the Strip and all, but holy cow, is it even worth it?  According to my drunchies, yes. Yes, it is.  Otherwise, you should try going to a finer Chinese food spot in one of the casinos."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Food dried out and employees with attitude!! Would not recommend this to anyone. Please stay away."}
{"text":"Food wasn't fresh. Was room temp. Rice was clumpy. Staff was unpleasant. This place used to be great. I dont know whats going on there."}
{"text":"Foods alright but real rough customer service. Don't bother going past 8:30; they're still open but the employees are done working. I went in and the person at the drive through window told me there's only 2 entrees left, nothing else no sides etc. So I order one f the two items and she says there's only enough for a small. They aren't kidding when they say small. Why not close if you're not going to make food past 8:30? I called and they said they make things cooked to order past 8:30 and I asked why that option wasn't offered to me, the girl got lippy with me and made some excuse about it taking 10 minutes. Clearly she just didn't wanna lift a finger and neither did the other 5 employees sitting on their phone in the dining room waiting to close. Definitely skip this place in the evenings, Piada and Chipotle are a parking lot away."}
{"text":"I came here with my large family and had a decent meal at a decent price.  Everyone was satisfied with their entrées and no one complained about anything. That's rare because we have a large family.  I prefer this panda express to other Asian fusion restaurant because you can see it first the food looks, and service is always dependable. I don't need the hype, I just need good food."}
{"text":"Was anxious to try panda express,  it was a let down.  Could just be personal experience and biased opinion but they're are MUCH MUCH better Chinese food restaurants located in the city and worth the drive!  Surprisingly not that much of a selection but we tried a variety of items.    The food was all cold sadly to say -  the fried rice wasn't fried haha...The egg roll was so overdone the edges were black! But the inside was tasty lol.  The teriyaki chicken was basically gelatinous strips of chicken fat covered in a mild ( almost non existent sauce).  The orange chicken was delicious!!  And tasted absolutely nothing like orange chicken lol.  Our beef and broccoli consisted on 3 pieces of broccoli and 2 squares of beef...  About the size of a quarter.  And the chow main was....  Just okay.  Taste was there but kinda dry.   But like I said...  That's just personal opinion.  Take it or leave it.   Most likely we will not come back."}
{"text":"Based on my past three visits it's just one of the worst branch. Terrible taste in compare to many other Panda Express branches. Always out to items. Service wise I don't really care because it is a fast food chain but need a lot of improvements from quality of the food to more availability. Not sure about how clean they are which other can speak for it.   Bottom line  Food Quality: dry, badly cooked food, mostly out of stock items."}
{"text":"This place is okay, but there are better places out there.  I went through the drive through yesterday as soon as they opened. They person on the speaker was very nice and kind and shockingly not hard to understand. We all know those speakers suck. I paid, cash and as soon as I did my meal was ready. One thing I didn't like was how the lady who handed me my food leaned out of the window like she was trying to get really close to me...she gave me a creepy/rapey smile."}
{"text":"Panda fills my need quickly. It has been my Top choice for fast food."}
{"text":"The food sucks and so does the service beware of the old Asian lady Linda she is the worst! Super attitude and can barely even speak! Avoid this place at all costs it's not worth your money or disappointment! Just say no"}
{"text":"Would say this is some of the worst service I have ever had regarding Panda Express in general, employees payed little to no attention to the order process, continually looking over to their co workers and laughing at a girl that was walking by, the guys were eyeballing a girl who was in front of the store as if she was a piece of meat, couldn't even order my food in peace, food was basic, same as always, nothing special, when I asked for a mandarin sauce they gave me so little that I kid you not I could barely put it over a few pieces of the chicken."}
{"text":"Skimpy sides and main entree, scanned my card twice, Renee M. Was the lady who \"fulfilled\" my order   Train your staff better to give better portion sizes as we are all paying the same price and each person should roughly get the same amount of food each time, highly dissatisfied with the service"}
{"text":"This place is always clean i love getting food from panda express .dine in or drive thru worth it."}
{"text":"I just came about 5' ago ,i am very disappointed about how they service .The vietnamese lady her name is SELENA ,i am vietnamese employee too but i never  do that to my customers .The way she service is the worst in the world.Hey Selena i wanna tell u if u dont like your job just quit .shittt u can not do that to the customer .I could call the manager tell about but i dont do that .I love panda food but the way she does that Panda is losing all the customers :) dear"}
{"text":"they just took the order,scooped it into a styrofoam container & took my $$-they smiled & got it right -not much more to it not \"real\" chinese but always consistent. beef was crispy and chicken was too-really orangey compared to previous visits. food is always hot & fresh. never disappointed but really just fast food chinese"}
{"text":"Always Fast & friendly. Still the same standard issue fast food chinese with my favorites being the orange chicken & crispy beef add a little rice & noodles some wontons and Im good to go. Always a check option to the drive-thru. But remember you will be hungry in an hour."}
{"text":"Another fast food place located in the food court a Meadows Mall. My kid like this place so I let him give it a go.   To me everything looks dried out & very pastey sauces.   They no longer have crispy beef and the other stuff just looks weird so my son chose ORANGE Chicken w/ half noodles half rice.  Whats up with the Fried rice w/NO pork? Yuk!   I'm NOT a fan I'd rather go to Pick Up Stix at least its made to order."}
{"text":"This was the worst fast food experience I have ever had .I started ordering  she tells me she's out of three different items then I go to order the teriyaki chicken and everything seems fine . When the lady at the window finally hands me my food there was no teriyaki sauce in the bag so I asked her if she can get me some and she seemed to get upset that I asked and says they don't have anymore, well I asked her how long will it be before you have the sauce because what's the point of the teriyaki in the first place you should've told me you didn't have the sauce What am I supposed to do with this dry chicken! I hear employees in the background telling them just to say they're not gonna have the sauce for the rest the night  like I couldn't hear . So when she comes back to the window she says it'll like a 10 minute wait. These people don't know how to do their jobs and what's worse is they don't even try to. Very unprofessional will not be returning"}
{"text":"OK, I don't consider Panda to be authentic Asian. I don't consider Taco Bell Mexican food either, but sometimes, I like to indulge in both. I used to be a frequent visitor of Panda but kinda cut back just due to trying to eat healthier. But I found myself stopping in at this location the other day and was please that they started offering steamed veggies instead of rice, even though they are probably drowning in butter, I was glad that they had some other option. I think they have always had the veggies, but it counted as an item, not a side. I may be wrong on both either way, Orange chicken = Crazy Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best panda I've ever been to they are always so nice and pleasant. I've never had a problem here and they give me bigger portions than the other ones I have gone too.  I always mix up what I get from here.   I really miss the sesame chicken they had. I hope they bring it back soon  The place is always clean and neat"}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS...I would give it 0 stars if possible. I came here after craving Panda Express for a couple days. I get to the store to find out there out out of everything.  The the only entree they had was orange chicken. They told me it would be 15 minutes before anything else could be ready. There was no one preparing food and the workers seemed irritated when I asked if something could be made. I swallowed my pride and got the orange chicken. Come home to hard rice and cold chicken. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"They should have kept the Paradise Cafe menus. Bad food and overpriced. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Arrived at Panda Express around 6:30pm, dinner time. Thinking it was going to be busy and hectic, the employees at the front, Nick, Roy, Daniel were INCREDIBLY NICE. Even though they were busy, they still greeted every customer and made sure they got the correct order for everyone. The fried rice was still cooking but they kept making sure the customers waiting for the rice were still doing okay. First time at this location and first time ever receiving this kind of service from any Panda Express employees. Thank you for making our visit worth while! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to give this place a chance but 3 times now we have had to wait for over 20 minutes only to find out they haven't even started the green beans and chicken which was only one of the items we ordered so now the rest of our food is cold.  Wow.  Then the entree was done but we had to tell them we were still waiting for it.  Hmmmm gave a one because you have to."}
{"text":"I have a medical condition which basically means I cannot eat meat. This is the only Panda Express location I have found in Las Vegas that even offers Eggplant Tofu, and so I stop in often as it's one of the few places I can go. I wish more locations had it (I've never found a location in Orange County or San Diego County that has it either) but that's why I'm not upset. I've never had an issue here until now.  I visited this location on the 17th and it was only just a few minutes after 8:30. I looked it up before I went and saw they closed at 10pm so I knew I had time to dine in. They had another dish in the place of where they usually have the Eggplant Tofu but that was no problem, sometimes they have to make it up for me and that's okay, I never mind waiting. So I let the lady know that I would like that dish and she refused, telling me they won't make it, I could only get what's on the steam table. When I explained that don't mind waiting, she told me they no longer have it, they did away with it. I asked when, she told me few weeks ago (Which could be, I was out of town for spring break). I pointed at that it was still on the magnet on the steam table and on the menu board. \"They haven't removed them yet\". While that's possible, that upset me because there are no other dishes that don't have meat. I would have left if the other members of my party hadn't already ordered.  So I ordered half brown rice and half steam veggies, and went to attempt to make this work. I wanted also get one of the two items as steam veggies as well (since there aren't any other choices for me) but again, she refused to make me any more. I attempted to explain my reasons for asking for just items with veggies but she told me kitchen was closing and they wouldn't make any more food. This was an hour and a half before closing. I get it if I came in at closing but come on. And did she seriously think that what was on the table would last until closing? Of course while dining in, they were still serving food out of the kitchen. At this point, I asked who was the person in charge because of her careless attitude, I didn't want to even have to take it that far but she told me no one was in charge that was on, there was no one I can speak to. Basically, I had to pick two more dishes that I didn't even want and just eat the few veggies that were in it (The rest of my party enjoyed the meat I gave up since it was most of my dishes anyway, and they offered what little veggies they had in theirs but it shouldn't have had to been that way).  This is by far the worst experience I've ever had at a Panda Express and if it is true they did away with the only dish I could actually eat here, I guess there is no point in me coming back anyway. While I understand others do not have the limitations I do, and therefore wouldn't have the issues I did, the service here was still horrible. I'd find another location where they are actually friendly. I normally go during the day shift I guess, and have never had an issue with the staff being so rude. So if you go to this location, I guess earlier in the day is the best time to go. These are just my opinions and mine alone. Take it as you will.  Update; They did reach out to me and offered to pay for my meal, which I believe to be fair. I have also since gone back to this location and found they do in fact still offer the Egg Plant Tofu, which is awesome. I still haven't found another store that offers it and contacting them, they couldn't advise any stores that do offer too but I have one store that still offers it so I cannot complain. Upon returning, I didn't see the employee that was treating us poorly but I hope she just got whatever was going on in her life worked out. I do still enjoy Panda Express and just wish more stores offered at least the one meatless dish."}
{"text":"Never mix Johnnie Walker with Panda Express = NO BUENO. I ordered the fried rice and orange flavor chicken followed up with a brisk rasberry ice tea. Normally I would enjoy that mix but not this time. I took four bites, pushed my tray forward, then passed out as if I was back in my stats class in college. All while: Eugine Y, Johnny G, Reid Y were taking pics of me.  Never again shall I eat this while intoxicated."}
{"text":"This location is incredibly unprofessional. The employees at the drive through are unprofessional, flat-out rude, and always act like they couldn't care less. I've never had such bad service as I get at this Panda Express. sit at the window for a good minute or two before they even open it to say anything. I waited for my entree to be cooked for 35 minutes because their cook \"went to walmart\" in the middle of his shift. My entree is usually undercooked and the noodles are crunchy, like they've been sitting out for hours. My recommendation is to take your money anywhere else."}
{"text":"Meine Kinder lieben Panda Express. Ich selbst bin nicht sooo begeistert davon, weil ich immer denke, dass wir asiatisches Essen zuhause (in Deutschland) viel besser bekommen.  Heute Abend war es wieder so weit: ich musste mich der mehrheitlichen Entscheidung beugen und wir gingen zu Panda. Es ist natürlich sehr günstig und man hat schnell was zu sich genommen. Aber für mich persönlich ist da zu wenig Geschmack im Essen. Außerdem mag ich es nicht so, wenn die Speisen schon länger dort in der Vitrine liegen.   Zu dieser Filiale muss ich allerdings positiv erwähnen, dass mir die Einrichtung sehr gut gefallen hat. Entweder wurde neu renoviert oder sie war noch nicht alt. Jedenfalls gefällt mir dieser neue Style sehr gut, ein Kompliment an die Innenarchitekten! Das Essen schmeckt wie überall bei Panda Express. Um schnell etwas zu essen, ist es in jedem Fall gut geeignet."}
{"text":"The food is as good as any other Panda,but their service is a bit rude and rushed and uninformative.Also they dont have some of the good dishes that are available in California(I am from there)."}
{"text":"This review is not specific to this Panda store. It is Panda in general. Do you think we do not realize you just changed take out containers and we are now paying the same price for less food. It is at least a quarter less. The new containers DO NOT stay closed and they leak all over in the bag on the way home. We are going to be done getting Panda take out. I cannot have food leaked all over in my car. It is bad enough that you are trying to cheat by making the container smaller and thinking the pay public is too stupid to notice."}
{"text":"After waiting ten minutes for the orange chicken I was then told I would have to wait for extra sauce on my teriyaki chicken while they made more when there was clearly sauce in the bowl on display. So after waiting 20 minutes I finally got to sit and eat. Man it was the worst orange chicken I've ever had, the teriyaki chicken was average at best, and the egg roll tasted like my foot. For Christ sakes the fortune cookie tasted like cardboard. It angers me that Panda Express has even came to Pittsburgh there's already plenty of horrendous new chain restaurants popping up around town and Panda Express adds to it. Safe to say I'll never be back. I'm sorry to hear that people actually enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Food here is always good and prepared correctly. The drive thru staff isn't very friendly."}
{"text":"I normally don't write review on Fast Food but I have to do it today!  Came here for a Togo lunch box and they don't have my favorite dish - egg plant tofu. I was having hard time to select what items I want and the team, Shiela, Deja's and Marie (?) offered me they can cook fresh right away. I was not sure if I want to wait and they told me they will do it and it will be 7 mind wait.  I said okay... and they even offered me a cup and told me to get a drink while waiting. I said no need and they insisted I should sit down and have something to drink while waiting. Have to give the TEAM a big applause and Thank you!  Nowadays in this town we seldom see such a good Customer Service, especially in a fast food. Panda Express - no wonder why you are successful. Lol... Keep this up Team!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly, they offered me fresh chow mein when they ran low instead of just tossing the rest in. While I waited I was given a water cup just cause I was waiting. They were a very friendly staff. It's the night shift on 1 July. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Parking is tight in this area and this place is especially busy during dinner time but I'm usually in and out.   So I went in Panda the other day for dinner. The customer service by the two young ladies in there was superb. They offered samples and assisted with menu election.   Since I was waiting for fresh chow mein they offered me a free drink and just tried to make me feel comfortable while waiting. When my food was ready they bagged it up and gave me all the condiments I asked for. The service really stood out this trip. Thanks girls, keep it up.   I ordered the 2 item combo with chow mein, and grilled chicken teriyaki - my fave, along with their famous orange chicken. Yummy when hot!   I'm not too thrilled eating food that has been sitting for sometime so I don't mind waiting to have fresh food prepared."}
{"text":"Well the food is good, however the service sucks! Three times I've been there, once ordered ahead, waited over 20 minutes regardless. All three times my order was shorted an item and when I called about it the manager didn't care and didn't offer to make it right. This will be the last time I eat there."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love Panda Express. I ordered from this location at 11:05am. It is currently 11:54 am and I still haven't received my food :/ kind of disappointing.    But food is now here, Uber driver stated panda lost communication w Uber and someone came in and took the food. I ordered half chow mein half rice, the rice was hard and the orange chicken was nearly burnt it tasted like . The cream cheese ragoons I ordered were really good though! I'm just really disappointed with the fact panda didn't know the difference between real Uber and a fake Uber. Had to wait almost an hour to just receive my food . I love panda but I'm not sure if I'll order from here again"}
{"text":"Another mediocre experience at this location.  Food was low, they were stacking orders for waiting on Orange Chicken. The employee \"Aman\" was flippant with the customer before me, and I had to ask her to refresh the fried rice for my order as mine had been cooling in the stack for some time. She complied, but seemed put out. The employee \"Omar\" was helpful.  No one was smiling, no one was greeting, just flat business attitudes.  I get the feeling that the flat attitudes come from the management level, as there is no joy in the place. Dear management, please lead!  Thankfully the Orange Chicken was fresh ( because we waited )."}
{"text":"I've come here numerous times with my boyfriend and kids and I am very disappointed every time. The inside is always gross and never clean, the food line looks like someone had a food fight. Everyone is always yelling at the little manager lady and she just takes it and apologizes. Everyone is always yelling at each other and it makes me uncomfortable. I've never been to a fast food place that is so angry and disgusting. I hope a health inspector visits them soon. Seriously."}
{"text":"Always salty and over seasoned.  However it's expected.  The lighter fair such as chicken and broccoli are not bad.  Fast food.  Can't hide it.  But if you accepted it's okay and probably a good choice if you don't want a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I am in love with their orange chicken bit talk about a ripoff! The person in front of me in line got a double order of orange chicken like me but after his there was hardly any left - I figured she's grab'n a new bowl but nope! Scraped the bottom of the barrel & I didn't get nearly what the order normally is- so I asked the manager - he's just as useless so I leave - Not retuning to this greedy location!"}
{"text":"This place is just awful -bad service bad food bad location - just awful. I give them credit for trying but they don't speak great English (got my order wrong twice due to lack of communication) won't be going back here any time soon"}
{"text":"Food can be pretty good at times. Drive thru almost always messes up your order. It closes at 10:30pm according to their site but they always close an hour early. Tf?. If you get there late they always run out of chow mein, orange chicken, and all kinds of other entrees/sides. Customer service is not good, everybody's mad that they are working there for some reason."}
{"text":"First experience - didn't have noodles, when noodles where ready, didn't have orange chicken, when that was ready didn't have beef and broccoli. Over all I waited 20 minutes to get a \"free drink\"   Gave them a second chance - as soon as they said wait for orange chicken I walked out.   Panda management: your response to negative reviews are always the same. Don't just apologize, provide steps you are taking to correct the issue.   Apparently your store is the worst rated in Tempe. This reflects on your leadership. Change your manager and team leads."}
{"text":"I would never come back to this location, every time I come,I encounter myself to be served by JAY, the manager. He reduces the portion of food to the point that you barely get food on your plate. I had to laugh and go, leaving my food on the counter. It's not the first time it has happened to me. He has to learn what is the right portion of food to be served. I don't want anything extra for free, I just want what I usually get at Panda. He has no idea of customer service and when you talk to him he just  reply with a sarcastic smile. It happened today, 8/28/2017 at 2:50 pm. Due to the inconvenience I had to drive all the way to Fashion Show Mall to have Panda at the food Court. Not a happy customer"}
{"text":"I created this panda on yelp due to I'm a big yelper and to let people know this panda is a hit or miss. All depends on the chief in the kitchen, also if they are busy or not. If they have a good chief and are busy your food with be very hot tasty and fresh. Other times not so much even with busy n bad chief. They do accept military and police discount witch is nice since a lot of places in the Mesa area of river view don't."}
{"text":"This Panda Express service is really bad, very small portions! I ordered a bowl of noodles, she only served not even half the bowl! Can be finished within two bites! I came from NJ, the portion is so larger than here, I even cannot finish one bowl in NJ. Don't come to this Panda Express!"}
{"text":"I picked the wrong time and day to come today I been in line for about 30 min now ugh"}
{"text":"Every once in a blue moon you want to gorge yourself in greasy Chinese food. Although I drive on LVB daily, Panda Express somehow really caught my eye on my drive home the other day.  Panda Express is located right in the same complex of the South Outlets on Las Vegas Blvd. The inside is surprisingly spacious, open, and clean. I walked in craving noodles and chicken and ordered just that. I was lucky to catch the cook making a fresh batch of Chow Mein and tried a few chicken pieces to figure out which chicken I wanted. I went with the grilled Teriyaki Chicken which was pretty decent!  I was pleased by the friendly workers - a male who helped get my to-go bowl together and a female who assisted me at the register. They were both welcoming and engaging.  The food tasted OK - met my expectations for Panda Express. I added a few extra ingredients when I got home to give it a bit more flavor (soy sauce, black pepper, topped off with Sriracha).  - 5/5 for the service  - 3/5 for the food  - Overall 3/5 as the food is so average   Not a bad location for quick Americanized Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Panda Express I have ever been to. Didn't put me enough chicken or rice. Box was half empty. Plus the girl was very rude. She didn't ask me how my day was or anything. She even forgot to ask me if I wanted a drink. Felt very unwanted. Needs new management."}
{"text":"Their food leaves something to be desired. Their chicken and mushrooms had no flavor today. Employees are not the friendliest either. I'll stick to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Before I forget I wanted to day this is by far the best experience of great portions and customer service.  I couldn't even finish usual portions can vary from location to location this place was serving everybody great portions.    To bad I live in Peoria and was just out this way for work and grabbing lunch  thanks panda at university and Gilbert rd"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch and tell the guy behind the counter ( Frank ) that you want your order in a to-go box. And he still give you a plate. Then you tell him what you want and he proceeded to give you the wrong stuff. When you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change. Doesn't offer and soy sauce or anything else.  Humm.. I don't think it take a masters degree to listen or give descent customer service."}
{"text":"UPDATED  After a few months hiatus from this place, decided to give them another chance. What a mistake! Never go to this disgusting location.   Again they were out of soy sauce!!!!!  Then my kid found 3 hairs in his food!  Threw our food away. Making a complaint with corporate.  Very dissatisfied with this location today. I came for lunch at 11:15am and they are not prepared for business! They are out of everything. It looks like they are serving left overs from the previous day's business!   My food was not warm. They scraped the bottom of the pan for my sweet and sour sauce.   There wasn't anyone else in the dining room.   Me and my kids were disappointed in today's visit. I will start going to another location.   If you want fresh food from this location go at least an hour after they open."}
{"text":"Ordered a two-entry plate. One item was cold. They gave me a fresh one but tasted burned. And to top it off my fortune cookie had no fortune. :("}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this location and didn't have the best experience. My boyfriend and I ordered the bowls, chow mein and orange chicken when i get to the cashier i notice that his bowl only had like 4 little pieces of orange chicken and I nicely asked the guy can i please get a little more chicken on my boyfriend bowl. He right away said No, that all we are allowed to serve! I got a bit upset and laughed and said that's not even a side, its 4 pieces. He then said I can give you another side but it will cost you I said fine IDC if you charge me I just want more chicken. He then smirked and went to go grab the side and was whispering to the girl that was on the line about what was going on and the girl rolled her eyes! which made me super upset i just paid and walked away. The cashier guy customer service was horrible and the portions SUPER small. I probably will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"My husband likes Panda Express and we've been to this one a few times.  It's not real Chinese food and really caters towards the American taste, which is fine because that's what they do.  One time, I remember, it was a Chinese woman behind the counter and boy, what an attitude.  I think if I were white, she'd have treated me better.  Maybe Asians with their own kind, they feel they can give poor customer service to because we're willing to take it, but since there are plenty of other places to eat at, especially Panda's, it's not a good idea to treat your Asian clientele like crap.  The food is the same from one Panda to another and usually we get good service.  I've noticed if it's a Hispanic person, the service is awesome.  If' it's an Asian person, it's up for grabs.  And so so with a white person.  Bad services at places where there a lot of, we're usually more inclined to stop doing business."}
{"text":"My son just begged and begged from some orange chicken today with steamed rice. I on the other hand could go for some spring rolls so I went to pick some up. The drive thru was quick and the employees were friendly. This location is just off to me. The food always taste like it's been sitting forever. My spring rolls were just ok and the sauce for them was so thick and cold it wasn't pleasant at all.,I didn't even eat a whole one.,I'll stick to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"The food taste like it's been sitting for a couple of hours. I couldn't even finish my meal, since some of the orange chicken was hard. Pandas express has gone down as a chain, worse Chinese food ever. Most of the selections were not even cooked because how slow this place is now."}
{"text":"Filthy dining area 14 available tables and all we're dirty. Floor was sticky by soda dispenser and trash all over the counter. Food was average. BAD place!"}
{"text":"My first impression was not so good. The bathrooms were locked for cleaning, the food was sparse and not fresh, and the staff didn't even say hello like usual Panda fashion. And, after they eventually opened the restrooms - they didn't even look clean. But I opted to try out the food since I was seriously ready for some Chinese food. I made a comment about the food not looking so fresh and they cooked everything that my boyfriend and I ordered on the spot for us. My faith was restored. The noodles were particularly tasty, even moreso than other Panda locations."}
{"text":"Great chinese. First time I ever had it. I was in LV for the first time, needed a quick meal, and trying to stick to my mantra of never trying anything twice, I went here, even though this is avaliable in my hometown of Wheaton, IL. Thank you, Panda."}
{"text":"This place perfectly encompasses why minimum wage should stay $9, it is always frustratingly slow the staff has zero hustle. Rude staff, cold food, dirty floors; all things you get to look forward to when eating at this establishment. They didn't even have clean dine in trays at the counter. Go to Red China Cafe down the street it's 100x times better."}
{"text":"I stopped by last week for the free Tangy Jumbo Shrimp with an internet coupon.  The restaurant was located in the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas.  I got 3 shrimp with the tails on mixed with red bell peppers and green beans.  I would not pay for the Tangy Jumbo Shrimp."}
{"text":"This location needs some training on customer service and food preparation. The manager treats it like a play area and doesn't really care about quality of service or quality of food just get them in and get them out. Do yourself a favor and drive to Arizona and Ocatillo for a better experience.  Fresh food and employees really seem to care about their location."}
{"text":"Not sure why I was charged $1.50 extra for the bowl but besides that, it was great! This is one of the very few Las Vegas cheapeats. Open late which is a big plus and average priced for the eatery on the strip."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me! I order. 3 item entree and guess how many I got, 2. How hard is it to read the ticket and count the items. Guess this is another Panda to add to the list of Panda expresses I won't ever go back to. I would go back but only get so much time for lunch. I trusted them to do their jobs and complete an order correctly never gonna do that again."}
{"text":"I always go to this Panda Express! It's pretty good can't lie. The lines may be long, but trust me it will go by fast. Most of the time the food is pretty fresh! I been going for about 2 years now, still solid!"}
{"text":"My customer service started with the friendly drive thru attendant that greeted me. She was clear and spoke loud enough to be heard and understood. My order was ready even before the online pickup time. Overall, the employee was fast and courteous and the food was hot and delicious. Fantastic job!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service I recommend the orange chicken However I sometimes see that the staff can not translate English well so make sure to ellaborate on what your order is"}
{"text":"Not to happy we need a good Chinese food place out here. Maybe that's what it is. If you go you will feel like you wasted your money after you eat.  I guess it is what it is.  I hope we get some Asians out here to open up some businesses in some of these empty spaces that are all over. We need good food out here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst night crew they could possibly have. This is the closet panda to my house and if you go anytime after 7:30 then they are probably out of everything. Even though they close at 11pm. This is a common problem the last few times I have gone there.  I was told that orange chicken (the most popular dish) will be a 6 minutes wait. No big deal. Which was over a 30 minute wait. Very unprofessional. Rude staff. And once I went inside to wait. The staff was arguing very loud across the restaurant. Wouldn't recommend this store after 7:30pm. Early shift seems fantastic. The main cook seems to get easily pissed off."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of Panda Express, but this location lacks in some professional approach. Every time we have been into this location they have personal items strewn across a table by the drinking fountain, cold food and cold personality. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I would avoid this place if you want fast food chinese.  There are only a few dishes available, the rest you have to wait 5-7 minutes.  What food they have, they give you half size portions.  The lineup for everyone waiting was crazy.  Allow time when you go."}
{"text":"I wish there were negative stars on yelp, this is the worst location ever. Went in at 630pm on a Sunday and it was not very busy. Ordered a family meal and they didn't have several meats prepared. I was told it would take 10 mins if u wanted to wait. The girl who began to fill my order dropped the tongs in the floor and picked them up stuck them back in the chow mein. I told her that was a health safety violation she just smiled and kept filling orders..walked out. Do not eat at this location. This has been the third time i have been here with the same issues. Not again"}
{"text":"You want real Chinese food?  Go to China.  On second thought, that might be a little too exotic for the faint at heart.  In which case, what you want is the American version of Chinese food.  So if you find yourself at Red Rock on a Wednesday evening and stop hitting \"Repeat Bet\" long enough to realize you're hungry, a trip to the food court may be in order.  And that's when, faced with an array of less-than-exciting choices, you could decide to dig in to Panda Express's offerings.  Sure, you could pay a few more bucks and get the same - or better - quality Chinese food at the buffet, but then you'll pig out and hate yourself in the morning.  Or sooner.  While Panda is overpriced for what you get (Note:  most of the food court places seem to have raised their prices recently), you can choose to eat less of it.  I used to order the two-item combo plate, but it really was too much food for me, so I've switched to the bowl.  Last time I got a new item - Angus steak and shrimp - and it was actually pretty good, though I didn't notice that it was a buck extra because of the shrimp.  So that little bowl of food - with way too much rice, but enough of the main, was over $8 with the tax.   Still, it was a passable alternative to starvation, and the diversion actually saved me a few bucks at the machines."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. The staff was extremely professional and courteous to a very rude customer. I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"The service here is 3/10, the focus on processing online orders instead of the people physically in the store. In fact, they don't even acknowledge the people in line. I stood in line for 10 minutes and during that time they helped no one in the store but were processing orders. They never acknowledged anyone with a simple \"be right with you\". A few waiting customers left. They had plenty of staff but not efficient. Not sure I would return to this location."}
{"text":"I must have said easy on the chicken, portions should be weighed. Lady behind the counter has an attitude and if I'm spending 20$ for food I would like the portions to be consistent."}
{"text":"Lately the quality of service at Panda has definitely deminished. I've have been a customer for a long time. When I ask for my plate to be made the way I like it I've been argued with by the employees. Most of the meat is made with alot of vegetables. Therefore when they serve you with the small entree that they give you for meat it seems to always be filled with more vegetables then meat. When I request for them to try not to give me so much vegetables I'm told that I will have a smaller portion of food not more meat. I simply don't understand why you would rather argue with your customer then to satisfy them. Obviously this company has become so big that the quantity of food left in there trays is more important then the quality of service they are giving."}
{"text":"This is the only Panda in Vegas that I will eat at!   Food is always cooked PERFECTLY, never salty and never greasy. The customer service here is excellent, I come here pretty often and they always remember me and what I order.   I have been to the various Panda's on the strip (Las Vegas blvd.) and every time I went, I came home with food poisoning! Yes, food Poisoning; stomach aches and the runs for an entire day! I thought it was just that batch, but when I returned a second and third time, it was the same greasy food.   So please, if you are craving affordable Chinese food, come to the Panda on Sunset rd. your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Today was my daughter angelene's birthday and we were very busy with our crazy work schedule, so we decided that we just get the family over for a quick dinner celebration. We than decided that it's better if we just order some foods instead of cooking because we have no time. Anyway, we found out that Panda Express caters for party, but we don't need that much food for 11 people including kids. So we went with 2 family feast dinner and the staffs at that place was very good of getting our food out to us quick. I want to say thank you to the manager and staff that help us today."}
{"text":"Dan helped us there.  My office goes there all the time for lunch and they are always speedy, accurate and friendly.  They seemed to be trained consistantly and always offer an egg roll and medium drink.  The entrees are always warm and seem fresh."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed every time I go to this particular panda express in Avondale. They constantly have nothing prepared and if you order anything that's not prepared it always takes 10 minutes. What happened to express? Last time I was there was a year ago and I stopped going there because of the fact they run out of their dishes. I come back today and it's the same situation. Plus I ordered broccoli beef and they gave me eight pieces of broccoli and two beefs.  They need management supervision in that store."}
{"text":"Had to walk out. Bad customer service. I tried multiple times to be patient with  the two women in front. She kept loading my plate with things that I didn't ask for. Then got frustrated with me shoved my plate over to another woman who kept interrupting my order to give samples to other customers. I had to walk out. I only had 20 minutes for lunch on a 13 hour urgent care shift now I don't get food because of this. Thanks a lot will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better is right.  I used to like Panda but now the chow mien has a funny burnt taste to it and unless you eat the orange chicken nothing else is very good here.  I came here the other day because my son loves this place and I wanted to treat it to him...it was this place or McDonald's and that place is much worse.  I can at least have orange chicken and the place is really clean and the service is pretty good.  I don't want to talk bad but I just don't care for this chain any more, so sorry to the franchise owner."}
{"text":"Disappointed in cheap styrofoam container to hold my food (instead of a plate) when I'm dining in, not taking to go."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Was so happy they opened and I no longer have to drive to Columbus for some panda. I agree the noodles are dry-- but that's what makes them so good here! The manager (Camilo I believe?) was SO friendly and helpful when we had a small issue last week. He's amazing and will keep this place amazing!  Only complaint is the drive thru. It is tough that you are forced to wait even if you want to leave. Poor design, but not the foods fault."}
{"text":"Every time I come here this place never has any food ready and they're closing up and moping by 8pm! Every time! Pretty annoying when they don't close until 9:30pm. You would think they would be prepared and ready for the dinner rush, instead of trying to rush out and close! Pretty bad service"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to hear that this chain has been expanding out to the area. I have seen them around when travelling but never had a chance to eat at one until now. Think Chipotle style ordering but with choice of Chinese style entrees and sides. Guess what? They also have a drive thru.   I was not disappointed with my meal. The food was fresh and hot. Orange chicken and Broccoli Beef was tasty and not oily or salty. The side of fried rice and chicken egg roll was pretty good. I would eat here again.  This location recently opened up for business and I thought the staff was doing a good job at handling the lunch rush. The inside was clean and organized. I would come here for the speed and convenience of a quick meal."}
{"text":"Was road tripping to Zion National Park and got hungry.  Didn't want to burn time in the Strip so thought I would stop at the first \"healthy fast food\" place that I could find that wasn't too off the highway.  Google directed me to this location.  The food is pretty much what you would expect from a Panda Express.  Americanized Chinese food that is edible and will fill your stomach while on the road.  The reason for the 2 stars is the location, environment, cleanliness, and the general sense of not feeling safe.  I don't know much about North Las Vegas, but boy, this location was seedy and atrocious.  We sat outside at the metal tables due to us having our dog with us.  At least 5 homeless people walked near the restaurant or even into the restaurant.  Now, I can't really blame the restaurant for this, but it's something that potential patrons may want to know.  The restaurant itself reeked of urine and the bathroom was absolutely foul and disgusting.  We ate quickly and got back on the road as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Not my first bad experience at this panda express, they have made large mistakes with my order on 3 separate occasions when I went through the drive through. Today I was smart enough to enter the restaurant to make sure my order would be correct, but I was notified when I came in they were out of white rice, chow mein, and steamed vegetables and they only had brow rice. I was then told it would be 5 minutes for steamed vegetables or chow mein, and 45 minutes for white rice! I elected to wait the 5 minutes for steamed vegatables... then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for my food. It would have been a quicker experience if I sat down and dined at P.F. Chang's"}
{"text":"This Panda Express does not care about quality of food. I have ordered here a couple of times and had delivery. Recently our last two experiences have been horrible, we used Uber eats as we have in the past and left detailed instructions on supplying sauces and silverware. Each time we get our food it's wrong, the food is old and when you call, you get told they will make it fresh if I come down? That's horrible. I will never order here     Updated review 4-4-2018 So once again, we tried Panda and the same result, except this time they left two things out of my meal and 1 our of my wife's. As you can clearly see they can't even fill the boxes they label.. but of course they want to invite you in? For what? For other people to see you care? You have lost valuable customers and now can refund me my money!"}
{"text":"Went to this location and was rushed from begging to end and this girl named Nereida was being so rude! Like for no reason she gave me smart remarks felt very disrespected in many ways kept asking me the same question over and over to like who hired this girl?!!"}
{"text":"Cashier was very rude, her name is Catherine. Orange chicken is spicy I don't know why!"}
{"text":"It's sad to see all of the negative reports. Laveen doesn't have many options so of course the restaurant will get busy. I have always been greeted when I enter the restaurant, asked if I'd like a sample and offered a beverage while preparing my order. Now THAT is good customer service. The quality is the same at all Panda locations so no complaints there.   Those young kids work their buts off and deserve recognition for having to \"put on a happy face\" when customers are rude and inconsiderate. Kudos to the Laveen a Panda team."}
{"text":"This place is defenatly getting better. There is new management, new cooks, and new servers. All faster and more friendly than before."}
{"text":"Just wanted to apologize to the workers at this store today, my friends and I came in the second it closed without realizing it. When we looked up the hours google stated that this store closes at 11:30 but on the door there it said 9:30. The chef cooked some fresh orange chicken for us without hesitation and the staff was super friendly! We never would've realized our rudeness until our friend told us the actual hours after leaving. Really appreciate you serving us!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and the service is sub par. The food is what it is : fast food Chinese -cheap, greasy, & convenient.  I came in at 9:40pm, craving for some orange chicken. I walked to the window and noticed an empty silver platter where the orange chicken normally resides. I look up and politely asked the teenager if she could make some since they are clearly still open and I was given a bitchy answer \"sorry we can't do that \". In disbelief, I said you guys don't close for 20 minutes. Still no. So I walked out and I refuse to go back."}
{"text":"If you are open until 9:30pm, you should serve your food until 9:30pm. I drove the extra mileage to this specific store because they were open half an hour later than other stores in the area. When I arrived, the staff behind the counter rudely told me they were closing soon when I said hello and pointed to haphazard piles of the leftover entrees (which, by the way, were all mixed up, so too bad for anyone with any food allergies) and told me to pick what I wanted from that.   Okay, I understand the low food inventory at the end of the night. But if a customer comes in for a take-away order of premade food that requires you to do nothing extra other than scoop it on a plate for them, AND it is still within your store's business hours, don't treat them like they've just presented you with an enormous inconvenience. It's literally your job.   Never been to this location before and will definitely never be back. Panda Express on Frank Lloyd Wright, you are not special. If you don't treat your customers with respect, they will just go elsewhere."}
{"text":"No stars for this place, there's another reason why I will never go back to this place.  A while back my husband got food poisoning and stopped going. I decided to give it another chance and stopped by to get something for dinner. The first issue was having 4 cars and waited for ever. Now I pull up to order and she mentions there is no rice, which didn't matter because i hate it.  So I order chowmein, orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp.  I then proceed to order a kids meal, chowmein and orange chicken and that's when she tells me there is no orange chicken so i ask for teriyaki and she says they don't have that either.  So I start feeling irritated and so I ask her what she has and so I switched to beef and broccoli.  I also order 2 chicken egg rolls which she had mentioned she had, so she says one or two I repeat myself two and then she says thet don't have anymore. There's cars behind me so not only is she waiting my time but the people behind me. So I cancelled my order and she still has the nerve to say that it will clear the screen once I pull up to the window, girl didn't I just tell you to cancel!! So i tell her I'm not stopping at the window cause I don't want anything.  What kind of restaurant is this, super poor quality service."}
{"text":"The longest line ever for just orange chicken!! I swear they went looking for the chicken in the farm somewhere!!"}
{"text":"try the Orange Chicken it's awesome and spicy very clean restaurant lots of variety of Sodas teriyaki chicken noodles etc. good times"}
{"text":"They were very kind and I did not feel rushed. I even asked at the intercom to remove an item, and she didn't sound to have a problem with doing so. I felt the drive thru was a fast experience compared to stepping inside their store. I will be back for seconds and thirds!  The honey walnut shrimp was perfectly crisp with softness to it the day on purchased it on 3/30/2018. Some other locations put to much glaze and it makes it too soft and falls apart."}
{"text":"This is the second time in a row that I have stopped in first time about a month ago approx 2pm this time 830pm. Both visits exceptional! Store is clean (table, chairs, counters) food is ready and good. Service was great with samples offered. It appears \"Ping\" is in charge and runs a tight ship. I appreciate it, it shows at all levels she cares. Been a long time since I let half my meal get cold to write a review, but they are doing a good job at this location. Thanks Panda at 9th n Bell rd."}
{"text":"This location is always popping! They always have all of the entrées readily accessible and the flavor is always good. when I'm on the Westside, this is a great place to come for a quick casual meal. The service is pumped into the point not overly friendly though."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed that I had to wait 5min to be greeted for my order because an off the clock employee with a book bag on had to make his plate first and take the last scraping of entrees from a few of their serving pans. What happened to the customer being first?? Now 1/2 of their entrees are gone during dinner rush. When I went to pay, the cashier accepted my money and said she'd be right back. She took my ten dollar bill to the cash-register by the drive-thru window and brought me back change. I think they're having an off day where anything goes!"}
{"text":"I really like the vibe at this Panda. There are Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling and hipster music playing.  I had to bump 1 star because the guy making my plate was chintzy on the entree portions. I ordered the shrimp entree which is $1.25 extra, but then he picked me out 5 or 6 shrimp and I had to ask him to include some walnuts since they were supposed to be part of the dish. Most of the entrees were available and plentiful. Good experience"}
{"text":"I came to panda for lunch today and they have done an excellent job with getting a lot of customers thru the line quickly with top quality food. Last time I had a bad customer service experience but things have been great today. I can overlook the bad service of one customer service representative if the rest of them are excellent."}
{"text":"It's nice when you're greeted as you walk in the door by employees! The food was all fresh and delicious. The teriyaki chicken was not burnt, unlike some other panda express locations in the valley. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this place unless you're in the mood to be angry. I am so appalled at the way my family was treated by the manager Selena when we opted to dine in during open hours. She warned us that they would be closing in 10 minutes but I was confused, the sign on the door said they close at 10 o'clock and it was only 9:20 PM. She came over to us a few minutes later and told us they were closing and I let her know we were aware. She then stood there as if we were supposed to get up and leave so I told her if you want us to leave, we can leave now but that's very unprofessional because this franchise establishment states on the door that you are open until 10. Never mind the fact that everything was all packed away by 9:30 PM and all the food was cold... What if a customer came through the drive-through? Oh I know, they would be turned away because there were no other meal provisions available. Additionally I feel terribly uncomfortable and Claster phobic that they locked us in at 9:30PM. I will never go back to this panda express under any circumstance other than to point the manager out to her higher-ups for reprimanding."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here they short me my food. Once again I give them another chance and go inside to order and entree and 2 egg rolls. I had to wait to get the egg rolls no big deal. They come out with my food & I check everything (besides the egg rolls because I didn't think counting to 2 would be that hard) and then proceed home. Well who would thought I open the bag for the egg rolls and there's ONE. Point is these people that run this place have no common sense & I can't imagine what goes on in the kitchen. Won't be back & would recommend anyone going here to try Krua Thai Quisine or Flame Broiler much much better staff and food."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying I rarely eat any sort of Oriental food, mainly because it just never sits well in my stomach, but I do enjoy the taste so I will try and make this review as unbiased as possible.   1. The food taste good- thats the most important thing, right? It's by no means on the level of a sit down Hibachi style restaurant but we're talking fast food here so I'm not going to compare apples and oranges. I love fried rice and ate a lot of it growing up and compared to the home cooked stuff I am used to this fried rice is kinda plain. There is not a flavor to out that really stands out. Most likely due to the fact that they cook the fried rice in such bulk that it's more quantity then quality. The orange chicken was really good and the meat doesn't tast too fast foodie. I wouldn't compare it to eating a chicken nugget from McDonalds.   2. The price- It's a little more expensive then say Burger King or McDonalds but i am ok with that because I don't feel like I am eating half food half grease. I got Fried rice and a double order of Orange chicken with a drink and it cost me roughly $8.25. It was a good chunk of both so I only ended up eating half of it. I eat like a bird anyway. Seconds anyone?  3. The service- While there was no real delay in getting food (it's semi buffet style so they serve your food you just walk down and pick what you want) The employees aren't really cheerful. They weren't mean or rude by any means, they just didn't seem to happy to be there.    I work really close to this place but have only been to it two or three times in the past 2 months. Like I said, my stomach does not like me when I eat Chinese so I do my best to stay on it's good side."}
{"text":"I really LOVE the honey walnut shrimp. The sauce and texture of it just works in my mouth!! This location is pretty friendly and will cook a dish for you if it isn't FRESH. I usually do a 2 combination plate with half chow mein and half fried rice, honey walnut shrimp, and sweet fire chicken breast! I've tried everything they have and if I really wanna switch it up I'll get the angus beef. Pretty standard as far as Panda's go...."}
{"text":"service was great but food was horrible! i ordered Shanghai beef as i  was  eating i noticed the meat was red and raw very nasty! i let the cashier know she replaced it with a new side, the cook has to go this is by far the worse panda i have been to it ruined my day"}
{"text":"hi Alejandra, thanks for the reply and concern. that would be awesome but iam unable to send you a dm. if you can send me a dm then i can reply. i appreciate it and thanks for letting upper management know about my issue. thanks again hope to hear from you soon!"}
{"text":"the worst asian food anywhere The sign jokingly says gourmet  Its a joke and waste of $ to eat there"}
{"text":"Poorly managed. 7:20 pm and they are out of everything! I guess the manager wants to close early or decreases left overs. Long line waiting for fired rice, teriyaki chicken, broccoli beef, etc... Company should perform a site inspection. BTW, just asked for tap water to go with my order and was told they DO NOT HAVE TAP WATER!!!!! Wow, 1st Panda that does not carry tap water. Poor planning, poor management. Not even a \"sorry\" after 18 mins wait for my meal. Lastly, the white rice is cold and the teriyaki chicken has SKIN on. Never had skin before at Panda."}
{"text":"Haters be damned, Panda Express satiates my light lunch cravings on a budget. Near my work and located inside Vons, I'm able to get a large serving of steamed veggies with vitamins, minerals, and fiber a la carte for about $3.60. Every visit the worker has to cook a fresh batch because they never have any on standby. I'm guessing nobody orders veggies. I totally don't mind. I would gladly have a freshly cooked garden over semi-old, sitting over the hot-ass steam veggies that nobody wants any day.  A few caveats though, it's obvious these are frozen variety so if you're expecting to be blown away, you're SOL.  The steamed veggies have as much flavor as Mitt Romney. Add some chili, soy sauce, or spicy mustard to bring it life. The carrots are the crinkle kind and it can taste and feel like cardboard. Out of nutritional guilt, I'll force myself to eat these orange taproots to get my vitamin A for the day.  Meat-wise I've only tried the mandarin chicken and that shit was cooked to oblivion and once bitten, it had the texture of bad sashimi. Gross. Nearby is a Starbucks so I'm able to get my trenta (unsweetened) iced green tea to complete my lunch. Total win."}
{"text":"This Panda Express location is now my favorite one!  I will return to this location every time we go out for Panda.  The employees were very friendly.  The restaurant was clean.  The food was fresh!!!  Thank you!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Panda Express restaurants and recently moved to Huntersville- I've got to say, this one gets my gold medal for food and service. The food is always hot and ready to be served. On RARE occasion, if you need to wait for something, you can tell they really feel bad by apologizing and giving you a drink because of the wait. It's something special when you look forward to going to restaurant because the employees make you feel important (when really you're just one in hundreds they service that day!). I need to give a shoutout to Turk, Charlie, and Shaday who really keep this place working at 5-stars at all times."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Panda Express. I figured how bad could it be. It's fast and convenient. Well, the answer is........it's incredibly bad. Everything was overcooked. Dried out and mostly tasteless. Next time, I will stick with supermarket Chinese. At least you know what to expect. Quite frankly, I've got no idea how anyone can eat this stuff!"}
{"text":"Well..... Don't ask for pot stickers when they don't have any because they will be red about it when you ask. Oh and if your debit card doesn't run through because you use it too much and it's a little worn b prepared to have cash because they won't even try to type your number in."}
{"text":"I thought the building was nice, clean and had a cool design. The food wasn't bad either. Not amazing, but I guess what you'd expect at a Chinese fast food place. The Shanghai Angus Steak was tasty. However I thought the Chow Mein was a little dry. Not bad for a $7 meal though. The egg roll was decent but had a little bit more ginger flavor than I'm used to.   I suppose I'd come back if in the area, but you're probably better sticking into the Chinese take out places."}
{"text":"I would prefer to give 0 stars! I was craving some sweet fire chicken and chow mein and fried rice so i went by for lunch and ordered an2 entree. Got home and on my 3rd bite, there was a curly black hair. I have straight light brown/blonde hair. I immediately started gagging and threw up. Meal ruined! So grossed out! I won't be going back again!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited when I came across panda express... In Canada! The orange chicken has been my favourite since high school.. But I was only able to have it when I visited the US!   The service was great, the girls were very polite and offered samples of the entrees before ordering.. Was greeted upon arrival and when leaving!"}
{"text":"Loved the customer service. Fernanda the lead counter did a great job giving us the freshest food possible."}
{"text":"How do people eat this crap it's horrible food go to pei Wei it's a step up for the same price."}
{"text":"This place is all frozen meat that's already breaded in some factory deep fried and tossed with a pre made sauce. Expensive for what it is. I much rather prefer Pei Wei for the same price."}
{"text":"I'm all for hiring minorities but in the interest of customer relations some discretion has to be used. Speaking English is an example.  I gave her an order to go and before taking it up she said $7.90 when the price on the wall said $7.20. I said no and pointed to the price. She rattled off something I could not understand and said no, $7.90. Big deal, so I said okay.  She then asks several other questions but her English is so bad I don't understand any of it.  Then she appears to get frustrated (I am already there). The other employees stand there and watch like it's a side show at the circus.  End result?  I walk out with no food. Big mistake coming here.  Lesson: hire minorities, but if they can't speak fluent English DO NOT PUT THEM ON THE FRONT LINE UNTIL THEY CAN!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda Express EVER!!!!! Yolanda is such a rude old hag!!! They're always out of food and even used a TRASH BAG to put our food in! My husband asked Yolanda for chopsticks and she completely ignored him. She even dropped a scooper on the floor and put it back in the chicken like nothing happened. The manager is such a joke-- how do you run an establishment SO bad? Over priced & awful. Will never ever be going back!"}
{"text":"My mom loves Panda Express, so I'm usually here with my mom or on my way to her house. This particular trip was no exception, as I had to buy her some  Orange Chicken.  If you've never been to a Panda Express, I'll explain how it works: You walk into this place and have options on what you want in terms of meal sizes. 2-entree plate? 3-entree plate? Family Panda Feast? Take your pick. Then you pick either chow mein or fried rice (or both!), plus your choice of entrees. It's quick, it's pretty good, and it's priced right.   In terms of what's good to eat here, I'd say you can't go wrong with the Orange Chicken. It's pretty good, and it's consistently a top-seller there. I like the Honey Walnut Shrimp and Sweet and Sour Pork, too.  You should know that nothing here is of exceptional quality. There's nothing here that's going to blow your mind with how good or how fresh or well-prepared it is. That's not to say this place is bad. It's just good Chinese food that's made quick and it's a value."}
{"text":"Steak and shrimp bowl was delicious and made fir s great fast lunch. I prefer Panda over another similar chain as I like the Mobil app much better. Ordering in advance with the panda app is easy and clear."}
{"text":"Your typical Panda Express. This was the only open food stand in the morning that was not serving breakfast food.   Located in the Grand Canal Food Court at Venetian.   They did not have much to choose from at 10 am but they had the basics I wanted.   3 Item Plate - $10.40 - Orange Chicken, Beef Broccoli, and Mushroom Chicken with Half and Half Rice/Noodles. Always hits the spot when I think of Panda food. Good portion sizes on the scoops."}
{"text":"I saw all the negative reviews for this location and was slightly concerned. But my food was delicious and warm and the service was speedy and friendly. I 100% will return!"}
{"text":"I came into this location for dinner with some friends and they had no food ready to go, when the cashier asked the cook to do it he gave a lot of attitude and then started to make the food 3 minutes later."}
{"text":"Fast food is supposed to be just that. Every time I go to a Panda Express they are always out of some dish. It's not like there is a rush either, this store has very view customers right now. I think the problem is due to the youth working there not being able to keep up with food. If my wife didn't like Panda, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I'm at the worst panda ever.  Again.  Thankfully I'm here for Postmates.  Always out of something.  Been in drive thru for 15 minutes.  Behind 6 cars.  Nobody has moved. 4 employees inside.  1 dishing out and 3 cleaning.  I'm waiting to hear them tell me that they are no longer serving because it's after 10pm.  Even though I've been here since 9:50.  It's now 10:08."}
{"text":"Very surprised this place has so many negative reviews.   I've ate here many times and have always had a great experience. Food is always good and the staff is always friendly. Have also used their drive thru a few times and it's been nice and quick.  I can say I highly recommend this place and will continue to visit it frequently."}
{"text":"The management and service at this location is horrible. The wait is ridiculously long and you end up waiting in line forever even after your food is ready to go. They have a line filling up and only one register open."}
{"text":"This new location will be the reason I gain 20 lbs this holiday season and why no one will be getting any presents (pssst, too broke). I live for their orange, teriyaki, and string bean chicken. Now I don't even have to get out of the car or wait 10+ minutes for some Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Nothing like waiting 20 minutes in the drive thru, which is a great option, but not at the expense of screwing up my $26.50 order. How hard is it to remember to put terryaki sauce in your order when I ordered terryaki chicken?!?"}
{"text":"Place is always packed. So why is it always understaffed and lacking forecasting of food. They will also never sell you the food on the pan even though its enough for 4 meals....they make you wait 10 minutes for them to make more food. They constantly run out of teriyaki and....annoying."}
{"text":"Worst panda I've been to. little food and stale. they charged me a dollar for a shrimp item, just to find out there was only 3 shrimps and the rest vegetables and it was rubbery. disgusting."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the staff is too.There is a Hispanic girl with a tat who is super friendly. I love this location."}
{"text":"I will avoid commenting on the food because everyone knows what their getting when heading to Panda.   What shines are at the Red Rock location is the freshness of their entrees. While taking in a snack at 8pm, I noticed the servers changing every single entree in the service line. Very comforting to a minor germophobe."}
{"text":"Since this is the 2nd bad experience in a row, I decided to write a review. Last week when I went in there was no honey walnut shrimp around 6pm, but I was told there would be some ready soon. No big deal, it's dinner and that means it would be fresh so I didn't mind waiting. I got a 3 entree plate, a large orange chicken, a rice bowl, and a large drink. After we payed, I got the bag and thought it felt a little light for the amount of food I ordered. I checked, and the orange chicken was left out. The guy that forgot it didn't apologize when I went back to the cashier, he walked away. She was very nice and gave me a coupon for a free small drink or orange chicken.  I felt that was resolved and was fine. But, lo and behold, when I got home and opened my plate...there were 3 pieces of shrimp (which I waited for and paid extra for) and 2 strips of chicken and a few green beans. The plate was 90% rice!!!  $30 for rice.  Now for tonight, I go in at 8:45 ( they close at 10). The first thing I see is no honey walnut shrimp. When I ask, I'm told they are out for the night. Really, they are out or the don't want to cook any?  So I go for my next option...orange chicken. Guess what?  They are out and will have to cook some. If they still have an hour and and 15 minutes left to sell food, maybe they should have food. We just walked out. The whole point of going out to eat is to actually get served food to eat. It is so frustrating to go somewhere and experience a complete lack of care for you as a customer. I may try another location, but with so many options I may give up Panda altogether. I guess I was spoiled by the awesome food and service from the PE in Ft. Walton Beach, FL. So far, Vegas has been awful for food and customer service."}
{"text":"I have to give it an extra star for not being McDonalds... Panda is average at best. I love their orange chicken, but sometimes it can sit there too long and it becomes in edible. Service at this location is hit or miss and usually the early afternoon is the best time to go... Sucks if you really felt like going for dinner."}
{"text":"So apparently they close at 7:30 for Father's Day. That is fine, but at 6:45 why is half the food options gone? I ask if they ran out of everything and the guy says \"well we are about to close.\" ????? They are open for 45 more minutes!! They clearly were packing up everything and ready to get out of there way earlier than 7:30."}
{"text":"This location must be very well managed because the staff is incredibly friendly and the service is fast. They get the order right and the veggies are always fresh. A+"}
{"text":"the design of this place makes ZERO sense .. we actually got caught in our car when we tried to leave because of how slow the service is at the drive thru & how it wraps around the lot .. that being said glad I went inside for slow service vs sitting in that drive thru line for it .. if you decide to bail out you have precious short time & space to do so .. after that you are STUCK .. the inside design for packaging food is no better .. both lines kept running out of food (you would think they would be more prepared during a peak time .. 6pm .. but NOT) .. they were totally out of both beef dishes offered which left you with chicken & .. well, more chicken .. if you did not like shrimp .. had to wait nearly 30 minutes for orange chicken because drive thru service kept taking it from the other line so in the end there were about 6 of us inside the joint waiting .. a manager was nowhere to be seen leaving very young kids doing the best they can to run the show .. the food was not worth the wait in the end . zero starts for the horrible design & slow service & less than mediocre food .. the 1 star is to stick up for a very inexperienced staff that despite the chaos did the best they could & I give them kudos for mustering the smiles they did thru it all .. will probably not return .. EVER .."}
{"text":"I love panda. Today I was treated like I was stupid. They gave me the least amount of portions they possible could without the plate showing through.   Seemed like the bosses needed more profits or something. It was a very uncomfortable feeling for me.   We had to order three times what we usually do.   Someone made some mistakes with chili sauce and made my kids freak out. We like hot food but certain things we order for a baby shouldn't be hot !   Disaster. The employees did the management no favors by making he customer feel cheated. Won't be back to this one. Ever. Close it."}
{"text":"We had a nice to go meal from here. The orange chicken is fabulous! Beef with broccoli was fresh still crispy. $8.50 plate gives three choices.  All was very good including fried rice!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here, they don't like to fill the portion, it is funny. Never seen anything like this any other panda express. On the other hand, the cashier is asking: do you wanna donate for....uumm...I forgot...umm, typhoon or something? Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's a 20 minute wait for the drive through. There was only one other car in line. Inside was empty as well. No rice of any kind is being served and still sat in the drive trough for twenty minutes. Apparently management doesn't know what they are doing. Will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick Chinese fix..we are moving and most of our things are packed...i had the large meal...the honey shrimp was amazing...and thats where I stop with the great review....the general tso chicken that they advertise was too sweet for me. I prefer mine a bit spicy..and with the beef and broccoli when broccoli outweighs the beef 4 to 1 i have an issue...the chow main was basic and had no flavor as well as the rice.  The egg roll was sub par for cleveland...will not frequent this place on a regular for my chinese fix"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with this location. I came in at 9:30 on a Thursday night. They had no chow mein, and the only entrees they had were orange chicken and teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"This is the friendly restaurant I have ever been in. Free High-Fives to everyone. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"every time i do carry out at this location they toss the food into a lame plastic bag and the boxes always open in the car & leak!!!! you're a to-go fast food place figure out your carry out packaging!  i hate pabda right now!!!!"}
{"text":"Panda is good, quick food. I don't know if it's considered Chinese food. It's more like americanized Chinese food. I like it every now and then. We eaten at this location twice in a month or so. It's clean, quick, and food is good."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hard working staff! Everything is excellent! Food service and Store service across the board Yummy! Thank you May for helping me with my survey and getting my dinner packed up nicely. Everything is hot and even though I waited on y Mother's fresh tofu to come out the experience was quick and worth the wait. We'll be dining here again this week! May you made my Panda experience amazing. You work very hard and it shows at your location! Arkeka is very sweet and goes out of her way--thanks for getting my mother a set of silverware TOGO!"}
{"text":"Mandorian chicken is not avalible anymore! :( and the teryaki seems burt.... :("}
{"text":"I was here and my food spilled at the register area. I would've been fine if it was just a little spill but literally all of the food in the bowl fell over on the counter and floor. Jackie was really understanding and nice about getting me another bowl. I talked to the manager Sabrina and although I could tell she didn't want to give it to me for free, she did it anyways. I am very appreciative of that since it could've been more stress to add to my plate since I am getting married tomorrow. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Chinese food on the go. Everything tasted excellent and received friendly service with a smile."}
{"text":"It's on campus, and convenient. It isn't as good as other panda express I've been to, in the recipes they use are a little different than other pandas as well. One thing I don't like is that they charge for refills of soda pop. This is the first hand I've ever been to the charges for refills. The food comes in a to-go box and not on a plate which I am ambivalent about but the menu selection is very limited compared to other panda express. I've eaten here when the items in the hot table really look old and quite nasty, Other times the food actually looks fresh-ish."}
{"text":"Is this a 5 star restaurant...no, not at all. But I'm rating it on whether or not they deserve an excellent rating for what category of restaurant/food service they intend to deliver based on price per meal, the type of food served etc.  They get 5 stars for the following: - good customer service - consistent food quality and taste  -freshness of food served - cleanliness of restaurant   Smiles at every turn...yeah they were fast but never rude. And if they were ever less than friendly - it's a fast food place with 8 dollar plates...if you want to build a relationship with someone - I'm more concerned for you and why you'd want to do this at a fast food place?!?  Food tastes just like the mall, just like the other stand alone restaurants and is consistent with what they promise...fast, fresh, Americanized Chinese food. Better than a burger or burrito most days and makes you feel like you are at least making an effort to not eat crap everyday.  I was impressed with the transparency of the veggie fridge and the cooks in the back...high fired woks and chefs preparing very nearly as they probably do in higher dollar restaurants. If you have a hankering for Chinese, Panda Express is always a quick fix with satisfying results...this location is no exception. Swing by, it's clean inside and the food is good."}
{"text":"I honestly love this location! Blanca is always so welcoming and friendly. Her personality definitely makes it a fun experience! Every time I come in my food is fresh or if I ask for it to be made fresh they will make it. We ordered the orange chicken and Kung pow chicken tonight and it was soooo yummy. I love coming back here because the staff makes me feel like I live in a small town where people know each other and say hi with a smile."}
{"text":"Boy does this place suck. I am feeling good today so I will avoid giving a one star review. The food here is hit or miss. They totally jipped me on food portions. If I'm going to freakin pay this much for fast food Chinese food at least give me a decent portion. The only thing this place is good for is getting forks and spoons to put in my desk because my work believes in \"going green.\" This includes not providing utensils in the break room."}
{"text":"WORST LOCATION IN ARIZONA. I love Panda Express and have always had great experiences at every other location. However this location is by far the worst I've ever been to. Many people I know feel the same. The restaurant is clean and the service is sufficient, but the food is very rarely fresh. Obviously you can ask them to make a fresh batch just for you, but this will require you to wait an extra ten minutes. At that point it may not be considered \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"I just stopped for food here and Wow, it was horrible. The staff can't understand English nor speak it. The give me very lil food on my to go order. The availability of food was very low and dry. Although, I wanted a good serving thank goodness I didn't get it. The food tasted disgusting, very dry, burnt and not fresh. I threw my food out after a couple bites-should have returned it and asked for a full refund.. very dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"The food is average a.m. nothing circular or different than any other location however they do make their orange chicken quite pricey compared to other location which is been more than just one time that I have experienced this so I'll probably hold off on going back for a while since my children are young and don't like the spicy of the orange chicken which results in wasting food and money doesn't go but he's favorite thing to do?... I am not one to try to avoid public restroom, unfortunately I am potty training my twin and they needed to use the restroom said we had there and it was awful,!!! Is to say the very least because the restaurant was absolutely disgusting and I could not even believe the amount of filth in that restroom.  Not to mention that it was a food establishment. I am pretty understanding that things happen and it's often times out of the control and this was not the case because you have a grinder and always feel that was more than something that happened over the course of a couple of hours or even a day.  I just prayed the staff actually washes their hands! Other than that I should Urbanna and Peder is the right; the remainder of the establishment is typical of a PS Express with The excessive really long line order, except this place takes forever for their line to move. I would suggest ordering at whenever possible. I was able to call ahead and place my order by phone Love you for pick up within minutes which was great. You can put on their website, not app but website,.... yes, strange I know people order from the website... And that fly I ordered five because seriously there's an app for that, right?"}
{"text":"Panda Express seems to be close to the same everywhere. It's good for fast food and close to where I live. Clean, fast, and inexpensive, but not unique."}
{"text":"Best crew, Best Manager Anna, clean and very friendly! I love this Panda!!! The food is fresh every time I order from here."}
{"text":"Not to sure what the other reviews were expecting if you want authentic oriental food there is a great Pho resturant a complex over and a great chinese place on eglington this is mall food court chinese. The same stuff you would buy in any mall food court.   to me its comfort food, its the stuff I'm used to having at the mall growing up. It's good though better than chicken balls with that crappy red sauce. I always order the fried rice and firecracker chicken  and orange chicken to have on my lunch break from work and I love it.  It can't be that bad since everyone I work with seems to like it too, not too sure what other reviewers expected sometimes I wonder if the people reviewing place really know what they're going into.   All in all, Panda express would be good mall food court food and is great for the fast food asian craving!."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The staff were mean and stingy. The food was fake Chinese and unhealthy."}
{"text":"This establishment had poor service. The staff was scattered and kept asking which plate was mine at least 4 times. They also ran out of chow mein so I gave up waiting for that and stuck with the inferior rice option."}
{"text":"Time my colleague and I walked into Panda - between 12:05-12:10pm Time on my receipt - 12:33:26PM    My colleague and I get there to find a line backed up to the door.  Now, at the other PE that I've been to (on 40th/Thomas), this isn't a problem.  The 40th/Thomas location moves people.  This Old Town/South Scottsdale location on the other hand assumes people don't have anywhere to be or that no one that comes in on their lunch hour.  There was plenty of food on the line (at least plenty of what we were going to order) so waiting on the \"kitchen\" to get out food was not an issue.     We stood in line waiting to get up to the counter.  We stood in line waiting to pay for our food.  There's no excuse for there to be 3 or 4 people on the line jumping over one another to fill orders when there is only 1 person at the cash register.  And about 95% of the time, the person at the cash register was also filing orders.    I think the people that work the food/customer line are in need of training.  Cause it was a total cluster-fuck.  And, if a customer's order is on hold cause what they want is being cooked, how about take the people that have a complete order and ring them up and get them out the door.    Thank goodness my next work meeting wasn't until 1pm.    I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"This Panda has the fastest drive-thru I've ever been to. It seems like from when I place my order to pulling up to the window I can't even pullout out my wallet fast enough, seriously! My son absolutely loves Panda and I'm not the fan of drive-thru Chinese but if your quick on time and need a go-to, this is the spot. Plus, the weathers been A1 so we took our lunch to the park to enjoy. 4 stars on speediness, friendliness and portion size.  1 Star off on pricing! YOWZERS, almost $9 for 2 entree plate nowadays? I must be getting old because I remember when it was under $6. Blast out some Panda coupons! Punch-card or somethin!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch - another day with the line out the door, employees barely moving and today's fun addition was that it was hotter inside than it was outside!  GOOD GRIEF!  The building is equipped with roll down shades, it's literally 110 with heat index today yet every single-pane window in the place was wide open with sun beaming inside.  That combined with the exposed kitchen puffing out clouds of steam, my visit today was ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE and I will not return until the fall, period.  Other customers looked unhappy and sweaty.  Those poor men in suits!  :-(  It should be common sense to use your blinds on a day like today!  To simply allow your paying customers to sit in that misery is unacceptable and I, for one, will certainly not forget today's experience.  Fail."}
{"text":"Place was pretty good. Went in around 1:30. As soon as I walked in the manager greeted me. Young guy, Didn't remember his name but I saw it says manager on his nametag. Lady who helped me with my food was nice and smiled. At the same time the manager asked me about a tattoo I have on my arm just for the sake of conversation and engaging with the customer so that was appreciated. Real friendly. I was in and out in less than 3 minutes. Iv seen the bad reviews this place gets, maybe some people just come in at the wrong time. Clean, friendly staff and management."}
{"text":"Clean.  Nice workers.  But let's face it...quality Chinese food, this ain't.  The vegetables had a weird film of...something.  Everything else tasted very sugary and overly salty all at once.  But in a pinch, it'll fill your belly and not break your wallet."}
{"text":"They are good at giving samples. My go to meal is the chow mein and orang chicken. Lunchtime is always busy- its better go get there at 11 fkr lunchm. I gave this location a 4 star because the Bathroom could be cleaner."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the free orange chicken night with our coupons about 10pm Friday night.  Then we decided to order two meals.    As we ordered, I told the lady what I wanted, and she told the second lady what she needed to do.  Now the second lady was either not listening or didn't care what she did cause she just put whatever in the box then told the third lady to ring me up.  They were getting both our orders wrong and I asked the second lady several times what I wanted, but they were not listening at all.  It's like they were just talking amongst themselves and could careless about us.  The line was getting really long because the girls were not getting our stuff right and I was getting upset.  And I think they over charged us too.  $26 for two meals.  I know of better places, really.    We did come back to complain to the manager the next day and they did give us two free meals, but I hardly ever come to this place and most likely will not come back.  I gave two stars just because they gave us two free meals the next day.  Customer service here is nonexistent.  The food was decent but really oily.  Be prepared to have the farts all night.  If you go to Panda, always order to go even if you dine in cause they give you a lot more."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but service lacks this  time around. I ordered orange chicken and pecking chicken with fried rice and a medium chow mein. I had to wait for the pecking chicken to come out, which is fine but when it did i didn't get mine served after it came out. Thinking they had puy my portion in my food tray i payed and left with out getting it, and didn't realized until i got home... Their was too much small talk and not paying attention to what's going on."}
{"text":"Good tasting food. Been coming here for years and haven't been let down. This is probably my go to panda"}
{"text":"Don't go after 8:00 pm. They just want to close 8 and you out of there. Twice went in late and all I saw was staff mopping and a limited menu. I won't spend another dime here. I recommend the Elliot/I-10 location instead."}
{"text":"Horrible. The lady rolled her eyes when I told her my order wasn't done she tried to rush me and was very rude. I don't understand why people don't care about their work ethic I mean it's fast food I know but atleast treat it like it's a job. I'm sure the manager can find 1000 other students to hire who will treat customers better. please rehire new workers or should I say worker if I don't give you attitude or I'm not rude please don't treat me this way. I was no way rude or demanding in anyway even though I'm a customer. Never will go to this location 4 block drive is worth it for the broadway and rural location."}
{"text":"This location is staffed with a bunch of employees who can't handle the simple task of reading an order ticket and placing said order item in the bag. Making a special trip back for side items that they can't seem to get into the bag the first time around, pisses me off.  Nuff said-hire people who can read."}
{"text":"The fried rice was too sticky & didn't even taste like how it's suppose to. My mom & I couldn't even finish our meal because for one the rice was way too sticky, second of all they couldn't even cut the teriyaki chicken properly. Please cook/cut your food properly next time. Other than that everything was okay, but we are really dissatisfied with our meal."}
{"text":"The lady that took my order was in a rush I guess because I said a bowl and she gave me a plate and put half chow mein and half rice. She was talking so fast I couldn't even tell her that that's not what I had said. Then she pretty much threw the receipt so I had to catch it. Worst experience at a panda I've ever had"}
{"text":"Oh, I don't know what I was thinking. I was in a rush as I had to get my oil changed and had to get back in the office for a web conference...craving Chinese food -I saw no other option.   I ordered the platter - 2 meats plus one side but I asked if I could swap out a meat for extra veggies. The person working the counter was very polite.   So I ended up with the orange chicken, veggies, and rice (plus two spring rolls...although I wanted one not two this apparently isn't an option) for about $8. The chicken was alright - not bad,  the veggies were excellent - steamed but still crunchy and a great variety of green beans, carrots, cabbage, etc but what really bothered me was the rice. I kid you not it tasted like wet dog smells...that's my only description I can offer. I usually love rice and this looked great but the taste was so odd I could only handle a bite before I gave up. The spring rolls were bad...I've had better frozen, no seriously, Pagoda's are better.   1 star for veggies and 1/2 for pretty ok fast food orange chicken and polite service  I really wouldn't frequent this type of place to begin with and now I know why. Meh .."}
{"text":"No stars. The worst drive through experience ever. We were sixth in line and each car ahead of spent 4-8 minutes at the window. No explanation."}
{"text":"The kids like it but they don't know better.  I wouldn't call it Chinese food but it comes close.  I think it does the job for the moment.  I have been here a few times and I haven't had any stale food always a line maybe that's why.  Some places when food is sitting staying warm it gets hard and and nasty, I haven't had that problem yet and I hope I never."}
{"text":"I decided upon stopping at Panda Express to pick up a quick lunch, and this was the location I ended up at. The service was friendly and extremely fast. My sister and I each ordered a panda bowl and we were out of there in under five minutes. The location appeared to be moderately busy right at the typical lunch time, but there is no need to fret because they will have you out of there in no time. I must say the cashier was quite good at up-selling in a friendly matter - she made it seem as if you actually did need a drink to go with your meal. As for food readiness, all of the dishes seemed to be overflowing and ready for orders, as well as, a chef constantly cooking in the back. Overall, I ended up being quite pleased with Panda Express as a whole; they successfully provided me a delicious meal at a fairly affordable price."}
{"text":"This used to be our \"go to place\" when we didn't know what we would have for dinner. My wife and I had been going here about once every two to three weeks. Good food good service. NOT ANY MORE. The food portions are now smaller, the prices went up, and the help must be overworked because they are soooo unfriendly. Don't waste your time here. There are too many other places you can go to."}
{"text":"Food was horrible rice was hard and still white when it's supposed to be fried rice my aunt told me she ate it before and she was disappointed but thought I'd see for myself and she was right"}
{"text":"I like panda express, and I like this new layout. However if I'm going to eat somewhere I want to ne treated a certain way. I'm buying THEIR food with MY money. I can easily go to a different location. Fix the staff attitude please. \"they're high schoolers\" is no excuse. There is still a professional standard everyone has to follow. Get a shift manager that makes sure the restaurant is running smoothly and everyone is treated with the respect they should be given. Don't gossip the entire time."}
{"text":"Fix your online hours so I don't drive out of my way to your employees turning the open sign off early. Thanks."}
{"text":"I went there on a Monday and sat in the drive thru line, they said we will be with you shortly.  Well 5 minutes without my order being taken, I left. I believe in second chances, so two days later (Wednesday) I went.  I sat in the drive thru for a while, so this time I walked in the store and there was no urgency amongst the employees.  They were moving so slow, no wonder the drive thru line was so long.  So at the end of my order I asked for a medium beverage, I filled it up only to find out they were out of lids.  As a result I went back to the counter to ask for a lid, I got a look like \"I'm Busy don't bother\", so instead of waiting even longer I just grabbed a larger cup and transferred my beverage into the larger cup and put a lid on it.   The food at this place is average but the service is needs work.  I do not know if I will be back, I do not have that long for lunch break.  Panda \"Express\" hmm not so express."}
{"text":"For some reason there chowmain noodles now are filled with onion slices as we as so much cabadge . Seems to be a filler so it cost less to buy for there customers. Quality defiantly gone down. Smaller portions as well. Well guess we can blame min wadge going  well I am giving two thumbs prob won't be back."}
{"text":"I actually quite like Panda Express. Love orange chicken and black pepper chicken. But never order orange chicken with white rice !"}
{"text":"We waited almost 10mins before we was asked what we wanted. The employees are rude. Where you fill your drinks was completely discusting. They also needed to clean a couple of messy tables. I should have taken pictures."}
{"text":"I feel funny leaving a review for Panda Express, but I was so pleased with the quality of the food that I feel this is deserved. If you go during lunch or dinner, the food is always hot and fresh. The service is good and the restaurant is clean. Their staff is also very friendly.  Naturally, I usually get Orange Chicken and it's awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is always great customer service sucks it's usually this location this was the 2nd time w the same girl with the same attitude problem, when I asked her to put the teriyaki sauce on top her attitude changed but that's her job and after she put our food in the bag didn't even ask if we wanted to dine in or not but she asked the ppl behind us I don't want to write her name here I don't want her to get fired if you guys are reading this let your employees know how to properly work with customers"}
{"text":"Great Environment, Great Energy and with an awesome staff !! Also the store is always clean and the food is by far the best with great portions! This store has improved dramatically and is definitely one of my top choices for places to eat ! Go try it out for yourself and you'll see !"}
{"text":"With a location on Las Vegas Boulevard near the Outlet Center, this is a happening Panda Express.   Wow! This restaurant gets significant sunlight. For diners who dislike too much sunlight, the drapes are adjustable.   Owing to the above, this Panda Express feels more fast food than casual dining.    Just like the majority of Panda Expresses, the service and quality of food exceeds my expectations in fast food dining.    What I appreciate is this Panda Express served soup on my visit. Lately, it is rare to find soup in Vegas Panda Expresses.   A major drawback is that to drive here, you have to use the busy Outlet Mall parking lot. And it gets busy. And worst is that when you turn left onto Las Vegas Boulevard or Warm Springs Road, there is no traffic light.    Being a Panda Express fan, I will be back."}
{"text":"DOWNTOWN SUMMERLIN'S PANDA     My brother and I had been walking about a mile from Red Rock Resort to Sahara Avenue exploring the new star of Las Vegas : Downtown Summerlin. In the days before the restaurants open in downtown Summerlin for the Christmas season, there are a few choices as of November 4, 2014. Exploring  the southern quadrant of Downtown Summerlin where it abandons the unique pedestrian oriented streetscapes north of Dillard's for an ordinary auto oriented shopping center, my brother and I were hungry and we wanted to eat now. With Red Robin opening in a week, there were a few choices that included Five Guys and a hero place. We decided on Panda Express.     In Panda style, the service was good. In reality the service was better than a couple of full service restaurants I reviewed. When I say good service, I state that the employees were friendly and helpful. From ordering to paying, I was treated decently. On the other hand Verizon provided bad service. There was an issue with the Verizon signal in Panda Express and downtown Summerlin that affected my Internet experience.     The major flaw with Panda Express is that when an entrée is empty, it's display tray changes into an unappetizing display of tin, crumbs, and cooking oil. Some locations are more affected than others. The worst I have seen is the Pecos at Windmill Von's location. This location is moderately affected by this flaw. I would have preferred to order the egg plant if the majority of the tray wasn't cooking oil. I have always been under the impression that Panda Express corporate needs to develop a sheet or blanket to cover the tray when it is more cooking oil than entrée . Of course the panda, who in my opinion is one of the coolest fast food mascots, would adorn the cover sheet or blanket.     Fortunately a fair amount of the entrées were presented nicely. I ordered a two entrée combo with string beans and chicken, sesame chicken, fried rice, and chow mein. I appreciate Panda's noodle based chow mein more than some of the local Chinese restaurants in Vegas that include China Go Go. Panda's chili sauce added a burst of flavor to the chicken. With a medium Pepsi beverage, Panda was kind of worth $10 and change.     What are my chances of returning to the downtown Panda?      Regardless that Panda Express is good fast food, I doubt I will be returning to this location soon. I am optimistic that several restaurants will be opening in Downtown Summerlin by Christmas. Before or if  I return to this  Panda Express, I would have tried a couple of Downtown Summerlin's restaurants. And Red Robin is on the cue of restaurants that I intend to dine in and Yelp. For now, I depart from the Downtown Summerlin Panda with three stars."}
{"text":"If I had seen a Chinese restaurant in the vicinity of Charlie Frias Park that is rated highly, I would of made it lunch. I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch specials. They are one of the best deals in town. I didn't do my homework, and after burning fuel driving around, I wanted to grab lunch and get on with exploring Charlie Frias Park. I checked-in at the Panda.    These days my opinion of the Panda has changed. The average $9 plus tax transaction for a two item combo and medium beverage trails behind the pricing of genuine Chinese restaurants. Especially at lunch.     In my book, Panda Express is a good choice when it is in a large place with a captive audience or when the area lacks good Chinese restaurants. This location is an example. It is in a location where a transient stretch of Tropicana merges into Las Vegas communities. The majority of restaurants are fast food eateries in the shadow of the Orleans. When I dine here it is more out of convenience than hunger. In my situation it was near Charlie Frias Park, a quick yet creepy walk.    This Panda has a large footprint. I cannot see a problem with ever getting a table.     The chicken with mushrooms, fried rice (they also have brown), and chow mein was fast food good.  Where Panda outbeats local Chinese restaurant lunch specials is in their chow mein. At the local restaurants I often leave over the chow mein noodles where in Panda, the chow mein noodles on my plate turns to air. Problem! Chicken with mushrooms was not my food of choice. This location suffered from what I call the Panda Syndrom. This is a major flaw when the food trays are empty causing a presentation of metal and cooking oils (to put it kindly). This looks bad. They would be doing the customer a favor by putting a cover over the empty food trays. Possibly showing a panda with a frown saying \"Sorry we will be cooking new food.\"    When there is a good Chinese restaurant nearby and I am unrushed I will probably pass over Panda. However, when I am hungry and want to move on, the Panda will probably get some of my check-in love."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. However, good Chinese restaurants that serve lunch specials are not everywhere. That includes the Town Square Mall in Las Vegas. I'd settle for Panda Express.   This past Saturday I had lunch in the Town Panda Express. For the record it is one of the few fast food restaurants in Town Square. And for the record, regardless that it is close to five years old, it is one of the newer Las Vegas locations. Situated in the AMC Theater promenade in Town Square it is a relatively small location that provides one row of booths and tables. On a Saturday afternoon, the tables were nearly full to capacity. I can only imagine the seating capacity issue on a weekend movie night.  I started off this review by saying that I am a fan of the Chinese lunch special. I must emphasize that although I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant restaurant lunch special, I generally regard Panda Express favorably. In the following paragraph this review compares this Panda Express experience to the Chinese lunch special.  The first difference is the method of ordering. When I visit a Chinese restaurant, I generally order off a menu then wait for the cook to make my food. Walking into the Town Square Panda Express, the food was presented in tin trays (that's what I call them). The kitchen had made the food and now it was in a warm tray. The problem with this presentation is what I call the Panda syndrome. This is when an item is so low that the cooking oil dominates the tray. As I've mentioned in a couple of earlier Panda Express reviews, \"it is unappealing.\" There have been a couple of times that I walked out of a Panda Express because of this. As a matter of fact I passed over the eggplant with tufu because of the Panda syndrome. The second difference between the two are pricing. In general, a lunch special comes out to between $9 and $10 after tip. At Panda the two item combo with a small refillable Pepsi drink came out to $10.65. The difference in price is nothing remarkable. However, the difference in dining experience is noticeable considering that one is fast food and the other is a full service restaurant. The third difference is the familiarity of the product. The majority of Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas excluding China A Go Go are independently owned establishments that serve their own style of food. The fried rice at XO Chinese Restaurant might taste better than at China Wok. The nice thing about Panda Express is that their food is identical at each location. That is a good thing. I appreciate their fried rice, chow mein noodles, fire cracker chicken, and other items. In my humble opinion their soft chow mein noodles is far better than many of the independent Chinese restaurants. I ordered the soft chow mein noodles as one of the entrees while making the fried rice a side dish. As the picture shows, half the plate is fried rice. The second entrée I ordered was the fire cracker chicken. Lastly, at Panda Express the packet sauces play a greater roll in my experience than the Chinese restaurants. I will always top off the fried rice with at least two packets of soy sauce and the fire cracker or orange chicken with two packets of their hot sauce.  At the conclusion of my dining experience, I walked back outside to the AMC theater prominade temporarily filled up and satisfied. Regardless that this is a dining experience that falls short of many of the Chinese restaurant lunch specials that I've enjoyed in this city, I rate it \"3 Stars.\""}
{"text":"I just had supper here. This Panda Express did not let me down. Upon entering the restaurant, they greeted me with a 'welcome to Panda.' The entrees were just cooked. They gave me a nice portion. The restaurant has an atmosphere that is more casual than fast food. The instrumental music was a nice touch that provided for a casual fast food dining experience.   I eat at restaurants all over. This is one of many Panda Expresses that I dine at. So far it has not let me down."}
{"text":"Let's face it, the Galleria at Sunset is not breaking any records in its selection of restaurants. Unless you want to mimic Frogger and risk life and limb to venture to a nearby restaurant then the Panda is one of the better options here.    This Panda shares a food court with fast food icons including McDonald's, Subway, Orange Julies, and Sbarro. Regardless that the two item meal and medium Pepsi beverage is nearly $9, the price is at home in this food court. The $9 price does bring up a slight complaint. I notice that the shrimp and agnus steak (not the one in a steak house; pepper steak kind) is $1 extra. For the $9 price for a fast food meal, there is zero reason to add $1 to shrimp and agnus steak.     Sitting in the food court of a regional mall, there are groups of teenagers and children hanging out. The result is a high noise level. When I am in the mood to relax, this is not the place to enjoy eating out.     As long as the Galleria at Sunset has a mediocre selection of restaurants and I do not to play a real life game of Frogger risking life and limb visiting a nearby restaurant; I could return to the Panda if I am in the mall and hungry."}
{"text":"This is one of the Panda Express restaurants that I patronize in the Vegas fast food landscape. Four stars because I am a fan of Panda Express. This location lives up to their name.   Panda Express is no authentic Chinese restaurant, however it serves quality food. In my opinion, their chow mein noodles is tastier than those served in some of the Green Valley area Chinese restaurants. In comparison to some of the fast food chains, I don't feel like I'm eating fast food.  I have been and still am a Panda Express fan."}
{"text":"This is one more positive Panda Express experience. As a regular Panda Express customer, I realize that they are the Target of fast food places. Panda Express is a fast food restaurant with the ambiance of casual dining, at a price that is not much more than the burger places.   Today I tried their potato chicken. It is different.   Panda Express has one of the cutest mascots: Tom Tom the panda bear. This location features a neat display of the panda bears.    The employees are friendly. One of them was telling me about the panda bears display, and that some locations sell the stuffed panda bear    I was glad to see that they brought back the eggplant with tufu.   What I also enjoy about this Panda Express is that it shares a parking lot with Best Buy and Starbucks.     I give this Panda Express, and many other locations 4-stars."}
{"text":"The Green Valley Ranch Panda Express suffers from two flaws. Flaw 1: There is far better sit-down Chinese restaurants at comparable prices within a mile radius. They include New York Chinese Restaurant,  China Go Go, and China Tango. Flaw 2: Oftentimes this place suffers from one of the flaws of the Panda Express chain. This is the nearly empty and greasy food serving tray. This gives a very unfavorable impression and has resulted in me skipping over eating here a few times in the past.     The major strength of the Green Valley Ranch Panda Express has going for it is convenience. Green Valley Ranch is a hot spot of bars. People drink in bars and get buzzed to the point of not being able to safely operate a car. Panda Express is a decent option for this captive audience. It is also convenient for people who don't want to leave the casino or are going to the movies.    I used to be a fan of Panda Express. Yelp has enlightened me to all these Chinese restaurants that are better. I now see Panda Express as a fast food Chinese restaurant of convenience instead of worthy of a special trip.  The 2013 Yelp 200 Challenge. Review 109."}
{"text":"I dined here on the way to have my health card renewed.  As a regular fast food customer, I rate Panda Express highly. My three plate dinner including chow mein, kobari beef topped off with hot mustard, and fried rice was the bomb. And the portions of food was decent.   At the crossroads of Boulder Highway and Lake Mead Parkway (I-215 east of US 95) and near a Walmart Super Center, it was jumping. The abundant seating and pleasant environment did a good job of making me relaxed in a busy restaurant.    This visit to Panda Expressed got the job done. As I head into the monotony of having my health card renewed, I am now filled up and relaxed."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Panda Express. Just like the majority of Panda Express restaurants I have been to, the service was good. They filled up my plate (sometimes Panda Express does not fill up the plate). And the food was of the quality I expect from Panda Express.   The only negative is that it seems that they discontinued serving soup."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is in the Showcase Mall Food Court. From several experiences here, I have left the food court hungry because the seats are filled. There are too many people verses too few seats. Plus the lines are frequently lengthy.   This Panda Express has the ambiance of the Showcase Food Court, which is a loud upstairs room. The food is the normal Panda Express.    Expect to pay higher prices. For example a two entree dinner with a large beverage is nearly $2 more than off Strip Panda Expresses. Regardless all restautants are expensive on the Strip."}
{"text":"Crowded but the cashier lady is good women. She is polite and nice to customers. They are the only one who works till 2 am in the morning and it's life saver . Price is the same with all other pandas and no parking , you need to walk in or take taxi . Make sure you don't drive cuz it will take you hours to get from parking to here"}
{"text":"A young man named Ivan made my visit a great experience. He was quick yet patient, making sure as we went everything was coming out on time and fresh from cooks. He would definitely be a reason I would return. The communication between front line and cooks was phenomenal! I got half/half noodle/rice, bejeeng beef, orange & sweet fire chicken, veggie egg rolls and cream cheese puffs. Food all tasted great and for such a good price! Please don't change a thing at this location and give Ivan a raise, he has leadership potential."}
{"text":"Hot or miss food today got my order wrong and barely got any food so that always cool"}
{"text":"Didn't get greeted when we walked in and stood at the counter for five minutes before helped, and there was no line. Very RUDE and didn't even hand us our food."}
{"text":"Thought the service was great. Two of the three foods that I wanted ran out and was on the last scoop and Tasha was so nice and offered to get more right away! Thanks Tasha that was super cool."}
{"text":"This dive is supposed to be fast food, perfect when you're borderline hangry and need something quick. Not with the staff today. Ordered teriyaki chicken, sweet fire chicken, brown rice and veggies. The veggies and sweet fire chicken were ready and they said it would be a minute. So I got rung up and waited. 15-20 minutes passed as I am watching everyone get served. The veggies had been ready for a while. And I couldn't see the chicken refilled due to the constant line so I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that it wasn't ready yet. Well, li and behold, they're serving up other customers the same items I ordered and took the teriyaki sauce from my container and gave it to another guy. I walked up and asked for a refund. Without saying a word and simply a deer in the headlights look, they tried to scramble to finish my order and I told them making it now doesn't help anything, I need a refund. Then the woman (40-50s, Brunette, hair slicked back in a bun, no hat, wearing all black) who dropped the ball with my order to begin with says she can't do a refund, that it'll take a long time. So the gist is they can't serve ready-to-go food, can't communicate, don't know how to process transactions, and after all of that, still no food. And now I have to waste more of my day to dispute the charge since the staff couldn't be bothered with refunding the transaction. This location is terrible and I hope management helps in getting their act together. This experience was awful and I would not recommend to anyone based on the lack of competence and problem solving."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I'm sure there is a corporate guideline tgat regulates the amount of food that is to be served and nothing can be done about it. I enjoy the food. I really do. I just expect more food than what I'm getting. It makes me feel like the employees and owners do not care. Imagine that you are that one panda express location that is known for hearty portions when served.... You would have the more consistent business and better reviews. But again corporate guidelines prevent this. Or it may be employees that really just don't care. Thanks for your response."}
{"text":"PUT UP SOME GOOD WINDOW SHADES!  Brutal sun exposure at sunset a.k.a. dinner time.  The food was decent."}
{"text":"New stand-alone chain restaurant in Monroeville on William Penn Highway (US 22) where the Sunrise Inn stood before being demolished for this new building and parking lot.  It's clean, has plenty of parking, staff is friendly.  As with the other models for this chain, you go through a line, pick your items from the selection along the line, the staff places the items on your plate and you pay at the end of the line.    I chose a 2 item entrée with white rice -- angus beef and veggies and a spicy peanut/chicken dish.  Please note the smaller print on the white board -- the prices all state \"STARTING AT\".  I found that bit of a surprise and irritatingly so when the staff let me know that the angus beef was more than 1.00 extra from the \"Starting Price\".  I wonder what one gets for the \"Starting Price\".  Just a Customer Relations issue that comes across negative to me, the customer.  Just price each dish individually if that's how you're gonna play the game so there are no surprises to me, your customer.    Anyway, the visuals of the dishes are good -- very colorful and full of veggies.  The taste was decent, as well.  The price?  Eh, ok -- $12.18 total bill for 2 items, rice, and a medium drink.  And, it IS good to have a new option for fast-food dining in Monroeville."}
{"text":"So I arrived at the drive-through at 10:00 PM.. I ordered mixed vegetables and chow mein and was told they were out of vegetables.  The girl said she was sorry but they were starting to close down the kitchen and only had enough for maybe one bowl of chow mein and one bowl of rice no vegetables. I thought the place closed at 10:30 not 10 o'clock. WTF !!!  The only reason I go there is because they're the only place open after 10 o'clock which is when I get off of work. So much for that !!!"}
{"text":"Tonight the food was very fresh, and the store was packed.  Panda Express was donating proceeds to my son's school, and a let of people went.  Thus in one of my best visits to this location.  The associates were very nice even though they were swamped. As I mentioned before, the food was recently made and had good flavor."}
{"text":"It was ok... not as friendly as other locations. Fresh food instead of dried out chicken and shrimp so thats a plus... it's panda so nothing too special..."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, though they could have more spicy dishes that are still healthy and they should have cauliflower rice as a side option! It's a shame they don't keep any of the new dishes of the month because some of those are fantastic and should stay a bit longer!"}
{"text":"I had a decent experience here however there were a few rather annoying things that seem to always get me at Panda Express. First of all, the elusive rare broccoli beef; let me tell you if you ever walk into a Panda Express and they have any broccoli beef, I'd recommend going and buying a lottery ticket why your at it because finding ANY broccoli beef at Panda Express without \"just 5 minutes\" is ACTUALLY statistically impossible. They also had no chicken breast ready or teriyaki chicken. I can excuse the broccoli beef but I refuse to be denied teriyaki chicken at a Chinese restaurant. (even though the dish is actually Japanese (don't tell them that)) The chow mein was lack luster per usual at Panda Express and required liberal amounts of soy sauce in order to give it any taste. For my entries I settled for orange chicken, mushroom chicken, and teriyaki (you guessed it) chicken. The orange and mushroom chicken were divine. They were fresh and the mushroom chicken had a good balance of veggies; my complaint here is the mushrooms chicken had literally 1 mushroom in the whole serving. The teriyaki chicken was somewhat lukewarm but the molten lead they called the teriyaki sauce warmed it all up to a nice temperature. As for the service, the place was not busy at all, so come on; how hard could it be to keep everything stocked up when there is no one in the drive through and really no one in the dining room. The employees could possibly spend less time socializing and flirting with there coworkers and actually produce some food. (just an idea) I'm getting pretty tired of going in with my mind set on something only to see that 70% of what I planned on getting needs \"just 5 more minutes\". If I wanted to wait for my food I'd order take out from a real Chinese restaurant nearby; but I don't. I come to Panda EXPRESS to get EXPRESS service. Not to wait several minutes for my food. I'll cut them a break since there new, because I do understand an establishment needs to break in and get it's rhythm. If I return and experience an improved experience I will update my review. All in all, not a bad place to go and eat, but just runs a little clunky."}
{"text":"You know what, fancy-pants? When is the last time that you came to Panda Express, ate, and left saying to yourself \"Oh my god that is NOT what I was expecting, ugh, I wanna barfcakes all over\"? No. You haven't. You know why? Because Panda is JUST FINE. It is what it is, and you know exactly what you're getting yourself into. There are MUCH better options for Chinese nearby, and some crazily good authentic stuff that I'm sure readers of my reviews are intimately familiar with. But sometimes, you just want to swing by, grab a bit, and be on your merry way. This is FAST FOOD, people. And as far as fast food goes, it's fuckin' delicious. So get off your high horses, drink yourself into a good hangover, and go eat a big ol' meal here. THEN come at me with your two-star ratings.  Yeah. That's what I thought."}
{"text":"The food has definitely improved. More choices and better prepared. The management is friendly, the staff a little standoffish. Mostly a good experience."}
{"text":"Awesome night time manager she gave me a free drink while waiting for my food to be finished very thankful for that"}
{"text":"I came to this location to buy some egg flower soup.  The staff was very friendly and quick. I order my soup, paid for it and was out the door in under 2 mins.  I will definitely come back to this location again"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed going to Panda Express locations throughout the United States. But at this location you will not have the great friendly service as others. They do not honor veterans and become argumentative at the smallest comment. I wrote to their Corp hq and entered surveys for several months but nothing changed. We have vowed as a family to not go to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Where does all night/morning partying and drinking on an empty stomach get you? I'll tell you. It gets you up and ready to do it again the next day. Panda Express satisfied my craving for chow mein & garlic shrimp & honey walnut shrimp twice a day for the time I was in Vegas.   SOOOO yummy and fueled my system so that I could drink more alcohol."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express just as much as the next guy but this place is poorly ran. Always out of a lot of menu options and half the time the service stinks but the other half they are nice. I spoke with manager and it's evident where the problem lies. She is not at all friendly and just stares at you. I feel bad for the employees. She is quite the bad apple!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the same food you can get at every other Panda Express across the country - quick-serve Chinese.  Nothing wrong with it, but nothing grand either.  The good news is that it wasn't going to slow down our trip, nor was it going to set us back a ridiculous amount either."}
{"text":"I love panda! One of my faves! But this location is terrible. The employees and manager are never on the same page. For years I came here and they always give me military discount (which is nice). And then the Manager Min started working in the front. Certain employees still give me the discount however Min doesn't. Which is totally fine. But make up your mind and get on the same page as everyone else. There is one girl I don't know her name but she is ALWAYS RUDE. And when Min gives me my food he literally doesn't even fill my bowl up. It's always half way. And one time I told him something and he said it was more than enough. I still love Panda I just won't be returning to this one."}
{"text":"I went here for a bowl of rice and orange chicken and spent 20 minutes in line with two cars ahead of me.... that's a little long for some premade food."}
{"text":"This is probably the nicest panda I've been to, interior wise. I came here around 3 something on a Thursday afternoon. The place wasn't crowded, probably had 2 or 3 tables at most. There were probably 2 or 3 people working at that time. I don't think I was greeted when I came in & if I was, I didn't hear them. The girl who took my order didn't smile, just kinda went on with her shift taking people's orders.   I had a kid's meal & I felt like that was a good enough serving to fill me up. I had the sweet fire chicken breast & half & half of the chow mein & brown fried rice. The kid's meal comes with a fortune cookie, a chocolate chip cookie, & a small drink. I got the panda passion tea & thought it was sweetened... but it wasn't LOL. It was still good tho!   This is the closest panda to my work place so I'm pretty sure I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The good: The pot stickers tasted good, and I liked their 6 shrimp for $2.50. And the fortune cookies were edible.  The bad: Pretty much everything else.  The ugly: The fact I paid $22 for food that most of it ended up in a trash bag destined for the Apex landfill outside of town.   The next time I start thinking that Panda Express is worth visiting to satisfy my cravings for Chinese food in Henderson, I hope the karma gods smack me with a clue stick and wake me up.   2 stars. Why? I haven't got a clue except I don't want to write any 1 star reviews tonight. (It's the best I've got).   (Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #20)"}
{"text":"I am so sad to add panda to my list of places to avoid!! I just left there where I ordered the Shanghai steak which is promoted as the Healthy Wok item only to watch the cook throw my steak in the deep fryer! I complaint and was ignored and made to feel ridiculous for wanting my meat not deep fried! It is a shameful situation! The cashier wouldn't let me keep the receipt after I asked to cancel my order to prevent me from having the store number! I will be contacting pandas guest service!!"}
{"text":"Reviewed the reviews and agree that if you came here a year ago service was bad and food not as tasty as other locations. Today I was greeted with a smile and my bowl with chicken and fried rice was good. The place was clean. If I had my choice I would go to the Panda on Thompson Peak near Raintree, people are cool, even when the wait line is out the door. I've never encountered a long line at this place, which is good as a customer. The best thing about this location is the outdoor sitting and Starbucks next door, which was getting a renovation at the time I wrote this."}
{"text":"I only come here for rice and veggies  It's panda so nothing special not many vegetarian options or any actually and not many healthy options except the only thing I order. I love the price and the rice but I just wished they had tofu and other vegetable choices."}
{"text":"Okay I guess.   Just wished they had gluten-free options."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is fairly efficient and does a good job of keeping their line to a minimum most times. Brock is a young man that has served us a few times and he is friendly and efficient. Twice we've seen an older woman give him a bit of a hard time but we'd like to acknowledge that he seems to care about service and doing a good and thorough job. Hope he's being recognized for that."}
{"text":"We had a positive experience st this location. My ten year old loves Panda Express so we've visited a number of them. This one didn't have a long line on a Saturday night, which was a welcomed situation for us.   We were able to order immediately and take our food and run. Perfect! The service was friendly and the restaurant itself was clean. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"We had a positive experience at this Panda Express. The employees were efficient and friendly. The dining area was well maintained and clean. The silverware area was well stocked and the fountain drink area was clean. We didn't have to wait very long to be served and our order was filled accurately. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Our visit was a good one. There wasn't anyone in line when we got there so our order was immediately taken and filled. The young woman working the evening of January 7th wasn't overly friendly but she was efficient. The food itself was good and the restaurant was clean. Their outside sign was out so we nearly missed it since they are at the end of the strip mall. I'd suggest they fix that immediately. I can only imagine how much business that has cost them."}
{"text":"We have been here twice in two weeks and the food is very good. Nice portions, fresh food, served hot. The restaurant itself is clean and spacious although I'd like to see a little more attention given to the drink area where customers don't take great care in serving their own soft drinks and leave a sticky mess. Otherwise, no complaints about cleanliness or organization. The only thing keeping them from obtaining their fifth star is the speed of service. The line moves pretty slowly. Not exactly sure if that's the customers ahead of us who don't know what they want or what...but both times, it's been pretty slow getting from one end to the next.  Otherwise, no complaints. Good food. Friendly people. Nice environment."}
{"text":"Right before dinner and the food looks like it is from yesterday. To add insult to injury your workers are making jokes about how bad the food looks that they have to sell. Fresh is not in the vocabulary. Don't ask for fresh food either because they refuse to do that. Lousy workers did nothing but complain about how much they have to work and how much they hate their jobs. All their customers that come in on holidays are losers as they stated and those who come in at or near Christmas are nothing but a**holes per your staff on 8/31 at 421pm. Will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Just your average panda express.  The location is convenient. It has plenty of open tables since it shares the area with Subway and some other stores.  Food is much cheaper if you just want some quick food and fast service. However, if you are really hungry, better go across the street and spend just about the same amount of money at Monte Carlo buffett for more food and variety."}
{"text":"I rarely come here. Normally, it's busy when I do. But today, I was in and out in five minutes. I'm pretty impress with the customer service. They noticed me right away when I walked in through the door. She was helping another guest and told me she will be with me shortly. Then I see someone standing who looks like a manager or a chef.. Not sure, lol. I thought he was just going to look at me and walk away but nope. He asked if I was ready to order. And he took my order instead. I'm pretty sure they hired new people since the bad reviews. Anyways, food was great! As well as customer service. I ordered the shrimp walnut thingy and my favorite mushroom chicken and did a combo of fried rice and noodles. He put a lot on my plate. Sometimes Panda Express can be stingy with their food. Just like McDonalds and their sauce. But they started charging for those. Very irrelevant... Lol. But my review!!!(:"}
{"text":"Not really surprising that this location doesn't have any reviews. This is a new location they opened recently. I have been to this location twice. The first time, I went  to purchased food for both my dad, and I. I spent a little over 25 dollars for the both of us. This past week was my 2nd, and final visit. Unfortunately I wasn't actually able to eat during this visit. After I left a meeting, I wanted to get something to eat before I went home. I stopped to order some food Togo. Like always, you order down the line, and you pay on the opposite side. When I get to the Cashier, she asked \"May I get you anything else\", and I responded no thank you. It came time to pay. I had a wallet filled with cash, and credit cards. I pulled out a Target Visa gift card. I told the cashier I wasn't sure if it's balance, but there is still money left on the card. Then I asked, \"do you need to know the balance before you run the card\"? She relayed \"No\". \"The system will tell me what you owe, and what the balance is\". I thought great. Working in the restaurant industry myself, I know very well how tricky these cards can be if you are unaware of that full function on a variety of systems.  She proceed to swipe my care, as. Told me there was $7.69 on my card, You owe a dollar, and some change. When she preceded to put in the cash her system began to malfunction so she had to restart the transaction. Unfortunately, all credit cards work the same. Once you swipe a card weather a receipt is produced or not, there will be a pending hold on the credit card holders account for usually 48, and sometimes up to 10 business days. Once they rang me back up, off course my card declined. After both myself, and the cashier explained the situation to the supervisor, he kept telling there is no money on my card, and that there was nothing he could do. I called the credit card company in front of him to get the balance from the automated system, and informed him that the card balance is now 0 with a pending hold of $7.69. He again said there is nothing he could or would do. I explained just so you know there was money on the card, and now there is not. I said to him, that's not right. He said \"sorry about that\". I left, and began to drive away, and then I stopped to call the credit company again, but this time I talked to someone to confirm what I already knew. I returned to the store to inform the supervisor that the credit company said that my money was in fact being held by Panda Express, and they were the only ones to release my money. All I asked him for was the number to either corporate, or someone I can talk to to make sure I Greg my money back. He cause a bit of a seen, kind of making it bigger than what it was. He said I'd have to wait and talk to his manager after I waited for a while. He took my number, and said he would have his manger call me. No one ever called me. It's a bit concerning to me that he kept telling me that because no receipt came out of the machine, nothing was charged. The card was swipe, there will always be a hold, No matter what! If I ever said anything like that to a guest at my establishment I would probably be terminate seeing as the guest like I did could prove right then and there that wasn't accurate. I feel like he was listening to anything I said. This entire process believe it or not took up almost 2 hours of my day. The worst pay was I just went home, and never ate. Some of you are wonder why are you upset over 8 dollars. Honestly, I wasn't really upset the whole, but it is a bit absurd to think I walk into a place to eat, they take my money, and I got nothing in return. I was made to look like I was being irrational, when I fact the entire time, I was completely logical, and  methodical when explains the situation the the supervisor. I wasn't going to write a review, but his whole experience was to ridiculous to not bring to peoples attention. I believed panda could have easily fixed the situation, but the person in charge made the decision not to. I will not be back to this location. I honestly don't know if I see this location staying open long.   Response to your comment- There is no section for DM's that I have seen. If you message me, I will respond."}
{"text":"Yummy food and fast service. Clean atmosphere!will visit again when i go shopping around there very convenient location"}
{"text":"Very slow service, they will take their sweet time and offer samples when people don't ask for it when there is a long line of people waiting to order"}
{"text":"UNMOTIVATED WORKERS!! Such a poor establishment. The manager(s) should be ashamed. A Wednesday night, it's dinner time and they tell me and my husband that the drive thru is \"closed\" but we are more than welcome to come in. OK????? We waited 20 mins for our food. They were out of almost everything. Mind you, it was very slow; not many people there at all. My husband stood there waiting for our food to be \"made\". Enough workers in the back too. Panda EXPRESS???? Yeah right.  They also put what they did have for us in our containers so it could get cold. We went to our car and had to go back in because they forgot our crab Rangoon. My husband said they handed it to him with an attitude (of course) and said \"ohhhhhhh that's whose this was...\" UH YEAH. Someone ordered it and instead of finding the person who ordered AND PAID for it, they just let it sit there and worked around it. Also, I cannot stand workers who have attitudes. Leave it at home.  When ALL of the workers have nasty attitudes, then there's a problem!!!! Will not be back."}
{"text":"Well for us travelling from Asia, seeing a place like Panda Express is a bliss :) .. not that I do not enjoy the American food, I think it is absolutely lovely, but due to our perpetual love for spices and curries and chili .. the propensity to find that one place, during a long stay, goes on an exponential increase.  So, when you stroll across Panda Express, the hidden senses would wake up and wpuld unconditionally take your steps in there. Then, upon realizing the varieties of wok curries in there .. you would probably start calculating as how many times would you need to visit to finish those all up :D  Now, people might argue that they have eaten better food at such places and all but given this is a type of makeshift fast food Panda Express is quite impressive.  The wok tossed curries which aren't sweetish are absolutely lovely .. like firecracker chicken, chicken with string beans, broccoli beef, asparagus and meat and a few others.  We were 3 people .. went here twice thus were able to master more than a few dishes :) ..  Took a plate with 2 mains .. once .. covering most of the stuffs and loved them all. Probably the least favourite was the teriyaki chicken, it was a bit dry the first time but absolutely lovely the next.  And with their prices and occasional coupons (if you are charming enough to let them give you :P) the place is pure gold :) ..  And it is lovely to see how efficient the staff is .. I mean the girl behind the counter would serve for you .. take your bills .. if she is free would clean up the place .. mop the few things people carelessly throw around .. and what not..  Overall, I loved the place .. have heard that it is coming to India as well .. sure shot success here :)"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS. I used the drive-thru. Unfortunately they were out of the Shanghai Angus beef. They asked me to park in the Walmart parking lot. I waited for 15 minutes. Nothing. I went inside the store and went to the cash register to get a refund. And here she comes and said that this this was just cooked. very doubtful, she walked from her cash register at the take-out window and had the meal already prepared so she had it for a while. I will never go back. If I could give zero stars I would.  this does not deserve even a single star."}
{"text":"FINALLY EAST COAST PANDA!!! Just got one near me!! There is a NEW PE in Bayonne, NJ right over the bridge!!!! There is a brand new strip mall there with a Panda, a Sonic and a 5 guys!! Its the best parking lot in the world!! Its about a 10-15 minute ride from Staten Island. Went there tonight for a fun cheat meal. LOVE the orange chicken and beijing beef. Omg. Happy I dont have to wait until I go to Vegas now in the summer to get it. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stop in when I'm in the mood for quick and cheap Chinese. The food always tastes fresh...fresher than the family owned Chinese place down the street. The staff is always friendly. There are a ton of options to have as a side to you choice of meat...white rice, brown rice, chow mein, veggies. You can sample anything you want. They have an array of drinks and sides to complete tour meal."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda Express in the world!! My egg rolls were burnt to a crisp and so were my Crab Rangoon. Also I asked for no celery because of an allergy that my one of my children have and they put extra celery so my child could not eat the food and it was burnt as well. I would be ashamed of myself if I was the manager of this pig dry. The cooks that prepared the food should be fired because they let sub par food go out. I spent $42 and some change for slop I wouldn't feed a pig because it was so effin NASTY!!! The fast food workers think they need $15 an hour for the work that they do. That's B.S.!! I advise that people read this and never go to this place because you will get your order burned so bad that it's not edible, you'll get sick because of improper food handling, dirt particles on your food because it dropped on the floor, possible mucous on your food where the employees spit in our food and the owners and managers do not care about the quality of their food nor do they care about what their employees do to the food!!! AVOID THIS PLACE, IT WILL MAKE YOU SICK!!!!"}
{"text":"I think they have a Panda Express at every casino/mall in vegas now.  This one is no different.  Food is fake chinese - but tasty nonetheless!"}
{"text":"My experience with the drive through at Panda Express has always been excellent and this is my first time leaving a review. The food was still hot when I made my way back to the office, which is nice, as I do not often get a hot lunch when working. Also, the line was non-existent. From the time it took me to order and drive around, the lady was already holding my food out of the window. Usually I am worried that something was messed up or missing, but no, never at Panda Express. Not only that but my bag had a fork nicely wrapped around a few napkins and a really nice fortune to boot! \"You have natural grace and great consideration for others\". What a great message to receive during the middle of a hectic week! Thanks Panda!"}
{"text":"Why is it that everytime I come to this place at 930pm they can never offer me what I want because they are closing the kitchen at 10 o'clock. Ten!!! NOT 930!! It never fails!!!"}
{"text":"Great job by Julian and the Summerlin Panda Group, after a slight slip, they came back to provide super service and of course great food.....they deserve 7 out of 5 stars!  Super rebound!"}
{"text":"Panda Express goal I think is to feed the American masses, not the Asian community.  That's ok, it's pretty cheap for what you get and can feed me at least for two mealtimes.   With a drive -thru,  I can go get half and half noodles and fried rice and orange chicken within 5 minutes!     Staff has always been friendly while taking my orders and I've never have had issues with the food.  If you want a quick cheap tasty fast food meal that you can get broccoli and green beans in your meal, Panda Express will satisfy!"}
{"text":"I got a response that they wanted to look into this further, yet the website they gave me was bogus.  Boy this place just keeps getting better and better with it's \"customer service\" NOT!"}
{"text":"This Panda Express location opened this weekend. It took us until today, Sunday, to give it a try. Every one and their mother made the same choice. The drive thru line wrapped around the building. Unfortunately the way the property is designed you have to pretty much wait in the drive through line to reach the parking area which is in front of the building. AT&T had parking signs all over their parking lot stating only AT&T customers and employees could park there. We ended up parking in the extension lot of McDonald's parking lot.  Once we were inside the line was all of the way back to the bathrooms. The line moved quickly and no one seemed to be upset about the wait. The kitchen was struggling hard to keep the rice filled.  Our food was meh. The Beef and Broccoli tasted like it was all broccoli and no beef. There was beef but it didn't have any flavor. The teriyaki chicken was real chicken. They literally pull out a chicken breast that has a teriyaki glaze on it and slice it before putting it on your plate. They put teriyaki sauce over it. The peppered dish was not spicy but A LOT of pepper. The other beef dish was too spicy for me but the heat eater (my hubby) said that it was spicy but no flavor. Their veggies as a side is a great idea. They look fresh and taste fresh. The Honey Shrimp was a little crispy even though it was a little sticky. There is a $1.25 up charge for the shrimp but I thought it was worth it. The crab Rangoon was ok but not something I would order again. It was mostly cream cheese.  The restaurant was clean and the employees were very kind even though they were swamped. The bathroom was clean as well. When we left the line was still all of the way to the back of the restaurant. People were definitely ready to eat here. I would go if someone wanted to but it wouldn't be my first choice for Chinese."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's close to work, that being walking distance. The employee's have always been friendly, the place is clean, and the food is always hot and tasty. I really enjoy the pepper chicken, kung pao chicken, and the chicken with green beans and I always get a two item combo with fried rice. They have all you can drink self serve dispensers and some great iced tea! The cost is always under ten dollars for me and I find that they are pretty generous with the portions that they serve you."}
{"text":"They open at 10. I showed up at 10:30 and they still had nothing ready. I literally waited 30 minutes (because my gf wanted panda) for string bean chicken and mushroom chicken. It was ridiculous... A couple showed up after I arrived they ordered, ate and left and I was still waiting. Will not be back to this location because of the bad service. By he time I got home the rest of my food was cold and veggie rolls were soggy. I would give this 0 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is amazing food is good but lately they have been so rude, like i want eat there its good good job to the cooks but the people serving have strong attitude and don't know that a smile and putting the lucky cookie and the chop stick in the bag and offering sauce or a drink can go such long way it makes me feel like i should drive 4.8miles to another panda to eat!"}
{"text":"Horrible.   We are a fan of Panda. We went into this location and started ordering. My daughter ordered the Teriyaki Chicken. As the girl started cutting it, it was raw. She than pushed it over to the side, grabbed another piece and started cutting...with the same knife and cutting board. It too was raw... She started pushing it over AGAIN! I stopped her and said she needed to get a new cutting board and knife. The cook thought it was quite funny that the food was raw and was making comments under his breath.   She disappeared into the back. With said board and knife.   We walked out. Gross.   It gets better. While this was all happening, my other daughter had to use the restroom. While she was in there, someone was throwing up. Lovely."}
{"text":"What can I say...let me start by saying when I walk in a restaurant and see my meal on a steam table waiting for me I worry....will not be back...even my 8 year old son complained about the food quality"}
{"text":"I couldn't make this up if I wanted to. First off the service was horrible, not only did I wait a good 5 minutes to be serviced due to one person taking and ringing out orders but when the 2nd person who finally decided to come out from cleaning tables to help take orders she went to take the order of the people after me. (The lobby was empty with one customer dining in, I had one person in front of me). After I politely informed the 2nd associate I was next in line, I had to repeatedly inform her of my order when she kept mistakenly making it. Once I went to ring out she starting talking to the cook and literally held my receipt and debit card in her hand until after she finished talking to him not even apologizing. Needless to say I extremely annoyed by their service. I moved to Charlotte a few months ago from  Jacksonville, FL, the restaurant there had better service and tastier food. I hope they plan to reopen another one here in Charlotte since this is the last one open after the other 2 locations are closed. They could've gotten 4 starts but once again terrible service and okay food compared to others I've been to..."}
{"text":"Anna K was our cashier and was so pleasant and kind. She made sure to offer ways for us to save money like sharing and really cared for us. I hope when we return tomorrow she will be there so we can say hi to her. You have a great employee there."}
{"text":"It's Panda Express, starch, some kind of dead thing, sauce, possibly a vegetable mixed in. This one is no better or worse than any other."}
{"text":"Service beyond expectations!!! First of all.....This location is super clean inside and out.  Food was hot and freshly made and all the flavors you want and love from, Panda were all there!  It's always nice to be taken care of and given that little bit of extra acknowledgement. It goes a long way!  I forgot the name of the cook, but he noticed I went up to the register after having already made my purchase, and went out of his way To make sure I was helped. Things like that do not go unnoticed! Thanks again for awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh selection, fast staff, clean restaurant. Thumbs up in my book!"}
{"text":"Ordered today online for pickup. They moved my pick up time back 30 minutes because it was a larger order. Upon pickup the food was not prepared yet. I had to wait as they served everyone in line and then they finally made my food. So don't order online, they don't make it in advance. It's quicker to just order inside. Also, staff is dismissive and clearly overworked so they came off rude."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. Not only are the 2 girls paying more attention to the guinea pig that some Petsmart employees brought in, which is disgusting!. They took it out of the box!.. She also messed up my order and then also forced me to scan my card  twice cuz she forgot my soda.. It is 2:22 pm Sunday May 27"}
{"text":"Come here a lot. Usually better service. Didn't have any teriyaki chicken and had to wait for them to cook it.  Same time line is building up. Manager and employee on break couldn't be bothered to help out from their break. Cash Machine jams up and other employee gets a phone call making no one helping anyone     Not having the dish available was only a small part of service problems listed above"}
{"text":"Mexican girl kept being rude, rushing us when there was no line, and getting a big attitude when we tried to ask a question about getting a big plate or not, asking if it's easier to do that. I know people get frustrated for working at places for a long time, or are just frustrated in general... but they don't have to take it out on the customers. I work in the same field but at least I respect."}
{"text":"I went against all the negative reviews and found this place to be great. Service was very helpful, price was right and food was delicious."}
{"text":"Of the three times I have gone there in the last two weeks it has been a terrible experience. They are always out of at least 5 or 6 items at a time. They say they will not be filled and this is around 8 to 8:30 pm or will take more than 15 minutes. When I pull up there is always 3-4 of the kitchen staff just sitting at the tables. The tables are always dirty and the floor as well. The management needs to do a better job scheduling to keep the items in stock. The line bar has food all over the place from where they are filling the orders. The portions, taste, and prices are reasonable but the rest no so much"}
{"text":"Had lunch with two of my friends on 3/13/14 at this location at 3:30pm  Two of us including myself got incredibly sick. We are in town for business. After our meal little did we know that the next 36hrs we would both experience the worst episode of sickness in our lives.  We are middle aged men.  It was the food and we are NOT happy about this.  I am simply notifying the restaurant and consumers for their safety."}
{"text":"Pour changer un peu des fastfood traditionnel de burger, le panda express sera un très bon choix ! C'est super bon et bien copieux ! A conseiller !"}
{"text":"Okay so this is extremely ridiculous I want to Panda Express inside palms for like the 4th time maybe even the 10th time of my life and our plates look drastically empty like there's hardly any rice hardly any chowmein hardly any meat and it just looks terrible like as if it's been sitting for days and they just reheated it I literally went to Panda Express not even 30 minutes ago just got back to my house and as in the pictures that I'm about to post you can see for yourself This is BS I paid $23 for Two Plates and this is what I got if I was you I would choose a different Panda Express location"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my visit to this Panda Express! I have tried multiple locations, and have had some not so good experiences. The Kung pow chicken here is the best I've had at this chain so far. It was very spicy and they used quality chicken (some of the other locations use pieces of chicken that are very chewy). I also tried the sweet fire chicken. It was fresh and very tasty as well.  Cream cheese Rangoon's were crispy and hot. I will definitely visit this location again!"}
{"text":"I've had many good experiences at this location. The staff is friendly and the food is fresh. Also the service is prompt even when it's been busy."}
{"text":"A great location on the corner of Flamingo & Pecos. This store is clean and the staff is friendly. The food is on-par with the other Panda restaurants. Try the Panda bowl with white or brown rice- a nice alternative to the large 2 portion meals. Sweet fire chicken- sticky and yummy!!"}
{"text":"Where do we eat before we head out 4 hours on the I-15 back home?  The food court is close by so we decide it'll be quick and convenient.  It's open 24 hours but choices are limited.  You can get pizza, Subway, Del Taco, hot dogs, or Panda Express.  The Panda Express on someone else's plate looked good so we went with that.  Panda Express is like any other Panda Express establishment but this reminded me somewhat of a military boot camp cafeteria.  I asked for the half chow mein, half fried rice with black pepper chicken and the guy behind the counter repeated my order twice scooped it out fast, tossed it down and yelled \"next!\" He gave me steamed rice instead of fried rice and by the time I went to correct it he had an angry look on his face and was trying to move the line along so I decided to stay with my rice.  They had a promo at this location.  If you got the monster drink, you also get these sugared wonton crisps.  We went for it but the drink was too much to handle considering I only drink enough to cover my meal.  The meal itself was ok.  I guess the black pepper chicken is considered healthy and listed on their \"smart wok\" menu.  Good to know if I'm craving Panda Express again but I'm usually not."}
{"text":"My daughter purchased a meal it was very greasy.  We returned the meal and I spoke with a Tammy (The manger) how bad it was.   She told me I needed to tease it before leaving the store.  Wow!! I believe it is their responsibility to assure the meals are perfect before the customers receive it.  She offered a store credit instead of refunding my money.  Why would I support a company who doesn't give great customer service along with servicing bad food too.. We should had checked out Yelp before going there.  This store is located in Gilbert on Warren & Gilbert."}
{"text":"Orange chicken is pretty good. The noodles have potential to be very good;however, they lack consistency. Sometimes they are overdone, most not fresh, sometimes burnt, dry etc. Don't order them if they are not freshly made."}
{"text":"Well let's say this resturant is inconsistant, food sometimes is hot, other times it is cold.  Portions are very inconsistant.  Most of the time the place is dirty because staff makes little effort to keep it clean & tidy.  Couple of weeks ago I made the mistake of paying for my meal by credit card.  Girl forget to give me receipt.  I went back & got the receipt, and realized I was over charged approx. $5.00.  Trying to find a manager who could reverse the over charge was a pain.  Apprently location manager was away.  Finally over charge was corrected.  I called the companies corporate office in California.  Was promised a call back by the manager or area manager over this fiasco.  Two weeks has gone by and never got a call.  Best advise is avoid this Panda location as they just do not care or value customer patronage."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 plates with 3 entrees each and were disappointed in the portion size and attitude of server. Usually the staff is very friendly, but the server we got was very impatient, and rushed me to order. Very annoying! There was a small amount of chicken in one pan and instead of serving us the full amount, she made sure to give on spoonful and not a bite more (other Panda restaurants would have offered the whole portion since there wasn't much left). When it came to another entree, the server basically only scooped up the veggies. When my mom asked her about it, she simply held the plate up in the air! She did not offer to reserve the portion. When we got home & put it on a plate, we literally saw that there was only ONE piece of chicken and the rest was green beans! Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Panda Express.  With that being said, I did not appreciate the service I received from this establishment.  When it came time for us to order, they had run out of mixed veggies and told us that it would be 2-3 minutes before another batch.  We were fine with waiting,and asked if he wanted to continue with our order - which the employee told us fine in a faint voice.  I told him what I would like, so did my son, and his father.  We then waited at that cashier, not sure what else to do - as people went around us.  Finally, they completed and didn't ask us if we wanted any extras - crab puffs, spring rolls,etc.  We had to stop another person from placing our food into a bag.  We got our add ons,  and then she starts placing our items into a bag - which this time we had to tell her that we were eating in their establishment and weren't asked that question when being served by her male co worker.    I had to ask for chili sauce and mustard, which meant that I had to hold up the line for the second time.  We sit down only to discover that my order was incorrect, and I was given Kung Pao Chicken instead of mushroom chicken.  Thank goodness I can hand the spice or I would have to wait again for my meal to be completed.  After reading the other reviews, it sounds like people need to be retrained on taking orders, and projecting their voices."}
{"text":"First and foremost the parking sucks!  Make sure not to go at rush hour (between 5-6p) as there's hardly any room to form a line inside.  This is the reason why I gave it a 4 star.    On a good note, this place is visible and easy to find.  The food was fresh and delicious.  All thanks to them Hispanic cooks,  which amazes me every single time since this is an Asian restaurant.     Even though the line was almost out the door,  it moved pretty quick.  They're always quick to offer samples and load it up with food if you order a to go meal.   Other than that Bon Appétit!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really one to typically rate chains but my experience at this Panda Express was so poor that I couldn't stop myself. We'd been traveling for about 6 hours by the time we pulled up to this restaurant. We were all hungry and a little bit edgy (family of 4) but anxious for something to satisfy us. We don't eat a lot of traditional fast food, and when I saw a Panda Express sign I was thankful we could end up somewhere we all like and agree on.   The food was waaaaaaaaaaaay sub par and the portions borderline unacceptable. There were no people in line before or after us and all the little food bins were virtually empty. I appreciated that they offered to cook 2 of our orders up fresh, but when we received them it was about 1/4 cup of each item, if not less - and the veggies were too crisp (raw) to even bite into them. We expected to at least be able to eat the rice and noodles, and both of them tasted oily and undercooked. No bueno.  The staff wasn't rude, but certainly wasn't friendly. We typically like the Panda Express stores near us but unfortunately this experience was bad enough that I think it will be a long while before we visit any others."}
{"text":"Now I understand this isn't gourmet Chinese, but it also isn't the place with the golden arches either.. I expect the service and quality to be a smidge better than what I received. I've been here before and it's been better. This visit there were slim pickens.. One entree wasn't even available, I was told it would be five minutes. I'm no restaurant expert, but shouldn't you get things ready to replace well before you run out? So my second choice was my usual sweet fire chicken..sweet with a little kick. I always enjoy the pineapple chunks but didn't get even one this time..sad face.. I ordered the cream cheese rangoon, unfortunately it was way over cooked but my dog didn't mind! There was one person in front of me and it took as long as if there were 12. I'm sure I'll give them another chance, but not too soon.."}
{"text":"The food was warm even though I asked if the food was fresh and hot, they just said yes. By the time I walked to my car and tasted it. It was just warm and the rice was a little hard. I was on my lunch so I wasn't able to walk back in there and get a refund"}
{"text":"Avoid the drive thru at all costs - unless you have 20 mins to wait for sub-par Chinese food.  And don't expect a \"Sorry for your wait\"."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, the manager was rude and unfriendly. The manager treated me as it was my first time going there. Also, the walnut shrimp I ordered tasted horrible. Never going to panda again."}
{"text":"That's it I'm done with this place. I get it it's fast food but sometimes you just don't feel like cooking.  see when you go somewhere and pay $20 for two meals you expect somewhat of good quality but this place is garbage the workers are garbage food is garbage and I will never return to Panda Express. I got green bean chicken which we had to wait for to be made fresh but come to find out it was made fresh with pieces of fat and broken pieces of meat and no big pieces of chicken it was all slurry. I could've went to the store and bought four packages of chicken plus vegetables and rice and noodles for $20 and had enough food to last me for the next week."}
{"text":"Came in on Memorial Day, maybe 10 mins before they're early closing time (seems me and everyone else there didn't realize close was 8:30pm for the Holiday, which I get). Why is it that every Panda Express refuses to make more of something when they run out near close? Ran out of Teriyaki chicken and the lady at the drive thru was so rude! Wanted a plate, settled for a bowl, got ripped off like hell. Right amount of orange chicken but hardly any low mein. CMON PANDA! We believe in you."}
{"text":"Panda Express is.. well, Panda Express. The food here is exactly what you expect. Of course there is the extra charge for the \"premium side\" like all other locations. This particular location though, has an updated decor and a tea bar!  The decor has a modern-contemporary flair which was really nice. They also have a Panda Tea Bar that serves drinks just like a boba tea shop.   I gave it a try and for my usual which was an Almond Milk Green Tea with Honey Boba. Boba was made perfectly! Soft and chewy. The drink, however, was really sweet!! It was good but way too sweet. They need to take it easy on the sugar."}
{"text":"Staff is great, but this location is always out of things and customers always get upset because of the wait. Not sure if incompetence, or if waiting until food runs out before making more is the Panda protocol?"}
{"text":"Not \"Chinese food\". Just same things fried in same sauce. Will never go unless Iam stuck in the mall and hungry"}
{"text":"I have reservations about dirty tables and floors and food that is not at the proper temperature and this Panda Express had all those characteristics when I visited."}
{"text":"Always good food at a fair price. If you do their survey you get a free side! I usually get the 3 sides and have enough for 2 1/2-3 meals at around $9. More of a cafeteria style than a restaurant. Workers always friendly and quick to give you samples. My favorite Chinese restaurant in Surprise, with out a doubt. If it was good enough for my ex., who is pretty fussy, it's good enough for me. lol"}
{"text":"I love that they have fresh veggies, the green beans are my favorite. I tried the Honey Sesame Chicken, it's very good but unfortunately only available for a limited time. Besides that I usually just go for the orange chicken and fried shrimp. And a few locations have added a drive thru to it which is great."}
{"text":"Another Great Dinner From Panda Express!!   Food selection was great! Food was HOT! Store was CLEAN and staff was FRIENDLY !!   Manager Daniel was hands on serving up food with a smile and the staff was awesome tonight!!  5 star service, 5 star freshness on food, Highly recommend this location!! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding!!   When we were here it was super busy! I must admit I was impressed with ALL of the workers, from the cooks keeping the food coming and looking amazing, to the servers preparing our to go boxes  filling our containers.   The broccoli was so green and firm and the beef was cooked perfectly as well. We all were quite pleased with all of our different dishes. :)  This location was super clean and the food was very FRESH and packed with deliciousness!  :)  If you are looking for a good Panda Express I definitely would recommend this location! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Never go to this Panda Express.  I've never waited this long at a drive thru in any other panda. I thought it would change after a year but still the same you wait 20 min. I called and the lady was rude!!!! Wish I would have gotten her name! Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Panda Express and I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though they were pretty busy the place was very clean and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed - much more enjoyable than your typical fast food experience.  The staff working the line were very polite, friendly, and efficient!  I also like the 'plate' concept they use - pick a side, then pick 2 or 3 entrees.  (When I go to an authentic Chinese restaurant I can never decide on just one thing to order!)  The Orange Chicken and Beijing Beef were delicious, although the Fried Rice disappointed me - the rice was undercooked and was pretty much flavorless overall.  We loved their hot chili sauce - it had a great flavor and was actually spicy enough to satisfy us! ;)  Keep in mind this is still fast food- so if you're looking for a place with authentic cuisine I'd try somewhere else.  Great in a pinch though - we'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was meeting family for a small lunch at a local park. I was running errands so I placed an online order. I ordered the bigger plate with Kung pao chicken, Beijing beef and broccoli beef. I also ordered two side chicken egg rolls. When I arrived at the restaurant I went to the online order pickup. It was about 10 minutes past the pick up time for the order and it wasn't completed. They had to make one of the sides for the order. I waited and in about 10 minutes they handed me my order and I left. When I got to the park I began setting up the food. I opened the big to go box and noticed there are only two kinds of sides. The chicken and being beef. Th broccoli beef was no where to be seen. I checked through the bag again and there was nothing. I love Panda Express and that is why I chose them over other fast foods. The park lunch wasn't as relaxing after this incident. I am very disappointed in this establishment and will think twice before ordering here again."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express so I was happy to see it pop up here. Unfortunately, the three attempts at eating here, something went wrong every time. But what else should I expect from a restaurant in Cedar Center?"}
{"text":"You're going to have a terrible customer experience here. I guarantee it. I have been going for years. The food is exactly what you would expect, don't worry about that. Just look very sorry as soon as you enter the door and you may live, because they hate you. All of you. Do not catch their eyes or you will feel it searing into you.   Having said that, I toddled up to the counter today and the employee looked me right in the eye, smiled and said 'Hi, how can I help you'. I got a little excited and started 'Hi, I'd like a plate....'. And it happened. That smile crinkled into the frown of hatred. She pointed at me, at her headset, at the drive through and moved on. That smile wasn't for me at all. It was for the anticipation of fooling me.   I replaced my tray and walked over to Rubios for some tacos, and a smile."}
{"text":"The food is alright, agree with others very bland on the noodles and rice. I got mushroom chicken and the mushrooms we not cooked at all, still cold. The employees are beyond RUDE!!!!!!!! It's always the same young Asian man and older Asian woman. Not sure if it's a cultural thing but they are FLAT OUT RUDE! I have given them chance after chance and now I won't return. Too many other options to put up with their BS."}
{"text":"I love this location. I come here when my craving for sweet fire chicken and orange chicken gets far too strong to ignore. My kids love the fried rice and chow mein and can usually slam a 2 entree (sometimes 3) leaving us with scraps. Now tat they're older they eat so much more. So I have to usually order the 3 entree option.   I love the walnut shrimp, Beijing beef, beef & broccoli, orange chicken, egg rolls, fortune cookies and most importantly the service. I'm lucky enough to have the manager Dejah ring me up this visit and my last. I was honestly hoping she would be here today because I remember my last visit was so memorable. I sampled everything (or so it felt) until I found something new to indulge in. It was fairly slow last visit so it was nice getting one on one time and hearing her recommendations.   Dejah is definitely doing the customer service thing above and beyond! She's the type of gal to stop mid-order to say 'Bless You!' To another patron! I am ALL FOR MANNERS!! she's definitely another reason I come to this location. She's taking orders, keeping the chefs in the loop, cleaning the dining room and getting to know her guests. I know she's leading her team to greatness. Hopefully she sees this and it brightens her day like she did mine."}
{"text":"Waited till my 5th visit to review.  Don't get all bad reviews? It's a fast food place.  As expected!  What impresses me is they are always busy and clean!  My kids love the orange chicken.  If course, they are kids."}
{"text":"Typical chain location. MINIMAL customer service, tiny portions. Panda Express is getting worse as a chain. Portions are small and full of \"filler\" like diced potatoes so you get very little meat wise and YOU GET NOTHING THAT EVEN RESEMBLES THE PHOTO ADVERTISING THE PRODUCT. Too EXPENSIVE for what you get. Won't be back."}
{"text":"In for an early lunch. Restaurant was clean & employees were polite, but seemed incapable of producing a smile."}
{"text":"Service sucks, tiny portions, WAY OVER PRICED! Will not return."}
{"text":"The other reviews are spot on. If you're gonna spend that much time waiting on food you should just go to Pei wei. NOTHING was ready. 6 minute wait just for the chow mein. Everyone in front of me had to wait for everything to be made also."}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express I have ever been to.  The service is horrible.  The people that work at this location are very rude.  They make you wait forever for the food to be prepared if they have run out of what you want.  Never again.  I would rather drive further to a better location."}
{"text":"Quality has gone down.  Vegetables not adequately cooked and tasteless.  Last order the food looked like it sat too long under a heating lamp."}
{"text":"Im going to start off by saying my family loves panda. But ever since we moved to this side of town and had panda at this location something is always wrong with our food. I made it a point to stop coming to this location and just take the time to go to the one thats alittle further on decatur and charleston. But today i decided we would try again and i wasnt impressed.  The server was helping a someone ahead of me and the first thing i didnt like was  when the customer changed her mind on the food she had served, the employee thought it was ok to just put the food back into every tray that it originally came from. How is this okay??? People can be alergic to certain things and she just thought it was okay to do this even if the food had already been in one plate together.  Second thing is of cours being a regular panda customer i knew exactly what i was going to order. One of my plates included half and half fried rice and chow mein. One the fried ricehad dark pieces in it and smelled burnt. Second was the chicken string bean and orange chicken. Orange chicken was okay but the chicken string bean wasnt all that pleasant this dish aswell had the burnt pieces all around the chicken.  The 2nd and 3rd dish ended up both veing teriyaki chicken and orange chicken since what i was originally going to get looked horrible!That being the beef and broccoli. The broccoli looked old and the juice it was sitting in just looked nasty! I will never come to this panda again!"}
{"text":"Clean location, friendly service, and the food is always great. No complaints and I come here often!"}
{"text":"Downtown Summerland location. went in to get dinner at around 5:30pm on Tuesday and they Did not have hardly any food available. the food that was in the case was old and dried out. A mostly empty case that should have been full and ready to sell. We left and went to our regular location."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch today when there was a power outage. As soon as myself and friend sat down to eat our food it went down, which I understand is absolutely out of their control! What I  am totally upset with is all of the employees gathered in the dining room with 3 tables still eating and began to take a break I guess. They all sat around talking loudly, laughing and joking to the point where I could not even hear the conversation with my friend who sat across from me! As it began to get hot in there we were trying to quickly finish up as we clearly felt unwanted, I then noticed one of the workers eating straight off the line! I get that food will need to be disposed of anyways but c'mon so gross! Will not be going back there EVER and I hope they train the employees customer service in every situation!"}
{"text":"Based on yelp I am trying this 4 star Panda Express.  This is my first time eating at Panda Express.  I ordered the Beijing Beef and Teriyaki Chicken it was delicious"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with panda. Good, friendly, fast service. Food was good, went during lunch time and ordered quickly, and was outta there. Great portions too and the inside is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience! All hot and fresh food. Portions were excellent, and staff was very friendly and attentive. Lobby and line were a little dirty, but from someone working in the restaurant industry, I understand the struggle of trying to keep that clean! Thank you for the wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Normally i love eating at panda, but today's experience may change that. My boyfriend and I decided to stop here for lunch today and we're ordering a plate as we usually do to split. When asked what we would like my boyfriend said \"orange chicken. And chow mien please\" Marlada, the girl taking our order then asked if we would like chow mien or fried rice. We repeated chow mien. She then started to scoop string beans onto our plate after our chow mien and I kindly stopped her, telling her we had asked for orange chicken. She got mad and insisted we said string beans and continued to scoop it on our plate. My boyfriend then told her again what he had ordered and that we hadn't asked for string beans at all. She was very aggravated and refused to take the string beans off the plate until one of the older women working there came over and said something quietly to her in her ear. Marlada then proceeded to scoop off the string beans and indignantly put orange chicken on our plate. She was giving us nasty glares the entire time we finished our order and payed. I understand if someone misheard the order, but I would expect them to ask for clarification and to apologize wen they make a mistake. I know it's hard working in fast food, but that is no excuse for this behavior. I am better off spending my money at chick fil a across the street where I am insured proper customer care every time I visit. This is unacceptable and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food here can be classified as fast food Asian.  The chain seems to be growing by leaps and bounds as they are popping up everywhere.   The downside to this location is staffing. It is rare to get in and out of the drive through in under 10-15 minutes and my last visit was the longest topping off at least 35. From time of entering the drive thru it took minimally 10 minutes to get to the order speaker. Then another 5-8 for the woman on the speaker to take my order. She was thoroughly confused and unable to answer simple menu questions. I was alerted that 2 of the menu items  Once my order was placed I was asked to pull around to wait 8 minutes. The 8 turned to 15 and you get the picture.  Great news! The manager came out to apologize and offer up a courtesy order of egg rolls when I explained I had already ordered egg rolls he offered to remove the cost from my bill.. offer excepted! A few minutes later he returned with my order and a wonderful surprise he took the entire order off y charge card and I received the order for free. I couldn't have been happier.  I had ordered the family feast. It says it will feen 3-4, but if you have big eaters order an extra meal. Food is good but prepare food a wait and if you don't have to, even better. My favorites: pepper chicken, teriyaki chicken, Shanghai beef, orange chicken. Fried rice is good too."}
{"text":"Very good customer service.  The line was continually long, but moved quickly.  I do believe this was the best customer service I have ever received at a Panda Express.  The gentleman was smiling a friendly, happy smile.  Also, we didn't have to wait for them to cook orange chicken like you do at most other locations."}
{"text":"3 cars in the drive thru all of asked to park and wait for our order.    Never in my life have I been asked to park at any Panda Express!   Will not come back to this chaos.  BTW people, I ordered ONE, yes only one single combo!"}
{"text":"Always good. The Beijing Beef never gets old. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I usually love Panda Express but this location isn't the best. I wanted to take my fiancé who has never had Panda Express so that I could get him on board  however the service wasn't the best. The employees were to busy joking around to pay attention to their customers but that is not the worst part... The orange chicken was so overdone that it was unbearably crispy!!! I will say that this location is super clean so that was a plus!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times since they opened. I'm excited to report they've finally stopped over cooking(burning) most of the food. But unfortunately their broccoli to beef ratio has gone up & now there is barely any beef in The broccoli beef now. I'm not ready to give up hope just yet & we'll be back soon. Fingers crossed they keep getting better & they don't fail us!"}
{"text":"My husband went to get us dinner and when he got home was missing my sons order, which was a bowl. He was charged for it on the receipt. I used to work fast food, it's not hard to give people all of their food! And of course, just like everyone else said, no answer when I tried calling them about it."}
{"text":"The food court offers a great selection for a casino. Panda Express and Orange Chicken is always a favorite. The food was as fresh and hot. Not crazy about an $11.00 lunch but it is Vegas."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was hard and stale, teriyaki chicken was burned, I spent 30 bucks to get disappointed. I asked for 4 fortune cookies I got none. Not planning on returning here rather go to the one on Stephanie"}
{"text":"The rice and chow mein did not have any flavor.  I asked for soy sauce and they said they didn't have any.  How can you eat Panda without soy sauce?  I wasn't a happy camper but maybe next time I try they will have soy sauce."}
{"text":"I've never had quick service even on a Thursday night. And they're skimpy on the portions unless my husband is the one ordering. :/"}
{"text":"gotta say so far have been here a couple times and every time the staff is always friendly only complaint is this last visit they messed up a side on my order but it was extremely busy so cant be too upset i guess seeing as they seemed very understaffed and overwhelmed but staff wise they have always been super friendly and greet ect!"}
{"text":"I can't eat gluten anymore so while I used to eat here......now I go for other people who live with me!  It's good, fast and convenient food.  This location is always fresh because it's so busy.  The staff is great and they make Chinese take out less of a chore!  It's all good."}
{"text":"I will honestly never go to this location to eat panda anymore, the customer service sucks and they are rude. I wanted to get a bowl with two different chickens but not the full amount.. Just half and half so the price would stay the same.. And they were like no you can't do that it's a extra charge.. I was like okay.. I'll take the extra charge not thinking it would be a lot.. When I went to check out the order was 4$ more then I would normally pay! I was so upset.. And they were just like we can't do anything after I made a big scene I just paid for the food.. Worst customer service I have ever had. They are not understanding."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I just got food poisoning from there. It was the only thing I had to eat. BEWARE"}
{"text":"For Las Vegas, this place has pretty good price if you want a quick and cheap meal during the day. The quality of the chinese food there was typical chinese fast food quality. I got their chow mein with broccoli beef and angus beef steaks. The meats themselves were a little too salty for my liking but it blended well with the chow mein.   I also got the Thai milk tea boba and it was terrible. It had a very watered down flavour and the boba was really hard. They also overload the drink with too much ice and made the flavour even more watered down. I decide to give it 3 stars still since they aren't supposed to be known for boba and their food was alright."}
{"text":"I was told yesterday that they do not honor military discounts. Although, in the past they have given a slight discount to me for the past three years. The young lady at the register said they have never honored military discounts. I guess I just made it up for the past three years. :("}
{"text":"This is my 1st time at this location. And 5 stars with mistakes but still 5 stars. That right there tells you something. Service May & Angel very polite & great at interacting with the customers. I believe May over charged me which i looked at receipt no big deal I'll take the 2nd chicken egg roll i dont really need because i eat like a pig already lol. Food all items looked very fresh... I ate sweet fire beijing beef & honey seasame with half rice half chow main all fresh & delicious. The cooks mostly with there back turn because of busy business but they looked older but who cares right as long as they're doing there job good. Overall i will be back i live Panda & love coming to place that just shines. Actual size of place a little smaller than some out here in Vegas but doesn't matter. Keep up the good work PANDA TEAM! :)"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE PLACE. THEY AHOULD HAVE CLOSED AIGNS AND NOT BE RUDE TO CUSTOMERS. I will never come here again. Got stuck in line after they closed and the lady said, \"you should have looked online stupid\". WTH!?"}
{"text":"Who can abstain from visiting Panda Express every now and again?  Most people, but not me.  I need my Chinese food fix every few weeks.  And no other place fills that craving better than Panda Express because there just don't seem to be any other descent Chinese restaurants.  Most Chinese restaurants in Phoenix are terrible with a capital \"s\", \"u\", \"c\", \"k\", \"s\".  Panda Express fills the void by offering descent, fast food fare with easy to order combinations.  The Kung Pao actually comes with chili peppers making it spicy and there aren't those large flat misshaped pieces of meat loosely referred to as chicken.  And who doesn't love pandas?  I get the up sale every time just in case the two option plate isn't going to be enough that day.  Or maybe I've just grown too thin like most Americans.  In any case, if you find yourself in Phoenix and that dilapidated Chinese restaurant store front staring you down doesn't look inviting, Panda Express is always just around the corner."}
{"text":"This Panda Express has a drive throw. They are fast and friendly I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't trust these reviews! People are very high maintenance my goodness! I have been going here for over 5 years, the food is always good and hot, plus they will make anything fresh you ask for. The line can be long sometimes yes, but have never waited overly long."}
{"text":"OK, I like eating here.  Sometimes, I need a Chinese food fix, and this place is close to my apartment, so I stop in to get Chinese.  Panda Express is the fast food of Chinese, and honestly, its not half bad.  This location is actually one of the nicer ones I've been to, which is an added bonus.  I like it here because they have a nice selection of dishes, and I can walk in and order just about anything.  They let you sample dishes if your not sure your going to like it, which is nice.  Colorful interior, reasonable prices, and you get quite a bit of food and its actually kinda good.    The downside, is well, I guess part of the territory.  Every time I come here there's a line.  Sometimes its one or two people, other times its like 9 or 10.  If your starving, that seems like a long line!  (maybe I shouldn't wait so long to feed myself.  LOL)  Service speed is okay, nothing to complain about.  Tables are always clean, supplies are well stocked.  Parking is tight here.  There's a few spots, but the lot also doubles as the drive thru line, which BLOWS.  Why? If it's busy, you get blocked in by drive through people, and it takes forever to get out.  Why they did it like this makes no sense to me.  Also, they do not serve crab Rangoon.  I am baffled by this.  They have cheese Rangoon, but NEVER crab.  I prefer crab! I know, I know, my problem and not theirs.  I've never done the drive through, but overall this place is not bad at all!  It beats McDonald's and Taco Bell, though slightly more expensive, comparatively speaking.  Plus, if you suddenly crave Chinese but don't trust the Chinese restaurants around you (like me) then this place is a safe bet!"}
{"text":"Walked in and noticed all the tables dirty while 4 guy employees lounge around eating food. Girls in the back where flirting through their headset. Water on the floor with no caution sign. Does not look like there is any supervisor, if there is that person is doing a horrible job. Me and my family where standing up front and no one said anything to us for a while. We've been waiting for our  food for 30 minutes now because nothing is ready."}
{"text":"went here a couple of weeks ago i didnt realize one was added in old town which is a plus the line was pretty long when i went in which caused the honey walnut shrimp to be out when i reached the counter but this is why i give 5 stars the girl told me if you really want it its a 5 minute wait so i sat down and waited about 2-3 mins and she made me a priority when it became available which kinda surprised i will definitely return food is also good btw only thing i dont like are the egg rolls no biggie though go in and enjoy some panda"}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this Panda Express (three times) something goes wrong. Whether they give me the wrong items or completely forget items in my order in the drive thru. I don't always have the time to wait longer or walk inside afterward to correct the order. The food is sloppily thrown in the containers so everything is mostly mixed together. The to go boxes are usually greasy or sticky in the bags and the food is usually barely warm. Today is definitely is the last time I'll visit this location, again they forgot a side order that I was charged for. Unfortunately at didn't notice until I got home. Tonight I'll dream of those cheese rangoons that got away."}
{"text":"I hate leaving negative reviews. Especially when the staff here is extremely friendly and the food... when it's available is right in line with what you should expect from Panda Express (good to me). The dining area is typically kept pretty clean and there's plenty of parking.   Unfortunately this location is hard ever prepared for their lunch rush, they are right next to Luke Air Force Base and get a rush literally every day, and they never seem to be stocked in chow Marin or fried rice... something that 90% of order include.   I will not pretend to know what it takes to manage and perfect the timing on the preparation of these foods, but I know that something should be adjusted to avoid having to wait for chow mein, orange chicken, or teriyaki chicken every time I visit.   I'll be back, because it's a good deal price wise and I enjoy the meals, but they're frustrating when it comes to getting in and out."}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food often but every once in a while I really crave panda! Their prices are good for how much food you get. This location is always fast, friendly, and the food is always hot. My favorites are the bejing beef and the orange chicken. The chow mein and fried rice are good. They usually give you a coupon on the receipt for the next time where you can get an extra item free. I also noticed that they are now serving brown fried rice. It is nice to have a healthier option available. They followed with the new California regulations and have calories posted on all the items. Knew it was bad but now it is confirmed! Still so good sometimes!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst and most incompetent service. Avoid this place. It's like the girls there are brain dead.  Avoid it as you will get anxiety. Made me wait 15 min to place and order just to get it wrong- I called for a manager , I was then hung up on. Trying at no avail, phone rang 1200x with nobody picking up now!!! Absolutely the worst!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a - 0 if I could. I ordered a three item combo and after getting home I started eating and in my chow mein was two rubber bands. I swallowed one and pulled the second from my mouth. Was very sick for two days. After filing a claim with panda express they denied its there rubber band and refunded my meal. Some guy named Ron ( would not even give me his last name) from what panda called risk management said they don't use rubber band in any of the stores hmm then how the hell did a rubber band get in my food It just popped in there like Magic  or it opened the lid itself and jump in the container all by it self?or they basically saying that I put it in there myself. I'll never eat at any panda ever again."}
{"text":"Good food but then I was grossed out when I saw the lady clean the men's room. She cleaned it which is ideal but then she mopped it too and THEN she proceeded to mop the rest of the entire restaurant with the urine saturated mop from the restroom. Just gross. Don't forget your order of operations."}
{"text":"I've been going to Panda Express for almost 20 years, I'm normally a big fan. This was my first time going to this location and I was very disappointed! Even though there were only three people in front of me and three behind me, this Panda Express was completely out of Teriyaki chicken.  We were all told it would be a 15 minute wait for Teriyaki chicken! I said ALL because half the people in line wanted the Teriyaki chicken. I've worked in restaurants and in the fast food industry and you can fry up chicken in 12 minutes so why would Teriyaki chicken take that long at a \"fast\" casual restaurant?  I'm actually writing this as I wait, that's how long it took them to prepare the food. So now the rest of my food will be barely warm as I am given the freshly prepared Teriyaki. And did they offer a free drink or egg roll to the five of us that waited patiently? Nope!  It ended up taking 23 minutes! And when I got home the Teriyaki chicken was fatty and one piece had a bone in it. Upper management needs to come do something about this location!"}
{"text":"We always come to this one bc the food is fresh the staff is pretty friendly and it's always clean.  It's close to the soccer sports park and a great brunch to finish off the afternoon..."}
{"text":"I love coming to this location...Out of all the Pandas.... this IS one of the ones we go out of our way to come too....my kids LOVE LOVE Pandas.... They  have the best customer service and so very very helpful.... They are polite and best of all..its clean! I have OCD so cleanliness is key!  Thank you guys for all u do!"}
{"text":"Gross \"chicken\" and mushrooms...very oily and salty.  It tasted like a $1 michalinas frozen entree.  The chicken is so processed, it's like chicken nugget filling...had a fluffy, chewed-up texture.  The plain white rice was undercooked.  And again, OILY.  The chicken egg roll was old and had just been dropped into hot oil and re-fried again to warm it up.  It was three different shades of dark brown (old oil!) This place is disgusting...don't do it!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was what you expect at a Chinese carryout place. Got a coupon for doing a survey on the back of the receipt that I misread, which is totally fine. I called to make sure they take phone orders (which I was told they did because online ordering is not available in this location) and was corrected on what the coupon actually was, totally fine, told them I would call them back after looking at their menu online again. When I called back I was informed that they do not actually take phone orders because they did not want to upset customers who were waiting in line seeing others get served before them. How long has phone ahead been a thing at restaurants?!?! I had time to go through the drive through in which I waited 15 minutes to put in my  order  with only 3 cars between me and the payment window. When I got to the order speaker, I was told to wait while I heard the order taker screaming at his coworkers for 5 minutes. I ended up receiving the wrong order when I picked it up. Never again."}
{"text":"I'm usually disappointed in these fast food Chinese establishments but no this time! The food was excellent! I ordered a family size meal for about $32 for my students. This includes 3 takeout boxes of chow mein or fried rice (or both) and 3 entrees. We had the chow mein with Kung pao chicken, beef broccoli, and orange chicken. Yuummm!  Everything tasted fresh off the wok and the staff was super friendly. No complaints from me everything was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Meh...the food wasn't stocked real well it seemed like they were short a cook??? I felt like I ended up getting a lot of the left over food from the night before. You know that hard rice and dried chow mein. I ordered half and half (fried rice and chow mein), Shanghai Angus Steak ($1.25 extra) and Teriyaki Chicken...the meat dishes were great! But the rice and chow mein were subpar...so sad. I'm super Asian, so having good rice and chow mein is kinda essential to having a great meal. I wish I brought my secret stash of sriracha sauce because their sriracha packages smell grossly like vinegar...yuck! (That's at every Panda Express not just this location...it's the brand of sriracha they're using I tell ya!)  The person who took my order was super nice  I noticed that she was ready to help everyone...however, I ALSO noticed that the other person working there...(maybe a manger??? idk) only greeted male customers...hmm. Of course I'm kinda offended but I'm not gonna let that dictate my rating for the FOOD...(otherwise this place would be getting a 1 star review from me...the 1 star for the lady who helped me.)  Would I come back...maybe...if I ever crave cheap fast and greasy Chinese food."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that my complaints are isolated to this single store. They are not.  The food is cheaply done for a not so cheep price. One dish tends to taste like five others that they have. Like its the same sauce,  just with different meats and sometimes vegetables.  It feels like the place belongs in the food court of a mall. Not near a Goodwell. I suppose its location can tell you something about the quality of food one is going to get.  The employee always look over work and seem to not enjoy being there. It makes it feel like I have slave labor preparing my food. Which is a little disconcerting.   The bathrooms are not to bad, but at timea are filthy. At least the food and dining area look clean most if the time.  I can't recommend this place as I avoid eating here myself."}
{"text":"Bad food, extremely bad service, drive somewhere else. Save throwing food away.  Took 15 minutes to get someone to wait on us, than waited another 10 minutes for them to make tea ?"}
{"text":"I only ever get the orange chicken.  Besides the occasional crispy bit disguising itself as chicken, I have no complaints"}
{"text":"All the employees just seemed pissed off at having to serve my food. They were hostile and rude and when I asked for a sample of Beijing beef I was literally handed a fried bit of nothing. No beef a fried bit of grossness. Thank you for a terrible experience. Also out of iced tea and chow mein. Who runs this place? Also, I ordered a cream cheese Rangoon's and they gave me 1/6 of a side of sweet and sour sauce I posted a picture before I ate any. And to put the cherry on top they did not give me silverware, so I guess they wanted me to be able to eat this dog food with my hands"}
{"text":"Panda Express, I wish I could quit you! Especially after I stupidly keep coming back to this location. The staff here can't multi-task. When they try to, that's when people's food starts to get mixed up and down and around. Let's focus on one person at a time. That's great that you want to help 10 people at a time but again the staff can't handle that. Especially Jesus, good luck at successfully telling him you'd like a 3 item entree. *slow blinks* He's way too flustered.   You guys write what I want on my container so why do I constantly have to remind you for the third item like 5 times?   The last time I was here there was nobody else and I waited too long to get service. We were acknowledged by a staff member sweeping but....................I guess his brain wasn't sending signals to his feet that day to walk over immediately to take our order.  Eventually something clicked up there that paying customers were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting to get service. OMG"}
{"text":"Not real Asian food by any means but it will fill you up if you are on a budget.  On the plus side, the place is kept very clean and it's fast.  Be careful if you are diabetic, the chain uses a TON of sugar in everything. It's what they substitute because PE doesn't use MSG."}
{"text":"Paid $10 for honey walnut shrimp entree.  Opened the box and it was filled half way. I was notified that my option would cost $5 more for the entree, not that I would also receive half the amount."}
{"text":".1 Star - Drive thru service is consistently horrible, seems like their blindsided for dinner. Extremely slow service, cars literally do not move. This can't be a surprise to the leadership of this business, been coming here on and off for years and there is ZERO improvement at this facility. If you go inside it's no different...lot of money being left"}
{"text":"We bought two meals. The fried rice was bland, mushy and didn't taste like fried rice at all.  It was more than half the meal with barely anything else mixed in it. The other food was just as horrible, overcooked mush, with far too much flavorless sauce.  Both of our meals were equally as bad.  I would have to be starving before I'd eat there again.  What a pile of garbage!  I am surprised they are still in business."}
{"text":"Horrible, terrible, inexcusable customer service is provided here. My husband and I waited for someone to help us after our food had been collected. All we needed to do was pay and leave. Some girl that worked there just stared at us as we were standing by the register. Some girl continued to look up and down at her work. Then at us. Then at her work. She gave a bad look to a coworker, looked back at us, and continued to go back to her work. She did not say anything, not a \"sorry for the wait,\" \"I'll be right with you,\" or \"Let me help you.\" Would not recommend. We went elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is your typical Panda Express; the food is predictably good - the same predictable food you will get at any other Panda Express. Nothing to write home to mom about; but so much healthier than the typical fast-food joint."}
{"text":"Once again, Panda has given me poor, slow service and a streaming serving of meh. Why do I keep torturing myself?   Three ppl in line, including me. Mr. Whispersalot keeps asking me questions that I can't hear over the music, workers, banging pots, and someone's screaming child. His co worker leans in and yells at me what he was asking, with lots of gesticulation, like I'm an imbecile. It's not that I couldn't understand him - I just couldn't HEAR him. Finally, I get across that I want the broccoli beef to go. He spoons it into the bowl and then asks me if it is for here or to go. Now who doesn't understand? I say to go again, he slaps a lid on it, then tells me to go to the checkout.   The two people in front of me are browsers, \"do you have this or that, can I have a sample of that, how much are your egg rolls,\" etc. I bypass them and meet him at the checkout.  ...and he walks right past me into the back! I'm standing there like a doofus while the browsers continue their shopping for another 5 minutes or so. Meanwhile, little miss Can't Make Eye Contact completely ignores me.   I stand there. She answers their questions. She gives samples. She sells them drinks. Mikey Can't Decide goes over his egg roll options again. She checks them out. My guy never returns. Finally, without looking at me, she asks, \"Is that for here or to go?\"  Arrrgh!  The food isn't good enough for this aggravation. Heck, it's not good, period."}
{"text":"This was my first time to a Panda, so I do not have the menu memorized. I guess I should have studied ahead, because if you look around or try to read the board, you cease to exist.   When I walked in, I was the only customer. The lady behind the counter offered me a sample and I took it. As I put it in my mouth, I moved down the food case to see what they had.   Just as I got ready to place my order, a blonde woman walked in behind me. The employee asked if she wanted a sample. Blondie said no and proceeded to order FOR FIVE PEOPLE.   Now, common courtesy (or one hour of customer service training) would have dictated the clerk say something like, \"Excuse me, let me get this person's order first, as she was here before you.\" Instead, she looked right through me and proceeded to fill all five orders while I stood there looking like a dope.   Someone from the back came up to ask me if I had been helped. I told her I got a sample and then the other woman cut in front of me, so, no, I was still waiting for service. She said, \"OK.\" and returned to the back without offering to help me.   Miss Clorox was still building her order, so I went to the bathroom. When I came back, she was STILL ordering while the clerk filled to-go box after box full of food and stacked them into bags.   I stood there and watched the drive-through people scamper around for a bit, then decided I'd just leave. As I turned to go, the lady from the back came up again, rolled her eyes like, \"Oh, you're still here,\" and asked if mine was to go. I was so excited to be visible again that I went ahead and ordered.   I got the vegetables and the walnut shrimp. No, I didn't want rice. No, I didn't want egg rolls. No, I didn't want cookies. No, I didn't want those fried wonton thingies. No, I didn't want another entree.  I guess I didn't order enough, because she kept trying to sell me something. She finally talked me into getting some iced tea.  Sat down. Ate. Wish I'd left. It's basically pseudo Chinese-McDonalds. Not worth the effort. Oh yeah, and there were no towels in the bathroom. Fail."}
{"text":"Their service was really nice and.  friendly! but their chicken was over-Cooked and really dry.  Wasnt taste good :(   There was No way to dm u :(  Doesnt pop up"}
{"text":"Filthy, filthy, filthy  Early Sunday evening (Oct. 11, 2015)....moderate crowd.  Tables absolutely filthy.  Trash cans overflowing.  Spilled food on the floor under the tables.  This was embarrassing.  I was disgusted and walked out with my two daughters.  You can't be serious!  If this is how you maintain the \"front of the house\", what's the \"back of the house\" (kitchen, food prep area) look like??  You should be shut down!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I order the same thing every time I go and they gave me broccoli beef when I usually get Beijing beef then argued with me about how sure they were about my order. Just get the order correct next time."}
{"text":"Had to wait for table. Kind of expected due to lunch rush.1pm.  I noticed manager and another employee sitting at a table eating even with a line of 6 people waiting to order. I asked for sweet fire chicken received surf & turf."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, I am a fan of Panda Express in general just because I went to college in Santa Cruz, and sadly, this was the closest thing to good Chinese food.  This Panda Express like many others is consistent.    One thing that irritated me about this location was that when I got there, they only had a fourth of the menu items out.  Maybe they had just opened?  I was not keeping track of time because I was too busy gambling.    Nevertheless, they had the entrees and items that I wanted."}
{"text":"Generous portions and friendly employees.  Add fresh food, and you have a home run.  This Panda Express is located across from Mandalay Bay.  The location on The Strip is more convenient, but both the food and service are not as good."}
{"text":"First of all I waited a really long time for my food which I was fine since I was thinking the whole time \"yay fresh foo!\". Well that was not the case. The orange chicken tastes like rubber! The fried rice which was what I was waiting for had NO flavor whatsoever and some of it was still undercook! To top off the night we also waited for the teriyaki chicken which as well had NO flavor not even after adding teriyaki sauce. Very disappointed with this. I'm not upset about waiting I'm upset about the food!"}
{"text":"I notice the reviews for this location are up and down. I came in at 5:00. Noone else was there, which was weird to me, because I'm accustomed to standing in line in other locations. (Specifically Florissant, MO). The staff didn't appear overly excited, but it wasn't bad either. Just so so. Food was as I would expect for panda. But veggies were overcooked. I don't like that. Nothing out of ordinary that would keep me from coming back. So that some this location up. ORDINARY. Average."}
{"text":"The food and service quality in here is variable, on a good day the food is hot and the service fast, on a bad day the rice is cold and the wait is long... Standard pseudo Chinese fare, no surprises although the teriyaki chicken is consistently good; as is the Angus steak offering WHEN they have it. So blah - ok place to scratch an itch if you want 'sorta Chinese'."}
{"text":"I admittedly love the Panda. Mom and I go here on occasion together for lunch or dinner. We swung by this one today for a quick bite at lunch. It's tops in my book, as Panda Expresses go. Clean, friendly staff, they spoke English, didn't run out of anything, and had lots of table so we were sure to find a spot to sit.   New concept I saw, drive through at the fast food chines spot, kinda weird but hey we are all on the go, drive thru rocks!"}
{"text":"We like this place when we feel like takeout. It is unfortunate they can be a bit pricey and don't have very many seafood options. The ones they do have are an additional charge."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need food. Sometimes you only have enough time at an airport to get in the shortest line for the place that has something that is passed off as food. That is this place.   Does all Chinese fast food have to be fried so that it doesn't matter what type of meat you order? Apparently that is the case here. My brother had Orange Chicken and I had some type of shrimp and they basically looked the same. While I didn't try his, I would bet money they tasted the same too.  I tried to order mine with brown rice. Yes, I know, look at me trying to be healthy at the fried Chinese food place. You do what you can! But I couldn't. No brown rice. It's on the electronic menu. It's a simple thing to have at this type of restaurant. But no, I was told they don't have it at this location. Then why is it on the menu??   I did survive eating it even on a flight with turbulence. For that and because the staff was exceedingly nice generally and when telling me they didn't have brown rice, two big stars.  Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Awful experience. Under portion size, poor service, old food. Bypass and go to another one!"}
{"text":"I got a 1 entree bowl from here and the brown rice that I got with my order was either old or undercooked because it was super hard to chew. I came in and ask them to switch it out for just all chow mein instead. I hardly even ate any of it for me to realize the rice was hard. The guy offered to give me a little box of chow mein, which was annoying because I ordered it with orange chicken and the hard brown rice was stuck onto the sticky orange chicken. I had somewhere to be so I was in a rush & just accepted it. When I finally got to eat my food I was sitting there picking off the hard rice on the orange chicken. It was just an annoying experience and I felt like they should've been a little more accommodating when it was them either serving UNDERCOOKED or OLD BROWN RICE."}
{"text":"When it comes to the Panda call me...ummm...Panda? (no witty comment). I make it a goal to eat at Panda Express at every chance I can muster. I enjoy their clean fresh presentation style, and open kitchen, made to order(close to) entrees. If you are new to their food, or havnt been within the last 6 months, be sure to try their new sweet fire chicken. However(there is always a flip side) this resturante wont give you the experience that Mr. Panda is known to provide. This location is dirty, the noodles are never fresh (ate here twice), and the in-store dinning is not too appealing.   ON A SIDE NOTE WHEN EATING AT PANDA ALWAYS ORDER TO GO, YOU GET MORE THAN THE STANDARD IN HOUSE DINNING PLATE"}
{"text":"Panda Express is always our favorite! I've experienced great customer service from the manager. She's very helpful and productive! Our favorites entrees are orange chicken and homey shrimp"}
{"text":"For a quick meal in Vegas, this isn't a bad choice. The line always tends to be long at this location, and it is definitely overpriced. The also tend to run out of entrees often, so have a few in mind before coming, or expect to wait. However, that is all expected for being in a busy shopping mall on the strip. The workers are all pretty energetic and efficient. There's definitely better food to eat in this mall (such as Earl's sandwiches), but this may be one of the quickest choices."}
{"text":"If you need something other than a taco or hamburger for a quick meal, try Panda for sure....  1.  Chinese Food - Okay, it ain't really authentic, but close.  Too much generic vegetables like carrot and celery to fill up the dishes.  However, the food is not terrible at all.  Just kind of slopped together and kinda like putting ketchup on your scrambled egg or getting those fried chicken  meals from Albertsons or Smiths.   2. Parties, Guests, Office - If you have a staff of people, you can order party trays and this is a great deal. Somehow, even though the food is decent at best, somehow when you put them in aluminum trays and big servings, it tastes better..... People that are not native to the food will find it quite edible.  3.  Authenticity - I rarely see any Chinese people ordering from here. It is like going to Del Taco expecting real authentic Mexican food. You are getting the hybrid here.  You can order a side of Chow Mein and Side of Fried Rice in a party tray and it is like only 11.00 each. Now that is a great deal,   Try it...you won't mind."}
{"text":"Second time at this location. So nice that they have a drive thru and outdoor seating area! I got the orange chicken for the second time, asked if the recipe was different (chicken breading looked a lot different) - no response, was just given a sample. It was not good this time . I also think if I'm ordering to go from inside, they should put utensils in the bag for my rice.. didn't think to have to walk across the restaurant to grab a fork before leaving? Glad I checked my bag before leaving the area. Disappointed with this experience, hoping next time it will be as good as my first visit!"}
{"text":"I am a new fan, got one at home and never been. Everyone likes the orange chicken so give that a try. Quick easy and very tasty. Will start going regularly. This one is too busy and A/C sucks, take a cab a few blocks away in Paradise, across the street from Mandalay Bay, lot less busy."}
{"text":"Everybody knows that there's a Panda Express on almost every corner and inside several casinos. My mom flew in for a visit and was craving Chinese. I know this location is somewhat near Chinatown but to be honest I've only eaten Chinese in that area @ one place and it was my worst experience so I chose to just take her here.. cheap good Chinese.  2 ITEM ENTREE: We wanted to try the new Kobari beef but the bin was empty. So... I asked the only girl behind the counter how long would we wait before the next batch was made. She didnt seem to understand what I said and gave me and my mom a sample of 2 small pieces of beef left @ the edge of the barren pan. (not what I asked for but GREAT!.. it was goooooood!) I was excited.. so I asked my quetion again. Nope didn't understand. so I asked her in spanish (what little I could muster up) \"cuando va estar lista la carne?\"... nope... well hell couldn't figure out what her primary language was b/c it wasnt chinese. My mom finally said I think she's cuban or PR or something b/c we heard her speaking Spanish as we left. SO.. she didn't answer me on purpose. How does a place stay open if you cant order?   We hung bk for a few minutes discussing if we should just find another Panda Express or go next door to the Orleans and eat @ their Chinese place. We decided we'll just wait for the nxt batch and we pointed to whatever we wanted - Kobari beef and Beef & broccoli. sooo... good.  Id definitely eat that again.. just maybe not @ this location."}
{"text":"There's a Pei Wei nearby but go to Panda instead! You might expect the food to be not as good here since everything is pre made but the quality is consistent with the food in other locations and it's FAST. The workers are also pleasant despite the holiday crowds."}
{"text":"I used to like coming to this locations to eat  . But the quality of there food has gone down and what they serve. They don't always have the food out that you want and they are going skimpy on portion size .  The food is not fresh anymore.   I am so disappointed with this location. So what i say to the people who work at this place fixts this problem."}
{"text":"For those of you who know that I am vegan, also know that panda isn't particularly vegan. However there is a way to enjoy their delicious food that is vegan friendly.   I have the Chow Mein and the Spring Rolls I add some teriyaki to it and one packet of chili and VOILÀ! It's magic Chow Mein.   But this is more about the customer service there, more in particular a worker named PRIMA. She is very professional, attentive and keeps a smile on her face and exemplifies what an employee should be. I have been to this location on multiple occasions and Prima appears to work very well with her coworkers. She picks up the slack when the line gets slow, she encourages her coworkers with works well done and keeps the this facility clean and tidy.   I must say works as if Panda Express is her personal business and she makes sure it is taken care of whenever she is here (from my own observations). When I'm not eating here I come up to do some office work by utilizing their free wifi and while here Prima has shown to be very consistent and enthusiastic about her position at Panda and as a customer she is a delight to work with when I'm buying food.   I'd recommend this Panda location over any that I have visited up to this point.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Panda Express for the first time. It's meh. I ordered a plate of broccoli steak with two SIDES of fried rice and mixed vegetables. When I got home the broccoli steak which was the MAIN ENTRE was given to me as a side and the rice was in the MAIN ENTRE portion of the plate.  There was a whole lotta broccoli and only three tiny scraps of steak.  Check your dinner before you leave the parking lot."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping by after shooting hoops Sunday nights. The store is well ran. Clean store, fast service. No surprise that they have a line to the door at 9 pm on Sunday nights."}
{"text":"It's Panda Express.  Run of the mill chinese imitation food.   I like the bejing beef.  It's clean in here, the staff is quick, and its got a drive thru which is pretty cool.  Well, it's cool until the guy in front of you has apparently never been to a Panda Express and decided on the drive thru.  I somethimes think they are waiting for a magical hand to reach out of the speaker to give them a sample of what every deep fried delecacy they are thinking of.  It's not gonna happen. Go inside for the samples, firends."}
{"text":"It's too bad you can't give 1 Star. This is the worst panda in America hands down.! What a bunch of slow moving non helpful employees eating behind the line. Eating in the lobby. The employees eating when I was here outnumbered the customers eating 2 to 1. What a joke.!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up and when I got here at pick up time they hadn't even looked at my order. They had to make one of the foods and I wound up waiting 10+ minutes more for something I was told would be ready. Definitely will be going somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"They are all the same.  But I am impressed that this store is fast and efficient with serving.  There is not much seating in the place since it shares a seating area with Chipotle and a pizza joint, so I would recommend preparing to get your food to go.  3 stars because I asked for more orange chicken than fried rice and he told me \"No\". Really????"}
{"text":"Came in tonight at 7 and the beef and broccoli and the walnut shrimp were not fresh. I asked for a new order and they made me one and gave me a sofa on the house since we had to wait. Not even a huge deal, I was happy to wait. While waiting a lady came in and started freaking out on the staff. I felt horrible as one of the girls working even offered to pay for her meal out of her own money. The staff was beyond accommodating to us while we were waiting and to the lady who was freaking out. Service here has always been great and I love that the staff will make you a new order if what you want is not fresh. We frequent here often and this is exactly why. Fresh food as well as great staff."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I end up having to wait 10 minutes for fresh food. They have never had enough food to feed a family of 4 in their line of food. And they are not even bust. Seriously, I am not an avid Panda goer as my kids are the ones that love Panda. Especially when I am always leaving with my food cold because there wasn't enough food for my kids. This is the 4th time I have been to this location because it is closest to my house, but no more. I will not come here again."}
{"text":"Unsanitary and some of the associates don't have the basic knowledge of food safety. I still can't  believe the girl touch my food with her bare hand. Just FYI They are handling money and serving food at the sametime without hand washing in between.  Won't come back again."}
{"text":"I know everyone has bad reviews but the associate whose name was Rosalinda was very sweet I had to wait extra to get my food due to the lunch rush which can be irritating and she was kind enough to compensate some of my meal for waiting. She was very helpful and will be back."}
{"text":"Me 10 years ago: Panda Express, mmm good, and they give you lots!  Me today: Panda Express is crap. It's got to be the most average, bland, over-Americanized \"Asian\" food around.  I challenge you to find more average/below average food chain anywhere in the state."}
{"text":"Dining room is disgusting.  Dirty tables, dirty floors.  Many entrees missing or not fresh.  Manager on duty seems to care but young employees clearly don't give a crap about anything"}
{"text":"Panda Express unleashed Chinese fast food on the masses. It isn't hard to see why this place succeeds, though at the same time they do leave something to be desired.  The big draw of Panda Express is the obvious one - It's a fast, inexpensive way to get Chinese food. They have a variety of items, including chicken, pork, beef, soup, egg rolls, and a variety of drinks, both fountain and bottled. The Orange Chicken is, far and above, their most popular item, and is an excellent choice. The place also has a variety of promotional items on their menu on a regular basis.   One complaint I have about the establishment, however, is that very few of their restaurants actually have drive-thru windows. The ones I know of that do are Stephanie/American Pacific, Sunset/Sandhill, Warm Springs/Las Vegas Blvd., and Boulder City. There are tons of others, but these are the only ones I know of and have visited on a regular basis.  Sadly, the food at Panda is ready-made and waiting under heat lamps. This means no customized orders.   Much as I like the food here, I do have other complaints. First and foremost, service is second-rate. Ordering through the box, they often mishear my order. At the aforementioned Sunset/Sandhill location. I said I wanted \"fried rice\" with my Panda Bowl. The woman said back to me \"white rice?\" I said \"fried rice\" again to correct her. So why were the next words out of her mouth \"white rice\" again? There is no such things as \"white rice\"; it is called STEAMED rice. This is just one story of hundreds I could tell.   Additionally, I usually eat at the Stephanie/American Pacific location, but one time I showed up right at the time it said they opened, and NO ONE showed up to take my order. Your opening time is a contract to your customers, period. BE READY TO SERVE YOUR CUSTOMERS AT THAT TIME.  Despite the order mishaps and the lackluster selection of restaurants with a drive-thru window, the food here is quite good. There is bound to be a restaurant near you, so I can give it a firm recommendation. Just be sure you visit a stand-alone location, as grocery store/mall locations often don't have the complete menu."}
{"text":"AVOID!!! This has been the worst experience ever! Staff here is super rude. Guy named MIKE didnt even ask me if i wanted any TERIYAKI in my TERIYAKI chicken and he literally told me i HAVE TO ASK. What the heck is that. Its TERIYAKI CHICKEN!! He was so rude about it And was talking back really rude when i told him he didnt even ask!! Then lady at the register ALANA told me she cant give me his name because thats personal information. Ummm hello, you guys wear NAME TAGS!!! Once i pointed that out she gave it to me and told me he was new, you cant treat people like crap! They forgot about extra things I ordered too. Everyone is so rude here ! Never been treated so bad anywhere!!! I hope no one gets treated the way i was treated here today."}
{"text":"Have been to this location twice & wont be back! The first time it was around 2 PM and could clearly see that the food at sat. With regret- I had gotten the Orange Chicken & Beijing Beef. The Orange Chicken didn't have enough sauce coated on the pieces. Wasn't tossed properly & probably sat in the heat lamps over time as they were dry, tough and uneatable.  A few days ago we were in the area and actually wanted to go to ANOTHER place that wasn't open ( they had a note on the door saying they were on vacation). So, we ended up here! Our orders were two bowls with chow mein noodles only and one side. I got the pecan shrimp, our server only fill my bowl 1/2 way & gave me 6 pieces of shrimp. My daughter had the Beijing Beef which was ok however they gave her the child's portion in a bowl at full price! We opted to not do the Orange Chicken as you could clearly tell that had been sitting. Just as the server completed our meal the cooks dumped a fresh batch of that into the Buffett Bowl. GUURRRGGG!!  We also ordered two egg rolls which the server left on the counter & I had to ask her for. Plus reiterate that we needed dipping sauce! She didn't give us a fortune cookie until we requested that and condiments. The funniest thing was the \"other\" server loaded up the next customer behind us with such big portion I'm sure he couldn't finish!! LOL These Panda Expresses can be a hit or miss with fresh product. You have to dine at their peak hours to ensure good quality food. Otherwise, it a heat lamp exposed over cooked mess!"}
{"text":"Came in Saturday around 1:00 PM. Not to busy, but a good sign was the employees were rotating the buffet bowls out with fresh food. That was encouraging as some items looked like they needed to be swapped out.  We decided to get the single serving bowl ( to go): 1 item with Chow Mein & Orange Chicken. This beloved popular dish, was a perfect treat after a hard gym workout. LOL  Less than $6 for the bowl and plenty for a smaller appetite.   This location during the time we were in was \"on top of their game\" and we appreciated that. Will come again."}
{"text":"So, our family of four came in this location last night at about 9:15 PM. We noticed a few patrons still eating in the front dinning room, as we had to make our way through them to place our order on the \"other side\" of the restaurant! As we approached the counter there was one customer ahead of us. The staff had made no accessibility to the \"start of the line\", because they had taken the large high top bar stools and placed them across the front of the line. We assumed they closed at 10 ; but by the looks of it they were wanting to close up shop a little earlier, I guess! Anyway, the first gal that assisted us asked -if we would like to \"sample a taste\" of the new sesame chicken : it was good & she was pleasant. She started our order, served on a plate our first portion & then onto an employee that \"lacked in any type of customer service\". This young girl (with glasses) wasn't thrilled to be serving us and we just got the feeling she was irritated by our requests & just wanted to go home! Never once smiled and seemed bothered by it all! By the time we got to the cashier (Joseph) it was a much better experience, he was professional & friendly,. Closed the sale well.  BTW-I had ordered ( in place of the noodles or rice) a side of veggies. They were delicious: highly recommend.  As we took our seats we noticed they never offered us any soy, chili sauce and we had no fortune cookie?  In rushing through our meal ( as the staff was cleaning around us) we notice directly across from where we're sitting an \"employees table\" that had some type of pie, all kind of drinks from the QT & a workout bottle full of tea. They were so busy cleaning around us/ that they didn't even clean up their own table! Customer service was not good, food was okay & stemmed fresh veggies is what gave it the three stars!"}
{"text":"Right at lunch time. Clearly not busy! Advertising the New \"Limited Edition\" Honey Sesame Chicken. It had  obviously been out awhile! Only about 8 Oz left. Asked if I wanted a sample: tried it to confirm, it had been sitting - DRY!! Got the Orange Chicken with Veggies. Full bowl of Vegetables & about 8/9 pieces of chicken. $6.31. Had to asked for condiments & a fortune cookie.  This spot is hidden to for a reason! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Most of my options were burnt and the portion sizes were extremely small. Panda express is pretty decent when you find a good one with decent size portions."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. The staff is very friendly and the food is always fresh. Nothing beats Panda Express. It's good food fast!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS  The food was cold and overcooked. I'll never be back. A waste of 7 hard earned dollars.  Should have asked for my money back.   Stay away"}
{"text":"No one expects the best \"Chinese\" food. But I've always had a good experience here. It seems to always be busy. And the staff is almost always friendly! I mean we all have our off days. I visit here at least once a week. I would recommend this place to visit, and have."}
{"text":"not different that anyother panda express you will visit. food is oily but tasty. As its located rite on the strip so its good for quick lunch when needed and if you want to spend 30$ for buffet :). enjoy the orange chicken...happy panda"}
{"text":":) return customer! i have been in UC area for 2 yrs and i think this is one of the best panda express. the servers that i encountered were all nice and friendly! I don't remember their names but i remember the lasted one: Syena~~and don't forget to flask the survey to win a free entree :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at several Panda Express locations in both Nevada and California. This Panda Express has a very limited selection and the food is luke warm at best. They never had tofu or eggplant and the restaurant was cluttered and disorganized. The service was mediocre. High prices too."}
{"text":"Monday october 10th you probably had the best staff working that i have ever encountered at a panda in my 25 years of eating there. Juan was incredible helpful fast and understanding.  The cook who was making the food was so incredible he litterally made like 4 dishes in minutes. That guy was a beast!"}
{"text":"Mushroom chicken and steamed white rice all day long. :) Do not like their fried rice, there's better to be had elsewhere. Of course their Orange Chicken is their signature dish so you can't go wrong with it. Their veggie spring rolls are top notch. Passion tea, yes please!   Much prefer their locations with drive thru but ay Panda is a good option."}
{"text":"I always want to like Panda Express. They're friendly, nice establishment, conveniently located- but the food always leaves me disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing team as always. I've worked with these guys before. They are probably one of the most hard working individuals and satisfying co-workers I have worked with. To say, something less than \"okay\" is an embarrassment to their character and working ethics. I am proud to return and see that the food is as amazing and tasty as I remembered. Attitude and customer care is at its best. They cover the expectations of how a \"fast/express\" restaurant should always run. As much as I miss this team of mine. It is difficult to read the comments by people who doesn't understand the portion and quality this specific Panda store is capable of. Guys keep doing what you are doing! You are doing nothing wrong at all! Best luck and know that this \"guy\" has your back. Cook good, live life, continue that satisfying service you have and I have seen and witness since I started and last worked there!"}
{"text":"panda express is panda express  but the manager is doing an employee evaluation / one on one with an employee in front of the eating customers   it is appalling   it is an iq indicator = l-o-w iq"}
{"text":"Terrible service, everything was out and had to wait causing lines to not move and be put the door, out of soy sauce and the chicken was freezer Burt. Obviously management is not monitoring this operation after looking at the other reviews. Worse Panda I've ever eaten at. Oh, at the end of me writing this review my daughter points our all the garbages are overflowing and she can't fit our trash in.  P.S- This is my first Yelp review. I think I'll start participating more and give the good restaurants the good reviews they deserve."}
{"text":"AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Love this place so much! Always friendly service, and great food! Always fresh! Cameron is one of the kindest employees I've ever met! Friendly, and great at his job! Will definitely be returning often!"}
{"text":"Literally worst customer service ever.   My husband and I went through the drive thru. The woman asks if we want to try one of the chickens. We say no and say one moment to decide what to order. Once we have decided my husband starts speaking. Places the order & greeted with silence. He asks if she got all that. Still nothing. Then we reverse the car less than an inch and the woman says 'welcome to Panda Express, how may I take your order?'.  I am confused as to why she could not hear us when making the order the first time around but whatever. Midway through ordering she tells us to hold on then comes back and asks what we ordered again. Pulled up to the window to pay & get our food. The lady hands us our food and then walks away from the window. Does not say have a good night or even say good bye.   The food was fine. Seemed fresh and portion size was good. Obviously it's fast food chinese so not the best thing I've ever eaten in my life or anything.   But due to the terrible customer service I will not return to this location ever. Seriously if you don't like your job then quit. Is it really that bad to just be nice to customers? Obviously management doesn't care because looking at the other reviews this has been an ongoing problem that has not changed."}
{"text":"I am not the kind of person that writes reviews but this has been enough and well deserved it. I've been to many Panda Express and this store is the worst one!!!! They never have their food ready. I move around the area, 4 months ago and I've been to this store maybe 4 or 5 times every time giving them the benefit of the doubt. Every time they tell oh we don't have that item. I tell them ok then give me this and they tell oh it will be a 6-10 min wait. One time I came in maybe 1 hr after opening because I wanted fresh food. They had nothing!!! Every plate was a wait and their excuse, oh we had a cater order. I've worked on the food industry and this is not acceptable. They never have their food ready, I'm not sure what they are doing there since that's their job. Horrible customer service. I am really mad right now and never coming to this store again."}
{"text":"We were excited when this Panda opened up just down the street from our home, but we were shortly disappointed. Every time that we have been here since it opened, either through the drive-thru or inside, the wait time is absurd! They are understaffed or not adequately staffed, very long wait times for everyone! We'd much rather go to the other Surprise location on Bell Rd if this location keeps up the way it is! We'd probably make it there and back home faster than it would take to come to this \"down the street\" location anyway!"}
{"text":"Food is always great and service is great it's quick quality Chinese food and the place is clean and staff is friendly"}
{"text":"I mean, it's food. Unauthentic, slightly overpriced for what you're getting, Chinese food. It's not the worst, but you definitely won't feel on top of the world after eating here. I had a chicken and chow mein bowl for lunch and half an hour after finishing it, I was so drowsy, it felt like I took NyQuil. On the other hand though, i wouldn't say no to it if it was offered to me for free, and I was full for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Don't fall for it!  I came from LA and wanted some good ol Panda Express after work one day.  I was severely disappointed.  The best part of PE is the fact that they give you so much that you have no option but to make 2 meals out of it.  Here, they really don't do that.  The portions are very little - it made for one solid meal... that kind of sucks.  Secondly, I didn't really get to choose from the variety of entrees that they have.  When I came in, the dude was scraping the last of the chow mein, and looking at the options, it was either the sauce and a few random veggies for the supposed broccoli & beef, or like 2 pieces of chicken mushroom. It was super sad and I literally just went for the 2 entrees where it looked like he could scoop enough out.  They were mad shiesty.  I'll definitely never go here again and I'll just have to wait for LA.   If you guys want repeat business or even good feedback, 2 things to improve: (1) larger servings; and (2) have all the entrees available! Now I'm just pissed thinking I don't get to eat cold chinese food for breakfast. And even if I did, I'd probably not be happy because the entrees weren't even really my selection, just what was left. Yeah, I said it again. :/  dmo out."}
{"text":"One of the better Pandas I've been to. Their food always looks fresh and most of the time they have the mixed vegetables made and they look fresh as well. Clean, and bathrooms are always taken care of. I've always heard you can tell the quality of a restaurant by their bathrooms and it definitely seems to be true."}
{"text":"I frequent this location as it's close by to where I work. Plus I need something cheap and fast.  I can usually get my food and leave pretty quickly, unless there's someone in line undecided what to get or if there happens to be a long line.  It can be busy at times. Usually it depends if there is something huge happening across the street at Orlenas Arena.  Also I find it strange, at busy times (like dinner) that stuff isn't prepard and ready to go.  The orange chicken can be bad or good depending who makes it. And I'm talking about freshly made if can be bad (over wok'd)  For the most part I get good service.  This location does have a tendency to have people begging or prostitutes walking about.  I actually prefer the Burbank, Ca location."}
{"text":"Don't go any time past 8:30.  Second time here and they are out of the main foods.  And the dude cooking looks like he is asked to give up his first born when asked to make more.....go to 59th and Beardsley or Norterra location if you want Express service."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the worst Panda Express around. I've been to this location 5-6 times and they stay consistent; consistent at cold food and bad attitude employees. I went in today and stood at the spot to place an order, no other customers, and the employee stood at the register and stared at me for 3 minutes...literally. The cook even came over and made his own plate while I stood there and waited.  Move on to a different location or a different restaurant. Sucks..I love Panda!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband got food poisoning last night. It was either from the orange chicken or honey almond shrimp. Mind you I'm going into my 9 month of pregnancy. I've never been so scared. It was awful!"}
{"text":"10 bucks fr 3 crab puffs and 7.50 for 1 eggroll. Don't use drive though. Got home and incomplete order."}
{"text":"Food at this panda express was pretty disgusting. Low quality meats and very inconsistent quality. Additionaly they are one of the only fast food places that dont give cuos of water and force you to spent almost 3 bucks for a bottle of water."}
{"text":"I visited this Panda Express location recently and I must say it was such a disappointment. I was at the counter ordering and they were out of noodles and I had to wait for a fresh batch. Chow mein? Isn't that a staple? Ridiculous. The food was not fresh. Since the noodles were unavailable, I had the chicken fried rice. The eggs in the rice tasted like they had gone bad. The majority of the entree items were not available. I selected the sweet and sour chicken and I received 80 per cent pineapple. I did not know it was sweet and sour pineapple. The last straw was when I saw the employee at the counter using toothpicks and grabbing food and eating it in front of the customers. Such a bad look. I don't know how many times she's used the same toothpick, put it in her mouth and used it again. No wonder there was no food left. The employees are eating it all. I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some panda while passing through.   Pretty typical panda.   The service was good.   The food was good.    Place was clean.   No complaints"}
{"text":"This is a great go-to place for a quick meal.  Located in the Chandler Fashion Mall.  Food is always good and the service is usually very fast, depending on crowds in the food court.  Server was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"It was okay place to grab a fast dinner with almost no wait time. We had a bigger plate it came with fried rice lots of it, Kung Pao chicken very spicy beware String bean chicken breast was yummy and mushroom chicken was good too. The lady was nice offered me a few free samples. Cheap and fast."}
{"text":"Ate here about a month ago and became very ill with a stomach bug...my wife ate at this same location a few weeks later and also got sick. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Why does this Panda Express take so long? The food is already made. The employees just mosey around like people haven't been waiting for 15 minutes just to order. Twice I have spent my entire lunch break just to get my food to go."}
{"text":"I have been here before after work and employees were a little rude, I just brushed it off. Today, 6 months later, I stop in before work and ordered 2 party trays for work. I said that if it would be difficult I would just order a few single bowls to go. The employee Litzi was really annoyed that I wanted to order food, I got the roll of the eyes and she tried to pass me off to someone else. I just spent $125 in order to surprise my Co workers with lunch today, and I will not let the rude attitude of this staff ruin today. The staff at 16th & Bethany Home Panda are still the BEST. I will only go there from now on."}
{"text":"During lunch rush this place is very busy which is a good sign. The food is fresh because they have to refill the trays with new fresh food. For fast food, it's above average service and quality."}
{"text":"Today's visit was no good .  I stop by here often and everything's always well made.  Today the chow mein was completely bland.  Had none of the usual seasonings .  Walnut shrimp was soggy and Beijing beef was pretty bland also .  Egg roll was somehow overlooked on outside and undercooked inside ."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location and my second and last disappointment .  I ordered three item plate with orange chicken, steak and shrimp, and walnut shrimp, chow mein and crab Rangoon's.  I don't how how they managed but eeeeeverything was bland.    Orange chicken was dry, virtually no orangey sauce, steak and shrimp was mostly tasteless potatoes and soggy snap peas, walnut shrimp was semi decent.  The served portion of noodles was less at both visits compared to any other location I've ever been.   My meal was $17 and such a waste of money."}
{"text":"Peppered shrimp is awesome with brown rice and fresh asparagus!  This is my go to place for a lunch on the go.  The staff is friendly and always willing to let you sample the dishes and pick a new favorite.  Cleanest Panda I've been to and cool/chic decor."}
{"text":"What I thought was going to be quick, took longer than expected. It was dinner time on a Thursday and I was pretty shocked at how busy they were. The girl working the front was in training so it was expected to take a little longer, so the wait was ok. There was a lady who was doing the serving for us indoor orders and man was she fast, like a machine. I don't usually do panda for Chinese, maybe once every 6 months but in the area I live in there aren't many spots to choose from. Its a clean spot with friendly employees. I did notice they had a fridge with freshly cut veggies that they use in their dishes and seen them grilling the teriyaki chicken. Being that it's busy you know your food is going to be fresh because nothing sits for too long."}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express ever! Possibly the worst meal we've ever spent money on. My hubby made the mistake of not checking the boxes of food before he left the restaurant. He came home with dinner. His teriyaki chicken was black, too burnt to eat. My beef and broccoli had one piece of beef and the fried rice was just rice and a little hard. Absolutely disgusting. Avoid this Panda Express by far the worst experience I've had with them."}
{"text":"Started frequenting Panda Express' FIRST concession in Scottsdale, Arizona at Scottsdale Fashion Square even though I had to travel, like, 8-9 miles to get there but was willing to every Sunday to get the ORANGE CHICKEN!  Now, there are so many locations and I don't have to drive nearly as far.  In fact, a new drive-through Panda Express opened about 2 miles from my house, although I haven't gone there yet."}
{"text":"Employee Micheal showed some excellent customer service skills. Stands out amongst other employees at this location."}
{"text":"This Panda Express gets a -3 stars from me due to the fact that when I ordered my families  food, the little girl at the window said my order back to me, but yet after I got my food, and got all the way back home.. I was missing a plate of food. Mine in particular. So I drive all the way back to panda, tell them I'm missing a plate of food and the girl looks me dead in my face and said \"you didn't get it cuz I didn't charge you for it\". Excuse me? WHO'S FAULT IS THAT?!? I placed an order, was repeated back my order and was charged. I should've had two plates and a kid's meal. I only got 1 plate and 1 kids meal because\"I wasn't charged for it\". So I tell the manager what happen and she looks at me and was like \"I understand you're upset. I can give you a discount on your meal.\" This discount was a discount of $0.78. W.T.F?!  I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS PANDA EXPRESS BECAUSE CLEARLY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THIS PLACE IS A F**ING JOKE."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst meal I have ever had . I went in as they were closing they were out of steak they said they would make it for me . Great !! I said big mistake . Smallest portion so much sauce tasted terrible . Panda get at me 602-570-4578"}
{"text":"You'd think this was the ONLY place to eat in the mall food court by the constant LONG line....all of the time.  The line moves along pretty quick as more hungry folks join into the growing queue. Panda has updated their menu board making it easy to order (not really too hard to order, just point to what you want and they spoon it onto your paper plate)....move along and pay.  It's Asian fast food...select two sides with fried rice or noodles (or get half & half)...it's not authentic, but it's pretty good and the same at any Panda Express location.  If you want just a quick and inexpensive bite--order a small fried rice...it's $2.46 with tax, just enough carbs to energize your Mall visit."}
{"text":"Blah! This Panda Express has a gross restroom (or disgusting customers who urinate all around the toilet in the ladies restroom and don't bother to flush either}. Either way, you can judge a restaurant's cleanliness by their restroom too.  I also observed the employee using the same cleaning towel to wipe the chairs to wipe down the table with. Double gross!  I am feeling nauseous from eating there. I went to check their rating inspection on Maricopa(dot)gov site, they usually get A's and B's. I still wouldn't eat at this location again."}
{"text":"I was just at this location. I was totally ignored despite the fact there were the front workers in the lobby. One steam cleaning and the other two talking very loudly in Spanish. I waited a while at the counter while they talked at the table in the lobby, finally one came up and just stood there and said, \"what can I get you?\" while still talking with the other girl over me ordering my food. Very rudely served me... I got half scoops of everything (no meat in meat entrees!). She didn't talk to me at all and I felt very uncomfortable although I wanted to complain about the food she dropped into the Beijing beef tray because she wasn't watching what she was doing and scooped it into my tray anyway... I didn't because she was so aggressive and I wasn't in the mood to argue over my lunch.  When I only drove down the street to my office, the food was all rubbery because it had been sitting in that hot table sooo long and I got no meat in my beef and broccoli and two pieces in my kung pao. Just to top it off I was halfway back to work and realized I didn't get a drink so stopped to get one somewhere else (they normally ask) no big deal but still annoying. I will NEVER go back. Terrible service and horrible servers."}
{"text":"Could be good if they cared.  I really want to like this place but they just don't care. Every time I have been in they are out of at least 3-4 entrees. Today, more than half of their entrees were missing and they  only had fried rice left for a side (except for a few chow mein noodles). They weren't even close to busy either.  I should have walked out then and never came back but I ordered an entree I didn't want and a side I didn't want because I was hungry and needed to get back to work.   They gave me a lot of the side I didn't want but only a few pieces of meat for my entree like they were afraid they would run out of that too.  They have replied on Yelp saying they will look into this problem but obviously nothing has changed.  Plenty of better options around but I just need to remember to call ahead instead of waiting until the last minute."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've basically been refused service. I usually have no issues, but if it hits 9pm (an hour before close), they refuse to make eggplant tofu. I have issues digesting meat, so I can't have any of their other dishes, and even telling them that, they refuse to make even a personal portion. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"I was out of school by 9:30 a.m and with a serious craving for orange chicken. My local Chinese place did not open until 11 and I was starving. I drove past Panda Express on my way home and remembered they open at 10:00am. I had stopped coming to panda because the food always seems to sit out too long and it is always dry. Maybe it's because I was one of the first customers but food was crispy and fresh. Their orange chicken and chow mein are one of the best( besides homemade). Although prices are higher than the mom and pop owned Chinese food joints, it works great for emergencies like today."}
{"text":"Okay, I have to write this review. Because this would be the 3-4th time that I come here about 40 minutes before closing. The staff is totally unprofessional. It's always the same story; I order something... and they are out. Their excuse is that because they are getting ready to close. And they won't even try to make it. I would understand if it was 15-10 minutes before closing. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Panda is the GOAT bruh. Orange chicken is always popping and their beijing beef is % Grade A authentic Chinese food. I never been to China but I watch a lot of Kung Fu films so I have a pretty high  standard for Chinese food. Panda express kicks ass in every way"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, they literally go out of their way to provide you with excellent customer service, and they don't even accept tips ;)  Good food,  but then again you can't go wrong with Panda's Orange Chicken and Beef & Broccoli.  Honestly I don't understand why people are bashing this place, but then again I only visited this one time.. Definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Panda Express is a decent staple, the food isn't bad but the service is horrible at this specific location. I've never had to wait 30 minutes for fast food until I came here. The first few times I figured it was because of the dinner rush, but I've been there during the day and it's just as slow. Avoid this location if you can, unless you have an extra 30 minutes to burn."}
{"text":"I avoid Panda Express. In the past, I've had vegetables that are mush and have felt sick to my stomach. However, with our kitchen being worked on, this was one of the few options for a healthier lunch. I had not eaten from the Buckeye location before.  The good: I had the vegetables instead of noodles/rice, and they were actually very fresh and crisp. I was pleased. Nor did I feel sick afterward.  The meh: I had chicken and mushrooms, and the Shanghai Angus steak. They were okay. The flavors are so strong they make the meat and vegetables all taste the same. It was all quite edible, but I can cook better at home and for a whole lot cheaper.  An acceptable place out of desperation, but hey, I've had worse."}
{"text":"This panda is what you would expect from panda in quality. The big complaint I have here is understaffing. Frequently there is only one employee working the line and customers have upwards of 15 mins in wait. I understand lunch rushes and that pandas have lines. This one is just extraordinary in painful slowness. Employees are not apathetic to the speed and have come to expect this as the norm.  I'm writing this in line.... Only about 5 customers have been served in this time."}
{"text":"This place was pretty quick and fast. It's my first time at this location. Generally, I love Panda Express and I'm new to this area. I usually go to the Casa grande or Tempe location. So on this particular day, I was craving a orange chicken bowl, and drove 15 min out of the way to get it.   Typically, I would imagine that you would get roughly the same experience at a chain restaurant. This one however, wasn't one of my best experiences. The service was good, quick and fast. However, something seemed wrong with my orange chicken. My guess was it wasn't cooked all the way. It was floury and had a doughy texture. I didn't like it, and being on lunch and driving so far to get to this place, I had no time to talk to someone about it. I was just disappointed."}
{"text":"Never been a huge fan of this format for Chinese food, but when you're dying of hunger and have limited options, it does hit the spot. Went here because it was walking distance of the Comfort Suites on Roosevelt Street. Seems like most businesses that serve food near the hotel close fairly early, but Panda Express was open until 10:00 p.m.  I did the three entree platter which comes with choice of steamed rice, fried rice, or chow mein. They don't have the old standard General Tso's Chicken (or maybe old General Tso has since retired from the chicken business), but they did have a reasonable facsimile--the Sweetfire Chicken. I also asked for the String Bean Chicken, which had an aromatic component that was delicious, but that I couldn't quite place... cilantro? And finally, for my third entree I chose the Honey Walnut Shrimp. Panda Express's interpretation of these shrimp differs from the traditional Chinese restaurant (no mayonnaise sauce and hardly any candied walnuts), but the honey and the shrimp flavor comes through, so I guess they get a pass.  This restaurant was an oasis in a desert of food choices and saved us from almost certain hunger-induced lunacy."}
{"text":"I went there right before they closed and the staff was still very friendly even though I'm sure they wanted to hurry up and close. Sabrina was very nice and had great customer service."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky with my Chinese food. For a fast food restaurant, I love panda express. I used to go to the location every time I went to Cedar Point and I was so excited when this one opened. Clean nice environment to eat in and they have a drive thru also. Can't go wrong with their famous orange chicken. Panda express is a good fix for fast food chinese"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for cedar point to open, was craving Panda Express so I came to this location. Bad service, none of the employees seemed to know how to scoop food. All seemed like they haven't had proper training. Also noticed many food service standard violations such as no gloves being used when employees handled food in back. Food was not bad, service was horrible it took forever to get food. Inexperienced staff, wouldn't survive an hour rush at the cedar point location."}
{"text":"Classic American Chinese chain, what more to be said. This location will satisfy your craving for American mall food court Chinese food and I definitely appreciate how management works to keep food fresh and rotated.  Also kudos for cleanliness."}
{"text":"My young children love Panda Express orange chicken. They eat it 2-4 times a month. We were at the mall on a Saturday afternoon and stopped into the food court to have lunch. The kids ordered the orange chicken and happily started to eat. To our surprise, it was spicy. I noticed the color was a bit dark compared to normal but then I realized they must have mistakenly made it wrong. They were adamant it was made correctly and wouldnt provide a refund. It was completely inedible for my kids we had to throw it away and get them some pizza.   We're still deciding whether we'll be returning to any Panda Express but certainly never again to this one."}
{"text":"An hour before they closed, I decided to go to Panda to pick up a plate to cure a hangover.  I live super close to Costco by Galleria and this Panda location is literally next door.  Score!  The strip mall this sits in is huge!  Best Buy, Joann's, Costco, Starbucks,  Bed Bath and Beyond are just a few stores that fills this mall.  The location has floor to ceiling windows which brings a lot of light into the restaurant during the day and allows onlookers to view the restaurant from the outside at night.  The location is clean.  In fact the employees were mopping and wiping tables when I arrived.   I got the three entree plate for $8.08.  I was a little irritated that most of the food was gone by that time and they weren't looking to make anymore.  In fact, my favorite dish, the teriyaki chicken (I usually get it without sauce) was out of stock.  Buzz Kill!  Good thing my second dish was still there, the chicken and mushrooms.  I decided to get two orders of those and a 3rd order of the beef and broccoli.  My starch was the fried rice.  Chinese style rice with veggies and egg in it.  Super flavorful with the soy sauce, but I could tell it was made a while before I arrive.  Some rice grains were hard but still satisfied my palate.  The chicken and mushrooms are always a crowd pleaser!  Cut chicken thighs, button mushrooms and sliced zucchini. The sauce probably has a lot of ingredients.  I think  I taste oyster sauce and soy sauce.  Either way, it's delicious!  Packed with flavor and eat component offers delightful textures which makes the overall dish sing!  This is a place where you can get in, order and get out.  It's kind of like fast food but not really.  Plate lunch Chinese food is how I identify this place.  Panda is a place that I've always visited growing up and will continue to visit for years to come.  For those few people who have never tried it, get down and grab a plate."}
{"text":"While I've gone to anther location and had a Great enough time to obviously try it out again.   BONG BANG POW.... I was not too happy with the trip. I arrived around 2:30ish. Most/Half of the food looked hours old. Only 2 \"spring rolls\", 1 shrimp, 3 wonton's (I wanted to take a picture of it but I was with company and didn't want to look \"wierd\").   My first trip I ENJOYED the pepper chicken, so I tried it again. (had to wait 6 MORE min. because as I stated before..... they didn't have any done already),   Fire Cracker Chicken... very hot and fresh.. why??? BECAUSE I had to wait an additional 3 mins.  I wanted to order the Potstickers.... WELP.... S.O.L.... \"oh.. we musta sold out of them already, we don't have anymore\"    Wait... What?? @ 2:30ish.. who is the manager?  He/She is slackin on the job.. you open at 11am.. how can you be sold out of an side item 3 hrs into the day?   I probably won't come to this location again. But, I will try the place out again.  NOTE: My guest and I notice how much food was put on other patrons plate compaired to ours. To the point the server was saying \"Sorry\" b/c of all the food that was falling off the plate. I guess it matters who makes your plate.  Shucks.."}
{"text":"Our flight got in a lot earlier than expected, and we were starving.. We happened across this place to grab a quick snack before meeting people for lunch... It was surprisingly delicious!   The manager, Oliver, was friendly and accommodating (I tried a lot of samples of the spicy food first to make sure it wasn't too hot since I'm a wimp).  I'm giving this five stars because for a chain, cafeteria style restaurant, the food is quite tasty, fresh and fast. I got the Beijing beef and Pacific shrimp! And only $8.40 for two entrees and a side (I got the noodles). Def recommend. I can see myself craving this after drinking all night."}
{"text":"Where else do you turn to for super Americanized Chinese food!? It's really what you expect for this restaurant. There is a certain taste, a tang, for every single dish that is served here. The food is consistent, but just okay. Not good, not great! Plus, the chow mien is super greasy every time! But all dishes just fill you up really. It's fast food--it made me not want to eat for a day!!   If you're trying to eat healthfully, don't stoop to Panda Express! Go next door to subway, because PE is just too greasy to be healthy :P   This location is not that busy. There are no super long lines, and the place is clean because not a huge number of people visit! Also, the staff is welcoming and friendly. Sometimes they get sidetracked, but it's not too long of a wait time.   Have fun eating at Panda! If you're down for a cheap, filling meal, then this is it!"}
{"text":"You would think that after consistent dinner rushes on Fridays an establishment would plan accordingly with staff coverage.  Apparently not.  The last 3 (yes three!) times my husband and I have been here we have had to wait for a number of items to be made for our order.  I can appreciate that it's fresh, but during dinner time shouldn't this stuff be done ahead of time?  This last trip may have been the breaking point.  Only 2 people behind the counter putting orders together, and they clearly didn't work well together.  One couldn't remember whose order was what (remember we had to wait for food) and couldn't recall if people had paid and needed to see a receipt from every other person.  All in all, the food isn't worth the annoyance of the service, location, parking issues, etc...  Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"As always the food was great. Clean and well stocked at soda machine. Service was just okay. A new kid was giving little scoops. He had several people getting mad at him (not me). The place was very crowded and he was cracking under pressure. I feel like next time he will have it together and be awesome. I did get allot of onions in my plate. I would go back and give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want Westernized Chinese food that's a little greasy and good.  We went to see a show and didn't want to figure out where to eat so decided to get food at Panda Express and bring back to eat on the dining room in the hotel room.  It was 9PM and there was a short line and seating in the food court.  The woman behind the counter was giving samples of the steak and it was tasty.    I got the 2 item entree with a side for $8.15.  The side was either a noodle or fried rice and I picked the rice.  For my first item I picked the honey walnut shrimp and was told it was a premium item and would be an extra $1.25 which is fine as it is seafood.  The other item was honey sesame chicken.  They also charged extra for the angus steak that my husband ordered.  The batter on the shrimp was a little thick but tasty.  The green beans in the chicken dish was dried and not good but chicken was good.  Lots of food to fill me up.  Not a place I would frequent if I was a local, but ok once in a while.  The price reasonable too compared to prices I have seen for Chinese fast food places in my hometown."}
{"text":"I have been to many different Panda Express locations.  Some in malls, some drive thru, some walk up.  I have found the food to be pretty consistant and decent.  It was about 5:30 on a Saturday evening and I had just finished running some errands.  I saw the Panda Express and thought that would be a good option since I have been experiencing a medical issue and I am not supposed to be on my feet for too long.  I pulled in and took a quick glace at my options.  When the server came up to take my order she acted as if she could care less.  I asked for string bean chicken but upon close look it appeared as if it had been sitting there for most of the afternoon.  I said to her \"those beans do not look good\"  Her response was \"do you still want it?\"  Really??  No, no and no!  I got the broccoli beef instead but it was not much better upon tasting it when I got home.  I also got the honey walnut shrimp. The coating was rubbery, not crisp, which would indicate to me that most of the food had been sitting around for some time.  The server should have asked if I would like to wait while they made a fresh batch.  That would have been good customer service.  Instead she got my order together, rang it up, and that was that. No thank you or anything.  And there was one other person being waited on while I was there.  It was not as if they were swamped with people.  Sorry but I'm not sure I will be going back to this particular location.  There are others near me that have done a far better job.  Management needs to do a check on their employees and refresh their memories as to what good customer service really is and how to achieve that.  I also gave them my opinion since they offer a free entree for filling out their survey online.  Hopefully someone will get the point."}
{"text":"The food is always great at this location.  This store is always clean and the bathrooms are usually spotless.  I eat here on average of 2-3 times per week(I'm a widowed male and cooking for one is not for me).  But today the food was exceptional.  I even called the store directly and talked to manager Nelson about how great everything tasted tonight.  He has good control over his store and is also excellent with the customers.  Matthew was my food server tonight and is always pleasant with a big smile on his face.  Tonight the store was out of the fresh mixed vegetables, but Matthew offered to make them up fresh for me, for which I was happy to wait.  Nelson cooked the vegetables and they were perfect.  Matthew even offered me a small fountain beverage while I waited.  Also, though I did not see Rosa tonight, she is another 5 Star employee in my book.  She is always smiling, always helpful, and is always very friendly.  Sincerely, Curtis Osborne"}
{"text":"Just yuck..  my 1st choice of fast food failed because it closed early.. so my husband said panda..   wow years since ive been here and what a sad mess.. everyone in front of me wanted stuff they were out of ..  place was busy but out of food.. lots of walk outs and people waiting 6-10 mins for orders.. i dont eat fast food but wanted  egg roll but they were so burnt cooked by untrained or lazy people.  Soooo yucky.."}
{"text":"Guess my taste buds are changing as I get older!  I love this place now!  I love all the shrimp dishes!  The walnut shrimp is crunchy and sweet yes with walnuts in them.  OMG, I was in heaven.  I haven't been in a Panda Express for over 7 yrs.  Now that I've revisited it, I love it."}
{"text":"Drive Thru Review:   Each time I've gone the drive thru has been considerably slow. Average about 15 minutes.   I tried again, when there were zero cars in the drive thru and the wait was still 10 minutes.   Definitely not great for a \"quick\" drive thru.   The food was cold the first two times, but was better recently."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my chicken, and it's like COOKED in, and I think it's a cat hair or a dog hair. It's thick, short, and white. I don't have white hair or white haired animals. Also the last time I came in the older man ringing me up asked if I wanted to round up to the next dollar and donate my change and I said no thank you (I donate to charities on my own), and he smiled and rounded it up anyway. That's something small, and I don't know if he did it intentionally because he figured I'd feel too awkward to ask him to reverse that, or if he somehow mistook \"No thank you,\" for, \"Yes.\" Either way, I did not appreciate that.  Edit: So I tossed the piece of chicken with a cat/dog hair, and picked up another piece - and that one had a hair too. I'm done, this is going in the trash. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"What can be said about this location that hasn't been said about any Panda location... drive thru!  That's honestly the best part about this place. He food is standard panda quality which is good... enough. I've never gone in this store, so I can't say much about the cleanliness but the drive thru employee was kind.   Not bad for some quick Chinese cuisine"}
{"text":"Every single time I come into this place, I get horrible treatment from one of their employees. It's not just me, it's everyone who walks through the door. I haven't gotten her name but she def needs to be fired because of how rudely she treats customers. My visit a couple of months ago was the last straw with me. I had placed an order online for pick up for me and my hubby. I arrived 2 minutes after the time it was scheduled to be ready. When I approached the \"pick up\" counter, guess what employee decided to help me.... so the rude girl asks me for my name and I tell her, so she looks it up on her computer. She can't find it so I show her the receipt on my phone. She looked through that email for what felt like 10 minutes and was scrolling non stop trying to make sure it was legit. and then she handed another employee my phone so that they could confirm that my receipt was in fact for that date, time and location. I was so embarrassed because they made it seem that I was lying and trying to get free food. So finally after like 15 minutes the rude girl tells me that I have to wait for one of the entrees to cook because they had just run out. I had to wait another 25 minutes for the food to be ready and not once did I get an apology for the inconvenience. The point of ordering online is so that I don't have to wait there! I was here waiting for more than 40 mins! I love Panda Express but I will never set foot in this specific location ever again. (Unless that rude girl is fired lol)"}
{"text":"Blah... I really don't know why I keep going to Panda. Maybe its my undying love for chinese food? Maybe its because its quick and convenient? Maybe I'm crazy?  Still yet to have anything more than an average experience at any Panda Express location yet I keep going. But I need to feed my cravings for chinese food in between jobs and this is the quickest and easiest way to do that without dropping too much money on the strip.  Food never seems to be hot and its average tasting at best. Yesterday I had the usual 2 item combo. This time I ordered chow mein as my side, chicken and green beans as option 1 and beef and broccoli as option 2. The chicken and green beans was flavorful but not hot enough. The beef was good but the broccoli was terrible.  Pluses for this location are its easily accessible and right across the street from Mandalay Bay. Its clean and the lady behind the counter was nice and gave me good size portions. Plenty of seating indoors and out.  Wish I could say I wouldn't go back but sometimes you do what you have to do. Chinese food why do I love you so much?!"}
{"text":"Ok... strange right? I'm usually anti-Panda but to be honest.... I have been eating at this one for the past two weeks every few days and the food has been good. My only complaint about this one is the fact that the people serving the food all have varying portions. One day I feel like I'm getting barely anything and I'm still hungry, the next day I can't even finish my food. I have been ordering the same dish the past few times and the food has been fresh and very tasty.  I order the 2 item and 1 side combo plate. My side is fried rice when it looks fresh and I accompany that with Sweet Fire Chicken as item 1 and Mandarin Chicken as item 2.   I was skeptical to try the Sweet Fire Chicken at first because I don't like spicy foods and it has a spicy sticker next to it.. but the guy behind the counter told me it just had a small kick to it. He let me try a piece and it was deicious.  I must say.... Panda has grown on me. Hope they keep up with the quality, fresh food that I have been getting recently."}
{"text":"If I would've written this a year ago, it would've gotten 5 stars however the quality of their food seems to have gone down drastically. As a family, we'd eat there once or sometimes twice a week. But after our last few visits, we won't be going back for a while. Also, there is limited seating for larger groups."}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option, that would be their rating!   Time after time I give this location a chance and the lines are so slow.  I am currently 10 cars back in the drive thru while they take 5 minutes per car!  Ugh!  I could drive to the next closest location and home faster than waiting in this line.  So frustrating!!"}
{"text":"I usually get bad service here but today was the worst. I decided I wanted some Asian food so I went by the drive thru because I didn't felt like getting out, when I ordered they told me that the teriyaki chicken was going to take 6 minutes so I told them that was fine. After paying they asked me if I could go wait to the front because they had a line and I said that they did the same thing to me last time and that I never got my food I had to go in and get it. They assured me that it would not happen again, so I said fine I'll go to the front. I waited for 15 minutes and I never got my food when I went inside to see what was going on they told me they gave the last of the chicken to someone on the drive thru and I had to wait again. At this point I was upset and I complained and asked for a refund but the manager did not cared or apologized. This is the worst I been to."}
{"text":"I LOVE Panda Express. When I found out they created an app you could order food on I was over the moon. Panda Express is literally everything to me. At least it was before today. I was having a really rough day and jonesin for some of their chow mein and fried rice (it always makes me feel better). I decided to take a lunch break instead of spending my lunch cooped up at the office as planned and headed on over to the nearest PE. When I pulled up to their drive through it took the counter girl approximately five minutes to say anything to me, and when her voice finally came over the speaker it was unwelcoming. After ordering and pulling up to the window I was asked if I wanted any soy sauce or sweet and sour. I said no. I paid for my meal drove off. When I got back to the office I noticed that I was given soy sauce and sweet and sour despite my \"no thank you\" which is extremely wasteful. I over looked this and excitedly dove into my Panda Bowl (figuratively not literally) only to find that I didn't have any fried rice in my bowl, only chow mein. Disappointing but what can you do? The deed's been done. I continued eating only to choke on a bone from my mushroom chicken a couple minutes later which not only grossed me out but made me fear for my life for a brief moment. You've done me dirty, Panda. You've done me dirty."}
{"text":"After waiting in line for 15 minutes...get to the front only to find out they've run out of food...but they didn't tell anyone in line...so dumb.   At least have the courtesy to make an announcement to the crowd when there's a line 20 people deep.   Ridiculous."}
{"text":"VERY stingy. I've been going to Panda for years and I don't know if it's just this location but this place will give u one scoop of meat with 10 scoops of rice. I get rice bowls and I still see my rice after they put the meat on top. The employee said they only give one scoop; today with the shrimp, they say it's only 5 pieces and I'd seen majority of my rice with the shrimp."}
{"text":"Total garbage tonight. I understand it's 'airport food' so I expect a step down in quality but tonight's selection was terrible.  First the line was ridiculous...I can tolerate that if the crew is efficient. (They were not)  Second, half the entree selections were sold out. (8:15pm)  Third, my chow mein tasted burned. The \"chef' either had the heat up way too high or forgot he was cooking for a while.  Lastly, the mushrooms in my Shanghai  Beef were cold! How do you possibly butcher everything this bad.  I was tempted to take this trash back for a refund but ultimately the line was even longer than it was earlier.  Epic failure Panda!!"}
{"text":"What is it with this place?  Since moving to the valley over 18 months ago my daughters have been enamored with this place.  Actually it is starting to wane, thank God.  How are these things all over the place?  Can't we make them get back to the mall food courts where they belong?  They are the McDonald's of Chinese food aren't they?  When I lived back east we didn't let these McChinese places get out of hand.    Valley residents have obviously not put them in their place in the scheme of things.  Bad Chinese food fast!"}
{"text":"2 stars due to the place being very dirty  (food on tables and floor) very unkept. Server was manager and his portions were on the light side. Typical panda food quality though."}
{"text":"Usually I love coming but tonight there was not only one but 2 hairs in my takeout. So grossed out and probably never coming back. Needless to say, I threw it out. Whatever happened to hair nets?!"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because it is designed as a fast food Asian joint and is not a fancy, sit down type restaurant. Everything else about this place is stellar. You literally have over a dozen things to select from to build your plate. I'm a sucker for orange chicken and this place does it perfectly. Also their shrimp here is fantastic. Whenever I'm in Parma visiting my buddy, we tend to pick this place over other options. Good value and great food make this place a no-brainer."}
{"text":"Had to wait 20 min for our meal and then they forgot some of it. Terrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!TRASH!!!if I could I would give -5 .we were on the run and we need to grab something fast with this and Mc Donald's next to it, we thought that this was a better choice  but we were wrong. Food was old ,taste disgusting,rice was dry ,looks like day or two old. Chicken selection was very minimal on the chicken,looked old and greasy.One plate costs $9.  We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Hands down best panda express iv ever been to!!! the manager shawn is awesome!!!! Thank you for the to wonderful service an great food!!"}
{"text":"When I want something quick and easy...Panda Express is always a favorite of mine!! Food is pretty much always tasty (especially the teriyaki chicken & string bean chicken) and service is always good"}
{"text":"Today is my first order. I was excited when I got the meal. It looks really good. But I didn't expect to be disappointed, I ate a hair in the noodles. What a disgusting thing! I dare not eat it again! I'm really disappointed. I don't think I'll order here any more."}
{"text":"Slowest Panda ever. Only two people in front of me and it still took 10 minutes to get to me."}
{"text":"Seems to be always understaffed and a long wait. Only one person serving food and a long line today made it even worse than before."}
{"text":"I decided to give Panda Express a try after driving past it multiple times. It's your typical Chinese food. The format reminds me exactly of what you would see in a mall food court. However, the food at Panda Express is definitely better quality than you would find in a mall. I decided to go with the big plate, where you get three entrees and one side. The portion sizes are big and the food is fresh. Fast service and friendly workers.  The cream cheese rangoons were mediocre at best. I might be a little biased because I prefer crab rangoons, but the cream cheese ones were definitely bland and lacking in flavor.   I would say that overall, I enjoyed my meal. The taste was what you would expect at a normal Chinese restaurant. Would I return? Yes. Would I go out of my way to return? Probably not."}
{"text":"Service is good, but food is terrible!  Soggy, greasy egg rolls have no taste. The Beef/broccoli  was not edible. Very Very disappointed, I will not return to this establishment.  The price for the food is more than what i pay for a sit down Chinese restaurant.  And they charge you  1.35 for a fortune cookie!!!"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at Metro PCS, I went through the drive through to get some lunch on the fly.  5 stars for the cheerful and efficient gal at the drive thru window. The food is always consistently good."}
{"text":"I've been to several Panda Express' through the years and all of them were what I expect from a Panda Express. We were craving Panda so we decided to go to this one while we were in Downtown Summerlin. It was my first time to this location and I was quite pleased to see that it had long tables that could seat groups of 8-10 people.   I ordered my usual steamed veggies and Beijing beef.   With one scoop left of the steamed veggies sitting in the serving pan they automatically made a fresh batch instead of adding the last scoop to my plate. They didn't ask if I wanted the last scoop.They just told me they would make a fresh batch, so there would be a 5 minute wait. I'd rather have some freshly cooked veggies, I really really appreciated that! It's like they read my mind.   The service from the women creating our plates were definitely better than other Panda Express I've been to. The crowd rolled in right after I ordered so there were at least 10 people behind me. They were great at keeping the line moving.   When I got to the cashier, I usually ask for water. But I noticed the Panda Tea Bar menu! This location has a tea bar! This was the first time I've seen the Panda Tea Bar so I decided to try it. As I scanned the menu, I noticed there were a variety of milk teas, fruit teas, lemonades, shakes, smoothies, Vietnamese coffee, sea salt cream & a lot more to choose from! There's also options to choose your sweetness level, toppings and type of tea. I ordered a Thai Tea with boba and 25% sweetness. Not bad! And the amount of boba they added was a good amount. I was happy with it.   I had to wait a few more minutes for the steamed veggies, but I didn't mind because the girl helping me updated me every few minutes. I was quite pleased with their customer service. At most Pandas I've been to, service has always been okay. But here they kicked it up a notch while they were busy. I was quite impressed with that.   When I finally tasted my veggies and Beijing beef, it was delicious. I was happy with it.  This is no where near where I live, but with all the amazing service I've got at restaurants and shops I've been to in Downtown Summerlin, I'm considering moving to this area. I'll definitely be back to this Panda Express."}

Its in a nice location and very clean as well as friendly staff! My sister and I always come to Panda when we want something good and cheap..   Orange chicken is very yummy and their fried rice is really good too. Although I'm a huge fan of their chow mein and vegie eggrolls..they are to die for! :)"}
{"text":"WOMEN: Have a promotional modeling gig at an expo or desperately need to lose 5 pounds in a short amount of time to make that bikini look good? Come to the Tropicana Panda Express located near the Bank of America and order the Fire Cracker Chicken.  MEN: Have a weigh in for a fight tomorrow in the UFC and are currently 5-7 pounds over your weight class and don't want to be docked points on the score card? Come to the Tropicana Panda Express located near the Bank of America and order the Fire Cracker Chicken.  I usually don't review fast food restaurants because everyone's been there and already have their own opinions but I had a unique experience at the one on Tropicana...  Had the fire cracker chicken and it tasted excellent. Portions are small and the place makes 2000% profit on white rice (which I usually don't get) charging $2 for something that costs a dime to make, no thanks.  The real fun began about 30 minutes after the meal. Explosive diarrhea (from bad chicken, I presume) that had me running to the bathroom a dozen times in a 4 hour period til there was nothing left in my stomach.  ...and to me that earns a 3-star \"A-OK\"  Casino pools are due to open soon and I can now see my abs in the mirror. I may specifically visit this location the night before I'm due to spend a day in California at the beach or if I have friends in town who want to visit the casino pool..  Plus you get quality alone time away from your girlfriend/boyfriend to comb facebook and play candy crush on your smart phone while you are locked away in the bathroom for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Very clean and convenient location located right on the corner of Sahara and Nellis. This location gets high volume of customers but the line moves quite quickly. The good thing about this location constantly being busy is that the food is always fresh! You could tell things are fresh as all of the veggie dishes usually consist of crispy vegetables. The staff is very courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Have been here quite a number of times since this place opened--it's never a quick, easy experience, but the food is usually tasty, so I always cave in and give it another chance.  No more.  The poor food handling by the employees at this location is simply repulsive.  Several times I have witnessed multiple employees bare-handing a scoop of vegetables into the wok--no gloves, no handwashing, just grabbing a fistful of veggies and tossing them into the skillet.  On another visit, I watched an employee empty the trash can from the dining area, toss it through a backroom door from the prep area and immediately return to spooning entrees into the foam containers, making no attempt to rinse off his hands, let alone wash them thoroughly!  These have got to be health code violations.  Here's hoping the employees don't have open cuts on their hands and at least have the sense to wash hands after using the bathroom, but why would they, if they don't seem to think there's anything wrong with their current actions on the prep floor?  Sorry, Panda, I'm done with second, third, umpteenth chances.  Management needs to retrain their employees and take proper health practices seriously or it's doubtful this location will last very long."}
{"text":"How is it possible to mess up Chinese food you may ask?  Just come here during dinner time and you too can find out.  Pretty basic recipes just duplicated to death so they should know how to make it.  The beef and broccoli was very rushed as the broccoli was still cool compared to the really hot meat, not a lot of flavor with the sweet and sour pork, and the fried rice was still hard.  I've been here many times and had really good food.  Maybe it was an off night for the crew so I will go back and give it another chance.  Orange chicken is the way to go."}
{"text":"Before you freak out on me about how Panda Express isn't really food.  I KNOW!  I will cover that.  I usually don't like chain restaurants, and if you are eating here, it is probably because you are in a hurry, and choices are limited.  It isn't really \"real\" food, but sometimes you've just got to do what you've got to do.  Not a place I would eat daily or even weekly,  but there are a few things I like here:  1.  The iced tea is great.  2.  Their chili paste (comes in a little packet on the side) is quite good, actually a bit spicy, and can make their uninteresting fare flavorful.  3.  Entree:  The Sweet Fire Chicken with the above mentioned chili paste added is a fairly good fast food meal. It is basically breaded, fried, and candied chicken breast meat, so take it for what you will.  4.  If you get vegetables rather than the noodles or rice, it really starts to resemble something quasi healthy, which it still isn't, but  do what ya gotta do to get through the day."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS  RACIST EMPLOYEES   I asked for double General Tso's and apparently that's a outlandish request. So what if you have to make more! Your not closed for another hour! Make more! I'll wait!   He asked me what I wanted but than continued to yell across the store to another employee. I had to wait for him to shut up so I could order.   Every Hispanic person who walked in was greeted! One lady even requested fresh chicken to be made when the one wasn't even empty. His response to her was sure no problem and told her it would be 7 minutes! YEA IM WHITE AS A GHOST BUT I ALSO SPEAK SPANISH!   So next time don't assume I can't understand you complaining about me! Assholes."}
{"text":"So for starters, terrible customer service, matter of fact i didnt receive any costomer service at all after arriving at 10:30 closing time saying 11 on the door and sitting in the drive through with no respinse for about 15 minutes we tried to then walk inside as we saw a full staff inside and lights on it appeared open. But the doors were locked a half hour early and they wouldn't acknowledge the faslct we were at the door. Then a few younger girs in dresses \"friends of workers\" end up knocking on the door and the employes let them in and go in the back with them to hang out. Honestly first and last time going here. And dont reccomend it unless you want to sit around and wait for nothing ha. Posted sat june 23rd 10:57 pm still before closing time"}
{"text":"I've tried several times to give them a break but no more. Customer service is always great but they don't wanna give you food and 7 dollars for two scoops of rice and barely a whole scoop of chicken with mushrooms. Go inside if you want to get some of what you pay for never the drivethru. I had high hopes even went to another one across town n they were worse than were I go no more Panda for me."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Panda Express because of all the hullabaloo I've heard about it...but I should start by saying I am not to any degree typically a \"fast food\" kind of guy. My 10 year old son is anti-fast food. We just don't do it. But hey, we just got in town from a 3-week vacation, had to food shop, got haircuts across the street...I was in no mood to cook...so we gave it a try, seeing the new location and given what I'd heard about it... ...and it did not disappoint at all. Pretty darned good, actually! What is up with that Chow Mein? That stuff is banging! Heck, I'm so tired right now I don't exactly remember what we had specifically...oh! - but they do offer samples! Chicken with green beans, some other chicken thing...the boy had chow mein, rice, some beef stuff he devoured with broccoli.  Hey...nice staff, the place was clean, the food was really good (I want like six pounds of chow mein to go...)...yeah...we could make an exception and do this again. Goes well with haircuts...lol!"}
{"text":"Dont eat here...just got food poisoning from their shrimp last night"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that if I could give this specific store a lower rating, I would. About two weeks ago we went through the drive through on the way home. As we live in Tonopah, this is the closest location to us. When we got home we quickly realized that our whole order was wrong. In my order of mushroom chicken, I had TWO whole pieces of chicken! My boyfriends order was missing an entree, and the food he did get was all wrong. So I called the store and spoke with a manager, where he kindly apologized and offered us 20% off our next order. Flash forward to tonight when I decided to give them another try. I went inside to make sure our entire order was correct. When it came time to pay I mentioned that the manager took down my name so that I could get the discount. The lady said it could not be given to me without a receipt. So I paid for our food and went to fill my drink (lady didn't give me my food until they checked on the discount.) When one of the ladies came back from the office explained that I should have mentioned the discount before paying because refunding the order would be a difficult process (although that was the first thing I mentioned while she was ringing up my order.) I told her not to worry about it as I didn't want to inconvenience her or the rest of the people in line. As I was walking out, one of your employees who was clearly off the clock and eating pizza inside the store (serious health code violation!) decided to start talking about me before I even reached the door, so professional (calling me a fatass is not the best thing to do in uniform, especially with a name tag on!) After reading these reviews, I wonder how you guys are still in business. The manager needs to get this store together before you really start losing business. Clearly this manager is more concerned about young \"hot\" employees than he is about customer service. These children are so rude!"}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant 10:12pm and it says states on the door that the drive-thru is open till 10:30pm. However, they had a chair blocking the drive-thru. I walked in and they said they were closed. I told them it says they're open till 10:30pm. They told me they had no food."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed dinner from here and after we got home I got half way through my dinner bowl when we found a little black beetle dead in the rice.  My husband called there just to let them know and the manager was arguing with him and telling him to bring it in and prove it and she'd give him free food.  We didn't want free food we just wanted to let them know so maybe they would check their rice but she kept arguing with him and was mad at us for finding the bug and telling them about it.  If she would have been appreciative and concerned even pretend to be concerned we wouldn't be writing this review thinking she checked it out and all was good, but she acted like it was our fault.  So we are telling all of YOU about it since I highly doubt they will check their food and then of course we will not be eating there again and I wouldn't advise anyone else eating there either.  We are sending a letter to their corporate offices and Nevada health board."}
{"text":"This place has nice staff but terrible food. The rice was raw and the beef tasted sour. I don't know maybe we got the bad luck of the draw, but probably not because I ordered same thing in Avon and it was bad too."}
{"text":"This drive thru couldn't be slower if they tried. I'm hoping they hatched an egg and nurtured the chicken till adulthood, then made it into orange chicken in as long as it took to get through this line. If a manager or owner ever reads this, please check in on your store in the evenings, like around 8:30pm.  As a benefit of the long wait, by the time I finally got my order I qualified for the senior discount....."}
{"text":"As I've conveyed previously, the layout of this restaurant is NOT ergonomic. The small front foyer isn't large enough for a line that forms and one can't see the entree's from the vantage point. My one issue on this visit was I ordered the Shanghai Angus beef dish which has a $1.25 premium and the server gave me a smaller than usual portion and even worse fewer bites of savory 'steak' than vegetables and mushrooms. Disappointing. Other than that I really love the food and the flavors!"}
{"text":"So many health code violations, I saw the cashier handle cash and coins then immediately proceed to handle food right after. The person in a black shirt, I'm assuming is the manager was standing right next to the cashier and didn't say a word. The cashier then proceeded to go into the lobby clean the counter and soda area and go right back to handling food without washing her hands. Good job Panda Express."}
{"text":"Been here 20+times in the last year. Typically slow but today was the worst. 3 cars in front of me and it took 22 minutes to get my food. I was offers a 10% discount. Which would have been nice,  but when I got home my order was incorrect.  I was given the excuse that they ran out of cooked food. If that's the case, where was the management?  Where was the coordination making sure the cooks were on top of things? Not cool for lunch time."}
{"text":"There is a Panda down the street from my house, but I usually drive 10 extra minutes to get to this location instead. It's fast food, so your expectations can't be too high. That said, I have always had excellent and prompt service. The location is ideal and parking lot is ample in size.   The dining area is clean, and this location rarely has the long lines some of the other locations in Vegas and Henderson have.   Others have questioned the food quality, but from my experience I have always received food prepared the way I expect from Panda Express.   Weekends during warmer months can get a bit busy as people stop by here on the way to and from the lake. Otherwise, I rarely see a crowd piled up at the entrance like at some of the Henderson counterparts."}
{"text":"Newly opened US fast Chinese food chain in the developing East Hills shopping area. When I went in it was busy, every table taken and a lineup at the counter. The line moved quickly except for if you were paying with a card, the machine was super slow.   I picked a 1 entree and side bowl with Beijing Beef and fried rice. It was pretty good, about what you would expect from fast food. It was like sweet and sour beef with a little heat, not much. I would like to try some of the other dishes so I can find a favourite and hopefully one that would stand out.  I also ordered an egg roll. Now this I really enjoyed! Of course, I'm always a fan of New York style egg rolls.  The warm sweet and sour sauce they gave with it was so yummy! Kind of an orange hint and I swear a bit of pineapple flavour too.  However there's two disappointments to the egg rolls: 1-No hot mustard. Was told it's only available in the US. Booo.  2- The $2.40 price tag for 1 egg roll. That's pretty expensive but I suppose I'm spoiled in the fact I used it I get 2 for $3 at my local Chinese restaurant down home in the US with hot mustard.   I'm super glad Panda Express is here to offer more variety to our fast food scene and it looks like they're off to a good start!"}
{"text":"I think of Panda Express as \"mall food.\"  in fact, this is the first time I've ever seen a location outside of a mall. But we wanted something quick and cheap for lunch and we were passing by.  I agree with the other reviews, slow as can be! They had THREE people putting orders together and not one person on the register?!?  The funny thing is besides my self and my husband, there were only 2 other people ordering. We're not talking about a line out the door here, people.   The food was good. I think for the price, we got plenty.   But the biggest highlight of the whole meal was the drum roll please..........the CHORK!!!  Who knew?!?!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service isn't great. I went in last night and the two guys ahead of me in line either worked there or knew most of the staff. There were 6 people working behind the counter and 5 of them were chopping it up with the two guys in line ahead of me. The cook was included in this. The first girl took my order on my sides and said the next group of people would take my entree orders. While I sat and waited a couple minutes for someone to pay attention to me and get the rest of my order instead of b.s.ing with the guys ahead of me, the last of what I wanted (honey sesame chicken) was grabbed for a car in the drive thru line. Because the cook was socializing instead of doing his job, they were running low on a few things and didnt have any back up ready and I wasn't going to wait around for them to get more honey sesame chicken made, so I chose something else.   Also, my husband always gets the teriyaki chicken and he said the sauce seems to be watered down since when they first opened.   I am a manager of a team of customer service reps so customer service is very important to me. They are seriously lacking in this arena and need to have a manager on duty. If there was, there needs to be a more mature manager on duty as everyone but the cook seemed to be of high school age."}
{"text":"We got cheated on with meat, wasn't the correct portion size, I saw a girl \"mouthing the words this dudes an asshole\" I was given attitude when I asked for more meat, I'm not gonna pay $14 for barely any food. I asked politely I wasn't being aggressive but she shouldn't be working anymore, her name is Daniela"}
{"text":"For the record I love Panda Express when it hits the standards. The fact there was only one car here on a Saturday night at 7:30pm should have been an indicator.   I've never had such awful quality at a Panda Express. Glad I'm just visiting the area because I'd be bummed if this was the Panda I was stuck with.  I ordered a large orange chicken and there were several large crunchy pieces that had zero sauce on them. I also ordered a medium white rice and neither of the cartons were full as is usual for Panda.   Then there's the service. For being completely dead (one whole car in the drive through) it sure seemed tough for Deja K. to multitask. When the (only) car ahead of me had finished ordering and pulled up to the window I was greeted and told she'd be right with me. After several minutes the car at the window left. I continued to wait very patiently at the speaker, but even after more than a full minute went by after the car left I was still waiting to place my order. Assuming I'd been forgotten I piped up and finally had my order taken. The order screen was out of order, and I was told I'd get my order at the window. So I pull up and that's exactly what I got. No \"Hello\", \"Sorry for your wait\", \"Thank you for being patient\".....just \"$14.22\" and a hand out the window waiting for my payment.   Manager/owner: look around... there is no shortage of fast food restaurants around you. People will easily (and clearly do) choose to go elsewhere where they know they can get good quality food and good service."}
{"text":"Good location. Clean. But I have a suspicion that they serve the freshest food in the dining room. Every time I go to the drive through its not very fresh."}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss,,sometimes it s fresh and sometimes its cold and old.  I guess it's ok.  Skip this if you have a chance to go to a regular Chinese joint."}
{"text":"Considering it's fast-food Chinese....I give it a big 3. The restaurant was clean and the employees were well groomed. Meh"}
{"text":"I have been sitting in the driveway for 25 minutes now. Still two cars in front of me that haven't moved yet. No warning that the service was behind."}
{"text":"When I got in it was busy so I looked for a table all tables were dirty and they had a number of workers one of them coulda been in the dining area cleaning first time ever I ate at pandas and my portion was smaller than ever and white rice was old ish"}
{"text":"Its ok. It's it is a chain restaurant remember. The food is typically okay. The staff is always friendly. But they are a little skimpy. And sometimes depending on when you go in food isn't always as fresh as it should be. But overall it's not that bad. We continue to go back so it must be ok."}
{"text":"i hate reviewing fast food chains.. do i really have to yelp???well  youre telling me to so ok. Orange Chicken, Bejing Beef, pork Spare Ribs, Walnut Shrimp are amongst my favorites dont forget to order some cream cheese wontons."}
{"text":"After an AWFUL experience eating at Teriyaki Madness (BTW is directly across the street from Panda), I decided to once again go eat at Panda Express. I am glad I did, the portions are huge, the food is always hot and customer service is superior. I will never eat at Teriyaki Madness again, the name BTW is fitting because the owner DEAN at TM is off his rocker! Thank you Panda for always providing us with quality and quantity!"}
{"text":"Food was overcooked.  Employees not helpful and didn't pay any attention to the order placed.  They were also rude.  This is based on four visits to this particular stand alone store.  I will not visit this store again!"}
{"text":"I had to post this from my early dinner yesterday at Panda...   I was rushed and went there to get a quick dinner.   I'm not a huge fan of \"Chinese fast food\" but I do crave it every once in a while.   I went yesterday to have Kung Pao chicken.   The new Firecracker chicken caught my eye so I got that, white rice and fresh veggies.  Omg!  This was the best Panda meal ever!   To top it off my receipt had a voucher to redeem for a free entree.   I will be redeeming that within days for more Firecracker!   Well done Panda!"}
{"text":"I've never been so happy to go to one place  all the time but every time I go the food is warm and not old . The restrooms are always clean and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"I gave this place one star because I couldn't give it anything less. This is the 3rd time that they screw up my order. Maybe if they paid attention the first time the customer wouldn't have to come back and waste their time. How hard it is to add the correct food to the plate?!"}
{"text":"You get what you expect from Panda Express... Consistency. Service is good- they've had alot of the same staff for a while and the place is clean. Cream cheese ragoons can be a little toasty.... But overall I enjoy my meals from here!"}
{"text":"Food was cold on two occasions, salty, MSG rich, and expensive. I've had better. I would say move on and look for another."}
{"text":"This is one of the cleanest most friendliest Panda Express I've ever been to! I only ordered potstickers, which I had to wait for, but it was OK because I was waiting for a sub from Jersey Mikes next door and my potstickers which were ordered after the sub and had 2 b cooked were done b4 my ham & cheese sandwich! The servers were super nice & offered me a complimentary drink while I waited. This was my first visit 2 this store & I'm definitely going 2 make it my number 1 store. It's spacious & clean & the food looked hot & fresh."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most disorganized and lackadaisical Panda Express crew in the USA. You walk in and they keep you waiting for 10 minutes while they deal with all the drive-ups. When they finally get to you they are always out of something (usually steamed veggies) so you've got to wait another 5-10 minutes for them to fill your order. This wasn't a one-time occurrence; same thing has happened to us four or five times in a row now. We've finally learned our lesson. There's a Pei Wei across the street. Next time we go there."}
{"text":"Came here to have lunch before a trip to Walmart. I'm not a big fan of Panda Express since I am accustomed to authentic Asian food, but at the same time it's not terrible enough to hate. This is a clean restaurant, but the portions were pretty stingy. At most Pandas they will give you a ton of rice and noodles to at least make up for the stinginess of the entrees (if they are even stingy with the entrees, it really depends on the person serving you), but not at this location. My bf pointed out that perhaps if we had ordered it for there we might have gotten more. I do like the outdoor seating. It's facing the parking lot, not the street, which made it quieter and more relaxing to eat outside. We'll probably be back to order our food for there, and hopefully they will not be so stingy."}
{"text":"5 star more so for the employee named Antonio he is very friendly and his customer service is on point. He made our visit very pleasant! We will be returning to this location more often!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the servers was very nice and patient.. this was my first time here and they took there time to explain and let me try different thinks .. I will be back forsure!!!!"}
{"text":"The food at this Panda Express is fine but the rice? Not so good. They can never get it right. I've been coming here for awhile but the rice is always undercooked. Come on if this is an Asian restaurant, you have to at least cook the rice right. Some days it's edible and some days it's so hard it's almost raw. I would give it 4 stars because they have great service but because of the undercooked rice I give it one star."}
{"text":"Updated review: I've generally been satisfied with Panda Express (see review below) but today's experience sucked. There was only 1 staff member working the whole restaurant and when I brought my food home, the veggies were overcooked and the spring roll soggy. It was just sad!"}
{"text":"Lines can get very long if the Service isn't handled correctly. Food on the other hand is good. I recommend coming when it is between Lunch and dinner to be in and out ;)"}
{"text":"Clearly we are insane because we gave this location yet another chance after not eating here for months and yet again both me and my boyfriend were violently ill after eating there Friday night. This will definitely not happen again."}
{"text":"The service started great with a warm and inviting greeting, proper smile, and genuine thank you. I ordered the orange chicken with steamed brown rice.  The food was good. I was extremely impressed with the level of cleanliness in this location. The floors, including the tile grout were deep cleaned and I was impressed.  The overall cleanliness was awesome, and something that I pay close attention to while eating out.   This is now  my goto eatery!"}
{"text":"Food good, service good, girl at cash register needs to learn to smile.  The place looked clean and everything tastes good.    But the girl at the register left a bad taste in my mouth.   If you're in a bad mood at work, you need to learn to FAKE IT and smile and treat customers with respect.  B"}
{"text":"The food is very good. The portions were excellent and service with a smile.  We took ours to go and we definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite food choices in the mall.  Today we went there and they were out of two items we wanted.  They immediately cooked them! We had very little wait time and it was worth the wait!! We also had great service with smiles!!"}
{"text":"slow as fuck! still waiting for food at least 20 min after order i have to write more so heres this! this place sucks ok yo dont come here lmaooooo"}
{"text":"Good, fast and friendly service.  Nice clean restaurant. Food is standard PE, so good but nothing special.  Stopped by because teenagers were hungry from shopping and a stop at Costco to fill up their college apartment galley.  It is behind the LongHorn Steakhouse, easy to miss."}
{"text":"Not only does this place smells, but also I went and got a couple of sides on a small bowl I mean just a little bit ( no entrees just plain fried rice on a bowl)  for my sons lunch they charged me $5 bucks. ( not being a cheapy but I thought that was a lot for a couple so scoops without an entree.).The Panda Express on stephanie is the way to go. Super clean and have wonderful people working there. Sigh! I have been having a bad experience on all the businesses in this plaza except for the great  dog grooming place next door! Yayyyy! Go for real Chinese food! :)"}
{"text":"Good friendly service.  Nice clean restaurant. Food is standard PE, so good but nothing special.  Stopped by because teenagers were hungry after afternoon of volunteering."}
{"text":"I like Panda Express! One night my hubby and I went through the drive thru and the kid at the window was so friendly and personable! He definitely made my night. I'd give this one five stars except that they messed up our mobile orders quite a few times. Other than that, they are great. :)"}
{"text":"We will NEVER darken the door to this establishment again.  I always try to find at least one positive thing about a business. Unfortunately I've got nada."}
{"text":"I have a tip, not just for the poorly performing Panda Express locations in Surprise, but for all sad-sack restaurants....how about you stop wasting everyone's time by typing apologies and, instead sending someone into the stores to kick some butt?  When one sees dozens of one star reviews, followed by canned apologies, no one is impressed.  I would actually rather see no management responses at all than these stupid \"I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah, I'll let management know.\"  (Hey, management ain't listening!)"}
{"text":"Very displeased. Due to food experience I politely waited about 10minutes for new food to be prepared & when I got home my fried rice was disgusting. It had no flavor whatsoever! Tasted very plain & soggy. If the rest of the food was freshly prepared why wasn't the rice ?  & it takes up more than half my plate. WHAT DID I PAY FOR ?!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely one of my worst visit to panda express! The service is absolutely horrible!!! Now I understand that and except this is a busy place, but  please.... employees act like they don't want to work, they're not moving, they got attitude. There's one bathroom available balance broken, the place is a pigsty, trash everywhere, no forks, tables are dirty!  Why do people come here? It's like they could care less if you are there. I accidentally dropped my side of broccoli (which was their fault anyway because it was suppose to be 1/2 & 1/2) & the lady looked like I committed some great sin/crime. I want my money back!!!!! I've been looking at the responses back from Panda Express corporate, wake up guys! For more than 10 months you've been saying that you are going to address these complaints with the store manager & this same issues keep popping up. If you have no intentions in solving them, then don't say so!!! Oh, soooo upset!"}
{"text":"The fried rice and lo mein is always fresh. Last week I had the beef and broccoli, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Just got here at 9:48pm on  a Saturday night. Says theyre open until 10:30pm. Was asked if I wanted to hear \"what they had left,\" none of which were orange chicken or honey seared like I was about to order. I asked why they weren't making food if they didnt close for another 45 minutes. Girl just paused and stated well it'll be 10-15 minutes. Wasnt trying to have my food spit in so I left. What possible logic is there in not at least making sure you have orange chicken on the last hour of a saturday night?? Trash service."}
{"text":"Holy crap SLOW!!! The drive thru took FOREVER on a Wednesday evening!!! When finally arriving at the window the staff was unpleasant, unapologetic about the fact that their service took forever and to make it worse I get to the window to pay and they tell me the food I ordered they ran out of (Honey walnut shrimp) to say I was angry would be a complete understatement. I asked for a refund and made the statement the most unfortunate thing is I couldn't get the time back that i sat in their stupid drive through. Never going to back to this location. Horrible horrible horrible"}
{"text":"All the staff are super nice!!!! Maybe because a lot of them are filipinos. I will definitely tell my friends who are visiting vegas and who want to grab a quick rice meal to come to this location! :)"}
{"text":"Open my box pretty much mostly zucchini and mushrooms.. where's the chicken?  I paid 20 and got rabbit food"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Just went in at 8:30 PM when they close at 9:00 pm.  Told they were closed and they would only offer us what was remaining scraps. Then the manager said they close at 8pm. I guess yelp has their hours of business wrong and sodas the sign on their door."}
{"text":"Panda Express is so good at this location. The store is clean and the staff has great customer service. There are times when certain sides are not available because they ran out and that's fine for me because I know that our dishes are freshly being made. I like the fact that they preach no MSG into their food too, it provides a sense of knowledge that you know what you're putting into your body. Their portioning are pretty big, each time they scoop something up they pack in the plate's compartment as much as possible. I only go to this location because at the other locations their rice and chow mein were dry and some of their sides tasted gross."}
{"text":"I love coming into restaurants that are generous with their portioning, Panda Express is one of them. However, don't come during closing time because they wont have as much variety of food left out and you'd have to wait 10-15 minutes for sides such as potstickers.   They let you sample as much food as you want but sometimes it seems like they rush you when people are behind you. I don't recommend going through the drive thru, sometimes mine and my fiancè's orders would be switched around. I'd have his two sides and he'd have mine. Also, ordering it in person and seeing how much goes into your plate is much better, they're not rushing your order like they do through the drive thru.  I order the two entrée plate with fried rice, teryaki chicken, and the Beijing beef. Occasionally, I add in potstickers if there are some already made. If I'm dining in then I'd order a drink. For two, two entrée plates, and a drink would cost about $24, if no drink it would go down to about $21/$20 including tax."}
{"text":"No cream cheese in cream cheese Rangoon... smh everything else was good. First time it happened still good place."}
{"text":"Its Panda.  Its not real Chinese food, and the \"Gourmet Chinese\" sign made me giggle.  Stopped by on Saturday early afternoon before a movie, and I wanted something tasty, and cheap.  I tried the honey walnut shrimp, which was very good.  It was a little on the sweet side, which doesn't bother me too much, I like sweet.  The fried brown rice was good, and not too greasy, and the cream cheese wontons were my favorite, as usual.    I'm not a fan of their sweet and sour sauce for the wontons, but its not horrible.  I'd recommend coming here as early as you can, as the food had a much better flavor early in the day than it usually does when I would go in the evenings.  You KNOW that the food is fresh, as they just opened.  I think they skimp on the entrees, which sucks, especially when you're paying an extra $1.25 for the \"premium\" entrees, but...it is what it is.    Not too shabby.  Not my favorite either, but it will certainly do."}
{"text":"I'm a big chinese food guy I love it I could eat it everyday. Obviously you know what your getting with Panda Express so I won't write a review about the food although I do like it for fast chinese. My pet peeve about this place is half the items they offer are always empty. Don't get me wrong the staff for the most part is very friendly and has no problem cooking a new batch for you but why is that not already done before it ask for it? If you advertise yourself as a fast food chinese place I don't want to have to wait 5-10 minutes for you to cook a fresh batch the employees when something is running low should tell the cook hey we're running low on .... And have it ready to go seems like common sense but I guess not.. I do enjoy the food though when it is fresh"}
{"text":"Today was suppose to be a special activity for my niece and I.  I ordered our favorite lunch to share with my niece for her 4th grade lunch.  I was surprised to find the presentation, quality and customer,service app lacking from Panda Express #2758. I ordered a 2 item plate to share with my niece.  I decided to use the drive thru because up on previous visits, going inside was more than a hassle.  Besides, they usually have at least 2-3 people working the drive thru.  Whereas, inside dining is usually slow in service. I placed my order, which was the first indicator of how my planned meal was going to go.  I requested orange chicken and mushroom chicken and had requested half fried rice and half lo me in noodles.  I don't think the server heard me because she repeated the order as 2 items with lo me in.  I clarified my request and asked for a cup of ice water, 2 chop stixs, 2 fortune cookies.  Since it was a,meal with my niece at her school. At the planned luncheon, I opened the plate to discover my meal was so messy, it looked like the food servers didn't even attempted to use the food tray for its intended purpose.  Portions were unusually small, my mushroom chicken had no observerable pieces of chicken o, it.  My mushroom chicken was a lot of mushroom halves and zuchinni slices. My half rice half lo me in noodles look like the food server served all lo me in noodles and tried to correct it by just topping off the order with rice. I was very disappointed, but was not surprised.  Service from Panda Express #2758 has always been sketchy.  I am sure I am not the only one to report concerns.  I just hope changes and retraining will be coming soon"}
{"text":"If you can make it alive pass the parking lot and get inside, this location is pretty much the same as the others.  Same food, same sodas, same dirty tables.  The staff is friendly and kind, but moves slower than turtles.  The food is of average quality at best, just like all other Panda Expresses.    The orange chicken was good, the noodles were chewy.  The soda fizzes and the loo flushes.  Be careful not to lose your leg to it.    Overall a typical Panda!  It won't disappoint you, and it won't impress you either."}
{"text":"I was out and about running errands for work, when I got hungry and decided to get some Panda to stuff myself.  And this location was literally across the street from where I'm at.    Using my assessment tool for rating fast food joints it calculated that this place get TWO stars.  Quite accurate.  The service was so slow!! It took forever to get my food, a good 12 minutes. And another 6 minutes to pay for it. This place was a little dirty! Most of the empty tables were dirty, so I literally had no where to sit.  But I wasn't gonna stand either so I just wiped down a table for myself.. Pitiful workers.  The cashier was nice.   I got a bowl with rice and Kung Pao Chicken.  The rice was dry.. very dry.. even though they just finished making it, it was dry like it was left out for a few days... and the Kung Pao Chicken.. was spicier then hell.. there is nothing in Panda Express ingredients to be able to make it this spicy!! They must have used other none traditional ingredients... or it could be a fluke.  Note I'm use to eating spicy stuff, I drink Tabasco sauce to help cool down ghost peppers splashed with Satan's blood.  But this Kung Pao kicked hard.  And the aftermath in the Loo was hell too.  It would of fried half of you all.  And for that I give them another star.. bumping them up to THREE! Sorry assessment tool, anyone that can make me sweat and not able to taste my food earns a prize.  Overall a typical Panda.  Train your people not to make the food so spicy that one cannot enjoy it."}
{"text":"If you're gunna say you're open until 10:30 you should probably have at least enough chow mien and fried rice to accommodate customers. I just visited this location at 9:30pm and they didn't even have rice. The portions were also significantly smaller. I don't understand why this place can't make more food as there is still currently a line down the street and they are trying to ration out what is left instead of just making more. It's called customer service. Close earlier if you're going to stop catering to customers."}
{"text":"Fast food joint....Great at fast food Chinese. Nuff said?  Consistently good fast food is what Panda Express is all about.  If you have a Chinese craving and need to fill that void fast this is the place to do it.   I like chow mein, fried rice, and orange chicken: the main staples of fast food Chinese.  Glad to have one in Surprise as a selection for a quick lunch or dinner spot."}
{"text":"By far the worst Panda I've gone to. It's close to home so I keep giving them a chance but I literally want to slap myself for going back each and every time. I speak for the drive thru since I hardly go inside. They are queens on getting orders wrong and never NEVER add the teriyaki sauce. Not in the side or on the chicken. Very frustrating!"}
{"text":"In recognizing previous reviews called it a 'fail', I was supremely dreading coming here.  My American colleague was up in our office this week and he was delighted to see this familiar restaurant nearby his other favourite place (Panera bread).  He definitely wanted to go there for lunch.  So I sacrificed my stomach and drove him here to grab lunch.  Calling it 'lunch' would require it to be edible and sadly, this place is going through some serious growing pains and challenge to cook food.  We didn't have the issue of food availability like others.  What I experienced was a very sparse dish that is more complete of cheap noodle fillers and very cloying sauce.  Considering this is slightly more expensive than cheap Canadian Chinese take out food, it's VERY disappointing.    I would say that Teriyaki is better than this place and I think I gave that a 2 star rating.  The only reason why I don't want to give it a 1 star is that the cashier person was actually doing a good job.  She smiled, offered suggestions helpfully, was constantly cleaning, and attending to patron's needs.    Now if only they could get their food to be the same level."}
{"text":"The food is too much average. I had kang pao chicken n noodles, chicken was not cooked properly n there was hardly any sauce mix which is best part of kang pao chicken. The place looks ugly, I better suggest to move around little bit n try other Panda Express which is close to planet hollywood."}
{"text":"This place can't get it together. Every time we come here it's the longest wait, unfriendly staff and they are always out of the best things. Management needs to get it together. The only reason we come here is because it's next to the gym and we actually like the food. UPDATE CHANGING from 1 star to 3 because we went in last night and had great friendly service. We were the only ones in there at the moment so next time when we go back, if the experience was this good or better I may change my rating accordingly. No complaints today!"}
{"text":"Seemed like the portions are smaller than other Panda Express' I've been too."}
{"text":"George and Son's and Flo's are now my favorite North Scottsdale Chinese eatery's. However, in a rush, Panda gets the job done and at a fair price. Not a place I would ever take guests though. *FYI - George & Son's also delivers!!!"}
{"text":"The foods not bad here but you always have to wait. I think they're a little over priced. I can go to one of the local Chinese carry out places & spend about half the amount of money for the same amount of food. Employees not that friendly either."}
{"text":"Watched a guy on drugs eat rice off the floor. Management did nothing while this guy made lunch very uncomfortable. I tried to talk with him but, he was too far gone."}
{"text":"Slow customer service, needs to take orders of other customers who are in a hurry. Let other customers give time who can't decide what they will order.  Mexican employee very slow. 6/30/17 @10:16am  Need another employee to help her out."}
{"text":"Believe the reviews. Think I'm finally done with this place. I usually just get brown rice & teriyaki chicken, so I'm typically spared by the fact that they're always out of everything. I always attributed it to the fact that they get a heavy lunch rush, and just don't handle it well.  Today, i got there at 11:30 after working a very early morning, expecting piping hot pans of (relatively) fresh-looking food. To my amazement, it was the worst i've ever seen it here; every pan had barely 2 or 3 scoops of food, and it was all picked over with barely any meat in anything, with sauce burnt to the bottom of the pan. It immediately became apparent that they had just reheated last night's leftovers, and hadn't finished making new food for the day.  Absolutely appalling. Not that I should have high hope for a freaking Panda Express... but good grief guys."}
{"text":"At first, I didn't think this Panda Express (in PH's Miracle Mile Shops) even warranted a review, but I am still so dissatisfied that I need to write this.  I went to Vegas this past weekend, and I know what you're thinking, \"Why would you waste precious stomach real estate on something like Panda Express when there are tons of delicious buffets around?!\" The answer is, \" I DONT KNOW T___T\" Actually it was because my friends and I had to grab something quick and leave before traffic got too bad (which it did anyway).  First, the prices are already a little higher than they are in LA. For what I paid, I could have gotten a sandwich from Earl's and it would have actually made me happy.   Second, their food sucks. I actually do like Panda from time to time, but their chow mein was bland, kung pao chicken bland and not even spicy, fried rice tasted like nothing!! (I rather eat dirt!), and the orange chicken was ok. Seriously, I love eating, but this meal brought me no joy and no marginal utility (I'm an econ major).   Third, the workers are so monotonous and mediocre. No smiles. Just pack in your food, ask for your money, and send you on your way. Vegas is not the place to waste time and money on Panda Express.  I have heard that it's an insult to ask for soy sauce because it implies that the cooking/seasoning is not up to your standard. I put in some soy sauce, and at least it tasted like something (just salty, but still). UGH I don't think I've been so dissatisfied by a meal in so long."}
{"text":"I've been to this location before and I've never had problems until today. I actually never noticed they had a drive thru. I go in and an employee is very upset apparently he has been working an hour over his regular shift and is complaining about it. Manager sends him home and she takes over. This is were it gets crazy. I have five orders to place and they run out of the broccoli and beef also the mushroom chicken. Staff is going crazy because they are short on food and their drive thru window is packed. We had to wait maybe 18 extra minutes which I didn't care. Also their soda machine was down. We head home and the fried rice and brown rice was undercooked. In my opinion they need to get rid of the drive thru and employees need better communication skills."}
{"text":"6/3/2018 still no answer from panda about who reached out to me. I called panda they said it's too late for me to ask for help. Unprofessional this particular  store/branch is really bad. I won't go here again."}
{"text":"This Panda Express has a drive-thru, which is great when it's 103 outside and I want lunch without stepping out into the broiler.   It was a fast queue and they got my order right.     The orange chicken/Beijing beef was pretty unpalatable though, it was really dried out and sauceless.  It's a Panda Express, that happens.  Basically your average Panda without getting out of the car."}
{"text":"For a fast food Chinese place, this location does an awesome job. The dining room is always clean, the staff is efficient and friendly and the food is good. My favorites are the mandarin chicken, orange chicken and chow mein."}
{"text":"Decent, quick and typical Panda Express service. Very convenient that this spot is open from 6am-10:30pm. Who wouldn't want orange chicken for breakfast? Lol."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this PE for the past 10 weeks, since I've been doing my training next door for work. It's convenient, close, and isn't extremely inexpensive compared to what's in the area. I've wanted to wait to see if it gets any better, but it hasn't.   Don't get me wrong, the place is clean, and the staff is courteous, just not the best and brightest. On more than one occasion, even as I am repeating my order, the same older, Asian lady messes up my order. I'll order Sweet Fire Chicken, and she still gives me Orange Chicken. Then *I* feel bad for her mistake, because I feel it may be a language barrier issue or something like that, so I don't correct her and just eat what I don't order.   Many times I've gone in there and the food looks old, wilted, and tough. The rice is usually hard, and so are the chow mein noodles. It's just not the best quality for Panda's standards."}
{"text":"It's just like every other Panda Express.  The service was pretty fast.  I used the drive -thru.  I normally DO NOT use the drive-thru for a place like this...I just like to see them place my food in the carry-out tray and HOPEFULLY they don't place the food \"neatly\" or \"the corporate way\" (which they did of course) ughhhh.  Anyway, I needed coupons badly.  They rarely have coupons unless it's the survey coupons on the back of the receipt.  I usually take the survey so I can get an item for free... :)"}
{"text":"Since I found Great Wall (35th and Camelback) and Little Saigon (58th and Glendale) I don't like Panda Express. Plus my favorite SweetFire Chicken Breast is nothing but fried dough and not much chicken in it. If you want to spent $7~9 I'd rather want to eat dim sum at Great Wall or Pho noodle at Little Saigon, it worth to drive there."}
{"text":"The 3 closest Pandas to my house have been very inconsistent, so we decided to give this location a try. It wasn't any better. The workers here do not listen. The guy in front of us was ordering in Spanish. The lady scooped in half chow mein, half fried rice. I guess that wasn't right because she scooped the fried rice back into the pan. That was still wrong because she then dumped the chow mein back into the pan and gave him all fried rice. Weird. So then I ordered. Asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken. She scoops the fried rice onto the plate and then takes my boyfriend's order. Then she asks me what entree. Honey sesame chicken! Ugh. My boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything. Then I get up to the register. I ask for 2 small drinks. The cashier asks me what size. Small! She rings me up and hands me one cup. I asked for two! So we then had to pay for the second drink... We go to fill up our drinks and there is spillage all over the drink station. Sat down to eat. The honey sesame chicken was cold. The orange chicken was barely warm. The teriyaki chicken? It was great! Delicious meat, yummy sauce. That was the winner. The fried rice was also good. At times it has been undercooked/crunchy, but they did a good job today. The Panda Passion tea is very good too. Went to get refills before we left and they had made a pathetic attempt to wipe the spill but it still wasn't clean. All in all, no reason to go out of our way to eat at this location because it's just as inconsistent as the others."}
{"text":"Ate at this Panda for the first time. It was pretty busy. The group of people in front of us were asking to sample everything! Including the rice and chow mein. I've never seen that before. I guess they wanted to know if it was fresh enough for their liking. It wasn't because I heard the guy ask for fresh rice and orange chicken. In the meantime they were all just standing in the line like they were the only people in existence, oblivious to us or anyone else around. Stupid. I got a Panda Bowl with fried rice and teriyaki chicken. The girl put a lot of sauce on top, which I was totally okay with. My food tasted good. The Panda Passion tea was a little on the strong side towards the end."}
{"text":"The egg is back! I had been avoiding Panda for the past year because they were substituting corn in the fried rice due to the egg shortage, but the rice is finally back to normal! Totally made my day. I got a Panda Bowl with fried rice and orange chicken. They really piled on the chicken too. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"There was a short line when I arrived so I knew it was going to take awhile because Panda is always slow. Once I made it up to the counter, I got fried rice, sweet fire chicken, and Beijing beef to go. It was all pretty tasty and the Panda Passion tea is always good too."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for the past two years. Customer service used to be great but has been going down hill over the past six to nine months. The most recent visit the food was over cooked and was clearly sitting there for a while. I had to wait for Rosa to ring me up. She was called at least 3 times. She was slouch sitting in the dinning lobby on her phone. A man from the kitchen called her once more and she decided to finally get up. As I'm paying I ask for some soy sauce and chili and I'm given one of each. I had purchased two plates to go. No fortune cookies. Over all bad experience. I will either drive to a further location or get Wok box for future take out."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for a Panda Bowl with fried rice & teriyaki chicken and a Panda Passion tea. It was yummy!"}
{"text":"This Panda is usually busy so the food tends to be relatively fresh, in my experience. I got fried rice, orange chicken, and teriyaki chicken. The lady at the register seemed to have a good system down: Drink? Want to donate your change? Need soy sauce? etc. I appreciated that. I was disappointed that the Panda Passion tea was empty, but there was Blackberry Jasmine green tea so I tried that and liked it. My food was decent. Not the best I've had, but could be worse. I just wish they would just get rid of the stupid corn until they can get eggs for the fried rice again..."}
{"text":"I had not eaten at this particular Panda until now. The guy behind the counter confused me a little bit because he looked at me like he was ready to take my order, but then started talking to another person behind the counter. Then I started to say what I wanted, but I still didn't have his full attention. Hmph! Had to start giving my order about 3 times before he was ready to listen. The chow mein looked a little sad but I was getting fried rice so it was okay. The mixed veggies were also sad-looking but the guy was nice enough to ask my boyfriend if he wanted fresh vegetables (he did). A lot of the food actually looked fresh... particularly the honey sesame chicken and sweet fire chicken. But I was getting the teriyaki chicken which is pretty much always fresh. They packed my Panda Bowl with fried rice and teriyaki chicken! Impressive. I noticed the sign saying their ice maker was broken so we made the decision to take our food to go so we could split a large Panda Passion tea and put our own ice cubes in it. My Panda Bowl was still hot when we got home. And it was good! The rice was cooked well and the chicken tasted fresh & delicious. Best Panda we've had in awhile. Maybe next time they will have ice and we can dine in. :)"}
{"text":"Had a good lunch at Panda yesterday. Most of the food looked pretty fresh and there was a wait on the teriyaki chicken, as there usually is. It's good stuff and they can't keep up with the demand! But for this visit I went with the Beijing Beef in a Panda Bowl with half fried rice, half chow mein. It was tasty. There was only one piece of meat that was tough to chew. But that bowl filled me up! Enjoyed the Panda Passion Tea as well. 3.5 rounds to 4."}
{"text":"My chicken walnut was great but my chow main and orange chicken didn't taste so great. I let the manager know and he started me up a new batch I didn't mind waiting 5 minutes for fresh food and I understand things happen."}
{"text":"I used to hate going to this location because the chicken was horrible. but now they have a cook thats putting hard work in and making the food amazing! keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but nothing is ever ready. I don't think they should call it Panda Express when you have to wait 15 minutes after ordering to get your order. I could have gone to a full serve restaurant and got my food faster."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this particular location and I have to say all in all very satisfied. Service was good. Food was very fresh and very tasteful. There was some trash on the floor between the bathroom and condiment station and by the front door but all in all pretty clean place. I would recommend to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Food and service are great, freshly cooked when we come in, not sure if that is a coincidence or not but it's every time."}
{"text":"It's kind of a bummer when a staff member is standing in the middle of the dining room screaming at someone on her cell phone. Especially when every table in the dining room was dirty. Hope she got her problem solved, but wish she would've taken her call elsewhere. Also food didn't seem very fresh, even though it was mid-lunch. Not my favorite Panda."}
{"text":"I use to go to this location regularly. The last few time has got worse each visit. The fried rice was flavorless  and stuck together, the chow mein was cold, and my green bean chicken breast was 90% old mushy green beans. I do not recommend this location. There are plenty others near by"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They should treat the last customer like the first and they don't. Pathetic"}
{"text":"One of the most disgusting meals I have seen lately. I was skeptical to come here in the first place, and I I wish that my perception was what ruined the experience for me.  My MIL loves the orange chicken from here and since she was visiting, we stopped by to get her an order. And decided to get a combo platter to test some things out.  MIL enjoyed the orange chicken. She did not enjoy her fried rice- which she said she usually does.. so these issues may be just the location?  Basically the fried rice and the lo mein sides were inedible. Like as in, are those styrofoam noodles or real? I mean, I never meant a noodle or fried rice I couldn't eat but this was the moment!! Disgusting. The entrees we tried were super meh. The fried general tso's was 'fine' because it's fried meat covered in sweet sauce. Sooo hard to get wrong. Same thing with the orange chicken.  Beef with broccoli was just broccoli. I was seriously just curious what the beef even looked like. Good chunks of broccoli though, if you are into it!  Overall, I thought this might be a nice hangover spot (drive-thru clutch) and random pregnancy cravings. Um, no. Save yourself the horror and make your own fried rice (so easy and not disgusting!)."}
{"text":"1st time Panda Express experience...I thought the food was good.  Simple, good, inexpensive...the food was far better than I anticipated for a chain.  I'll go back.  My sons love going there - I can see why.  BBQ pork, chow mein, Chicken w/ string beans - all very tasty."}
{"text":"Was really cravings Chinese food. So I stopped in on my lunch brake. I ordered a combo meal with two Meats.   The teriyaki chicken which was delicious and a very generous portion. The 2nd meat i ordered was the black pepper chicken which is my all-time favorite.   However I was really disappointed there was tons and tons of vegetables but barely any of the peppered chicken.   I also asked for half rice and half chow mein. I guess the food a server didn't hear me because she loaded up my play with only rice. I also got a side order of the cream cheese puffs, absolutelyabsolutely delicious. Wish they had the option of crab would make it even better."}
{"text":"We ordered two, 2 entree take out dinners and one Panda Bowl. On one of the meals we were charged an extra dollar for crispy shrimp which was never delivered. The chicken appeared to be mostly pieces of chicken skin and breading and the Mongolian beef was tough and stringy. Most of the meals were overwhelmed with a very dry rice concoction that was supposed to be fried rice. We also never received any soy sauce so we could at least moisten the rice into an edible state. These were very disappointing meals that cost a total of $18.82 that did not include a beverage. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. I would recommend against patronizing the particular Panda Express. Because of our experience here, I probably will not patronize any more Panda Expresses... and let me tell you folks... I am not a very picky guy... but this. place was really a disappointment"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after a recent volleyball game. It was 8pm, which is late for us to eat dinner. We didn't want to start cooking at that time, so to Panda Express we went.  Upon arrival, there was a short line due to the staff working slowly. There were six employees present, three of them were eating in the dining room, one was handling the drive through, one was cooking, and one was taking dine in orders. Within a few minutes, we were selecting our entrees to go.  I ordered Kung Pao chicken over chow mein noodles bowl. My son ordered orange chicken over white rice bowl. My daughter ordered a orange chicken and peanut chicken with fried rice plate. My wife ordered a teriyaki chicken over white rice bowl. We paid $25 and the orders were made and taken to go. This was a very good price to feed four of us, especially when we're used to paying a minimum of $35 for a meal for four.  All the way home, the food smelled great in the car! We barely got into the kitchen before we attacked the Chinese goodness. My son took a bite and then ran to the trash to spit it out. He is very sensitive to spicy food. His orange chicken was spicy. I tasted it and it did have a bit of a kick, surprisingly. I then tasted my wife's teriyaki chicken, which had no spice at all. I asked if she could switch with my son, so he could eat something. They switched and he hesitated to eat the teriyaki chicken, but within a few minutes, he made the new dish disappear. My wife said in disappointment, \"...but I wanted teriyaki chicken!\"  My Kung Pao chicken had a nice kick to it. I didn't like the whole chili peppers in the dish because they're hard to chew. However, they looked nice and I simply tossed them out. The chow mein noodles were also tasty and paired well with the Kung Pao. The bowl was a nice portion. Of course, I could eat more, but I'm trying to reduce my overall mass.  I tasted the teriyaki chicken, the orange chicken, and the peanut chicken too. All the food was tasty, if not spicy, save for the teriyaki chicken. The price was right and they have a drive through.   We would eat here again. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Panda Express is a consistent, fast food Chinese option. I always go for the steamed vegetables in place of lo mein or rice. The orange chicken is good when it's fresh and they just introduced these new short ribs... they are delicious! ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"I has been years since I last had Panda Express and it'll be many more years before I eat it again. When I came here to break my Panda Express fast yesterday, I knew it was a bad sign that none of the woks were in use. Everything on display had clearly been out for at least an hour. The chow mein was totally desiccated and I really should've given up and looked into better options. My food was cold after the 20 minute trip back home and I had serious concerns about getting sick from the room temp and old Kung pao chicken. The reason this place doesn't receive only 1 Star is that the workers were super nice and friendly. I also believe that the lack of turnover for the food reflects the slow business in this area, so I can't blame them directly for having food sit out for so long."}
{"text":"Love this location. The food always seems so much more fresh here. Other locations sometimes you end up with the end of a batch that's been sitting out but the food here is so consistent. Service is fast and friendly and the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean. As a mall employee I end up popping in often. They also have a few tables outside which is nice when the weathers not too hot."}
{"text":"I live in CA and was visiting my sister in Mesa, AZ. She had not been to a PE before. I have been enjoying their food for at least a couple of years. We were both very satisfied with the quality and quantity of food. We got 2 take-out orders and had 2 meals at her home at her home. She said she'll be going back the next time she wants Chinese food. I've visited several PEs over the past years and have found very little difference in them. The food is the same and the restaurants are always clean. No complaints with the staff, but there's need for very little interaction with them. I do wish they'd make the fried rice and chow mien more flavorful."}
{"text":"Got here at 8:50 and when I walked in the girl told me that they close at 9:30 and that they've been \"slow\" so they don't have many sides. There was chow mein and 4 side dishes out. I asked for fried rice and she told me that they couldn't make it that late even though there was still 40 min til close... I then asked how long the 4 sides had been sitting out and she said 20 min which was hard to believe because they all looked super old. I seemed to be hassling them by being there so \"late\" so I turned around and walked out."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I live two blocks away so i have eaten at this location more than once. Every single time i go they mess up my order. My count is 8 times thus far. They never pay attention. We had to wait for bejing beef twice while they let our food sit and filled drive thru ordes even though we were here first. I have spoken with the manager. He should not be mannager. When i came back to get my correct order he offered me two free sodas.  Even though i told him we did not drink soda. Deffinately calling corporate on this location. Needs a new staff and new trainer up in there."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill. Elida is horrible and if get her ask for another associate. She made it seem like asking for something was a problem. She has no customer service skills at all. The manager offered me two complimentary kids meals for my kids and on the day I came to obtain, I was told I could only use one, which he did not inform me about when ge gave them to me. Very horrible service. Wish the other manager Bryan was back!"}
{"text":"Fried rice was ok, broccoli beef was pretty decent..only issue was the orange chicken..tasted like it had been sitting for a while..overall, pretty efficient service..everyone looks like they're moving at a faster than normal pace which is always a good thing. I wouldn't make this my first choice (a lot of other places to pick from near by) but I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it.."}
{"text":"This is the panda express I go to since it's near at the gym. Love the food, staff is friendly enough. They need to add more walnuts to the honey walnut shrimp though, saw the chef add barely any to a full fresh batch, and when it was served to me, I barely got any walnuts with my shrimp. ;-;  Just watch out on how much you eat, the food is good, but high in calories!"}
{"text":"I'm done with Panda Express, they never seem to have brown rice anymore. Also an hour after they open they still don't have all the options. This place told me they only make brown rice in the mornings. I'm done sticking with Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"This should be NO STAR! First, read everyone's comments and notice all the (1star) there's a reason! I'm so sad I didn't listen! This is my second visit I thought they might improve! On my first visit, I ordered Shanghai beef & orange chicken. The orange chicken was extra extra spice hot!! Burned my mouth and I told the manager young Chinese guy and he said it's suppose to be spicy!! and point to the sign (which had a chili pepper). Okay....I thought, but I'm telling you it's extra extra spicy!! THE COSTUMERS ALWAYS RIGHT DUDE! I know this, because this is my favorite item, and today at this location it's extra extra spicy!!  He didn't offer to change my choice or re-make it! My entire party didn't eat the orange chicken and it was a waste of money! The orange chicken is our favorite item and we didn't eat it! Says a lot!!!  The second visit was today, :( I went because we had a coupon. I ordered the same entree Shanghai beef and orange chicken. This time orange chicken was HOW IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE! The Shanghai beef was cold and tasted like it's been sitting there since noon! It's 2:00pm my free item was 8 treasure chicken. DO NOT GET THIS ITEM, it has an overkill of peppercorns. Yeah! my daughter choked on her first bite!! Not during the process of eating or chewing and swallowing, but the attempt of putting in mouth.  The slight inhale one takes upon biting, That part, the extreme fumes from an overload of peppercorns, caught her off guard and my daughter immediately started coughing. It all happen quickly and this first bite was enough to have her choke from the peppercorn fumes. It took her awhile too speak and catch her breath. The meal was over for all of us!   A gal named Kendra answered and I told her about my experience and near death encounter from peppercorns. Her response was we can't do anything about how you eat and added that's why we offer you taste samples and each item has a recipe we follow. Oh really? Then how do you explain the range of spicy from our last visit and this visit? I know and you know each cook is different! I'm telling you this dish has an overkill of peppers and my last visit my favorite item had way too much spice!!! She didn't say sorry or ask if my daughter was ok. She didn't offer to re-make or have my money refunded. Then she stated she was not the manager and there is no manager on duty today?!?   On top all this, the use of coupons is not worth it! The elder Chinese lady didn't seem to honor coupons. She said I already have a free item and was hesitated to offer me the free drink coupons I gave her. I had to read to her the fine print \"no purchase necessary!\"   No life is worth this."}
{"text":"So, I love Panda Express. Usually. However, this is the slowest location I have ever been to. Twice now it has moved at beyond a snails pace. Today, I was skipped in line and had to wait more since the cook staff fails to make enough food to keep the line stocked. And the kicker? It wasn't even busy. I count 4 tables occupied. I'm never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Always clean and courteous. Portions are plentiful. Price is right. Food is good. They stick to the basics instead of trying to please everyone with a million selections.  The only downside is they never seem to have much of the mixed vegetable side available. I understand it wouldn't be fresh if they made too much ahead of time. Maybe my timing is always off. Maybe next time it will be my time. Lol"}
{"text":"This location has no sense of urgency. It's not like Panda Express is some miraculous place where food is cooked all day long, freshly prepared. It shouldn't take longer than 5min to receive your food and it ALWAYS does.. There's a post showing a screen shot over 8minutes. It's usually about that wait time. Way too overpriced so it makes me question the lack of Chinese joints available here in AZ"}
{"text":"Standard Panda Express facilities.   I don't expect much from fast food, but decided to share my negative experience with this specific location to save others from frustration.  Zero customers in line, I waited 5-8 minutes to be helped. Half of the selection items out; understandable if busy, but had literally 5 customers eating. No manners from staff.   Again, I don't expect much from fast food, but still frustrating. There are plenty of other options in the area. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes in drive-through the 1st trip.   On the 2nd trip we got to the window I was told to go through the drive-through again. By the time we went through again they forgot about the order and made it on the spot.  Worst Service Ever"}
{"text":"Monday night was pretty packed here which surprised me because it was a weekday. This Panda Express was short staffed but an employee by the name of Aleks made up for it. Though there was a little wait and some other customers didn't have patience, Aleks kept a smile on his face and good attitude. When he charged me for the food he apologized for the wait and gave me 10% discount for waiting. I expected to wait after I saw how busy it was so I was unbothered but Aleks kept all his customers in mind and moved with a sense of urgency and had a lot more patience than the customers though he was doing most of the work. I only can picture how hard it would be for me to be in his shoes. Thank you so much Aleks!"}
{"text":"Craving Chinese, so we went back to this location today. Chow Mein bowl is threads away from being empty, but do you think they were making any? NO. Same thing happened the last time I was here. I think they may need to install some type of monitor to let the cooks know when the Chow Mein is almost gone. The young lady serving the food was very nice, but she was literally doing everything while the 2 cooks  just stared at the food cooking...and by food, I don't mean Chow Mein. When we first got there we were the only ones in line. By the time we left there was a line 7 deep...know what they were waiting for? CHOW MEIN. To the owners/managers of this particular franchise. You really should read what people are writing. The food tastes good, but honestly I will drive a little further to get better service, or at least Chow Mein that is made with some forethought."}
{"text":"I like this panda express vs the other location for the simple reason the staff actually talks to you and are not all uptight when you ask for a sample  I ate the pacific shrimp.it was amazing .the portion was good .my kids had Angus steak to go and they loved it.very tender ."}
{"text":"Ordered the two entree plate with orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. Got home to find they had only given me the orange chicken."}
{"text":"Everything was cold this Panda Express is awful will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is good and maybe the best one that I have been to however they do not fill up the entree plates and the rice and noodles were cold."}
{"text":"They have Great customer service. Every time I walk in the door they greet me. And every time u leave they always say thank u. It's all such great people."}
{"text":"This was awful today , brown rice was so dry , as was Beijing beef. Really bad ! I should have known . I was sick an hour later . We will not be back to this one !"}
{"text":"They were not particularly busy at dinner time, but there was no fried rice ready (a batch didn't turn out eight and was tossed), my Beijing Beef was mushy, and they never have salt and pepper out. When the food is fresh-cooked it's pretty good but for some reason that's hit or miss at this store."}
{"text":"I wish you could give a score below 1 star & still be able to review.. But anyways.. THIS LOCATION FCKING SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!! Absolute horrible customer service & I seriously live in the area and it's very convenient and it's always the same workers and I get the same order each time and they ALWAYSSSSS mess it up! I'm starting to feel it's on purpose. It's this lil Mexican dude who thinks he can fight his customers. Don't know why they hire such horrible customer service. DONT GOOOOOOOO TO THIS NASTY LOCATION!!!!"}
{"text":"I've came here a few times and have been helped by a girl named Maria with glasses, Hispanic, she gave me attitude both times  I came I wanted a sample and she refused to give me one I let it go and couldn't decide and she was rolling her eyes. Don't think  I'll be back"}
{"text":"When you want a healthy serving of freshly made food this is the place to visit. They do not skimp like some other places and the employees are always smiling and courteous. The speed of service was less than 3 minutes as well! We drive out of our way to spend our money here. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"After many failed attempts, I must show a picture of the typical portion/servings for this restaurant in particular. Unfortunately for Panda Express on Riggs, their sister store on Pecos and McQueen puts them to SHAME! If you want your money's worth- Do Not Go to the Riggs store. Go to the Pecos store instead for a real portion size and consistency every time."}
{"text":"Well just average. Chow mein was dry very very dry I'd say stick to the rice. Tried a beef option and of course the orange chicken because well it's panda express. Both were dry, not as dry as the chow mein but was just expecting better. Nothing I'm running back for or probably will ever go back to. I'll take my 15 dollars to the mom and pop Chinese place."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me - and that's you, buddy - know I (used to) love Panda Express. Enough to keep menus up at my desk at work to advertise. Note: they are coming down tomorrow. Yeah, I've been lazy up to this point, but now that this is in print, I gotta keep up with my obligations.  I just can't take it anymore. The prices increase with...every...single...visit. As does the wait in the drive thru. My first experience with both the price gouging and the 8 minute wait through the drive thru (God, I'd pray for 8 minutes now) I thought: \"Well, the food is still great and this might be a one-time occurrence.\"  But, just in case, on the next visit, I timed the experience - clocked at 12 minutes - and I almost asked for a discount, you know, to bring back the price to the previous visit. My reasoning for the markdown? Duh, gas prices have increased.  I'm not dumb or ignorant enough not to know the two are intertwined, but like a lot of other Americans, I will be finding another place to spend my money for a better value. Panda has done NOTHING to convince me to return. Well, aside from the cuddly bears in their marketing. Okay, okay, I kinda like those talking pandas, but it's not working.  Still, I rate Panda Express 2/5 stars because I still love their food. I can't find Beijing Beef anywhere else and that's my favorite. Also, their \"Chow Mein\" - by the way, guys, that's more like LO MEIN, but still - is good as is their Orange Chicken (though I've had much better at a Chinese Buffet.) Unfortunately, you'll have to pay an extra dollar for shrimp items, and take my word for it: it's not worth it. I'd barely order them at the same price.  Lesson? Don't choose the Drive Thru, save up for your yearly visit there - as I will, but can a restaurant stay open if that's the case? - and prepare for a long wait if you don't go inside. It's about the same amount of time as if you went to a standard sit-down establishment, such as Applebee's...for about the same price."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  It's fast asian food so what can I really say that you don't already know?  Their new dining room is very nice, comfortable, and clean.  They have outdoor patio seating, which is cool.  Decent options as far as entrees go and I've never had any surprises in my chicken lol.  I think it can be a little expensive for what it is and the fried rice is a bit bland.  But when I'm looking for something quick but different than the typical burger, this place is a strong option."}
{"text":"Now, don't judge me, I'm not writing on the quality of food, but on the overall experience.  My other half absolutely loves Panda. So, when we heard there was a new Panda coming into town (as they're in literally every other city, but CLE), he leapt for joy.  I've had Panda in multiple other states- and it's your typical fast food fake Chinese food. This Panda surprised me though- very modern, ample parking, clean, and fast service.  I'm not sure why the other reviewers hate on this location so much. Sure, the service is a little confused at times- but what do you expect- having worked in retail food settings before, if you have a million of people coming at you wanting their deep fried fake Chinese food, being all hangry, of course it would be hard to get the orders straight!   The classics at Panda were good- the Beijing beef was deep fried nicely, as well as the orange chicken. The Kung Pao had a nice bite to it, and the other sides (chow mein, fried rice) were what you would expect. Ordered the honey walnut shrimp once- wasn't a fan of that, as I had expected the mayo shrimp like texture- it was just deep fried batter surrounding shrimp. Overall though, I liked how the food wasn't sitting in a bed of oil though. Also, they are really generous with their portions- if you order a plate, you probably could make it into two meals.   It's super clean and modern inside and for what it is, I give Panda a pretty high rating. It's what you expect for an Americanized Chinese food place."}
{"text":"Unfriendly peoples, food was cold and hard. Feb 28, 2016 @ noon. Gross food."}
{"text":"This is only my 2nd time here. However for the convenience of it being late night and the low price it's not to bad. After a 12 he work day and 5 hours waiting in the ER, it's a quick go to that I may need to remember for the future."}
{"text":"Hunter was extremely helpful and kind throughout the entire process. She warmly greeted me as I entered the store, and was thorough and efficient while providing service. I will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I have never been to a panda with such slow service.  The lady behind the register was very frazzled. They should have someone behind counter who don't get easily frustrated when its busy.  And hire more people for the busy dinner rush. They also need to teach the people to communicate better with each other."}
{"text":"Good Tasty and Fresh. Check out the Sugar Wontons. Mm Those are addicting."}
{"text":"Same Quality that most other panda express' have. Line moves quickly and always get free samples if you want to try something new. Parking lot is a little crowded depending on what time you go. But thats everywhere."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, not the most attentive place. Food is what you would expect, come in outside the peak business hours and its not so tasty."}
{"text":"Little disappointed in this panda. Came in with a coupon buy a 2 plate entree and get an entree free. Ok well we bought 2 2plate entrees and should get an entree free. Ok so they charged us for a 3 plate, 2 plate and then the entree and then subtracted the coupon. So that's like an extra 2.75. Told the lady she was wrong and she tried to say it would be the same price. She was wrong, the manager gave us a $1 back. They spoke Spanish while doing the refund. Wonder what they were saying."}
{"text":"$7 for a small rice bowl with tons of rice and no meat. Bad attitude of girl handling cash and food like it's inconvenient for her to take my order."}
{"text":"I moved recently and am not near my favorite Panda Express anymore that was in Ahwatukee. So when I had the opportunity to eat at this one I was glad........     Food was OK, the usual consistent food that you expect.   BUT on the way out I used the restroom and if I had used it before I ordered, I would have just walked out......    They need to check them more often and just don't put a Wet Floor sign up, actually do something to keep it clean. There were two employee's on break when I came in, so they just need to change their priorities and Clean the restroom BEFORE they take their break!"}
{"text":"Angela, hopefully that's correct, (the one with glasses and ponytail) is always nice and joyful when taking my order. It's my second time getting an order from her and she's still extremely sweet and fast about the order. She always have a smile on her face and very smart about her job too. There was another girl taking my order as well, but she was quite slow. But I believe the other one was a new worker because other workers were quick on their feet. Luckily, Angela came out of nowhere and quickly finished my order with that amazing aura of hers."}
{"text":"I've been in the drive-through for 27 minutes and I can't move as I'm stuck between cars. I don't know what's taking so long but when I get to order there is a sign that says the soda machine is down and then they tell me to hold for another three minutes this is very upsetting and it took my entire lunch break"}
{"text":"Now that Gerardo is gone (see my previous review), this place has employees that really would rather you just not be there. The old lady at the cash register is beyond unfriendly!! We feel so uncomfortable and awkward dining here, feeling very unwelcome, that we no longer eat here anymore. We go to a different location if we want Panda."}
{"text":"I just ran out of there I was waiting to order and a roach came from behind the TV to your right and across the wall were some people eating I got sick to my stomach and left . Management needs to resolve this problem"}
{"text":"Just had lunch from Panda Express. After all the people on my FB timeline who raved about how good the food was, my first visit was extremely disappointing. Fried rice... flavorless and dry. Lo mein noodles... flavorless and dry. Beijing beef was heavily breaded and fried to a crispy death, the beef was hard to discern in each bite because of all the breading. The veggie spring rolls were very greasy and the sauce for said rolls was cloyingly sweet. The only good note I have is that the service was fast and friendly, however I would prefer a longer wait accompanied by a quality dining experience."}
{"text":"When I go to a restaurant during prime time I expect results. I did not get them at Panda express at the mall. After completing my order they legitimately offered me something that was unavailable. When I accepted their offer of a crab rangoon they said \"actually we don't have any you'll have to wait for us to cook more.\" No I don't I retorted, taken aback by the circumstances prolonging my insatiable hunger. Next time tie me up and gag me before you try to screw me Panda Express, your games do not entertain me."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time in last 30 days that i came and got 5 orders for my family for dinner and I'm very disappointed. Their portions that they put in the to go boxes have been skimped, beef and broccoli there was more broccoli and hardly any beef, fluffing of the chow mein noodles to make it look like there is more, the orange chicken were tiny and tasted like it had been sitting there all day. I tried to give them a chance, twice, hoping maybe there was an off day as I'm not an unreasonable person but I'm definitely not coming back now. None of us could finish our dinner because it was unappetizing and didn't taste fresh or flavorful."}
{"text":"It took over 30 minutes to get through the line... What Panda Express takes that long?! The staff is not only inefficient with serving customers, but also with keeping the restaurant clean.  Imagine what else they do with the food that we just don't see...  And sure enough - I find a small hair in my vegetables! Then when I went to ask to speak to a manager, the guy went to talk to her and came back and said if it's food related, we just have to take your number down... THE MANAGER WOULDN'T EVEN COME TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS!!"}
{"text":"We came to this panda express as our last stop before heading out of Phoenix Arizona. We were craving some Chinese and knew this would satisfy our needs. We always choose the noodles and the rice option with a stack of orange chicken!  Be sure to get a couple of egg rolls on the side.  Unfortunately we did not receive any fortune cookies. Maybe you need to ask for them? We were sad about that and didn't have time before our flight to go back and request :(   Tips and tricks--ask for a free sample. They will give you a yummy treat on the toothpick while you are deciding what's  your favorite. Walnut shrimp is a great choice.  Usually the weather is nice in Phoenix, grab a seat outdoor and enjoy the scenery! If you're not too hungry, order the kids meal. That is the perfect snack size."}
{"text":"Really poor service. 1) they failed to fill my order properly, which sadly was not discovered until I had driven all the way home with my carry out order.  You can see they failed to put in the Kung pao chicken.   2) I had also ordered teriyaki chicken, which they indicated would require. 3-minute wait.  Well, after the three minutes, the chicken was ready but rather than filling the orders of the customers they asked to wait in order, they didn't seem to have any specific plan in mind.  I had to ask twice for my order to be filled. 3) I don't know why, but the food this time was also especially underseasoned.  Overall a real disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is great. Always chill atmosphere. Cute cashiers. Fair prices. The closest Panda Express to me."}
{"text":"Orange Chicken too Spicy! The orange chicken was much spicier than normal.  I'm not sure if this location uses a different recipe than other locations, but it was too spicy for my wife and kids to eat.  I ordered orange chicken because it is typically sweet and delicious, with maybe a little zing, but nothing all that spicy.  We recently had orange chicken from another Panda Express location, and it was mild enough for my wife and kids to eat.  I'm assuming you go to Panda for the orange chicken, so be aware this location serves up the spicy variety."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to home. I normally don't like ordering food from here but when you have that craving or the area  is just limited to type of restaurants for a cheap, fast dinner. Anyway each time I come here it's usually in the early part of the evening (630-730ish), their pans are bare. They do not close till 9 or whatever time and what am I gonna order??? I'm sure they can cook more but they'll make you wait and rush the cooking. Why not have the pans filled, are they conserving? It seems also one time about 8pm, they are cleaning and mopping in the kitchen area. Barely any food in pans. I am not having them prepare me anything because I am not gonna be contaminated with cleaning chemicals. I've decided to eat elsewhere. The chicken teriyaki was also a bit rushed, undercooked and lacked flavor of the marinade. I've been to many panda's and this location needs improvement!"}
{"text":"I thought I would stop and pick up a quick dinner, what started out to be a quick dinner pick up, it ended up being a long dinner pick up.  We always enjoy the food from panda express, our problem lies with the poor staff it seems like they are poorly trained and not up to speed on how to handle customer service.  We ordered three or four entrées and rice and the containers were half full.  You expect spots at the top, but not half-empty, when you're paying nine dollars for a box of food expect them to fill the whole container up at least almost to the top.  The staff overcharged us by $10 and it took ten more minutes to figure it out and get a refund.   You would think a national chain like panda express with the training program for their staff, so less mistakes and better customer service could be provided to the customers.  I would stay away from this panda express if you were in a hurry.  Very slow and poorly trained staff!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed that it took me 25 minutes in traffic to get to the 51st Ave & baseline location after working a 11hr shift and treat myself to my favorite Panda Express 3 entree and mixed rice box to find out the drive thru lady was in training and gave me white steamed rice when I got home 27 minutes later. I immediately called and spoke to the manager Micheal who gave me a lame excuse about Lydia being new and read the order wrong and he would teach her. He never offered for me to come back and have my order corrected, a couple complimentary anything after I spent almost $11 of my hard earned money to pay for this meal I could've made at home cheaper not to mention the gas waisted to get there and back and I cannot even be offered a refund or replacement of rice? That is bad business and I stop here every Friday free my payday yo get my favorite meal over the past 10 months and have never had this issue! I am taking my business somewhere else every Friday and will blog this ordeal as I spend good money with Panda and have used the catering service for my staff of 83 people over the past three years!! This is not the way to treat valuable customers and as a Corporate manager of a nationwide organization I would like to add the management skills Micheal showed lacks proper training within resolution of disputes and complaints!! Tonia"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite to eat and I just love their orange chicken and chow mein! Prices are not bad either especially for what you run into in Vegas! So having a slow day where you wanna eat a lot at a modest price? Come here. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary. Service was quick and efficient. The food quality is consistent making me return again and again."}
{"text":"This Panda Express doesn't even deserve a star. I was treated badly by a manager at that location. They didn't want to replace my order that was messed up. I had to call corporate and still they took 2 weeks to contact me back. I suggest to go to a different Panda Express preferably in the \"hood\" because you'll get treated way better than here. There cheese Rangoon's are always burnt as well as the orange chicken tastes funky."}
{"text":"Glad they have eggplant tofu here. Too bad anytime I order it I have to wait 20 minutes or longer. I understand it gets busy but they need better organization and priorities."}
{"text":"This location isn't what is used to be:( They have always had fresh and hot food but things have really gone downhill! I'm not sure if they changed  management? Food isn't fresh and definitely not hot! I would give zero stars but fried rice is good. If that is all u would like to eat, then this is the place for u!"}
{"text":"We love Panda Express but this location is terrible!! The food is always old or cold, poor customer service, and dirty dining area. If u have a taste for Panda it's worth the drive to Estrella Parkway or Dysart!"}
{"text":"Ok I will keep this short  Saturday night 2items plus fired rice entered my stomach followed by 7 shots of alcohol, all the food was back out from my mouth 2 hours later.  But seriously this location is ok, the food wasn't too hot around 6pm regular dinner time, nothing special compare to other Pandas."}
{"text":"My personal opinion is that Panda Express is one of the best fast food places there is.  As long as you are ordering what is already available - it is the fastest food service there is!  Staff is always attentive and friendly.  If you go around lunch and dinner times food is very fresh and hot!  I always get the 2 entree plate and do a 1/2 and 1/2 of the fried rice and chow mein (they also have white & brown rice and mixed vegetables).  I really like the Beijing Beef, SweetFire Chicken Breast and the Teriyaki Chicken (they give you a full breast and 1/2+).  I enjoy getting the free fortune cookie!  All this for just $8.15 out the door in record time.  P.S. They have some upgraded options that are an extra $1.25 (Honey walnut shrimp and Shanghai Angus steak)."}
{"text":"To give it one star is really generious.  My wife and I was there Saturday Jan 20. Most of the food looked like it was their for hours and picked through.The bathrooms were disgusting and needed to be clean.  There was no toilet paper in the restroom either.  I stopped my wife from purchasing the food there.  We went to another close by restruant to purchase our food."}
{"text":"Can you be addicted to Panda Express? Cause I think I may have a Panda abuse problem...or I've just convinced myself that its good for me cause it's the only way I can make myself eat veggies!"}
{"text":"I stopped In to this place and they didn't have chow mein nor General Tso's chicken, nor broccoli beef at 5:30pm I had to wait 11 minutes for my \"to go order\", I had to repeat my order three times to the high school student taking my order. Service is everything- cheap labor gives birth to bad service and business. No one was over 21 in the store, with food items missing, it shows lack of leadership and pre-planning. I'll need to skip this place for now."}
{"text":"Love getting welcomed in :) The costumer service was great ! They're teamwork made it even better ! I was in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Maybe its this  express, maybe its all of them, but they never seem to get my order right, ive had to repeat myself 7-10 times and they still proceed to mess it up, giving me sides i didnt ask for and not giving me sides i did ask for. I never knew the school cafeteria was now located in a chinese fast food shop, cause i never seem to get what i want, just what they want to give me."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is located at Town Square next to the AMC theater. I mean, Panda Express is Panda Express. I feel like they've gotten a little more expensive than they used to be. We came when it just opened for the day so not all the food was made yet -- had to wait 5-ish minutes for the entree I wanted. Staff is friendly, good customer service but nothing above average.   I think everyone knows how Panda Express works -- an Asian Chipotle lol. I normally get a bowl with fried rice and Kung Pao Chicken (spicy chicken with peanuts and way too many vegetables). Their orange chicken is good but majority of the time is super strong, smell and flavor wise. Their mushroom chicken is good, too, but kinda watery.   I'd really only come to Panda if there's nothing else to eat or if I'm really craving some friend rice and Kung Pao Chicken."}
{"text":"Everything was full and fresh including the veggies. A girl name jessica with glasses made a wonderful impression. Pleasent attitude. She needs a raise like now we both had orange chichen and I had shrimp. Mixed veggies which we usually have to wait for. Pleasent experience"}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty. When we came in there was no line, but the whole store was filthy. The girl helping us wasn't only rude, she had no idea what the \"chef special\" was. I think her exact response was \"ummmm, it was. I don't know, he just made it.\" When we asked if they had more chow mein coming she looked as us like we were speaking Klingon. I'd asked if she could try to get more noodles than veggies in the chow mein for the kids meal, she sighed and S L O W L Y picked through the little bit left. I finally just told her to grab what she could because I wasn't going to wait 10 minutes for her to grab it noodle by noodle. We also had three meals which we intended to get all noodles with, but low and behold, no one had called for it until there wasn't enough for our third meal. We just decided on getting half fried rice. When we were trying to choose our entrees, the woman helping us was too focused on talking to her coworkers to pay attention to what we'd chosen. She had to ask us repeatedly. When I went to fill the kids drink, the drink station was disgusting and sticky. The bottom was open and you could see the employee beverages stuffed under the actual soda dispenser. Overall, extremely unhappy with my experience. Food was lukewarm, tasted just okay, portions were less than I've received normally. Won't be back to this location for any reason."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Century III Area!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience here tonight. Went in for 3 bowls and a entree plate. Lots of food was not ready on the line. Waiting for just about everything you wanted. They didnt seem to be to busy. I started to notice other concerned customers. Once I got my food I tasted a few things that didnt look right when given to us. Fried rice was not fully done and chicken etc... so demanded a refund. Also said loudly that they all need to get it together. Kinda funny... 2 kids cooking whats supposed to be chinese gourmet. The whole staff were kids and far from professional. Bunch of unmotivated people. THIS IS A BAD LOCATION NOT MY 1ST  BAD EXP HERE..."}
{"text":"Very small portions here I eat panda 2,3 times a week when I'm dieting brown rice ,chicken thighs no sauce, and veggies. Smallest portion given here. This location sucks ."}
{"text":"They never give me fortune cookies and they just slap the food into the box, whenever i order walnut shrimp they literally just give me 3 shrimp. The last time i bought food with my boyfriend the broccoli and beef was so dry and then the next time i bought some the broccoli was sooooo soggy."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, tasty and hot. Veggies were fresh, great color and flavor and crisp. Service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"this is one of the most outrageous lines I ever had to wait in then when I finally made it through the line they told me I had to wait for my food to be done. 15 min later my food is still isn't done if I could give this place zero stars I would. they didn't even accommodate me in any way for the wait I will never be spend my money here ever again."}
{"text":"Just literally here.. worst team of people working I have ever experienced. They fucked up multiple people's orders not just mine. They charged me for he wrong things and didn't seem to give a crap about refunding anyone for the over charges. Additionally the food quality was sub par. The fried rice was so half assed it did not taste or look like friend rice. It was more like mush. Al the items were not being replaced with new ones as often as they should have been. And I hate to say it- none of it tasted like Chinese food. Admittedly there were no Asians on staff and mainly Hispanic cooks - not trying to be racist but literally actually tasted like they used more Mexican spices than Asian spices in the food. The right hand didn't know what he left hand was doing and no manager seemed to be on duty. I live right around the corner and will never go to this location again. Simply put this location sucks and it's not worth it !"}
{"text":"Food was old, dry, and, cold. U never get enough food and there is a bunch of food that is not ready. Overall it is a waste of ur money and time.  If I could, I would rate it a .0000002 star"}
{"text":"This team was swamped and yet they gave excellent service, kept up with the orders and had people in and out of line in record time. All the while they were smiling and helpful. I absolutely love this Panda Express location!  The portions are both generous and extremely tasty.  It is my favorite place to indulge my love of Chinese fast food after a long day at work or play.  As a long time Las Vegan, I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"The only reason I leave 3 stars is because I've come in a couple times when there's no line and the food was cold and old. This is like any other Panda Express though in that sense.  It's just sad that if I want fresh/hot food, I have to plan to go during one of the rush hours.  Moral of the story: Go there when there's a Lunch or Dinner rush for the best, freshest, and hottest food.   Brown rice is amazing though, and good for you :))"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible had a terrible experience with Gemmalynn  B she was the server and \"she said she was \"comanager we went through the drive-through got no forks no teriyaki sauce no cookies no fortune cookies-  nothing that came with our meal. The Chowmain  was dry - we got home we realize nothing was in the bag that we ordered and then we called to complain and she said what am I supposed to do as my response was probably make your customers happy and she said Ha !! First  when the lady answered anshanded her the phone initially she said oh another complaint horrible horrible panda express horrible"}
{"text":"I like another reviewer....Chinese-ish...lol! Well I'd have to agree on that one!  Best items here I think are: walnut shrimp ($1 more), string bean chicken and eggplant. I always opt for noodles because their rice is so dry...but even the noodles are not the greatest...but again it's fast and decent.  I like that they have the peach diet green tea....kids meal is not worth it, might as well get a 1 item combo for just a little more. No prize or dessert....don't bother. I don't recommend drive thru either they skimp in servings. All in all it's OK....at least no msg."}
{"text":"Huge serving size makes my day. Filling meals for a low cost. One of the problems this franchise have is that there chowmein or rice sis sometimes super bland and it than its like eating plain rice or just boiled noodles with veges."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with this location. I always order the same dish. Chow Mein and a double order of Kung Poa Chicken. Every time I order this it taste different. Last night I had orange chicken and teriyaki chicken mixed in. I went through the drive thru so I am assuming the Kung Poa was pretty much gone so to move the line quicker they threw in different chicken to fill my order. The chow mein tasted weird yesterday also. This location needs to get their crap together or I'll no longer be going here. Oh, I also think they should get rid of the styrofoam to-go containers and do like the location in Norterra does and place it in the plastic ones. That way the sauce is not falling out all over my fork, napkins, fortune cookies by the time I get home."}
{"text":"I feel like 3.5 stars is the perfect rating for this place.  The food is fairly fresh and the place is usually pretty clean. The service can be hit or miss, but more good than bad. One big annoyance is that there are no changing tables in the restroom."}
{"text":"I was personally victimized by the Vegas Panda Express. I have never felt so violated by a fast food restaurant in my entire life. I am fuming as I am eating my beef and broccoli with fried rice. Apparently it's a huge issue to order a one entree meal instead of two? Sorry I didn't want the bowl cause I don't like my foods touching..... Is that a fricking crime?? I asked very politely but got the eye roll by the entire line of workers. They made such a small request seem like a huge inconvenience. Is it that hard?? Like what is that?!?? Do your fricking job and don't be a bitch people!! What ever happened to customer satisfaction. If the manager is reading this, all those bitches should be fired. Most bizarre and weirdest experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Besides the cool fortune I got, this panda sucks. The rice had old bits of previous rice they didn't cleAn from the pan, and the orange chicken tasted like the wok and old oil. Skip this place and try someplace else! My daughters were not happy, and that means mama ain't happy either! Won't come back."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Jus moved up the street and I was excited about being so close to one of my fave fast food joints. I've been moving boxes all day up and down the stairs and I needed something good to eat.  Came in and only one lady in front of me who reportedly has a shellfish allergy or otherwise and asked questions in which I saw the Mgr or otherwise guy in charge answer her questions and provide good customer service. My initial encounter was with Graciela/Garcia (sp?) she was pleasant enough when I asked for chow mein. She asked me what else I wanted so I walked around the glass so I could see what looked hot and fresh. There were at least 3 empty trays so my options were a little limited. I guess I took too long to speak so she went and helped the lady behind me. I had to speak up to See if I'd done something wrong because I didn't understand why the lady behind me was being helped before me. When I asked, Gracia said that I didn't tell her what I wanted (in a tone that resembled 'I dnt give a f***') Yikes, customer service is not her strong suit. I'm familiar with Panda Express, maybe I wasn't sure, maybe I should've been offered a sample? Or maybe I jus wanted to look at what was hot and fresh and tell the woman helping me what I'd like but instead of waiting on me, she figured she'd skip me and simply help the woman behind me. Bless the Mgr or other head honcho who came and assisted me so I wouldn't be skipped in line by the woman that had been fully helped behind me. He stated that Gracia was new. Seems to me someone should be excited about their new job and leave their attitude in the parking lot. My food is good and I believe the kind gentleman that helped Me and others with patience, his name may be Ramsey or Ramses is doing a great job. The service was slow but outside of the rudeness of serving the customer behind me, I'll try it again. Now if I get some crap happen to me again, I won't be so diplomatic about it next time"}
{"text":"Only one lady serving behind counter on busy Saturday evening...long lines...somewhat unfriendly service..."}
{"text":"This Panda Express location is a difficult one to review.  As is typical of the Panda, the food's good and cooked up fast. No, it's not gourmet Chinese, but it's tasty enough.  But then we come to the weakness of this location: The menu.  The selection is really, really slim. To the point they don't even have sweet and sour chicken, for crying out loud. I'm used to Panda Express locations varying in their options (Potato Chicken and String-Bean Chicken are always hard to come by), but this one really takes the cake as far as limited selection goes."}
{"text":"This place sucks. They ran out sweet fire chicken and they took 15 minutes to cook some more. I was PISSSED! The noodles were pretty dry too."}
{"text":"I would say if you want your order to be wrong, Over Charged for what you do order and like dealing with a company that in 5 out of 6 tries could not complete an order correctly.  And a company that really could care less about its customers then this is the right place to get a meal  If you prefer a comapny that respects its customers then I would say go to any other resturaunt in Pittsburgjh.  Panda Express should be ashamed of themselves for having a business like this and treating customers with absolutely no respect what so ever.  I wish this site had negative stars so I could rate this company as they so deserve.  Safe bet stay far away from this location.  They have actually on one visit tell me white rice would take 10 minutes if I wanted to wait.  I thought this was a Chinese resturaunt"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the closest Panda Express to us and it isn't always great like it should be. Not being racist, but from getting panda for years I've noticed the Asians  are a lot more stingy with giving food than everyone else. That is the case here, and while the food always tastes great, it would be nice to get the amount we deserve when paying so much for it. Also half the time at this place I have to wait several minutes for an entree. That means the lines are generally longer and take forever to get to the end. Luckily I know not all locations are like this which is why I still gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This panda is a hit or miss. Every time we've gotten the Asian lady we get small portions. Every time we get anyone else we get normal or large portions. Food always tastes great though."}
{"text":"One of the better Panda's I've been to. Tastes great as usually and never had to wait long, even with huge lines. They gave a generous amount of food the few times I've gone there."}
{"text":"Typical mall restaurant that you can find almost everywhere! The smell of the food and the price will draw you in and help curve those hangovers then spending lotsa money at the buffet.   When I come here I always order the broccoli and beef with fried rice. Mmmmm   Soup and salad are not enticing like a higher rated Chinese restaurant but hey it gets the job done and the staff here are super friendly and give samples if you ask."}
{"text":"I was in this location that I frequent and me and my family got there at around 915 and we made sure before we got there that this location for sure closed at 10 pm. At around 930, an employee named Andrea, heavy build with glasses, locked all the doors (there were only 2 entrances and she locked both) and started putting up all of the chairs around us. Not only is this unsanitary when there are still guests eating, but rude to customers who are still visiting. She said nothing to us and proceeded to sweep the dining room. Me and my family saw a couple come up to the doors to try to get in at 940 and they couldn't because the doors were locked. No one bothered to let them in. They left unhappy. 5 mins later at 945, still 15 mins before closing Andrea came right up to our table and started sweeping right under our feet without saying anything. I found this to be extremely rude and like she was basically telling us to get out. I have never been so offended at this restaurant. Usually people are so nice here but she was another story. I will say though that our cashier I believe her name was Rozhan was sincere and very sweet."}
{"text":"Went to order some food and all they had left was beef and shrimp. I got 1 shrimp that was it and then later in the night I was awoke in the middle of the night and proceeded to rainbow vomit onto my floor. For the second wind I walked to the bathroom and from judging by the first stream of vomit I was able to stand at just the right distance from the toilet so when I puked again it was a perfect shot while I was a standing up."}
{"text":"I have been there twice since they opened. The orange chicken was pretty good. I didn't like the teriyaki chicken, and the egg rolls were awful. I understand that it just opened, but the wait time was ridiculous for a \"fast food\" restaurant. I can go to a regular Chinese restaurant down the street and my food is ready in less than 15 minutes. I waited at least 20 minutes in the drive thru line at Panda Express. The rice wasn't good either, it tasted like it had been sitting around all day. I would like to try the teas, as the website says they are really good, but I didn't even see them listed on the menu at the drive-thru. I'm guessing they are offered for people who dine in only? Regardless, I will probably go again, but now I have a better idea of what to order. The chicken and mushrooms was decent, but the orange chicken was definitely my favorite!"}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly place to get some Asian cuisine! The staff is wonderful and super friendly and answered any questions I had about the menu . I had the Shanghai beef , orange chicken with Lo Mein noodles. The beef was wonderful and great tasting! The orange chicken tasted like a breaded blab piece of chicken , just not great tasting! If I return definitely I would order the beef , the noodles were great as well. The rice looked dried out. I didn't bother! The outdoor seating was great as well!"}
{"text":"Yuk! Not a big fan of the fried rice change, they are now using brown rice for their fried rice. Not good."}
{"text":"I dont know why so many bad reviews on this panda location.  This particular location has the best tasting food panda restaurant out of maybe 5 that I know of. My work place orders panda once in a while in Henderson and they are nowhere close to the taste that this location makes.   The only problem that I get (sometimes) is that when we order at the drive thru they keep on forgetting to add bbq sauce on my teriyaki bbq chicken. So I have to constantly remind them to add the sauce lol. oh and they give so little meat when you order the angus beef.  The cooks here are the best!"}
{"text":"The girls there are so slow to wait on the people that bother to park and go inside. They're more interested on serving the lazys in the drive thru. I was inside in line for 10 min before anytime spoke to me. I won't be back there's too many other places that would be happy to take my money faster."}
{"text":"Went here for late night dinner, they close at 10pm and I got there at 9:40pm and they locked the door as I walked up even with customers eating inside. An employee motioned me to go to the drive thru, which I did and I should have just kept driving. When I went to order the drive thru employee was barely paying attention. I had to repeat my order 3 times before she finally repeated my order correctly. She told me she would give me my total at the window. Once I got there she asked me to wait because she hadn't even put my order in yet....after waiting another 5 mins she came back and told me the things I ordered weren't being made anymore and that I had to order something else. Placed my new order and waited another 5 mins for her to come back with a soaking wet box covered with sauce. Once home, the food was overcooked and the portions were way smaller then I have ever seen from a Panda Express. My beef and broccoli was 90% broccoli with dry \"beef\". I'm never going back to this location and it has severely ruined my chance at ever trying Panda Express again."}
{"text":"Food is bomb at Panda Express. I've never had their walnut shrimp or beaf broccoli before but it was delicious. The reason why they only get 3 stars is because the customer service sucked. The lady taking my order was very impatient and rude. She kept questioning my choices in what I wanted. She was rushing me when there wasn't anyone behind me. I liked the food but I didn't like the service. I ordered two bowls. One bowl with orange chicken, beef broccoli, and chow mein. The other bowl was filled with chow mein, honey walnut shrimp, and orange chicken."}
{"text":"Yeah I'll be out here drop in bars with that pad to express to be amazing yo I've never had panda express like this profile so glad everybody got a dollar even got nice people and let you know they got people in that would be nice nice nice often do you meet nice people are nice places never happen you know bless you and bless our house by Sears and got in at nine you a lot and never go to McDonald's again from the East Coast to the West Coast honey love one less friend for life baby do you know where reviews all the time day or night Monday through Friday"}
{"text":"For being Panda, I expected better! On the strip, I expected better...  The steamed brown rice was underdone... Crunchy. The string bean chicken.. Beans were freezer burned, the dish was old and tasted of smoke. The sweet fire chicken was OLD and again tasted only of smoke. The Kung pao chicken was Old and the vegetables looked gross. The orange chicken was old! The chow main was old.... The wild cod stuff..very fishy tasting... Old fish.. Yuck.  See a theme here? I wonder if the panda at the food court by M&M world would have been better. Either way, I am now turned off of panda for a longtime."}
{"text":"Worst Panda Express ever. Tables were dirty. Food was over cooked. Employees were very rude. Service was very slow. They didn't have any brown rice. There are other Panda Express restaurants that are just as busy but still manage to do all that is needed to keep the customers happy. Glad there are others because I'll just go to the ones that appreciate my business."}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service.  This was my fourth visit to this establishment and have been treated well each time.  Food is good, also."}
{"text":"Food was warm  Service was quick  Table were not clean but they were busy  Every entree was available to order  You can tell when it's a good Panda Express, looks managed well vs others I visited."}
{"text":"Long lines Mismanaged customer intakes 2 people on break while only one person is serving long lines of people time was 3:41pm Friendly staff just inconvenient long line"}
{"text":"Kung pao chicken was disgusting (a lot of fat) Shrimp was cold and only got 4 pieces :( Service wasn't that great the first girls were nice come to the cashier/manager she was overwhelmed and there were other managers watching her and not helping from behind the counter. Most food was running out, they made people go ahead of me for no reason which made my wait longer. I think this would be a last at this non-express panda. The managers I commented about were there in the behind area joking around while the customers had a miserable experience and food was cold. Not sure if it was cold from the start or they made me wait so long it became cold ;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff Fantastic service Fresh food Everything was available No long line  Why 2 stars? Well your food container are half the size everywhere else :/ I don't know if you guys were out or trying to cut on food cost but I expect same container as any other Panda, I received a little over half the food I normally get at any other Panda Express:(((("}
{"text":"This is the ultimate hangover spot in Vegas. Me nd my friends slightly tipsy nd majorly hungry stopped by here round midnight nd they were luckily still open. Needless to say we pigged out :D open later than chipotle nd if ur bold u can defiantly try ur luck at the soda machine. Just pretend ur drunk wit no cash"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, there seems to be some outrageous reason why I wait in line for 15 min or longer. Doesn't even need to be busy. Incompetent and/or ignorant employees, I think. I'm like...oh, must need a PHD to cut chicken? I tried giving chances. Now I'm done."}
{"text":"CHEAP + FAST = EASY LUNCH!!!  It's panda express so everyone know what that means cheap, typical, and pretty tasty Chinese food. It's near my job and though there are many other Chinese restaurants this one is quick and I know what I'm getting, and usually I'm lucky to get it right out of the Wok, and even it wasn't--- I still get a bowl to go."}
{"text":"I arrived at 10:02pm. Google has listed 10:30PM as closing time for this location. Employees refused to even make eye contact. Terrible!"}
{"text":"The chef on duty made superior dishes. I love Panda's food, but there are some dishes that I don't want to pay extra for. On Friday, a family member asked for two such items--the walnut shrimp and the premium shanghai angus, so I ordered them both. The way that your chef prepared these dishes was outstanding! The flavors were bold, unique, and truly standout. As an extra bonus, every item was freshly prepared, nothing had been sitting on a steam table getting old & waiting to be served as slop to people who used the drive-thru."}
{"text":"I always get broccoli and beef. This place used to be one of the better Pandas. Now the people and the broccoli and beef are dry. Mr Yuck."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday afternoon and I've just been outvoted. We're heading to Panda Express for a late lunch. I look longingly across the street at the Fry Bread House while I wait to place my order. But you know, it could be worse. This is a nice Panda Express location. It's roomy. It's well staffed. It's clean and well maintained. Television. The workers seem pleasant enough. Service is prompt. Panda Express tends to be a bit of a calorie bomb. If I'm going to indulge, I'd rather commit to caloric food I really love. Today's order? Steamed veggies, chow mien, orange chicken. All solid, but uninspired."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Panda?    Quick Cheap and Good food with lots of options.    This location was very clean service was good and Orange Chicken is still the bomb."}
{"text":"I like Panda Express but this location sucks!  I am not sure why some Panda locations get great reviews and other not so much. I will not be back to this location due to mistakes in ordering and filling and order correctly. It has happened twice on my on-line/drive through orders. Why give us the ability to tell you what we want if you are going to ignore it? Sloppy at best. Low standards. Lacking in training and follow through.   There are plenty of locations close by...keep driving. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Veronica was very friendly and helpful. She seemed very genuine. A real delight and asset to your company. A true smile goes a long way."}
{"text":"Always fresh, a bit of a wait in drive through sometimes but not too long. This is a great location with great Panda Express food!"}
{"text":"A drive thru that takes forever!!!   I was trapped because there is no way out once you're stuck in line.  Definitely not FAST food...  do not stop if you're in a hurry"}
{"text":"Horrible, food has always been good, service on the other hand is the WORST!! Two horrible experiences now, this time we left without any food after a half an hour wait!!!! So pissed right now"}
{"text":"If u r n a hurry skip this place. Staff is rude and they are out of lots of items. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"The food was good but was missing my egg rolls and the veggies in the chow mein were so big I had to cut them all up myself. Also the cream cheese ragoons didn't have cream cheese in them had to fill them up with some whipped cream cheese. The rice was flavour less extra soy sauce did it (which they didn't give me)I've been here many times before and the food was good but these last two times I have been missing food. New management? Don't know, but hope they as before where everything was good and employees were fast and polite."}
{"text":"Every Panda Express is amazing, but this one stood out.   Very friendly workers.  As usual, they offered us samples. A little less seating than the average Panda, but who cares? You're eating yummy Panda Express food!  :)"}
{"text":"They like to rip off there customers by double charging and giving less food. They charged us $18.00 for a one plate 2 item combo that costs $6.80. There customer service says they charged us correctly. We will NEVER come back again."}
{"text":"Walking around the miracle mile mall in Las Vegas ...we were looking for something a bit different. Stopped into Panda Express it was our first time. The menu was simple. The story was excellent and the food delicious  We will be back!! And looking forward to it"}
{"text":"I love the way this location cooks their Orange Chicken. It's tangy and spicy, and cut into smaller pieces so it stays crispier (not all Pandas cook it the same). I did come in once an hour before closing and was told the white rice was gone. That was a bummer, but oh well. The OC was really good and made up for it."}
{"text":"Typical Panda fast food cuisine. This location better then some of the others locally. Usually clean inside, food is hot and the new summer late night hours are a plus for the midnight muncher (even though they close at 11p I think)"}
{"text":"I will never spend my money here again.  The food is always soggy and cold! And the staff is the worst I've seen in a long time. The three employees there today were either high as a kite or they absolutely hate their jobs!  There is another Panda Express right up the road from this location with great customer service and fresh food.   Don't waste your money at this location(shea and tatum)!!!"}
{"text":"It is really nice to have one really close to the house the staff are very friendly and have great customer service. The only complaint I have is that ordering on line it gives you a time that it will be ready for pick up. Well that didn't happen.  I will keep going here and ordering on line as that is really convenient."}
{"text":"I often get takeout from PE because I can simply order and pay online while I'm at work and I can get it on my way home, usually without any waiting time. The bigger plate for roughly $9 is a very good deal, always fills me up.  The food however varys a lot in quality and freshness. Sometimes the noodles or chicken will be old and dry , sometimes they are super fresh. Sometimes no veggies at all, other times too much. If this wasn't the case I would be happy to give 5 stars, they do a good job."}
{"text":"As always, Panda delivers. The manager here, a young Asian woman, is a good manager but overly serious. Even her cashier tried to get her to crack a smile to no avail. So, cashier was funny, and fast.  Clean place, good service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had:( I hate writing bad reviews, but the employees just seemed miserable (girl working told me she was working open to close. To the manager: get the schedule together, man). It doesnt help that the hours online are different than the actual hours that are posted on the door, not employees fault but definitely something that needs to be fixed. I was picking up an order for postmates, line out the door last 30 minutes they were open and refused to make anything! But I watched them make a small portion of everything they were out of for one of their regular customers, ridiculous!:( this girl had the guts to tell me, \"well if the customer calls and complains about their order, it's not our problem!\" uhh...kinda is though.... I don't know. Save yourself the frustration and go to Pei Wei next door. At least they will actualy give customers the food they are wanting"}
{"text":"Happy enough - not perfect but good value.  Arrived on a Friday between 12-1. Step right up, only one customer in front of me.  Maybe their lunch rush had already come through. There were 2 cooks and 2 servers. Very pleasant people. The warming trays were mostly empty. As I took what was likely the second to last serving of one item, the server called to the cook to make more.   2 item combo meal. Kung Pao chicken and walnut shrimp. I didn't pay attention to the menu but it seems the shrimp had a small up-charge. No big deal. Both were hot, well portioned and the flavors were tasty.  The prep and dining areas were clean."}
{"text":"The employees are very nice and helpful and the sun doesn't get in your eyes during the afternoon because of the location. My only issue with the place is they don't have chopsticks out with the forks. It would be easier to access that way. Parking is okay sometimes."}
{"text":"Very nice and quick service, I noticed Veronica in-particularly was able to multitask very well, thank you for the quick in and out (to go) service"}
{"text":"They should Cook and have food on hand until closing, not pay attention to cleaning floors and store to get out early."}
{"text":"I... never really had a problem with this location. I've been going for months, and despite the wait times whether you're in the drive thru, or inside the store. You always seem to get exactly what you pay for. I've never had an issue with the food, or customer service. The closing team from the 5th of January were working hard and fast, with an impressive amount of patience. An absolute must for the fast-food business. One employee in particular, I believe her name tag said 'Alex' was all over the place! Helping with the drive-thru and the floor, and keeping the bar behind the counter tidy. But it's not to discredit the other workers who were at their spot. Everyone was on their toes, rather than standing around, waiting for someone to tell them what to do...   I like it when everyone takes their time. I feel comfortable that way instead of watching them rush themselves. Attention to detail, and not sweating on the food from the hard work...  As I said before, I've been visiting this location for months. Nothing has happened to stop me from going anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not sure who is telling the truth, the website or the workers. Went to the pandas at 930pm, they told me they were closed. No one actually told me they were closed, the guy cleaning up stood at the windows and pulled out his phone to check the time and made a \"no\" motion with his head motioning to not come in. Website says 10-10 with an \"open now\" indicator. Great customer service btw."}
{"text":"Just opened! Nice, bright, shiny-new, and a drive-thru to boot. Try the spring rolls...yummy. Love svhrimp egg roll. . mice n crispy, not greasy. Great service and menu options."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner here with my mom and got the angus steak. Bit it in half to see that it was uncooked and even had blood oozing from it. Very disappointed and lost my appetite after. Also the noodles and orange chicken were dry and over cooked"}
{"text":"I try and stay away from Chinese fast food.  I don't know why... it's just who I am.  But, there are times that I can be purely lazy and have a hankering for some Broccoli Beef and steamed rice.  Anyhow, Panda Express is close and easy to get to.  So, here is my review of tonight's visit.:   - I drive over to Sam's Town, which has the closest Panda Express to me.  I park in the 2nd parking lot, on the ground floor.   - I walk in to the North East entrance and Panda is right there on the left.    - There wasn't a line and I ordered my meal.  I had to wait a couple of minutes as they were replenishing their stock.  So, I had fresh Broccoli and Beef.  Woo Hoo!!!   - I paid and then left...  easy as that.    My meal was okay but nothing to give it 4 or 5 stars.  With that said, it's an okay place to go if you are in a hurry and are too lazy to make your own rice."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Panda Express. The food is too sweet and greasy for quality food, let alone Chinese food, and it's overpriced. Since my family likes it, though, I've been to several around town. This particular store always looks clean and inviting, and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Panda Express- they just seem so boring to me.  Their foods are pretty fast-food, pedestrian, ho-hum. Fine for a quick fix.  I can't score them poorly because they do their job just fine.  The restaurant seems clean and although the line is a bit long sometimes, service appears to be pretty steady.  I rarely go to Panda Express but if you know exactly what you want here, it's an easy place to pop into for a quick meal or takeout."}
{"text":"When one eats at Panda, one does not expect the food to taste like anything more like Panda. It is fast food at its core, and should never be graded like anything more than what it is (like a local business per se). That being said, I like to grade fast food based on the quality of their service, and this specific Panda Express location definitely stepped up to the plate.   Upon entering, one presents himself with an entirely different atmosphere compared to other Panda locations. The building itself is clean. Very clean. Every time someone left, even if the place was empty, they would hurriedly make it their duty to wipe that empty table clean in the case that the next customer wanted to perhaps sit there.   The interior design. Sleek and modern, with neutral colors everywhere of black, brown and white, and the single eye-popping red to ascertain one's eyes to the menu. I personally like the choice in chandeliers, all spherical and round to avoid making everything look too blocky.   But enough about the interior decor; let's talk about the service.   When we entered the shop, we were greeted by a nice, confident young woman who patiently let us sample almost every single dish on the menu before choosing our choice of 3 sides. This was due to the fact that it has been so long since my companions and I visited a Panda that we generally forgot what's good and not good. With that being the case, the women did not even look the least bit annoyed! If she was, she didn't show it. Haha. Very patient and understanding!  As we ordered our food, it was served plentiful. I don't remember how Panda food was before, but I do remember the sizes of their portions and how they were so stingy, especially when it comes to shrimp! However, they the lady served so much food on our platter that it looked to be overflowing. She even brought the food out to us as we waited in our seat.   One cool addition that they have here is the Panda Tea Bar. I don't know if this is at every location, or maybe if I'm just too outdated, but I never knew Panda Express made boba! Of course, you shouldn't order it expecting the boba pearls to be completely fresh, and the milk tea to taste like anything original, but it is what it is. It's a nice alternative to those who don't want normal fountain drinks and others who don't always want to get water cups.   4 stars from this Panda!"}
{"text":"This is a standard Panda Express.  The food tastes the way it should and the staff is friendly and fast.  The location is the best part of this place.  It is right off the 95 in the shopping area near Costco, DSW, and Best Buy.  The only way this location would be better is if it had a drive through.   Son likes the orange chicken, as does the husband.  Husband also enjoys the fried rice and anything deep fried.  For a healthy option, the mandarin chicken with steamed rice is the ticket!"}
{"text":"Good solid Panda Express.  It is in the Meadows Mall.  There is never too long of a line.  When I walked up and ordered a Panda bowl with vegetables side.  They made the veggies fresh while I waited.  Then I added the peppercorn shrimp.  I wish I go more than 6 shrimp with the veggies that come with the peppercorn shrimp, but my whole meal was a total of 270 calories.  It was filling and tasted good.  I enjoyed it.    When I am not on a diet, I enjoy the cream cheese ragoons.  The mall is right across from my work.  I have no complaints about this place."}
{"text":"Well the food is panda express quality. My girlfriend and i used their drive through. The staff were super friendly and helpful and worked with us and helped us pick a delicious (probably not so healthy) dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a quick bite as we were hanging out at Red Rock. Service was fairly quick, but their portion sizes aren't as good as other locations. We had orange chicken (of course), string bean chicken and a chicken egg roll. The girls were nice but you could tell they were short-handed for a Friday night."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Panda Express for years. And now we know why. Not good.  I realize its fast food, but so is Chipotle. Everything is fried chicken with honey/orange flavoring sauce. They did have steamed brown/white rice or vegetables but I didn't go there for the healthy options.  The place was somewhat clean and the staff was somewhat friendly...they put food on our plate. I'll be back in another 5 years--maybe."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express, except for this location in 51st Ave & Baseline - poor service plus the portions gets smaller and smaller. I love the Panda Express on 24th Street & Baseline."}
{"text":"If you're gluten free don't expect to order anything other than the white rice. And they don't even have gluten free soy sauce!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Panda food... And this place doesn't  exactly have the friendliest people."}
{"text":"I used to come to this location all the time when I worked right down the street.  Today I happened to be in the area, and went through drive up to get my usual order.  VERY fast delivery of the order, which impressed me, then I pulled out one of the cream cheese rangoons and it was hard as a rock.  Not over cooked, but chewy and hard edges.  I tried another one, thinking that one was stale/freezer burned or something, but nope, all 3 of them were basically inedible.  I got back to my office, and carrying the bag I was thinking it felt really heavy.  I ask for easy rice or noodles whenever I order, because I won't eat all that and it just goes to waste.  I popped open the container and saw everything all over the place.  First, the honey walnut shrimp looked like it was pressed and then scraped on a meat grinder.  The walnut pieces were clustered together in one clump under the shrimp.  The mandarin chicken looked like it had been sitting in coffee grounds then sauce thrown over it.  The chicken was squishy, not firm or well cooked.  I had a huge pile of rice that had stale dried peas and carrots, and some of the rice looked burned.  Basically I picked out what I thought I could eat, and tossed the rest.  I didn't trust the shrimp without taking the remainder of the batter/coating off and the chicken I ended up throwing away because I didn't like how it looked or the texture which looked old/stale to me.  Very VERY disappointed in the quality of the food, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because of how fast the food was served."}
{"text":"I don't care to review a panda but this one is over the top dirty. The food tastes old and soggy like It's been at the wrong temperature for days and going. It's strange how can something get old if they are selling quickly. Still I don't care about my money I care about the animals they killed to let food go to waste that's a waste.   The pieces that should be green on the chow mein were brown. The meat was soggy had quite a side taste and ultimately it felt old. I ended up not eating most of it.   I told my friend about it she told me her sister got food poisoning from the food at this location. I just ate this 30 minutes ago I have to wait a little...     Should be a while before I know."}
{"text":"I know I know.  It's like a sin for me to have Panda Express because I'm Asian.  But, in the city of sin, it's okay to commit sins, right?  At least that was my logic (although I also eat Panda Express outside of the city of sin, but that is not the point!)  I was looking for some comfort food and was craving white rice, fried rice, or chow mein.  We walked in and I was a little bit giddy.  I always order the Chicken and String Bean, so I got that and my friend picked the Pepper Chicken.  We shared one of those two entree dealios with half chow mein and half fried rice.  The lady at the cash register was a little bit rude.  I asked if I could have an extra plate for us to split the meal and she looked at me like I was crazy.  We didn't get any napkins, so I asked her if I could have some.  As she's staring at the register, she waves me off and says \"behind you.\"  Okay lady.  I sat down, smelled the food, and smiled.  I only had a banana and some tater tots for breakfast/brunch and it was about 2:30PM, so I was starving!  I took a bite of the chicken and string bean and it totally hit the spot.  I pretty much devoured my half of the food, and sat there rubbing my little food belly.  We had a bunch of different tasks to get done for the Bachelorette Party/Bridal Shower, so a quick and yummy meal was perfect.  Just an FYI, this is inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino in the Miracle Mile Shops area."}
{"text":"The servers are super rude and mean.  Service super bad Not coming back Super disappointed My daughter cry when she open her kids meal. She order coconut shrimp and chow Mein and I paid an extra 1.25 for 4 shrimps. The lady super rude  didn't want to add any pecans gravy nothing else...  So sad see your daughter crying that way when they are super hungry after there after school programs...  Also I order another bowl for me. I just want chicken and the lady wants to give me wherever she wanted.  Please hire friendly people. I just go there because my nephew works there in the kitchen that's all but we never come back again."}
{"text":"I was STARVING after the club. Ended up walking across and stumbled upon the only place that was open.  They were closing up but I made it just in time.  They had a couple plates of food already packaged and were selling them for $4 a box! What a steal! Came with chow mein and two items. I think one of them was the ribs and some orange chicken! Boy that hit the spot!  Thank you Panda!"}
{"text":"Visited around 11:30 this Wednesday. Restaurant was clean and tidy. Table was also clean and almost all dishes were full - you could tell BOH was hard at work! We were served by Liz and a manager with braces. Both were highly professional. To add, Liz was extremely friendly and helpful - I changed my drink order a million times and she remained patient with a smile the whole time! The only reason I'm giving four stars is that some of the food could have been fresher - the veggies had been sitting for a while and the chow mein tasted stale (almost like it was missing an ingredient). Otherwise great visit. We really appreciated the high quality of customer service!"}
{"text":"First time  at this location. The line was so long I think it was 13 people total in line and I was in the back. Took 30min or so for me to order and walk. Several workers were clumsy and dropped a bunch of pans which was sooo loud. It seems to me they can't handle a busy crowd. I don't know who or where the manager was, but neither of these employees acted like a manger. My serving size was good and the food was good, but that's about it. Everyone was looking irritated by how slow they were."}
{"text":"This is the second time coming to this location. It's always so slow! I ordered white rice, orange chicken, and Beijing beef with cream rangoo and now I am throwing up none stop! Totally food poisoned. Be careful eating here, k seriously don't think I can eat at another fast food place again. Just thinking about it is making me nauseas! My friend also ordered from here the same time I did and she is nauseas as well! Did you people spit it in or something???"}
{"text":"I like Panda Express. It's fresh and quick. You're usually in and out quickly. This Panda Express is the exception. It takes much longer to get you food. I'd say that it takes twice as long as other Panda Express restaurants with a similar number of customer in line.   To the owner: I want to spend more money at your restaurant. Help make my experience better and I will return. Here's how:  1) Use the assembly line approach to move your line along.   You had five employees working when I visited. It looks like you're adequately staffed. Have one employee work the rice and chow mein. That employee passes the plate to the next employee who serves your customer their entrees, the second employee then passes the plate onto the third employee which is your cashier. Your other two employees stay in the kitchen and cook your delicious food.  That's it, all you have to do is make your employees work smarter, not harder. The longer I wait in line the longer it takes me to forget the bad experience I had at your restaurant and the longer it takes me to come back and spend my money at your restaurant:"}
{"text":"Not really much to say.  Food was really good and the service at this location was good as well."}
{"text":"After 30 mins and trying to get the $3 off min of $5 order (per their yelp promo), they were not able to honor the promotion... ended up getting my refund and going else where for food... will wait to see when my refund comes back... too bad! Now I have a useless app on my phone and they now have my information... ugh! Disappointing!"}
{"text":"The food is good, they load up the plates and everyone is happy. After giving up Panda Express for years, this place made me a believer. Love their noodles! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try Panda Express, ordered online for pickup. Got there 8 minutes past pickup time waited almost 15 minutes before someone helped me and two other guest for pickup. They were busy but not overwhelming. Overall I got the firecracker chicken with orange chicken and fried rice. The meal itself was okay.  I would try again."}
{"text":"I wish there was a zero star option for yelp. One of the worst pandas I've been to. Our food was hardly heated, and by I mean hardly heated I mean I wish they had a microwave to heat this shit up. Customer service was awful, rude and talked openly with each other instead of engaging with customers."}
{"text":"This is the second time I had to reported Panda Express to Corporate office...   The drive thru wait time is horrible, This is the second time I have waited in the parking lot for over 20 mins, for my family order.  I had to call and speak to the Manager, who seem like he doesn't care at all, or understand about good customer service...   I really don't get it, whats the problem at this location..   Dysart and even the Watson location seem to have basic understand that customers is the reason, they have a job??      SMH......"}
{"text":"This was one of my regular (once every couple of months) lunch stops working in Chicago loop and it was never my favorite, but it was a decent standby when you wanted pseudo Chinese food and were in a hurry. Everything was always fast, but hot and fresh.   THIS location is new and has a drive-thru, which is great, but during my visit for dinner around 7pm Thurs the food seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile. I ordered the sweet fire chicken - very dried out, lo mein - also very dry, no sauce at all and had a few lousy onions in it (can you add a few veggies at least?). Also, they really should offer tofu/vegetarian dishes - no eggplant and tofu here - and no tea bar which they offer at other locations I guess outside of Ohio. I'd go just for bubble tea if they sold that here!  For now, I'll just stick to Imperial Dragon when I want Chinese in the area. It's better quality and almost the same price.   Positive - the drive-thru staff were so friendly and everything was packed up quickly for my order."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this review comes with a poor taste in my mouth.   I am a huge fan of Panda Express and am super happy they've finally come to Canada.  I'm hoping quickly they open a second location because this location is horrible.  I've been to this location 5 times, 4 of which I had waited for over 5 minutes to be helped.  THIS IS A WALK UP CAFETERIA STYLE STORE  I've watched as the staff behind the counter would rather talk and joke amongst themselves then attend to a paying customer.  A second visit showed the staff speaking amongst themselves in another language laughing and giggling.  I waited for a full 5 minutes which doesn't seem long but if you are the second of only 2 customers it's an eternity.  The food was cold and portions were small.  For 15 dollars I will be taking my money elsewhere. Thanks Panda Express but until your store understand customer service, I won't be back.    Signed,  Sad but loyal customer"}
{"text":"I've been very satisfied with the service and food but the last 2 times I asked for hot mustard and they were out. If they don't carry it anymore you should let the customer know. Other than that I'm a fan of Panda Express."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Beijing beef and Kung Pao Chicken. Staff was nice and me entrees were fresh. My issue was the Chow Mein. It had almost no flavor and the onions overpowered the texture."}
{"text":"Worst Panda I have ever gone to. Trays are always empty(I work by this one on Mondays and every single time I have come here I have to wait for even basics like chow mein. Customer service is horrible. I asked for white rice and the lady taking my order rolled her eyes. Then she barked orders and at the guy ringing people up and I wasn't even done ordering. I wanted beef and broccoli but all that was in the tray was broccoli so I asked for the fresh stuff sitting on the counter and again I got eyes rolled at me. I asked for a side of grilled chicken and she said it's not her job and Nate would ring me up. Uh hello...you asked me what I wanted wth? Meanwhile the manager is on he cook line grilling chicken and not even paying attention to how her customers are being treated. This panda is severely under staffed. One cook trying to keep up with a drive thru and inside customers. Good luck. It's a recipe for failure. Speaking of recipe I'm not to sure what the deal is but his pandas beef and broccoli and string bean chicken was bland AF. I'm out. Never coming back here again and according to all the reviews on here a lot of other people are not either. Too many lunch choices out there to have to deal with this."}
{"text":"Oh man. Why I don't learn my lesson I don't know. I love Pandas food but the service seems to be getting worse. Portion size at this location is a joke. Not even full scoops. The girl behind the counter looked like she was scared to scoop the food. Then when I went to check out the lady literally walked away to clean the soda station. Then she walked back over and looked at me like I was a nuisance. She didn't offer me soy sauce or a fortune cookie. I wanted the Shanghai Steak And The new steak and shrimp but both dishes looked like they had been sitting there for a long time so I passed. All my food was cold as well. I know it's just panda and I shouldnt expect much but geez. At least get the basics right. That's 2 pandas on this side of town I will never visit again. Get it together Panda I like your food but the service sucks. Update: panda reached out to me about my recent review and sent me a $10 gift card. Goes a long way I. My book and and shows they care. I'll update my review to reflect the excellent customer service. Thank you Panda ."}
{"text":"Been to this Panda before and it's just like all Pandas but this one seemed a bit more stingy with there serving sizes. My daughter ordered a chow mien bowl with sweet fire chicken. They gave her like 5 pieces so I asked for extra and they literally put one more piece in her bowl.  All the food was fresh and tasted great like usual. The place was clean. All portions were very small compared to other pandas I have gone too. The plates may be the reason for the smaller portions. Now they just need the new burrito they have in CA."}
{"text":"I was on may way home and was about to drive by this Panda but I decided instead to feed my cravings.  Paul rang up my order. He did an ok job. There were a couple trays empty or near empty so my choices were cut down my 2. They were not going to refill the pans because it was close to closing, the place was empty and I could tell the cooks were cleaning and wrapping up for the night.  I picked the Bigger Plate ($8.30) My 3 options were: Broccoli Beef. Pretty good. Broccoli was fine, beef a little chewy. String Bean Chicken. Good. The sauce had congealed a bit but it still ended up being pretty tasty. Orange Chicken. This pan at the counter had the most so I felt it was probably the freshest. Paul put a decent helping on my plate. There were very few deep fried pieces of nothing that are common with these types of dishes.   I also had the fried rice which was fine.   Like Lauren M. however, I was also charged for something I didn't get. Well, to be honest, I'm not sure what it is:  CMN Hospital / Leader  $0.03  I know, it's only 3 cents but what the hell is it? If it's a donation, then ask the customer but regardless, you can't charge customers for something that they don't order or agree to. No Bueno.  Clean Facility Decent Food. Good portion / price ratio. Charge for unknown. 2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Come here on ocassion since I work just down the street. The latinos who cook the food dont disappoint since some Panda Express locations food taste off but not here which is why I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"They seemed to keep up with the food well and were always working to make sure they had fresh and hot dishes. Pretty tasty for fast food Chinese."}
{"text":"Really. Bad. Customer service !!  I trying to drink passion tea !!   And I. Asking to manager for more. And !  Hi say. That. You can drink. Other.  Drinks  ! I will not waste  a bag the tea for a cup. I'm frecuent. Customer!!!"}
{"text":"Surprising reviews on here. You go to Panda for the quick unauthentic oriental dinner fix, not for gourmet honey walnut prawns and chow mein. Their wait times can be a bit longer than you'd expect for fast food but this particular location makes up for that with their excellent customer service. Whoever is leading or managing this location is doing an excellent job keeping a service oriented team in an industry plagued by moody privileged teens ungrateful of carrying a paycheck home and just plain ol' people that shouldn't be in the world of customer service. They make every attempt to greet everyone who steps inside. Their serving line could use some improvement in waste management and making it more efficient (less people on the serving line) as we have had a couple orders gone wrong, but again, even when an order is messed up, their customer service is unyielding. There aren't workers who are passive aggressive or whispering frustrations under their breath, they are genuinely accountable. Because of this we don't mind coming back again and again. Out of the handful of times we've been there, there has been a time when all of the different entrees were the same exact sourness with the same exact flavor through and through-chicken and beef tasted exactly the same! The cook likely changed the standard corporate ingredients and did his own thing. So bad.   Other than longer-than-average fast food wait times and the said incident, this is a fine Panda Express with customer service that blows away the abysmal customer service in much of the area in Cleveland Heights and surrounding. 4 stars maybe 3.5 if I could, for what this restaurant is...express oriental food!"}
{"text":"Went through drive through and they messed up every order but one. I was sure to be very clear and legible while ordering (in hopes this doesn't happen) however they didn't even give me and my family the correct food. Half of the food was right and half of the food was something we didn't even order."}
{"text":"Standard Panda Express menu... Always love the orange chicken with fried rice. They know how to get people served quickly and on to their gate. Even under the rush of the crowds, they still smile and treat you well."}
{"text":"Yes, I know this is a chain and its not authentic Chinese food, but hey, when you are in a pinch for some quick fast Chinese food, this has been our go to place. #1 - its a drive thru!! #2 - its a hot, greasy, delicious meal every time. #3 - its cheap.  My husband and I always get the half and half (half fried rice and half chow mein), beef and broc, and I get whatever spicy dish they have. So far I have experienced good service and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Parking was easy, the line was quick, the food was fresh and the staff was friendly!  I recommend if you have the craving for Chinese and want it quick!"}
{"text":"Love Panda Express but there's a girl who works the drive thru who's rude as hell every time I go."}
{"text":"Fast service with a smile decent food even though not the best for you. They accept $100 bills only noting that because jimmy johns in the same parking lot doesn't. I will come back was in and out in minutes. People seem happy about their job."}
{"text":"I grew up with a Panda Express in my mall in Florida, and have always thought of it as decent (&cheap) for fast food/caf style Chinese food. (under $10 gets you two entrees, a starch option, two veg springs rolls, and a small drink - and you can get out for less) Even when I started visiting the stand alone locations or hitting the drive-thrus on my travels elsewhere - every time it was fairly consistent flavors, good customer service, and full portions... so I'm not sure what is going on at this location.  I know it's not a Charlotte-wide quality difference (like let's say, local Sonny's BBQ) because I've been to others in the city - this one is just sub par. Low quantity of normal entrees, hard to understand employees, not to mention reaaaaally pushy on the samples (I know, a weird thing to complain about but some days I just don't want fried shrimp and the fact that I actually had to take the toothpicks from his hand, walk over to the garbage can, and throw the food out for him to get the point is ridiculous) and it just tastes a little off. Portions were also smaller than normal, which is a no go for me when I can usually get a meal and a snack, or even two meals out of a normally filled to-go box.   It gets its second star because the food really is still edible, and if I were ever stuck at South and Tyvola dying for some Panda Express I'd eat here again. And the chain does have some \"wok smart\" entrees with under 250 calories a serving (anywhere from 5 - 20something fat grams) that are still pretty decent."}
{"text":"Sheila, and the rest of the staff are always fantastic! Sheila always greets all the customers with a warm smile and makes the experience pleasant every time. As a business owner myself, I can tell you that she is a great asset for your company.  Overall, the entire staff is fantastic and the food is tasty and a good value.   I always come back to this location multiple times a week"}
{"text":"Way OVERPRICED garbage,the chow mein is tasteless same as the rice just plain terrible,Orient food cooked by Mexicans,1 service worker sometimes with ten folks in line equals a LONG wait,for the price of the orange chicken you would thing you were getting Kobe steaks served too you,lol"}
{"text":"I went Panda Express and one of the employees yelled at me for reaching over the counter and  grabbing a napkin. I was shocked because this employee had no reason to talk to me like that. I think the customer service is horrible based on this one experience. However, I have given two starts because I enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I know that Panda Express is probably not any healthier for you than any other fast food restaurant. However when I'm eating noodles or rice it just feels like a better choice than french fries and burgers. I love the orange chicken in fact I usually get that every time I come. I find that it is highly satisfying although I seem to be hungry quickly after I eat here. Still find myself coming back a couple of times a week, because the food is so great. Everyone here seems to be in a good mood too so they must like their jobs."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this location as they cooked my chicken to perfection. Great atmosphere & friendly staff. The GM displayed great customer service as well as other associates. The store takes customer satisfaction very important for quality assurance."}
{"text":"Panda Express is getting so cheap! They count the shrimp they put in the kids meal... Instead of just putting a scoop in there they gave my daughter 4 shrimp which they charge extra for... I will not be going into a Panda Express again!"}
{"text":"This is and always will be my favorite property of the some I have dined in around the valley. Always clean and a friendly staff. The food is always fresh and hot! Not sure if they changed their prep cooks or their standards but I was a little dissapointsed today. The teriyaki chicken was cut up in all funky sizes...all their food is usually prepared close to bite sizes. Today some I could barely fit in my mouth and some I couldn't put my fork in since it was so small. Maybe I'm too picky? Not sure but that is one thing I've always enjoyed about this place was their prep of the food. Even the orange chicken...golf ball size...yes I know that is what knives are for but I guess I tend to notice little things like that. And way too much sauce over the orange chicken too. Ok, let me stop badgering them...their food is always delicious and we will continue to go their. Today was just a little off-eh! Everyone is entitled to a bad day here and there. And their spring rolls are always a must with our meal and I enjoy their jasmine tea on ice. :-)"}
{"text":"THIS WAS THE WORST PANDA EXPRESS LOCATION I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!! They don't close until 10:30. Online it says 11pm I came at 10:03pm and went through the drive thru. The dumb bitch that was working asked me if i wanted to try the chicken special that they were having I said no thanks can I just get a panda bowl with fried rice and orange chicken. and after i said this she went silent. i proceeded for about 5 minutes to say hello. so i drove to the window and I can see the workers going back and forth sat there for another 5 minutes waiting on them to notice me. I drove around to the front and went to the door where it was locked. so i knocked and there were about 5 workers there they all looked up as if they had just noticed me and mouthed that they were closed and they laughed when i walked back to the car. I am beyond pissed and will be taking this to corporate."}
{"text":"Food is good service is extremely slow.Saturday night 8pm took 20 mins for take out order.If I were the manager would let everyone go and start over.Six people behind the counter doing as little as possible."}
{"text":"Bruh. Nothing sounds better than orange chicken when you're hungover AF and just want something fast in your system.  Right near the chipotle and McDonalds. Good place to come with your group when yall have mixed taste buds and just want something in your system. Inside has limited seating because they share it with the chipotle and a pizza joint but hey, food is food when you're on a budget and hungover, right?"}
{"text":"Terrible service, they delayed certain items and they did not let me know when the items were available."}
{"text":"If you open at 11, have food ready, not make me wait until 11:30.  You are a fast food restaurant. Thank you to cashier who realized and gave a 20% discount."}
{"text":"Love Panda, but they are never prepared. They don't have enough Chow mein or other entrees ready. Then you have a 5-10 min wait. It's 12noon, they should have tons of extras ready."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went in they told me I had to wait for 15 minutes for chicken. Waited 20 minutes and then they put 5 pieces of chicken in my order. Very very very poor service. No apology for time waisted on-top of that you skimp me on my food terrible absolute trash. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Would give them a zero star rating if  I could. Waited in the driver through line for 20 minutes just to place my order. Then waited another 15 minutes for my food to come out their window. By the time I got to eat my food, it was cold, and tasted like it's been sitting for awhile. I'm never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Lol this is a joke. We get there at 10am when it's supposed to open and it wasn't open. We went through the drive through and an automated voice answered us asking if we wanted to try a drink so we said yes and sat there for like 5min. No one even came to get our order, so we went to go inside and it's locked. The employees are staring at us but won't let us in. They could've at least came to tell us they need a few min to cook. And so when we walk back to our car there's three cars in the drive thru and someone's taking their order!  So we left. Sucky and lazy service"}
{"text":"Very fast and efficient as I work nearby and only have a small period of time for lunch.   They give out pretty good portions and will let you taste anything you want. The noodles are decent but the fried rice batches are small so they are usually pretty fresh.   Orange chicken is the go to like with many of the pandas."}
{"text":"The people here don't know what an order is. I have come here a total of 9 times and each time for some reason they have forgotten something included in my order or have completely mixed it up. I'm allergic to seafood yet, 3 times i have received shrimp when i have asked for orange chicken. Each time this happens i have to completely toss the meal. Why do I even bother coming here anymore."}
{"text":"While I was out running some errands I passed Panda Express and wanted to give it a try. I arrived around 12:00 and check out the variety of samplings they offer. Everything from soup, rice, noodles, chicken, shrimp and steak I was torn. I was able to sample some items and decided to go with fried rice, chicken with string beans and beef with broccoli. The fried rice was could have been warmer and was missing a little soy, or flavor. The beef with broccoli was delicious, however the chicken and string beans was covered in a heavy sauce, and could have definitely been warmer, like the rice. Overall it was good, I mean it is a fast food/takeout Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best \"Fast food Chinese\" you will ever have.  The sauces are flavorful, the meats are cooked properly, and it's reasonably priced.  Even the egg rolls are good.  The \"chow mein\" is more like lo mein, but good anyway!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good but the cooks have changed and customer service too. I won't be going back for awhile!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid place to get consistently good food quickly, and it's always clean."}
{"text":"I love the fact you can ask for the food fresh to order if there is a low portion left of the item u selected and sure enough they are kind enough to do it. It may be a wait but we'll worth the wait  who doesn't like fresh food."}
{"text":"Just ordered Black Pepper Chicken for $9.70.  When I got back to my office I discovered that the Black Pepper Chicken had no chicken just celery and onions.  I call the restaurant and complained and they told me that Black Pepper Chicken is mainly celery and onion.  What??#$%^&*().  I will never order food from any Panda Express ever again.  That's what I get for ordering from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"My go to for on the run meals. From the moment I walked in I was greeted by smiling faces and a Hi Welcome from the girls behind the food. Very nice and friendly great food."}
{"text":"When you go in and they're already out of everything and they tell you it's going to be 6 to 7 minutes for the item you ordering which it is acceptable and then you wait 10 minutes and the lady comes up and goes all about six or seven minutes for your item all over again you're not doing your job right"}
{"text":"The food was ok for panda but the staff was a cluster. Got Terriaki chicken but no sauc e really."}
{"text":"Would have given them a 0 star if I could. They had their open signs lit up and when I walked in to get food they rejected me even though all the food was still out. Terrible customer service this is the worst place ever."}
{"text":"Not so nice customer service, food was just ... ok. Will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Food is great and reasonably priced it only cost me 12 bucks to get a large meal+ large drink (3 chickens and white rice) definitely recommend only downside is they run out of the chicken pretty quick because it's very busy but still are pretty quick"}
{"text":"I'd hate to break the chain of good reviews but I just feel like ranting a bit about my experience. Food is always good at Panda Express but at this location, customer service sucked. So slow and they seemed to be dreading their job. We walked in and they exchanged looks. They kind of acknowledged our presence but it took them a while to come towards us to place our order. Didn't even get a greeting. The lady at the cashier was rude and turned out to be the \"manager for now\". We asked for her for a plate and she said \"ask him.\" (Other slow server) When we got the plate, it had a hard-to-miss green piece of food all up on it's dirty looking self. We were going to eat there but at that point we were so upset that we took our food home."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love that they have a drive-thru, it makes things way more convienent.  Other than that, it's a pretty standard Panda."}
{"text":"Weird how this Panda Express is all by itself.  The only thing next to it is an Office Max. It seems lonely.  Inside it's practically brand new.  The people who work here are real Asians and I had a hard time understanding them (Think South Park and the City Wok).  Maybe it was because I was in a good mood, but I enjoyed the view from my high table.  There was a small grassy area and green trees (see attached pic).  Not too bad for a Panda Exrpess.  Most of them are in malls and are cramped with bodies coming in and out.  This one is nice and quiet.  Kind of relaxing.  Food is the same as any other Panda."}
{"text":"It's a pretty standard Panda Express- cheap pre-made Chinese food with a few different choices.  This one has always had good service, been prompt and never had a problem finding a place to sit.  They are also clean inside.  Good Panda."}
{"text":"I love the terriyaki chicken.  However, the Bejing beef was chewy and over done and I couldn't finish it.  I'm hoping it was a fluke and I'm sure I'll back to a Panda at some point."}
{"text":"It's Panda. You really have to mess it up bad to get a bad review here. The staff were very friendly. They even made me fresh veggies.    The food is typical Panda Express. It's good and  it offensive. I will be back again when I need my next fix."}
{"text":"I really love this location! I always go here when I want Panda Express the staff is extremely helpful!"}
{"text":"We catered from here for 50 people. The service and staff were exceptional! Everyone enjoyed there their meal! Will definitely cater from here again!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Panda Express in a long time. I'm giving 5 stars because of the customer service here especially with Alejandro. He greets customers with a smile as every staff there should. The food tastes all the same in every Panda Express, however with great customer service it will go a long way especially with returning customers."}
{"text":"This is a very clean Panda Express. The employees were so nice and offered us to sample everything. All the food was fresh. The veggies are all fresh and they chop up everything there.  I was incredibly impressed."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I like Panda Express in any state I go.But this one is not good.. First I went to the bathroom and there are no paper towels, so I ask the workers there and they said they run out of paper towels! Wow!.. Second, when I ordered the steam vegetables, they are not freshly cooked and they didn't even ask me if I want them to cook one as what they usually do on other Panama express stores.."}
{"text":"I have never been so upset with a Panda Express. I walked out of here so angry ! First they didn't have anything cooked so we had to wait for 5 mins while they made things. Then when that was done they had 3 people cut in front of us. I should not wait 10 extra minutes because you choose to help the people behind me . Then I hear someone say there food was cold with waiting so long that I had to just leave out of line. Unprofessional, unorganized and cold food. No thank you. If you can't handle it being busy then train your staff again."}
{"text":"This fucking place. It's been 3 different times I've taken an order home to find out it was the wrong order. They don't put fortune cookies in to go orders (essential), they forget sauce, mess orders up, and the kid who they put on drive through is either slow, or just doesn't care about his job. Dude reads back the order with everything wrong! I'm like bro? No, I didn't order broccoli beef, I clearly said orange chicken. Go smoke another blunt before your shift next time why don't you. It's just frustrating because panda has potential, but it's like every location hires incompetent workers."}
{"text":"Went to panda express tonight to find myself waiting 5 minutes for orange chicken, that's fine its 845 on a Friday it's busy I get it. So about 5 cars plus myself are outside waiting. The lady (manager I'm assuming) brings me my food and drops it off and walks away (also hitting my mirror with her shoulder but no need to say sorry I guess) I look in my bad to make sure my order is corrects and I find out in missing to eggrolls. I see her outside so I honk so I could get her attention to let her Know I was missing them. She says in the rudest way ever \"did you pay for them\" I say I'm not sure I told the lady twice I wanted them. I showed her my receipt and again very rude she says \"you didn't pay for them\" now paying is not the issue although I didn't come for attitude after a long  of work myself. She says she day will being me out some but at that point I could tell I was inconvenient to her so I decided I wouldn't trouble her. Never have had a horrible experience until now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing they have great service and I always feel welcomed when I walk in, I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I sit, at the student union, writing this with a plate, still full of food, from Panda Express, beside me. Eff me for thinking that despite the fact I hate Panda Express, that it could  be good this time. After having a severe hankering for kim chi, and NO kim chi anywhere near this campus, I was relegated to Panda for food.   My stomach is severely cramping and I feel like I'm going to vomit. I'm counting down the hours until I can finally get the heck out of here.   Any food that makes you nauseous automatically gets no higher marks than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Usually the food here is good, but today our orders of fried rice and teriyaki chicken all had that nasty burned taste. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Usually ok. Pretty messy. Tables are usually trashed. Tonight was exceptionally bad. Took about ten minutes to get through the line then another 7-8 minutes to wait for the chow mein to finish cooking.   Staff looks very unhappy and not very friendly. Could be the rush?   I'm not expecting too much. Food is consistent and fairly che"}
{"text":"Last week while on vacation, we grabbed a quick Chinese take out meal at this Panda Express location and brought it back to our hotel room.  We got three main entrees and sides, and I was so disappointed with the meal that I had to post a review.  I was a couple bites in when I got a hair in string bean chicken.  Now, normally I'm one to ignore a hair, tell myself that it was my own, and keep eating.  However, a couple bites later I got another hair in the orange chicken!  I stopped eating then, and we put everything in the fridge. The next day I was incredible hungry and decided to take one more bite of the string bean chicken and, sure enough, MORE HAIR!  I don't know if the cook that night wasn't wearing a hair net, I really didn't look, but I was completely disgusted! It has ruined Panda Express for me, and I don't think I can even bring myself to eat it at home."}
{"text":"Must give kudos to the management here for hiring efficient employees. Went on a busy Friday night and, though the line was nearly out the door, it moved very quick and no one felt rushed. Samples were still offered, and everyone was smiling. The food was being replenished at a fast enough pace that there wasn't much being waiting on, too, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I loved eat at this panda express, lovely personal, and also the food I will comeback for sure.Than u panda!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for spring rolls. They  were pretty good. The wrap was crispy not chewy like others I've had. The sweet and sour sauce was average. I did have some fried rice which was not the greatest. It was undercooked and chewy. I will go here if I want the spring rolls and will skip the rice."}
{"text":"Panda was crowded but the ladies behind the counter very fast & efficient.Hot & tasty food at a reasonable price.  4 Stars for Panda Express."}
{"text":"Im used to panda expresses loading in on amd having a friendly face. This panda didnt get my order right and they didnt smile. My boyfriend and I asked for brown rice and I got white and my boyfriend got fried. Then going down, they didnt look at us once and just asked for money without even asking if we wanted anything else.  Once i got home I noticed that they didnt even fill the container up fully so most of the container was left empty."}
{"text":"I think Panda Express is a bit overpriced in general, but the food is always fresh and tasty.  I really like the mushroom chicken and the cream cheese rangoon.  Parking at this location is a little tough, it always seems pretty crowded.  But other than that, everything is pretty peachy!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Prices have gone up as portions have gone down. They'll load you up on rice, but the scoops have gotten smaller. Not at all the value they used to be."}
{"text":"Appears that they are changing over their staff. Much friendlier than before. They recently replaced Mandarin Chicken with the better tasting Teriyaki Chicken."}
{"text":"Visited this location on 6/25/2017 at 3:15 pm and the customer service was horrible. The lobby was filthy and employees were extremely dismissive. I waited in a no-existent line to be completely ignored for 3-5 minutes before i decided to leave. This used to be my favorite location however after this experience i will be frequenting other businesses."}
{"text":"Horrible Service, I was asked to pull up to the front because it'd be a 6 minute wait.  After sitting in my car for 17minutes I decided to pull back around through the drive-thru and waited an additional 5 minutes only to find out my food had been ready all along."}
{"text":"This is my updated review   At night the food and service is mediocre at best but the daytime crew with the tall handsome guy is bangin ' !!   The food is so much better in the day time. I love their little Boba bar as well.   Now the manager reached out to me however I never reached back out to this restaurant. I went in again on my own accord since this is my neighborhood and my bank is right there as well.    My kid loves Panda and so does my chef brother.    I haven't been back at night but the day time crew has it going on!    ------1st Review-------- I am so sick of going into this location with these late night employees distributing inedible dry disgusting food and keeping it there because at 10:15 we are closing soon ?   For 1. Noodles were all cabbage and NO NOODLE  2. The meats especially ones fried looked so dried out beyond recognition. 3. He rice too looked dried out and tasteless   They are cleaning the dining area with part of it closed off because we g t it , it's Friday and you want to go home but do you know how I inviting it is to see someone closing off party of their dining section because they want to leave asap ?   It's off putting stop making crappy old food for us to eat in summerlin of all places.   Disgusting one star for zero effort an zero care for what they put out for people to have and to eat"}
{"text":"the chow mein was dry and over cooked the orange chicken tasted like shit I'm a really really picky eater and I love my Panda Express but this shit made me pissed the f*** off learn how to cook or go get another job"}
{"text":"Excellent, prompt & polite service. High quality food & drinks. Very clean place."}
{"text":"The worst location ever for panda orange chicken is so uncooked never again I couldn't even eat it gave it to my dog surprised he even ate it as bad as it was. If I could give negative five stars I would. It was that bad."}
{"text":"Tip to all the Panda Express managers. Tell the cook to cook the orange chicken don rush it seems like the busier they are the worse the orange chicken is never cooked enough always chewy and the Bigger the pieces the less cooked they are then you ask the server to try and get the little pieces and they look at you like is stupid I like my chicken cooked no chewy. COOK THE ORANGE CHICKEN LONGER better to take more time then to make everyone sick because your rushing"}
{"text":"I love this location, the place is always clean, friendly staff, and the food is always hot and very delicious."}
{"text":"Darn it, I should have read the reviews before I go but I went thwre based on high reviews of the US chain. Well I guess I'll say I agree with the previous reviewers and found that the 50% of the dishes were finished or about to be finished. And I thought may be coz I went there on a Saturday evening but now I see that that's not the case. They scraped the pans for our order and the portion was really really small! The 3 entrée plate could hardly be compared to a plate of food that you can get even at a  mall food court:( and it was priced at $9.98 plus tax. the Honey Walnut Shrimps were the only seafood available and you get charged $1.49 extra (loool) The taste wasn't special,  (but maybe coz it came from the slightly warm bottom of a pan) so I was left very dissapointed. Great start of a business people. Usually it starts good and then quality drops, but these guys decided to change that too:)) Ah well, it's just another place I ain't going back to."}
{"text":"We dined inside the restaurant, we watched staff snap green beans with their hands, handle their cell phones, touch their hair, the register and handle money then return to the green beans. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I do not care for Panda Express in Houston, but I must say this location within the airport is delicious and fresh. I ordered a small carte of their beef and broccoli for $4.12 with tax and it did not disappoint. It was so delish my hubbs wanted to order the same after he had disappointment he experienced from the organic market next door."}
{"text":"I'd give them zero stars if I could. Terrible service. They are always out of items. They need apologize or do anything to try to make it right. I will never come to this location again. Ever."}
{"text":"Tried This Panda Express a week ago for the first time and I have to say I will definitely be back. Great food. Friendly people and seemed clean. I tried the shrimp  and noodles and I fell in love! So I will be back. But it set the bar for any other Panda Express that I may try in the future! Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I absolutely LOVE Panda Express. I make it a point to eat there at least once a week. This stuff is my DRUG.   This location is usually pretty quick as far as getting the line under control and getting people through and seated. HOWEVER. The meats are usually somewhat dry/don't have enough sauce, and sometimes the food is old. I had a chicken egg roll yesterday, and it was kind of chewy. You know, like, it seemed like it had been sitting there all day.  Overall it's a good location if you're in a pinch but I usually go to higley and elliot or signal butte and baseline, especially the higley location. Their food is always fresh and ready to go, plus they have a drive through."}
{"text":"This panda express is OK as with all fast food at places it's fast and it's cheap. I am still disappointed they don't have sweet-and-sour pork. Had to wait for one item to be cooked."}
{"text":"This local restaurant serves your food buffet style so you don't have to wait to eat. I  sampled the Golden Treasure Shrimp and it's a good thing I did.   It was overcooked so I ended up with orange chicken and fried rice. It was nothing special. I will say the spring and egg rolls looked tasty but I did not bite.  Nothing else looked appetizing.   Perhaps this is because it was after the lunch hour (2 PM) and the food may have been sitting for a while...I don't know.  In any case, I will not be back to visit this establishment."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for Panda Express, $1 more than what we usually pay. It's Vegas. I would have it again, it's cheap (compare to others restaurant on the strip) and not bad quality at all."}
{"text":"This is not about the food,  which is great.  This is about an absolute failure in customer service.    Placed an online order and paid on line, with pick up for 6:45. Arrived at 6:30 asked found drive thru closed,  so I parked.  Walked in and was 14th in line!! Only one person taking/making orders; one person cooking; one person cleaning tables; and one cashing out and helping.  After waiting in line for 20 minutes got to counter and said picking up a paid online order.  A new person who came to work,  checked and said they need to make the two plates!  Then when he started,  told him they were wrong.  Said the order was two bowls,  not plates. He then went to a different location and found the right order.  So now the order was being made.  Finally the order was completed,  35 minutes after I stepped in to the location.   Brought this to the attention of the person catching me out,  and was told,  \"Oh, you could have just come to the register to get your order.\" I said where is that known to the customers?  She apologized, but too late in my book.    Food is good for sure,  but terrible staffing preparation for a Friday evening!"}
{"text":"Ordered meal ahead of time online. The ordering experience through their \"app\" deserves a 1 star of it's own but that beef is with corporate, not this franchise. Ordered with an estimated pickup time of 7:15; food wasn't ready until about 7:20, no big deal though. I asked for soy sauce, chili sauce, and the teriyaki sauce on the side. The person who helped me even asked if I wanted some (although I had asked online for some), when I replied yes another worker informed the person helping me that they had already put some in the bag. Awesome. I got out of there and headed home to find that not only had they not included teriyaki sauce for my grilled teriyaki chicken (it's almost like it's in the name), but the soy sauce and chili sauce that had been put in there had not been. The chicken doesn't seem very fresh on top of this but at least the potstickers were. I don't expect the red carpet to be thrown down for me, but I feel like getting the order the way you ordered it is one of the most basic necessities for a fast food order. Lesson learned, next time check the order like I would at a McDonald's."}
{"text":"This is my worst Panda Express. I'm not eating at another one. First of all the meat is pre-frozen except for the noodles and rice. They don't even try to hide the frozen orange chicken packs sitting on the counters in the back. So, fresh vegetables cooked with frozen meat. Ugh!!  Also, charging $9+ for a spoonful of food is outrageous. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Thanks for giving me two pieces of shrimp and three pieces of orange chicken. I just LOVE spending extra for less! Also, this evening I had to wait until I got home to eat. No utensils or napkins! My order was missing the cream cheese puffs. To top off the worst experience is that I didn't even get my damn fortune cookie."}
{"text":"I've been to bad Panda Expresses and good ones. This one, based on my two visits here, is among my top 2 favorite ones. Servers are friendly, one server was wiping his counter after filling each order, and one server even went around offering extra sauce, etc. to the diners, even though it was a busy time. The server made sure to put in a good proportion of beef in my Broccoli Beef. The meat was sliced thin and was tender. Service was fast enough, given the crowd. I did not realize until later that this location also has a drive-thru!  October 7, 2016 Marlene at the drive-through was exceptionally kind and friendly, yet professional. She asked if I wanted egg rolls, which I wasn't going to order, but this time am glad she prompted me to order them. Everything was yummy. I had not been to a Panda Express lately because it seemed the chicken did not seem to be natural anymore; it had been tough and just did not taste fresh. This time, the chicken was tender and fresh."}
{"text":"Food was quite good but the place was dirty and they serve Pepsi instead of Coke. Another corporate sellout trying to save money."}
{"text":"This Panda Express is just down the road from my work, so it makes for a fast lunch.  This location can get a little busy but I've never had to wait for too long to be helped.  I usually get the bowl with steamed veggies and orange chicken or teriyaki chicken. The veggies are always fresh and have a satisfying crunch when bitten into.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving a big box fast food a 4 Star review but I have to admit the food was fresh and very tasty. The staff was friendly and restaurant clean.  The parking lot is small and tight so if it's crowded I could see that being a headache but overall it was a good and tasty experience for grabbing a quick bite before hitting the road."}
{"text":"This location is the closest to my house and I probably eat here like once a week.  I don't know why the rating is so low as it is one of the best panda's I've ate at.  The food is always fresh and the service is friendly and fast.   Went here on Monday 10-5-15 through the drive thru.  I got a two-entree plate with half rice, half chow mein, kung pao chicken, and orange chicken, and a small mushroom chicken for my boy.  The total was $8.97.   I usually get the same thing but sometimes I'll branch out and get the honey walnut chicken or some fried shrimp or cream cheese wontons.    Never say no to Panda."}
{"text":"I love this Panda Express location. Their food is always great quality and great tasting. They have he best customer service. All their employees are always smiling and so professional and attentive to their customers. I'm always coming here and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had, rice was terrible. I threw it in the garbage. Don't waste you money"}
{"text":"I don't know how ANY restaurant stays in business these days, especially fast food. First off, who would want to work for low wages and serve such fussy customers?  Most of the time I wait in line because customers don't know what they want and don't care about the people waiting in line behind them. Many in line have a laundry list of items for their family, so yes, it's going to take more time. I've seen one guy order chow mein for his 2 or 3 orders, then just before paying ask for half chow mein and half fried rice! Then they have to disrupt the whole line for his request! I think the customer pulled a trick just to get more food on his order. That's low.  Anyway, I wouldn't want to be the manager of this place. I keep going because the food quality is still consistent. Also, despite being busy, they still take time to switch out their serving utensils with clean ones. Yes, I saw them do it. It's true that the place could be kept more clean, but at least they're trying.  So, I'll keep getting food here, just like all the people in line before me..."}
{"text":"Great customer service from the manager on duty yesterday! I ordered two meals through UberEATS and only one had arrived, of course it wasn't mine so I was hangry when I called them! The manager I spoke with fixed the issue so quickly and within 25 minutes I was eating my favorite Kung pao chicken! I appreciate good service like that because it really stands out from most places today who don't really care and tell you oh we will fix it next time because this time you're apparently supposed to starve. Thank you for great service and helping me get my fried rice and spicy chicken fix"}
{"text":"Orange chicken is the way to go. They have a variety of meats (steak, chicken, shrimp). Different rices or chow mein available. If you haven't been to a Panda Express before, you order from the line and they serve in front of you. Ask for a sample if they don't offer one!  The parking lot is large enough and the location is near a light on South Blvd which makes it easier to turn left. Overall a good value for what you get and pretty consistent quality"}
{"text":"What's up with this place? I asked for a two item meal and I specifically asked for a fork because last time I did not get a fork. I got a plate with hardly any chicken in it whatsoever and they purposely didn't put a fork in there again.  What a joke! Whoever does the hiring here should be fired."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at panda on my lunch break.  I ordered the new shrimp and steak bowl.  I got one shrimp and no steak only veggies and rice.. I tried to call they hung up on me several times.."}
{"text":"This location needs quality control - if you order a kids teriyaki chicken they give your kid all the burnt chicken! This has happened twice now and our food was given to us with food falling out of the containers - just because it's fast food doesn't mean you want sloppy food or service!  Won't be going to this location again!"}
{"text":"I have very little faith in chain restaurants.  Panda Express lunch was really bad. Noodles - overcooked, choppy, wasted, flavorless.  I chose a \"Grilled Chicken\" which was 70% chicken fat bits with a few pieces of some kind of breast or muscle like tissue.    Grilled steak something with some vegetable was leather.  Its just not good. Fact is there ain't nothing good to eat in 85027 unfortunately."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a Chinese restaurant so close to the residential areas in Chandler.  However, this particular location does not ever have anything for vegetarians.  I've been consistently disappointed and would rather drive to a \"real\" Chinese place a few miles away."}
{"text":"Virtually every Panda Express I been to has had good tasting , fast food for a reasonable price. Today we went to this one in Baseline and were pleasantly surprised. We were there with our friends ( first timers :) ) .....the food was good as usual but the portions were HUGE, my wife and I had the chicken teriyaki and I think we each had close to a quarter pound of breast chicken, very nice and filling. They will be seeing me again :)"}
{"text":"This particular Panda Express is so gross....I mean, it's clean.  However, something is not quite right about the food they serve at this one.  Or maybe I just stopped eating Panda Express or it's always been this way and I've been spoiled with delicious Chinese food in SF.  It's not fair for me to compare Panda with that, but c'mon!  Why does this place charge so much, but provide such low quality food?"}
{"text":"Food was cold and old and now smaller portions, ran out of 3 main dishes and tea, terrible customer service. No fortune cookie given. Asked to talk to a manager and was told No one is available need to call tomorrow. Will not be returing to this location. Very disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"We walked in the other day because we haven't had Panda in years. There was literally only one other person there. Ordered the 3 entree one side deal with half fried rice and chow mein with pepper chicken, orange chicken, and honey walnut shrimp. The honey walnut shrimp was $1.50 extra, I didn't really want to pay extra but this was my favorite several years ago and wanted to try it again. It was a substantial amount of food for $10 and then we got 2 veggie spring rolls at $2.   We got home to find the chow mein was extremely dry, I definitely recommend staying away from the chow mein here. The rice was meh as was the honey walnut shrimp and orange chicken. I actually like the pepper chicken, one of the lighter options at Panda. Had a nice kick, just wished they used better chicken pieces. The rolls were extremely mushy and bland, also stay away from these.   We probably won't be back again, we just wanted to give it a whirl for nostalgia related purposes."}
{"text":"I love panda but this place sucks.  There is barely any sauce on the chow mein, they didn't cook the onions through and said they never do.  They added extra chilies to the spicier foods and that burned going down.   Not going back!   I think they are confused about whether it is a chinese or mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here often.  The sweet fire chicken is never fresh. You have to ask them to cook it fresh. I asked Osbaldo, could they cook it fresh, he said yes, and then proceeded to give me old chicken. They only cooked it fresh after I demanded my money back. If you can't cook items fresh, say no. Don't  deliberately give people something they don't want just because it's the drive thru and you expect them to not check their food. This is the only panda  I have trouble getting them to cook items fresh."}
{"text":"Gave me the wrong order went back they were very rude. I ask for the manager and he just ignored us. This is the second bad experience we've had with them!!! Managers name is Alex!! and casher Bernice  C!!"}
{"text":"They need to make sure they have adequate help when there is a line and give accurate time quotes as to how long it takes before something will be out.  I was just told 4-5 minutes for my item,  but didn't end up receiving it until over 10 minutes later when the other person in my party was almost done with their meal."}
{"text":"This place is awful second time I came in and everything was not ready orange chicken was low I got scraps of that. The only thing that looked OK was the mushroom chicken but every time I've coming to this place they're always low on food they never prepare properly nor keep up with business as far as running low on really popular items like orange chicken you may want to consider the employees you employee or get a better team in there that knows how to keep up with business. wish I could give it zero stars but one will have to do"}
{"text":"Service was great at Panda Express the staff was very friendly Agustin was super funny and a cool guy! The only reason why I probably wont go to this location is all the pan handlers outside! I do not have any problem with them but the 3 men that asked me for money were so mean! lol First guy that asked me for money I told him I did not have any and I was wearing a shirt with a rainbow on it then he started telling me about how God hates gay people! Seriously lol anyway I went inside and ordered and dined in, as we were eating we noticed another man in the restaurant sitting there he looked hungry as he was starring at everyone so we purchased an entree to go for him and he told us because of medication he could not eat, he looked so hungry and thats why I felt bad but was ok we will just have left overs for later! While I was getting in my car a 3rd man approached me asked me for money and I did not have any change so I said here this is a new box of food and he continued to mumble something and said he did not want it! geez! I know this is not Pandas fault but I think they can do a better job in keeping these men away!"}
{"text":"They always run out of food and the food that does remain is dry or not well made. For example... The orange chicken is dry, chow mein is discolored and had no flavor, the sweet fire chicken was sweet and had no spice. This is maybe my 3rd or 4th visit here and they always have problems. The only reason I gave this location two stars instead of one is because the ladies were nice. Don't come here, go to different location!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, quick and tasty! There was a line but it moved quick. They acknowledge this is Americanized Chinese food. The ordering is like other fast casual restaurants. Wait in line, looking at the food options and select what you want. They fill your bowl or plate for you. There's a dining area with ample seating. It's a brand new building on Center Ridge one block West of Westgate."}
{"text":"The dining room is always dirty. We always have to wait for one of the entrees. And when I get orange chicken more than half is not edible. This is the worst Panda Express I've ever gone to. I will make the extra drive to go to another location where the staff actually care about the place."}
{"text":"I live in Vegas and I have been to a number of Panda Express Restaurants and all have served very good food.  I like my food steaming hot and in particular this Panda Express off Silverado is the greatest.  I especially love their iced tea.  Too bad :( they do not have a drive up, but that's ok.  It's worth getting out of the car even to take home THE TAKE OUT."}
{"text":"Wow this place just keeps getting worse.  This afternoon they were out of several items and I watched a cook throw a fit because he was asked to do his job!!"}
{"text":"The one we grab a quick and tasty takeout is on Cactus/75th Ave. Generally prefer not to sit in because we're usually in a rush. The service is always quick and courteous if you know what you want, which we do. Food is also pretty tasty and the portions are adequate. Generally speaking I prefer to eat in an authentic Chinese buffet or restaurant, but when we're in a rush it'll do just fine. Lee Lee's is in the same complex and we get stuff there to add in to Panda's offerings. Like to be creative when it comes to food whether I'm fixing or bagging."}
{"text":"I love this Panda Express! It's always clean, the food is always warm and fresh, and the staff are really friendly. Every time I go in, it's consistent. I am a big fan of low carb, so I get steamed veggies and teriyaki chicken. Skip the sauce! We're here all the time, and we are never disappointed. I think it's the nicest Panda Express we've ever been to."}
{"text":"I usually don't like Panda Express because their food is over cooked and drenched in brown sauces.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this Panda Express, especially it's inside the airport (you know how airport food is generally overly priced and horrible).  They cook in small batches so they may run out of items quickly but the trade off is food is very fresh.  This place also doesn't  over cook or over drench their food, which is a plus for me as I don't like soft veggies or soggy food."}
{"text":"First, we usually enjoy Panda Express: and over the last few years, have eaten at MANY different locations in both Las Vegas and other cities. We understand that the POOR experience we had here is because of ignorant franchise owners at a single location and not a reflection on Panda Express in general. Nevertheless, we learned the hard way not all Pandas are created equal!  UGHHHH. Unfortunately, we made the mistake of trying this Panda Express because it was very close to the doctor's office where my 94 year old Mom had an appointment.  It was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon...well after lunchtime and before dinner. There was nobody eating there, but EVERY table was DIRTY with crumbs, noodles, spilled soda, etc.It was disgusting. We couldn't find ONE clean table to sit at. I went up to the food line to ask someone if they could wipe down a table and was ignored for at least a good 2-3 minutes by the manager and three members of the cooking staff who seemed to be very busy talking at top volume in Spanish. Finally, a woman with a name tag that said \"Manager\" came up to me thinking I was ordering food and barked, \"What do you want?\" I answered, \"We'd like a clean table to sit, can you wipe off a table for us?\" She seemed annoyed, \"Give me a minute.\" FIVE more minutes passed as she proceeded to leave us standing and waiting (a 94 year old woman on a walker) as her loud conversation and laughing with employees continued.  I had to ask her one MORE time AGAIN if we could please have a clean table . Finally she begrudgingly came over with a wet wash rag to wipe. I asked her if she was the manager to which she replied in a challenging tone, \"No, I am the assistant, why?\" I said, \"Because all the tables in your restaurant are dirty. Don't you think you might have more business if you didn't have to leave customers standing and waiting several minutes to sit at a clean table?\"   Oh, she didn't LIKE that. She gave me the stink eye and walked away. We should have just LEFT at that point, but unfortunately didn't. After wiping ONE table for us, she retreated back behind the food line and continued blabbering away with employees in Spanish, apparently comfortable to continue leaving all the other tables in the restaurant dirty.  When we finally went to order, half of the selection trays looked almost empty and dried out. They acted annoyed that some of our order choices required them to cook fresh. My mom only wanted a water to drink, so we got her a water cup. The second time the caregiver took my mom's water cup over to the drink bar for a refill, she put ice tea in it. The \"Manager\" noticed right away and came over scolding her,\" Those cups are for water only, you'll need to pay for that tea!\"  Yeah,they can leave customers standing around and waiting ten munites before they can be bothered to come and wipe down a dirty table, but a 94 year old woman drinking a tea she didn't pay for...IMMEDIATE response. SCREW you, Panda Express! BOO HISS!   BTW...we paid them the $1.72 they demanded for my mom's tea.  The last part of our negative experience here actually happened while we were eating. We started to slowly become aware of the odor of sour mop and garbage. The longer we stayed, the more noticeable it became. Determined it was coming from BOTH of the inside garbage cans in the restaurant which were filled to the brim (No customers in the place, but too busy to wipe off tables and empty the trash). We can only conclude that from the smell, when they DO empty the trash, they don't bother to clean or sanitize the liner pails. GROSS!  I CAN report that none of us experienced any sickness or food poisoning as a result of our meal here. When we left, that was a concern in the back of my mind. If you are considering eating at Panda Express, you will be much more pleased to drive five more minutes to the location at Durango and 215. That Panda Express knows what they are doing. They have consistently fresh food, a clean and pleasant interior, and really friendly employees that really care about your meal."}
{"text":"Came to get favorite meal but told out of Chow Mein. Advised it would be an hour or hour and a half before more arrived. Left without food and went to nearby Wongs Jr"}
{"text":"Old food. They don't fill up your plate like other locations. Also BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible at this location. It doesnt matter the time of day the drive thru is always backed up. And if your order is wrong...good luck getting it corrected without attitude. Inside isnt any better. And if an item is out let the customer know when ordering."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this Panda Express location! We ordered the special, 3 large entrees and 2 large side dishes. Angus beef w/ vegetables, Walnut Shrimp w/sweet sauce & fried pork w/vegetables! Everything was delicious!  Definitely would recommend this location! Also, ordered 2 orders of pan fried dumplings which also were delicious! Well, was very disappointed with second time at this location! The dishes we ordered were truly so oily that really could not taste the food. The chow mein/oily, the angus beef & shrimp dish was very chewy & only got 1 shrimp.  Did not order their wontons because for 1 wonton cost almost $2.00! Maybe just a bad day for the cook and would recommend to call to place order and ask them to use less oil!  But, will try again because like I wrote, maybe just a off day?"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend, the line was short, the place was clean, and they had everything hot and fresh.  The employees were nice, but didn't say much.  You must ask for chili paste and soy or they won't give it to you."}
{"text":"It's edible, I guess. The post-1:00 lunch rush is a disaster. Out of several entrees, sauces, there are over half a dozen online / phone orders stacking up, and a cluster of people just waiting for those missing items. Expect pretty cold food by the time I actually get my order."}
{"text":"I sometimes crave fast chinese food & This Panada Express was my go to because it's clean but today I ordered Family Size with 3 Lg Entree & 2 Lg sides but found a hard plastic in the chow mein. Not sure what to say...almost swallowed but caught in my throat luckily."}
{"text":"I normally don't give bad reviews after only one visit to a location but this was unacceptable... first of all, it was 7pm on a Friday, and have the entrée were old and/or running low... we waited 15 minutes after paying for them to complete our order. When I opened my to-go container and began eating,  the first thing I noticed was that the quantities were much smaller than normal...'next I noticed  my vegetables were undercooked and most likely expired.  The beef was chewy.    Bottom line... don't go to this Panda Express. There's many others within a few miles."}
{"text":"Restaurant review If you want freshly prepared Chinese food that's made in a clean restaurant than panda express is the way to go. I've been here a couple of times and over all I have not been this disappointed. Staff is friendly and they greet you as soon as you walk in through the door. My go to entrées are the orange chicken and the broccoli and beef. The food is made rather fresh and you can see the chefs cooking behind the glass. My most recent visit the orange chicken was a little off I think they put too much vinegar in the sauce.  Pros: Fresh Chinese food, large portions, ample parking  Cons: Still a lot of cholesterol  Hidden deals: Call in for the survey with each of your receipts in order to get an additional side with your next order  Health code rating: A. I watch them clean the cooking area when it got dirty http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1239"}
{"text":"Customer service very nice, was waited on promptly, and the food has flavor to it, unlike many others Panda Express I purchased food at. I will definitely come back here whenever I want some Panda Express ."}
{"text":"I decided to stop here today for lunch.  I didn't feel like going side anywhere.  I just needed something quick that wasn't between a bun.  The service was quick and my food was fresh.  The orange chicken was crisp vs soggy.  They also give military discounts as well."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this Panda Express location really sucks. I've given it a shot a few different times and each time something is wonky about my order. It's either extremely dry, they got the order wrong, or it's super oily. Went again today and the proof is in the pudding... today my order was completely burnt. In fact I am shocked that they would even sell the food. I've attached some pictures to show you. Avoid this location if you can."}
{"text":"My husband stopped on the way home from work to order dinner. I was on the phone with him when he placed our order.  When he got home and we opened the containers it was all wrong!  Not only were the entrees wrong, but the Rangoons we ordered were not even there, also our pot stickers were missing one.  Funny thing about the pot stickers is they made him wait as they said they were making fresh.  So I had to get in my car drive all the way back so I could get a refund because at this point I wanted nothing from them.  Every time we come here it is an issue Either they forget to put an item in the bag, or they give us the wrong item.   The last visit i went to check my bag and was given attitude by the attendant because I was holding up the line. She snapped \"everything is in the bag you can move forward\" funny thing my potstickers were missing when I got home so I guess attitudy judy was wrong.   I won't be visiting this location ever again."}
{"text":"Good food as always! But in this location the quantity of food is just ridiculous! $1.25 more for a honey walnut shrimp, they gave us 5pcs of shrimp!!! The server even want to remove another shrimp from the plate. lol avoid this place if you can!"}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague. All these overfried overcooked \"Chinese\" food, or let's say Americanized Chinese food, sit here for hours and hours. Fashion Square has become an enormous shopping mall, and they're still expanding it. It's ALWAYS packed with people, I swear, every day pretty much at anytime during the day. And Black Friday is still yet to come... Did you know there are airborne diseases spread through sneezing, coughing or just TALKING???? Just imagine if someone is infected with some pathogens and that goes into your apparently \"delicious\" meal.....eeeeewwwww!!!! And yes, when food is exposed to air for so long, there are more chances that might happen.  No thanks! I'm not a big fan of fast food chains and I think this is one of the worsts. I don't know what I was thinking the other day, I got some rice and then I got a stomachache afterwards. Good thing I'm vaccinated. Here's my real advice: get a flu shot, TB, meningitis vaccine before approaching a Panda Express! And please, there are plenty of other places that prepare your food upon order and follow better hygiene protocols."}
{"text":"The food is good, have eaten here before, service is good, never had a problem,  then why 1 star you ask, here is why.   It is Saturday Aug 2nd at 4:30pm and I am literally watching two employees argue at the register about how to do ones job.  The lady in green is going off on the cashier in red, why do I need to see or ESPECIALLY hear any of his.  Where is the manager.......that is why 1 star!!!!  Stupid!!!!   One in green needs to be reprimanded!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this Panda Express (or any other one) in a long time, thought I would give it a  try.  Got the mushroom chicken and honey-walnut shrimp.  For $1.25 extra, the honey-walnut shrimp should be pretty darn good, it was just ok.  Like the rest of the meal (and what other reviews have said), ok place to stop by if you are hungry but not for really good food."}
{"text":"This location is clean and new, but I found the staff unhelpful and the options lacking. As a vegetarian I was very disappointed to find that none of the entrees are vegetarian (I've had eggplant tofu or country style bean curd at other locations). My only options were chow mein, rice, steamed veggies, egg rolls and cream cheese wantons. Even a single vegetarian option would be great!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here today for some dinner; I honestly have always wanted to try Panda Express after all of the hype and photos that I see on social media... so I'm glad that I finally got the chance!  I got two entrees and one side: chicken breast with string beans, orange chicken, and chow mein as my side. They give you pretty hefty portions and I think I was lucky and got all my food fresh since they just happened to replace the food. However, it was all super delicious!! The chow mein seemed to be a little dry but it was still flavorful and good. The orange chicken was my fave! Not too sweet and the chicken were fried well and not hard/tough to eat. The chicken breast with broccoli was good, not the best but the string beans were delicious.  I also got an egg roll and it was good but I probably wouldn't order it again. Fried well and flavors were good. My friends said that they stopped by near closing time during their last visit and that the quality of food during this visit was significantly better than that time. So I would recommend not coming towards closing if you want old food.  Service was good, everyone was really polite and the process was fast and efficient! I hope to stop by again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, shouldn't you have food ready for the dinner rush?  We came in at 5p and had to wait for everything. There seemed to be plenty of staff so not sure what they were doing leading up to the dinner hour...but it certainly wasn't preparing appropriately for the dinner hour."}
{"text":"We frequent this location but the challenge with take out is usually the same.  You ask if they have included something specific (for example) fortune cookies, and they assure you they have. As you feel around the bag, sure enough they are there...under all the food!  Then when you get home you find out they didn't give you enough. If you order 4 entrees you should get 4 cookies. Seems simple enough. And it's not the biggest deal...until your kids find out they don't all get a cookie.  Seriously, this is not a hard thing to do. You want to WOW your customers if you want them to return. Not only return but recommend your location to others.   We will go back. But next time I'm going to be the annoying customer who stands in the check out line and unpacks my bag on the counter before I even consider leaving the building."}
{"text":"We have been here a bunch of times and they are always very friendly here. Not sure if they still have it but if you went in before they closed they would reduce the prices which we thought was a good deal. It just seemed like in the past year the quality of the food has gone down and depending on who was working the amount of food you got as well, We look for consistency and it is not here at all. Sometimes the chicken just tasted like it sat too long. The past time we went we didn't feel so well after we both ate the food. So we are not fans of this place anymore.  it actually made us not want to eat at one again there are so many other Chinese places that you can sit down and have it made fresh and it is much better than a fast food chain like this."}
{"text":"Just a disappointment.  I have tried this location three times and it just gets worse each time.  Food not prepared, lines backed up, trying to close and clean early.  See my photos for the stack of containers waiting for food.  See photo of my horrible looking food.  Do yourself a favor and patronize the Downtown Summerlin location for a better experience."}
{"text":"Came to order to go and it was 30 min to close and they did not have any fried rice so I asked if they could make some and they said no, the girl that was upfront was very rude (Kim). I never had this issue before at any other panda. Will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I've ate at many pandas before and this was the worst. The chicken pieces were stuck together while cooked and raw. So gross...."}
{"text":"Terrible--to be honest if the mixed smells don't scare you away the obvious addition of food coloring into everything breaded should.  I've eaten here three times and every time I've been violently sick, off two chicken dishes and one pork.  Any hole in the wall Chinese restaurant is better then this!"}
{"text":"THIRD time we have gone through and gotten EMPTY containers - seriously.  Paid $20 for a meal that wasn't in the containers when we got home.  Will not be going here again, or any Panda for that matter."}
{"text":"Best place to go for a quick, affordable freshly made meal in front of you.  You are always offered free samples of any item before purchase.  That does not happen in other food establishments.  Thanks to Melissa, who I think is the manager, she is always happy friendly, I like to see employees eating at the place they work.  That tells me that the place is super clean, beyond what we see, the food is just as tasty to the employee.  Thats Melissa and your staff for your great attitude and delivery each time of good affordable fresh food. The best part is that if you do the survey on your receipt, you get a FREE entree!  Cant beat the great deal here.  I do agree that the meat portions seem to be shrinking, I have to search through all the onions to find it....I am sure the employees hate enforcing that new rule."}
{"text":"Me and my family used to frequently go to the surprise location for lunch, but the past few months have been disappointing. Every time we go it's very hot, the employees looked miserable and super sweaty. We asked about the air conditioning today Tuesday 9-6-2017 they told us the management doesn't care about the customers and don't service the ac like they should and that even though there are complaints they fall on deaf ears.   When it's just as hot inside as it is outside and the employees and cooks are sweating INTO THE FOOD, then the issue needs to be addressed.   We did not stay to eat today, we went to del Taco where the management is amazing and care about the customers."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star that's what I would rate.  I've never experienced such poor customer service in my life.  The smugness and attitude of the employees  was deplorable.   Customer service is everything, especially in this town.   Apparently that's not top priority."}
{"text":"Food Availability: For some reason we arrive between 5pm-7pm, their popular Honey Walnut or regular fried rice always seems to be out. I guess we just arrive after busy hours or early diners? I'm not sure but some food choices are less then a scoop empty (majority are full depending on demand) and some ppl must wait until a fresh batch is made depending upon demand.   Been here a couple times since its on the way home from work. I go here with a coworker during dinner time between 5pm - 7pm depending what time we arrive.  Pretty much slow with a few guests, and it's a quiet and settling atmosphere. We always seem to be served by the same person, a guy named Luis. He was very courteous and responsive to our food decisions.  Overall, good place for a quick dinner. A star for convenience and 2 stars for Luis, his customer service skills is what keeps this place from having a lackluster dining experience."}
{"text":"I know this place isn't authentic, but the Orange Chicken is pretty darn good. Also, the staff here is friendly and the location is clean. I don't love the prices, but it's fast and convenient. They also have this Peach Green Tea that is freakin' tasty. I think I refilled my cup like 3 times."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened in Century 3. Upon research, I seen they had bubble tea. Me and my daughter could NOT wait to go. We get there and it was just like a Chipotle set-up which was fine, so much looked so good it was hard to decide what to get so we got the three portion meal.   The food was good, but there WAS NO BUBBLE TEA. It was just like a regular Americanized Asian food place. It was not too bad, but nothing special like we had hoped. We still have to travel really far into the city with terrible traffic and awful parking to get Asian food that is 4-5 stars.  I really don't have much else to say about this place to really write any more about it.   It's kinda good. That's about it."}
{"text":"I ordered my food nothing difficult. 2 3 entrees. The girl totally mixed up the entrees. I corrected her and she started to put the wrong food in the wrong container. I corrected her again!!! Paid for my food drive 5 miles home, unpacked my food to find the egg rolls and ragoons were not put in my bag. Drove 5 miles back walked in and the same girl looks at me and says Welcome to Panda!! I said I would like the rest of my order now.  She reboxed my missing food and she said thank you!! No apologies, no offer of a free drink.  If your looking for customer service do your self a favor and drive past this location!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly employees very clean environment. Food tastes good. They wash hands between orders. Great for families l, kids and everyone"}
{"text":"Panda express is always good for a quick little meal on the go between jobs. The food is Hot fresh and the staff on Sahara is friendly. This branch in particular location represents the values of panda express small family restaurant started in 1983 in Pasadena, California."}
{"text":"I love this little panda they do great job and it's always packed. It's very clean and the offer samples. It's a great way to place a stop on the way home for healthy nutritious choice to your ordinary past express pick up Laney is an awesome option and express.com."}
{"text":"I love Panda Express and this location is super close to my house. I eat there at least 2 times a week and I have always had a good experience. Today I didn't want to wait in line so I decided to call and order over the phone and they took my order without any problems, got there 10 minutes later and they had it ready and waiting for me. The staff is Young and energetic, fast service and good portions."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but after all my experiences being bad here I have to. A customer ahead of me started making really racist comments about Chinese people saying the list of meals he was ordering and stated it started to look like Chinese. The employee then encouraged the racist behavior and made a very rude comment about the victims of the Asiana flight downing. He started to joke and replace the names of food items as the names of those who had passed away during that incident. He said \"would you like some sum ting Wong with your holi fuk?\". This was not the first time I experienced distasteful behavior by the employees here. I've also almost always had employees here throw food onto the plate which caused the foods to co-mingle. Kung pao chicken and orange chicken don't mix for future reference. On top of the sloppy service, I've gotten food poisoned every time I've been here and so has the rest of my family. We know it was their food because it was our first and last meal of a very busy day. Don't go here because it's not worth the bad service and food poisoning."}
{"text":"Over 40 minutes until closing, but had the doors locked, employees standing around talking, and no one acknowledging someone outside during OPEN business hours. Inexcusable!"}
{"text":"This location is right around the corner from my house so been my go to location for panda for more than a few years now. Always friendly staff who offer samples right away. Sometimes if a dish is running low they will offer me the fresh one coming up instead of the old stuff that's been sitting there for awhile. Always good service."}
{"text":"They're new so I'm being very forgiving... I think they'll get better with time.  The food is standard but the parking and drive thru traffic set up is horrible."}
{"text":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  It's terrible, they keep me waiting for a popular item they are out of at dinner time, when no one  else was in there. Their drive thru is terrible, they have been making a person wait for more than 15 minutes!  There is no sense of urgency in the workers and they just look confused.  Where is the MANAGEMENT??!!  There is a line of eight orders waiting on main dishes that were not prepared for the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Bon, je ne sais pas trop pourquoi ce Resto a si peu d'étoiles...mon expérience a été agréable! Bon, ok, le Resto en tant que tel est pas super bien décoré et l'ambiance n'est pas tout à casser mais pour le prix (combo sushis pour 2 à 32$) je ne peux aucunement me plaindre!!! D'autant plus que l'on peut apporter son vin! Nous avons mangé des sushis de très bonnes qualité, qui ne sortaient pas de l'ordinaire en terme de créativité mais qui alliaient fraîcheur et goût pour un super bon prix. En prime on nous a donné des bonbons d'halloween:) Dans le quartier il y'a peu de Resto de ce genre, c'est avec plaisir que j'y retournerai!"}
{"text":"great n frendly service..fresh food just coked in front of you what else can you ask . cream cheese ragoons arly good"}
{"text":"nice place fast friendly service 6 o'clock in the afternoon like 20 people in line they're really working team on that place the best way to do it just wish they will keep the food a little more warmer."}
{"text":"The worst service ever received at a Panda Express.  They need to bring in new management who knows what they are doing. Waited in line 30 minutes. The guy in front of me used to be an employee and spent his time in line talking with all the other employees behind the counter. Then the cashier proceeded to count money while there was still a line out the flipping door. The customer service skills in this place sucks. The manager didn't do anything for the cashier to help her move along faster. The manager should have been tending to the cashier and let the cashier dish out the food because the cashier doesn't know how to tend to a cash drawer. I've been going to Panda Express for many years in this place by far is the worst place of all Panda Express that I've ever been to and I like Panda Express I will have to find another location to go to because this location is a joke. I would have give zero stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"Went to Panda on the 29th and received a Military discount. Went to Panda on the 30th for my daughter and was told they don't give Military or any other discounts and mentioned seniors. I'm not real sure of Panda Express policy on this, I'v read on-line it's up to the store manager.  I have been going to this Panda since it opened and have always received a Military discount.  Has the management  at this location changed?  My one star is for service, the food is always good."}
{"text":"This location is a 50/50 crap shoot seriously as there is no consistency in how they operate. It really all depends on who is serving up your plate and/or what cook is making up the food as it can be good or it can be bad!  I can go in one day and get a fresh tasty combo and it be wonderful and on the next visit get a combo that is skimpy and taste old, dried and hard.  This is the closest and most convenient location to my house so it gets the most business from me and sometimes my visit is OK and sometimes it sucks ass.  The shrimp dishes are a rip off as they charge an additional $1 however give you just a few pieces of shrimp which is mostly vegetables or whatever the shrimp is mixed in with. If I order a shrimp item than give me some damn shrimp, OK!  Get your free sample so that you don't have to guess and wonder if you will like the item or not as they have new ones from time to time. I was not crazy about the new surf and turf item they have so I am glad I sampled it and ordered something else.  I really like the honey walnut shrimp however it is not always made the same way, it can be sweet or less sweet and more of just a plain mayo taste. When I order something that taste good then I come back for it and it taste completely different that is an issue for me.  I much prefer authentic Chinese and Cantonese food however on the go this will do the trick for American style Chinese food.   Consistency is key and they don't have it unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Walked in and there were only three tables with customers. All the rest were filthy: food on them, sticky. The floor was just as bad. The drink station was sticky and covered in soda. And there were more employees than customers in the store.   Most likely the worst Panda I've ever been in.   The food was hot but didn't seem fresh."}
{"text":"Crazy busy location, but the staff is great. Very friendly and efficient. The food was hot and fresh, what I would expect from Panda. The restaurant was filthy though. Tables were dirty and the drink station was trashed and smelled. That took away from the experience."}
{"text":"Paradise Valley Mall has the worst food court ever. Hence, why I'm eating at Panda Express. The only thing that tastes any good here is the orange chicken, which has a gazillion calories and grams of fat. But I'm gluten free so I can't eat that. Choking down my greasy Kung Pao chicken."}
{"text":"I LOVE Panda Express! I especially love that this one is within a mile from my home! everything on the menu is delicious, and i never can decide what to get. Only downside of this location is the drive thru wait time. there's been times where there may only be two cars ahead of me, and the wait can still be anywhere from 8-10 mins."}
{"text":"Panda Express is eh A-Okay. I think this location might be the only one, maybe two around town. For us West coasters, Panda Express is like the McDonalds of Chinese food. They're friggin everywhere - one on every corner of a three block radius and one in every mall.   It's nothing spectacular, very Americanized. I guess you can call it comfort American Chinese fast food. They advertise no MSG and offer a variety of dishes. Their orange chicken is kinda something special and has it's own unique Panda Express flair and flavor. While it isn't the greatest Chinese food by far, I've grown familiar with it, and have aquired a taste for it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would. First time coming to this Panda and I will NEVER come back here.   The two team members that made the experience the worst experience ever were the young Asian male and the older Asian woman. They were flat out rude and unpleasant. My entire party and I felt that we were getting pushed through the ordering process.  They were out of the Kung Pao chicken, so the employee said \"You wait or you pick something else\". FLAT OUT RUDE. They place our orders on the counter, and tell us to get them and sit down, but as we are doing that, we were yelled at and told \"Not yet I haven't charged it\".   As we sit down to eat, we noticed that the food is cold. The beef broccoli was raw. Hard, cold, raw broccoli. To top off this unpleasant visit, when the employee brought out the Kung Pao chicken, the chicken was RAW.  RAW CHICKEN.   We walk over and let them know that the chicken is raw, and the Young male starts arguing with us about how it's not raw because he made it and he knows how to cook it. He picks up a sample, tries it in the back and SURPRISE ITS RAW CHICKEN.   We get a refund, but we notice they have not removed the raw chicken from the entree table. As I'm writing this review, they still haven't removed it, instead the employees are talking about non-work related issues.   Definitely the worst Panda Express I have ever been to. To the management team: TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES AGAIN OR GET NEW EMPLOYEES.   To whomever is reading this review, if you have not come to this Panda, DO NOT GO. There's far better options for you to go to."}
{"text":"The realization that Panda Express is NOT the deal it used to be in the late 1990s & early 2000s. Today a combo of half fried rice/veggie chow mein with two entree choices with tax costs $8.00+ What's worse today is their meager portioning of your entree choices....this Panda Unit is the cheapest of all that I've been to in Las Vegas.....you get home and yes lots of greasy fried rice and chow mein but it's like two tablespoons each of your entree choices....a better deal is ordering one takeout entree with steamed rice from a regular Chinese restaurant...enough to feed two people for $9 or $10."}
{"text":"It's great. Do the survey, get a free item.  And get the Groupon deal where you link a specific credit card and get 10% cash back always."}
{"text":"It's Panda. Not as fresh food, they cook more when it runs out, but it meets my expectations so they get 5 stars.  Fill out the survey on the back of the receipt to get a free item on your next visit.  I bought the $25 gift cards around Christmas time and got the free 2 item meal. nice deal for sure."}
{"text":"Alright. First of all, we all know this isn't really Chinese food. That said, I wasn't expecting REAL Chinese. I was , however, expecting to get what I ordered. 2 plates with 2 entrees on each. The first was noodles with broccoli beef and orange chicken. The other was broccoli beef and vegetables with noodles. Neither had beef.....not a single morsel! Considering the vegetables were requested as the second entree, you would think it would be a mound. Nope.....more broccoli.   No napkins. Never again."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to this Panda Express location! I've always had great customer service, the food is always fresh and they never disappoint with the portions! Thanks for providing a happy, fresh and clean atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Thanks for shutting down early tonight.   We made the drive over to your location,  only to find the doors locked at 9:55pm.  Why post store hours if you're not going to adhere to it?   Don't get me wrong, I would have understood if you let me in and said, this is all we have left.   But instead,  you opted to give a friendly wave turn away business.  Guess what...There's plenty of other options out there.     Thanks again...not only did i lose out tonight,  but so did corporate and the store owner who pay the salaries."}
{"text":"The staff here is always super friendly, especially the manager and Maria (I think that's what her name is). The food is great and I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"I know this location just opened so I didn't give them 1 star. They have some things to work out. It took quite a while for them to get fried rice out and they weren't upfront about how long it would take. Also, the person that scooped my entree put it in the container knowing it was going to be a bit until they got the rice out so the entree was out of the heating area for a while."}
{"text":"The cashier that ringed us tonight clearly high. She asked 3x if i want to have wontons or spring rolls which i have to repeatedly refused. Then, she asked if i want to round up my bill which i again politely refused by saying no thank you. She rounded up my bill for donation. Line was quite long so i just let it go. Last one, i asked for an extra spoon for my daughter which she put in. Guess what she put in the spoon but no other utensils were provided. Legalization sure have its effect...:)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since the place has opened, and it is just ok.  There is something about Panda Express that just doesn't seem like Chinese Restaurants.  It could be that you have Hispanic chefs making Chinese dishes, not unlike blacks making Mexican food at Taco Bell.  The food isn't bad, but it isn't good either.  I eat at the Carowinds location more often than this one, but only because they are on the meal program.  This location is mainly clean and service is generally ok, it's just that the food has nothing special about it, and the egg rolls are perhaps the sorriest example comerically available.  If the price was a little less, they might rate higher, but at their prices, you can go to a local Chinese Restaurant and get better food for less."}
{"text":"overall one of the better panda expresses, not my favorite place in the world but sadly prob the best \"chinese\" food your going to find in vegas."}
{"text":"If you like food poisoning then Panda Express is the place for you. I've been burned too many times by Panda Express and I can say with conviction that I will never be back to any Panda Express again."}
{"text":"I really need to stop eating at Panda Express and thinking it will get better the next time I visit one. It just seems to get worse and worse every time. I mean it's been at least two years since I last went to one hoping it would be better this time around, but  I was sorely disapointed.   What can I say other then the fried rice was bland, the shrimp dish lacked shrimp but at least the cream cheese wontons were solid. After all was said and done, I really wish I had spent my money somwhere else. What happened to the days of their iconic orange chicken and other goodies? I remember how much I used to love going to these places. Oh well, I tried and they failed."}
{"text":"Not worth your time. Ordered a large fried rice in the drive through. I got a large chow mein. Didn't check the order until I was down the road. At that point it wasn't worth turning around. Called and the manger didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"A guilty pleasure of mine whenever I leave the NYC area. Has the lo mein/rice, angus steak, and the new chicken option. Food was a little saltier compared to most locations. They didn't have Orange Chicken at the time I went which was a bit disappointing. Other wise, it was ok."}
{"text":"The only reason someone has to read reviews of this place is because of the service. The food is always consistent and will always look and taste the same (So darn tasty). Now since we got the obvious out of the way.   The service was a little off today. Please make sure if you order double anything, they actually give you 2 servings. Just a tip. If you are going to order 2 or more entrees, please have them only put one on your plate. Have them package your other entrees separately."}
{"text":"This one is located inside of Red Rock Casino. I was expecting the same service and food, but obviously I didn't get it. I was the only one in line and I felt like they didn't want to help me. Not too many places you can order food from and they don't talk to you. Panda Express is a franchise food spot, so they serve the same exact food and sauce. So why were my noodles extra dry? What is crazy about all of this is that I will still go back and get the same food again."}
{"text":"Close to my work, good place to grab lunch and portions are generous. Less crowded and lay out is better than other Panda Express in town."}
{"text":"Two visits in a row that they are out of everything except orange chicken. It was 5:30 pm! No one cooking anything. We go to this one often because my son works at Fry's. Not any more. No excuses."}
{"text":"Obviously an establishment doesn't end up with a 1.5 star rating on Yelp for nothing, so to echo what many others have already stated, here is my experience...  My husband and I have been here 3 times within the past month or so. We used to eat at a location in Columbus, so we were happy when they opened one up here. Unfortunately, this Panda Express needs serious help. Each time we have visited our food was totally fine, so there's no problem with that. But the staff here are so incredibly slow that you should expect to sit in the drive thru for at least 15-20 mins. The past 2 times we went the drive thru was closed for whatever reason (they literally parked a car there to block it,) so we needed to go inside to order. The people working inside are sadly just as slow. It's essentially a cafeteria style line where you just point at what you want, so you'd imagine that would be quick, but some of the employees still move at a snails pace.   Now, as long as the food is decent I can handle slow employees. But what I cannot handle are the attitudes! Today, a girl Aryanna (sp?) was serving us and she was incredibly rude, had such an attitude, didn't listen, and then argued with us when SHE misunderstood the order. Then she stops in the middle of making our order and asks another girl to do it. The next girl was nicer, but this poor girl puts our containers in the bag and pushes it across the counter to me, and the food starts spilling out inside of the bag. This has happened every time! I mean guys, it's really not hard to put the containers in the bag in such a way that they don't spill, I promise! I know it seems ridiculous but it's clear that they seriously need shown how to do this.  The icing on the cake though, was a letter posted on the door of the restaurant from the manager Darlene, basically telling customers that it's the holidays, the holidays are stressful to everyone, and if you take your frustrations out on her employees you'll be asked to leave. I had to laugh out loud at this because firstly, it's incredibly unprofessional. But secondly, because the manager legitimately must not realize that the people who are probably \"getting frustrated\" at her employees are frustrated at the fact that a majority of the employees are slow, rude, and incompetent- it's not because it's the holidays!! Perhaps if Darlene would hop on here and read these reviews, and take the customer feedback into consideration, maybe she'd realize that the frustration lies within the attitudes and competency of the employees, and that the holidays have nothing to do with it.   Bottom line- the food is fine, the employees are subpar, so it is what it is. We'll still go there because it's the only one up here, and because our food has always been fresh and tastes as it's supposed to. But 2 stars is all this restaurant will be getting from me."}
{"text":"I love a good freebie and today I enjoyed the firecracker chicken small entree free. This location was quick service and the chicken was very good. Its a spicy dish and I loved the veggies.  Panda has consistently tasty food and  its reasonably priced.  As long as they keep sending the freebie coupon,  I will be a Panda devote."}
{"text":"Always have a good variety at the Panda! They introduce a lot of new dishes too, which I often get to try free thanks to Facebook. I really like their shrimp dishes and usually anything with \"spicy\" in the name is good to go. A recent stand out was the pepper chicken.  When their food is hot & fresh, it's very yummy and is not so bad the next day either!"}
{"text":"The worst employees ever.  Went in on a Sunday afternoon and there were no customers in line, but 6 people behind the counter.  Waited 5 minutes before I was acknowledged and my order was taken. Then when I went to the cashier she thought it was more important to fill up the sauce packets than cash me out.  The kicker was when I got home I noticed she overcharged me for my egg roll. Absolutely terrible, never going back. They deserve to go out of business."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panda Express I've ever been to. I'm ALWAYS waiting for them to cook my food, when they give me my other sides the food rarely tastes fresh, and they tend to forget things when packing up my to go bag. Unfortunately this is the only panda in Suprise..... Needless to say, we probably won't be having panda for another few months."}
{"text":"Overall this place continues to disappoint me. I only come here because my kids love this place. You are always waiting on your food and even at best the other food that is ready to go is always way too dry for consumption."}
{"text":"I had the black pepper chicken.  It was OK, too spicy for me.  It didn't have a spicy pepper on the tag so I just assumed it was mild.  Probably will just stick with the orange chicken from now on......"}
{"text":"The staff especially the manager(?) was very helpful. They are always helpful, and pleasant. I'm taking a minute to tell you about the service I always receive. It never changes always clean, pleasant & helpful. Good Job! He let me know which dishes are very spicy and pays attention to me when I say I have a shrimp allergy. Plushe just takes time to talk the personal touch goes a long way. He was also very complementary of his staff. Good leadership."}
{"text":"I have visited 4 times. So far this place is cool! Always a very tasty food :-)"}
{"text":"I have to at least give it one star as there is no zero available. Ate there Monday and all 4 of us came home felling sick to our stomach. The owner was there for a short minute, he was rude, obnoxious and had an attitude towards his employees. But the real questions is: What they are serving is it really beef or chicken or ?"}
{"text":"Alex and Liz were both awesome! Made me a very happy customer. I work across the street and I will frequent just because of those two!  Also the food is always fresh, even at 9pm! This location has their shit together for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the worst experience from a Panda Express restaurant. I walked in with my family at 9:40 pm there was a couple in front of us that received their plates of food. When it came time for us to order there was literally nothing there and the girl working told us they weren't making any more food for the night. So I asked her what time they closed at she said 10:00 pm and I asked her why they weren't making anymore food she said cause their about to close. So I asked if there was a manager I could speak to and of course they wasn't one on site. So we left and went to another one who had a drive thru opened until 11pm. I called the next morning no manager again so I left my name and number didn't receive a call back. So I call today and I was told I need to call back in 30 minutes not that the manager would call me back in 30 minutes or even when she has time. They will never have to worry about me and mine coming back and it's a shame that it's in such a beautiful area and the young women who work at night have such disgusting attitudes of you don't want to work there and be pleasant with all customers get a different job."}
{"text":"My fiancé loves panda...needless to say we enjoy some Chinese food often!  We have had trouble with this location not wanting to make food because they cleaned up the kitchen an hour before closing time.  We have also had issues with waiting to get an egg roll and the girl behind the counter bags one and gives it to the lady 3 people behind us.  ALTHOUGH there are quite a few issues that have gone on we talked with the manager on duty and he tried to make it right!  We definitely appreciate him being attentive to our concerns!"}
{"text":"I was so excited that this location opened up. However, THE DRIVE THRU IS SOOOO SLOW!! seriously it is so ridiculous."}
{"text":"It's going downhill. Food tastes different and takes a long time to wait. On a Saturday they still make a tiny bit of food at a time. I would understand if they don't want to waste food on a slow day but even on weekends?"}
{"text":"Yelp seemingly made a mistake putting this Panda in the American (New) category, but that's closer to the truth than \"Chinese.\" Anyone living in the Fast Food Nation knows Panda Express is no closer to Chinese food than Chef Boy-Ar-Dee is to Italian.  That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it.   I prefer this location to the one out Charleston by Home Depot.  It's more pleasant and relaxing because there are no stun tunes blaring while you try to enjoy a meal. Last visit to the Charleston location they had the heat cranked up even though it was at least 80 degrees outside.  Yes, Vons has tunes piped in over a dreadful sound system but the store wisely tones it down. It's what \"background\" music should be:  in the background. Kudos to the store manager. Their climate control shows they are not in denial about what's going on outside.  This Panda has a strange practice of not being ready at the stated opening.  If you arrive at 10 a.m. expecting to choose among their menu items you will instead find the cook scrambling to get things going.  You'll be asked to come back later!  BEEF BROCCOLI?  FORGET IT! Another visit we arrived at 10:30 and asked for beef broccoli. It'll be a 9 minute wait, we were told. We assumed the solo attendant would get our order started right away. NO! She finished waiting on the other five customers first.  By then we were halfway through our meal.  She explained that beef broccoli is best consumed fresh. The hurried preparation compromised the quality, however. Forget beef broccoli.  Choose something else.  It's not the staff's fault.  The proprietor seeks to maximize profits by hiring a single multitasking attendant. Like many businesses practically guaranteed a steady flow of customers, they couldn't care less about any one customer's experience.  If you can work around the problems this location throws at you, it's not a bad place to grab a bite before shopping."}
{"text":"Panda Express is one of the quick serve outlets inside Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa. We intended to use our half-price coupon for the Feast Buffet but were startled to discover a humongous line (Saturday about 11:39).  Do people really wait an hour just to get into a stinking buffet? Are they giving the food away? (No! It's $10 for lunch!)  We made our way to the food court, where you can also choose among Fatburger, Villa Pizza, Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill, Capriotti's Sandwich Shop and Tropical Smoothie.    We wanted no part of Fatburger.  You pay $10 for a meal (more of a snack) that includes a skinny burger similar to the dollar menu at other chains. You get approximately 15 fries.    We settled on Panda Express. It's marginal Asian-style food, not really good but usually not bad. It vaguely reminds you of eating in an actual Chinese restaurant. It's the kind of choice you make when your original plan goes wrong and the chaotic casino environment jams your brain. It can foul you up even when you're not gambling.  They botched our order and overcharged me. I had a hard time getting them to straighten out the overcharge. I get the impression most Panda employees speak little or no English.  It doesn't help that the food court is located in an extremely noisy part of the casino.  It's not surprising they fouled up the order. It's hard to hear anything. Red Rock is vying to be the noisiest casino in Vegas. After a while the hellish din leaves you numb.  What you do manage to hear is the annoying grating sound the metal chairs make when they scrape against the tile floor.  What genius thought that would be nice?  Every few seconds it's \"screeech! screeech! screech!\" from people moving their chairs.    I say skip the food court unless you enjoy eating in a noisy, stressful environment. I don't know why we didn't go to the Grand Cafe. You can get a decent meal there for about the same money."}
{"text":"It is a Panda Express, so obviously it is pretty predictable and most of us know the menu and the décor.  Although I really enjoy this location, as it is usually pretty busy so the food turnover is quick, meaning the food always seems to be pretty freshly prepared.   I really enjoy the honey walnut shrimp, with steamed rice and the spring rolls. My absolute favorite part of coming to Panda Express is their fortune cookies!"}
{"text":"This is a fast food place so getting it out of the way - food quality, options, and price are all the same as every other location; if you've been to one in those regards you've been to them all and know what to expect. The main thing to talk about in a review really is the staff and location itself. For the latter, I'm used to much smaller sized Panda Expresses so this one is really big and spacious inside with plenty of seating - and it's worth mentioning that the food area is all really nicely set up. It definitely doesn't feel bad at all coming in here or eating in here. The drive-thru (also something I've never personally seen at one of these) seems as fast and efficient as you'd expect as well, though it suffers from an issue everywhere in the city seems to where the microphone for the employee is way too quiet but it's just barely understandable if you listen closely. As for staff - every time I've come here they've been really nice, really quick, and don't come off as if they hate their job or that you're inconveniencing them. They also don't skimp at all on the portions, I've been to some locations where they'll just half fill everything but they do the opposite (in a very good way) here.  I'm not a fan of more...\"authentic\" Chinese food, but Panda gets the idea of what someone like me wants out of my fast food and the staff here makes it a good experience. Recommend the orange chicken."}

{"text":"I don't write too many reviews of \"fast food\" places, but this Panda Express really deserves a good one! I have been in twice in the past month or so and am amazed at how friendly the staff is here, top notch customer service that I would expect at a much higher end place.   Both times the service was fast and super friendly. The food ranges anywhere from very good to okay but it's a great option if your tired of burgers, tacos or your usual go to lunch. They have several vegetarian options as well. If you're around Eastern/Horizon Ridge and are looking for a quick lunch this is a good option.   5 stars for the service, 3 stars for the food."}
{"text":"I've notability been going to this Panda Express ever since I was a kid. Even so I still continue to eat here once and a while. For old times sake I've reckon I'll do a review about this Panda Express.   Very clean and organized even when the line can get pretty long. I like how once you get to the front counter, employees are greeting you and getting you on your way. I've never have had a major problem while visiting here and the food quality is good! I recommend this location out of other nearby Panda's."}
{"text":"Before this experience you would have had a hard time getting me to come with you to a Panda Express. However, my coworkers wanted me to come to lunch with her and this is her favorite place so off we went.  She originally didn't know that this location existed & she was also pleasantly surprised.  Upon arrival, we were greeted very nicely and walked into a very clean restaurant. The staff was very friendly and attentive.   I enjoyed the fact that they offer steamed brown rice and brown fried rice. It is nice to see such options.  The food was amazingly fresh, my vegetables cooked perfectly with some crunch to it. It wasn't heavy in oil or grease to my surprise either. I have ate at other Panda Express' before but I do not ever recall leaving one, thinking that my food was pretty good and that I would return. They also carry this peach green tea that I cannot get enough of.   One of the staff members walked around while we ate and asked everyone if everything was okay. He did this a couple of times during my visit & he made sure to not ask the same customer twice. I like that."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying, I knew better than to come to panda. This is now my 3rd visit in a row that I have came here and they literally have NO food available!! What the heck?! I understand it's late. However, should there not be food available to purchase up until closing time?? I'm done trying with panda! You don't care about customers!!"}
{"text":"I am always curious to see the differences once a chain restaurant comes up from the US to Canada. Usually it is not as good. I am happy to report that is not the case with this Panda Express location. The food was well prepared and flavourful. That said, this is sub par Chinese food at best and should not be eaten as in place of a legit restaurant serving truly authentic Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I was very eager to try this place when it opened. Today I finally had the chance. My bf an I stopped by and got two orders, total of 5 entrees. I had the fried rice, sweet fire chicken breast and bejing beef. my Bf, had the general tso's, coconut shrimp and Shanghai beef. Plus two fortune cookies. The food was awful. All the chicken taste the same. The general tso's (although an american dish), was tart. This is not good chinese food. I've had Chinese food in 30 different states, in China, in parts on Korea and even in Europe. This was the worse.  Kudos to those that feel it is good. As for me, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I like this one because it has a drive thru and they serve more soups than the other one on Nellis/Sahara. Better for me, I would say."}
{"text":"I just did not know any better at the time, I should have spent the additional $5 and gone to the buffet. No complaints about the food or service but when in Vegas, go to the buffets. This place is across from the NYNY in a food court and open late but go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not sure who trains these people but they did a terrible job. I didn't want to give this place a bad review but they earned this shit!!!.. the food is good here but the people serving it have NO clue what they are doing. I'm all for giving dip shits jobs I think if some one wants to work they deserve a chance but come on people!!! Is it really possible to have this many dip shits working on the same shift (evening shift) to top it off the the chick working the drive thru gave me attitude because I didn't want to donate to there charity... this locatin SUCKS!!!! Try tayriaki madness a Lil further up the road. The foods great the service is good and they aren't dip shits. .."}
{"text":"Panda is usually good for a quick fast food Asian bowl.  It is good when they have a large selection of fresh cooked items and the trays are stocked.  Depending on when you get there the selection can leave a lot to be desired with only a few sad and lonely dry entrees.  If you get there when they have fresh stuff it is rather good.  I like the one item bowl with rice.  The Kung Pao chicken actually has a little kick to it which is a nice surprise.  The lo mien is good but can be a little oily.  Beat to stick to rice.  The sweet items on the menu are way to sweet for me so I usually get a kung pao chicken or broccoli beef.  The portion is good - not too much and you feel as though you are eating somewhat healthy.  Love the ices teas they have because here in Arizona that is crucial."}
{"text":"Could use improvement. Online, Panda Express states they now offer a tea bar, yet this location doesn't offer it. It's a Chinese food establishment (all be it, American Chinese) and they do not offer chopsticks. Noodles offers chopsticks for their few Asian dishes yet Panda Express doesn't? Really? We used a $10 gift card we received from Panda Express for screwing up our order over a year ago (can you tell we don't go here often?). Good food, but service and provisions offered could be better. Keep going hoping they've improved... *sigh* I guess we'll try again next year."}
{"text":"This location has really gone downhill. We used to travel out to this one specifically because they always had hot food ready. However, several times recently the food had been really bad. Rangoons we're not even lukewarm, rice was extra watery or greasy, sauces on the chicken we're starting to solidify from sitting out so long. Our most recent trip was what prompted this review. It was dead, 1 employee, Autumn, was manning the food and register while 4-5 employees were hanging out in the drive thru corner talking amongst themselves. No one was helping at all. We turned around to filthy tables and even filthier floors. We tried wiping the tables down ourselves with napkins and water, wondering why all those employees weren't doing anything, even the supervisor was sitting there looking bored out of her mind. So we asked for a broom and they pointed at Autumn to go help us and clean up the floor for us, how lazy can they be?! Poor girl was the only one doing anything and it really spoke volumes about this location, sad it's gotten so bad. Also they still have a table still broken off and missing so they have this little orange cone just hanging there, cmon guys, just keep the place clean at least, what a mess!"}
{"text":"We all know that this is not authentic Chinese food. But hey, Panda Express has been around for years and I have always liked them because they are cheap, fast, and their food keeps me full!    This location isn't too bad. There are many parking stalls outside and the restaurant is clean. However, I do feel sorry for the employees who are working here. It seems like every time I stop by, there is only one employee behind the counter who has to deal with a long line of customers and no one else is around to help out. But even under all that stress, they try to be friendly and are always asking if I would like to sample any entrees.   The main problem with Panda Express is that you don't know how long the food has been sitting there, and they don't make a fresh batch until they run out of something. Sometimes the fried rice is dry, the egg rolls are not crispy, and some of the other entrees may lack flavor.   Over the years, I have become a fan of Pick Up Stix. But since they don't have any locations here in Vegas, Panda will have to do for now."}
{"text":"Came in 45 minutes before closing and they had almost nothing on the line. 10% of the normal choices were available. I asked if they had something that I didn't see on the line. He said they didn't but that they could make something in 10 minutes so I said okay. He turns back to the cook, and the cook refuses to make anything else... 45 minutes before closing. So if you just want rice and broccoli, this is place to go! The 1 star goes to the guy behind the counter because he was very nice and apologetic that he wasn't in charge of there not being any food."}
{"text":"Ill start by saying since the food at any panda will taste pretty similar, the only difference is how fresh you get it. A couple times the food has been Dry or not very warm.  The customer service for food chains is probably the selling point but This one is pretty average. Sometimes its hard to understand a couple of the ladies that work there but who doesnt know how to order panda? Tell them what you want and they give it to you not very hard. Not 4 stars because panda isn't a four star type of food. But maybe yelp should develop a customer service rating star rating and a customer service star rating lots of places with better food than service or vice verse"}
{"text":"I come into this Panda Express quite frequently I don't know if they were having an off day this time or what but half the entree trays were almost empty and it was lunch time on a Saturday afternoon. I was fortunate to be the second in a line of about 20 people. Only 1 person working the front and she was scrambling to keep up!   Needless to say I had to stand there waiting for about 15 minutes along with others until they made more Orange Chicken and Beef and Broccoli. It wasn't the girls fault and I'm super understanding that things happen but the people behind me were complaining up a storm.   Maybe they should bring in more staff during lunch runs even on Saturdays. Just my input"}
{"text":"I usually come here if I've had a long day running errands and I don't feel like cooking at home but I've noticed that compared to some other locations that this location is a little stingy with the food"}
{"text":"GREAT JOB AVIE, AMANDA, SONJA AND STAFF!! Avie runs a tight friendly ship! Everyone was working, cleaning, helping customers. Great customer service and great selling of the product! Ive been coming to this location for years and boy had it changed under her leadership. I wish i could film it and show my boss this us how you run a restaurant! Great job!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a patron of PE since going to thier restaurant in Pasadena YEARS AGO. I still am a very frequent customer but what I saw at this location disturbed me..I walked in to a dirty place..where not a single person either customer or worker was speaking English. .not Mandarin or Cantonese either but SPANISH...REALLY?? Don't get me wrong: I'm Mexican too but I couldn't get past the feeling that I was going that something wasn't right. Everyone stared at ME like I was the misfit and i got uncomfortable there. I couldn't trust Chinese food being served in an atmosphere of being at La Bonita. They just made me feel very uncomfortable by not speaking English and making me feel like I don't belong..and the food looked overcooked and not fresh at all"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, kind faces welcome you. It's very clean and you have a wide range of food you can choose from. The price is average. I had the orange chicken and chicken fried rice. The food was good and normal like others. It's spacious and nice."}
{"text":"We recently came in for dinner and all of us became very ill I usually wouldn't post something about being sick but we had called the restaurant to inform them that we had a group of teenagers with us all of became ill was wondering if anyone else complained just to see if it was the food since the only thing we all did together. The manager I think she said that she was a manager her name Tammy was so rude my guess woke on the wrong side of the bed she kept talking and I couldn't even get a word in . Instead of sounding concerned she stated not go eat there anymore lol ok then we won't we'll definitely not this location. So my advice don't call to complain."}
{"text":"Very good food however Mongolia beef really spicy.  They have a drive threw located off of craig."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Somehow a notch above other  Pandas I have visited. Food quality wise  that is."}
{"text":"Very clean and modern. There is a drive thru which is an added plus. The staff was friendly and helpful. Only wish was more veggie options although that is most likely on a corporate level. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a issue with my order when I got home it was wrong not even close to what I ordered.  I called and talked to Ramsey the manager. He made everything right and took care of the issue.  This is called customer service and he created a Raving Fan  Thank you for great customer service Ramsey. Someone should make sure he does not go anywhere what a great employee."}
{"text":"I do not know how they stay in business we do takeout get home had two bowls and one two plate the bowls were half full and the meal was the same.  Every time we go to this one the meal is bad service is crappy and they always mess up. Then if you say something nothing happens anyway. I guess it better to dive to the Estrella one so much better like 4 stars better. I have even talked to the mgr he does not care either."}
{"text":"They make Chinese like food.  Sometimes its edible, most times everything tastes like orange chicken."}
{"text":"Good food but EVERY time I come it's short staffed and wait AT LEAST 15 mins, today it was 30! Employees are slow and don't pay attention to the 15 people waiting in line. From now on I won't come here unless I do the online ordering because this is ridiculous, I've got my food faster at sit down restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered a 2 item entree. And it seems that the portions they give is so small. It's like McDonald's.  The portions keep getting smaller and smaller but the price keeps going higher and higher.    I asked if I could have a little more orange chicken and she said she was going to charge me for another item. Seriously.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Timing is what it's all about people!!   The wife and I rarely get to eat out together and decided to go to Canton Dragon via 75th ave. The entire street, from Thomas to Indian School Rd. was closed due to a head on collision that killed 2 people we found out later. Turned around and went to Panda Express armed with 2 coupons for 2 extra free entrees. We were starving by 8pm so we opted to dine in. We got lucky and hit a lull and were able to order immediately. We ordered a little of everything from chow  mein and honey shrimp ($1.25 extra) to beef and broccoli to walnut chicken. We didn't expect much flavor wise and being hungry we didn't care! The a/c thermostat must have been set on 68 degrees and after waiting to pay, finding a clean table and dodging numerous unsupervised children our food was cold. Total price for this experience was just this side of $20.00 even with coupons and no drink order. This dining experience is true testament that timing is everything! Could have been much worse! Just glad to be safely home with no suspicious abdominal gurgling!"}
{"text":"So I confess I wasn't happy when the others in our group wanted to come here because we couldn't get in a nearby restaurant.  I mean, I was in VEGAS and a chain was not in my foodie plan.  But darn it was GOOD.  Really good!  So fresh!  and I loved loved loved all the veggie options and choices for combinations.   Oh and the prices can't be beat.  Yes it's counter-service and casual, but it's good food with healthy options at a really good price.  Fill up and go conquer the Vegas night!"}
{"text":"The worse chain for eating chinese foods, I think. It's in a galleria of Las Vegas. I ordered a meal with vegetables, Orange chicken, Beijing beef and rice. It's not too bad but all is prepared quick and you are not be able to enjoy your foods also, there are too much people in this restaurant (december 2017). Just to calm your belly but not your stress, your digest will be bad."}
{"text":"The stars are coincidentally for the chicken. On 12/20/16 my 8 month pregnant wife, 16 month daughter and I went on a drive to get my daughter a power nap. The nap didn't work and I was hungry so we stopped at Panda Express. I ordered the biggest plate which is 4 small portions and my wife ordered the regular 3 portion plate and we both got teriyaki chicken. The chicken was being cooked so the girl told us she would bring it out. I went to the register and another girl punched the order in and gave me a total of 19.50 or so (this is where it's my responsibility to do math and ensure she rang everything up.  After 7-8 minutes and people who ordered after us walking by with teriyaki chicken my wife went up to the counter. The conversation between her and the two girls lasted longer than I expected between a customer who wants chicken they paid for and two employees so I went up. What had apparently happened was the girl I ordered from acknowledged I ordered the large plate but she said the other girl didn't charge me for it (it's a 1.50) so she couldn't give it to me.... OK I said, just give me 2 chickens instead of 3 and refund me.... Girl tilts her head, rotates the microphone out from her face and says... \"What for?\" We'll probably because after ten minutes my wife, daughter and I don't have any chicken. This is when she tells me she'll need a manager. I was honestly excited because obviously the manager would understand the concept of customer service as well as the idea that her employees ringing my order up wrong and acknowledging they did, should not result in an argument over 1.50 in chicken. At this point it was purely an argument for me based on principal. Anyways the manager comes up and asks what happened. I told her there was a miscommunication between her two employees on what was ordered and rang in, my family had no chicken and I wanted our 3 orders..... I kid you not, the manager looks at me and says \"I can't give you 3 because you only paid for 2.\"  Convinced she didn't hear what happened, I explained that her employee acknowledged she rang me up wrong, it's not my responsibility to do math at a register and I asked if she was really willing to lose a customer over a dollar fifty and a bad review online. She was more than willing so here I am. If someone wants to reach out to me from this restaurant  I'll gladly post a follow up based on my interaction with them but as of now I can see why they currently have two stars. MERRY CHRISTMAS!"}
{"text":"Panda Express usually isn't my first choice for Chinese or Asian cuisine, but this place has one draw and one draw only... a drive thru. When I'm on my lunch hour and I need to get a quick bite on the go after shopping at the outlets or if I'm just in the area and want to get something fast.   The service is standard and If you order the right menu items, you can actually make a relatively healthy lunch choice here."}
{"text":"It's a typical Panda Express, but the plus is that they have a drive-thru. I'm not typically a fan of Panda Express, but I was in a rush and I was hungry, so I sped through the drive through and it's quick and pretty good if you're on the run."}
{"text":"I think a improvement in spice would be a good idea being able to make something not as Spicey would open up more food options i really like your honey shrimp maybe a opportunity to have a sit down menu for people who don't want alacart so they can order fresh with the food being seasoned to taste just a few ideas I had."}
{"text":"Panda express....the only location in yyc as of date. I've been twice. So when you go in...you can ask to taste. Then the food is so fresh...they cook their different dishes at least every 10mins. There's at least 5 or 6 people working...but because it's so busy...steady stream of people...they could use maybe 1 more person. I just find the supervisor unprofessional he was yelling at his employees. They don't have tip jar either with the amount of things they have to do... If you want Chinese food...its a good place to go to...more westernized  kind of Chinese food...its always fresh though...thats the awesome part of it..."}
{"text":"So we rarely eat Panda. If we want our Asian fix we go to our normal Chinese restaurant. My nine year old said he wanted it and we hadn't had it in forever.  Smelled good as we pulled up at lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We went inside because we weren't sure what we wanted. Both opted for 2 entree' combos with chow mein. Sweetfire chicken and String Bean chicken for me. He wanted double order of Orange Chicken. 2 spring rolls and 1 drink to go.  Ordering was fast and all we came in contact with were happy and pleasant. Food all looked freshly prepared. So we drive the short distance home and my son opens his box and it has beef and broccoli and orange chicken. Saying he wasn't happy is an understatement! He ate the chicken and the beef had a decent flavor but was chewy and just became a flavorless ball of meat that he couldn't swallow. Mine was normal Panda food. Solid 3 stars. But for $20 we expected our order to be correct."}
{"text":"Food was kinda gross. I had the orange chicken and  it was gross. I decided to trash it and have the pepperoni pizza but that was gross too. Usually I find anything appetizing when I'm starving but this tasted bad even then. The service was good however. It was a busy day but they were still polite and attentive.    4 stars for service  0 for food"}
{"text":"Once again very disappointed , every time I visit rhis location the food has been sitting there and looks so disgusting , my family and I visited yesterday around 430 in the afternoon, nothing was fresh fro the veggies being brown and soggy from the orange chicken so disgusting, we had to wait at least 35 minutes to get everything fresh cause nothing was ready! The chow mein was soggy and tasted horrible, we go to this location cause the workers are so kind and it's right near my home, I don't want to go elsewhere but seems like nothing changes"}
{"text":"Yes Derek T here's my email , evacosfol@gmail.com I can't post my number from my previous complaint"}
{"text":"We visit this location at least once a week, and every time the food isn't fresh I usually have to request a fresh batch of chow mein cause it's dry or mushy which my son won't eat, plus the broccoli and beef was brown and mushy, seems like it's been sitting there in the pan for a while, and the string bean chicken breast was that I got old brown string beans with 2 pieces of chicken, seems like every time I visit I have to wait at least 5 min for someone to greet or even acknowledge that your just standing there to get served! And waiting 10 minutes for fresh food! But I visit here cause it's close to where I live!"}
{"text":"Fresh Chinese Fast Food.  The Orange Chicken is always tasty as is the Chow Mein and Chicken and Mushrooms.  This makes a good 3 item dish and is pretty filling.  Sometimes I like just getting a one item bowl of either of the 3.  My daughter when she was younger would want to come her multiple times a week and they would know what she wants when she came in. She would get the kids meal with white rice and orange chicken with a lemonade. No cookie which is horrible!! How on earth can you make a bad chocolate chip cookie???  We will be back many more times for this white man's chinese food :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite all time panda express location. Food is always great especially when you come weekends night. Their cook at Nights is spectacular! So fast and efficient always a great food!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. This Panda Express is always out of whatever I'm ordering. I have been to this particular Panda Express a total of 5 times since opening and all 5 times they managed to screw my order up. I know that opening a new restaurant is always a little difficult but the people who won the employment lottery and somehow found themselves employed at this place, make the same mistakes every single time I've come here. I will not be going back any time soon, under any circumstances, because I know beyond a reasonable doubt these morons are 100% going to f*** my order up or magically run out of chow mein or general tso's."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I've given them multiple chances knowing the brand and liking them before. Unprofessional people work there. Shift leader/supervisor hung up on me when I called about a total rip off incorrect, cold, greasy, disgusting order.   Disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted something simple. I wanted something quick. I wanted it to be some vegetables and some rice. Well Panda Express had exactly that. steamed vegetables and rice and I was oh so happy. Thank you panda Express for having something simple in addition to all your other choices which I passed on this time.  thank you very much and i was very pleased with the vegetables the rice and a little of that chili sauce and my mouth had a good time.  thank you very much"}
{"text":"Food was great, generous portions, they piled on the entrees, despite the to go box already pretty full. Good to see. Didn't see any old lady maybe that's why."}
{"text":"This location is like all panda express locations except harder to find. My gps was telling me I was there but I kept passing it because it could not be seen hidden behind trees and bushes. Once inside they were out of most items so there was a wait, but the upside is I got fresh food. Prices could be better, but the staff was friendly and the lobby was clean and not crowded."}
{"text":"Went to Panda for dinner and when we got home I opened my daughters kids meal and it had 4 pieces of orange chicken. No biggie, I'll give her some of mine. Open my plate and there is 3 pieces of sweet fire chicken breast in mine. Worst service I've ever received. I called  and explained what happened and they said I could go back to receive my complete order. They also mentioned that they were low on orange chicken, once I called. The thing is I would have waited for more to be made, had they told me. Had to load both kids back and go back thru the drive thru to receive my complete order. By the time we made it back home our food (the 1st order) was cold. I will not be returning back to this panda."}
{"text":"I check the website for the schedule,  got there 11:07 pm, they were close and the staff inside they didn't open the door even to tell me why they closed 23 minutes before (web site says that they should close on Saturday at 11:30 pm) Love PE, but I will never go back to this location and I saw that other people had same problem"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner this evening at about 7pm. It was not very busy and they kept running out of food. Eventually the line became very backed up. After we paid for our 4 combo plates we were told that we would have to wait for our pot stickers and beef.  Paid and sat down. 15 minutes went by and our food was not ready yet (waiting on broccoli beef and pot stickers). We eventually got our food and began eating (without our broccoli beef and pot stickers). We were almost done and our food still did not arrive. So I went to the front of the line and got my order of broccoli beef, the cashier told me to have a seat and that she would bring me our pot stickers. Another 10 minutes pass and have They finally arrived. They were moist, soggy, and looked very under cooked."}
{"text":"Today I received horrible service, small portions and very slow service. Food tasted old and not warm enough. Because of this I won't be returning back to Panda Express in the future."}
{"text":"Good clean location. Food was freshly cooked when I went for lunch. Friendly staff, no complaints. I'll be going back to this one. :)"}
{"text":"Food is good.  I like the firecracker chicken, but they have it only for a couple of months.  There is a lot of salt in their food.  They cater to a lot of mexican parents with unruly kids climbing and running around and screaming though..  Its a real crapshoot if you want to quietly eat lunch."}
{"text":"We got the panda bowl with Beijing beef right before seeing Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian.    The Beijing beef was good."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, no clean tables, food on the floor and the soda area a total mess. Don't even go to the bathroom. You'll see urine and paper on the floor and graffiti on the walls. We will never go back to this one."}
{"text":"The staff is always very friendly and helpful. Very cheery and the food is great, too. I always feel comfortable going here and know that I will helped with any questions I may have. Or, in the rare case that they mess up an order, they happily fix it for me free of charge! Great location."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to be super friendly when I pull to the drive thru at night which makes ordering a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Decent food. Like the raspberry brisk option at the soda fountain.  You know how there are places that gives poor portions, good portions, or generous portions? This place gives poor portions. I recommended going elsewhere unless your lazy to drive further."}
{"text":"It's fast food. Yes. I picked up an order from the drive thru today.  My bill was about $20 and the amount of food we received was a lot.   I got the orange chicken, chow main, rice, chicken in pepper sauce and some other small entree my husband picked out.    All in all my only complaint is the drive thru time was kind of slow for fast food but ... really fast for Chinese.    My family loved the Orange Chicken.  They ate a ton.  The chow mein was practically ignored at dinner.  But I just reheated some and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Listen. This is fast food. And when you keep it in context.  It's awesome for what it is.    My kid loves it. The noodles and orange chicken are delicious. He can eat his body weight in this stuff."}
{"text":"Crap service tonight. Crap and rude workers. The food sucked and the fried rice was like I was just eating white rice(totally bland) The employees were extremely rude and not welcoming. An older gentleman in front of us was hard of hearing and the employees body language and tone showed irritation at the fact that she had to speak a little louder for the gentleman to hear, totally disrespectful. Whoever is in charge of this place should be kicked to the curb along with the existing workers and hire an entirely new crew. Not to mention they were out of soy sauce, which is odd for a large chinese food chain. Definitely not going to Panda for a while."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. They did not greet us when we arrived . Waited over 10 minutes for them to attend us and their was obviously a lot of employees there. One was in drive thru and the rest was in the back playing around."}
{"text":"I was in a bind yesterday and had to find a quick solution to a catered lunch for 15 realtors during a luncheon I was hosting. After doing a quick search online, Panda Express seemed to be the quickest option as it was close and the ordering/checkout process was extremely smooth. I ordered a tray of fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken and beef with broccoli that easily fed over 20 people. The food was ready at the time I requested and it was packed up perfectly to transport and setup for my event. The food was fresh and everyone seemed satisfied!"}
{"text":"Every single time I have been to this panda express location my order gets messed up. Going through the drive thru has got to be the worst possible idea. My order is always missing something and for someone who's had a long day and just wants to get a quick fix, it is very disappointing, to say the least. I am even more furious that they charge extra for the one thing they ALWAYS seem to forget.   It makes me angry to look forward to something and find out when I get home it is not even in the bag that they handed to me. You'd think that they would have everything ready to go for you when they had repeated the order twice to you and then proceeded to ask you for payment. I am very upset that not only has this happened once, but every single time that I have come to this location it never fails that something I pay for will be missing from my order!"}
{"text":"The food is what you expect if you've ever been to Panda Express but I have to say, boy are these people busy! It was a Thursday afternoon and the line was practically out the door. The guys cooking keep the food coming. There were 2 hispanic girls working the line and taking turns on the register, they did not miss a beat. You were welcomed when you walked in, they made eye contact as you ordered and once you paid for your food it was, thank you very much. That's more than you get in most places.  The bathrooms are super clean!!"}
