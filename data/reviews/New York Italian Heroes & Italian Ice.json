{"text":"This is my 1st review ever on this site. I have not worked for this company and am not disgruntled.   I had just gotten out of the hospital , had passed this place a dozen times as I live about a 1/2 mile up the road, am a former New Yorker and wanted a little comfort food and taste of home.

There were 4 people behind the counter and it took 20 minutes to get 2 hot dogs made correctly, a shaved ice, soda and a smoothy.  There was no line when I and my friend walked it, though we were followed by several others about 8 minutes after we arrived.

The hot dogs are not New York hot dogs, they are rather tasteless, soft 1/4lb dogs like one might get from 7-11. they weren't even hot, just simply warm and the bun seemed stale on the outside.

I had to remind the young man that was helping me three times of what it was I ordered.  When that was finally done, I looked at my hot dog to see if was made incorrectly and I asked him to take care of it, which he sent me to the other counter, so I politely said, please would you handle it.  The person making food was not very polite and when I asked that he remake both hot dogs so they are hot as they had gone colds he replied with an eye roll and a \"are you kidding me\" and then questioned me as to why I had not eaten the hot dog while waiting for the other things, when I had asked for the items \"To go\". He actually packaged the 2 dogs in a rather large pizza box, which seemed strange.

The lemon shaved ice was tasty, my friend said and I enjoyed the mango smoothy, but after the wait and attitude, which I think was the owner, I will not be returning. I gave 2 stars rather than one as the Italian ice and the smoothy was rather good."}

The only problem I had was that there were two measly pieces of spinach on my 6\" sandwich. Would definitely have liked a LOT more. However we also got the gelati and it was awesome, must try. The mango was excellent."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Having just moved back to the 'Burgh after living in Philly for 12 years, my standards are unnaturally high for NY-style fare.  One could argue that NY-style food is usually just as good in Philly as it is in NYC.  This hits the spot.  The heroes (aka. hoagies in Pittsburgh) are really tasty.  I purchased the #1 (salami+) and the #2 (prosciutto+).  The rolls were fresh (probably Mancini's) and the filling was great, though I'd like a bit more of it.  Still, for the cheap price of $8+change for a 12\" sub, it was pretty awesome.  

I'm going to try the Italian Ice (aka. water ice) and knish next.  I can't believe I can now get knishes in Bellevue! I'm working my way up to a pizza...  I'm not gonna lie, my standards are high for NY-style pizza.  Also, I should mention that the service was excellent.  The guy who waited on me was super friendly and speedy!  

It seems like NY Heroes & Italian Ice has a great start in Bellevue, and I'm really excited to try everything they have to offer.  In my memory no restaurant has ever succeeded long-term in this location, so I wish them luck!"}
