{"text":"I'm so glad I found this cute shop! Tonight I tried a strawberry raspado with coconut and pineapple ice-cream topped with sweet cream and fresh strawberries. It was so delicious! The shaved ice is a little big but the ice cream was amazing with big chunks of fruit. A cold, fruity treat perfect for a Arizona summer night. 
The shop was clean and neat with bright colors and lots of tables. 
I really appreciated the menu in English and Spanish.
The service was friendly and kind.
I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, super clean the owners are sweet and they have a pretty good menu. Raspados are amazing not super sweet and fruit taste very fresh every time!"}
{"text":"This place is great! If it's your first time visiting, you are in for a treat! This isn't your typical store. You can get creative and add all the different ingredients that they have. I highly recommend adding mango to the spicy stuff they have."}
{"text":"The guy was kinda rude.. like he didnt want your business... i walked in  and immedietly noticed the LOUD odor of something going spoiled or rotten.... the older lady was nice... good sno cone."}
{"text":"Like a Mexican froyo place (without the froyo) in the West Valley! Choose your size cup, what fruit, vegetables, chips, candy etc. you want and topped with Clamato, homemade chamoy, \"super hot sauce\", chile and limon. The best part...you don't pay by weight, just cup size and they pack everything in so you get the most possible. They also have raspados (real fresh fruit snow cones topped with ice cream and lechera and whatever else you want) and elotes (Mexican corn).
It's a little hidden gem tucked between a smoke shop and nail salon on 107th and Indian school, northwest corner; check it out sometime!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident!! And oh boy am I glad I did!!  If you like Mexican botanas this is ur place. They have two bars full of yummy ingredients like fruit, Tostitos, cacahuates, tamarindos, cerpentinas, Doritos, hot Cheetos and more that u get to choose to put in ur cup and then get mixed up with ur choice of sauces like tamarindo, Clamato, chamoy, lime juice and some spicy sauce they have. They also corn in a cup, which by the way is the best I had tried in town. Tastes like you are actually eating it on the streets of Mexico. They have Clamato cups that u get prepared the way u want. Also have raspados, and strawberries with cream. Everything looks so fresh and clean. 
I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get dessert it has many Hispanic desserts that I love! And they are not expensive and cheap about their portions which is what I love about this place. I've tried their tostiesquites too and they are so delicious I would recommend people to come here. The customer service is great as well the guy and girl there which look like the owners, are very nice and respectful."}
{"text":"very good when your craving corn in a cup! Shaved ice aka raspados etc.. it's nice and clean inside very impressed!!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! I would definitely recommend it , the elote with hot cheetos is definitely my favorite & the Jamaica is BOMB !!! Everything is just so good"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Elote place! The perfect mix of crunch flavor and corn! I highly recommend the original or the revolacado Takis flavor. Breanna is a real gem, her customer service keeps me coming. I bring in so many people to experience her awesome service and snacks ! Thank you Antojos your way I'll be back !"}
{"text":"Real Mexican snacks, you can make your snack your way! Like yogurland! Everything delicious, very clean, nice people good service. My favorite place !"}
{"text":"The good reviews got me to try this place out. I was really  disappointed with my chilindrina the Cueritos had an old taste and were soft. We also had a Clamato with shrimp which was also disappointing. They use the frozen shrimp it had the taste of defrosted fridge shrimp. My daughter had a corn with takis and I'm guessing it was good she ate it all. My son looked at everything and didn't get anything. We won't be coming back. Oh but the water was good ."}
{"text":"Overpriced and I've had better. I ordered the mangos sushi drink and the mangos were not ripe. Super hard. They should chop up the mangos into little pieces versus just putting the mango fruit on the side for Decor. 

 I also ordered the chips with corn on top super expensive. I also didn't like that all the toppings were cold. I was really hoping to write a wonderful review but it did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Everything tasted great,the place is clean and well maintained. Family friendly, from  a coffee to  something really spicy.  We got a mangoneada,ovizpo,elote,and two cups. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice little shop to get some mexican favorites! Love the elote and the fresas con crema!! Ice creams great and the people are nice."}
{"text":"Estoy enviciada con los tosti-elotes! Nunca he comido un antojo tan delicioso! Al principio me pareció una idea extraña la combinación de chips con elote pero de verdad es un antojo que vale la pena probar, solo espero que no se envicien como yo. 5 estrellas para el lugar, sus dueños y el menú! He probado casi todo!!!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. Brand new business. Super friendly owners. I ordered 3 chamoyadas and a tostielotes. All of the serving portions were appropriate. The establishment is very clean and well decorated."}
