{"text":"worst HK cha can ting i've ever been too. seriously! ok, i just added one more star to my rating, not trying to be a b**** here...   decor - whatever, it's a HK food place in chinatown! it explains everything server - pretty she was angry at us for no reason food - ordered HK style milk tea (3/5), duck noodle (2/5), fish ball noodle (0/5), and a beef dish (3/5).   will prob never go there again, unless i'm about to die of hunger in chinatown and there's nothing else."}
{"text":"I went with my family today June 30, 2012 and I don't recommend this place.  Great location and fast service although the waitress was a little forgetful.  So here is the review based on what we ate:  BBQ Duck w/Wonton Noodles Soup, BBQ Duck w/Pork and Wonton Noodles, House Special Chow Mein, and some Chicken with Noodles. Shrimp dumpling inside the dish was good.  BBQ Pork was excellent. Duck was ok.  Noodles were kind of UNcooked.  Vegetables OVERcooked.  Iced Tea with lemon was ok.  Hot green tea was ok. Chiken was kind of bland.Red beans with sparkles, uh!...  If you like to drink beans, ok.  Chicken was BLAND and the Soup too.    A lot of food not worth the price paying.  Worst part,when leaving my husband saw that the soup guy was \"washing\" some dirty cloth with the soup, squeezing the cloth over the soup and then \"cleaning?\" a pot with that same cloth. C'est incroyable. Plain nasty restaurant. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"When this place opened it was GREAT. Since then, it's a far cry from good. Definitely NOT a place I'd take company to introduce them to Chinese food.  - Bad service HOWEVER it IS an Asian restaurant IN Chinatown so you really shouldn't be expecting much,  - Good portions  - OK pricing  - MEDIOCRE food quality and taste.   If you're drunk and want a nicely lit restaurant with big portions and fast service- go here.  ***May I add: the congee a.k.a jook a.k.a rice soup is good. If you want good congee but don't feel like crowding your party into King Noodle, give Goldstone's a shot."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it filling,  and pretty tasty for the price.  They serve pretty big portions so it meets all my requirements for a good meal."}
{"text":"Had my brunch here with the BF the other day. Ordered Hainanese Chicken Rice and the BF ordered Curry Chicken Rice. It was the lunch special and it comes with milk tea.   The food is good except that the rice is uncooked. The milk tea tasted a bit off, unlike the one I usually had back in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"I was there ordered Duck Noodle soup and Gai Lan. Then eating half way, there was a huge Cockroach in my soup. I told them about it, they did brought me a new bowl. But at the end, they made me to pay for the Gai Lan. They said there was no Cockroach in the Gai Lan. I have never eaten at that place ever since."}
{"text":"We went here after playing badminton with a group of people since they were in the mood for Chinese BBQ.   We got the half free range chicken. Which was very tasty and came with a generous amount of ginger and green onion sauce/dipping. Price was a little much for the chicken but it is decent quality.  Also ordered the salty fish and diced chicken fried rice. I was slightly disappointed that the fish wasn't salty, it's what makes the dish unique and flavorful. The eggs and chicken were tender and cooked just right. Reasonable portion size for the price, good for splitting between two people (along side the chicken).   A person in our group ordered the shrimp and BBQ pork Shanghai noodles, his food came out really quickly but was made incorrectly (it had chicken) so it was sent back. The restaurant was busy but not overly so. 2 other people joined our dining group not long after that and their food was brought out long before this person's Shanghai noodles came out again. Pretty much half the group finished their meal at this pointed. A bit disappointed at the service and the so so foods at reasonable prices (depending on what you get)"}
{"text":"I love this place. This is probably one of my all time favorite spot to come eat in china town. Great place for eating during the day and at night time. Affordable and good quality meals. I usually get the triple meat combination with rice. It's the best!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place if you want good and affordable comfort food. You come here for a quick bite and head on to the rest of your day.  It's exactly what you would expect for a BBQ restaurant in C-town; fast service, cheap, and good enough quality to have you satisfied. Just don't expect anything over the top in terms of service or cleanliness -- that's not what you come here for."}
{"text":"I really love this place, it's an alltime favourite. It's also pretty cheap, if you know what to get. Some of the dishes (ex: bbq pork with rice) match the price. Non-expensive dish=small serving.  However, I usually go there and order the $4.75 noodles (#10) from the very back of the menu book. I find it worth the money and it's my favourite dish! They give you a decent amount of noodles mixed with pickled vegetables and ground beef. It's sweet and spicy, and also very hidden in the menu book. They take awhile to prepare it, since probably not many people order this, so they have to make it fresh.  All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with their service. It's a small business, and they're pretty fast."}
{"text":"The staff tried to sneak in a 10% tip into my bill without telling me which really pissed me off. In terms of food, it is cheap but also mediocre. Also, their timing is way off. Half of my dishes arrived on time while the other half came after my bill arrived."}
{"text":"I went to buy takeout crispy roasted pork and the guy gave me several pounds of pure fat.   I didn't notice until I got home but to me that deserves a 1 star.  I'm sure their set meals are good and reasonably good but I'm personally never going back there on my own initiative.   I didn't speak Cantonese so not sure if that was a factor."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!    Ok, so it's not the King's Noodle, but it's a few steps south, it looks the same on the inside, and they serve very similar BBQ duck and pork.  This is a very consistent place, with efficient (but cold) service, and lots of options for the sweet or salty tooth. Try meat on rice, or meat on noodles, or, well, seafood or vegetables. It's really mostly the same. Most things are covered in soy sauce anyway.  There's nothing special about these places, but for most Canadians, the flavours and textures are a treat. I really do like a big noodle soup covered in BBQ pork, and the prices ($5-10 for most entrees) are hard to beat.  I recommend the King's Noodle just up the street, but this place is fine too.  3 stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for 1:30am munchies when my friends and I are running the streets of Toronto all night. Actually, I don't believe I've ever been here before midnight. The ladies that work here are literally the best, always so friendly and obliging.  We often end up ordering a whole bunch of dumplings and the food is always tasty, hot, and fresh but what really makes this place the only option for us is the service."}
{"text":"This place....Er... Well,food is ok,But service was way too stupid .And I ain't coming back if was no necessary ."}
{"text":"Goldstone has been a personal favourite of mine for 10 years since I moved to Toronto. This is standard Cantonese done with authenticity, while being well-priced. Their BBQ duck and pork are great, as are their beef rice noodles, and congee, and won-ton soup noodles. Don't expect to be treated like a king, but do expect no-nonsense service, which is fine by me.  People who rave about King Noodle really don't know what they are talking about - this is the real deal! As with most restaurants in China town - I wish they'd make their facilities cleaner, but if you've been to Hong Kong, this really is a piece of the Orient in down-town Toronto. I will inevitably return!"}
{"text":"Ordered the dumpling and beef stomach with noodles for lunch  Gai Lan was crisp  Dumpling was good  Noodles were fresh Beef stomach was soft and not chewy   Overall pretty good, haven't really tried anything else"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves half a star but since I can't put half on Yelp 1 will do.   On lunch break from work today and I decided to stop by for food. I used to enjoy eating here until today when I found a PUBIC hair in my food (#83) half way into eating my soup. It's gross when you find a fly or an actual strand of hair but when you get a thick, curly pub in your soup. I honestly wish I had my phone with me to take a picture. So nasty, I went back to work and felt nauseous thinking about it.   Also I put the hair aside and left and as I was leaving the waitress cleaned the table and payed no attention to the hair. Is this normal for the staff to see pubic hair in the food?!   Goodbye goldstone. I'm never coming back"}
{"text":"This is a great place for wonton noodle soup.  The wontons are flavorful and the BBQs are out of this world.  The congee is also good too with their fried doughnut.  A must try."}
{"text":"Great duck soup"}
{"text":"The food here is amazingly bland and mediocre. The decor makes hospitals seem warm and welcoming. The cleanliness... well, let's just say there are furry residents in the back kitchen.   Years ago it was a dependable place to stop in for a quick bite when in Chinatown. I have obviously not warned enough people because two friends were food poisoned there last year.   I would give this a 0 star if I could."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 7/10 Food: 7/10 Atmosphere: 6/10 Service: 7/10  I'll keep this review short and simple, just like your experience will probably be at Goldstone on Spadina. A no frills Chinese spot in the middle of Chinatown, you'll find a huge menu and usual Chinese service.   The food is okay, pretty consistent across the board in terms of quality. It's neither amazing nor bad but if you're looking to satisfy a Chinese craving, it will do the job.   Service and everything else is so old school Chinese. They pull trolleys of dishes that fill the restaurant with their rattling right past you, and are not hesitant to carry the fully intact BBQ pig from the back to the front.   THE BOTTOM LINE: standard Chinese fare with old school service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok noodle house that I wandered by walking down Spadina.   I saw it was pretty full so I stopped in for a bite.  I ordered a bowl of noodles with beef brisket and a deep fried piece of dough.  The dough tasted like it just came out of the fryer which was awesome!  The noodles and brisket were solid.  The place is pretty clean for something on Spadina, yes I just went there and the place looks somewhat newer vs some other older establishments.  The staff sucks though after you place an order but if you're looking for quick and cheap food you can definitely swing by this place for something fast and solid tasting.  If you're in a rush just walk up to the cashier to pay."}
{"text":"Spicy salty deep fried squid is great. Another must have is the roasted pork with the delicious crackling. Oh and this place is cash only. No debit or credit."}
{"text":"I've past by this place on numerous occasions and it's always busy.  Last monday decided to try it with DH who had a doctors appt. a few doors away.    The order was BBQ pork noodle soup $4.25, steamed chinese broccoli with oyster sauce $4.50 and two kinds of BBQ (duck/soya chicken on rice) $8.50. One Bud one Pop $26 plus tip.  The noodle soup is the best deal here and I would stay with that if i ever go back.  Most of them are in the $4.25 - $6.25 range (seafood).  Ample noodles, tasty broth not overly salty.  A few pieces of baby bok choy, the skinnier egg noodles.    The Chinese Broccoli was watery on the plate which watered down the oyster sauce.  Not worth even the cheap price of $4.50.    For a BBQ house the duck and soya chicken were over cooked.  The skin on the duck was rubbery and the count on plate was not there.  However if you ordered it in the noodle soup the count was bigger and I'm sure the broth infuses the dryness.  The BBQ pork that was in the noodle soup was very tender and moist.  Very good.    Service was consistent considering they were quite busy and only two wait staff on.  Maybe try again and just have soup w/BBQ.  NOTE: cash only"}
{"text":"The service here is unbelievably.....poor. I am not opposed to thumb soup (are trays that expensive?) but even if I disregard that factor and omit dishes with soup I am sadly disappointed with the service. I do not like getting my bill when my dishes are not even half-emptied. If they prefer take out service, I don't see what's stopping them from turning into a place that only does delivery and take out where everything is about speed. I enjoy their menu in that you can order a variety of small items and share with your group. That's the main attraction about these Chinese noodle houses, no? I am rating them 2 stars is because of one bad experience which is all it really takes for me. I have switched to King Noodle since this one time. My family enjoys eating barbecued meats of this type every so often; let's say at least once a month. My mother-in-law went to pick up two ducks for me when I had a bad craving (not all for me, just 1.5 - lol). She selected the two ducks she felt were the best and pointed them out the butcher. He advised her they were two hot for him to cut up, so he grabbed another two. She doesn't speak English (I doubt he did either) but pointed again. He started cutting the two he selected and she came home unhappy. I ended more unhappy because the ducks were past the verge of going bad and had the smell of unsafe meat. Switched to King's Noodle since and haven't had a problem.  Still giving two stars because out of so many dining experiences, I've only had this one issue."}
{"text":"If you order the beef brisket noodle you always get more tendon than brisket and the latter tends to be less flavorful than other briskets I've had. It's not the worst, but could be better. I'm not a big fan of tendon so I don't mind a few bites but too much of it seems like you're putting a bunch of fatty beef flavored jello in your mouth.  tldr: the beef brisket here is inconsistent."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday evening for just a bowl of congee. I've been here before when I was much younger, and recall my parents always giving it rave reviews.  I was seated fairly quickly as the restaurant was about a quarter full. It was roughly 9pm. I ordered a bowl of congee, but the lady there said I had to order more because the minimum was $5. They had a handful of items on the menu that was under $5, and ordering another dish for myself would just be too much so I ordered a lemon tea. Don't see why they should price things under $5 if they aren't going to sell just that one dish to a customer.   My lemon tea came, and the waitress also placed a plate of fried beef noodles onto my table; I told her that it wasn't my order so she went back to check and was almost insistent that I ordered this. If I had ordered that my bill would already be over $5, I would not have had to order a drink on the side... they finally realized that order belonged to the table across from me and left. I was left with my lemon tea and no congee for awhile. When the congee did come out, it was whatever; anyone could cook it better at home. They mixed the congee with too much flour to make it look thick, but after about 5 minutes you will start to see it turn very watery. What turned me off the most was that the congee tasted like it would spoil very soon. The pork used in the congee did not taste fresh.  Besides the BBQ hanging in the front, which looked pretty decent, I most likely would not want to dine in this restaurant again. Customer service is horrid, and the food was nothing special even if all I did order was congee. But if they could screw up congee that badly, then how much better can there other dishes be?"}
{"text":"Sometimes, this restaurant reminds me of my highschool relationships.  One minute I hate you, the next, I can't get enough.  After my disappointing reviews I didn't return for a few years until I had some out of town guests ask me to meet there since it was late and there was nothing left open around.  I would say they've turned around and the food is back to how I remembered it.  I like how their food comes out and it's pretty standard fair - nothing extraordinary.  I am happy, for now."}
{"text":"I love this place for the bright sunny interior. The food was OK - tried a rather strange deep fried turnip dish. The portions are huge, so if you're not too hungry, I suggest ordering a bunch of items of the snack menu."}
{"text":"Having visited late night and then again recently during the busy lunch hour this place lands in the middle for me.  The only dish I really go here for is the duck which is really good, usually i have a rule to not eat the skin but damn it is so tasty here!   Me and a friend ate here late night before and I guess it just being because of the time the rice was super dry.  The second time round i just ordered half a duck without the rice and it was great."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? (?) ?????????"}
{"text":"Was excited for the rice pot which is at a very attractive price of $6.95. I got the black bean sauce with chicken, Chinese sausage and kailan on rice.  It didn't come with the sweet soy sauce but with another kind of sauce, which was still nice. There wasn't any of that sticky hardened rice at the bottom, so the pot definitely was not heated at a high enough temperature :( However, the sausage was good (but this never can be messed up) and the chicken was delicious and silky smooth! There was a good amount of the gai lan as well.   Will come back for their meats next time, really wanted to have the roast pork -- the skin looked so darn crispy!   Service is mediocre, hard to get the servers' attention.   Cash only."}
{"text":"L'un des restos ouverts la nuit à Chinatown. Autant dire que si vous avez l'estomac dans les talons après une soirée arrosée c'est l'endroit idéal pour déguster une soupe de nouilles au canard laqué (miom!). Le service est efficace et compréhensif malgré l'heure tardive. Les portions servies sont énormes donc n'hésitez pas à demander des box à emporter! Attention : paiement en liquide uniquement, mais pas d'inquiétude il y a une TD en face.  One of the restaurants in Chinatown opened by night. So if you are hungry after a nice party this is the place to go to get you fix (for me that would be the noodle soup with roasted duck, yumiiii). Staff is quick and efficient despite the late hour. Portions are huge so do not hesitate to ask for a box to go. PS : cash only people, so there is a TD just on the other side of the street."}
{"text":"Goldstone looks the same as 10 years ago. Quick and fast Chinese food.  Had the Singapore noodles and fried rice. Also got the salted pepper porkchops which was amazing.  Perfect amount of spiced to it for me.  Place was pretty busy as usual.  Decor hasn't changed much and place is still pretty dirty.  The washroom is downstairs as well."}
{"text":"The Good: It is definitely authentic Chinese food with a large variety to choose from. They've been open for years and still pull in lots of customers during the weekends. All the classics are on the menu and I was very happy with the Bird's Nest Black Bean Beef Chow Mein. Crunchy goodness and there was lots of beef.   High ceilings and bright lighting with big windows makes it a comfortable place to sit in.    The Bad: Smells like bleach especially when you go downstairs to the washrooms. I understand and am even glad that they make an effort to have a clean resto, but really, does my nose want to be attached by the scent of Clorax right before I'm planning to eat?  Had to ask for glass of water twice. They weren't busy at all so that's not something that I'll overlook.    The Overall: It's good for the price considering how big the portions are.   Revisit: It was 7 years since I last came here. Mostly because there are many other places that are worth trying downtown and there are definitely much better ones up in Markham. I probably wouldn't come back unless I had a major hankering for Chinese food. There's just too many other places that stand out for lunch/dinner choices."}
{"text":"Place is the bomb! Definitely recommend for a good cheap eat"}
{"text":"Last Sunday, I ordered Shrimp Fried Noddle and Fish Congee to go for 20$-that's a lot for just 2 dishes from a Chinese restaurant. I was totally disappointed when I opened the food. There were just a couple of shrimps in my noddle, and lots of sprout with clammy noddle. Otherwise, the Congee was OK, but the portion was little-just enough for 2 small bowls. Generally, I gonna give it between 2 and 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food here is very delicious, from the fried dough fritters to BBQ to noodle soups. The service could be a bit better, but I myself could never argue with such ready-available delicious food."}
{"text":"Not very clean environment, food is also below average level. I tried shrimp ChangFen, turnip pudding and congee, and maybe only recommend try congee. Will not go again."}
{"text":"We've enjoyed their food in the past. During this trip to Toronto, we were hesitant to come in, only because we had our stroller, on the bulky side, and our toddler, and we knew it was a fast-paced restaurant (we weren't sure if it would be child-friendly). Luckily, as we entered, they  showed us a side room where we could park the stroller and they already had a booster chair in hand and they attached it to the seat for us (a clean booster seat with safety straps too?!) all within three minutes of us walking in the restaurant. Service was super quick and food arrived right away. We ordered the BBQ pork over rice (so delicious!), broiled chicken with ginger (ok) and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce and garlic (good but too much garlic that wasn't cooked long enough). And of course the Hong Kong style milk tea, which we love. Overall, quite happy with our meal.  We returned for take out another evening.  More BBQ pork (still delicious), more Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (better this time) and chicken, mushroom and vegetable chow mein (very good!!).  Everything was ready within minutes except the chow mein, which took some time.   We would absolutely return.  Note:  Cash only."}
{"text":"Being one of the busier joints in the middle of the night, near entertainment district, and needing some chinese food to get by for the night, we came here. Not hard to find, cause it's right on Spadina, this place definately caters to the after the club crowd. They know how to shift tables together if you got a party of more than 4, so definitely accomodating for you and your crew!  The bbq pork that we ordered was pretty good, and they knew to add just enough sauce on top, and not over-drench it. The scallop fried rice was a little bland, luckily the bbq pork was flavourful for a good mix.  I guess you cannot ask for too much in a wonton mein joint in Chinatown, but the quality, well at least the night we were there, was ok."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! I have lots of dishes I like to eat there. The staff are always nice and accommodating. CASH ONLY business."}
{"text":"It's not good food.  but they have really good cha siu that you can take out- nice and fatty- good cuts of bbq pork that is worth it for 3 stars. eating in isn't fabulous.  I still maintain that asian legend is the only chinese restaurant in chinatown, or in toronto proper, that is worth going to. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/asian-legend-toronto"}
{"text":"I love this place for late night congee or BBQ take out. When they're open, they're open late (closed on Tuesdays). I've never eaten at the restaurant so I can't speak for that. But when I come here to get congee takeout, I'm in and out in 5 mins. I like their congee much better than other places in the area, where it's made too watery.   The food is cheap and it's cash only. Don't expect to be pampered by good service - these Chinese restaurants are all about getting your food to you fast and efficiently at a cheap price.   Their BBQ is pretty good too and the portion sizes are quite generous. Come in and order a BBQ pork on rice and you'll have enough leftovers for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"This is the place in Chinatown I come to get my meals. Nothing to fancy but good consistent food. Even the Portuguese baked dishes here are delicious and I come from eating uptown ones :D Recommend if you want good Chinese eats"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after going doing improv with Asiansploitation, which was just around the corner. It's a typical downtown Asian food place, so don't have your expectations too high. Food wasn't bad, but nothing special either. If you want a quick bite with a group of people, price won't go too high.   We order a an Indonesian fried rice, which was covered in friend stirred up fried egg and broccoli on the side. It was one of the better dishes I had there. The seafood noodles dish and barbeque pork was alright, but was a bit small by my standards.    If you happen to be around, don't want to look for a place, and don't want to spend too much money, it's just an A-OK place to stop by."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before touring the rest of Chinatown.  I ordered the rice noodle roll with shrimp and shrimp wonton soup. The wonton soup was light and very tasty. That could've been a meal in itself for me. The rice noodle roll was made with too much flour and wasn't as enjoyable for me.  Prices, portions, and service were good."}
{"text":"Decent place to get some late night chinese food (open til 2am on friday nights). Ordered the BBQ duck and Wonton Noodle Soup. The wontons were really good - nice size, full shrimps inside, good flavour. Noodles also fine. Only thing was the BBQ duck which was super fatty. Most of the duck in my bowl was actually skin/fat...not much meat. Won't order the duck again (or if I do, I'll pay the premium for the duck leg which is supposed to be less fatty).   I wouldn't mind coming back to try their hk style noodle soup which includes beef and fish balls, wontons, beef tendon, tripe. Sounds like awesomeness in a bowl."}
{"text":"One of my new faves for quick, inexpensive Cantonese-style Chinese food. Better than Kings Noodle, just up Spadina.  I tried congee here for the first time...a bit bland for my tastes, but that's congee.  Anything they make with bbq pork is amazing, also, the duck.  On my second visit, did takeout....super-cheap, fast bbq platter on rice.   Washrooms pretty clean by area standards.   Only warning is it's cash only."}
{"text":"The Gold Stone Noodle Restaurant situated in the heart of Toronto's Chinatown is my favorite stop for won tons and Chinese soup noodle dishes.  Toronto gets pretty darn cold during the winter months and usually that is the time of the year when I visit most; a big bowl of hot noodle soup is exactly what is needed to warm me up.  The ingredients are fresh and usually very well seasoned.  The food is inexpensive, the portions are large and the service is usually very good. In addition to their popular noodle dishes they also have very good Chinese BBQ.  The restaurant can get quite busy, crowded and loud during the afternoon hours, but wait times are usually pretty short."}
{"text":"Food was ok for the price. And food was brought out quick , which is good if you are pressed for time. Good amounts too. There nothing to complain about, but nothing to praise either."}
{"text":"What more do you want for $9 for two people.   Typical Cantonese street food in the heart of Toronto. Great for late night eats and a quick meal.    One of my favourite things to order are the Rice Noodles with Dough Stick filling (Tsaa Leung). For some reason the dough stick is crunchy (and not soggy) but has a thin rice noodle roll layer. I can eat this whole thing myself.   Boyfriend and I shared also a BBQ duck noodle soup. Simple, and tasty. Portion size it's good for one person if you don't order anything else.   If I was trying to find typical chinese food in chinatown, this is the place I will go to."}
{"text":"My family and friends have been dropping by to this restaurant for a long while.  (15 years...I grew up eating their now discontinued children's meal - steak + fries + ice cream.  Yum, although, that's probably why I'm fat...)  So far so good, their bbq pork is pretty good (not too sweet nor charred), and their congee is always good.  However, the service has turned abysmal.  My father and I dropped by today (on Father's Day), and the atmosphere was pretty rough.  One, the owner's daughter kept yelling in Cantonese to the waitstaff and kitchen staff to hurry up and serve the customers.  Two, the waitstaff was pretty much dead on their feet, and wanted to hurry us out of our seats.  (Granted, that's pretty normal for Father's Day, but the atmosphere contributed to the \"get the hell out of Dodge\" mood.)  I've been to roadside eateries in Hong Kong, and even then, the service has been much better.  Granted, my family and friends will probably head back here.  Hopefully, it's just a one-off thing on \"special holidays\".  *  The owner's daughter is physically disabled and cannot easily move, but that does not entail shouting at the staff from the other side of the store."}
{"text":"For the Hong Kong-style fast food joints in Chinatown, this place is a cut below King's Noodles and Swatow, but better than House of Gourmet on Dundas. Service is suspect and for whatever reason, there's always a dirty plumbing stench emanating from the steps to the basement washroom when I'm there. Then again, this is old Spadina..."}
{"text":"Seriously?  This place is great... Best sweet & sour pork with Shanghai noodles EVER, AND the portions are HUGE!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a solid noodle house but has really declined over the past 3 years. Stick with the wonton mein and ignore the flies."}
{"text":"Favourite takeout place! The employees here are as nice as any HK Cafe style restaurant can be. Food is priced very reasonably and have a large variety. I have ordered the $4.50 bowl with rice, soya sauce chicken and vegetables. It was delicious!!! I've also ordered a whole soya sauce chicken ($14) and it was MASSIVE and could feel me for a week.   Cash only!"}
{"text":"i was on a hunt for cha siu bao, and stopped in a few places but should have know the one i parked across the street from was going to have it instead of walking up and down. service questionable unless you know the language. we walked in she seated us and just gave use menus, and forks ((we left those where she put them, if i asked if she had cha siu bao before opening the menu it should have been a clue that we prob can use chopsticks perfectly fine)) we waited a while before she came back to us so we could order, but it only took a few min from ordering to get the food. and it was pretty good, we played it safe and got the beef in satay sauce, but for the $$ it was a great lunch."}
{"text":"A solid place to eat. They offer a good selection of dishes with a nice variety regardless of what you are hungry for. I had the opportunity to try the goldstone fried rice,e-fu noodle, har gow, and bbq duck. The fried rice was a unique with an egg wrap around the rice. The noodles and shrimp dumplings were both solid. The duck wasn't my favourite and was a tad pricey compared to the other dishes. Overall, it was a good meal, and not too expensive, I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Deep fried chicken wings are excellent. Their roast pork is very good.  The rice noodle rolls with bbq pork and shrimp are good.  We have been coming to Gold Stone for years and the quality has definitely gone down.  I used to get Cantonese Chow Main and it used to be good.  Last time I got it was awful."}
{"text":"Love the BBQ pork here! The roast pork is my second fave! The ginger and garlic sauce is an added bonus, they even let you buy some by the bottle if you want!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing   ! Non-tasty dishes  ! Weak and unhelpful service , but quick service ! Only cash accepted"}
{"text":"Good food fast is the best way I can describe Goldstone.    Was craving soy sauce chicken on rice like nobody's business so came to Goldstone knowing that I would get quality BBQ meats for a decent price.... and they didn't disappoint.  Also ordered Shanghai Noodles that tasted amazing.    My only complaint is that their rice is a bit too hard.  They need to add a bit more water to it.  Other than that this place is great if you like Chinese BBQ meats and want quick and fast food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food. Miserable service last 2 visits, yet kind of expected... Large interior, good corner location in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Go here because Kings Noodle is too busy.  BBQ Pork and Duck are good here so make sure you order one or both.  Also, I don't know what it is called (can't read the chinese names), but they do a good job with a dish that is a deep fried chinese doughnut wrapped in rice noodle and served with a sesame-peanut sauce.  I have this anywhere it is served and here is a great place to get it."}
{"text":"Well I can honestly say I've had the worse food in Toronto, after living in China for 6 years, I would be surprised if anyone ever eats here, the oyster sauce was expired, the vegetables tasted like they came out of the garbage, the Hong Kong style milk tea tasted like hot sugar water and the Xaio long bao was dry with no flavor or juice inside, overall horrible food quality, I could go on but, the service was just as bad as the food. Never again. - 10"}
{"text":"The food is really good. The Shanghai dumplings are delicious and affordable.   The service is fast and efficient.   I definitively recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at 6pm with 10 other friends.  Restaurant was 60% full and was able to get sits in a few minutes.  Restaurant is more like an old style Chinese restaurant where the decor was basic and the service is not really friendly.  I got the wonton noodle soup and corn soup with chicken & fake crab meat.  The wonton soup was a good. There were 5 medium sized wontons that contained about 50% pork and 50% shrimp. The corn soup was bland and I needed to add lots of condiments to give it more flavour.  Portion sizes were good for both bowls.    Will definitely be back for some more wonton soup in the future."}
{"text":"Goldstone is a pillar in Chinatown along with King's Noodles.  It has been here forever.  I tried the Hainan chicken rice dish here before.  I enjoyed it.  This time I tried the stir fry beef rice noodles with black bean sauce.  The dish also consisted of onions, bell peppers & carrots.  I found this dish just ok.  I have had better at other places."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent meal with assorted bbq selections at reasonable prices, this may be a good place to try.  Do not expect friendly service, but expect to get your requests fulfilled after one (or two) reminders to the servers.   Ordered a wonton noodle soup with roast pork and vegetable. Overall a decent quick small meal. Roast pork was good, noodle and vegetable were typical. The wonton was filled with pork and shrimp and was satisfactory but not great."}
{"text":"My favourite Hong Kong style cafe on Spadina! During my 3 week stay in downtown Toronto, this was my go to place for a quick, inexpensive, yet tasty meal. For a little under $5, you can get a big bowl of soya chicken (or another BBQ item) over rice. Similar to many cha chaan tengs, there's also different specials that run throughout the day. While I have tried a number of items on the menu, I find their BBQ selection to be the most delicious.  I definitely missed this place when I moved uptown to North York!"}
{"text":"The funniest thing - they have one of these in Vancouver too - and it's a nostalgic fan favourite.  It's what you except - curt, efficient service, cheap meals and uninviting atmosphere.  You get your fill on and move on.  I had a BBQ pork in noodle soup - a steal for $4.75.  Unfortunately, we also ordered plain congee, donut fritter and some veggie stirfry.  Veggie stirfry was pretty meh - and the donut fritter was stale.  Bleh.  The HK milk tea/coffee I had to wash down this mediocrity... was also mediocre.  But it's pretty much what you expect."}
{"text":"To be fair, this place is not a great place for any \"social\" meals, not even with friends if you want a nice environment that can stimulate the vibe. This is a place for fast and cheap Chinese food. Most dishes are around $9-14, and they send your meal to you very quick. Compare to other similar kind of Chinese restaurant, I would say this place is really good. At least, the staff are not rude and their food is great! My favorite are their roasted pork and tomato sauce baked pork chop rice."}
{"text":"As my friends & I walked inside, I told them that this place's way too clean to serve really good Chinese food lol... And I was right, the food here's just decent.  You can get noodle soup anywhere from $4 - $6, which's pretty cheap. I got their Black Pepper Beef with Rice ($8sh). It's actually decently good, I like the black pepper sauce. The portion's also very acceptable given the price.  Overall - The food price & portion are pretty good. The dishes're authentic Chinese food, but they're just ok in term of flavor. Just like most Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, the service's crap. They'll only pay attention to you when you're about to pay the check lol..."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot for cheap, Hong Kong style Chinese food. The noodles with BBQ pork are a go-to favourite. Don't expect much for service -- it's part of the HK vibe."}
{"text":"this place is great because it's open late and that's about it.  the service is quick, so quick that before my chopsticks leave my mouth, we have the bill.  alright, i'm kidding about that, but not by much.  we got the bill about halfway through the meal.  this makes me feel like they don't appreciate my business.  there were a bunch of us and we ordered a lot of dishes.  i was surprised at how fast the food came out.  i think this is due to the fact that they save on cooking time by not putting any spices in the food.  i will admit, when you've had a few drinks and it's late and you're hungry and it comes out quick...it'll do.  if nothing else is open that late, go here."}
{"text":"Haven't been very much the last few years - it's pretty good but wouldn't go out of my way for it - used to stop in a couple of times a month between 2002-08 when I was in the area at night more often.  I give them the 4th star strictly for being open late  and service being good even on very long & busy nights, otherwise would be a 3.   The safe bets are the noodle soups - Wonton, Tendon, Brisket, or anything with BBQ or Duck in it - slightly on the salty side at times but not to the point of unpleasantness.  I most often go with the Tendon & Noodle.  Rice dishes with BBQ Pork are satisfying, as are Duck or SoySauce Chicken although sometimes the birds are small & a little \"boney\". Singapore Noodles & Blackbean Chicken is OK & good size for the price.  It's a good value considering hours, price & convenience - I can usually find parking on the sidestreet immediately to the west. They're fairly clean considering the traffic  - when you ask for exta bowl or plate it's always perfectly washed & rinsed (that's a good way to judge a places cleaning diligence...).  The downsides are somewhat uncomfortable seating (booths are tough fit for a bigger person...) The Washrooms are OK by Chinatown standards but they're in the basement and the stairs are extremely steep with tall steps so it could definitely be a problem for anyone with mobility issues or who's been drinking too much."}
{"text":"\"Being from NY, I've had my fair share experience of dirty food... but needless to say, I found a fly in my noodle soup.\"  My family and I are from New York so we're staying in Canada for vacation this week.  Here, we're staying with family who lives a couple of blocks away from Chinatown. We went to visit the CN Tower earlier during the day and since night has fallen and it was raining out, we decided to opt for something close by our family's place before heading home. We were gonna stop for some pho but the prices seemed high compare to what we'd pay for back in NY. So we stopped Goldstone Noodle since it seemed pretty busy at 9:45 pm, we thought, it must be at least decent.  I was in a party of 6 and we each put in our own orders, I ordered the Steam Chicken Thick Noodle Soup. All the other food had came and my family seem okay with it and me being in starving mode, immediately dug in upon receiving my noddle. The broth wasn't the best and most flavor-able but that didn't bother me and the steam chicken was good. Upon 3/4 of being done with my meal, as I had just taken in a mouthful of noodles, a small black shape floated to the top of my broth. A closer examination, it was a fly... I kid you not, a not-too-tiny but not-yet-full-size fly floated into my view. Upon seeing the fly, I lost my appetite. I told the waiter and she politely apologized and I understood, I mean, it wasn't her fault. She offered to credit my order back and we accept the offer but was a little unsatisfied. I thought for an incident like this, we should of had our whole table taken care of, if not at least a certain percent off the final check.... Needless to say, we probably won't be coming back here but we still left a decent tip. =/"}
{"text":"Quality of food has gone really downhill. My family and I used to come here for years and their wonton soup was the best in the city in our opinion. Went there yesterday after we were craving some wonton soup and duck and wow has everything changed.  We drove almost an hour but we didn't mind because of how much we loved the food. The wonton soup is not as flavourful, the duck is okay but had to be reheated 4 times ! Also we got this unclean feeling. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Omg what happened to this restaurant?  I've been visiting them for over 15 years when I lived midtown.  How can a Chinese place messed up deep fried dough and steamed vegetable with oyster sauce?! The deep fried dough was waaaay under cooked, and the veggie was waaaay over cooked.  After ordered deep fried dough, I witnessed the chef sampled a piece himself with a questionable look on his face, but he still served it!!! Its so soft and not fresh, we asked to exchange. Instead of making a fresh one, they looked thru the entire piles of precooked ones and picked one they think was ok too serve.  It was such a disgusting and unpleasant experience. Will never go back."}
{"text":"holy mudda bullshit it's HOT in there.  i definitely wouldn't recommend going there in the summer. no a/c and hot foods are not a good thing. my eyes were sweating.   anyways, The congee was good but damn it was HOT. It burned my tongue lol. The other foods lacked flavour and were quite bland. Or maybe the congee just burned off all my taste buds.   The selection is large so I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to eat. I honestly don't even remember all the foods I ate but I just know that they were hot and flavourless.   The servers were quite rude and barely said a word to the other customers (especially the Caucasians). I guess they only talk if you can speak Mandarin or Cantonese. I ain't complaining though because some of them spoke Vietnamese and my mom was able to talk to them. It's just a heads up for the guai lou.   I recommend going in the winter!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried their lunch special to-go for the first time. I ordered my favorite dish, hoi nan chicken with rice. I like that the lunch special also includes a hot milk tea (for cold u have to pay more).  Taste: good, but I do wish they had the green onion & ginger sauce   Portion: waaaaay too much rice for the amount (which was kinda small) of chicken rec'd  Price: Decent, although it's a little higher than some other places (maybe it's due to this location)  Overall, I'd go back for take out only."}
{"text":"Good day affordable. Average Cantonese style noodle house with extensive selections. For 8 bucks, my noodle was loaded with all ingredients: beef, beef tendon, wonton, fish balls... the pancake was very good, but you start feel like drinking something after several bites. Not because of seasoning but the ingredients in it. The soup was okay.   In general, this is a Chinese place to have quick meal with lower cost."}
{"text":"First, watch the guy from the window outside cook up some jook and wonton mein. Wow, what technique and precision. Now go in and order some em dat!  My meal on a rainy Thursday night here was memorable because the place was not crowded and I took my sweet time sampling the old school cooking over several refills of hot tea.  The pork kidney jook was fantastic as it was scalding hot with chopped green onion and julienned ginger garnish.  The siu gow (wonton variation) dumpling noodle soup was as hot and rock solid as they come.   The BBQ plate of roast pork and soy sauce chicken leg was executed at as high a level and high quality as any BBQ joint that's been doing it for decades."}
{"text":"I've eaten a couple of times here - their noodles have always been pretty passable, and the price has always been very reasonable. Not the best you're going to get in Chinatown, but not the worst either.   This may sound cynical, but I don't really understand why restaurants have open kitchens where people from the outside, who aren't in the restaurant, can see in. Nothing good will come out of that.   My friend and I were walking down Spadina to get some noodles, and saw a lady preparing noodles through the window. We're big ramen fans and food voyeurists so we stopped, drooling, to watch her fill bowls for a bit before we headed inside to get food. She was up against the window, about two feet away from us on the other side of the glass. She returned with a prepared bowl of ramen (let's call this bowl #1) filled with what looked like chicken stock and yellow noodles.  We watched in increasing horror was she grabbed another bowl (bowl #2), filled it with a different kind of noodles, and proceeded to pour all of the broth from bowl #1 into bowl #2. Then, with a pair of chopsticks, she one by one transferred all the toppings (bok choy, meat slices) from bowl #1 to bowl #2. The only thing left in bowl #1 at this point were the noodles; she put a different soup stock into bowl #1, with different toppings but over the exact same noodles, and took both bowls out to be re-served. It seems kind of evident that they must have gotten an order wrong or something and as a result the customer had sent the bowl of noodles back, but instead of throwing it out and making a new bowl, they just recycled everything.  This was all a little awkward for us to watch - especially since she was at the counter right up the window that faced the street and we were watching her the entire time. We opted for a different noodle place."}
{"text":"Fast service, the noodles seemed low quality and the waitress messed up our orders several times. Would recommend the noodles with Szechuan sauce and the Peking duck and roasted pork, other than that the selection was fairly bland."}
{"text":"This place isn't going anywhere. It's tasty, quick, and cheap. It also has everything. I find myself gravitating to this place when I'm in the area.   So why 3 stars? It's definitely not 5 star quality food, and I would've given it a 4, but the service isn't really great either.   It's like a restaurant that knows it'll do fine regardless so they don't really care about the customer experience, which in a way is true.   If you haven't been, try it out. Then come back for cravings like I do from time to time."}
{"text":"Their BBQ pork and steamed chicken is good.  So are their prices, they service and other meats are not that great in my opinion.  I love going there but refuse to try other things, every time I have attempted to I have been very disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for consistent food, this is the place to go. It's my regular lunch spot, but always call in advance for pickup. Food has always been ready on time.   FYI: Closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This place gets crowded but for a reason. Real good Chinese food. Not your Panda Express nor a nasty PF Chang's. A real spot where the food is prepared as you walk in. Service is crappy but it's because they're busy. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the owner is very rude. Food is more expensive than the other places in Chinatown and they give you very small portions. They give you the bill before you even ask for it or before you even finish eating letting you know to eat fast and leave, they need the table for the next customers. Back to the owner she screamed at a poor fellow for splitting the bill with his friend. She yelled at him saying he should have told the waitress ahead of time which means before he even knew they would be putting his bill on the table before he finished eating. He was too embarrassed to say anything so he just paid the total bill. My take out consists of a bbq duck which was raw on the inside and the owner insist that I wait while they microwave it. I could have done that myself at home instead of wasting my time bringing it back for them to make it right."}
{"text":"Good food, big selection, decent portion, great prices, opens late, nice and efficient staff.  Sometime they are so quick at serving and clearing up the dishes, I do feel rushed.  Not ideal for hanging out, but good Chinese \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I think it's about time for me to write a review. Each time I've eaten here the food tasted mediocre - the roast pork is especially salty more than normal. On top it all, the host is curt and very abrupt - it's hard to communicate with her as her accent is thick and she always seems occupied with something else. I've given this place a few times because it's a close friend's favourite. There are multiple other Chinese restaurants near by that offer better service and taste, for example Swatow, Noodle King, and House of Goumet"}
{"text":"Bbq pork is on point, great late night. Always have room to park illegally. You can see the parking police out the window so don't worry"}
{"text":"Ok, the thing is, their BBQ Pork on rice is just phenomenal. And apparently the secret is: 1. Get takeout 2. Call ahead  If you do this, you eliminate having to sit through their crappy service AND you don't have to tip for said crappy service.  My mom and I went to do pick up the other night and the food made me so happy. Not to mention how cheap it was. $5 for a bowl of bbq pork on rice is awesome."}
{"text":"Loved the BBQ pork noodle soup. It was only $4.35!  In addition to a generous portion of bbq pork, it came with boiled bok choy. Combined with light broth and thin but firm noodles, it was a surprisingly good experience for under $5."}
{"text":"It's been 2 years since I last reviewed Gold Stone and I decided it was time to give an update.  Interesting fact - Gold Stone was in the opening scene of the latest triple X movie staring Vin Diesel.  Today I ordered the hoi nam chicken with rice. At $7.25, you get a plate of boneless chicken (wow!!) with some bok choy, a huge plate of rice (nice chewy texture, though a bit on the hard side, and the rice could be more flavourful although there were ginger and some other spices in it, I just ate it with the ginger, scallion sauce), 2 sauces (one hot and spicy, the other is the green onion/ginger/scallion) and some vinegar infused carrots and radish. Oh, and this lunch special also comes with a hot drink, I got the HK-style tea. There was so much food that I had to take some home.  Gold Stone is always bustling at lunch time, and it never fails to deliver fast, cheap and filling entrees :)  Review from 2015:  This is my go-to place at lunch. Food is ok, cheap, and service is super fast. When you're done eating, you pay at the cashier. They have lunch specials (ho nam chicken with rice, bbq pork.on rice, etc.) at $7.95, and includes a drink (HK style tea or coffee). The congee is ok ($4.75) and they have a variety of noodle soups (beef brisket, pork chop) around the same price. Don't expect much from the decor or bathroom (down a steep flight of stairs) and service is so-so (they speak Cantonese, Mandarin, and English)."}
{"text":"Just so so. The Che zai mian tastes good! So does the Yuanyang and milk tea. The BBQ pork rib is so so"}
{"text":"Would come back again - especially post-late-night-Toronto excursions.  Goldstone's is open late late late, and it's got good food considering how late it stays open. It's a regular Chinese chop-house/BBQ restaurant where you can order the typical Chinese HK-style foods: BBQ pork rice, wonton noodle, fried rice etc.   Fast, efficient service.  Good drinks, good prices, open late - not spectacular, but overall... GOOD!  Would come back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of the restaurants you find in New York City's Chinatown. Very inconspicuous on the outside, but fairly large on the inside. The front of the restaurant is dedicated to takeout Chinese donuts and duck, with a kitchen in the back and plenty of seating in between. Most of the tables are setup for groups of 4. Groups of 8 or more will likely have to split up. Like most other Chinese restaurants, don't expect the waitresses to come to you. You'll need to get their attention.  We had a group of 5, so we had to move a table. That's when I noticed how dirty it is underneath the table. It's obvious that they don't move the tables around when they're mopping.  The food was decent. After perusing their giant menu, I ordered a bowl of BBQ pork noodle soup. There wasn't anything particularly special about it, except that it was ridiculously cheap ($4 and change).  Cash only."}
{"text":"A decent place for cantonese food. The jook is good. Just keep in mind it comes with an order of you-teeu (chinese donuts). You dont have to order them separately. I wish the waitress told me that. I had two orders of you teeu and not enough jook. I highly recommend for people to try the BBQ meat rice plates. Def worth the money. But I would skip the wonton noodles. The noodles were soggy when they arrived and the wontons were small. One more thing, I would suggest customers to be careful when they walk in. Tiles are super slippery. During a rainstorm, the place is like a slip n' slide. They really need to change the tiles or they're just asking for a lawsuit. Overall, a decent place to eat at."}
{"text":"OK! I thought the seats were bright red sofa seats.. and they are not. :p Dropped myself on the seat waiting for the soft cushion feel, but landed on wood ow.  Food is decent. Service is good and it is just nice place, but nothing stands out for me. Had no trouble getting seats so that was nice."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Price: Under 10 Service: 2/5 Cleanness: 2/5 Good place to a cheap eat and do not expect too much from service.  This place is the typical Hongkong style cafe which is cheap and good. I love the food here, especially BBQ pork and oil chicken. I usually order one whole chicken to go and it could feed me for a week. I came here for the lunch special sometimes, for around $9, I got a decent lunch. However, the service I got is really inconsistent. The waiters/waitresses are pretty busy, and sometimes it might take them to get to you."}
{"text":"Great for Chinese BBQ. Their BBQ Duck and Soy sauce chicken is  consistently one of the best in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"I'm from Where the Asians Live in the GTA (aka RIchmond Hill/Markham). I was raised on excellent and affordable Chinese barbecue and I crave roasted duck as well as crispy roasted pork every so often.  Now that my life is downtown, I still get that craving so I'd been looking for a new bbq place.  I'd walked by Goldstone many times and thought that their meats hanging in the window looked much better than a few other places downtown, so this was on my To Try list.  I came here for a quick lunch and got a duck/crispy pork bowl.  The serving was really, really small.  I mean, I knew it'd be smaller than a plate but there were only a few small pieces of each kind of meat.  It was TINY!  But it tasted good, so I thought I'd just order a plate next time.  But when the bill came I saw that my tiny bowl of rice with a few tiny squares of meat was over $8 after tax! $8+ for so little food! I get that it's downtown, but for that price I could eat much better at lunch in the middle of the financial district!  That was ridiculous.  So I asked one of the servers how much a plate would cost and she said $2 more.  But when I looked at the plates that were being prepared on my way out, I found that the rice plates had a lot more rice, but only about 4 more pieces of meat.    I think it's a total ripoff, so I'm going to keep looking for a new Chinese bbq place."}
{"text":"The roast duck is delicious, with the won ton being decent too. The chao mian with seafood was decent, even coming with some skillfully cooked scallops. However, the Xiao long bao (Chinese soup dumplings) contained negligible amounts of soup and the Chang fen (rice noodle roll) was really thick, so pass on those."}
