{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood. Friendly staff and patrons. Hard to not start up a conversation with someone else. Good food, great selection of beers and a big patio to boot!"}
{"text":"The service | Awesome. Super sweet staff and it really feels like you're at home. Cozy, unpretentious and chill. Kids made a bit of a mess (sorry!) and staff dealt with it without making us feel bad about it. My only suggestion is get some plastic sippy cups / plates for the wee ones (there were a few at the resto) to avoid damage expenses.  Beers | You wouldn't expect such variety at such a small place. And they have Beau's on tap!  The food | Really, really good. Our crew (2 dudes, all three kids, two 4-year-olds and a 20-month old, had fried chicken + waffles (because really, if it's on the menu, why wouldn't you?). I had \"the other salad\" + Popcorn sriracha chicken hearts with coconut curry glazed , all of which was delish (and I can still smell the curry on my fingers...mmmmmm).  We'll be back - for sure."}
{"text":"Great place in a great location.  Patio will be great in the summertime.  Killer Fried Green Tomato sandwich served with fries. Everyone keeps on mentioning the homemade ketchup and for good reason. Lots of good beers on tap. Nice selection of food on the menu. Targeting to try the Fish and Chips if I can convince myself to stop ordering the FGT sandwich.  Nice vibe....friendly staff....random good tunes.  Only downside is that it isn't located in my neighbourhood.  ."}
{"text":"I went here last week and was disappointed.  The fryer  oil was in desperate need of being changed the fish amd chips were heavily battered and the chicken & waffles were  hard and heavily coated in batter, it lacked  moisture and taste.  I was disappointed by the food but the saving grace was the  patio that had a nice vibe and the beer selection was notable."}
{"text":"Two words: Lamb Fries.  Perfection on a plate with good service and a great patio. It's worth the trip to Little India for this hidden gem."}
{"text":"A real hipster vibe here. The kind of place you would be least surprised to learn they chisel their own ice cubes for authenticity and texture. They don't actually chisel their ice cubes. But they do make their own ketchup. The chicken & waffles are superior.  The portions are perfect for mid-size females, but others should expect to order atleast an additional side to satisfy their hunger.  It will be interesting to see what happens to the patio here in the summer, as it's pretty much the only one of it's kind for like a 30 min walk.   OH! I forgot to mention! The suicide wings here are ACTUALLY suicide. I order the hottest option at pretty much any pub I goto, and it's nowhere near Eulalie's hottest option's hotness (*five times fast*). For me,  these are too hot."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Tasty, interesting food. Great beers. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great little pub with a good atmosphere.  The food is delicious, there's a fine selection of beer and the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Love Eulalies. Great addition to the hood. Great food especially tomato sandwich and chicken and waffles, and homemade ketchup."}
{"text":"This is a really cozy little local pub that has everything I love. Great beer list, warm but uncluttered decor, good music, friendly and efficient service, and food that haunts my dreams."}
{"text":"Adorable decor, friendly staff, excellent food and always a great selection of craft beer. Their wine list is actually pretty good for a little bar as well. Bartender with the knife tattoos is especially fantastic."}
{"text":"Tucked away just off Gerrard on a sidestreet, we had a great meal here. Eulalie's Corner Store...what an AWESOME surprise for dinner. Great atmosphere, superb food. Fab cocktail and beer list. I LOVED my Autumn 16 cocktail, and we both had outstanding burgers. The homemade ketchup is wonderful. There are so many things we want to try on the menu, we'll be back. Friendly service. Fair prices. A total winner."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood joint. The staff are friendly & the food is really good. I'm glad we finally have a decent little bar in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Ordered almost everything except for 4 dishes off their menu. Chicken and waffles and savory and spicy, the real blueberry compote with it complemented the dish without being overly sweet. Excellent fresh friend chips. Squash soup was perfect for a cold day. 5/5 would get a food coma again"}
{"text":"Was starving & decided to stop in. Pleasantly surprised. Food is a great fusion of western & eastern.  Tucked away in little India. Not what i expected but the food & drinks were amazing. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice little place with interesting food and beer selection"}
{"text":"Like a pub, but different enough to make your evening just a bit special.  A twist on foods so its intriguing but not funky."}
{"text":"Not sure why hipster spots attract essayist reviewers, but I'll try not to be too verbose in my comments.  A much needed cool local, with a much needed patio.  the bohemian chic, retro flea-market design is fun and fits the hood, the food is above average, and the service is good.    avoid the cocktails if you are looking for legit mixology."}
{"text":"Great menu. Had the tofu tacos and loved them! Great flavours and value. Love the service and ambience here."}
{"text":"What more could you ask for? Great ambiance, superb service, and outstanding food! The menu satisfies everyone's tastes, and all the sauces/dressings are homemade, including the ketchup. I had the kale Caesar salad with some chicken, and it was by far the best kale Caesar I've had. The chicken (add-on) was beautifully seasoned and cooked. My cousin got the nachos, which were generously topped with all kinds of goodies, including freshly prepared salsa and guacamole; let me just say, this 30+ year Arizonan was impressed with Eulalie's interpretation of this dish. My cousin's fiancee ordered some buffalo cauliflower for us all to share, and I was tempted to swipe it from the table to eat it by myself, it was that good! Our server, a sweet Irish gal, was very attentive, and happy to help us select beers, and to take our picture as well. I'm not too familiar wit Toronto's food scene, but being that this place is a block away from my cousin's business, I'm sure I'll find my way back here on future trips."}
{"text":"I am here on a google whim when I was starving. I was prepared to eat a horse as I forgot about lunch and went to Greenwood Park for a swim instead. You know how when you hang by a pool for a few hours, you work up a massive appetite even if all you did was bobble in the water and pretend not to listen to the loving couple near you have the most passive aggressive fight or the strangest foreplay EVER.  Scene:  A public pool at high noon on a hot July day. A skinny moon-tan white mid-30s hipster couple, the dude: a weak chin and lack of hipster beard makes him not quite hot, the girl: a sleeve tattoo with koi fish and a super fug spikey 80s haircut. Seriously, I have cousins in Kenora more edgy than these two. Here's my transcript:  SHE: That girl Anna, you totally slept with her that time you were working at BuhDiDooDigital... long red hair, really thin, naturally thin, very pretty...  HE: Hmmmm, no I don't know who you mean...  SHE: Yes! She looks a lot like the Polish girl who is the hostess at the Drake only she's not Polish.....skinny?  really pretty...  HE: Uhhhh, I'm not sure who you mean....  SHE: Yes, you know! Anna! Long! Red! Hair! Very! Pretty! Really! Skinny!   All the while she was chewing him out, like a manic fishwife, he was holding her effortlessly with his thin duke white arms like a baby because the water made her boney ass buoyant, and gently swirling her around in circles. I kept waiting for him to dunk her and say; \"Yes I remember Anna, I fucked her AND the Polish hostess. At the Drake. At the same time. We had a threesome. And I got pegged.\"   But no, instead he managed to change the subject and ask her where she wanted to go for dinner as he stroked her resting bitch face head like that hair washing scene in Out of Africa. WTF did I just witness? Either he is pussy whipped or a pussy whisperer....? He managed to divert her diggity dog questioning which could only lead to the diggity dog house and changed it all so he could get fed.  AND SHE SAID: Let's go to that pub on Ashdale across from the library, but I'm not eating the blahblahblah  AND HE SAID: We're going to need to have a talk about why you won't eat blahablahblah  And then she broke out of his embrace and swam away, like a defiant mermaid. I didn't hear the WHAT she won't eat but I did hear the WHERE, so I googled \"pub at Ashdale across from the library\" and I got Eulalie's Corner Store. Hipster vibe, said Yelp. This must be the place.  So brings me here, to eat and more importantly, to find out how the rest of the couple's day went. I was STARVING 2.0, it opens at 4 so at 5, I brought a friend who is as anti-hipster as you can get. I am ever so slightly hipster, or hipster friendly, just so you know.  Well, what a delightful place. A sweet little area with groovy wallpaper and an adjacent bar area with taps, tv screens and bar stools. Air conditioned. We ordered craft brews on tap, me an IPA that was not too hoppy, but hoppy enough, if you are Goldilocks of IPA. I am not, I will drink anything but wheat beer, which I will use as hair conditioner. For all my hairs.  I ordered fried chicken and potato waffles and my friend ordered a charcuterie type platter. I realized now that was the thing the couple was fighting over, blahblahblah sounds like \"tiddly bits\" and maybe he prolly liked to order it as an appetizer and she was like no carbs or pork products or something. Huh. He should just order what he wants. Sharing food sucks. Why would you ever?  So my fried chicken was pure succulence. Crispy as a bitch on the outside, tender as balls on the inside. I was so happy, I take my fried chicken very seriously. There were two intricate pieces of parts my discerning eye could not distinguish and no bones? Or was I so hungry I ate the bones? It's hard to say, but yes, this was fingerfuckn great fried chicken. Not too salty, salty enough! On 3 potato waffles. Yes. Dipped in some kind of berry preserve. Sweet, but not too sweet, I prefer savoury side of any given menu, which is why I don't like carbs drowned in syrup, like other chicken and waffle places that will remain nameless.  The pool couple never showed but I got this:  From the inside, through the window, on the patio I watched a beautiful elderly lady grand dame matriarch-type with a couple of pre-school ginger grandchildren and their JCrew-type parental units. The lot all ordered sliders and burgers and she had the Fried Green Tomato Sandwich. She took the top off  and methodically pulled it apart bite by bite with her elegant fingers. She ate the whole thing like a trooper, all the while engaging lovingly with her family. I thought maybe she was a widow? Maybe her husband, the father and grandpa of this brood, and her argued over proscuitto and if he banged some skinny bitch named Anna with long red hair. And he died never saying anything, always keeping his secret, and in the end she wins because guess what? SHE gets to eat the last sandwich.  Next time, wings."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for more at the little bar on the corner. Comfort food (love the fries, home made ketchup, burgers, and daily roasts), good beer selection, generous $5 glasses of wine, and a friendly casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I braved heading east on a rainy night recently to bid farewell to two of my favourites as they embark on their journey even further east... to The Maritimes.   I had a couple of glasses of wine here, and the cocktails looked good. Interior is cute, wall-papered, and though I didnt' have snacks, I was jealous of the ones I saw. Get those nachos, girl."}
