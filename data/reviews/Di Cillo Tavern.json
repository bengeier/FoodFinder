{"text":"-small restaurant attached to bar-bright lights, vinyl table tops, TV on wall
but the food is great and cheap
the pasta dish with clams or mussels is outstanding-as good as Giovanni's at a fraction of the cost
the French fries are the best I have tasted outside of France-I believe that he first soaks them in ice water-that way the outsides are crisp and the inside cooked but still moist 
the fried fish and ground round are top notch
 the chef Mr Tomorrow is outstanding"}
{"text":"Do not let the exterior fool you, Ci Cillo's Tavern is solid dive bar in Mayfield with cheap drinks, affordable food with large portions and a cozy environment.

Located right next to Ganley Nissan and a Marco's pizza, Di Cillo's has a simple 1 page menu that offers traditional apps, burgers, salads, seafood and some classic Italian dishes.  My co-workers and I came for lunch on a Friday during lent because we heard the 'whaler' fish fry was highly recommended.  I split the whaler and a bun-less hamburger with a co-worker, while the last person in our party tried the Deluxe burger. 

The whaler was a huge piece of cod, flattened, breaded and fried.  It could have been thicker or maybe crisper, but overall it was fine.  The fries were good, and they are worth the $1 add-on compared to the chips.  The burgers were okay, but nothing special.  The deluxe had some red and green peppers that made it better than I expected.  

The final bill made the meal a value, but the whaler and burgers were average."}
{"text":"The meat here is very good. The bar is amazing. This is the best bar in Mayfield, not saying much,but you know!.  The food is pretty good. This is  one of the few places you can find real smoked meat on the east side.  I had the smoked brisket sandwich. The meat was really good.  Smoked percefectly, flavor, not bitter and not salty.  The size of the sandwich had more to be desired.  For 9$ it was pretty small maybe 5oz max.  For 9$ it should be ginormous it was not!.  That is the only thing I orded, but it tired to get more but was denied.  I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch.   I was there before 2:30pm.  Asked for another, it 2was slightly after 2:30pm. The kind server advised the chefs were at a  catering event and did not  know how to heat up the rest of the meat.  So we were deinied.  I really have to say this place has extreme potential. I just felt that the size  of a 9 dollar samich should be larger than a big roast beef at Arbys. Qualtiy put this at 4 stars, value = 2 stars. Hence 3 stars.  Next time I will get the rib and or the combo platter."}
{"text":"I had the Breakfast Burger and I loved it. You get so much food and a really small bill. The fish fry during lent is phenomenal and will explode off your plate it's so big. New kitchen staff is much more friendly and consistent that past regimes. Hope they stay for a long time!! Great local hangout."}
{"text":"fair warning .. this place is a dive bar so do not go inside expecting 5 star accomodations .. we went for the fish fry .. seated quickly since we had a small party .. the lighting in the dining area is less than helpful so thankfully my flashlight on my smart phone was handy so I could read the menu .. clam chowder excellent .. the Whaler fish fry came w/a piece of cod a foot long (no kidding .. had to take 1/2 home) .. pierogies + cold slaw both tasty .. we are not drinkers so we were a bit disappointed that they did not offer iced tea other than what was on the soda fountain so we ordered a Coke that came out as all syrup & a 7Up that came out as all soda water .. they could not fix the problem so we settled for water .."}
{"text":"Di Cellos isn't much to look at from the outside, you have to walk through the bar to get to the dining room but trust me it's worth it.

I had a bowl of the house clam chowder, it was creamy and savory and a good value.

I had the whaler fish fry which was perfectly fried and hung off both ends of my plate. It tasted great and the house made tartar sauce was delicious (but we had to ask for fresh). 

I ordered the perogies and caramelized onions with my fish and they were fantastic, the onions were surprisingly sweet and everything mixed together well.

We'll definitely be back soon!"}
