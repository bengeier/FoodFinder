{"text":"Worst customer service I ever experienced food is cold and taste old if your not korean forghet it the waitresses barely speed English"}
{"text":"3.5/5  I have been coming to Sariwon for many years now and it's a decent spot to go to if you're tired of the low quality all you can eat Korean BBQ joints around town.   The quality of meat is quite nice, but be mindful of what type of meat you're ordering and whether it is marinated or not. Ask the servers to let you know how best to eat the meat, or else you may run the risk of eating unseasoned meat and have a miserable time. Service is alright and I found most of the staff don't speak English so if you don't speak Korean, you may be doing a lot of finger pointing while ordering.   Some issues that I have though...  - It is pricey! Be prepared to pay quite a bit if you want the nicer cuts of meat.  - The seafood pancake is quite disappointing. It has an incredibly weird texture and not a lot of seafood in it as well.  - The burners that they have are quite weak. It takes quite a while for it to cook or char the meat."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Sariwon for a while and finally went last night. While some of the constructive reviews are correct re: slow service, we still liked it a lot and had a great dinner. We ordered the BBQ. We had the beef and pork ribs. It comes with a ton of sides and the most amazing sesame oil / salt / pepper dipping sauce. You do need to flip the meat and serve it yourself, but it's fun!"}
{"text":"Was expecting much more since it was top rated on blogto. We ordered pork belly and beef rib and it was mediocre. Service was poor and food was overpriced. I will never come back here. Oh geul boh geul is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Just arrived home after a visit to Sariwon Korean BBQ Restaurant.   Experience: Awesome  Food Quality: Great  Service: Could be better, not horrible though  Flavour: Great mix of flavours, lots of very different blends that i wouldn't have thought of prior to coming to this restaurant  Atmosphere: Somewhat modern, very nice to sit in. Korean themed (obviously). Not as modern as competitor Choko BBQ  We ordered both the plain rib and the marinated rib. I personally preferred the marinated rib however my father preferred the plain rib with the salt and pepper sauce. Really enjoyed sealing off wraps of lettuce with everything on the table. AWESOME!  Visit this restaurant if u get the chance."}
{"text":"I think the piggy restaurant across the street is better.  food wise, raw meat is raw meat but the service is so much better on the other side.  price wise, pretty much the same.  my cooking abilities, unfortunately is the same no matter where I go.  food tends to either be under cook or burnt.    when it came to side dishes, there were a few different ones here.  some were good and some were, let's say different from what you normally get (in a good way).    I think I should accept the fact that I'm the type that is, quantity over quality.  no matter how good the quality of the meats are, I don't really get a chance to appreciate it.  it goes from the grill, to my mouth and down to my stomach within seconds.  I think ayce formats are more my type of places.  they are lighter on the pockets ($70 for 2 very small portions of uncooked meat here today) and heavier in my stomach.   I come out wobbling but more importantly, happy.    will I come back... I guess.  not necessarily to this restaurant but, can't always eat ayce all the time."}
{"text":"Sariwon never fail us when we want some decent Korean food.    I agree with fellow Yelpers the service was not great.  But I still love their Cold Noodle dish!!!!  Excellent for hot summer days.    Beef Ribs are must order every time."}
{"text":"On a recent and rare journey to North York, I stumbled upon this gem of a place. At the suggestion of a friend of a friend who lives in the area, I was told there is no better Korean BBQ in the city...  READ MORE AT  http://to-belly.blogspot.ca/2013/01/sariwon-korean-bbq.html"}
{"text":"When it comes to the food, I'd have to say it was pretty good. The beef ribs, bulgogi, grilled mackerel, and the free side dishes are all great. The chilled cinnamon tea at the end is absolutely fantastic. The service, however, is atrocious. We were completely ignored, and when a waiter is finally found it's very hard to communicate as they barely speak the language Also they are quite rude and seem like they just don't care. Not to mention it takes forever to get what you asked for...if you get it at all. I refuse to go back because of this- there are plenty of places with food just as good and your experience isn't ruined by the terrible service."}
{"text":"Coming from a Korean, this is the best Korean BBQ restaurant in T.O. This is where all the Koreans go. It is managed by a Korean man with a long history of running the best Korean restaurant wherever he went (previously at Seoul House at Orfus Road). It targets the Korean community and not \"foreigners\" so you know the food will be authentic. A word of caution to non-Koreans though: their service is also Korean - don't expect a four star restaurant service. That's just how it is in Korea when the restaurant is busy. But think of all the free side dishes you're getting!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo yummy and authentic! The meats were very good quality (we got the spare ribs and pork belly) and they provide you with so many things to put into your little lettuce wrap.  There were so many dishes that we couldn't even see the table. There's the lettuce wrap, all the side dishes, some sort of lettuce salad slaw thing, garlic, hot peppers, and more I can't remember. Another plus about this place is that the ventilation is very good and the place doesn't feel stuffy.  Service-wise we were able to communicate with the servers but having my Korean friend there helped a lot. Also, they were more than willing to give us refills of the sides and we were never rushed to finish up and leave even though they were close to closing for the night.  The meal ended with a sweet cinnamon tasting tea that was pretty amazing. Overall, I cannot wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Service was not great....food was ok... The side dishes were not as plentiful as other restaurants."}
{"text":"Been to this Korean bbq place couple times(avg out about once a year).  Their beef and food are good in general.  Last night we had sirloin and kalbi and I must say they won't disappoint you... if they are cooked to your standard.  One thing about korean bbq is you don't know if they want to cook for you or they want you to cook yourself!  And it is always this miscommunication that leaves the beef usually not cooked the way you want it.  Another thing worth to mention is their service.  It seems to be the case that there is always one or two servers there that are more busy than the others... leading to again... miscommunications or missing something.  For example, last night we weren't given anything to drink and when we asked, they gave us tea.  We finished the tea very quickly and when we asked for water, they didn't give us the usual Korean small jar of water..."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are saying it is an expensive restaurant. This is a place where you can have appetizer, main course, and dessert drink for $17-$28 for Korean BBQ. Where else can you get \"fine dining\" for a 3 course meal for this price ??  This is an authentic Korean restaurant which is great value and has a great menu!! Don't go to this restaurant if you're cheap."}
{"text":"Um...who died and made Karl \"When I was teaching English in Korea\" R. the expert on Korean cuisine? While I am still Yelping, Imma gonna be The Definitive Last Word on Korean Restaurants and Culture, thank you very much and gamsahamnida. So I brought out my special fact-checking pen for this review and sorry, Karl, it's filled with bitch ink ;)  Karl R., Bijan V., and Neil T. and I gathered in Thornhill for our UYE Korean BBQ with a Translator and Driver http://www.yelp.ca/events/thornhill-uye-korean-bbq-with-a-translator-and-driver  VIBE Sariwon is not your average Korean grill house nor is it one of those godawful AYCE joints run by Chinese people. It's the \"luxury\" kind of establishment that Korean families might flock to for special occasions and have weddings at. See that lace on the curtains and floral upholstery? That says \"high class\" all the way.   FOOD The BBQ was outstanding. The marinade for the galbi (short ribs, $24) was well-balanced with just enough sugar in it to leave a good char on the edges from the caramelization. I also enjoyed the \"ZuMuLuk\"[1] (strips of sirloin in sesame oil, $26). Karl found it \"a tad chewy\" but many Koreans (myself included) will abide the slightly resilient texture inherent in the more flavorful sirloin, much the way some might prefer a Porterhouse or ribeye over the tenderest filet mignon. The accompanying condiments and garnishes[2] were all super fresh and appetizing.  Karl questions why the ban chan (side dishes) were brought out in waves. That's because there are certain sides that accompany the meat and others that go with rice. Don't be a rookie and have rice with your BBQ; it's just going to bloat up your stomach and crowd out the meat. The rice arrives at the end of the BBQ, and at Sariwon, it was flecked with yellow dots of millet. This is when the server swarms every square inch of the table top with a dozen little plates of ban chan. You don't get these delicious freebies at those cheapo 'cue joints.  The quality of ingredients is way better than what I've found in Bloor Street's Korea Town and it's got slightly higher prices to match. That said, the damage for our meal was just $24 a head including tax and tip--but no alcohol because as Karl mentioned, they were out of Korean beer so we just drank barley tea. But when Karl complains in his review that we got no water, he doesn't realize that the word for barley tea (bori cha) that the staff kept refilling for us and the word for water (mool) are interchangeable in Korean.[3]  SERVICE Each table is equipped with an electronic doorbell that you ring to summon the help. This may seem odd to some but it's more gentile than the usual method; yelling out \"Hey, over here!\" to get someone's attention. When we first arrived and the place was empty, one of the servers would come right away. As the place filled up, it sometimes took a couple of rings to get someone running up to our table, often with a stank-face look that said, \"Now, what?\" Still, the service here is much better than what you find at 95% percent of the Korean restaurants in town. Hostile service is such a fixture of Korean dining that I would be suspicious of any place where the staff were too effusive and cheerful.  I was very impressed with Sariwon. It was worth the 40-minute subway ride in a germ can from downtown. Thanks to Karl for the ride to the restaurant, and Neil T. for the drive back to civilization; and to Bijan V. for just showing up and being an all-around good guy.  Is Sariwon the best Korean BBQ in the GTA? I'll tell you when I've tried every last one of them but for now it's 5 stars.[4]  ***ETA: Don't listen to Neil.*** =================================== [1] WTF is this spelling? It's usually spelled \"jumuleok\" or \"jumuluk\" or \"jumuluck\" [2] lettuce for wraps, samjang (soybean-based sauce for the wrap), scallion salad, sliced garlic and chile peppers, tangy dipping sauce with chives [3] See, Karl? The Korean language is not only scientific, it is very complex. :) [4] Dang. I really meant to bring on the bitch but I held back because Karl R. is my friend. What's wrong with me??"}
{"text":"Restaurant looks good, and food is better than in many korean bbq  places around.. BUT... Nothing served on time. I takes forever to get your soup. Looks like waiters just don't want to serve it  and hoping we will never ask for it. ONE STAR, thats all what its worth for such a crapy service!  Oh yah!  after the soup is served there is no ladle or bowls... Was it done intentionally? And at the end,  instead of simply asking \"You don't tip?\" you should ask WHY?"}
{"text":"Food not bad, but if you want to do BBQ, better go in group. All dishes have to order a minimum of 2. So if you want a romantic dinner, you DO NOT have variety. The menu is so confusing, so is the washroom"}
{"text":"Sariwon, located on Yonge St. just approximately 150 metres North of Clark Ave., is one of the best Korean BBQ restaurants in the area!  The restaurant is located right at the entrance of the plaza and next to the indoor parking entrances. Inside the restaurant, the air is clean and cool (which is rare for a Korean BBQ restaurant), and the table and seats are nice and clean, with no sign of oil stains or food residue anywhere.  We ordered a Jijimi (Korean pancake) as appetizer as well as two orders of meat, one pork and one beef, for the BBQ.  The waiter came very soon with our pancake and removed the metal lid that covers the BBQ grill and lit it up. Six Korean side dishes were also served at the same time.  Our orders of Saeng Deung Sim (beef) and Sam Kyub Sal (pork) came and the waiter placed the beef strips on the grill for us and left. It also came with one pot of spicy tofu soup. Both kinds of meat were delicious although I personally preferred the beef better.  The bill comes with a glass of cold Korean Cinnamon tea, which I personally don't like so I can't comment on that.  The restaurant is equipped with on-demand table service bells, so trying to get the attention of the waiters in the busy restaurant wouldn't be an issue.  Overall I think this is a great restaurant for authentic Korean BBQ in a clean and cool environment!  Washroom rating: 7.5/10"}
{"text":"The Korean BBQ meat had no taste at all but was very expensive. The experience was okay at first but the waitress was rude towards me and my family, giving us an attitude- almost as if we owed her money. Would not come again."}
{"text":"There are so many Korean BBQ joints out there so it's hard to differentiate what is good sometimes.  But after trying this place, one can really begin to appreciate that quality meats come at a price.  Just like how All you can eat sushi places will always have sub-par quality when comparing to a la carte sushi restaurants, the same can be said in the Korean bbq scene.  The meats:  So like I said, you get what you pay for.  To give you a baseline, one order of beef ribs is 24.95 or something.  To feel contently full, my friend and I ordered that and Pork belly which was also in the 20$ price range.  I'm sure I could have ordered one more dish but that might have been overboard for me.  The meats they provide are thick and juicy (not the thin crap you get at all you can eat bbqs). They come pre-marinated or just fresh.  Beef ribs come with a bone and a  long slab of meat attached to it.  You can either cut it into pieces before grilling or grill, then cut.  After you grill your meats, you're provided with lettuce to wrap the meat up in accompanied with a great sauce.  Magic!  Of course, all the usual fixings accompany the meal like kimchi and the other small dishes I will not name simply because I dont know the names. (better to admit you're clueless then try and just look plain dumb)  Also, not that it matters to me much but they could perhaps expand their bbq selection to include more fish and chicken but I wouldn't be ordering it there anyways.    Your CLOTHES........... ...do not smell afterwards!! yay! hahah that's a big vice for me.  Each table is ventilated well.   Service: very friendly.  I love traditional Korean mannerisms.  The host came to each table to check on people to see if they were having a good time and enjoying the food too!   Overall: Awesome quality Korean BBQ place!  Always better in a bigger group so you can get more of a variety of meats to try but still good regardless. Forget all you can eats....put some grade A meats in your belly!"}
{"text":"Myselft and my Tough Mudder team-mates decided to go for Korean BBQ after doing the race.  We were tired, muddy, and didn't have a reservation, but were promptly seated. The food was fantastic: each one of us got a BBQ meat dish, which came with sides, soup and rice.  The waitress cooked the meat for us and was attentive and helpful.  While it's true that she wasn't the most talkative person, we were there for the food, and the food was great.  We practically waddled out of the restaurtant, and with tax and tip it worked out to $35/person."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean BBQ!! Best beef ribs and nice service. It could get busy at dinner time. Better make reservations!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place but as soon as we were seated, a cockroach was crawling by my husbands head as we were seated against the wall.  We left and went a different kbbq restaurant close by."}
{"text":"Upscale Korean BBQ joint, I love it!    Love everything from the greeting at the entrance, the cleanliness of the built-in grille, the superb friendly service, and most of all ... the awesomeness of the ventilation that prevented me from smelling like a piece of meat.  Love, love the teriyaki-like marinated short ribs.  It was so flavorful.  The sweetness from the marinade and smokiness from the grille, oh so divine!  Flipping meat over the grille and sharing them with good friends, now ... this is my kind of joint!"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean BBQ in Toronto! The meat quality was excellent! I love their beef. The staffs were friendly. Defiantly come back again!"}
{"text":"Was seated in the back of the bus because my son was with us. -1 Side dishe(s) -1 too few, soul house gives about twice as much Price /value -1 i remember it being more for less...( i'm on diet and i wasn't filled like the past time, something is a foot) Quality -1 first 4 servings were good second 2 were fat, i should have inspected it maybe tried to swap it for new meat. Maybe others like $33 slabs of fatty fat.. Service -1 being moved to rear as mentioned above.. Which could have been salvaged, but because we were in back those extra 10 feet proved to be too far for server to come and look after us(yes i know how to buzz) but past experiences they'd put meat down for us at start, and subsequent portions to the end(small \"service\" extra) plus they'd come and ask if we need more sides(which there were few this time) and even ask in past if we needed more water tea if not just fill it. This time we beeped a minimum of 10 times  Not busy lunch visit Weekend Ymmv for dinner during week??  Before this visit i'd recommend, this time i'd have to steer people clear an go to soul house on steeles west."}
{"text":"Since we have a baby we definitely have to x-out all of the smoky BBQ joints, although we do love good food anywhere we can get it. Sariwon was large and clean, which is definitely a plus. The Pahn Chan (side dishes) were OK. For some reason they didn't give us kimchi, which is always the best measurement of a good Korean restaurant. My wife and I ate the Nengmyun and the Seafood Pancake. The Nengmyun was not bad and the Seafood Pancake was so huge that we took it home and ate it for three days afterwards. The service was just OK but then when you have a baby you are always in a rush so maybe it was us.   I would go back to try the BBQ and other meat options.  -- I went back to Sariwon and ordered the bulgogi dolsut (marinated beef hot pot) and I was disappointed. Also my wife ordered the pressure cooked beef hot pot and was disappointed as well.  The final straw was the fact the restaurant manager couldn't find a baby seat in a reasonable amount of time and the owner was hacking next to the cash register behind our table. I will not go to Sariwon again :(."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ is minimum 2 orders, u can mix and match off the page. It comes with all the sides orders u see in the pics, incl rice, romain lettuce leaves and soup (with veggie and small bits of tofu and beef). Additional bowls of rice are $1.50.   Note, place has ventilation. The fan was loud enough to have to speak louder. You still do come out smelling like BBQ.   Ordered the beef ribs and sirloin under their Korean BBQ section. One was marinaded and the other not, not even salt or pepper. Though the meat tasted fresh, some salt and pepper would have made it taste awesome. If I'd known, I would just gone to a Korean grocery store and picked up premium meat to cook at home. This was disappointing.   The sirloin came with 3 thinner sliced pieces for $25, the beef ribs were two pieces of rolled bones $30. The over all bill came to $64 with one extra bowl of rice before taxes.   Service is slow, looks understaffed. They seem to understand English but then not understand you. This place lost a star b/c of the dead salad they served (the ones with noticeable browning on the edge), I let the owner know. He started at it and said oh no, but then came back with it again with sauces now poured on it. Guess it was more shocking for him that someone forgot the sauce than it being stale.   Wanted to really like this place. Overall nice to try, but left feeling that it wasn't really worth it. In the end prefer AYCE Korean BBQ or maybe raiding a Korean grocery store and cooking it at home."}
{"text":"Sariwon is where you get high quality Korean BBQ meat, definitely not the type served at all you can eat places.  We made a reservation for five at 8pm and the place was packed! I highly suggest making reservations, especially for the BBQ tables.   There didn't seem to be a hostess so groups of people stood around the front entrance for some time. I walked towards this older gentleman in a suit and told him I had a reservation and he pointed me to my friends who were already here. Although all the staff members were busy, one improvement they can make is the seating system..  We ordered pork belly, marinated sirloin and marinated beef ribs - which didn't seem like a lot for $25 per serving but when devoured with rice and the side dishes wrapped in lettuce, we were actually so full! The meat came with tofu soup, we didn't even have room to finish that. The seafood pancake here is also delicious - not as large as other restaurants but we were so full anyways.   Service was surprisingly quickly, our server actually chastised us for over cooking the pork belly. She came back and cooked the beef for us in case we ruined that as well.   I will definitely be back - Sariwon is one of the best Korean BBQ establishments I've been to by far!"}
{"text":"Service Service Service (did not exist unless you worked for it)... No restaurant can exist profitably if they don't provide at minimum 'average' service. I don't enjoy searching for a waiter/waitress through my entire meal for basic needs, like a drink. Seems like I was always waiting for someone to take my order or to come around to see if we needed anything, terrible!! And no Korean beer??? I wasn't pleased."}
{"text":"This place has the best traditional korean bbq in Toronto!!!!!!! Nice restaurant, nice service, reasonable price!!!!"}
{"text":"My group ate bibim naengmyun (Korean spicy cold noodles) and yukgaejang (spicy beef soup) for lunch. I believe my last visit to the restaurant was not great - expensive and nothing noteworthy. However, this time I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the main dish as well as the side dishes. I felt that the food was great and priced appropriately. I would love to come back again and try other food."}
{"text":"This was my first foray into Korean fine dining as we entered this place in error not realizing how expensive it was. Just looking for a Korean cuisine fix I really wasn't prepared to pay 17$ for bulgogi which I can get for less than half the price at some food court somewhere.  After the transition from denial to acceptance I was finally able to focus on the food as it arrived. It was outstanding! The side dishes they give you are enough for a whole meal and the quality of the food was way better than what I was used to. It was quite a memorable experience. This place is now my benchmark for Korean food.  I'd give a 5 but i'm factoring inthe fact  that the price is 3-4 times what I normally spend while the food is probably twice better. Not really sure if I can quantify my rating like that but what the hell."}
{"text":"The first authentic Korean bbq place I've been to and it was a pretty good experience.   Side dishes were plentiful and delicious. Similar to other Korean restaurants, there is a button you can ring for service, which was very prompt.   We ordered a plate of samgyupsal (pork belly) and kalbi (beef ribs). We were kind of expecting more from the pork belly, but it was pretty good nonetheless. The kalbi was the star, however. It was succulent, flavorful and went perfectly with the lettuce wrap.   Along with the meats, we also got a bowl of jajangmyun (tasty!) and kimchi soup (so full after). Had I known they provided a bowl of soup with our dinner, I wouldn't have ordered the kimchi soup..   Anyways, the kalbi is enough of a reason to come back, but I do want to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. It's a pity because the food here is very good. The reviews about the food are true.  We had a table of four and ordered two orders of the kalbi beef, it came and it was delicious. The restaurant gives you lettuce (romaine) for you to wrap and eat with the meat. We finished our lettuce but still had plenty of meat left. Asked the waitress for more lettuce and she essentially said to us:  we can't give you more lettuce because your table only ordered two orders of meat. The additional lettuce will be extra cost.  I should mention that each order of meat is 30 dollars, and meant to be shared. It is totally not reasonable to expect a table of four to order four orders of the meat. We ordered additional dishes as well. We did not cheap out by any mean, our final bill was $108 (4 people).  There were other unpleasant exchanges tonight, language barrier (don't go to this restaurant if you are not korean and don't have any korean friends coming with you), rushed service and while she didn't say it, but you could sense a general frustration from the waitress all night long on each exchange with her.  We will definitely not be going back here again. Again, it's a pity because the food is quite decent."}
{"text":"When the restaurant first opened it was great. Now it's terrible. The food is okay. The quality and quantity has gone down. The big problem is customer service. The service is awful. The manager is rude. I wanted to order a glass of wine and no one came to the table after the food was served. Everything is rushed. They want you in and out. I will never go back. There are better choices and more options now."}
{"text":"Reported by several customers one including March 30, 2018 that they re-serve left over side dishes!"}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner for my Mother's birthday last night with the family after realizing that Piggy's Restaurant is closed.  I used to go to Sariwon when it was the only Korean BBQ place in the area but now with other options, I will never go back.    The customer service is terrible, they are rude and as we waited with our family of 7 to be seated, several servers ignored us until we asked if we could be seated.    The BBQ meat is incredibly expensive.  $35 for 2 pieces of marinated Kabli beef... I was shocked. $27 for 12 shrimps and 1 piece of cuttlefish and  $24 for 4 pieces of Pork belly.... WHAT???  The food is mediocre but terribly expensive and the waitresses are really rude, they role the eyes when you ask for more bowls or water.  Will never go back there."}
{"text":"Went here a couple days ago since Cho Sun Ok was closed (on Tuesdays!) and my friends and I really wanted some korean food. I believe it was the second time I was at this location and the food was pretty decent. The waitresses were all pretty nice and welcomed us warmly.  I ordered the YukGaeJang while my friends ordered Ddukbaegi Bulgogi and the spicy cold chewy noodles (which I forgot the name). Food came out in a timely manner and the waitresses kindly refilled our side dishes at our request. Everything tasted pretty good overall so no complaints on my end. The soup menu did have less choices in compared to other korean restaurants but definitely has more choices than Cho Sun Ok (to compare).   Not sure if we came during a quiet time but they didn't have too many customers (it was around 3pm) at the time. The place itself is quite spacious and the decor is nice and comfy. It has a hint of simplicity and elegance too.  All in all, not a bad place to get some korean food if your original location is not open/too busy (i.e. my situation)."}
{"text":"I would argue because their BBQ is on the built in grills, that it is far healthier to bbq here - with that being said, it is also potentially (and in my opinion) far less delicious. With these BBQs, the meat is not sizzling and cooked in its natural fat, it's being cooked but the fat is dripping away and doesn't get that beautiful burn on it.   We ordered an order of samgyupsal (pork belly). I don't remember how much it was - but I think it was $19.95 for one order. Which came with four strips. The strips aren't too thick and after they're cooked, they seemed quit thin. The pork belly itself, after being cooked wasn't all that delicious, it wasn't bad. But it wasn't quit satisfying and usually pork belly is like \"hit you in the gut satisfying.\" So it was disappointing.  Overall their food was okay, their side dishes were good and they had good service but I probably won't come back for their pork belly - maybe to try something else next time."}
{"text":"[Service] - / - nice waiters and waitresses - electronic buttons for faster service than waving or calling - tables could be a tad bit cleaner (missed spots) - comfortable seating - comfortable temperature within the restaurant - appetizers delivered within 5 minutes - main course delivered within the next 5 minutes  [Food] - / - delicious, very hot or cold depending on the dish - plenty of side dishes - side dishes tastes good - rice is steamy and well made - quality of ingredients is high  [Cleanliness] - / - tables neatly set - utensils and dishes properly washed and dried - bathrooms regularly clean sometimes can be dirty)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, as always. The cuts of beef are so tender that they just melt in your mouth. I can't speak to the pork as I don't eat it, but I have been told that they are just as delicious. All the side dishes are great too, the kimchi cabbage has a nice kick to it, the egg and white fish have a delicate balance that doesn't leave any aftertaste, but the peanuts are the show stopper for me. Warm and slightly smokey.  Mmmmmmmmm The only drawback here is the staff. The waitresses are quite cold and have a bit of attitude. It's as though they are doing you the favour by serving you when it's their job to do so. This is why I only go 1-2 times a year. While the price is higher than every other bbq place in the GTA, the food is worth it, so that isn't a roadblock. The service always has been and continues to be."}
{"text":"OK. So I may be a little spoiled being Korean and from NYC. But this place was AWFUL!   Friends said it was very high-end and great korean bbq, so we went one night, thought we would give it a try. We had a pretty large table + the night started out ok. The side dishes were not bad but nothing special. The meats were decent but the portions seemed smaller than I'm used to. We ordered marinated beef + pork belly for bbq, some stews + soju.   I thought it was a little odd that the server put on the marinated beef on the grill first but hey, we were hungry so I went with it. After that was done, she started to put the pork on the same grill - HOLD UP. That's a no no. So I asked her in Korean if she could change the grill - I didn't want the flavors from the beef to be on the pork. She said, not a problem + walked away. Then the \"manager\" came over with a new grill and asked if we wanted it changed. Yes, that's kind of what we asked for. She said, we don't normally do this unless the customer asks for it. Well, we = the customers were asking for it. I didn't understand why the conversation was still going on. She was extremely rude + had so much attitude that it ruined the mood at the table. Then she proceeded to stand at the table + ask if there was a problem - still coping the attitude... ??  Needless to say, I will never be eating here again + can't say I would recommend this restaurant to anyone else...   Oh and the man who seemed to be the owner of the place, sat at the front of the restaurant with his shoes off. That should have been the first clue that this wasn't a high-end place.   Another thing that I found odd - the server started cooking the meat for us + then walked off, not tending to the grill. And the place wasn't that busy at all. Is this normal in Toronto?"}
{"text":"Good a la carte KBBQ restaurant although it could get busy especially on the weekend.  We ordered pork belly and sirloin. Quality of the meat was good. Also came with a stone bowl stew and rice.  The seafood pancake was huge, thick and fluffy, but lacked seafood. Sweet and sour pork came on a huge plate - flavourful but a tad dry and got soggy if not eaten quickly.   The amount of food we ordered stuffed 4 people. We could have ordered less but we wanted a variety. Decent price for the portion sizes you receive and fast service despite it being busy. Large menu so there's plenty of dishes to try."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for Korean bbq! I like their grill and the fact that we don't have to ask the servers to change the grill every time. It's a clean restaurant, comfortable and have enough space.   We ordered the pork belly and Kalbi from their bbq menu. At first, we thought the portions were really small when they came out, but they were so filling. Plus, the order came with salad, soy bean stew, lettuce, Korean house salad mix (green onions), Ssamjang, garlic, hot peppers and the side dishes at no extra cost. The servers were very generous with the side dishes. When we requested for more, they attended to our request and service was very quick.   The pork belly was succulent, filled with flavour. The beef was tender, well marinated and prepared. The meat were grilled to perfection :)  I really like this place. The servers are very professional and came around often. Their equipment are up to date and well kept. The restaurant itself was relaxing and very roomy. The barbeque is amazingly delicious. I will definitely come back to this place to try out other food in their menu!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant as I had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite a while.  Convinced my husband and brought him here and we were ecstatic to try something new than our usual AYCE korean bbq.  We ordered two orders of tenderloin and kalbi.  While the meats were definitely of high quality but disappointingly lacking flavour, there was almost no flavour.  I recall husband and I had to mix the garlic and some sort of soy sauce and personally I never dip condiments due to lack of flavours because I find it insulting to the food.  It's definitely pricey but we wouldn't have mind it if it tasted good.  I may revisit in the future to give it another shot but not with my husband as he was very disappointed."}
{"text":"To be honest, if there was a way to give 2.5 stars, I'd give it, but I think others' reviews praise this restaurant a little too much.  To sum it up, if the dishes were half price, I wouldn't consider going back from a value standpoint.  That's not to say the food was bad, it was.......acceptable. It wasn't anything spectacular, what you would expect a 4 or 5-star restaurant to offer.  The portions of meat per order of BBQ are small when you consider how much you're paying for it, and even though they do give you a lot of side dishes, they're not of top quality.  I don't think I'd be able to honestly recommend this place to others, there are far better in the Christie & Bloor intersection in Koreatown."}
{"text":"Not your typical Korean BBQ restaurant aka not AYCE, and apparently this is the authentic KBBQ experience. They have a regular menu as well.   Ordered off the BBQ menu: the first Kalbi option ($33) and sliced pork ($28). The kalbi isn't like the regular short ribs you get at Korean restaurant. You get about 2 1/2 slices and it was tasty though! The slice pork was slightly grilled beforehand so it doesn't take as long for you to cook it. You get about 4 large slices. They marinate it in something with lemongrass; my boyfriend and I didn't enjoy it as much.   The service here was very slow, I think there were only 3 workers waiting. At one point we rang the service bell at least 4 times and still waited 10 minutes to get help.   The meal came with 2 bowls of rice, 1 tofu soup, 1 large side dish of japchae (which I really liked) and a lot of smaller side dishes (zucchini, fish cakes (loved), kimchi, cucumbers, and a few others I've never had before).  Overall, I don't think I'd come back due to lack of service and how pricey it was."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and tasty. We had the bbq and two additional items from their menu. Staff is attentive, service is quick and restaurant is clean. Bbq is not all you can eat. The only downside was the bbq menu is not clear so our bbq order was incorrect. We had ordered the sirloin beef option but got pork instead. We ended up paying extra for the beef even the error was on their end (they changed their pricing but did not update their menu nor were we warned ahead of time). This may be due to language barriers. Anyhow, we will be back because the dipping sauce alone is to die for!"}
{"text":"Love the BBQ here. One of the best Korean BBQs around! The meats are really fresh, wrap it with the fresh lettuce and you get instant yum! They finish your meal off with a cold ginger tea, absolutely refreshing! Great dinning experience."}
{"text":"No pork bone soup???? The spicy chicken is soggy and not spicy enough. The kimchi soup was too spicey with hot pepper in it. The side dish was not impressive at all. It's pricey compare to other Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"The ambience is ok. Food ok, but not as \"special\" as expected. I didnt like the service though. Its bad!!! From the Korean restaurants i've tried, this is the only highend place that would limit you to order the side dishes. It's just terrible. :("}
{"text":"I am giving it 2 stars not because the food isn't great. In fact, it's delicious! But I have to say we leave here feeling a little upset everytime we come because the customer service really sucks.   The owner/older gentleman that's sometimes the host, is terrible. He really doesn't care about your needs and he isn't afraid to show it. If you come in with no reservations, he'll give you a big SIGH and then look stressed to the max and start giving you attitude. I've also noticed that he is so much nicer to Koreans -- we've been here a few times with our Korean speaking friends and he was SUPER nice to us. But when we came here with no Korean friends they were like MEH.   The price at this place is also a lot more than the other similar Korean BBQ places and when it's a full house the staff give you little to no customer service because they are so busy. It would be good if they hired one or two more waitresses so we can actually get the right food or not have to press the button 3 times in the span of 5 minutes to get someone's attention.   But we keep coming back. The food is good. Customer service sucks."}
{"text":"By now you've probably read Susan's review of this place and decided that it's so fantastic.  Not so fast!  Let's hear from one of us meat-loving non-Korean, never been to Korea types -- that's me.  +++PROS+++ 1. Ingredients are definitely better than the AYCE joints, food is fresher 2. Nice decor.  When I start to put decor as a 'pro' for a review, you know I am trying to be nice. 3. Don't listen to Susan, eat it with rice.  Way better that way (screw tradition, it tastes good). 4. Lots of trimmin's  ---CONS--- 1. I could have eaten double what I ate.  Though I didn't leave hungry, I didn't exactly leave satisfied.  That's what I get for going with a bunch of pansy eaters. 2. If you're going to be a 'classy' Korean restaurant, you might want to fill up my tea within 40 minutes of me requesting it (did you not hear me the first two times?).   3. They have service bells there too that you just ring for service.  It doesn't work, they won't come.  They were nice, there just wasn't enough workers or they weren't very good at their job.  I've had much better service at Xe Lua on Spadina.  Not kidding. 4. Anything north of Eglinton (let alone Steeles!) really involves a fucking monumental trek.  Is it worth the trip to Thornhill from downtown?  No. 5. Parking lot is too small for the plaza, and it wasn't even busy.  I imagine it being a disaster on weekends (think Pac Mall)."}
{"text":"So let me preface this by saying I have been here more than a dozen times and it's pretty much a hit a miss depending on the service and quality of food that you get.  The prices are a bit steeper in relation to other Korean restaurants so it's definitely a downer when you get bad service and bad food.  On my most recent trip there in Saturday, we had unfortunately bad service and mediocre food.  We were seated away in a room even though the entire dining area was pretty much empty and pretty much forgotten about.  We were given an egg baked in a dish as a service, but were not given our banchan until after we were served our first dish.    The first dish to arrive was the kampoonggi and normally this dish is pretty good or at least I deemed as one of the best, but this day they set it down and it looked like it had been slopped together and no effort was put into presentation as most of the dish had shifted to one side of the plate.  The dish was very disappointing and did not taste as good as I remembered it to be.  It didn't taste like it had just been made and lacked the kick that it had.  We also ordered the bulgogi which was probably the only decent dish that we had that evening.  It was tender and not too fatty.  The last dish we had was the dolsotbibimbap.  You can't really go wrong with that and so I would say it was good, but the portion in relation to other restaurants was quite small.    The service was terrible in general as they failed to come back to ask if we needed anything and we were all dying of thirst with our tiny cup of water.  They seated the table next to us and told them they had to eat within 50 minutes as they only had time for that.  Overall, the food was just so so and not worth the extra $$$ that we paid to eat at what I would deem a premium restaurant.  Their customer service definitely needs to improve dramatically.  Save your money unless you really want bbq meat."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Had Galbijim, Kalbi, Tangsoonyuk, Korean Pancake, and pork belly w/ cabbage. Galbijim and Pancake were my favorites, but overall, nothing spectacular.   We were a party of 10 and was placed in the BBQ room. Service was weak and for long periods of time, they didn't refill our tea and water.  They also weren't good at splitting up the bills for the 3 families that were amongst the party. At the end, our friend paid for it all and we paid him back.  Overall, food was okay, but not as good as Makkol Chon in scarborough. Won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I choose this korean bbq restaurant based on Toronto Blogs review saying it's the #1 korean bbq in Toronto. I find this review/article totally wrong and was extremely disappointed. I was with a party of 8 and they gave us a table where we were split into 2 tables, this was already weird. However, the korean ladies serving us were really nice and sweet.   We ordered sirloin, kalbee, marinated kalbee and pork belly. Only the marinated kalbee was good but it's not the best i've had. The rest of the meat I wouldnt even bother ordering. The sirloin and kalbee are so thin and tasteless. The pork belly looked like bacon and again tasteless. Such a waste of money. You also think you will be ordering a lot but the portions are EXTREMELY SMALL. I usually always look forward to korean side dishes but this place didn't have not much variety; they had kim chi, cucumbers (soggy), egg plant and bean sprouts.   I'm not sure if it was because we were seated in the room in the back but the restaurant is extremely HOT.. seems like the air con wasnt even on. I understand you smell like bbq when you leave k bbq but this felt like a sauna.   After eating here, this place def did not satisfy any of our k bbq cravings."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, now. This is far and away the best Korean BBQ I've had in the Toronto area.  Everything that I've tried on the menu so far has been excellent. The price is perfectly reasonable given the quality of the food and the quantities served. Furthermore, the restaurant is spacious, clean, and the wait staff are super-helpful if you're unfamiliar with Korean BBQ.  This restaurant comes highly recommended to all my friends."}
{"text":"wow fail. i thought 3 and half stars on yelp with thirty some reviews is decent... and nope.   had a very hard time understanding what the waitress is saying. the menu is very confusing, somethings you need to order two sets the same thing, somethings must be combined with other items, weird restrictions.   we had bacon and steak, they actually bring you the whole steak and cut it up in little pieces... why cut my steak??? bacon was good, except when the waitress dropped ours in the grill.  i think the set-up is confusing: the waiting staff puts the meat on the grill and leaves, leaving all the grilling utinsils on the far end of the table.. soooo i thought they will come back and grill my stuff ( i tried to ask the waitress.. she shrugged and left)... and i waited and waited, nope nobody came, so i got fed up started grilling my own stuff, and THEN the waiting staff shows up re-flips everything i just flipped, and cuts(or scissors) my steak. WTF? okay so that's fine, then another guy came started shaking his head at us cuz \"we weren't watching our food it's all burnt\" and then he gave me a piece of steak that's too raw t to eat... wat?   Overall, very complicated and confusing experience. Still don't know what happened. wont' come again. expensive and weird experience for me. i've gone to few other korean bbq restaurants, this one is just.. odd.  i'm giving it 1.5 star. steak looked fresh, bacon was good... when i decided not to listen to the waiters and do my own thing.  oh! another thing, towards the end of our meal, a few people from a neighboring table stood up and they stood right at the a/c unit that cools the room (they have a standup unit in the restaurant) flipping their hair and arm flapping and everything... wow that's sanitary."}
{"text":"We came in super hungry and left really full. Food tasted authentic. The kalbi was superb! Bibimbap was also really good. For an appetizer, the chapchae was huge in portion! It was pretty much an extra dish. As for service, the staff were really friendly and accommodating. If you're in the Thornhill area and you're craving some Korean, definitely come to Sariwon!"}
{"text":"Not your usual cramped, smoky Korean BBQ joint, this place is open, airy with large banquet seating. It is slightly more pricey but allows one to eat in comfort especially when you've got so many small plates your lap starts to become part of the table.  Here are a few pointers because unless you speak Korean, it may be hard to get a good handle on the menu from the waiters.  BBQ - order the short ribs and boneless beef (both are awesome) and if you're thinking about ordering something else, consider getting a second order of the same (they are that good). Avoid the pork.  Bibimap - great dish, goes well with the soup  Seafood pancake - like a giant scallion pancake, this comes HUGE, like a whole other entree, but very solid.  That was more than enough for four people. I'll come back and try the bulgoki. Overall, a great setting to enjoy the meat fest of Korean BBQ and about as authentic as you can get in Toronto. You smell like BBQ when you leave but who wouldn't want to smell delicious."}
{"text":"3.7/5.0  So I been to Sariwon twice so far. So far, food wise Sariwon is the BEST Korean restaurant I ever been in Toronto. This place recently changed to new management. So I think they are still trying to figure things out, BUT still be aware of quality of service. They are not that attentive as other restaurants. They definitely need better system for serving. If you can sacrifice service for food, you should definitely make a trip to this restaurant. You can get a nice Korean BBQ in other Korean restaurants so try other Korean dishes like Ssambap or kkanpunggi (my fav. dish from here so far). They have a private reception space for big group party as well.  I will love to give them 4 stars(which is very rare to me) but due to the quality of service, I can only give them 3.7. I will definitely go back when I need good Korean food."}
{"text":"This place is more of an open concept when compared to Kobi, and a bit nicer decor. Their food is excellent, and their cuts of meat were premium. Service was just OK - Not particularly friendly. My only gripe was that one of the wait staff gave us the biggest frown when we asked for more kimchi. I suppose she was annoyed because we asked for more kimchi a few times, but we're a table of 6 and spent over $700 and gave way more in tips to cover the kimchi.   I'd probably come again for the food, but won't be helping them promote their restaurant."}
{"text":"This is not an all you can eat place... the meats and seafood they serve are good quality.  We decided to go here for a family dinner and it was a pleasant experience.  It's a fairly big restaurant and because of that   you are not cramped in small tables.  I suggest this place for big groups because thier portions are pretty big and compared to other korean bbq place you pay a little bit more.  Thier kimchi is awesome i am not sure if it's house - made or not but it's good.  The only negative thing I would say is that you need a car if you are from mississauga or even dt area.  It's accessible via public transit but I don't know if it's worth the travel time."}
{"text":"Walking in I quickly by noticed a number of Asian families enjoying the culinary experience provided by the establishment. I knew coming in I was at the right place.  My brother and I went with a selection of meats (marinated beef, pork belly, beef rib) and it came with a wide assortment of side dishes to compliment the meal. Our hostess was very kind and took her time to explain everything if though we didn't ask. Perhaps us taking our time to discuss family stuff gave her the impression we were novices but nonetheless she was very kind and helpful so brownie points for that.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty and I enjoyed my meal. Nothing is more enjoyable than cooking one's own food while chatting about with friends and family. I truly enjoy the Korean BBQ experience in all its splendor.  The pork belly fell short compared to the other two and I enjoyed the beef rib the most.  Price-tag is decent."}
{"text":"Sariwon is actually my favourite Korean BBQ restaurant in the GTA, so I was pretty surprised to see that it doesn't have very good reviews. After reading about people's complaints, I think I get why.  The first time I was here, a few Korean friends took me here and showed me the ropes of how to eat proper Korean BBQ. Don't come here if you want to gorge yourself in meat - that would probably wreck your wallet. You have to eat piece with care - wrap it in lettuce, add some of the soybean paste, and then add a little bit of rice. If you'd like, add a bit of garlic and/or jalapeños for extra spice. You have to eat the meats that way if you want to fill your stomach, just eating the meats alone will not fill you up.  The quality of their dishes are generally quite good. Their meat in particular is some of the best I've ever had. The only one that is marinated is the one that explicitly says \"marinated\" kalbi (probably my favourite), the rest of the meats aren't and it's not supposed to be. That's how you eat Korean BBQ. Korean Grill House is not proper Korean BBQ, so don't expect your meat to be drenched in sauce.  It is quite pricy, I spent about $35 per person for their marinated kalbi, and you must order a minimum of two. Why? Because they give you quite a bit of stuff along with the meats - lettuce, salad, 6 side dishes, soy bean soup, and a small cinnamon drink at the end as a dessert. If you're not full but don't want to spend more money, just ask for more side dishes and keep eating that along with your meat - you should be ingesting your daily intake of vegetables anyway.  Now I do see that service is a problem. Had I not come initially with friends, I would've been confused as to how I'm supposed to eat everything, and the servers are not all that patient in explaining what to do (partly because of their English proficiency). The service seems to be less attentive when the manager/owner is not there - usually they cook everything for you if they're on top of the service, but if they're busy or lazy, they just put the meat on the grill for you and expect you to do the rest, so you might be sitting there wondering when the meat is done. If they leave you alone, just cook the meat on each side until you don't see any more pink, then cut it into bite sized pieces with the scissors they give you.   I came here yesterday on a Sunday night and I was a bit annoyed that instead of serving one of just two tables in the restaurant, they were busy feeding themselves and making their own kbbq - at least it's nice to know that they're willing to eat their own food too. There is a button by each table that you can press to get their attention - but don't expect them to come smiling and willing to help, they're just not that friendly (minus the manager who's always greeting customers with a smile and asking how the food was).  I would've given them 5 stars if the service yesterday was a bit more attentive, oh and they started charging for extra lettuce - which makes no sense with the premium price you're already paying. Nevertheless, if you are here on the right day with proper staffing, it will feel more like a 5-star experience, and the food is always consistently good - that's what's brought me back here many times over the past 7 years. Just don't be so nit picky about the service, and eat the food the way they're meant to be eaten and you should have a great meal."}
{"text":"-1 star because my spicy beef soup had pretty much no beef at all, and prices are not cheap. The soup base itself is good, and the purple rice is very tasty. I also liked the side dishes. The fish to me was just normal.   Good: the place smells amazing when you walk in. Very spacious interior. There are many dishes here that I have not seen in Korean restaurants before.   We came here upon Korean salon's suggestions (we went to hair salon before dinner) hence I am anchored to think highly of this place.   Will definitely try their BBQ next time to see whether they live up to my anticipation."}
{"text":"A nicely appointed Korean BBQ that's actually Korean owned/operated. Everyone -- Korean and those not so blessed -- is greeted effusively at the front door by the owner/manager. Tables are comfy, each featuring a gas powered cooker built into the table. When I say tables are comfy, that's code to old hands as \"no oddly arranged natural gas pipe that actually makes sitting at the table nearly impossible for all guests\".   Decor is modern, clean and reminiscent of Swiss Chalet.   In Korean tradition, each table has a little door bell that summons the wait staff and one should feel free to press it. It's not like that stewardess call button that you're strongly encouraged NEVER to press in coach as it will summon the most pissed off flight attendant who will sternly explain to you union rules require her to only respond to the call button in the event  you're experiencing anaphylactic shock . And you won't get your tomato juice.  Service is still of that \"guilty but with an explanation\" level you have to typical grin and bear at K-joints. We tried to order the Korean beers on the menu (OB and Hite-uh) but they were apparently sold out.  Soju seemed to be plentiful. The waitress said she'd check their mekjoo supply. We left instructions \"if not Korean beer then water\". We got neither.  The place can be a bit hard to spot as its sign is written purely in the Korean hangul script. Do you know hangul? It is very scientific. If you don't know hangul or that Korea has four distinct seasons, just look for the restaurant with the big red ^ (caret) character on its sign. The ^ is actually the letter S in hangul. So you can see it is a very scientific alphabet. Despite the perfusion of Korean in use (at a Korean restaurant no less.... what gives?) the staff seems to work well in both white dork and English.  Parking is pretty atrocious. Despite a nearly empty restaurant (as well as the empty Akki restaurant next door), we had to drive up and down the narrow lot to find an empty space. Maybe there are a number of small businesses in the strip that use the parking for employees. We got there about 6 pm on a Wednesday. I suppose that it's undeniably winter and a few spots are now taken up with plowed snow might contribute to tighter parking conditions.   The food. Well the food is pretty good and well worth the uncertainty you're going to be beered or you have to take a running start at a snowbank with your little Pontiac Firefly to wedge it in to a spot.  We ordered kalbi and strips of sirloin. The kalbi was spot on although the sirloin was a tad chewy.   The banchan (the side dishes) are plentiful but don't seem to come out all at once. They mostly arrived mid-meal. Given this appears to be an all you can eat BBQ house, it would be to their advantage to first bring out the veggies and kimchi so you can fill up on that first.  The meal ends with a kind of sweet iced cinnamon tea with some pine nuts.  That might be a seasonal thing. Koreans have an almost homeopathic approach to food/season pairings (ie like cures like). Cold foods are served in winter. Hot foods are served in summer. The belief is that errr. Well, it's a belief."}
{"text":"Sariwon is the place to go if you're looking for a more authentic KBBQ experience. I'd highly recommend the MARINATED KALBI (only the marinated one!). I want to know how they marinate their kalbi because they make it sooo yummy..  We also ordered the SAMGYEOPSAL (Pork). It's full of fatty good-ness. The dinner set comes with a tofu soup too - definitely enough for a dinner for two :)"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and a few co-workers based in Toronto suggested this place for dinner.  I made my way to this establishment, right on Yonge Street, in a very dominate Korean part of town.  Parking was easy, since it's located in a large strip mall.  Right when you walk in, you're hit with a bright setting, the hustle and bussle of the staff and full tables.  We were greeted in Korean, of which I don't speak, but my co-worker does; and were seated immediately.  We landed a table by the window, to which we could see the snow fall and proceeded to order drinks and review the menu.  Since this was my first time having Korean BBQ, I told my co-worker that I was at the mercy of what he thought would be a fantastic meal.  He quickly selected two key items and ordered in Korean; how much more real/authentic can you get?!?!    He ordered the classic spare ribs and a fried dish of sliced beef in a sweet and sour sauce.  On top of what he ordered, you're given a wide assortment of side dishes to go along with your meal, rice and hot soup.  Our food arrived shortly after the side dishes and the waitress proceed to place the seasoned cut meat right on the grill, which was built right into our table.  Once it was placed on to the grill, we were left to finish the cooking process (FUN!).    Once the meat was cooked, you take a leaf of lettuce, apply a little sauce, some pickled vegetables and a pile of BBQ beef; then go to town!!!  The flavors were amazing and the meat was cooked to perfection.  On top of our BBQ, the fried beef in sweet and sour sauce was fantastic.  I've had sweet and sour before, but the seasoned beef, fried in a tasty batter was a great refresher on great food.    This serving style was very unique, fun and a great way to make food fun!!!  I would highly recommend this place.  Don't think twice, punch the address into your GPS and go!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and overpriced!! Food is decent but much better choice across the street such as Piggy."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just writing this review. I was introduced to Korean BBQ a few years ago by a colleague of mine and since then OMG gotta come in Toronto more often. I tried several places around Canada and the US and Sariwon ranks in the top tier."}
{"text":"I went to Sariwon for a birthday party and was served an array of dishes. The Korean food is a mixbag. You never know what you are going to get. On one hand, the sweet and sour and the gyozas were very good and flavourful. But on the other hand, the kimchi felt extremely salty. The food is decent, but the quality seems to be lackluster in comparison to the pricing."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening with family for a BBQ dinner but we were disappointed with how changed it was. The meat was just not fresh and service was just meh, don't think it was worth the price we paid for. Maybe other dishes are not as bad but it's time they step up with their BBQ quality."}
{"text":"Truly disappointed at how this restaurant have gone from a 4 star to 2 star from my own experience.  I did a food show here years ago and enjoyed their food.  The last couple times I have been here service was below average. Food presentation was still nice and clean but did not necessarily taste better.  Overall, for the price and value, I did not think it's worth for me to go back."}
{"text":"This has been my go to Korean BBQ restaurant for years but recently heard they changed owners and definitely can tell the food quality is not the same. It was good but not great and same with the service"}
{"text":"Oh Sariwon, how you continue to disappoint.  For some inexplicable reason, this restaurant always comes up when we discuss where to go for Korean BBQ and I always cave and decide to give them another chance to redeem themselves.  At some point, I think I will put my foot down and say no to Sariwon forever and this experience may be my last.  We went in for dinner BBQ (2 adults, 2 kids ages 4 & 8), ordered 1 order of samgyup sal, 2 orders of beef galbi and 1 order of pork galbi.  What can I say?  Samgyupsal came still frozen and took forever to grill to the crispiness we like.  The pork \"galbi\" was some other cut of pork, (I'm guessing pork shoulder) and was nowhere near as tender as pork \"rib\" meat should have been.  The beef galbi was cut so thin that made me think 'I should have just ordered the bulgogi.'  The quality of their food is getting worse by the visit and it really bothers me that they sell cheaper cuts of meat disguised as more expensive cut and defraud their patrons.  I hope they realize that by cheating their customers this way will be the end of them one day.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"probably the best lettuce wrap Korean BBQ I've had to date. It not all you can eat but instead you have to have minimum 2 orders of meat. With all the side dishes it was pretty much all I could eat. Service was great as there wasn't much people during lunch hours on a week day. Food was fresh and flavor of the meat was just right...not too sweet like other places do it. The only thing I don't like is the grill they use. The gaps in the grill are too big and one piece of meat fell through. When it happened it was like slow motion and you could hear me scream out loud NOOOOOOOO....MY MEAT. If it was all you could eat I wouldn't care but in this case every piece of meat must be savored. What I like most was the sweet drink they served at the end for dessert. I didn't know what it was but after some research I found out that it was a type of Korean rice wine served sweet and extra cold. Loved it. The only reason I give it a 4 star is because of the grill incident and the prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean restaurant. Service is good and food is high quality. Will try the BBQ next time"}
{"text":"The place is nice. The food is decent. Service is below average. If you don't know about Korean food you might find difficulties at this place."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious! The best Korean bbq in Toronto in my opinion. Pork belly $18 and Sirloin $25 - both portions were plentiful and the meat was so tender and tasty. The bbq comes with salad (yummy. It has papaya in it), side dishes, tofu soup sizzling in a stone pot, lettuce and garlic to wrap your meat with, a delicious dipping sauce....     The only downside and it was a major breaking factor is the service. The service was soooo sloooowwww. It took them 5 mins to give me a menu, over 10 to take my order, did not check up on me the entire time I was there, waited 10 mins but no one ever came over so I can get the check so I had to walk over to the cashier instead. I went in the afternoon (around 2 pm) so it wasn't very busy and there were plenty of staff working. I really don't know why they didn't want to help me. Maybe because I'm not Korean? Anyways very disappointed with the service but the food was great."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a high quality Korean bbq place, this is the place to go to.  Their meat, especially their kalbi, is nice and marinated and really quite fresh.  What's also fun in this place is that they give you quite a bit of high quality side dishes.    The cost is about $35-40 per person, so it's definitely pricey.  I would definitely go again but probably for special occasions :)."}
{"text":"Well, seeing as how I have 99 reviews now, I must write one more to get to 100!  I went to this place for my birthday with a few friends after a Korean co-worker of mine had told me this is the best Korean place in the GTA.   This place is a cut above any of the other Korean places I've tried. They do Korean BBQ and other a la carte Korean dishes. We did the BBQ. We did a mixed plate for 3 (they charge 25 per person with a minimum of 2 orders I think). It included a few kinds of pork, and prawns. Meat was high quality and all the sides were very good. I especially liked the little appetizer with the salted smelts and crunchy peanuts. They give you lettuce cups for the meat and you're supposed to make little cups with meat, sauce and salads. We struggled a bit, and it was pretty comical watching the server trying to instruct us.  One confusing thing was that we couldn't figure out whether we were supposed to do the grilling or the server. When she first brought the meats to the table she put them on. Then every now and then she would come back and flip things. But it became clear she wasn't coming often enough so we had to take over. I think she was just doing us a favour because she thought we didn't know what we were doing, which we didn't. My only other complaint was that she took away the rib bones before I had the chance to grill them and suck the last meat off! that was a bit annoying. next time i would be more on top of that.  I'de go back but it's a trek. It's in Thornhill."}
{"text":"the food were ok, the service were a bit slow. but over all, they are OK. IMHO, the portion is very stingy for the price you pay. I guess I have to find another good korean restaurant around. (must be somewhere, I saw a lot of korean restaurant here) I ordered the regular food. Kalbi, Bulgogi, the spicy pork and noodle."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and ambience is great - considered upscale for korean restaurants. However, the value for your money is quite bad compared to other korean BBQ restaurants, of which there are literally dozens in the area.   I've been here several times, usually when presentation for people is more important than the food. Usually its with a bunch of guys, and we like to eat meat. NEVER is there enough meat. I think the BBQ meat sets are about 1/2 to 3/4 the regular portions of all other korean BBQ joints i've been to in the same general area (i.e. yonge-steeles and yonge-finch areas)   Food is fine, and the clean presentation makes up for something, but not enough.  Also, as someone else mentioned, the service is quite slow.  They do seem to get quite busy so the waitresses have a lot to deal with and often forget about you."}
{"text":"Had a cousins night out so decided to go full blown Korean where we can have authentic Korean BBQ and down it with Soju!  There's a big difference with AYCE Korean BBQ versus non AYCE Korean BBQ as the quality of meat given is so much better at non AYCE.  Sure you won't be insanely stuffed but hopefully the quality will makeup for it.  The infrared grills and the ventilation of the restaurant were excellent so the meat cooked evenly, plus you don't get the smoke all over the place.  We enjoyed out our dinner here as we ordered a variety of meat and seafood but the stand out was by far the marinated kalbi ribs.  Sure the non marinated was good but the marinated one was soooooo much better!    The variety of banchan was also very good but do yourself a favour and ask for \"muk\" or \"mook\" which is not served in many Korean BBQ places.  Great tip from my cousin!  Though a bit pricy it was definitely enjoyable and would definitely come back again.  4 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Korean BBQ!!  I feel most places that serve Korean BBQ are all the same, except this one.  What makes this place special is the meats they serve are really a cut above.  So when coming I always like to order non-marinated meats, so you can really taste the flavour of the meat and not the quality of the marinade.  Place is also more pricy then others, would recommend this for occasions and dinner dates :)"}
{"text":"One word to describe my experience DISAPPOINTING, Chako's would have been better.   I dined with a friend, at Saiwon, when I looked at the menu I noticed most meat items were between $25-35 with pork belly costing $20. For the Sirloin steak which were two pieces cut into 4 a total of 3-4 ounces of meat, which was nothing costs $25. Its way overpriced, whats more the quality of the meat which I was hoping would be excellent was less than appetizing since it was the same quality as Chako's. After dining with my friend, the bill came to $49, at this price I could have eaten a 7 ounce steak at Octagon steakhouse for $25 and trust me, Octagon steak house has a much more superior service and quality for the food. Lastly, one of my biggest issues was cleanliness, Sariwon is clean to the exception of the washroom which had no soap, and used towels on the floor. I think a restaurant's bathroom cleanliness tells you everything you need to know about a restaurant's quality.   In any case I give Sariwon a 2/5, the food was at the very least edible. taste and quality of the meat was the same as Chako's but at least Chako gives you more for your money. This restaurant has put me off Korean food for awhile.    To those seeking to find a social gathering with Friends go to Chako's. For those who are a couple and seeking a restaurant for dinner go to Octagon. I hope this review saves you a trip."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday so we were able to order one of the larger combos (costing around $200). It consisted of 2 large platters of high quality meat, 4 kimchi seafood tofu soups, 6 salads, and a variety of side dishes.    Overall, it was not bad. Quality of the meats was quite good but nothing really stood out to me though except the samgyupsal and the fact that you would not come out of the restaurant smelling like bbq."}
{"text":"Our go to Korean bbq in York Region.  The meats are always really fresh and authentic.  They have a great selection of complimentary Korean small dishes.    My only complain is their grill.  The heat is not like your usual grill that fires up vertically.  Their heat sources fires up at 45 degrees, two of them. So you will feel the heat directly in your face while you are cooking the bbq meats."}
{"text":"Sariwon is a decent Korean BBQ place, but it is important to know what you are aiming to eat there.  Are you a pork-belly kind of person? If so, Sariwon would provide an \"ok\" experience, but you'd be best to visit Piggy's Restaurant instead, where thick cut premium pork belly is offered instead of the thinly sliced ones here.  Are you a beef rib (kalbi) kind of person? If so, Sariwon is perfect. Their beef rib is tender, good quality and the marinate is delectable.  When I came here with 3 other friends, we ordered an order of pork belly and an order of marinated beef. A delicious seafood soup and an order of glass noodles were given to us as part of the meal, along with an array of standard Korean side dishes. That was more than enough food for us.  If you are not familiar with Korean-run BBQ places, you have to press the service button on the side to get service. We dined on a Friday and they were somewhat busy, so our alarm were ignored/forgotten several times. It was not a deal-breaker for us.  Overall, I would definitely come here again (for the kalbi!)."}
{"text":"Rude pushy people food was sample sizes and way over priced for what you get I don't think my dog would have eaten what was thrown at our table"}
{"text":"Dishes I have enjoyed: -Kalbi: marinated beef -Beef shabu-shabu (hot pot dish) -Bibimbop (rice, veggies and ground beef in a black stone bowl) -Side dishes in general. They change each time I visit this restaurant. I like the variety. -Japchae (Korean glass noodles) as a side dish  Dishes that were so-so: -Japchae (Korean glass noodles) as an appetizer: too much pepper -Jampong (spicy seafood noodle soup): didn't like the broth  Drop in one star, because service can be inconsistent and mostly tailored to Korean customers. Atmosphere is warm. Their booths are nice and comfortable. There's a party room upstairs."}
{"text":"worst place for korean bbq. meat quality was very low..it was the most disgusting bbq ive ever had. had to pay around 30 per order..so disgusted"}
{"text":"Great place for Korean BBQ with all the side dishes that are included. Love the spicey tofu soup that comes with the cool yourself kalbi. You must order at least two orders of cook yourself kalbi. The atmosphere is nice, always busy. A little on the pricier side as far as Korean BBQ goes but this is one of our usual spots to eat.  Pork belly a little too bland for the sangyepsal."}
{"text":"Oh, Sariwon... its food is as flavourful as its service is bland. Very tasty menu. Quality meat for the bbq, very good banchan, tasty dishes. Their beef is well marinated in general. The place can get pricey if you order exclusively bbq though. Service is reliably brusque. The servers who work here tend to sorta toss the plates on the table and look generally over it. It irked me at first, but now I'm wondering if it's kinda their shtick. Great food served with (for better or worse) a touch of attitude. Would I come back? ...yes..."}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in Toronto hands down! The most authentically tasting compared to BBQ that I have in Korea every time that I go visit. The quality of meat is always fresh and our family always enjoy it with spicy noodles on the side."}
{"text":"Sariwon is famous for its table BBQ which I've enjoyed in the past when entertaining visiting guests. On this visit I only had Bibim Naeng Myun for lunch. The kochujang (fermented hot sauce) was very good. The selection of banchan (side dishes) was disappointingly limited compared with what I remembered getting in the past. The noodles were very good but not ecstacy-inducing as they can sometimes be."}
{"text":"MEAT! MEAT! Tons of MEAT! Great Tasting Meat!  If you have picky friends that have a certain of standard of where and what they are dining.. Sariwon certainly is the place to go.  If you have friends that want to smell like a piece of meat after having Korean BBQ, don't take them here! Since Sariwon has such awesome ventilation system.. they will be disappointed!  If you have friends who enjoys good services, book a table at Sariwon.. they would think you are awesome and you know where to go!  Back Ribs! I would have just ordered the back ribs ($24.95)... and I would be happy eating the whole thing by myself and more!! Sirloin in Sesame sauce ($25.95) was not bad either!  Pork Belly($18.95) was such a disappointment... avoid since it was just sliced pork with no marinate..  I have to confess that I would not be a vegetarian in the near future... Where is my MEAT??"}
{"text":"Sariwon is a fine Korean BBQ Restaurant. The meats are generally of excellent quality, the side dishes are plentiful, and the complementary japchae (only downside is that refills are unavailable for the japchae) is among the best in the city. The service is friendly and helpful and the actual restaurant is spacious and comfortable, which is somewhat of a rare find for Asian dining.   However, for the most part the meats are completely flavorless (unseasoned, unmarinated) except for a few select options, and there isn't much in the way of available sauces. The grills themselves are a weird form factor, which results in an extremely uncomfortable (HOT) cooking environment if you happen to be the one manning the grill. Unlike typical Korean grill houses, there is not a circular, removable, recessed grill which prevents splatter and shields diners from the heat. The grill is table-surface depth, and the result is that holding your hand near the grill (necessary to cook or grab cooked foods) results in a serious amount of heat exposure.  The grill size is also somewhat small, and with tables designed for as many as 6 or 8, you'll find the grill will be too small for more than 4 people to eat at a comfortable pace. Also, they only supply you with one set of tongs and one pair of scissors, so each person being in control of what they want to cook at that moment is not really possible.  The price for this place is pretty high (the 6-person meat platter works out to around $55-60 per person after tax/tip, with nothing else ordered, although it could probably serve 7-8 people to reduce the cost).   One other downside is that there are not many tables in close proximity to each other, meaning if you're going with a group larger than 6, you will be separated by several feet (tables aren't really in rows), which is somewhat of a downer. Still, this is a good group dining experience, and a quality Korean BBQ place overall.  Food 7/10 Service 8/10 Decor 7/10 Atmosphere 7/10"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. -1 because it's pretty  expensive for what you get. They do give you a very large amount of banchan.. most of which I've never had before in less authentic korean restaurants.  They also have a pretty fancy looking ventilation system to make sure your clothes don't smell like kbbq at the end  of the night. The service was alright. I don't think they flipped the meat as much as they were supposed though. You also get \"sam\"(?) Which is basically lettuce that you put the delicious meat in."}
{"text":"Service: Your local family run Korean restaurant. Friendly and efficient service. The waiter/waitress might not have the best English, but will get by.  Ambiance: The decor is simple and cozy. Relatively clean.  Food: Traditional marinated Korean BBQ goodness. Its more on the pricey side for the amount of meat you get, but its worth it."}
{"text":"This is authentic Korean food. For BBQ it is excellent! The wait staff is kind and attentive. Prices are fair and quantity of food good. I travel to Korea often, and enjoy the food. Whenever I come to canada I eat here.   Try the pork belly and sirloin on the BBQ you will not regret."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced food with low portions. Only went to try here because Piggys was closed for the day for renovations. Service isnt great. We had the BBQ side of the restaurant, and half out grill wasn't working, servers didnt even try to fix it as our meat was slowly cooking only on one side of the grill. Food was decent, can't say much on the price though. If you like overpriced food this is your place!"}
{"text":"Food was decent; however very small quantity and over priced  Extremely poor customer service!!  server removed our dishes half way with no explanation and purposely told us she cannot refill side dishes and claim that they were sold out.   Definitely would not revisit this restaurant"}
{"text":"Sariwon is the place that Koreans go for their banquets and celebrations.  A lot of people do not know that this place has a second floor banquet hall.  If you are looking for real Korean BBQ and not the AYCE variety that has popped up in various Chinese malls, Sariwon is it.  We rarely leave this place unhappy.  The meats are great quality and you can have them plain or marinated.  They have seafood as well.  If you are new to this type of dining, you should be aware that hands are going to be used.  The meats are cooked at the table and cut into morsels.  You have leafy lettuce, cut garlic, peppers and chilli paste to make a wrap. As the saying goes...\"When in Rome...\" so, look around and watch as seasoned eaters put rice, meats, shredded veggies and spices into the wrap - make a small ball out of it - and down the hatch.  Yum!  A family of four can easily get two servings of meats (same or mix it up).  Don't pay too much attention to the price.  Keep in mind, this is Korean food.  The price includes service items like JapChae, Steamed Eggs, all the BahnChan, wraps, and the best DehnJang Jichae anywhere.  We usually order one more soup or a noodle dish along with the two orders of meat.  All is so good, as I write this review, we will most likely end up there again very soon."}
