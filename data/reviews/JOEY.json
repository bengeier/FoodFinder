{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service and good vibes! 

Have the fish tacos you will not be disappointed 

Thankyou for a lovely evening!"}
{"text":"This is not fancy food.  Do not buy the steak or anything like that.  It's gristley and overdone.  The music is fire though - like junior Vasquez at sound factory circa 1994 house music.  Servers are very nice but who is the DJ!!!???"}
{"text":"This place is great for a sunday afternoon last minute dine in. I was able to get a table for myself and my two family members with no wait time.The service was good.The food took a bit longer but i'm guessing that is because we ordered the paella.Other than that i recommend this spot, you will really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant to eat at in a mall setting in comparison to the variety and options available at Moxies, Pickle Barrel and Jaime Oliver. It has a great options for appetizers, mains and sides. Im a big fan of their fish tacos, steak and sushi, glazed salmon, sweet potato fries and mashed potatoes. The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is fun and inviting where you can have drinks, do little celebrations or just come have dinner. Great vibes, decor, service and concept. Love Joeys !"}
{"text":"Appetizers came cold twice.  Forgot to serve the wine I ordered too.  Half rack of ribs was four ribs.  Not the first poor experience at this location.  I think I will just stay away"}
{"text":"First time here, very accommodating and fancy decor. They also have guest wifi bonus points
The water glasses have a nice blue tint which is eye catching. Started the lunch with a serving of calamari. Calamari is a good portion comes with lemon and a spicy chipotle sauce. They accommodate each other very well. Love that they serve baby squid with there calamari.for lunch we ordered the lobster ravioli, paella, and the prime sirloin. Prime sirloin was on the small side.didn't have that nice cool blue centre. But overall was appetizing . The fried mashed potatoes didn't taste fresh it actually tasted like Idaho mashed potatoes. Wasn't really a fan of it. The baby Tomatoes went well with the steak. On the down side I would expect the steak to be served with a bold sauce to bring out the saltiness of the steak. Overall it was 3.7/5. The lobster ravioli was only served with 4 shrimp couldn't really taste the lobster. Sauce was on the salty side but was pleasing. Rate it 3.6/5. There customer service was really great love there hospitality and staff is great didn't have to wait long to be seated or for service. Very accommodating with babies. Upstairs lounges are well decorated and very clean. 4.6/5 overall I give joeys a 4/5 loved eating here would do it again.

{"text":"Atmosphere. Check - perfect spot for date nights and the staff does a really good job of setting the \"vibe\" (all waiters wear a dark colour, blinds fall down to dim the seating area, tables generally follow a dark theme). 
Service here is also on point. Probably the most impressive part of my experience here. Server took no notes and got everything right. He was always available and very courteous throughout even when my mother requested an order change. Really made the experience more memorable
Areas to improve would be in terms of the food itself. The food display is done well and it looks appetizing, but some of the dishes were slightly overpriced for what they delivered. Taste wise I think some of the food was made to be paired, but by themselves were not seasoned properly."}
{"text":"On my second night in Toronto we walked across the street from our hotel to Joey at Yorkdale mall. There was about a 10 minute wait, but we were treated to a nice sized portion tasting of a Cabernet Sauvignon blend. Points for excellent excellent customer service. 

We were a group of five and were seated after about 10 minutes. I hadn't had much to eat for the day so was really hungry. The rotisserie chicken looked like an excellent paleo-friendly option, so I opted for that. It came with sun-dried tomato gravy and a medley of daily vegetables; instead of the potatoes I ordered a side of sweet potato fries. The waiter had said that there would be a two dollar extra charge, but it never appeared on my bill. Score! The chicken was perfectly cooked as were the vegetables and fries. It was a perfect meal for a chilly night in February and the perfect portion size for a moderately hungry person, while feeling healthy and wholesome. I would definitely recommend the rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"Large dining area upstairs and a cool bar area downstairs.  I like it here.  It's bright, airy, and has a good vibe.

If you need a break from all the shopping \"cray-cray\" or just having a meal, this place works out great.  Meals are decent as many of these places are - lots of booze and somewhat creative dishes.

This is one of the places I call the \"Little Black Dress Mafia\" joints.  The formula works for all of the new places popping up.  Even Shoeless Joe went this way.  Another bar that fell victim to the trend.

They have a simple menu and I like that.  Who wants to read a whole novel just to order a meal.  I like their Chilli Chicken Appy with a brewski.  Surprisingly, their steaks are pretty good as well.  I can almost say that I really haven't had a bad meal or time at Joey's.  I've been going to the one at Don Mills when they first open and I think I've been to everyone in the GTA.

Yeah...I'm a fan.

Cheers!"}
