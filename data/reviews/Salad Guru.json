{"text":"If you like fresh healthy choices, this is the right spot for you. Unlike everything else in that decrepit food court, Salad Guru offers great salads and wraps at an affordable cost. I would greatly recommend to Dawson students and everyone else in the area that wants to enjoy a tasty salad. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Located in Alexis Nihon's top-floor food court, Salad Guru is an inconspicuous salad bar service counter that offers delicious salads with fresh ingredients. I found out about this restaurant through Golo.io, which is a website that allows online ordering for pickup.

Their menu is extensive, with options including ready-made specialty grain bowls, tortilla warps, as well as specialty salads such as the Cobbster (egg, bacon, cheddar, hearts of palms...), the Holy Guacamole (avocado, mixed peppers, tortilla chips, black beans...).

Yesterday, I decided to order for pickup and designed my own salad with the following ingredients: kale, broccoli, water chestnuts, mushrooms, olives, pepper, avocado, chicken breast, goat cheese, red onions, and toasted almonds. 

When I arrived at the counter 5 minutes later, the salad was already prepared. I was greeted warmly; service was efficient and pleasant. The salad exceeded my expectations and was so delicious that I came back again today to order another salad. Service and quality were consistent."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the food court.. So excited to have great salad options and wraps. They have specialty salads or create your own. I had the Bang Bang Asian salad which was amazing!! Will definitely be back to try more of there interesting salad combinations"}
{"text":"What a welcome sight to see. In place of the former Latin/Mexican spot in the Alexis Nihon Plaza's upstairs food court - a specialty slash build-your-own salad place has risen from the vacancy.

The menu is on a double-sided card printed on pink paper. On one side you find the ready to order salad creations, and on the other the design your own details. The menu also has several tortilla wraps and a few specialty grain bowls. 

The many square stainless steel containers of pre-chopped vegetables and other toppings, reminded me of a Chopped or similar \"nouveau\" salad concept.

Good for them for adding a fresh and healthy option to the somewhat basic line up that already exists in the current food court. I do hope they standout taste and even value wise, as at first glance the prices are a little high for a food court (nothing is under $10 before taxes on the specialty salad menu). 

Sadly this often becomes a deterrent, when fast junky food is so easy to grab and often half the price. 

Note: I had already sat down to eat my bowl of ramen from another restaurant across the food court, so I am only writing about what I saw and hope to try."}
