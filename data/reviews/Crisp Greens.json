{"text":"My mind is blown at all of these 4-5 star reviews. I went to this place because I love supporting local businesses and I love healthy food. I should've paid attention when then restaurant was empty at lunch time during the week. Either way, I ordered a panini with Turkey, Brie, and apples and 20 minutes later I got cold toast. Yep. It's was laughable. It looked and tasted like a 6 year old made my lunch. But as the saying goes... fool me once.   The only positive thing about this place is the location.... but it's not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple of fresh juices and was blown away by the price! Over 12$ ($12.44) for about 6 ounces of juice over ice and they poured water through the juicer."}
{"text":"My dreams came true and then some!  I've been wanting a quick salad shop in Chandler so badly for so long I was wishing I could just open one up myself.  Bonus: It's in Downtown Chandler! I've not found a decently priced and great tasting Real Food smoothie anywhere in the Valley--until Crisp Greens. Bonus:  They use frozen fruit instead of ice so it tastes like food instead of flavored water--Best Smoothie in Town by Far!! -I'm a localist and it's a locally owned and operated shop--Yay!  Bonus:  They locally source their ingredients which means it is fresh (definitely tastes fresh instead of papery like most restaurant salads).  Double bonus:  This helps keep our local farmers in business and reduces carbon footprint of bagged lettuce from who knows where. -The salads are huge and tasty!  I almost can't finish them in one sitting...but they are so delicious I always do. Bonus:  If you're in a hurry, on a budget, or it's pizza night, it's big enough to take home to share the goodness of greens with the family as a nutritious and delicious side dish that you otherwise won't take the time to prepare at home! -The staff is friendly and fast.  Bonus:  They are more than willing to accommodate ingredient swaps! -The shop is bright and clean.  Bonus:  It's cool without being pretentious!  Thank you Crisp Greens for making my dreams come true!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place with a lot of promise: Healthy salads that can also be made into a wrap. Love the healthy, fresh ingredients.  A couple areas of improvement include wraps that are a little less dry and sometimes the wait can be long. Also, it is slightly on the expensive side. Other than that, this is one of my go-to spots and a great place to pick up tasty food."}
{"text":"Excellent tasty salad & smoothie today.  Very friendly staff.  Everything is locally sourced.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Bland...  My wife and I tried out this new establishment today.  We agreed to give them a chance in the future to get it all dialed . The reason for 2 stars is because of the friendliness of the staff. Otherwise it would be one star.  We each ordered salads. And we both agreed there was just simply no flavor. The dressings were bland. I ordered chicken..  It may as well been tofu.  No flavor. The bread..  No flavor. We opted to put the lids back on our salads and take them home to add some flavor.  Then we went elsewhere to eat. :).  The store was clean and trendy. Decent atmosphere. The fresh brewed tea was good.  Hopefully they add some flavor to the menu."}
{"text":"Paid $33 for 2 salads that had zero flavor, absolute water flavored dressing...Southwest and Italian...and two, 1/2 cup (at very most) canned soup. That and a small smoothie, which was the most palatable of any of it."}
{"text":"Had for the 1st time today, food was excellent! I think I found new favorite lunch spot! Food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Once again a great experience!  If you find yourself downtown Chandler, AZ and want to grab a quick healthy meal check this place out.   All the ingredients are very fresh... I have never had a wilted leaf in anything I have eaten.   The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere is modern and clean.  I had the Cobb salad with Chicken today and it was perfect. I would have taken a picture but I was really hungry and was halfway through when I decided to post!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place this past week. I NEVER have expectations when I try ANY restaurant for the first time. If it's a great experience it's a bonus, it it had issues I give it a 2nd try before doing a review! Well this place earned 5 stars with neon the first visit. The staff was extremely helpful as I had a kinda confused look on my face. They explained in great detail my options. I went with a salad wrap!it was huge, very fresh, flavorful and more than I could finish at the restaurant. The owner was there and I watched him converse with many guests as he worked the line. The place is uber clean and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. A great choice of unusual drinks and chips. I have read some harsh reviews which were not helpful or constructive but seemed directed at simply hurting a business that is someone's dream. I like this place and would always recommend if you have a problem at ANY business talk to the owners or manager at the time. They can't fix a problem if they aren't aware of it! Sadly little people feel bigger when running down someone's business instead of giving helpful feedback!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there last Saturday with two of my kids.  Wanted something healthy and fun, figured they could eat the bread if they didn't like the salad.  Have to say Wow! My kids shared the Caesar salad and I had the Southwest.  My salad was great, big salad for the price, veggies were fresh and tasty.  Salad dressing was great, was trying to be healthy or would have asked for more and taken it home.  Most amazing thing was I didn't look at the ingredients in the Caesar and when they gave it to my six year old boys there as kale in it.  Can't count the number of times I've tried to get them to eat kale and had to cajole them through 5 bites and then fight another day.  I decided when they rejected it I'd get them something else.  To my shock and amazement, they ate the whole salad, and loved they kale.  They asked what it was and when I told them they said, \"well it doesn't taste like what you try to feed us.\" Talked to the manager, they have some process for washing the kale that makes it unbelievably good.  Many thanks for the help and you can bet I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The food is very fresh and they give you A LOT of it. Our food cost about $10 per person (including a drink) and we have enough for a second meal. My husband even liked his wrap and had left overs- and he is NOT a salad guy lol! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has the best salads in Chandler and the staff is super friendly. I've been here at least a dozen times; it's great for a post-workout meal.  I get a custom version of the Crisp Cobb with the mustard agave dressing, which I highly recommend.  I love that salad so much that I look forward to it as motivation to go to the gym.  Also, Brandon (one of the owners) is personable and very nice to talk to. The whole place has a fresh, fun atmosphere, although I take my order to-go. Every time I've gone the order has been perfectly accurate. The salads can be so filling that I can't finish in one sitting - you get bang for your buck! If you want a unique, delicious salad, try Crisp Greens. It is a perfect addition to DT Chandler."}
{"text":"Finally I found a good place to get a salad! I love Caesar salads but it's very difficult to find a good one for some reason. Theirs comes with romaine AND Kale. Croutons Parmesan and tomatoes. I added chicken for an extra charge and got the dressing on the side. It also came with a small delicious slice of bread. The person working wasvery genuine nice and quick without sacrificing diligent exceptional salad making skills. The salad is delicious the Caesar dressing wasn't grossly fishy and I love places that include tomatoes in their Caesar salads! (it's rare) they have a rewards program and I signed up. They have really delicious looking wraps which I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Walked in just a few minutes ago (about 7:15pm). It was empty, other then a small group eating outside. Sign on door said open and online it states they are open until 7:30 pm. I asked if they were still open because most lights were turned down. The gentleman working hesitantly tells me they are not open, and that they had closed about 10 minutes ago. I told him I swore it said until 7:30. He said \"nope, sorry\". I walk out and look up the hours and sure enough, it says open until 7:30! Not only did he lie right to me, but also lost a potential customer! I have been so excited to try that place being as we live so close! Its a shame someone can lie so easily! Im sure the manager would not be pleased, and if that was the manager, that's am even bigger shame! Never again will I go back to Crisp Greens!"}
{"text":"Great place. Good food, friendly staff. Will definitely come here again.  Great for a fast, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in while in downtown Chandler.  I was in search of a healthy salad and found just what I was looking for!!  My choices were to order theirs, or create my own. I created a nice chopped kale salad with apples, walnuts, strawberry, chicken, and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was very fresh and delicious!!  The only items I would like to see added are mandarin oranges and raisins.  A nice healthy restaurant option for those seeking such in downtown Chandler, Arizona"}
{"text":"I ordered the caesar salad and it was not what I was expecting. There were tomatoes in it and the croutons were extremely salty."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Chandler for business and our associate suggested CrispGreens for lunch.  LOVED it!  We had the CrispZona with the lime-cilantro dressing (that I hope I can duplicate at home) and the CrispSouthwest made into a wrap. Everything about this place just makes you feel it is fresh from the farm. Not expecting such a healthy and fresh option for a business lunch.  We made a return visit a few days later for dinner and tried the turkey/bacon panini, again delicious.  We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Not impressed with my turkey bacon & avocado sandwich, very basic like something I could've made at home. Chicken pot pie soup was definitely made with frozen veggies. $10.50 for soup/sand combo, no drink. Restroom was filthy. We went @ 12:30 p.m on Tuesday & cafe was empty."}
{"text":"Meh. You could do better,  you could do worse. Nothing spectacular about the salads here though that you haven't had before though  they are pretty decently sized. Only one customer came in as we were leaving but apparently \"unkempt dirty table lobby\" was the motif of the day.    Go if the Pirates place next door is really busy, or you have a hankering to look at dirty tables."}
{"text":"my new favorite lunch place. they only have salads- but they are big and you can get it in a wrap for no extra charge. You also choose either chicken or tofu as a protein. The tofu isn't rubbery firm either- it has a nice texture. I like that the salads have a lot of stuff in them- I always get one with berries and nuts. I feel like it's enough food/calories in a wrap where I feel full and satisfied the rest of the afternoon but not in a food coma!  The best part- it tastes delicious!   This is a small place with limited parking just to the north of the building and on the street. But there is more parking a half block away."}
{"text":"Delicioso and healthy food and great service . I like the cob salad  and my husband the grilled turkey panini and the soups .  Brandon is always very kind."}
{"text":"I came here after reading about it on ocotillo friends. It got great reviews.   Store seemed cute enough. Smelled a bit off but I kept an open mind.   Salads were bland. Nickel and dimed for every half full scooper full of bland toppings. Croutons were so salty I had to take off. Bread was actually HARD (read:stale) and the people behind the counter looked pretty much like \"deer in the headlights\" when I asked to sub things out.   By the soda fountain, there was a drainpipe draining water into a dirty floor bucket of some sorts.   Feels like a bad knockoff of Cafe Zupa, they might have tried but this place misses the mark in a big way.   Two thumbs down unless you're looking for a bland half-scooped salad and have no other option. Won't be back. :(   I wanted to like it. I really did. But, yuck."}
{"text":"I've been here once so far. I expect I will go back.  THE SHOP: Not sure why it smelled like a Discount Tire shop? There was a heavy chemical smell. Maybe they just had the floors done, but I had to eat my wrap outside.  THE STAFF/SERVICE: The staff was very friendly, smiled a lot, made my wrap quickly, all was great. Price was normal for a wrap.  THE FOOD: I got the Southwest wrap with chicken. A bit too heavy on the lettuce and lite on the other ingredients. Felt like I paid for mostly a bunch of lettuce. They are a new business and new employees, they will dial it in soon I'm sure.  HEALTHY or NOT? My wrap came with a free chocolate chip cookie and slice of bread. I'm a bit confused by this offering. The place is called Crisp Greens and their pitch is Healthy Food. I'm not on a diet by any means, I tried the cookie and bread (tasted ok) but, the allure of their place is healthy food. No need to tempt the health conscious customer, maybe on a diet, with a cookie and random slice of bread. It's like putting a desert/bakery at the Gym exit! I suggest they find healthier free surprise food toys for their Happy \"Wrap\" Meal.  OVERALL: I'll go back for sure and try it again. I'll update my review as things change. Downtown chandler needs a couple options for healthy lunches. I wish the best of luck to them!!"}
{"text":"Have been dying to check this place out, I love a good salad! I ordered the Crispzona, chopped romaine, avocado, cherry tomatoes, jicama, red onion, tortilla chips, lime-cilantro vinaigrette. Sounded amazing! Unfortunately, there was zero avocado and it was kind of just bland. For a $10 salad I was just expecting a lot more. I wanted to like this place so much. Maybe I will give another salad a try but provab"}
{"text":"Fresh yummy salads wraps and smoothies!  This will be my new go to lunch place.  It's so hard to find something light but delicious and filling for lunch and this place filled that bill.  I had the berry salad - a spinach salad mixed with pecans and cherry tomatoes and goat cheese in a raspberry vinagrette.  I added tofu (they had great tofu that I believe was baked it had great texture and was yummy).  The salad was really plentiful and the ingredients were fresh and crisp and flavorful.  It came with a slice of whole grain bread.  The great thing about this restaurant is that they let you switch out ingredients and add ingredients from a large list to your liking.  I'm not a goat cheese fan so I switched it out for blue cheese. yeah way better. The service was super friendly and fast.  It has ample parking right next to the building - so you can grab a health lunch and be back at work quickly.   You can choose your smoothie combinations and grab a health smoothie for lunch or an afternoon pickmeup.  Now I have no excuses to succumb to the fast but flavorless fried, carb and fat laden fast food lunches.  I have the perfect option. Take out or eat in - the restaurant was very clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I have yet to try something I did not like. Amazing people, everyone is friendly and upbeat. Amazing atmosphere, everyone makes you feel right at home! If you are looking for great tasting healthy food this is the spot to be at. After you have a healthy delicious meal make sure to top it off with one of there homemade chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"This place is not ready for prime time. First of all, they don't have their full menu up on the main wall, they have the sandwich menu on printer paper which I almost missed. I got the SW salad and it was drastically overpriced. It had a few beans, a bit of corn and some tofu (the tofu was the highlight of the salad and there was not nearly enough) and barely any dressing. The quality of the lettuce was inferior. There is no way this should be an $8 salad... I can get a much better one from Paradise. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great little lunch place.. absolutely delicious very clean eating. Salads or you can have your salads made into a wrap. Great for vegans vegetarians and us carnivores .We added a cucumber yogurt dressing to wrap it it was amazing. Also had a smooth Ginger smoothie great flavor. A little on the pricey side but as I said very good it's kinda like the pokie/Subway as you  go down the line and add whatever you want to you're a wrap or salad.nice and clean on the inside."}
{"text":"I returned for a follow up visit because I am a small business owner and know how a bad review can effect a businesses reputation. When I returned I just went for two smoothies. Both were great. I also came back a week after with a friend. She ordered the Arizona Salad, I ordered a cup of the tomato soup and half a panini, everything was good. I have been back since and will continue to support this local business. The food is good, service is a little slow generally speaking, so give yourself a few extra minutes. The people that work there are all kind and usually smiling so that makes up for it :)"}
{"text":"I was out in the area on business and a few clients recommended this place. The food was great it was really fresh and the staff was friendly. I'll definitely eat here when I come back out to the area."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a healthy option in DT Chandler. As a small business owner myself I love to support small local businesses. They have a cute little location with all the right well-designed signage and a simple menu. However, the flavor of their food is well to be nice about it, non-existent. I was so bummed. Not only did I have false hopes about a nice healthy place for lunch around the corner from my office, but I also wasted $10 on a salad that I ended up tossing in the trash. I certainly won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Best salad place around. Great food,  wonderful friendly service. Won't go any where else for my salads now.  Plus they do delivery at lunch during the week and through their website they have grubhub to deliver any time. Plus they do catering. Can't beat getting one of the salads for the office staff, or for a get together at home. Love their smoothie's. The paninis are so good if you aren't in the mood for a salad.  Then gelato for desert. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Worst tasting salad ever, and super SLOW service.  I wanted a healthy salad for lunch, so after reading all the good reviews I decided to give this place a try.  I waited for several minutes before anyone took my order; there were only two people working there.  I got the Arizona salad with chicken.  GROSS!  The chicken tastes like rubber soy product, and the dressing tastes like some sort of household cleaner.  I forced down a couple bites because I was hungry and it was just under $10.  Dressing is nasty and weird tasting - don't they try their products before they sell them?  EWW  If you want a healthy and fresh salad, go to Salad and Go instead.  DON'T COME HERE!"}
{"text":"This was a great place! AWESOME salads and my son enjoyed his wrap and smoothie as well. Its clean, bright and very open. The staff was great ! Very friendly and genuine. I will definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time & definitely not disappointed! Fresh ingredients, friendly service, great location in downtown Chandler...a hidden gem"}
{"text":"We went here after seeing a post on living Chandler.  The food was excellent and the owners themselves we're running the shop on a Friday night.  We shared a Zona salad with chicken which was easily big enough to share, and the turkey panini which was delicious.  We will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love going to Crisp Greens for healthy eating! Everytime I'm there, it's clean, friendly and efficient service. The food is delicious and fresh. I love that it's made to order as well."}
{"text":"Finally I found a good place to get a salad! I love Caesar salads but it's very difficult to find a good one for some reason. Theirs comes with romaine AND Kale.

The salad is delicious the Caesar dressing wasn't grossly fishy and I love places that include tomatoes in their Caesar salad (it's rare) they have a rewards program and I signed up. They have really delicious looking wraps which I can't wait to   *update new fav is the Southwest wrap add tomato and cucumber a little of the chipotle ranch mixed with regular ranch because the chipotle is too spicy for me. It is soooo friggin delicious. Also every time I come here I'm blown away by the staff. Just nice people this place has such an amazing vibe."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I am in LOVE with the Cobb Salad! The dressing that was recommended was SO GOOD!! The lettuce was so crisp and the portion was big! I was very impressed with the customer service and I will definitely come again!  All I can say is AMAZING!! Great place!!"}
{"text":"Painfully Average  The place was meh kinda cute, staff friendly, salads over priced and very bland, I was charged for a sprinkle of crushed tortilla chips???? Chicken is very unseasoned at first I thought they accidental gave me tofu, I would be better if I didn't have to pay $9 for a very veg very average salad, the only good part about this place was the chipotle ranch dressing. Oh and don't get me started on the stake half piece of bread I was given, all in favor for this place being replaced by a Salads To Go say \"I\""}
{"text":"Unacceptable service. I waited for over 20 minutes for a salad wrap. Staff was unorganized and acted like they didn't know how to make a salad. My first clue should've been when I saw them writing orders on a notepad paper. Not only did I receive my order after the two people behind me, but they also received their order before the two people in front of me. Who they also 'cashed out' before me as well. I had to ask about my order. Two ladies they mistakenly made wraps for, they ended up having to re-make them into salads. I'm not sure about you folks but first come first serve usually happens in eating places...unless you order a well done steak. A salad from here apparently equates to that waiting time.    They did give me a free drink but my whole order should have been free. I understand that it's a new place but if you keep running it like this, there will be another one in its place soon enough."}
{"text":"Oh my! This place is delicious! I love how you can get both Kale and Romaine! I'm a stickler for Kale salads, so this place is definitely going to be my new fave! So fresh and so delicious. You basically can make your own salads by adding your own toppings (up to 4, additional is extra), dressing, protein, premiums (e.g. goat cheese, feta, etc). I got the kale and romaine, with olives, tomatoe, onions, and egg. I added the goat cheese and had the lime-cilantro dressing (so very good) on the side. I also got the banana berry smoothie which was like heaven in my mouth! I came around 11am on a weekday and the place was basically empty. Very spacious and clean. I highly recommend! Very affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh taste reasonably priced and entire order was visually appealing. We got delivery off third party site and it came faster than expected and again, not thrown together. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Best salad and wrap around the food and service are both excellent and above expectations. They select high quality ingredients and are fast and efficient but never compromise on quality. My favorite is the chicken cob salad and the wraps are great too. I saw how well organized they were and assumed it was a chain but they are family owned and super friendly. You're going to be impressed!"}
{"text":"These guys make a damn good salad. I also had their chicken ceasar wrap on a spinach wrap. The veggies were so incredibly fresh. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the staff was incredibly friendly and all smiles.  And they cater! I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I always look forward to Crisp Greens! I actually have cravings fort knightly! Today I had to be on the road for a bit and it was going to be difficult to eat my salad in the car. Brandon who was preparing salad suggested he put it in a wrap! Problem solved - Wrap delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to meet my dad for lunch in the Chandler area. The salads are delicious - good portion sizes, lots of options, ingredients taste fresh, super tasty dressings. A couple of months ago I noticed that the lettuce to topping ratio seemed to favor the lettuce side. But the portions of toppings seems to have gotten better. It's not just salads here - you can get anything in a wrap and they also have smoothies. The customer service has always been great. The only thing that could make this restaurant better (for me) is if they offered organic produce. The ambiance is clean and cute. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious and so fresh! Today I'm having the Crisp Cobb Salad: romaine, kale, avocado  , egg  , bacon , red onion, tomatoes  and blue cheese with chicken  and mustard agave dressing. If you are local and have not tried Crisp Greens yet, you should! Parking is limited but park in the lot about 1 block to the north on AZ Avenue."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a chopped salad place. Don't live in this part of town, but found after business meeting.  Had blue cherry salad with kale.  Larger than I expected and plenty of the little yummy bites of cheese, cherries and walnuts in every bite.  Staff was friendly and place was clean.  The only thing that would make it better was a larger piece of fresh thicker bread.  Will visit again"}
{"text":"This was one of the best salads I've had in a long time. They have a great selection of pre-designed salads, as well as the ability to create your own from all of their ingredients. The ingredient list is awesome. This is definitely a place I will hit up again and again."}
{"text":"We ordered some Chicken Tortilla Soup to go. It was delicious, I could've eaten 2 bowls by myself. They have a unique menu, panini's, salads, gelato, fresh juices. I'll definitely be back to try some more."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while out shopping with my daughter. We both are trying to eat healthier and support local businesses whenever we can. This place was amazing! Good selection? of salads and Panini's. Fresh  made drinks. You can choose your protein. Their tofu is to die for even if you don't like tofu. They marinate it and it is so flavorful. I was really happy with my meal. They get their produce and stuff locally. It showed because the greens were actually crisp. The staff is great they answer your questions, make suggestions and are very attentive. I will be back for sure. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their CrispZONA salad is delicious, I especially loved the lime-cilantro vinaigrette! It's a must try place!"}
{"text":"I went to Crisp Greens with co-workers after a meeting. It was not busy at all and there were about 5 of us that ordered. Then, a few more customers came in. It took about 30 minutes to get our orders. There were only 2 workers.   Once I got back to work and opened up my salad, I came to find NO STEAK in my salad that I paid an extra $3 for. I was so disappointed. I called and the manager apologized and I'll get a salad for free my next visit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here today. I had a craving for a good salad and they did not disappoint. I told the associate it was my first time in and I wanted a little help picking something our. He recommended the Cobb salad. I'm not a huge cobb fan and then he said well you can also create your own salad or just sub what you don't want for something else on the Cobb salad and that's what I did. It was delicious!! I also go the green smoothie and some gelato. I'm too stuffed to eat the gelato but the salad and smoothie were great. They were also extremely affordable. I spent $9 on a salad that I would have spent 15-20 on at a restaurant and I got more chicken and fresher veggies. The smoothie was also only $5.50! The staff was extremely welcoming and happy to help! They're local, super nice and have FRESH FOOD that's good for you. Doesn't get much better. I'm looking forward to going back!"}
