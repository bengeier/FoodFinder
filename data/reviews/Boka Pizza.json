{"text":"We came here after an event downtown with our boys. Pizza tastes great (a little oily) and the staff is very friendly. We ordered a cookie and I think they forgot it in the oven and it got burnt lol they offered us a brownie instead so we took it. No restroom inside, but there is one outside on the other side of the flag store. We liked it and if in the area, we will stop by again."}
{"text":"I very rarely give 5 stars 4 is usually average tops for a great place I've only ordered from here once but I was not disatisfied with price or food all in all I'll order from hear again great place for early turn in food on a work week had philly was great wife had Cobb salad she wasn't bitching so like ice cube said today was a good day!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! This place is the absolute worst. I ordered a chicken sandwich and not only did it take forever to come out but it was so charred it was inedible. I thought about complaining but the server was rude when I was ordering so I didn't want the hassle. We won't be back. Brick is kitty corner to this place has pizza and beer and is a million times better."}
{"text":"Whoa. Just tried your place for the first time. Ordered and paid online. My sandwich was ready and waiting and is so good. I ordered the Boka Italian Sandwich. It puts the Sub*** place to shame. Yeah, you'll be seeing me again!"}
{"text":"Boka Pizza is a pretty cool place. You get to create your own pizza from lots of ingredients. It usually works out pretty well, but I was lucky enough to come in when this girl named Katie was working. I asked her to make me her favorite pizza. Changed my life. Best pizza I have ever had, the world over. I recommend everybody stop what they are doing immediately and head over and try a Katie-pie!   -Chris"}
{"text":"Found Boka randomly one day, and has been one of my favorite pizza places since! The servers and friendly. I've met the owner a couple times and he is joyfully friendly as well! The Pizza is delicious and there are many choices! There is a little wait because they cook in a brick in an oven but it's well worth the wait! Also, they have great prices on beer! So grab a beer while you wait for your pizza to cook and hang out! Love this place!"}
{"text":"No Stars.. Yelp forced me to rate this!! Where do I start with this God awful place...let me begin with I downloaded Yelp just to do this review. Went on a Sunday afternoon with my daughter thinking it would be fun to \"create\" a pizza for 7.99. The place was filthy. There were two people sitting at two different tables. All the other 7 table were dirty. Napkins, soda cups, pizza plates on each table. Waited in line for 25/30 min. While only two people were in front of me. This place has signage all over stating that your pizza takes only 5 minutes to make. NOT TRUE! There was one young girl working her butt off making pizzas and cashiering, she obviously needed another assistant to help her. She asked me what I would like to get I said a 10 inch.. She than walked away and started boxing up other pizzas for other customers. She came back to me 4 min later. She did this twice. When she proceeded to finally make my pizza she took the the dough out of the refrigerator and with her unwashed hands that she had just used to take money proceeded to knead my pizza dough.. I told her to put gloves on and she said ok. Then with her gloves she turned around and took out another pizza which now made the gloves dirty again.. I was irritated and pissed so I left, and I wasn't the only one who left the two ladies behind me left as well.. I went down the way to Brick where I should have gone in the first place. Pizza at Brick was amazing.. Service was wonderful and I will NEVER go back to Boka.. What a shame since I live downtown & this place could of been cool. Management/owner stop being stingy and hire more workers and school your employees on food health regulations. I did post this to my Facebook.. Hope to get the word out to ALL my downtown friends to stay away from this establishment.  *********Side Note****** Boka pizza did respond to this review several months later and I thought that this was nice of them. Even though my experience wasn't the greatest it was nice of them to offer me to come back to check out the service. Thank you! ******"}
{"text":"Boka is the tale of two pizzas, with their slices being the best of times and their personal pizzas being the worst. I used to frequent this place for their slices for years before they switched their menu around. I've heard they did it to offer a more consistent pizza (slices could be sitting out for who knows how long), but the only consistency in the personal pizzas is that they are consistently bad.   During lunch time, you'll find a pretty darn good New York slice. Boka's pizza is defined by their somewhat unique sauce which really packs a heavily seasoned punch. It's a very strong flavor which features a lot of oregano and garlic. It may turn some people away, but for others it'll be a reason to keep coming back. The cheese and crust aren't particularly noteworthy. Occasionally they detract from the pizza if there's too much cheese or the crust is slightly burnt and crispy, but generally this is a solid slice of pizza. Given that there aren't many places doing slices well, it's a welcome addition to the Phoenix pizza scene.   However, if you come in outside of lunch hours, you'll be treated to an abomination of a personal pizza. That's right, no slices outside of lunch hours. Instead, you're given a personal pizza with crust that isn't stretched quite far enough and consistently overloaded with cheese. The strong sauce flavor returns but it's buried in a mess of soggy pizza which loves to fall apart under it's own weight. Boka loves to brush on a layer of garlic/oil on the crust on both their slices and the personals, but here it just feeds into the mess of grease dripping all over the table. It's not like this pizza is unfixable- A thinner wider crust with a better ration of crust-to-cheese-to-sauce would likely replicate the flavor of their decent slices. At the moment, I'm consistently disappointed by this pizza. Sure, it's one price for as many toppings as your care to add, but with a crust that is already overloaded, you're only doing yourself harm by piling it high.   There's a place that does personal pizzas well downtown- Pizza Studio is a chain place a short walk away that offers a much better version that is well balanced and tasty. I really don't know why Boka threw the towel in on their slices to offer a less competitive version of a personal pizza.   There's not a lot of good places serving pizza by the slice, and outside of lunch time there's one less. If you're not coming in for the slices, don't bother coming in."}
{"text":"I ate boneless wings and a side salad. Was not too pricey. Food was what was expected and I enjoyed it. I recommend the wings even though it is a pizza place. My husband had the bone in wings and he liked them and was full off of them."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and familiarize yourself with the combinations it can be a great pizza if you add the right combinations otherwise you might be left with a pizza you're not satisfied with. Crust I thought was a little soggy maybe perhaps they didn't leave it in the oven long enough overall a regular pepperoni pie can me a really good experience.,  especially if they serve it by the slice. They have bacon as a topping so that's a plus.. atmosphere was pleasant in a courtyard downtown phoenix, although space was a little tight."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay! Went at 9:30pm on a Friday night after leaving a movie at AMC! I did not care for the $2 peanut butter cookie!"}
{"text":"I have the pleasure of visiting this spot at least once a month for lunch. Love the personal pizzas; fair price and delicious. Best of all is the friendly service. I was just in today and had a blast with the staff and another customer. Inside joke: #finelygrounded #newbie #meatpowder"}
{"text":"Was skeptical of this place. Tried to decide between here and the bakery a couple does down. I'm glad I went here. Pizza was really tasty. I got buffalo style sauce with bacon, sausage, peppers and basil. For 8 bucks it was legit. All the toppings you want. I added a garlic knot and a Coke and got out of there for about 11 bucks. I'd definitely go back on a lunch break or quick bite on the weekends."}
{"text":"So I went to the Boka Pizza in Pheonix Az, I ordered a meatball sandwich. It was not busy when I ordered my food. 5 min after I ordered that is when it got busy. I waited over 30 min for my sandwich just to get everything burnt on this thing. Yeah I wasn't going to eat that. Good thing I got a refund.   My friends got the personal pizzas and thoes were slightly burnt as well.  Going to Boka was a waste of my time. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Very helpful and very friendly. I am happy to say that I will recommend Boka Pizza to friends and family."}
{"text":"Really great food, very friendly staff, and absolutely phenomenal owners. This place really cares about their customers and guests and they show it in their food, customer service, and the energy in this place is wonderful, warm, friendly, and inviting. It feels like home. :) I definitely want to visit their establishment again in the future. Thank you Boka Pizza for your kindness and good customer service."}
{"text":"Service is below average. They didn't mention ASU discount. They don't have a restroom or a way at least to wash my hands before eating. The cashier was not helpful and seemed slow. Food is average. They leave the front doors open at night in winter so it gets chilly inside. Prices are okay. I'll probably go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I think the pizza here is great! Look forward to going several times a week. Meat lovers is awesome."}
{"text":"Boka Pizza is my favorite pizza place hands down.Always great service, great product and they deliver!! I also enjoy having pizza at the Arizona center and then taking in a movie afterwards...five stars From me guys, for sure....thank you..."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery using their online ordering system. 2 hours went by, and no pizza came and no one called. I finally called them, and they said we were out of their delivery zone and that our order would have to be refunded. (We are 1.3 miles away.) That would have been great to know 2 hours ago."}
{"text":"Just got done with Comicon and decided to eat pizza. Bad idea. No ice in the vending machine. No garlic rolls. Topping on pizzas are $2.50 per topping (if they have it). Worst food experience ever."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up... a large pizza (which is huge by the way.. 20\") and some hot boneless wings. The pizza was so damn good! NY style which is just how I like it.. great crust and perfect amount of toppings. The boneless wings were pretty good also. I ordered hot and it was just right.. Not too hot but just enough. The only thing that could have been better is if I came to pick it up earlier. On the phone I was told 25-30 minutes.. I showed up in about 30-35 and I could tell the food was done like 15 minutes before.. the sauce was already dry on the wings and the pizza wasn't hot, but we still loved it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is AMAZING. And the fact you can pick as many toppings as you want and keep the same price is awesome. The wings were a dissapointment. I've tried the honey bbq and the hot on two different occasions and they were either oikyor overpowering on sauce and not in a good way but honestly the pizza is so good I don't even need wings. The reason my star rating is so low is because the service is horrendous. The night crew doesn't even try to hide they don't care about their job.  There rude as hell,  never know if there wing guy is there??  Twice I've gone and there just like uh idk if we can get wings right now idk if he's here. The cook shouldn't also be the delivery guy that's ridiculous. Also I've been wanting to try garlic knots but everytime I go they always says they are out. They are just rude and act annoyed at everything and it makes guests uncomfortable. I've only had problems with the night staff,  the other times I've gone in the day time have been okay."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parmesan sandwiches last night.After taking over twenty minutes to get, with only two other customers, I have to say I've had better. Chicken was WAY overcooked. I love my garlic, but even this had way too much. Would have been great had it been done right."}
{"text":"I should have done better 'due diligence' on the front end and maybe never have walked in here to begin with.  It is hard to be a pizza joint in this part of town considering all the outstanding competition in the neighborhood too.  Everything looked pre-made and not fresh.  All the pizzas were preheated with toppings on them ready to go, before you even get there, then they fire it in an oven when a pizza is ordered.    Since the pizzas didn't look particularly appetizing, I had asked about substituting capicola (which was on another sub on the menu) for the ham on the Italian sub and the server said they were already pre-prepared.  I opted for the barbeque chicken pizza the gentleman at the counter suggested.  The crust was not good; it was kind of like Boboli bread.  The servers were nice, but unfortunately I can not say the same for the food."}
{"text":"The best boneless chicken wings! Great salads! Great staff! I eat here a few times a week!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken? NOT so buffalo chicken. Burnt, hard bread. Ordered no specific ingredients, those were on it.  Pizza was greasy and not so good."}
{"text":"I will serve the pizza rolls full of uncooked dough and when took it back to the counter I was told thats the way they come by the male cook and I wasn't offered a refund or another pizza roll because the one I have is clearly unedible"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. Today was my first time eating at Boka Pizza as this is my first day working downtown. Darius took my order and was nice and inviting being a first time customer. When I opened my order once I got back to work I realized it was all wrong. I ordered the cheese steak and asked for no mushrooms on it. It was mainly loaded with veggies with a lot of mushrooms. I figured well at least I have onion ring I get to enjoy only to find out that they gave me fries which were mostly soggy and uncooked. I also got to the bottom of my root beer to find little hard black plastic like specks. I only noticed them after feeling them in my mouth and in my throat. I have no idea what they were and I generally would not gripe so much but the fact I paid $15.19 for a drink half sandwich and onions rings is outrageously stupid. Needless to say I will never go back there nor will I ever promote this place of business since they cannot read a receipt, listen to customers and have no level of cleanliness with the crap I found down in my drink. I think I will also be giving the health dept. a call since I don't know what I ingested."}
{"text":"I just got a call from the manager and he could not have been nicer. He agreed that my order was handled incorrectly and wants so much to prove to me that what I had heard about his place and what had driven me to make the order was absolutely correct. Unfortunately,  stuff does happen and it was my turn. I am updating my review because of Mike's sincere attitude on the phone - a 'what ever it takes to show me they are better tbat what I experienced'. Next trip - I'll give it another shot. Thanks Mike for reaching out!"}
{"text":"Great affordable fresh food at AZ Center. We showed up at lunchtime on a weekday with a field trip group of 17 high schoolers. Angela, the owner, was very kind and accommodating, and made sure we were taken care of. We let her know what our budget was from our school and she made sure we had plenty to eat and stayed below our budget. The pizza was very good - a perfect combo of crispy and chewy crust, and fresh ingredients. I suggest the garlic & butter sauce with basil, chicken & tomatoes. The supreme was also good. The kids loved it and we had a great time. We are so happy we decided to go with a locally owned restaurant  with hot fresh food rather than going to the processed food chain right next door."}
{"text":"The build your own pizza is a great concept. Considering you build it right there, the wait wasn't long. It was in expensive which is also great! However the pizza was very greasy. I expect a certain amount considering it's pizza but to the point my crust was soggy. The taste wasn't the best I've ever had and it would have been better if it wasn't so greasy."}
{"text":"We stopped in after the symphony on a Friday night a few weeks ago.  Offers friendly service, average pizza and no bathrooms!"}
{"text":"A group of us wanted to grab a quick bite before heading to the theatre for a movie. The place was empty when we arrived. I wanted to like this place because the guy behind the counter was nice, but my pizza was not great. Generally, I'm not a fan of \"choose your own\" restaurants because I feel that I should not have to do half of the cooking for the restaurant! I go out to eat to save myself the trouble of selecting ingredients.   I chose the small, i.e. personal size pizza, marinara sauce, pineapple, ham, and onion. It cost about $7.50. When I got my pizza, it was quite greasy. It was so greasy that my hands felt soft and moisturized, like a baby's bum...or something like that. The crust was soggy and overall, I was underwhelmed. But, I was hungry. So I ate my whole pizza. Pig.   Boka Pizza also offers HUGE chocolate chip cookies and (not as huge) brownies, both of which are baked onsite. So, I ordered a cookie and it was really good.  In conclusion, go for the cookies, not the pizza....unless you want soft hands."}
{"text":"Food took 40 minutes and we were the only ones waiting. And then on top of that, it was made wrong. Not worth $25 for this pizza and I wish I would of went to little Caesars instead and saved $20 and my time for the same quality pizza"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give Boka Pizza another chance. Wasted time. First, try to figure out how much a pizza will cost you from the muddled menu board above the counter.  Forget it. You can't.  I wound up ordering a ten inch pepperoni and fresh mushroom pizza and a side salad. Also saw Amber ale, so went for that, too. All told, about fifteen bucks.  Found a table that had been spotted down, finally, and took a seat, and waited for the salad and pizza to be brought out.   The salad was the best of what I got. Of a decent size, it was premade and packaged. There was a chunk of the inedible lettuce core included. The pizza was chewy and greasy and very salty. The beer, it turned out, was from Mexico, and not what I expected at all; very bitter.  I give up. There is better pizza to be found downtown."}
{"text":"I came in this week to grab a quick slice in between meetings. I love pizza - any kind. When I've had a busy schedule at work, I usually come in and grab a slice and sometimes get it cold because I'm moving so quickly.  I was surprised to find your new made to order format.  I was short on time but gave it a try.    Pros: 1) I love that you can get as many toppings as you want for the same price.  That's awesome. 2) Coke products - yay!  great choice. 3) The pizza was really good.  It hit the spot.    Cons: 1) There are no grab and go options. You have to order and wait for it. I went after 1pm but I imagine there is a long line at noon.  It takes a full 5 minutes to cook. I wanted it to go and then I had to wait for them to box up. Seems silly to complain about another minute but I just wanted to go fast. 2) cost - pizza and a drink was over $10.  I usually came in for a slice and a drink for $5. I recommend that you consider some type of cheaper option for the lunch crowd if you are going to make this work.  Maybe a smaller pizza size for $5? I know your audience is not kids but a smaller size would work for that population too.  I'd love to see you make this work because a slice of pizza during the work day is my preference for lunch. I was excited to see a place to get slices when I took this position downtown.   LOVE the coca cola products (I used to go next door for a coke). Big plus!"}
{"text":"The lg pizza is Huge!! The crust is thin and crispy. The pizza sauce is very tasty. It's a build ur own pizza place so thats cool. Loved it."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good service. Loved eating outside & watching the game! I go once a year when my daughter dances at the Sheraton.  Check it out, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"The pizza and wings were really good except it was probably the most greasiest pizza I have ever eaten. So greasy, it went through the wax paper and the box. They have a cool little patio on nice days. Also, the website says they serve beer. But there is actually no alcohol there. Only soda."}
{"text":"This place won some award for their cheese pizza (\"plain cheese pizza\" in the words of Kevin McAllister). That's normally what I get here, as there is a lot of flavor going on, even with just the sauce and the cheese. The crust also seems a lot more interesting than that of Pizza People (which is flat and plain), with a more bread-like texture."}
{"text":"Great pizza, Friendly staff. Definitely recommend for grab and go situations. It's make your own so you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Appearance: Nothing fancy. It was dead when we visited, but the tables all seemed to be dirty. Despite observing dirty surfaces, the two guys working were dusting and wiping other (non-dining) areas down (signs, walls, etc.) so maybe they got to them after we left, although I think the tables should have been priorty. The kitchen and prep/line surfaces appeared clean.   Food: We ordered a pizza, a Mediterranean salad, and the BBQ spicy boneless wings. Wing flavor was great! Wings were cooked nicely and served hot. Pizza was good, but nothing special. Salad consisted of tomatoes and red onion on a bed of spinach, with feta cheese. Very boring and lacking flavor. Vinaigrette dressing and raspberry dressing were not balanced, feta cheese was super dry.   Service: Helpful employees, good recommendation for the pizza. Both were friendly, polite, and knowledgeable. Ordering process was fast, food was delivered quickly."}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic and the servers were very friendly. Hands down one of the best pizza places I have eaten at in years."}
{"text":"They work really hard but ain't really familiar with online order. I went to restaurant to pick up but made me wait another 20 mins. And 'we don't have any online order..' Haha  Don't use online order feature. You will waste your time."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. I will definitely be stopping in again soon for a pie. Thanks for listening"}
{"text":"Should be a zero star. This place ran out of ice and said to the customers, they aren't going to fill it. Great, how about you tell me BEFORE I've paid for my drink? Don't list your toppings, if more than half of them are unavailable. Tell me before I start ordering that the most popular toppings are out! Complete idiots that work here. Who's in charge of inventory? How do you run out of toppings? Don't eat here. You're better off eating a handful of dirt.   Terrible. Several other customers complained that they waited an hour and a half for their pizza bc they forgot to make it. Clowns that work here. It's a circus."}
{"text":"I order a 20\" boka supreme with light sauce and 6 mild wings. It was delivered by ubereats. So my pizza came with sauce oozing from everywhere. I will assume that the pizza comes more sauce then how I ordered it. The pizza was not cut which was very disappointing, I had to use my own pizza cutter. How do you forget to cut the damn thing!!! The wings, well mine where all drum sticks and no wings and I prefer the wings over the drum sticks and to top it all of they came with no sauce. I didn't eat them, but my dog seemed to enjoyed them. I was disappointed and I would order the wings for my dog since I don't think they could screw that up."}
{"text":"I ordered the supreme pizza and boneless wings through UberEats. Not only did I receive only 6 wings, instead of the 8 that I paid for but they were absolutely disgusting. I don't even think that I would call it a chicken wing. It was just deep fried breading that tasted horrible. The pizza left a lot to be desired. It came in a very soggy crust and honestly, it didn't look fresh. I will not be ordering or trying out this establishment again. Really disappointed. But I should have known better since their rating here is only 3 stars."}
{"text":"This places rules. First off, great pizza. Yummy ingredients. Fair prices. And super friendly service!! It was my first time here and the guy behind the counter was incredibly friendly and funny!   Definitely try the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast.  That's about all I can say.  My pizza was literally soaked in grease.  I couldn't even pick up a slice with my hands because it basically disintegrating from being so saturated with grease and oil.  Pretty gross."}
{"text":"awsome...awsome...awsome...once u eat here u will make it ur fav place to come back to ...childhood friends with the owners and they are family greatness...i know u will enjoy this as much as i do....sweetness..."}
{"text":"Here from out of town for a conference. Can't say much for the atmosphere, it's pretty basic and unremarkable. The pizza, on the other hand, was excellent. Flavorful crust with the right balance of crisp and soft, nice tangy sauce, pepperoni with just the right amount of spicyness. I came for a second visit while I was here."}
{"text":"Just remember that pizza is in the restaurant's name; you shouldn't order a sandwich during lunch time. They take too long!  My two friends thoroughly enjoyed their pizza's, but my meatball sandwich came out about the time they were done eating.  The sandwich was pretty tasty,  but was a little dry and needed some more marinara sauce.  I might come back another time to try the pizza.  It's a build your own concept, and looks pretty good!"}
{"text":"Apparently this 'pizza place' doesn't serve slices of pizza. I will never understand that concept. Cleanliness was OK, a little better than when this was Roma Pizza, but they served slices. So this is worse."}
{"text":"This is my favorite downtown lunch slice.  And I seem to be alone on that (the place is never crowded)."}
{"text":"Long time user ... First time reviewer.  This is the worst.  To start, the place was empty which should have been a proverbial red flag but we were in a rush.  The server didn't know how to pour a beer so I watched her struggle for ten minutes (this is not an exaggeration. My wife ate her entire crappy pizza before my beer arrived) dumping head from the glass over and over.  She said \"this is how it always is.\"  I even asked if it would be easier to give me a different kind. She said \"no you will get your Bud.\"  The cook emerged from the back wearing the same gloves that he used to make the food and touched just about every surface in the place and then didn't change his gloves before making my food.  I expect diarrhea tonight as a result.  We ordered a \"garden salad\" but in this place the garden salad apparently has a side of cow even though the description listed just veggies.  We then had to argue with the server about whether the garden salad, listed on the menu as vegetarian, had meat as part of it.  I ordered the meatball sub which consisted of loose meat packed together sloppily on a bun.  Yuck.  The pizza was one notch above microwave quality.  Tombstone pizza alone in front of the TV might be better.  To top it off the aroma of bleach when we entered should have made us turn away quickly. We didn't.  Save yourself.  Stay away.  There was also a sign that said \"please Yelp us\" so that's just what I'm doing.  As an addendum- the owner replied to my post and acknowledged the problems.  I appreciate her willingness to take responsibility."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  They have a menu but the food is not available or thawing out..?!  The pizza is a bit pricey but it's OK.  It is possible to mess up pizza, but there pizza is edible.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this pizza place it is so delicious! They have amazing pizza and wings. Every time I go in the people are very nice and the food is delicious. There is a bit of a wait but it is worth it. Sometimes they forget some stuff but a friendly reminder they always are quick get it. Wings are also a good deal 8 boneless wings for 5.60.The pizza is still cooked in a oven and comes out warm. I would come to this place every time I go to downtown phx. ALSO! They did change it to kinda a \"pizza subway\". You get a 10\" pizza with unlimited toppings for 7.99 which is perfect size for a couple to share"}
{"text":"The other pizza joint in the area was closed so we tried this place. Great create your own system and menu choices. Cesar salad was generic. They promote their crust more than anything because it's homemade by them. We had a pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza that was just way too greasy. They also don't serve you, they make you get up to get the pizza and salad. Crust was garlic based, but the pizza was still pretty good. Need a quick pizza, stop on by, but our experience was not the best."}
{"text":"Stopped by before a movie to have some dinner. I didn't know what to expect, but my son and I were in a pizza mood!!! This place does get a bit crowded. You have an option to create your own personal pizza or a big pizza to share. They also have other food options. I was a bit overwhelmed with their menu it was a little too busy for me however there was someone there to help me along the way. He gave me a run down of my options and what ingredients I could choose for my delicious pizza! Customer service was amazing!   The pizza was delicious! My son and I enjoyed it and finish every bit of it."}
{"text":"I came here because it was the only place open. For $8.50, you cant beat the personal pizza. The guy was super friendly as well. Great pizza for cheap"}
{"text":"The menu outside had a good looking veggie pasta dish so I went inside. I had an initial impression when I walked in, but my delicious meal changed my mind. There's a way I look at things. I remember when the South Park movie came out and it got panned. Here's the thing - Don't review South Park with the same perspective as reviewing North by Northwest. Boka Pizza is definitely on the divey side. Don't expect the best service... as both my waitress and bartender forgot to bring me water. The veggie pasta dish I ordered adding the chicken was delicious as was the side salad. Because the food was so good, I'm going to disregard any negatives. I do suggest the wait staff to write down orders though as they can be distracted by a customer's question as they're heading to put in the order. I do recommend the dish that I got and would return."}
{"text":"Interesting place. Here for lunch on a Tuesday noontime. They are out of Chiken Parm. The price for an Italian sandwich is 6.49 on the menu but rings up at 6.99. Cashier said she'd \"look into it \". What's to look into? It is right there. Staff is very friendly  while they rip you off. There are several better Pizza options downtown."}
{"text":"Slow service, bad pizza. The only good thing was they had 5 TVs and had the World Cup playing which we wanted to see. Other than that yuck. Pizza was greasy and undercooked."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I liked that they had ricotta cheese as an option. But no ice for the drinks was pretty hard to take."}
{"text":"Ordered ancient white and the honey bbq wings. The wings are amazing and I'm super glad we ordered them. Nice crunch to them but not drowning in breading, tasty sauce.   Could take or leave the mini pizza, but glad I tried it anyway."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to pizza place! All of the food is great-even the wings! The prices are very reasonable and there's a 10% discount for ASU students! It's really hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"I ordered wings and pizza thru Uber Eats...  Substituted their buttery garlic sauce for the red....  Delicious!!!!  I LOVE the crispy crust!!"}
{"text":"My initial review of Boka, was really a second review as I had let the first of two incidents pass without my disgrunteled opinion.  If I may, I would like to point out that few and far between, do you find an eatery who's owners genuinely care about the experiences of their customers and long time patrons. Mrs. Boka, immediately after I posted a negative review,  took it upon herself to get to the bottem of the issues in my complaint. Her appologies for the mishap were met with a comp and assurance that this would not happen again to me or any other customers.   I feel and have always felt, as significant as the quality of the product, is the quality of the service and her attentiveness and persistence to follow up and assure my satisfaction are rare and I appreciate it. Thanks again guys for making it right. Oh... And I came to find out Yelps delivery service were the ones who delayed my refund not Boka."}

{"text":"Dropped in after a movie and got a pizza. Wasn't sure what to order and asked for the pizza chef to make me his best pie. It was fantastic, perfect balance of meat and veggies with just a hint of heat. The dough is to die for, much better than other local build your own pizza places. If you stop by make sure to ask for the Lamar Special, they ought to put it on the menu!  Don't forget to get a cookie for dessert, they're baked on the spot and delivered piping hot with your pizza. Awesome pizza place!"}
{"text":"First off, this is the best pizza I've found within walking distance of the convention center. Second, the atmosphere is great. They play good music and the tables are always clean. The 10\" pizza is an amazing deal. For $7.99 you get as many toppings as you want, with a variety of sauces too. I introduced my wife to Boka Pizza and now she begs me to take her there. Thanks for the great food, at a great price!"}
