{"text":"I have visited a few times now and I have enjoyed the food every time.  The last visit I had to wait a bit too long for my drinks.  Waitress was talking with co-workers and texting, Manager was right there watching.. So we made our drink and dinner order at the same time...since we had plenty of time to look over the menu.  Smoked brisket is excellent (my favorite)."}
{"text":"No kidding.   AWESOME fajitas.   Reminded me of our years eating in TexMex places in around Houston.  Queso was yummy. Chips thin and warm. And, the service was friendly and fast.  Can't figure out why this place wasn't packed on a Friday night.  Probably all those knuckleheads waiting in line at Outback for a so-so steak.   Silly people."}
{"text":"the chori pollo is great, drinks are well made, staff is friendly i love the decor. the chips and salsa arent good but that ok it.is very much a tex-mex. i also tried the pork tacos they were great, and their version of the frioles charros are pretty good, will come back."}
{"text":"First time customer at this establishment. It is definitely an assembly line type service. The food was just okay. I was not a priority to the server because he was focused on getting those tips from the other tables. I do recommend they shop the industry market for a better quality beef strip which is used for the street tacos. The beef had 
the image of a grilled strip, but it tasted processed.  Yhe managers (2) on the floor were only focused on helping to take patrons orders. The salsa and chips need to be reinvented because the sauce was like tomato sauce wigh seasoning and ny the way, the he drink was great!!! Please work hard to improve.."}
{"text":"Me and my sister in law went  in an hour before closing today with our 3 children (3 and under ).  Julie served us with great patience and even suggested both of our meals. The kids enjoyed their food and we absolutely loveeeddddd our food. The drinks (also suggested by Julie) were AMAZING!!!  We had to share in this great experience because she made our night! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Stick with Chipotle: 

Not impressed at all. Lacked a lot of flavor, wasn't very appealing and dry. They need to use a different type of cheeses and sauce for enchiladas. I hate when Mexican restaurants use cheddar cheese instead of the good white Mexican cheese., and brown sauce instead of the red. We over heard the server say they were known for their brisket, so we ordered that bad the chicken tacos...both were dry, and my friend said the brisket was about as tough as leather. Wouldn't recommend...go next door to Genghis Grill."}
{"text":"I had a buy one get one entree coupon so we thought we would try this place . . . what a terrible place to eat! Salsa tasted terrible, very, very thin chips and the Chimmichanga was way over cooked and had absolutely no flavor and was hard to cut even with a knife and tasted like it was frozen and then deep fried.  I just couldn't understand why this place was packed on a Sunday night!  If you are looking for REALLY GOOD Mexican, go to Mi Pueblo.  I will never ever step foot back in Casa Rita's again!"}
{"text":"My first visit iturned into my last visit.

First off, I love Tex Mex food.  I've been eyeing this place, as I dine at the Genghis Grill next to it WAY too often.  So, I rolled the dice today and tried this place.

Waitress was friendly and chips, salsa and a Diet Coke arrived fairly quickly.  I ordered the #6 lunch combo, essentially chicken over a bed of rice topped with their queso sauce.  Sounds yummy, I though, as I've had it before at other Tex Mex places and LOVED it.  At other places I frequent, it's called ACP, which is Arroz Con Pollo; Spanish for chicken and rice.  

Sadly, the chips and salsa were the highlight of the dining experience.  The chips are very thin and the salsa is OK, if a little watery.  But they DID have flavor and were enjoyable as I waited for my lunch.  I had enough salsa for about half of the chips and stopped when my food arrived.

My food arrived, and I knew I was going to be disappointed by looking at it.  First off, they used shredded chicken instead of grilled chicken.  I wasn't given the option when I ordered, so I guess that's the default.  Secondly, the rice looked and tasted like it was left over from yesterday.  It was just mush on my plate.  If you looked for individual grains of rice, they were nowhere to be found.  But, still, there was this mush of \"rice\" under my shredded chicken and queso sauce.

I ate as much of the meal as I could, which was only about half of it.  I ran out of Diet Coke and sat there HOPING someone would notice I needed more.  I sat in a booth right next to the kitchen and runner after runner passed my table, but noone asked if I needed a refill.  My wiatress was assigned to a large group towards the back of the restaurant, so service suffered somewhat.  

I finally put my credit card on the table, and the waitress finally showed up and asked if everything was good.  I didn't complain, but I'm sure the look on my face told the story.  I just asked for my check.  The total was $10.70.  I left a $1.30 tip for a grand total of $12.00.  

I hope your experience is better, but I'll not be going back."}
{"text":"So far I've tried the brisket tacos and street style pork tacos. Both are fabulous! The service was wonderful and were eager to accommodate to my gluten free needs. In addition to their food, I've also tried several margaritas that are offered, all were excellent!"}
{"text":"This is the 4th time we've been to Casa Ritas and we are not impressed with the front end service. As soon as you walk in the hostesses taking your name are way too young and unexperienced and unfortunatelhy not very friendly. Two of the times we waited 25 minutes even though there were a mulitude of tables open. Both times we were seated in the way back even though we passed open tables in the main area. We asked to be moved to one of the available tables only be told we'd have to go on a wait again. It was ridiculous. We did sit at a high top in the main area, our server was good. We explained to him what happened and he seemed extremely confused as to why the hostesses weren't seating in available tables. The food came out timely as is fine. Management needs to step in get this place up to par."}
{"text":"Very good service, excellent food and margarita.  Sat at the bar, with Christine who sadly was serving her last day.  Their charro beans are really fantastic with chunks of bacon (yum!)  I tried a pork taco and needed very little accoutrements and a brisket chile relleno.  I asked about the quality of the brisket as I found many places just turn this type of meat into a hockey puck.  I was offered a sample and I was sold instantly, the poblano pepper large and stuffed to the max.  I also got to try a basil jalepeno margarita that is a fantastically complex delicious drink that I hope becomes a permanent fixture on the menu soon.  The menu isn't overloaded with Mexican style dishes, just simply well done plates.  Any if you like a bit of a kick, try the Street Sauce.  
The ambiance and decor is fun, clean, brightly lit with a couple TVs at the bar.  I saw patio seating as well as sectioned off restaurant seating.  I'm learning the Matthews area slowly and this will definitely be a regular stop for good food!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the service in this place!  I don't know anything about true TexMex. But the food would be so much better if you could get something besides refried beans and rice --these come with everything--unless you get fajitas, but then you have to choose between quac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Looking to try something new and this place was an immediate fail. 93.5 sanitation stood out in this fairly new establishment. The waitress walked my party of 2 pass multiple empty tables only to lead us to a dirty table. She said she would be right back to clean however she stopped off to chit chat and laugh multiple times leaving us standing over an uncleaned table. 

We were turned off by this time and decided to leave. On the way out we told the manager our concerns and he tried to justify their actions. 

No way to justify poor customer service and an untidy facility."}
{"text":"My brother and I just ate here and it was really good. We ordered the Pechuga Rellena. The food came out fast and our waitress,Erin, was very attentive. But don't take my word for it, come through and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Good food, but not top of the line. Love the portion size for the price! Not crowded especially at lunch, and really reliable takeout. The queso blanco gets hard quick. Especially love the saucy fajitas."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch for our first time. Not only was the decor just perfect, but the service from Emily and the fantastic food made us believers. We will definitely be back to try everything on the menu. Highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, the service was quick and the food came out perfectly and super hot. Emily recommended the slow cooked brisket burrito for my boyfriend and the bacon wrapped chicken medallions for me. By the end of the meal we could not have been happier to have picked such an awesome spot for lunch. Good job, Casa Rita's."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican Grill!   Their salsa is richer in color and flavor than most. It is spicy, but not overbearing.  Their Pico de Gallo was a bit spicy, but really good, and their chips are ultra thin - my favorite type!  
My entree was Baja Tilapia, and it was extremely good.  In addition to rice, it was served with Latin Stir Fry veggies (Cabbage, onion, thin strips of carrots, zucchini and broccoli - MUCH better than typical run-of-the-mill mixed veggies), black beans in a broth with onion (AWESOME) and pica de gallo on the side.   Quite honestly, I usually don't eat Tilapia often, but I remembered how good the tilapia was at another Mexican restaurant that I reviewed.  This was def. a great choice at Casa Rita's as well, and the garlic butter made it even better.  
The restaurant wasn't crowded when we went at 4:00 - but was beginning to pick up as we were leaving.  My Margarita was very good, and their draft beer is so cold, that the taps are covered with ice - which I should have gotten a picture of!  I will the next time I go....and there will DEFINITELY be a next time.   
The restaurant is located at Windsor Square Shopping Center, facing Independence Blvd."}
{"text":"First off this is by no means authentic Mexican food. Was looking forward to trying a new Mexican restaurant and was highly disappointed. The salsa they give you was really watery and is too spicy for children to eat which our waitress failed to mention. Our waitress was young somewhat friendly but more awkward. Food wasn't good, tacky decor and awkward service. First and last time"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here, we were seated right away and the service was super fast! Sierra order the strawberry and cream margarita and she loved it! The shrimp taco wasn't the best but everything else was delicious! Also the Guac in the triple dip was a bit different but good! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I think I thought this place was a chain.  Turns out it is...there are two locations, the other in Texas.  It sure is decked out like a chain.  That's mostly why I had been avoiding the place.

There is a lot to choose from on the menu, so we asked the waiter and he recommended brisket.  WOW.  This might be the best brisket I've ever had.

Equally important: They have a full bar and also serve an OK selection of Mexican beers.

Looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Why oh why have is the universe punishing me ???
Did I not eat here enough ??? Why did you close ??
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place !!   bring it back please pleaseeeeeee
I'm super pregnant  and need my salmon !
Plus what about the jobs of my favorite people ! This is a travesty ! Come back pleaseee!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here at 3:00 PM. Walked up to the door and I guess the manager was locking the door. He said they were closing! At 3:00 PM in the afternoon! No explanation or anything."}
{"text":"There is hardly a day that goes by where free chips and salsa and a giant mission-style burrito doesn't sound good. I'm always in the mood for good Mexican cuisine.... hell, even slightly bad Mexican cuisine. 

Casa Rita's, however? I just wish someone had informed us that the guy who owns the salt (and every other flavoring, spice mixture) had stayed home that day. Just about everything, minus the chips and salsa, lacked. Where you'd be hoping for a pop of cumin, garlic, onion, pork fat, whatever, it just wasn't there. The most disappointing part of our meal was the black beans. Our server, almost remorsefully, told us the only black beans they had were cold, canned beans. It was almost as if she had a raincloud over her head upon delivering sad news from the kitchen. However, with a glint of hope, she did mention they could microwave them for us! Oh, joy! Rapture! We are saved. Even though the lukewarm black beans were a welcomed sight, they failed to offer any hope of flavor. Sad day. 

Service was decent. A few too many people working with our table and not a single server truly seemed to know what was happening menu-wise or how customers typically like to be served -- cups typically filled and empty cups taken from the table. 

It was just a bit of a disappointment. Though we were famished and food was passable, I don't imagine we would return in the near future."}
{"text":"I've only been to Casa Rita's once, and I doubt I will be back. The restaurant is cute with festive decorations and a good bar, but the food was mediocre. I had the chicken burrito bowl which was horribly plain and our table of 6 all agreed that the Mexican rice tasted stale. Overall 3 stars because we had fast service."}
{"text":"It's not good. I ordered the pork tacos, and while the pork was delicious and tender, it was advertised on the menu as being \"street style\" but what arrived were flour tortillas. It was my mistake for not reading more closely, and they tasted fine, but the problem was the \"street style\" referred to them coming with onions and cilantro on the side. 

They did come on the side, of a plate so hot that I almost had a facial. The plate had spent time in an oven, then had fresh lettuce, onions, and cilantro plunked down... so it was almost like a fajita! Except that I didn't want cooked onions and cilantro. It also came with a lime. 

Fresh lime squirted on tacos is delicious. I managed to finally squeeze one drop from the shriveled lime I received. When I questioned the manager about the tacos and the hot plate he was very considerate and offered to replace the food, which was very nice.

My daughter ordered tea and received water.

We will never return. LaUnica is less than 7 miles away, and much much better for authentic street tacos."}
{"text":"Staff friendliness and service are the only reasons I gave this place two stars. I should have followed my gut feeling and passed on this place when I heard that it was a chain, but I will try just about anything once so I gave it a try. My fears were realized when I ordered the \"street tacos\" and was presented with two extremely dry chicken tacos with wilted cilantro and canned salsa. Okay Mexican food is easy to make, but when it's bad, it's really bad. Casa Rita's unfortunately, is really bad."}
{"text":"Fantastic Tex-Mex joint.  The Pechuga Rellena & Beef Brisket are both fantastic options.  Multiple drink options.  Service is A+...every time we have been, we have not waited more than a couple of minutes before one of the staff offers us a refill of chips & salsa.  Excellent options on the kids menu also."}
{"text":"Why coworkers did you make me come here??? Another chance to redeem themselves has failed. I ordered the fiesta salad and it was abysmal. Terrible. The chicken was cold and hard like it had been cooked then frozen and had only been out of the freezer for 2 minutes. I could not eat it. The salad itself was just not appetizing, I ended up dipping chips in the salad dressing and that was about all I could manage.  Coworkers dishes went unfinished too, the chicken on the fajitas looked just as gross. Chick fil a and Wendy's both have better southwestern salads.  I promise not to update this place again bc I am never going back I promise..."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit no matter what you get.  Fast service, friendly staff, mgrs know the regulars and engage in conversation.
  This is as true to Tex-Mex you are going to get.  décor is simple but pleasing.  This is a comfy place to go sit back, relax, enjoy food and drinks without feeling rushed or that you are a bother.
  They have a hot salsa that you have to ask for that is really good and has a bit of a kick.
  All ingredients are fresh and your order is made fresh to order.  

You gotta try this place!!!!

AMAZING is all I can say."}
{"text":"I came during lunch, but it didn't seem too busy. The servers seemed a little inattentive but that could also be because they're newly trained, so I'll forgive them on that front. 

I ordered the taco salad and while it was presented nicely, the taste was a little bland. The taco need they used was cooked well, but the combination with the shell, the lettuce, Guac, and pico, it just wasn't as appetizing as it sounded on the menu."}
{"text":"Sister-in-law and I decided to try this out yesterday. Inside was pretty, but I wasn't impressed with the food or service. 
We were seated in a booth, and waiter quickly came over (without saying anything to us) and moved the bench I was sitting on to make more room behind us. It was strange. He walked away then came back over and took our drink orders. We got out drinks then a few minutes later warm chips and salsa. Chips were excellent! Thin and salty! 
We were planning to order off the lunch menu since we went at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon. But the waiter walked over and informed us \"notice that only says Monday thru Friday until 3.\" Okay, maybe not the way to go about that, but okay. 
As someone who doesn't eat beef or shellfish, or pork (I'm picky I know.) I found there was not a lot of selection as far as vegetarian or chicken options go. 
My sister in law and I both got the chicken enchiladas with sour cream sauce. Not impressed. The tortillas were only corn. Sauce was almost sweet and seemed to have lemon in it. And my sister in laws next to last bite had a hair in it! 
We only saw our waiter once after getting our food and then he came back to bring the check. 
Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Read the reviews, but instinct brought us here anyway. SO GLAD WE CAME! We are originally from Texas and currently live North of Atlanta. Let's just say, good Tex-Mex is hard to find. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. Pleasant surprise!!!"}
{"text":"As anyone can tell by my previous reviews I love Mexican food so I  had to check this spot out. The chips and salsa weren't bad the chips were warm and the salsa was decent. I ordered the vegetarian quesadilla which wasn't mind blowing but wasn't terrible. Now if you want a great drink try the Mango Tango that was pretty tasty! I would just say this is your average Americanized Tex Mex place not particularly good not particularly bad just average.f."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and we were pretty disappointed.  Our server was really friendly and offered suggestions since it was our first time.  The chips that came out were that thin, super salted and see through greasy kind.  Big thumbs down.  Food platters wee pretty large but not impressive to taste.  Pricey and not good quality in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was... Ehh? We came on a Thursday evening when nobody was there. Still our service was lacking- no refills & sat with the menu forever.i suggest if you want a good meal at a decent price walk over to Azteca ( it's right next door). You will pay the same amount we did at Casa Rita's & get more food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My fiancé and come all the time. What is really great, we get a coupon in the mail for boy one get one free. Great food (enchiladas burritos tacos etc...)"}
{"text":"I couldn't help but compare Casa Rita's to my recently reunited-with flame, Chuy's. Casa Rita's just couldn't live up to the Tex Mex I had there about a week ago. Their delishTex Mex was still so fresh in my mind. Maybe if it wasn't, I would've liked Casa Rita's better? No matter really.

The food was blah all around - lacking flavor, spice or anything nice. I would rather go to Chipotle if forced to find Mexican in the Matthews area. 

I tried the fajita salad, the salad part was \"fine\" but the avocado ranch was really just ranch and the accoutrements (pico de gallo, guac) were bland like everything else. 

The chicken was super meh - like it was full of preservatives or something. Not a piece of fresh chicken breast like I would expect...more like fast food chicken. 

My husband got the brisket street tacos and he liked the brisket but said everything else on his plate was bland. I tried the charro beans, huge disappointment!

The only pleasant surprise was the tortillas appeared to be homemade. Made there? Doubt it, but not straight from Harris Teeter. 

Highly unlikely that I will return!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa, thin and crispy service was a bit patchy and it took longer then I think it should. Very friendly and the food was good and plentiful."}
{"text":"New place with fun decor. Service was good and the food was tasty. Kids meals need some bolstering- especially the kids nachos. (4 nachos and rice for $5 doesn't seem right.) I'll come back to sample more menu items."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've found in Charlotte that makes their own flour tortillas.  The food is great authentic Tex-Mex, and the decor is spot on.

I'd recommend the brisket tacos, bacon wrapped shrimp, the sopapillas, and the Tex-Mex martini."}
{"text":"Really surprised based on previous reviews.  Sat in bar area and had lightening fast service from Trent the bartender.  A server delivered chips and salsa immediately and the chips were fresh and the salsa was very mild.  House margarita was great. Ordered street tacos with chicken and They were delivered less than 5 minutes later.  The sides (lettuce, onion) could have been a little more robust, but overall they were good.  The fiery sauce is very hot, but they serve it on the side.  Overall. A great experience and I would come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Arroz con pollo is highly recommended. Good food, drinks and service. Full bar and lots of tvs."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place and were pleasantly surprised. The pricing is cheap compared to the amount of food you get. I had the chicken fajita salad and it was huge. The salad itself had all the goodies of a salad plus sour cream, guacamole, and pico. The chicken came on a separate sizzling fajita plate, which was a nice touch. It was delicious! (Although there were a ton of onions and only three small slivers of pepper). No worries, I figured they must have run low. Service was excellent. Chips and salsa arrive as soon as you sit down. Waitress was super nice and attentive. All salsa is made in house (we tried the mild and the hot) and the queso was good. We didn't have an entree over $10 and this food was well worth the money. 
Staff was friendly from the moment we walked in until the time we left. Next time I'm trying their own in house tequila."}
{"text":"My Husband and I stopped in after his NASCAR Experience on Saturday night  
Very friendly staff. Our chips and salsa were very different  in a GOOD way! Smokier thinner salsa but very yummy   
He had chicken fajitas and it was fresh and juicy. Good guac and fresh pico . 
I had the brisket burrito  and it very good  but theres a ton of food! 
Overall Very good experience. The manager was exceptional   He was friendly, attentive and looked to have good report with the staff  
We would come back for sure  thanks Casa Ritas"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while now and I was very disappointed.  The staff was super nice, but the food well it wasn't good. We'll let me say what I had wasn't good.  I had the saucy burrito, and the sauce was the best part.  It wasn't good, I don't know what else to say.  The chips wasn't what I was expecting, the whole experience with the food was just bad."}
{"text":"I went here expecting a typical chain Mexican restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. Apparently it's family owned with another location in Texas, and the food tasted unique and authentic. I had a chicken breast stuffed with chorizo sausage and a cheese sauce and it was delicious. My wife's shrimp tacos were very good as was the rice, chips and pretty much everything else. Even the house margaritas were above average. The place was pretty busy and seemed to have a lot of regulars. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This new addition to the Tex-Mex scene is a solid, if not spectacular, one. Reading the menu would lead you to believe that they are a 30+ year old chain. Seems like there are a couple of them in Texas and this one in Matthews. Not that it matters much.

Probably the best part about the place is the service - very friendly. In fact, almost too friendly. While I appreciate being asked how the food is, I'd like to be able to have a few moments to try the food rather than having to answer so many people so that I can't try the food!

Speaking of which - the food is good, if not particularly memorable. The chips are thin. Too thin, in fact. If you get too much salsa on them, they'll break. Even sitting in the basket, they break (see picture of busted-up chips). All by themselves, they aren't bad - but try and scoop up some cheese or guacamole? Not with these chips. Salsas are not bad, but need a kick. Even the spicy isn't, though that's a judgment call, as some might like things on the mild side.

The proteins on the dish were good - Pechuga Rellena, a chicken breast medallion stuffed with chorizo and fried with panko (not sure that's Tex-Mex, but whatever), along with brisket tacos served on a chalupa sort of tortilla with special slaw turned out decent. But the rice and beans were really bland. I mean really bland. Could use some Emeril to give it all a kick-start.

Atmosphere was also decent, although that's to be expected, since it's new. Like the beans, rice and salsa, fairly nondescript and almost nothing stands out. A couple of televisions with football. Walking over to Azteca would probably give a better experience."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's Tex Mex, but it's the best Tex Mex! Just the freshest ingredients, and the smoked pork and brisket is to die for. 
Great salsa and chips, the nicest servers and the bartenders are the friendliest you'll meet.
All that being said, do not come here and not have Someone in Your Party get the Smoked Brisket. This is Tex Mex squared, and if you top it off with their margaritas, well......yep, You Have Died and gone to Heaven!
One more thing.... The best salsa and it's Endless, plus the chips are fresh and thin....,
Tex Mex Heaven!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after the boyfriend and I did the whole \"what do you want to eat.....oh. I don't care.....what do you want.....it doesn't matter\" game.

I have to say, my first impression was not that great.  There were lots of dirty tables, waitstaff rolling silverware at the bar (which should have been done either in the back of the house or in a section closed to guests), and trash on the floor around the restaurant (straw papers, paper napkin rings, printer slips from the server kiosks).

First impressions are everything.

Once I got past all that....I was fine.

The server we had was super sweet and really cute.  She provided us with excellent service and good suggestions on the menu.

Chips were light, thin, and crispy....salsa was tasty....and the queso was the bomb!

I also got a chicken dish that had bacon wrapped chicken medallions, pineapple and a mango sauce with Mexican rice and a side of beans and a side of fresh veggies.  Everything came out of the kitchen  piping hot, looking good, and tasting delicious.

Would I come back.....perhaps.....but I wish they would make more effort to keep tidy.  If the front of the house represents what the back of the house might be.....I dunno."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with my boyfriend, and every time has been a great experience. The staff is always super nice and helpful, and we enjoy the food and drinks here. The atmosphere is super chill and inviting. One of our favorite places to go to grab dinner."}
{"text":"Some friends and I ate here last night and the food was great, wait staff was very friendly.  The chips and salsa are great; thin, salty, crispy chips.  I had the steak fajitas which were awesome and my wife brisket tacos and we loved it.  

The restaurant was a little loud, hard to have conversation with the person across the table from you, but not terrible.  

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that after we finished eating we sat there having conversation for about another 30 minutes and the restaurant did not have people waiting to be seated, matter of fact they had several empty tables.  The server never came and refilled our drinks, all of which were empty shortly after paying.  Just thought that wasn't the best way to end what was otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"Was not thrilled! Service was fine, but this place is extremely American-ized.  The salsa is drab and flavorless.  The food is not my favorite. Just boring and disappointing! I had hoped for more spicy and flavorful dishes. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Fast and efficient service. Endless chips and  salsa. Salsa is mild but ok. The Texas Brisket in anything is fabulous! Unique and tasty and tender. We've had it a couple of times now - it's what separates them from competitors."}
{"text":"quick review: great tasting tex-mex. chips and salsa were very good and fresh. service was good. liked the atmosphere and comfortable booths. prices were ok. food was delicious and taste was better than expected."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far.  Service and food are really good.  Atmosphere is awesome as well.....especially in the very back of the restaurant with windows open!"}
{"text":"Arrived for dinner at 9pm Friday.  The 4 young hostesses seemed chatty and lost as we approached their area.  It was one of those situations where they all looked at each other like \"ok, which of us is going to do some work now and handle this next customer?\".  We asked for a booth and got seated in the bartender's section.  We saw her twice, when placing the order and when paying our check....otherwise she was busy making drinks the whole time and schmoozing for tips with drinkers at the bar. 

I ran out of salsa (great flavor btw) for my chips within 2 minutes.  The salsa bowls are deceptively shallow and you run out fast.  I had to wait over 10 minutes to get more, the desperate look on my face prompted help from another girl who wasn't even our waitress.

The food finally arrived and it was lackluster.  Dried out mexican rice, tough giant piece of brisket in the taco which tasted like pot roast since it wasn't shredded properly, came with no sauce or cheese (guess that's how they come?!?).  Fish tacos tasted bland, couldn't taste the fish and the slaw was boring.  Black beans were good but had bacon and jalapenos in them which was unique and tasty but got unexpectedly spicy very quickly.

So after a lackluster meal the bartender (waitress) finally make an appearance and asks in a super fake and forced voice if we want dessert....nah...\"to go containers and check please\".  After 10 more minutes of waiting shes up there bartending again and not wrapping us up.  Remind me why I ended up leaving you a pity tip?  I had more interaction with the 3 other people who came past my table when I needed something.  

The floor staff is full of highschool age kids more interested in flirting with each other than staying on task.  The atmosphere is horrible, this is literally the brightest lit restaurant I've ever been in.  It's like someone combined a bright, noisy sportsbar with a modern art Mexican theme and used a bad version of On The Border's menu.

If you like chain Tex-Mex food, goto On The Border off Providence and 485...they do it much better in every way.  If you like authentic Mexican food, goto Azteca next door or La Unica in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"Originally being from Ft. Worth, I completely appreciate the food at Casa Rita's - authentic TexMex in the tradition of the Mexican Inn. It has been open a little less than a year but it good. I love and miss brisket and I can get my fix here with their enchiladas and tacos.

If you get a chance to try it, get a side of the spicy slaw. It is a good bit spicy but it's great on the soft tacos or just as a side. House made salsa also makes this place an up and coming gem in town."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The decorates very tex-mex and very bright. The staff was friendly and quick. The food was amazing also. I had the queso Blanco and it was the perfect balance of melty and not runny. The brisket in the burrito was amazing also. I cant wait to go back so I can try other things!"}
{"text":"My children have been begging me to try this restaurant for at least six months. Never have I been so disappointed in a restaurant. They call themselves a Mexican Grill and some of the other reviewers have called it tex-mex, whichever you call it, the food sucks. I will say the service has been friendly although most of the staff seems aloof. Even my children won't eat the food. 

The chips and salsa- the chips taste like salted cardboard. The salsa is a paste of tomatoes and mild spices. 

My son's nachos and cheese- 4 nacho chips with shredded cheese melted into a waxy looking covering. He ate half of one chip and was done. 

Margarita- not the worst I've ever had but most definitely not the best. Over salted and watered down. I'm still questioning if there was actually tequila in it. 

Baja Tilapia- what can I say, I should've known better than to order this. The fish was over cooked and dry. I struggled to cut it. Luckily they gave me a cup of melted butter I could soak it in (if you didn't catch it, that was sarcasm).

I rely on yelp on a regular basis to help find good food. This restaurant by no means deserves 3.5 stars. I usually don't review restaurants but this was bad enough to warrant it. I'll make sure to reviewing restaurants that deserve the good reviews too!"}
{"text":"That was my first visit to Casa Rita's. My daughter and I both orderd the Fajitas. I had the shrimp and she had the steak and Shrimp. The yellow rice which came with the meal hardly had any taste to it. The plate it self was full of caramalized onions, and no exageration two pieces of grilled green pepper. The shrimps were over cooked. 
The service was less than average. Eventhough, the waitress was nice but we had to remind her each time we asked for something."}
{"text":"Just okay. My chicken enchiladas were nothing special. My fiancé got the Tampico had pretty good brisket, but the taco could have used something more. Over all he enjoyed it. Strawberries and cream margarita was REALLY good. Our server was one of the best I've had anywhere. She was really nice, I wish I'd caught her name..."}
{"text":"Brisket enchiladas....Yes please!

Visited for the first time last weekend and was really impressed!  The waitress recommended the Saltillo \"Texas Combo\" and it was a great meal.

The brisket enchilada was the highlight of the plate, closely followed by the Chicken Taquitos served with an excellent Avocado Chipotle sauce.

My wife got the house frozen margarita and really liked it.

Service was very attentive and friendly.  We cannot wait to go back to get more Tex-Mex!"}
{"text":"The margarias and the brisket tacos are amazing! Place hasn't been open long, but you couldn't tell. Staff was upbeat, TV's everywhere with all the games on. Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Really glad we stopped in tonight.  The brisket burrito, Chile rellano, pechuga rellano, and chimichanga were all amazing.  The beans and rice also great.  And the chips and salsa were phenomenal, nice light chips, great tasting salsa, get the white queso too!  Maria was a great server with awesome suggestions. Will definitely be back, thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Pretty Americanized environment, good service. Got the queso,  grilled chicken with the Latin stir fry. Prefer \"traditional\" Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Went for first time today. It won't be the last. My wife had the brisket tacos and I had the brisket burrito. They say they smoke their own and they do a really good job - super tender and smoky. Service was great. Seems a little more geared towards adults (OK with me). Very nice bar area."}
