{"text":"Awesome little terasse. The vegetarian pita was a bit too oily but still good. My fiancee had the Provencal sandwich and really enjoyed it as well. Relatively large portions. Service was nice. Would come again."}
{"text":"It's conveniently located on McGill College that attracts tourists in the weekend.  The outdoor terrace is nice and cozy.  Food and coffee are just average."}
{"text":"La petite terrasse était attirante au premier regard..mais la désillusion qui allait suivre n'en était que plus forte. Pour commencer, service de mauvaise qualité: serveuse froide, non souriante et erreur lors de la prise de commande. Soit. Passons. Ce qu'on demande à un resto, c'est surtout une bonne cuisine. Et là c'est le jackpot messieurs dames : Les frites étaient surcuites, quasiment grillées, les crevettes pannées sont composées à moitié de friture et la salade avait un gout de plastique Et pour finir: les prix sont absolument exhorbirtants. Une escroquerie à eviter."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal last weekend with my family. We all didn't know what we wanted to eat but wanted to go somewhere affordable and healthy (as well as somewhere that wasn't too packed and was family friendly). Thanks to Yelp, we stumbled upon this place. Judging from the menu outside, the prices seemed alright. We went in and was quickly greeted by a very nice server.   I tried the French onion soup (based on a Yelp review) and a chicken Cesar salad. Soup was good! Salad was good! Portion size was gooood! My family had sandwiches (which they said were okay) but the price was a bit much. My mom ordered the sundries tomato, cream, white wine pasta - it was okay. Being the most expensive dish, and the smallest, I expected a bit more. It wasn't that great.   All in all. It costed $100+ and tip for 5 people which I guess was okay. But you know how it goes when you're on vacay and trying to be cheap :P Nice experience, good food, prices are ehhh..., nice place for a little date. Would come back next time I'm in town to try out the other food items (like the desserts that were taunting me all night!)"}
{"text":"PROS:  1. Nice ambiance, relaxed, casual, classy, small, cozy. I'd consider it a good place to take my parents  (ie., not for the young'ns)  2. Servers were professional, quick and friendly.  CONS:  1.Food was comme ci comme ca.  I had a stuffed pasta thingy-ma-bobber that I wasn't too fond of. Next time I would get a meatier dish or salad which I noticed a lot of the other customers were later raving about.   OVERALL:  -If I were to consider a restaurant for bistro food, Le Cap Vert would NOT be my first thought because I know I could get better bistro food in Old Port. However, if I'm stuck on St Cat's it's not a bad choice compared to a generic 3 brasseurs."}
{"text":"Went to this cozy Bistro that has been around for ages. I had the soup of the day with hot goat cheese salad which was good! My friend had a chicken sandwich with a salad. She remarked that it was quite dry! Ended it with a cappuccino! I would go back!"}
{"text":"I love the terrace on this place, right in the middle of the action on McGill College. This is an excellent place to have lunch or supper. The lunch menu's are always well inspired and the they always have good wines picked out. The mussel salad I had was exquisite and top that off with a nice biere chevelle blanc and I was in heaven. This is the terrace to be on a warm Montreal summer, absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Have gone to this twice in the evening because a friend really liked this café.  It's rather quiet at night and it's great if you want to have the place to yourself. The food is French fare, portions are pretty good. It's more on the pricey end. Had the flat sandwiches and an entrée and both were quite good."}
{"text":"Small and quaint with friendly service. We had a few special requests all of which were accommodated. The food was fresh, well prepared and tasty."}
{"text":"Had a lovely duck confit salad & ricotta pasta. My salad was fresh, the endives crisp, and the duck was perfectly crispy.  Service was warm and friendly.   It was a cold day so the terrace was not an option but it was still a lovely view by the window.   Quiet, cute spot for casual dinner."}
{"text":"Nice little bistro at the heart of downtown Montreal. The menu is small and does not suit to all. There is not much for kids to eat here, so if you have Kids avoid at all costs.  I came here with a friend, to have a nice little meal before a movie; we ended up eating again at the theater which is just across the street. Meals at cap vert don't fill you up. The food is good but my \"meal size\" cesar salad which looks big , but doesn't fill you up.  If you are hungry and want meat this is not a restaurant you want to choose. Cap vert is meant for light meals.   The restaurant is small with a few tables, service is decent and the waiters are friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on our last day in Montreal. Had the best French Onion Soup! Moved on to a Chicken Salad that looked like too much but managed to enjoy it all. My associate had the soup of the day and wanted to lick the bowl. She followed it with a chicken cutlet with veggies. She kept commenting on how thin and delicious the chicken breast was.  We followed with espresso and chocolate lava-ish cake and vanilla ice cream and streaks of strawberry. So tasty.  Our server was so gracious, professional and relaxed at the same time. A rare combination. She chatted with us about our visit since we were almost the last of the lunch crowd. We felt so at home!"}
{"text":"My sister decided to take me to Bistro Le Cap Vert for an afternoon coffee.  It was a beautiful day to sit out on the terrace which was surrounded by flowers to enjoy the good weather and watch the hustle and bustle of the Montreal streets.  Who doesn't love to people watch while enjoying a cup of coffee?  The servers were very quick and attentive.  I noticed that when I added creamer to my coffee it began to curdle!  I freaked out a little bit but our server replaced my coffee right away.  Although I was a bit hesitant to drink my beverage the servers came to our table often to refill our drinks and make sure that everything was okay which I liked.  We then decided to order a carrot cake which I posted a photo of.  Nothing too special about it.  The cake almost tasted as if it was an add water and bake boxed mixture!  Don't get me wrong it tasted good, you could taste the cream cheese in its frosting which was my favorite part....i have a sweet tooth but it just tasted like instant boxed cake.  I didn't exactly see the full menu except for the special that was posted on the window which was a duck confit option.  The plated dishes that passed by me looked scrumptious.    Overall, I had a good experience and would probably come again to try their lunch options."}
{"text":"I stopped in here by default when my intended designation was closed.  But it all worked out fine. Service was pleasant and the food was good and reasonably priced (onion soup and frites with mayo). Nice place to grab a bite while shopping or strolling in the area."}
{"text":"We were in the area and needed food badly so we settled for this cafe/bistro. The food is decent and staff is friendly. If I were stuck in that neighborhood again I wouldn't mind grabbing a quick lunch here."}
{"text":"Le Cap Vert is an oldie but goodie.  This has been one of my preferred lunch places for years and I never get tired of it.  It's conveniently close to work and service is usually quick and friendly.  As far as lunch places go it is a little on the expensive side but once in a while it is worth the treat.    The restaurant is a bistro and has a little bit of everything on the menu (sandwiches, pasta, meat dishes, salads, etc).  I'm a big fan of their grilled pitas which come with your choice of fries or salad.  My personal favourite is the smoked duck one which contains smoked duck, aged cheddar and caramelized onions.  The pita is grilled to perfection and the flavours are nicely balanced.  The fries can be a little on the bland side but overall the food is pretty good.  There are also daily lunch specials which can be worth trying.  I always enjoy eating here and would highly recommend coming to Le Cap Vert especially if you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Nous nous y sommes rendues pour le lunch entre collegues. La carte est alléchante ! Croques, salades, pastas etc il y en a pour tous les gouts. Dans l'assiette, c'est bon (meme si la salade d'accompagnement est franchement moyenne). Bon mais pas copieux!  Et pour le prix (16.5 une petite pita au saumon), on attend quand même de ne plus avoir faim en sortant..."}
{"text":"Very cozy and friendly staff. A nice quiet hideaway for lunch from the hustle and bustle of St. Catherine. The food was good, but a tad expensive. I'd still probably go back"}
