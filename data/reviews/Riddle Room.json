{"text":"This was our first time trying an escape/adventure room setting, and it was great! The entire set up, including the large, well-lit cafe with a full wall of board games to play, is on the second floor of the building. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The riddle room (\"Missing Anatomy\") was great fun even though we didn't escape in the allotted 50 minutes. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 star, or a solid B, for the escape game Luci's Room.   Escape rooms are a side business, which means you don't get the same passionate staff as some other places. On the plus side, there's a full game board cafe if you're interested.   The room is small but immersive. Limited technology, done well. Puzzles were intuitive and relatively simple for the most part (we needed help with one that took up most of our time). We may have been more entertained with fewer people (we had five). Also, the theme is a bit problematic, and could easily be rectified to avoid a stigmatized topic without much effort (I'd say more but I don't want to ruin the experience). The photo booth is a neat way to overcome the multi-business aspect."}
{"text":"I love that they don't charge a cover for playing the board games (just have to order food and/or drinks).  The place doesn't feel as cozy as Snakes and Lattes, because it is more brightly lit (but that's better for playing the board games!) and there are tables and chairs instead of couches (which is probably the more sanitary option).   Unlike the other board game places, I really like that they also had booths for people who wanted to play video games (N64).   I haven't tried the escape rooms yet.   The only thing they are missing right now is alcohol.  Not that you need alcohol to have fun, but just FYI."}
{"text":"Out of the many escape room and board game places in Toronto, this is the best. Their policies are fair and their snacks are really good.  Even better, they have a variety of video games they they'll come and plug in for you N64, Wii, Guitar Hero. It's awesome.   I tried one of their escape rooms about a month ago and it was challenging and exciting. Well done."}
{"text":"Had a great time at riddleroom a few nights ago celebrating my cousins birthday. We had a large group about 12 people and they were able to accommodate us easily. We ordered snacks for everyone to share. The Japanese popcorn is addictive. The cookies are soooo good. I ordered a pizza panini for myself and it was so delicious. It was loaded with pizza filing and the spicy mayo that came along with it for dipping was great. To drink I had a Nutella latte. I wish this drink could have came in a mug size because it was so good.  The barista really nailed this drink down. For dinner we went to a near by bar and we actually came back to riddleroom after for escape rooms and video games. Half of my group had an amazing time doing the escaperoom \"static\" and the rest played smash brothers on the WiiU. It was the perfect celebration for my cousin. I am looking forward to coming back again with my other friends."}
{"text":"What a fun cafe right on yonge street to hang out with friends and do something different anytime of the day. This is the only board game cafe I know that doesn't charge cover. There is also a wide selection of games from Catan to Nintendo 64 (Marioooo woot-woot!). The food was great too! I loved their mango smoothie and panini sandwich with fries. My friends also rave about their lattes so I'm definitely coming back to try those soon!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5  I came here with my friends and tried one of the escape rooms. We did Luci's room. The escape room was just all right. There isn't much of a back story and even after we escaped, we still didn't understand what happened to the missing girl. It's still bugging me!   The cafe and board games on the other hand was quite fun. It would have been nicer if the setting was a bit more intimate but with no cover charge, there's not much to complain about. Would definitely come back again to try or other games and just hang out with friends."}
{"text":"So much fun! Can't express the great fun had here. Had a private event and the staff is amazing. The owner Phil was so accommodating to all our needs and there's plenty enough of games and fun to be had!   Ended up trying the \"Framed\" room and was so much fun! Took us a lil longer to figure out, but there's nothing better than feeling accomplishment, ESPECIALLY when u break out of jail!!! Too. Much. Fun!  Anyway, there's plenty to keep ur inner kid occupied and enough to keep the adult in u enjoy life again!   If there was ever anything I wanted to do, was to break outta jail, good thing I got my fix in the Riddle Room!   Thnx Phil and staff! Will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Very fun venue. A great selection of board games without paying the standard $5 fee to play. I had a milkshake and it was delicious. The staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Really cool cafe with various activities. I didn't try the escape rooms or rage rooms, so the rating is only for the cafe. And the coffee and sandwiches are good! But being able to play board games and retro video games at no charge, while sipping a drink at the table is really what makes this place shine. It has a \"geeky\" vibe to it, although the decor could be a little more cosy. I regret that the games aren't sorted by difficulty and number of players, like at Snakes and Lattes, who appears to be more of a specialist if you are looking mainly for the board game experience and like a cozier decor."}
{"text":"Came back to Riddle Room to try a different room with a group of friends.... Honestly we had a blast!  We have been talking about going back every since!   Our goal was to find out what happened to the little girl who went missing from the room.  We found ourselves in a little girls bedroom (creep factor high)... And it was fun and hard!  The staff here are amazing and it's awesome to play card or board games before or after your room time.  Combine with that great food and service and you truly have a perfect storm."}
{"text":"This place is the best! The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The room was a lot of fun and they had a great game selection! XD"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the room escape yet, but it's definitely on my to-do list. This place has great vibes (and coffee!). Everyone is super friendly, and they have a pretty extensive board game selection."}
{"text":"Love the fact that there is no cover charge to play, just purchase of a drink/food item. Get the lavender london fog and the japanese popcorn! great space with friendly servers and a ton of new games with legible instructions. Will be back!"}
{"text":"How could I not love this place? The guys running the place were super laid back & nice. They even shared their tim bits with me & my husby as soon as we came in. We got 2 paninis -- veg & pizza. Both were delightful, served with chips. We played a few boardgames, and sat at a table with mario gaming system. So we played that too! Fun times."}
{"text":"LOVE, love, love \"Riddle Room!\" Went here with a group of 6 friends and it was an absolute pleasure. As a board games junkie, I'm surprised to hear a review say it's not as \"cozy\" as Snakes and Lattes. I find Snakes and Lattes almost overbearing with how crowded it is (and no reservation system,) and how dim the lights can be, and Riddle Room has such a sense of community to it - for once, the people who work there actually care about you and go above and beyond.  BIG shout outs to Phil, who we had as our server and who really went above and beyond with everything. Enthusiastic and considerate, he noticed we wanted to watch the Jays game and went out of his way to make sure that we could stream it there. He also just chatted with us and made us feel extremely welcome, like the Riddle Room is a place to meet new and old friends. Thanks to Phil, we'll definitely be back!!  Food: amazing! Try the Japanese popcorn (tossed in a sweet seaweed mix)- it's such a treat to the tastebuds and for $2 it can't be beat!  Drinks: my boyfriend is a coffee snob, but he and I both adored the drinks we ordered here! Riddle room is KNOWN for its talented barista and its phenomenal latte art (heard they're having a latte art competition coming up, too! How exciting.) bf got the Cortado and I got the lavender earl grey. We were both very impressed- this place has better coffee than some specialty coffee shops down the street.  Board games: cards against humanity, Telestrations, settlers of catan, etc...you'll find the most popular games here and I hope the collection increases. No complaints, though!  Everything else: absolutely spectacular. I love how innovative Riddle Room is with their videogame selections and equipment- they're prepared for everything! Our server even offered us a charger cable for our laptop when it ran out.   Definitely check this place out!  Or don't...because I kind of love not having to wait for hours to get a table at a board games café ;)"}
{"text":"Had an awesome high quality escape room experience. Rooms are well designed and not tacky. The pizza panini served with seasoned chips and Parmesan dipping sauce is addictive. Also loved the latte and variety of board games. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great escape room. highly reccommend"}
{"text":"Came here at 7pm on a Friday evening with friends to play some board games. There wasn't a wait and we were able to get a table right away.  Great selection of board games that were clean and in good condition. Coffees are good and reasonably priced.  It's pretty fantastic that you can play for free with a drink purchase.  Only issue I had was that we asked two different staff how to play a game (Munchkin) and they weren't helpful at all. In fact, they told us it 'wasn't their thing' and that they didn't like the game without offering to find someone to give us the low-down on the rules.   This place got progressively busier through the night and was full by the time we left (around 10pm).  Overall, great spot. Would be 5-stars if they had a couple game gurus to help navigate the rules of a couple less mainstream games."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to hang out with my posse on a slow night. This place has everything: a very good mix of classic board games along with new indie titles. I was surprised that they also have a nice collection of video games to rent for the night as well! Sweet! Possibly the best thing about The Riddle Room besides its cozy atmosphere is the cost. All it takes to get in is to purchase a menu item. The prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend the Reese Latte."}
{"text":"One of my favourite place to spend the night. Many games for you to choose.  Drinks and food are cheap. Love the Japanese popcorn"}
{"text":"Very cool place that has escape rooms, board games, video games, and food - basically everything you need for a great afternoon hang out with friends :) It's also pretty surprising they don't charge any cover to stay there (and you can stay as long as you want!) and you only have to buy something to enjoy everything the cafe has to offer. The room itself was nice and cozy, and there was no line up either (though I expect that to change as more people find out about this place). There was a good variety of board games, but not as much as perhaps the other board cafes I've been to. The service was ordinary - no one was rude, but neither were the staff exceptionally friendly.  The worst thing about my experience was the food - tiny portions, pretty bad taste, just sub-par in general. That being said, I guess I don't really have the right to complain - see comment about no cover ;)"}
{"text":"Must go place with your friends in Toronto! The latte me and my friend got were really pretty and the atmosphere was just really nice."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out. It's a board game cafe, escape room and retro video game \"arcade\" all in one. There's some pretty cool decor with Tetris theme going on. Best of all there is NO COVER!!! You just need to order one thing each minimum. I always feel ripped off at board game cafes that charge cover as I always do order as a courtesy and of course I get hungry and thirsty as we play!!  They have multiple booths set up with tv screens. You can choose to play board games or hook up a game consol. There are multiple game consoles to choose from, you can go old school with N64 or go with more recent titles on an xBox.   They have a good range of board games to choose from. Nowhere near as many as Snakes and Lattes, but all the most popular social games are there with MANY copies so you don't have to worry about hogging games before other tables get there.   Customer service was excellent. The staff seem really chill and friendly all the time and try to make your stay as comfortable as possible.   My friends and I all ordered different drinks. The staff were really good about coming by to check if the people that ordered tea wanted more water. The lattes had super cute latte art. They are very talented here! It's worth it to just come by for the latte itself!"}
{"text":"So this review is for the escape room Framed.  I don't want to give it away so I won't discuss the puzzles in detail.  It was fun and solvable with teamwork.  We did need to ask for clues, but the great part was that the stuff didn't just tell you the answer - they gave you hints and let you figure it out for yourself.  And since there was no one behind after us, we got a bit of extra time which let us escape!  One thing that was disappointing was that when I asked the staff member to give us the back story of the room, she just said there really isn't one and said something along the lines of imagining that we woke up in the cells after a night of drinking.  That actually isn't the case - there is a back story which is evident from reading the files in the room.    After doing the room we hung out in the cafe - I had a strawberry milkshake - yum! - and the japanese popcorn which wasn't for me.  They have a bunch of board games to choose from although some are unfortunately in rough shape.  It was just the two of us so it was harder to find a 2 player game - in retrospect I wish we had allotted more time to the board games as there were some complicated games that looked fun to play but had instruction booklets that for sure would have taken at least 20 minutes to read and figure out.  They also have video games :)  As for the staff - the guy in charge, Jeff (sp?), was a pleasure to deal with, very accommodating and service-oriented.  The rest of the staff was great too with the exception of a female staff member who was very surly and seemed to be unhappy working there.  This is one of few rooms in Toronto that accomodate two people - excellent value for money and clean facilities - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff. Many, big tables. Spacious. Lots of board games and video games to choose from. We didn't do the escape room, just the board games. As long as you order something to eat or drink, you can basically stay there as long as you'd like to play (no hourly or cover charges). There's a variety of options: coffee, lattés, teas, baked chips, paninis, etc.   We've been here multiple times with family and friends and it's always a fun time and a great atmosphere! We can always find a table. Also, there is a small staff of people who work there, and the owner, Philip, is super friendly and nice! It's small enough for patrons to eventually be recognized and greeted as regulars (unlike other huge places like Snakes and Lattés).   I would highly recommend this place to anyone, especially if you're looking for cheap entertainment on week day. It's kid and adult friendly too!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Terrific staff, games, food and beverages. There's no cover to play games for hours on end. You simply have to order food and/or beverages which are all great quality for what you're paying for! You are automatically comfortable in the environment. You can tell it's owned and operated by a group of friends. Even though there are other board game places in my area, this place will always be our go to. The staff go well out of their way to accommodate and remember us even if we only order a few coffees and desserts and stay for 2 hours. I could not recommend this place more!"}
{"text":"After two trips to the Riddle Room, I have to say that this place is really a gem in the area. They have a great selection of games (including multiple copies of the more popular ones) and the staff went out of the way to accommodate every request. The service was absolutely on point.   While the escape the rooms were not as clever and interactive as some of the ones I've been to in NYC and SF, there was a natural progression of clues. One minor improvement that can be made is temperature inside the rooms - without windows or central air, they tend to get pretty toasty when you have a bunch of people in a room together."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have competed all their escape rooms. They are very well done the flow was good and very immersive. I have also gone there just to play some games with my son. Great for family bonding with out having to go buy games in hopes the family will like it.  He tried games that he usually wouldn't play.  The food is good tried the Japanese popcorn and some sandwiches. I will continue to visit and hope they add or change rooms so I can do more (I am somewhat addicted to escape rooms)"}
{"text":"This place is great when you want to do an escape room or just play board games with friends or family. I came here with my friends and we all had a very positive experience.  To play board games, you just have to order a drink and you can stay as long as you want. I ordered the strawberry milkshake and it was not that sweet which was great. They have a great selection of board games and even video games too. The board game area has a great vibe to it to chill.   We played an escape room and I thought it was very fun. They offer unlimited hints if you need them. The room had many things to solve and you have 50 minutes to escape from the room. We failed as a group but we had a lot of fun. I loved the photobooth area where you take a photo with the props. You can send the pictures to either on Facebook, Twitter or your email. Great idea even if you succeed or fail.  I definitely will be back in the future to try their other escape rooms."}
{"text":"The Riddle Room is great however I have never tried the riddle room itself!  Asides from an escape game type of thing this place is a cafe, games lounge and restaurant.   They sell food and an incredible variety of drinks that are surprisingly high quality.  This place is probably better than 80% of the cafes out there.  A major reason why this place is awesome as heck is that there are probably 500 board games to choose from which you can play for free as well as n64 and stuff.  Why not have a sandwich and a latte while playing Mario Party with friends all for about the same price you would pay at Starbucks or any other cafe.  If you are in the area, give it a shot.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun!! Very well thought out rooms and challenges. Interior cafe is beautiful and full of games!! Amazing place to bring your friends to hang out. Lots of fun escape rooms to choose from. One of the best places in Toronto to visit!!"}
{"text":"An enjoyable way to spend a few hours (or more). This place was really busy when I arrived on a Sunday afternoon so clearly very popular. So busy in fact all tables were full but one soon cleared up.   I liked the concept. I haven't come across a place like this before. There are so many board games to choose from. Like literally SO many. And then there are also games consoles you can hook up to a TV and again, there is plenty of choice there too. We went for a few rounds of Mario Kart followed by Guess Who.   Whilst I only had a can of San Pellegrino, the cafe menu looked pretty sweet. All you have to do is buy one item and you're free to stay all day if you like which is a nice touch.   Only complaint - staff could have been more approachable. Our wii remote wasn't working and I asked what was wrong and rather than explain the guy just walked off with the remote and came back with a new one without muttering a single word... found it a bit unfriendly.   Either way, I'd say it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"What started off as a 4 star experience has evolved to a five star. My first experience at Riddle Room was for the escape room. We chose the doctors room as our first room and it was fantastic! It is unique in many different ways. Without giving away too much, I was extremely impressed with RRs dedication in building some of their intricate puzzles. Also unique in that the door you come in from is not necessarily the door you go out through ;) Definitely makes the experience feel a lot more like I'm actually escaping. They also boast a photobooth with props where you can take four pictures which you can email to yourself and post on social media which my friends and I loved. We went on the weekend though so it was slightly pricey. $25 with tax makes it around $28 ($20 for Mon-Thurs). This was largely why I was going to give this place a four stars but upon my 2nd visit I have changed my mind. (Also, you can play boardgames for as long as you want after the esc rooms too so the price can be justified to an extent)   What also surprised me was the size of the venue. They have a separate space for the escape rooms and the board game cafes. A surprisingly large space for a downtown location. They also clearly invested a lot here. At the booths you get a tv screen and you can ask the staff to plug in a variety of consoles ranging from the n64 to the wiiu (they even have the NINTENDO POWER GLOVE). They also have a still expanding selection of board games. Since they are relatively new, all the games are in perfect condition with multiples of the popular games so you don't have to compete with other guests for desired games.  What really won me over were the drinks and the staff. They have paninis and snacks, which were good but nothing exceptional. The drinks though had beautiful latte art that maintained its form as you drink it and did not rely on sweetener and flavouring to be delicious.   Staff were also great. There's no time limit and not once did the staff act like we were overstaying our welcome, nor were we pressured to keep buying things to make up for the time we spent there. They check on us for water, and everyone were extremely friendly and thrilled to help us make the most of our visit.  Definitely will return and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome, good finger foods and drinks at good prices to spend all day there wit ur friends. Its now my go-to spot to chill. I've had some pretty intense nights there playing board games. Their variety of games are huge too, so I never get bored. Their escape rooms are pretty cool too. definitely gonna eventually all the different rooms. Plus it doesnt hurt that theres some pretty cute girls hanging out there often. everybody should definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! There's a great board game cafe in the front with food, snacks + coffee (the cappuccinos and matcha latte are delicious and super cute).  The tables are actually real doors that they customized, there's a giant jenga in the corner with a cute tetris wall behind it and tetris lights.  And of course, there are lots of fun games on the huge game wall (the people are super nice and can help you pick).  My friend and I did Luci's room and it was creepy but so much fun.  They will give you a hint if you get stuck! Extra plus, the bathrooms are nerdy and fantastic."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the staff here is the bomb! From the moment you walk up the stairs, Vaughn (not John!) and team take care of you. They welcomed us in, explained the set up of the space, and got us up and running on Mario Kart on Nintedo 64! So damn nostalgic!   They've got four rooms you can pick from and I had the (mis)fortune of going into Static. That is one tough room or so I'm going to keep telling myself so I can sleep at night. Seriously speaking, they did a really great job with this room. It'll really make you think.   After completing the room, we just chilled in the main area with some food, drink and board games. I had the bacon & cheese panini with the strawberry mint smoothie. The smoothie is delicious and refreshing. Don't even think twice about it, order it now!  The butter tart is divine - especially warmed up with ice cream on top. Yummmmm. They get their cookies from Red Bench located just up the street so you can't go wrong there.   They have a big variety of board games to choose from, which hasn't always been the case with the last two escape rooms I've been to. You can also chill and play some video games.   Thank you for the wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"My favourite spot to hang with friends! If you're ever bored with someone and around the downtown area, this is the place to come!! The best time to come here would be around 3-5 o'clock on a weekday- i've noticed those are when it's least busy. They have an array of board games, video games, and escape rooms (that I have yet to try). The best part is all you have to do is buy some food (no limit) and you can play as long as you want! The sandwiches are pretty good and it comes with a side of potato chips. This location is also conveniently right next to a subway station. I am there almost every week and I love it every time ! :)"}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere, never been pressured to give up table/game. Smoothies are great. Tried two escape rooms - had a ton of fun, but can't give a critical review as I've only been to a few escape rooms. I can say if you're a newb like me, you'll probably have a good time with Luci's room (unless u get frustrated easily).  Gotta give a shout-out to the superb customer service - must have gotten a little excited in one of the escape rooms because I left my keys inside! Called them in the morning, and even though they were closed someone answered and stayed later then they were planning to allow me to pick up my keys. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've tried two escape rooms here and both have been amazing, haven't tried any of the food but the board game cafe is fun with tons of different games. The guitar hero is a big plus because who doesn't love guitar hero? I'd definitely recommend these escape rooms, they really get you to think but it's so much fun!"}
{"text":"This place is really fun to unwind after work. Good weekday price for escape and board game play. Lots of variety in terms of board games. We tried Anatomy escape room which was pretty awesome and scary. Although we kept buzzing the management for a clue and they forgot that we were in the room lol"}
{"text":"Extensive library of board games, card games, and other types of table-top games.  The collection is also constantly growing with new arrivals almost everytime I go. They had a can of pogs yesterday, though I've never figured out what those were about.  Game consoles are available, including retro consoles like SNES and N64. I usually see a lot of mario: mario kart, mario party, super mario world, smash bros, etc. There's also a Kinect that you can use. Just ask the staff to help set things up.  Lots of food and drink options available. Tea, milkshakes, coffee, unusual canned soft drinks, flavored chips/popcorn, cake, panini's, to name a few.  They have 5 escape rooms right now. Prices are comparable to other places. Tried one so far, and it was a good experience. The room itself wasn't too big, but it had a nice story with a lot of puzzles that require you to find the clues and use them to proceed to the next step. Want to try the Castle that recently opened.  On top of escape rooms, they also have a rage room. Feeling angry after losing? Grab a bat and break stuff. Lots of options from small objects to large objects including electronics, and apparently an indestructible block.  A great place for groups, with a lot of different types of activities to choose from."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this place but there's so much room for improvements. You don't have to pay a cover to get in, you just have to buy something to eat or drink and you're allowed to play any of the games they have for as long as you want (Video games or board games). That's the cool part.  They have about 6 tables with screens where they connect the console that you want to use and you play freely. They also have about 8 tables for you to play just board games.  So this is like Snakes and Lattes.. but you don't have to pay a cover to play AND you can play video games.  Now.. The food they have is terrible. I had a panini and tried the vanilla cake. I didn't have food that bad in a loooong time.   Games, tables and chairs are not clean. They are greasy and smelly. It's obvious that they don't clean the controls or consoles at all. People go there, drink, eat and touch those controllers with dirty hands and they don't clean them? Wow! The only okay thing was the nutella decaf coffee. And I ordered it because they didn't have ice-cream for the milkshakes.   The selection of games is not very large. And again, they are not clean.  Customer service wasn't anything special.  I didn't see alcohol anywhere, so I guessed they don't serve any alcoholic drink.  They have one of each consoles (1 PlayStation, 1 Xbox, 1 Wii, Etc) and a small variety of games for each of them. When I was there, the place was pretty empty and almost all the consoles were in use. Please buy 2 of each consoles minimum if you're going to offer them as a service for people to use.  I don't think I would go back to this place. It's probably good for teenagers, but not for adults."}
{"text":"This is only for the cafe, not the escape rooms. That will be left for another day.   Alright, I must say, that the Cafe section of the Riddle Room is definitely a welcome surprise. It is a well-lit, open room with tables in the middle and booths aligning the walls.   The collection is small compared to behemoths like Snakes & Lattes, of which I will be referring to since I assume if you are reading this, then chances are that you have already visited S&L.   Any who, I digress, the repertoire of games at the RR is definitely nothing to sneeze at, plus, at least the games we decided to pick where in really good shape, or at least in better shape than the same ones at S&L.   It is quite hidden, on the second floor of a building next to a condo construction site... it being downtown it figures that a condo would be being built next to it.   When I was there on a Saturday the place was fairly empty, which is good but due to its open concept, I can imagine the locale could get fairly loud with a full house. So keep that in mind when coming here. It is definitely better to come with a large group of friends so you can be all loud and silly rather than whispering your way through, since once there is a lot of people, having a conversation without having to raise your voice will be next to impossible.   The fact they have group video games is also a plus as it definitely adds another dimension to the locale that would have otherwise been nothing more than a baby version of Snakes and Lattes. Down to the tint of the wood on the floor.   This place is very central and being less than a 1-2 minute walk from a subway station also greatly increases its accessibility. I am a fan of this.    The fact they do not immediately slap an 18% gratuity to your bill, regardless if you are a group, plus the fact there is no extra charge for playing the games outside the purchasing of a drink is definitely worth highlighting. Since it is a bit annoying that it costs about $13 in total to have one(1) coffee, plus the $6 to play, plus an 18% gratuity (+tax) every time we went to Snakes and Lattes. Specially if you are not looking for some specific or overly specialized games. Trust me, it adds up over time.   Perhaps S&L could command such prices when they were the only ones in town but game rooms are starting to pop up and S&L will lose business over time unless they tweak those prices.   The drip coffee at RR is overpriced, but everything else is in line with a regular cafe. Therefore, I can honestly say the Riddle Room is fast becoming my new board game go-to place. I would say that you should do exactly the same, but then again, that just means more people will be showing up if you believe me. Mmm... So let's play a game, and pretend you did not read this review. Yes...just remember... the Riddle Room is TERRIBLE...   ;-)  *cough* *cough*    The RR is not the most intimate of places but definitely one that is a lot of fun for +4 groups. Lastly, like most game rooms they do not take reservations so make sure you come early in order to secure your table.   Drop by, play some games. Chances are, you will enjoy the Riddle Room."}
{"text":"So much love for this place.  This is my second time coming here and it was just as great as my first time. Wonderful and friendly staff, BEAUTIFUL interior decor for the holidays, clean and well lit, well-stocked with games, and is overall a great place to hangout with friends.  My friends and I played the Static escape room and it was definitely a challenge! We didn't finish in time (50mins) but because we were the last group to go, we were allowed to stay and finish our escape, which was pretty awesome!  Again, I have/will continue to recommend friends to come here!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  My friend wanted to go to escape room so bad and I wanted to go to a board game place. We ended up getting what we wanted :) I feel like I'm going to be a regular [depends if my friends drive] cause I'm from the east side.  There was 5 of us when we came in as a walk in around 7:30 on a Saturday. The place isn't too busy - the place is spacious enough.  Activities:  - SO MUCH OPTIONS! It is an escape room/ board game cafe. There were lots of options in terms of board games although there could be more. As for the escape rooms, I believe there were 4 options available and they are working on another one.  - The staff recommended Sherif and we had no idea how to play it. We read the manuals and enjoyed the game!! - Luci's Room [$25 WEEKEND]: VERY CREEPY. Wasn't expecting \"the surprise\". We had 50 mins. to complete it but failed to do so. They gave us extra time since there was no other booking left. I must say, for a rating of 2 star difficulty - it kinda threw us off and the puzzles were pretty clever.  - free PHOTOBOOTH [unlimited pictures] at the end and also you can write on their wall and make your mark!  Food:  - Their food is really good [beef panini + japanese popcorn $6 + taxes] along with the sauce that comes with it. I also ordered the cookies n cream milkshake and it was delicious. I'm easy to please with food :)  Staff: - Super friendly and helpful. They made us feel welcomed and offered help whenever we needed it. A guy actually explained an entire game to us. Another staff had to reset their router b/c their WiFi isn't working. Some places do not take the extra step to at least satisfy their customers.  - fun people and easy to talk to  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND! A MUST TRY. MY FAVOURITE PLACE SO FAR!"}
{"text":"Riddle Room is a (board)gamer's haven.   Rules: One drink per person and you can stay as long as you'd like without any cover/additional fees.   Really?? Riddle Room's drinks are quite delicious, so you'll likely want to order more anyway, but you can't beat that.   This place has a huge collection of board games and video games. They also offer a few escape the room venues as well."}
{"text":"This place has great coffee and is a fun escape room. Puzzles were set up well and it's a cool place to hang. The waiting area is a full  coffee shop with retro games and things to do so you can go even if you aren't doing an escape room. Had a really great time."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My girlfriend and I were in Toronto for vacation and decided to check it out.  We never did an escape room before, but after trying one at Riddle Room, we ended up spending pretty much the rest of our vacation there.  We did all four rooms- Lucy's Room and Missing Anatomy were definitely our favorites.  Amazing theme/aesthetics that really makes you feel immersed in the story.  Also great use of technology (not to give anything away)- we had a lot of 'wow' moments in the rooms.  Other than the escape rooms themselves, Riddle Room has tons of board games and video games that you can play while you wait for your escape room time (or just come to play board  games anyway).  I also can't say enough good things about the employees themselves, who are all incredibly nice guys (and girl).    Go to Riddle Room!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yay for no cover! All you have to do is order drinks or food off the menu to stay in the board game Cafe. I highly recommend their super cute lattes and Japanese popcorn! I like how they have a larger selection of teas compared to other board game cafes I've been too. Their prices for food and drinks are also more affordable. What makes this cafe different is that it has escape rooms AND video games!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! The staff here are so friendly, and the food here is also really good.   I definitely recommend the mango basil smoothie and the peanut butter matcha man cookie. The smoothie had the perfect amount of basil flavour. And the matcha added a great touch to the cookie.  I also really liked the hot chocolate because it wasn't overly sweet. I tried a roast beef vegetable panini, and it was good, but I felt it could've used more roast beef!   Popcorn snack was nice balance of sweet and salty. The chips didn't stand out to me much.  Onto the board games and escape rooms: sizeable selection of board games, and fantastic playing environment (quite spacious interior). I did the Static escape room. It's apparently the hardest one they had. I found the puzzles to be well done, and it looked like they put a lot of effort into decorating the rooms.  Would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I've been several board game cafes but I would say this is my favourite of them all. It's tucked away on the second floor of Yonge Street a few minutes walk from Wellesley subway station and the store is stacked with an excellent selection of board games, video games and escape rooms. The board game cafe is clean, spacious and well-lit. The escape rooms are well thought out and well executed. Escape rooms are a bit pricy, but an escape room is a fun group bonding experience that you should try (at least once) - I've done the doctor anatomy escape room and it was one of the best ones I've done. I'll have to try more in the future. It is a great place to be with a large group of friends as the cafe is spacious. In addition to this, their staff and menu are awesome - their lattes are delicious; I'd recommend the matcha or nutella! There's free WiFi too. Definitely a gem in the city!"}
{"text":"I went for the \"Missing Anatomy\" escape room. We escaped with about 18 min and 42 secs left on the clock. The room was very well-decorated and it was a lot of fun, but I felt like it was a bit short. I would've enjoyed a third room in addition to the two rooms we had to escape from.   The staff were not very helpful. When we escaped, nobody seemed to take notice. We waited around to take our \"victory pictures\" but the staff were nowhere to be found. When we finally found the cashier at the cafe part, she kept on telling us that someone was \"coming\", but we just needed someone to take a picture for us, she could've easily done it herself...."}
{"text":"I came where while walking along younge street with some friends looking for a café with games. The vibe of the café felt welcoming the second I stepped in. The place and staff are amazing, they were extremely pleasant and welcoming, specifically explained how the café works.  All you have to do is purchase a drink or food and you can stay as long as you want with a large variety of board games, escape rooms, and other activities. I suggest the Japanese popcorn, which is basically sweet popcorn with shreds of seaweed and maybe caramel. This place is amazing and definitely will come back with friends and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I had a good time here on a Sunday afternoon with friends. The drinks were good, decor nice, and food yummy. However, I did notice some things that could be improved.   First of all, having a server come to take your order, personally would lead to a much better experience. My group had to continually get up multiple times (harder when you're in a booth) to walk up, stand in a line, order, pay and then sit back down. If we could all order at the table so we could spend more time playing than walking back and forth, and pay at the end (instead of paying like 3 times in a visit) that would be so much more convenient.  Also, when I went the latté artist was not there, super disappointed as the main reason I chose this place as opposed to other board game cafes were for its cute latté designs!! The hot drinks were kind of slow to come out, in my group of 5 there was a 15 minute time difference between when the first arrived and the last.  Overall, the place is cute and I could see myself coming back, but things like not enough food options, having to walk up to order, slow service, and no latté artist being there made my experience more average than something to write home about."}
{"text":"Riddle Room is easily my favourite board game cafe in Toronto. They have a wall full of board games and the staff there are really engaging and teach you through them. It's relatively cheap as they only require you to purchase a drink and you can stay however long you like. They also have video console games!  I've tried one of their escape rooms before, and the experience was definitely worth the price I paid.  I believe there are 5 in total and I will have to come back and try them all."}
{"text":"I did my first ever escape room! I went with a large group and unfortunately we had to split up into two smaller groups for the rooms (there was 8 of us to begin with). Some of my friends had recently visited the Riddle Room and were already in love with the place. I can totally see why.  It's $20/person to do a room on a weekday, $25 on the weekends. That is a bit pricey, however, when compared to other escape room prices, more affordable. I did the room called Framed. The staff can be contacted by walkie, and while they won't tell you how to solve your problem, they will try to direct you so you can solve it yourself.  At the end, we got to take group pics with the props they have.  We didn't play any board games, however, I do know that there isn't a cover/fee for playing the games. You simply need to order something from the cafe (and the prices are very reasonable) and enjoy the games with your friends!  Will definitely be coming back to do more escape rooms, but also to enjoy some of their games; the location is super convenient for me!"}
{"text":"Cool and fun escape rooms! Much better than others I've been to. Also has a cute cafe and game room with lots of board games. All you have to do is buy a drink and you can stay and play games as long as you want. Great place to meet up with friends and hang out. Friendly staff also helps make the experience even better!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto a few weeks back and we tried this location based off of our local friend's recommendation. It was a very cool environment. Their game cafe was warm and inviting and I had a lot of fun playing games as well as seeing everyone have a good time. We had just been introduced to the idea of escape rooms or riddle rooms so it was neat seeing what they had to offer. Our room was super cool with many twists and turns I wasn't expecting. Staff were very nice and friendly and I had a great time there."}
{"text":"Really awesome place. Stay as long as you want when you buy something. Great friendly staff who are also making board games of their own! Talk to Tommy Xiao and try his new game - we had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Here a few times for boardgames (duh)  It's a very casual place. They want you to order one drink min but I haven't seen them checking up on ppl. Nonetheless I like their drink and food menu. The coffee is pretty good. They also come up with occasional twists to it like lavender or Nutella flavoured latte. They also make good panini   The boardgame selections are not as huge as other places but it's enough. They also have an escape room but we never tried it.   Will definitely come with friends over and over again."}
{"text":"My friend who is Deaf and doesn't communicate well in English went to reserve a table for us. Both the manager and the owner lacked courtesy and decided to kick her out of the place when she wanted to order an item. When we all arrived, it was already too late. The miscommunication between my friend and them lead them to make us lose our table. I told them I had no issue paying for everything as I always do. They did not politely offer a new table and ended up discriminating us as a group. They did not believe that I was telling the truth. (Since I too do not hear well, they decided that we all fall into the same bucket) The worst part? We were coming as a group for a friend's birthday and that person felt quite depressed when he was rejected by the staffs for something he did not do. In brief, this place does not respect diversity and discriminates people who cannot hear."}
{"text":"A great place to go with friends. Riddle Room encompasses great escape rooms, with a quality board game (and electronic game) selection and great cafe food. Out of all the escape places I have been to, this one is the ONLY one I have been to that has everything and is done well.  ESCAPE ROOM When I look for a good escape place, I need to see good staging, non-obvious puzzles and ambiance. The construction of the rooms is very good. I've seen a lot of chop shop room builds and this one was well finished. Maybe even to code (ignoring fake fixures in the rooms though). The props were thoughtful and worked within the design of the space. Thought was put into misleading participants slightly. Puzzles incorporated multiple aspects of the room, and it wasn't like there was ONE puzzle per room that was like... \"solve the soduko on this box and here is the key to this other box that has a clearly marked puzzle\".... you have to work for it and that's what makes it thrilling!   FOOD My party tried an array of paninis, lattes and smoothies/milkshakes. Everything we had was good. Milkshakes were rich in taste and tasted real. Paninis were made on sliced bread and had good flavour combinations. Also comes with chips and a light mayo dip. Latte art is definitely a highlight. I had a cute piggy on mine. I saw another girl who had a Totoro on hers. The quality art definitely adds to the latte experience. ;)  BOARD GAMES Good selection of popular and niche games, all in great condition. The Settlers of Catan game we played was actually *new* still with pieces in plastic bags. We actually had to ask if we could play it because we weren't sure if a game that was meant to be sold got mixed in with the rest. For the record, it doesn't appear that any of RR's games are up for sale. (But I didn't ask)  BONUS They have a photo booth right before you leave the escape room area where you can take pictures with your team. Photos can be shared on social media or emailed to you directly from the ipad. And you can tag the walls! So fun."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a lot of board game joints yet, but I have a feeling I won't: Riddle Room is just perfect!  First of all, they have a HUGE selection of games, both video and board ones. Everything from silly games like Spot It, CAH, Exploding Kittens, to more \"serious\" stuff like Agricola, Catan etc. so there's something for every taste, really. And they also have lots of retro gaming (lots of fun playing Mario Party 64!), so that's cool too!  I tried the Pizza Panini and it was pretty good, with a side of paprika flavored chips and dipping sauce. Also it was just 6$ which is a steal!  My friends got a matcha cappuccino and oh my god they have a great cappuccino artist! He drew a cool drawing on it, super nice!"}
{"text":"We came here when this place first newly opened since it is owned by my good friend's family. A group of 8 of us are all eager to try anything and wanted to finally try these new \"escape\" type of rooms together. This is anything BUT those ghetto escape rooms that is just 4-walls and combo locks ... THIS has some HIGH Tech stuff here.   Atmosphere: Firstly, let's just say that i was a little surprised how big this place was. First when we entered, it looked like such a small little stairwell -- but I didn't expect that we would enter such a large \"lounge\" type area. It had the full counter for ordering food and paying for the escape room. it really just looked like a board game lounge.  This place is a combo of BOARD games and ESCAPE rooms.  Very clean place and large area to play board games while the escape room was separated in another section where the employees have to walk you to the entrance of each room.   Games : We didn't stick around to play board games after our escape rooms. So this review will be based on the escape room that my friends and I participated in. it was the \"easy room\" Doll house or something. Little did we expect it to have so many electrical / high tech things in the room. It was suspenseful and tough to solve and sadly we had to keep asking for clues. We were just not good as escape room things and plus , i think we were freaking ourselves out in the room. Normally, I'm not usually scared of things, but I was in the room with my fellow girlfriends who influenced me to be a little more scared!  Food: As we sat down to wait for our 2 rooms to be ready (group of 8 and we split up to have one scarier room and one normal room --- LUCKY we got the scary one), we were served with the japanese popcorn!! It was delicious -- It was sweet and salty like kettlecooked popcorn and topped with those sesame and seaweed. (Sorry, I later  tried this at home with a bag of kettle cooked popcorn and bought rice seasoning and made this to eat as well!! SO YUMMYS).   HAVE FUN!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Wednesday night at around 9:30PM. The location wasn't too difficult to find but the entrance leads to a set of stairs that you have to go up so the location did not appear to be wheelchair accessible -as far as I know.   Once we entered I noticed that there was around 6 or 8 booths lining the walls with a TV mounted on each while the middle had smaller tables. The booths can fit 6 people comfortably and there were areas to play more elaborate games that take up more space, such as Rock band/guitar hero in the corners - though that area was restricted during our stay.  I was told that you just had to purchase something from the menu to play games but the staff member told us that we can get situated before we came up to order. The place was fairly busy when we got there, almost all the booths were occupied and the middle section had some some customers seated as well. They have a binder beside the bookshelf next to the enterance with all the game stations and games offered which I thought was very helpful. Additionally, there were plenty of board games and even multiples of some (such as Avalon, resistance, and one night werewolf) in the shelves.   The board games you can grab off the shelf, as for the game stations you have to let the staff know after you have decided on what you want. Xbox 360, PS3 and the Wii are just some of the stations offered here, they have more stations - some old ones like the Nintendo 64 as well. If you are unfamiliar with setting up the stations, the staff will be able to help you out, as they offered when I picked out the Wii (later got rekt in game by my friend).   I got the Matcha Latte (~$6), which came with some classic latte art. The matcha flavour was prominent and the bitterness was to my liking, would order again. My friend got a green tea ($3, I don't remember the exact name), which was just your typical green tea BUT they did say if more hot water was needed- just ask and they'll provide which was a nice touch. There was a good selection of teas to choose from. The kitchen/cafe closed approximately an hour before the location closes so I'd suggest getting here before 11pm but that's not such a hard requirement to meet.   Overall it was a positive experience and I would definitely drop by again!  This review is NOT based on the escape rooms that's offered here.   Tip: if you see a game station in a booth unattended and you want to use it, let the staff know first instead of grabbing it yourself!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot to hang out with friends and learn a new game, or go old school to relive your favorite childhood games. Had a great time here and the food was great to munch on. Pizza panini was bomb...!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Always come here on weekends with my friends for fun games like Coup, Avalon, Splendor, Sabator, Cash&Guns and many more. Lots of variety of Food and Drinks like paninis, snacks, espressos, lattes, hot and cold drinks. Free to play as long you buy something from them. They also have Escape Room and the new Rage room."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've been here before for their escape rooms and board games + food. (We escaped!)   Glad to come back to try another escape room and hang out with friends. Escape room was $25 a person since we did it on the weekend, after the escape room we decided to wait for a table. This is where the negatives I have about this place comes in, there should be a waiting list set up because I understand there is no time limit to stay and play. HOWEVER, there is no way to distinguish who was waiting first for a table. For fairness there either should be more little chairs/tables OR a waiting list and some little chairs set up for those that are waiting. Instead of us hovering and walking to people who looked like they were leaving but actually just getting more food.   Also, there was the owner? (he did work there that was for sure) I assume, was in a booth that had just his laptop and a plate of cookies. He was out of the booth most of the time too, left his stuff there. Not to be rude, but if you see there are customers standing around waiting for a long time it would be considerate to give up the booth which is able to seat 4 people plus extra chairs too (paying customers because you can't play for free). There were chairs and little tables and the counter he could have used. But like I said it wasn't to offend it was just something we noticed. We waited for over 30 mins and others came in to wait too and they left. That was a bit of a turn off.  There can be some rowdiness as the night goes on, some people were drunk playing board games were really into it and LOUD.  The food here is good, I love their snacks and lattes/drinks. Definitely my top spot for favourite places to hang out. I really like the staff here though, their super nice and courteous. Can get pricey as escape rooms for each person is $20 for weekdays and $25 for weekends along with drinks/food. I don't suggest coming here on an empty stomach (eat dinner ahead of time) unless you have a table ready."}
{"text":"Been there a few times and keep on returning with different groups of friends. The best part is that there is no cover charge for playing games.  All they ask is to make a food or drink purchase at the cafe during the time you stay.   The food and drinks are actually great and reasonably priced. Other cafes charge a cover by hour on weekends and a flat rate on weekdays. Why not spend your money here on food and drinks if you are going to order at the other places.  They have a wide variety of board games including retro video games. If you wanna go to an escape room place, the place also has 4 rooms to choose from. One stop shop downtown with everything you can ask for. Just get there early for the board games since they only stay reservations for the escape rooms."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this board games café located in downtown Toronto near Wellesley station. It's usually quite busy and they have limited seating here. This place is great because you can play board games, retro video games and do an escape room! How cool is that. My friends and I came here to do the High Castle escape room. You have to pre-book and reserve ahead of time to ensure there is availability but its not mandatory. It was about $25 per person for the escape room which is on par with other escape rooms in Toronto. The staff member did a great job explaining the goal of the mission of our escape. 5 stars- great escape room. It wasn't too hard but I think our group was just overthinking throughout the entire mission. We did escape but only after the time expired. At the end of the escape room, there is a photobooth area where you can take pictures and a get copy of it. Overall, it was a great experience. I definitely need to come back here to play the boardgames and retro video games!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends, lots of tables and decent board game selection that rivals the Snakes and Lattes a few blocks down.  The food is great and reasonably priced, I would suggest trying the cakes! However, the escape rooms aspect can use a little work. We went the the static room and didn't quite have a clue with what to do. The challenge lacks logical flow. There are unlimited hints, and I would suggest using as many as you can! Also, when calling for hints the staff was not very responsive and came a while after. All in all, good place for board games and having fun with a large group of people."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I came here last Friday night and it was surprisingly not too packed. They have a good selection of boardgames (not as extensive as snakes and lattes but the essential ones were there). The seating is on a first come first serve basis (they can accommodate about 10-20 groups depending on group size) and they have an unlimited seating time.   There is no entry fee/fee per hour, the only requirement is for one(many?) people to buy something from their cafe, which is not overpriced and also very tasty. My favorite items off the menu were the japanese popcorn (mix of seaweed, wasabi and caramel) and the matcha latte.   I wished they'd stay open a bit later on weekends (they close at midnight)."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Lucy escape room. A plus about this location is that it is also a board game cafe."}
{"text":"Amazing game board cafe! I love coming here with friends and getting one of their lattes because the latte is always so cute. I'm almost a bit sad when I don't get an extravagant latte art design but the latte is delicious nonetheless. Very clean and large space. Super chill place to hang out with tons of board games and even an escape room and photo booth. They also have a basket of blankets if you get cold which I find really cute."}
{"text":"Despite it being pretty packed when we got here, the staff were able to accomodate us. The fee for using their facilities is awesome (buy something, ANYTHING, off of their menu). We sat at a booth where people played guitar hero behind us. The noise levels were bearable, I really thought it'd be worse. The food/drink selection was larger and better than I had anticipated (ranging from cold to hot drinks and meals to desserts). Their wall of board games is just as impressive; they had many of the games we wanted to play, and in good condition. However, some cards from the deck that we got (\"cards against humanity\") were mixed up... unfortunately (with cards from \"crabs against humidity\")."}
{"text":"Good variety of games but still consider this place one with limited number of essentials. We tried the Japanese popcorn. Despite the yummy taste for $2.50 i would have expected something a little bigger."}
{"text":"I went here my with my friends and we had a ton of fun! We only experience the board game cafe, but we're going to go back tonight to try the Escape Room.  The cafe is first come first serve, and the only requirement is that each person in the ground buy at least one thing from the menu. Everything is reasonably priced and there is no hourly charge to stay there.  I recommend the Japanese Popcorn (light wasabi and something to make it a bit sweet) and the cookies and cream milkshake.  There is a massive selection of games to try from, spanning an entire wall. There are also video games available to play! I had a ton of fun, I can't wait to go back and try their escape rooms."}
{"text":"Came here to do an escape room - we did the Missing Anatomy room and it was very average. Firstly, there is no back story or introduction to the room, we were just dropped off directly in the room and left alone. The quality of the props is quite poor. The complexity of the puzzles was lacking, which is also evidenced by the fact that most groups escape in very little time (~30-40 minutes). I've done about 10 escape rooms now and I would not go back to this one. Even the props in the photo booth were very poor quality!   As for the board games and food - I cannot really comment because we did not stay, but I will agree with other Yelp members that the staff are generally friendly and the menu looked good. I do like the fact that you only need to buy a drink to stay (much cheaper than, say, Castle board games on Spadina which has an hourly fee). The board game room on a Saturday was PACKED and extremely loud. People were playing VIDEO GAMES in the midst of it all and the lights are glaringly bright and I felt like all my senses were overloaded in the few minutes I had to wait there for my escape room to start."}
{"text":"I went back and tried 2 of their escape rooms. They are AMAZING. So well crafted and thought out!!! This is literally the only place you need to visit in downtown Toronto when you are with friends. You can play board games, video games, get amazing coffee/teas/cake that puts Starbucks to shame and do quality escape rooms. And the owner is a really awesome and nice guy. Same with the staff. What are you waiting for? GO!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After having gone here for a Yelp event last year I was thoroughly impressed and decided to come back with my friends.  Located quite conveniently on Yonge/Wellesley area it's easily accessible by TTC.  It's on the 2nd floor so you will need to climb some stairs.    There is no cover charge to come here which is amazing.  You can book the rooms online and while you are waiting or after you finish trying to escape the rooms you can play their board games and/or video games in their lounge area.  There is also a small cafe where you can get coffees/teas/shakes as well as cakes/pastries and Japanese popcorn (addicting!).  The best part is - the cafe prices are cheap!  Love it!  I had the mango basil smoothie and the japanese popcorn.  Nice snack while playing games.  They have a wide variety of board games - everything from your standard Jenga, Scrabble, Cards of Humanity to a lot of obscure games i never heard of (Exploding Kittens anyone?).  For $25 on the weekend (per person to do one of the escape rooms) this is a great deal!  I believe there are currently 4 different rooms you can try at varying degrees of difficulty.  I believe they are adding one or two new ones soon.    All the staff are super friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be back.  Riddle me this...riddle me that  :)  And yes - my group escaped the room!  My other group of friends did not escape their room...but hey we can't all be winners (I'm just glad I was!)  LOL"}
{"text":"The Riddle Room has everything you've ever wanted. From escape rooms to a delicious latte. They also have a wide selection of video games and board games. My friends and I love coming here and can easily spend a whole day playing all the games they have!   Escape rooms: I did two of them and I must say... they're a challenge! The rooms are very very creative and designed well. Highly recommended!   Food: I love cheesecake and this place has the best cheesecake everrr. The pieces are big so it's great for sharing! Oh and their latte art is adorable!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel like I spend way too much time here but its only because Riddle room is such a great place to be with friends. I always find a new board game to play each time I go and the staff are always there to teach the rules and get the game going. One of my favorite parts of the cafe is their great selection of video games from old school N64 to the newest Wii consoles...you'll always find people having a Super Smash brawl going on or racing along Rainbow Road! They definitely offer things that other board game cafes in Toronto don't have!   The escape rooms are also the best I've been to in town. Everything is so well set up and challenging that you really get to experience the fun of escape rooms. I've already played 3 of the 4 rooms at RR and managed to get 3rd best time for their Anatomy Room with my friends! Great memories made in each of the rooms.   Food wise...definitely try their pizza panini! My other favorites: Mango Basil Smoothie, Nutella Latte, Lavender London Fog! Coffee addicts will not be disappointed by their drinks. Also give the popcorn and chips a try! The cake is bomb too! Basically...I've tried and loved most of their menu!   If you're looking for a place to bring friends, RR is the place to be! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Had such a fun time this weekend with a few friends to celebrate a birthday. We played the Castle escape room, and it was a great experience. The online reservation booking was easy, the customer service so was friendly and cheerful when we arrived, we asked for hints twice (and the staff came quickly), and the escape room itself was great fun. It was challenging but exciting, and thankfully there wasn't a group right behind us so we went a few minutes over the 50 minutes, but solved it!   Overall it was a fun experience, at such a great central location, and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This was my favorite thing we did in Toronto. I have a preteen, an older teen, and my husband and I. We had so much fun working together to solve the room! It was just the right level of hard and we finished just over the allotted time! The guys running the cafe were so nice! And we wished we had time to play some games. Definitely worth the visit!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. There is no cover charge to sit and play the games, which is a PLUS compared to Snakes and Lattes.  Another plus - no waiting, we sat down immediately. They have an extensive selection of board games and gaming consoles. Including Super Nintendo, N64, Wii. You could easily spend 2 hours here without noticing the time flying by... Great place for new friends.  The food and drinks were ok. I ordered a sandwich and chips because I was very hungry. I will come back and try other things, because everything on their cafe menu is decently priced (all under $7)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Knowledgable about the games, and very helpful.  I like that the space is big and bright. It doesn't have that dark and cramped like other game rooms I've been to.    They have a really big selection of games, including retro video games.    There are 4 escape rooms and they are working on another.  Lots of fun!  The have small snacks, desserts and Paninis.  All of which are tasty.  I've had the popcorn, chips, bacon and cheese panini and both of the smoothies.  Would be nice if they had a liquor license, but not necessary."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Awesome people running the place.   - booking: online reservation was simple and easy.   - staff: was the nicest people I ever met   - escape game: loved it! Happy that the escape room wasn't dark!!   - board game: awesome   All I remember is that it was so much fun"}
{"text":"My favorite place for boardgames. They have a good selection of boardgames and video games you can play with, and the best part there is no cover to sit and play. But a drink and / or a food item and you can play for as long as you want. They have have riddle rooms but I am not really into it and haven't tried it."}
{"text":"I come here every Saturday. Riddleroom has great atmosphere: bright, colourful and engaging. Although the games are pretty worn out and some of them have missing pieces."}
{"text":"Best place to hang out with friends.  They got lots of board games, video games and yummy snacks & drinks.  This is our go to place when my friends and I want to go have some fun.  Its usually pack but we always are able to find some seats.  Service is friendly and helpful with any issues you may have.  Seems like every month they have some new feature added to the store whether its new games or new food items."}
{"text":"Love it for the escape room but service and manners are just not up to par at all ! Yes it's a casual area to hang out but aren't we running a business here ? Couldn't even get a proper receipt for 125 dollar bill ! Manager was rude and impolite , other employees are all over the place completely unorganized . We waited 30min just to have someone get us into the escape room when they told us it's empty and ready ! I don't get that logic , don't tell us we can go in anytime and make us wait ! In another side note we brought out a little snack from \"outside\" after ordering drinks here and not knowing we were told to get out if we continued eating outside food ; we just ordered lattes and coffee and you tell us to get out for bringing in outside food ?? Is someone having a bad day ? We just spent over 150 dollars and you tell confused customers that we need to get out for brining I'm a little snack. Yes I understand there are policies in place but THERE IS A WAY TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES IN PROFESSIONAL MANNER . (P.s coffees are overpriced and tasteless , lattes are good ) Wish there some form of professional business training here , cool place otherwise ."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place to hangout and chill at. Plenty of board/card games to choose from and a selection of drinks that won't break the bank! The environment was lively, clean and organized .  While my friends and I were trying to decide what game to play, an employee came up to our table and recommended a game for us.. I forget the name but it was similar to Cards against humanity where you have to guess what answer the card holder chose.. BUT ANYWAY overall a very pleasant experience, can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"My favourite board game room!!! Staff are super friendly. Don't need to pay per hour fee, just pay for food and drink and stay as long as you like! Drinks are quite delicious!"}
{"text":"2nd time back at the Riddle Room and would come back again!  We brought guests from the UK who were visiting, and they too had a blast!  The staff are very cool,  and I think what was best about them was that at first wed picked a difficult room, and they advised us to reconsider.  I'm glad we did!! Prior to the room, we passed the time playing guitar hero, super mario  and cards against humanity.  A great selection of board games to choose from! We had a prison escape scenario...it was so well done!!! Looking forward to my next escape! I think this is a great team building activity....and certainly a super fun place to go with friends!"}
{"text":"Make sure you keep an eye out for the entrance because it can be easy to walk past! They have a huge selection of board games and video games to choose from, and a nice, spacious cafe to sit and play in. I tried a Strawberry Mint Smoothie that was refreshing and not too sweet. We did not try out the escape rooms due to limited time, but I've heard good things about them. It seems like a great place to visit with friends and relax/play for a couple hours."}
{"text":"We arrived here prior to a late dinner. I loved how they had gaming consoles and a small TV at each table, that was a lot of fun. Their boardgame selection was a little bare though.   We ordered the Japanese popcorn which was very good as well as a roast beef panini which came with a side of seasoned chips. Liked the sandwich but the chips were just ok for me.   I liked the detail on the matcha latte as well the sweetness level was perfect!   I'd definitely come back, perhaps to try their older console like super Nintendo or one of their escape rooms!   Loved the combination of gaming, escape rooms, board game, and cafe. A little something for everyone!  Last note, it's really great that they don't have a charge to play their games, you're just required to purchase food. Or drink!"}
{"text":".One of the new escape games that has been popping up all over Ontario. This one is the best one from what i have been. They offer free board games. The food were outstanding. Had the pizza panini and tried out the butter tart, matcha tea cookie and mango basil shake. The panini had amazing flavor. Gooey cheese with a great crunch. Butter tart was a diabetic attack in a bite which was expected. I wish the matcha peanut butter cookie had more matcha taste but overall had decent flavors. The escape games was challenging but fun. Awesome night."}
{"text":"Returned for Static as promised.  It definitely was the hardest room that I've tried so far.  The room was simple but complex at the same time.  My teammate was rendered somewhat useless because of a certain part of the game, fantastically done!  Stayed around the board game cafe after and enjoyed a great cup of jasmine tea.  Looking forward to the new rooms opening up!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a first come first serve basis and they don't limit you to a time. You only need to order a drink. It's super nice and cozy!! It's reasonably priced and it's a great place to go!!"}
{"text":"I like their escape rooms, i played two of them, fun themes and they are challenging. However i am giving a 2 due to the rude service by the girl who came in to give us a clue. She seemed annoyed and mumbled \"yea figure it out\" on her way out when I asked her to repeat herself as I did not hear her behind the wall. Another girl who plugged in our console to the tv at the table for drinks, had her butt hanging out when she bent over to plug it in... skirt was waaayyy too short if i can see half her butt/underwear, she also gave us the wrong remote controllers, didn't really acknowledge if she was done setting up or not, we had to ask another staff and he figured out it was the wrong controllers."}
{"text":"Riddle Room is a great place to spend some quality time with friends while enjoying a wide library of board games. Having been to many board games cafes already, I must say I had awesome time during my visit at Riddle Room and I consider it to be one of the best board games cafes in Toronto.   Their board game collection is very extensive, you can find a lot of the popular games there and for some of them Riddle Room keeps extra sets so more people can enjoy the games. I do find that they are more catered towards casual board gamers with more party games than strategic games, however. I find most of their board game to be fairly new and have been gently used with minimum missing pieces, which is awesome because it shows they are constantly maintaining their standard of board game offerings.    To play you just have to purchase an item first at the cashier and you get unlimited game time, unlike many other places where they only give you maximum 3 hours of play time per purchase. Please make your purchase first before you play to support the venue. Their drinks menu is pretty large, with a wide selection of drinks from coffee, latte, to smoothies and HK milk tea. Some of the drinks you can get either hot or cold. The prices are very reasonable as well, as I got my HK milk tea for around $3.75.   Other than the board games Riddle Room also offers Nintendo Wii consoles (saw a group playing Mario Kart), escape rooms, and also a Rage Room which allows you to express your suppressed inner anger and break some stuff.   P.S. I like how they have a Yelp check in special which you get an extra Rage Room item to break"}
{"text":"We did Static with 4 people, and it was definitely a tricky one! Mostly positive comments from everyone in the group, including:  1) Staff were awesome. Super friendly, and they let us finish the room once our time expired :) 2) Puzzles were varied, novel, and clever. 3) There's a board game cafe! We're planning to come back and do another room and then stay for a while after for food and games. I also noticed that they had at least a couple vegan snacks in the pastry display case.   The few minor negative comments we had were:  1) You could hear a lot of what was going on in other rooms which was a bit distracting and just killed the atmosphere a little bit. 2) There was no back-story given at the beginning, also making it a little less immersive 3) Some of the difficulty came from sloppy/messy set up of the puzzles. We got the feeling that the room had once looked awesome, but may require a bit of sprucing up & better regular maintenance.  But overall we had a good time! We'll be going again."}
{"text":"What a fun place!  I'm not good at figuring out all the clues but it's a great experience.  I love the board and video games.  The service here is great.  High recommend for date night or groups."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely incredible time at Riddle Room. Normally $25 seems expensive for a short one hour escape room experience, but in combination with a board game cafe is the perfect evening.   Go in for an escape room, have tons of fun. Come out and have a blast playing fun games with your friends. The price of playing board games is included in your escape room experience too!  The staff were incredible friendly and fun. Will 100% come back (maybe even tonight). Highly recommend.   The unexpected third part that's awesome is that they have a bunch of consoles that you can take out. N64s SNES, GameCube, you name it. So if you want you can borrow one and bring it over to one of the tables with TVs set up and have a killer time!  Get out there, have some fun!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The escape rooms are fun. They're pretty hard (at least for me) but yet still a fun way to spend an hour. I think it's been the same 4 rooms for a while now though. So I'm hoping they'll update the rooms at some point.  What I really like about this place is the games and cafe they have which is a fun to spend time at after doing the escape rooms. The food is pretty OK here. I thought the cakes were a little too sweet though. I'll skip that next time."}
{"text":"If you're here for the escape rooms, I would suggest  another location. The puzzles were not difficult at all. The escape room we did apparently had an escape rate of 30% which I find hard to believe. However, the board games, drinks, and the chill atmosphere are quite nice!"}
{"text":"Great escape room and reasonable priced, especially considering it includes the board game cafe. Staff were lovely and very helpful, and I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"To sum it up... great drinks, large variety of board and video games, affordable prices and a WHOLE LOT OF FUN! I absolutely love this board game cafe, and will need to try their escape rooms soon to give an opinion on that aspect.   There is no cover for the board game cafe. Instead, each person needs to purchase something off the menu before the table can start playing the board/video games available. I was afraid that the drinks would be expensive since there was no cover but the prices were VERY REASONABLE and wallet friendly! I got their matcha latte ($5.75) which came with a very cute bear latte art. I've also tried their lavender London fog ($5.25) and really enjoyed it. They also serve hot food (panini) and snacks (popcorn, chips).  There is a large variety of board games to choose from, and some games even have duplicate copies. Some games include: pictionary, settlers of catan, monopoly deal, Bang, jenga, exploding kittens, coup, and much much more... As for consoles, they have a couple like wii and Xbox.  As a heads up... - FREE WIFI: The password is written on the top left corner on the menu. - WASHROOM: You would need to get the key (there's two) near the entrance of the cafe.  - BOARD GAMES: Check to see if you have all the pieces needed to start the game... because I noticed some are missing.  All in all, would I come back again? Most definitely!"}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey for multiple people, as you pay by the person not by the room.  That said, if you're a smaller group it can end up be incredibly affordable, as you pay by the person not by the room.  The food is great - check out the butter tart, it's top notch.  The shakes?  Amazing!  The board games, and video games?  Totally makes sense.  Some other places with board games want you to drop money to hang out.  Instead, buy a $5.00 milk shake, and enjoy that, while playing all the games you want.  And if you're really feeling up to it - try out the escape rooms, because they're awesome.  No spoilers!"}
{"text":"I had a very short and cute experience on a weekday right after when they have opened. Try the lavender English fog, it is a tea latte with floral touches. I also tried their lemon pie. It was a bit too strong on sugar, but it tasted okay. They seem to have lots of board games and other options. I will try it again when crowded sometime."}
{"text":"I came here everytime there was a themed cafe, today there was a Fate Series Cafe being held by some awesome cosplayers, the chocolate cake is yummy and dense but soft, the tea was yummy. I had lots of fun hanging out with friends and playing the fate themed games"}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance !! We had such a good time there the drinks are stiff we will definetly be back"}
{"text":"Got here and found out there is no cover charge to play board games in their cafe, just need to order something to drink or eat, which is really cool. I think it was for a special event though. The place was packed though... There weren't a lot of tables compared to other game cafes.  Our table got the pizza panini, veggie panini, nutella latte, and reese latte. We got our paninis fairly quickly, it came with a side of dressed up fries and a dipping sauce. Really cool flavours. The paninis were around $6+tax each.  Their lattes took a bit longer to get to our table. They were making latte art, and it looked so cute. The staff here are very welcoming and also cleared our tables promptly.  I would definitely recommend giving this place a visit."}
{"text":"Finally got around to going to this place last weekend! I have to say, it was a tad bit disappointing, largely due to the excellent reviews on here. I had high expectations of course. However, we were met with terrible customer service and unstable, shaky tables with its legs constantly popping off. Now, the crappy table, I can let that slide.... but the unprofessional customer service just ticked us off.   My boyfriend and I were getting ready to play with the Wii U, but had trouble hooking it up to the TV (don't judge, we've never touched a Wii U in our lives before LOL). We asked an employee for help, but she seemed busy so she said she would be right back. Alright, understandable.... Luckily though, we somehow managed to get it working ourselves. Same girl comes back with the drink we ordered, places it on the table, looks at us for about a second, and turns around without even saying anything. Talk about rude! She probably thought that since we got it to work, she can just casually turn her back on us without saying anything, but I think she could have at least acknowledged the fact that we got it to work, and asked us if we needed any more help. We were pretty appalled by the unfriendly attitude :(   All in all, it's a great place to hang out, but I just hope the owners would encourage their employees to be more friendly and approachable. We won't hesitate to come back, so long as we don't see that same girl there again LOL"}
{"text":"Hi, I have visited riddle room multiple times I can say that I am a very loyal customer, but unfortunately, I left today feeling very upset. The workers today seemed extremely passive aggressive. We requested to use a console and the worker only dropped off the game cartridge. We waited a good amount of time before asking about the console again, only to have one worker roll their eyes at my friend. We felt very unwelcomed and I have never felt that way before at Riddle Room. VERY DISAPPOINTED! I have also misplaced at my headphones at riddle room. I called back literally a half hour later. I understand that if I lose my own belongings it is on me, but there was just something off about the person on the phone. There was no sense of concern in her voice and seemed like she just wanted to get off tbe phone. It was also strangely odd how she fast told me that my headphones were not at the booth we were sitting at. I'm going to call back tomorrow to hopefully talk to other employees. She said without any hesitation which makes me believe she didn't check at all. I'm going to call back tomorrow to hopefully talk to other employeesI'm not sure if my friends and I will ever come back, especially with those"}
{"text":"This is THE place to be. They have a great selection of games, including video games which is something other game cafes don't have. They also have a great menu, and the Japanese popcorn is the best! I haven't done the escape room there, though I am trying to find a time to."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday late afternoon to check out the game selection as an alternative to snakes and lattes. I appreciate that there is no cover fee, but there is also no service. We stood awkwardly at the front for a few minutes before we accepted that no one was going to come either to the bar area or to let us know how it worked. We sat down expecting someone to come by... which didn't happen. We didn't get to order a drink because there was never an employee behind the service counter, and no one came to ask. We awkwardly checked out one of the games but mostly sat there, chatting at an empty table, for a good hour and a half before leaving. Decent game selection, but overall not the ideal choice."}
{"text":"How amazing is this place!!  I'm from Toronto but now live in Vancouver. Before heading back to Toronto for a visit, I noticed a Review of the Day on Yelp for Riddle Room and told my best friend (in Toronto) that I wanted to check this place out. He told me he already had it in mind and that this place was awesome. Is it ever!  Three of us arrived on a Sunday with the intention of playing some N64 and boardgames but I was enticed by the escape rooms. For $25 on weekends, or $20 during the week, you get a few options on different escape room experiences. We decided on Framed.   I won't go into too much detail about the room, but it was fantastic. We ended up getting out with just over 7 minutes to spare and using only one hint. One thing I really liked about this escape room is that you can ask for as many hints as you want, so you actually have a chance to get out and feel successful. You also get use of the photobooth when you escape! If you escape, with no hints, under a certain time limit, Riddle Room offers you free drinks (non-alcoholic). Amazing!  The staff is also outstanding. They're so friendly, helpful and so sincere. When we got out of the room, they let us know we could play any of the games available. Even before we went through the escape room, we made small chit-chat with them and it felt like we were all friends that went way back.    I had such a good time at Riddle Room that I actually came back again before the end of my trip (where I got a hot chocolate with the most beautiful design on it).   Thank you Riddle Room for the amazing customer service and awesome experience! We need you in Vancouver!"}
{"text":"I love escape rooms! This place had some great pros and some lame cons, so I am only giving it 3 stars. We did the Castle room, and there were 4 of us.  Pros:  *in a board game cafe, which you can play in for free after! *puzzles were very fun and thoughtful *room was thematic and immersive - thus counts as a major pro for me! *super fun photo booth with props if you win  Cons: *no opening story! No set up! Although the room was immersive, it could have used a nice set up *No one greeted us when we first arrived or noticed once we had completed the room  (maybe a side effect of being attached to a board game cafe that is quite busy?) *our room apparently only had a 30% success rate, but we finished in plenty of time (I suppose this could also be argued as a pro, but for my group it was a con) *while the puzzles themselves were difficult and thoughtful (a plus in my book), there weren't that many puzzles. In other escape rooms, I've found we naturally split off to solve things. For this room, all 4 of us seemed to always be working on one puzzle together. I would have preferred the amount of hard puzzles they had, with some easier puzzles thrown in (like having to simply find a key in a drawer - just as a way to bulk up the content).  Overall good, and we had fun, but definitely some room for improvement!"}
{"text":"So this isn't your average escape room or entertainment cafe. It does both and it does both really really well. The escape rooms have amazing ambiance with a lot of attention to detail, immersion and we'll thought out riddles. Best escape I've done and a great value.  The cafe is a lot of fun with a friendly barista staff. The drinks are made well and if you're a coffee connoisseur they have some interesting alternate brewing methods. There's no door cover to play the board games or old school video games. It's a great place to chill with friends and grab an espresso or panini."}
{"text":"This place is actually my second home. When I first came to riddle room, I didn't know what to expect. I use to always go to places like Castle and Snakes and Lattes, but once I took those steps through the door, I was instantly hooked. Old school games, board games, escape rooms, latte art, japanese popcorn, great staff, and most importantly,  NO COVER CHARGE!   I hate it when I want to spend the afternoon with some friends at other board game cafes but forced to pay attention to the time because I'm paying per hour.  At riddle room, the rule is to just buy something. So whether it is a $5 nutella latte (so good) or $1.75 seasoned chips, it just feels you're getting the bang for your buck.  The atmosphere is also a lot more homey, unlike some other places that are really dimmed and makes it hard to play the games.   The escapes rooms are also really fun and pretty challenging.  There are currently 4 rooms at RR, and i've done every room except for one (Luci's Room). My team and I made it on the leaderboards for framed (5th best time) and even though we got knocked off like a few days later, it is a life achievement that I will never forget (just kidding).  The price for escape rooms on weekdays is only $20 ($25 on weekends), and since they partnered up with my UTSG (University of Toronto St. George) student group CASS (Canadian Asian Student Society), I am able to get a complimentary drink after every escape room session!  CASS members just have to show their membership cards to one of the workers before doing the rooms. Pretty awesome perk if I do have to say so myself.  :)   The coffee here is amazing, the smoothies are sweet, the popcorns and chips have special seasoning that no other place can replicate, and the cheesecakes are hella good.   Everyone should totally come drop by and try Riddle Room for themselves and I'm almost certain that you will want to return again in the future."}
{"text":"Such a fun and unique experience! My husband and I did an escape room and found it challenging and exciting. While we waited for the escape room to be ready we played board games (Connect 4 & Guess Who).  After our escape we ordered drinks and played Mario Kart. It was a great date night!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place so much.   Essentially, you need to at least buy one item on the menu. I got the hazelnut latte and my boyfriend got the Hong Kong milk tea. Both were pretty good and the lattes come with latte art which is super cute!   There are tables in the middle and booths on the sides as well as two big TVs that they can hook a system up to so you can play various games. The booths on the sides also have small TVs. At the front they have a list of all the different games they have. It was awesome to get to play Mario Kart and enjoy our drinks at the same time!   The tables in the center are for board games and this place has A LOT of board games. We didn't get a chance to play any because of Mario Kart but it looked like they had a very wide selection.   This is a great place to hangout with friends or even go on a date! They have escape rooms as well.   My only complaint is the staff was not very friendly but you don't have to interact with them too much unless you're ordering or picking a game out.   Overall, this place is a great hangout spot and I would definitely recommend it, though it gets crowded so pick the time you go wisely."}
{"text":"I MISS BEING A KID AGAIN!!!  matcha lattes (~$5) with cute bear latte art soooo many board games to choose from video games great snacks best part, all the games are free and the food and drinks are not only delicious but more than reasonably priced!!  this is a great place for dates and catching up with frds!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband stopped by for a few hours on Friday night and had a total blast. We arrived at about 4:30 pm, and most tables were empty. There is no cover charge or fee - you only have to purchase something and then can sit there for as long as you want. There's no time limit for the table. We purchased a latte, a fruity tea (free water refills) and the Japanese popcorn. The prices on the coffees were quite reasonable, but I thought $3 for tea was pretty steep (haha). I didn't mind at all though, since there is no cover charge - they have to make money somehow!  We sat down at a booth with a TV. We first played a few board games, but then got the Wii hooked up and played Mario Kart (soooo fun). They have a great selection of board games, video game consoles and video games. The staff come to the table and set up the gaming console for you. We also played Mario Party, and had so much fun. I thought the price was REALLY reasonable for the amount of time we spent there and the amount of fun we had. We will definitely be back.   A few things to note. One thing I really like about Snakes + Lattes that Riddle Room lacks, is someone coming around to explain the games to you or recommend a game. This isn't the end of the world, considering the difference in price, but just something to note. I also wish there was better selection of snacks. They have paninis, chips and popcorn and that's it. It would be nice if there were more easy food options. It was also quite cold by the end of our playing time since the front door was open. For the price though, these things aren't deal breakers for us."}
{"text":"Great escape room with nice cafe area with board games!  With the escape rooms popping up like mushrooms all around - it is getting hard to stand out from the crowd. Riddle room has done a great job - we did their hardest room which I will not give away the details but the puzzles were well thought out and the room design was good.  Afterwards, we hung out in the cafe area which is free after you paid for your escape room and they have a good sizeable assortment of board games. It is not the same scale as Snakes and Lattes but they have all sorts of light to heavy strategy that you can play.  Staff is friendly and it looks like this is going to be one my regular board game spots!"}
{"text":"Very cool concept. Came in here to kill some time before a flight. They have a wealth of board games and console games with all the classics from your NES to your Wii to your PS4.  The place was packed out when we arrived so clearly a popular choice. No cover charge needed, all they require is that you buy at least one item per person from their onsite cafe (which has a very wide selection) and the table / selection of games is yours for as long as you want. No cover charge. I do however struggle to see how they make good money with that pricing model, but hey that's not my problem.  Overall good fun for a group of friends looking for a chilled day"}
{"text":"Really nice environment and awesome snacks too! My favourite snack is the Japanese popcorn and it's only $1.75. They have a wide variety of games and lots of console games as well that you can play on their TV's. It's just a bit crowded every time I went so you might have to wait a bit for the games you want."}
{"text":"Venue was clean, well-lit, and quite appealing. Staff was friendly. Matcha latte wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but the artwork was creative and very well done. Drinks are on the pricey side, but there is no minimum $$$ to stay and play games. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Riddle Room is so good! We tried \"Anatomy\", which was a 3/5 difficulty, and it was super fun. Also there were a lot of board games available and they were in very good condition. Will definitely come back to try the other rooms!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at an Escape Room and I wouldn't want to go to any other. We did Framed and got out with just a couple minutes left to spare and it was just the right level in terms of difficulty. I love that it's a board game cafe and an escape room - it provides such a fun atmosphere with flexibility. Plus they have console games too! And awesome Tetris lamps. I need to find out where to get me some of those. I really enjoyed the popcorn and the beautiful latte. Definitely need to try some of their other menu items. The staff here are unbelievably amazing, literally the best service I've had, EVER. I love that they're super friendly and approachable. A huge shout out to Dennis!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Riddle Room a couple of times just to chill, but never done an escape room. That being said, it's an awesome place to come and play board games at. They have a pretty big selection, and my friends and I have never found ourselves bored at any time. They also have a large TV with an N64 console if you want to play video games. There is no admission fee for the board game cafe, although all they really require for you is to make a food or beverage purchase. They have a good selection of smoothies as well as hot drinks, and will make really fun latte art for you! The guy making the art was super friendly and chatted with us and also takes requests, like if you want him to make you an elephant or something random and unique. Both times I've been here it hasn't been super busy (weekend afternoons in the summer), but the good thing about that is that it allows the staff to be super attentive, and if you have any requests they will gladly try their best to accommodate it. I also love the decor in here and the little Tetris lights they have on every table :)"}
{"text":"Riddle Room is the best board games cafe in Toronto. Tommy always hooks it up two in da plug every time I show up. Thanks homie. Being a gangsta is made hella easy when you can go to Riddle Room and play old school Dreamcast and drink baller coffee made by David the fittest most handsome individual outta that joint. He has nice muscles."}
{"text":"Love this place. My boyfriend and I discovered this place a month ago and has been here regularly. The staff are super nice. They have a great collection of games. The lattes art are also amazing."}
{"text":"I used to only know how to play Guess Who and the Monopoly but thanks to my friends and this wonderful place its grown to 10!   Ive been to several board games across Toronto and I must say this place definitely lives up to its 5 star reviews. Theres no \"sneaky fees\", the food is actually editable plus the milkshakes are friggin delicious and affordable.   If you're not into board games they also have a handful of selection of throwback classic games on hand for you to choose from.   I can see myself coming back again in the near future."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my friends. I appreciate how they organized their board games based on number of players, it made it more convenient for our group of 6. I ordered the strawberry milkshake and it was alright. However my friends really enjoyed their selection of teas! Overall, lovely experience and more affordable than most board game cafes."}
{"text":"I've never tried out any of the escape rooms, so keep that in mind, but as a board game & video game cafe, this place is perfect! It's cheaper than other places around Toronto, as there isn't a general entry fee, they just require you to purchase a food/drink item from the front. Staff are super nice and friendly & the food and drinks are very good - albeit a little pricey, but can't complain too much as there's no entry fee. This place is also not wheelchair accessible as well. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for a chill night. Really off the wall board games (Telestrations!), yummy Dufflet desserts, coffees and milkshakes.  Open late. Great low key night and good vibes."}
{"text":"Loved it! Played games and had a great fresh berry smoothie. When asking someone who seemed to be owner or manager (very familiar and interested to help) he was great!!! When ordering the smoothie though, I asked if it was an option that many choose and the employee at the register replied with \"I mean I work here, I'm not going to say anything is bad...\" I feel that it's normal to ask what is commonly ordered. I would order another drink if the smoothie wasn't popular. Maybe let them know that advice on orders is helpful."}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends. Really fun. Good stuff to munch and sip. Great setup and people. Would go for hangouts when im in the area."}
{"text":"Alright Toronto, you are starting to bring your A-game.  There's a new, and improved player in the boardgame/videogame cafe scene and it's going to be exciting times ahead for all of us.   What turned out to be only a trip to a nearby late night cafe for us became a real Kinder-Surprise. We only wanted a nice cup of tea and coffee but Riddle Room offered more -- alot more.   The guys running the place are really easy going and there's this sense of community among its people who are here just having fun and playing boardgames and video games. We saw how comfortable people were in exchanging hellos and introducing themselves to others at different tables. Very nice vibe here, all in all.   Will be back again to try out all their games ( \"free\" as long as you order a drink/food/popcorn - their Japanese Popcorn is prettyyy nice)"}
{"text":"Before Riddle Room, i didn't know game rooms existed.  My friends brought me there and that's when i started to learn to play various board games.  It's a popular spot, and the room is always packed during the weekends.  There are many games to choose from.  Some of the games are so old that there are missing pieces. It's  free to play the games there.  The only thing you have to do is to buy a drink or a snack.  The choices on the menu are pretty decent. It really is a nice place to hang out with friends if you are into board games."}
{"text":"I loved this place- the games, the staff, the lattes; everything is above par! Unlike most places around the city, there is no cover charge for playing the board games, which is so great. You only have to order something to eat/drink, which I would have done eitehr way (and the latte art is spectacular FYI) Would definitely reccomend it to anyone looking to have a fun and unique bday experience, or for a challenging team building excercise, or basically just anyone looking to have an all around good time! Will definitely be going back here often - great place! :)"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere! The first board came + escape room place that I've been to and it has the Wii, Rock Band, etc. Will definitely be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, a wide selection of board games, video games, AND escape rooms! What more can you ask for? I can't begin to calculate the time I've spent in this place, or the amount of caffeinated products I've consumed at Riddle Room. The atmosphere is just wonderful and the food is splendid. A definite gem in the city!"}
