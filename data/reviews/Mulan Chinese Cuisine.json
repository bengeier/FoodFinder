{"text":"I ordered a chicken fried rice. I got 95% rice and 5% chicken. Pics needed on the menu. Waste of $5.60"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 15 years. Prices haven't changed and food is the best bang for buck you can find anywhere. Even though I don't live in the area anymore I still drop in as often as I can.. Deep fried spicey squid is my fave on their menu but I've never been disappointed with anything I've ever ordered!"}
{"text":"Good value and tasty.  This place is located in a strip mall opposite the science center.  There are quite a few good fopd spots there including shaheen tikka, but i dropped in to try the noodle soup brisket.  After placing my order, i waited not long and chef brought it out.  Good size portion and tasty, best of all good price.  Next day i tried Sichuan shrimp takeout and although the fried rice wasn't as good as  i expected, the portion size and cost for $6 was to be expected.  Nice spot to drop in for a lunch combo."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden treasure! Their food is very flavourful, and I love coming back here. Very cheap (especially the specials), but it may not look well on the inside of the restaurant. Many disregard the interior and exterior appearance, but have a taste and you'll be amazed. Recommend the Shanghai Noodles, Egg Foo Yong, Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Wonton Noodle Soup, and Chicken Wings!"}
{"text":"This is my local place to order Chinese.  It's not haute-cuisine. This is you standard hot, greasy, salty, fattening Chinese food that you order as a guilty pleasure. It's dependable, inexpensive and very tasty. You DO NOT want to eat in.  Go pick up or get take out.  The service... they mean well, but it's terrible. I don't care - I just want my Mulan Fried Rice."}
{"text":"Ok, to begin with, do not dine in.  It's not an attractive place to enjoy your meal.  Now, let's get to the food.  It is GOOD, I mean GOOD and a reasonable price.  We order there all the time (take out) and I really like the food there.  It is our guilty pleasure and hangover food, so yes we are talking salt and grease (for the greasy foods we order).  I would highly recommend the Cantonese Chow Mein which is my favourite and hubby really likes the Hunan anything and hot and sour soup.  I don't recommend the rice, for some reason it has a weird taste.  The restaurant itself and the fact that they give you a small order of spareribs with your order over $25 (give me a break people, if you are saying you get a free order or something, don't give a quarter order) is the reason I give it a 4 star.  The prices cannot be beat and the portions are fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is becoming a lunchtime favourite since I've started working in the area, but lets start by getting out of the way the fact that this place is in Flemingdon Park, and is much like all the restaurants in this little strip mall. We're talking no frills type eating. If you want a nice dining environment or even well maintained bathrooms, you're in the wrong part of town. But if you're looking for some quick and cheap for take out, this is a gem of a spot.   There are always good specials and most have pictures in the place to help with the selection process. Most meals are a combination of meat with a bit of veggies over rice or noodles or sorts. I've had the chicken curry on steamed rice, the szechuan chicken over fried rice, and today the Singapore curried rice noodle with shrimp and pork (minus the shrimp on request). The curry is a little bland and generic yellow curry but with some hot sauce thrown in was pretty good. The szechaun chicken had a good level of spice but a really nice flavour to it. Not just spice for the sake of being spicy. The Singapore curried rice noodle was delicious. Again, limited spice in the curry but the rice noodle and bean sprouts and veggies all mixed up worked very well together.  Each meal has cost in the $5 to $6.25 ballpark after tax, and was a hefty amount of food which in the case of the chicken rice combo's, I was actually able to have enough leftovers for leftovers! All in all, for cheap and quick food with good portions and decent flavours, this place is certainly worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Love their Cantonese Chow Mein with big shrimps, tender chicken slices & fresh mix vegetables. Also the Satay sauce beef rice noodle soup is my other favorite. Tender beef and fresh mince green peppers & yummy sauteed soup, little bit 2 greasy though. Always order these 2 dishes and never get turn down. The price are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever! Hardly any chicken in chicken dish. Horrible to taste. Stay away!"}
{"text":"While looking at different restaurants in the area, came upon this restaurant posting and decided to try it, as it is down the street from work.  Not bad when you want something slightly cheaper than Congee Star. It is a mix of chinese and choy suey menu."}
{"text":"Old school Canadian-Chinese fast food, done really well... You get incredible portions for a good cheap price. Come here if you feel you haven't had enough salt or MSG in your diet.  Give them 15 minutes if you want to order the fried chicken.  Be prepared to pay 50 cents for sweet and sour sauce on the side. What's that? Sweet and sour sauce isn't authentic Chinese? If you're not the type to want sweet and sour sauce on the side, well, maybe that tells you all you need to know about whether you'll like Mulan!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Mulan fifteen minutes before they closed, because Sunny Supermarket's food court was already shut down for the night.   Well geez. Darn cheap and darn tasty. Looks like an aging McDonald's but smells a whole lot better. Don't tell my boss that I skipped over the more authentic looking items for the sweet-and-sour chicken, which did not disappoint. I ate half for dinner last night and half for lunch today.   This grungy little plaza is full of treasure. I have to decide whether to try something else next time I'm there, or just go back to Mulan."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years now and have not been disappointed. In terms of their food, they are very well known for their fried chicken wings. I had some today and they are very unique to all the other wings I've tried (must try if you haven't already)!  Also, this place stays true to its roots - Cantonese-styled dishes; generous portions and quick to make. Although the restaurant isn't as aesthically pleasing, the food speaks wonders. It has been in the neighbourhood for as long as I can remember (perhaps 2 decades) and has rightfully been able to maintain its business through its loyal customers.  If you're looking for cheap, fast, and tasty food - this is a must go!"}
{"text":"I work nearby this area, and I come here often. The food is fair for what you pay for. I especially like their fried chicken wings. They are crispy and delicious.  I would totally recommend my friends to eat here."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I decided to try out a place near our work since we are getting sick of the cafe food downstairs and across the way (expensive/bad). Word got around that Mulan was actually a good place to check out and eat, being in Flemingdon Park. We were all a little skeptical as everything on the menu was under 6 dollars, but there was a lot of people eating there, so they must be doing something right.   I ordered the shanghai noodles which had pork and shrimp in it. It was in my hands within 10 minutes and was piping hot! Huge portions for 5.35. I came back to my office and was extremely surprised and satisfied with my  order. It only lacked some veggies but I can only imagine this is what street food is like in Hong Kong. Hidden gem for sure, however the inside is a sight for sore eyes (but I wouldn't want it any other way). Will head back for sure!"}
