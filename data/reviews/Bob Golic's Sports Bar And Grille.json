{"text":"Meh,   This place is alright.  Went for some food and drinks the night before a game.  It wasn't crowded at all and the food was standard bar fare.   The whole city seemed dead after the game on Sunday so we went back just for a burger and the place closed at 9.  Kind of weird to close at 9 during football season when the Sunday Night game is on, but whatever.  They did hook us up and give us a token to take down the street to a bar that was still open for a free drink.  I know Cleveland isn't the mecca of nightlife but I think I'll roam elsewhere if I ever go back."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!!!! I have no clue how the doors are still open. The food is beyond bad. There is never anyone in this place. They make all there money during the Browns home games each year. If I wanted to eat frozen nuked food I would just stay home. Hey Bob, stick to your acting career. Oh wait that sucked also! Epic Fail."}
{"text":"We stopped by at 5:30 on a Thursday night to check this place out and they were closed! The TV's were on, but no one was inside and the doors were locked. The hours said it should be open, but I guess they don't want business at dinner time.."}
{"text":"Helloooo, nip slip central!   We came here on a Friday night looking to relax with some drinks before heading out to the clubs and getting our dance on. I didn't know what to expect, because I've honestly never even glanced in the direction of this place. We were a group of 6 and there were maybe 6 others in the bar, scattered about a jungle of chairs. Our bartender was nice (very flirty toward the boys, which was actually kind of entertaining), but her nip kept slipping. And when I say kept, I mean we saw it most of the time we were at the bar and they weren't quick slips either...shiver. The long island that was placed in front of me was almost impossible to drink, it was so strong (and I guess that's a good thing, but not if you're me and you just like beer), so I traded off with someone else and got a nice Dale's Pale Ale. The only problem was the fact that there was barely any atmosphere and there was some fighting/making out going on in one corner...I couldn't figure it out.   Overall, the service was nice and better than most places in the area, so I'll be back. I'd also like to try some of the food sometime and really give this place a good solid chance."}
{"text":"Wandered quite far after a basketball game, and after photographing Browns Stadium, felt it was necesarry to visit Golic's namesake. After seeing a Greek Salad on the menu in the entryway, we solidified our choice. When we entered, it was quite empty, but seemed charming for a sports bar. There was only one waitress/bartender, and while there was another woman wandering around, I'm not sure what she was doing and how she was contributing to the restaurant production, but our waitress was frazzled.Anyways, the menu in the entryway was an outdated one, and I learned they no longer served Greek salads. Grudgingly, I chose a Caesar Salad, and my boyfriend chose the chicken caesar wrap, which was accompanied by fries. I chose a Lake Erie Breeze and my boyfriend chose a Dirty Lake Erie- both which ended up being $3, score!! The cocktails were tasty, and the food was typical bar fare quality and tasty enough. The prices were very good, and the waitress was apologetic about being frazzled. There didn't seem to be too much else going on outside the football stadium (especially in comparison to the strip near the Q and Progressive Field), so I think this would be a generally solid choice for this part of town."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it. I did. But this was just so ridiculous that I am sadly only awarding one star.  My friend from Atlanta was in town for the 2012 NFC Championship game, Falcons vs. 49ers, which was playing at 3pm on a Sunday. I had never been to Bob Golic's, but there's a football helmet outside the door - what better sports bar to go to?  We step inside at 2:30 pm, and the bar is EMPTY. Music is playing (instead of pregame coverage), and three employees are standing around. We take seats at the bar, right in front of the TV, and order a beer each. The bartender brings us our drinks, and we ask for menus - ordering some chicken fingers.  As we're sipping our beers, my friend asks if they can change the sound to the game.  It's at this point the the bartender informs us that the bar will be closing at 3. That's right - the sports bar will close at the same time as kickoff for the NFC championship. Furthermore, we're the first customers they've had all day.  Look - I get it, business is slow and everyone wanted to go home. I'm not saying you should keep the bar open for just two people (although Little Johnny's did, went we went by later!). But I was shocked and angry that she let us order not just drinks but food, with the knowledge that the place was closing in half an hour, without even a warning.  My beer was cold and the chicken fingers were good, but I had to chug and scarf them down so that we could move somewhere to actually watch the game.  Pretty bad for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Did you know the SWEET 16 play this weekend?  Even tho we live in the area we seldom go to golics.  We are avid sport fans and seek out places to watch games with friends often.  We tried to stop in at Golics last weekend during the NCAA games on Friday night (were they were playing downtown in CLE).  Apparently, the manager only scheduled one bartender (whom also had to wait tables at the same time).  The poor girl was on the verge of tears.  We left not wanting to add to her stress.    Last night, Thursday, we stopped in for dinner and the staff was unable to put both of the MARCH MADDNESS games on !  Really A SPORTS BAR can't find the games.  We tried to help by looking up the channels for them on our phones.  They still could not get the games on.  Sadly we gave up... Not sure we will try Golics again,  Too bad the burger was good."}
{"text":"Bob Golics has Friendly staff and great food under new management things seem to be going in the right direction It's a blast on game days And it really has the neighborhood pub feel Keep it up Golics love your place And the burgers are phenomenal And pricing is very fair compared to a lot of other places surrounding"}
{"text":"Went here on  a Monday afternoon. NOT ONE PERSON IN THE PLACE wich is pretty much the norm for Cleveland I guess. Anyways, Atmosphere is nice, your typical sports bar. Food was average at best. The only reason we went here was becuase it was close to the Rock n Roll museum."}
{"text":"Stopped at Bob Golic's on the way back to the parking lot from a Browns game.  We actually passed it, remarking on how nice it looked inside, walked up to the next corner, then decided to go back and give it a try while we waited for traffic to thin out.  The four of us are season ticket holders, so we are downtown frequently during the season.  It's very nice inside, lots of big screen TVs, lots of tables.  Looks like it would be a nice place to hang out for a game.  We were there around 11PM and they still had a nice crowd.  To start with, two servers approached our table at the same time and appeared to have a slight disagreement over who got our table.  Very amusing.  Our server was very friendly, took our drink orders, then promptly brought my friend the wrong beer.  She promptly corrected this.  Time to take our orders from the tiny after-hours menu - had about 5 appetizers, two or three salads, and a few sandwiches to choose from.  We ordered nachos - nope, they're out of nachos.  Chips and salsa?  Goes without saying, I guess, that if you're out of nachos you're out of chips and salsa.  OK, then chicken wings.  Out of those, too.  That left us with two appetizers to choose from - chicken tenders and potato skins.  OK, we'll have those.  Our friends (who are from Toledo) wondered how long it had been open, that they could run out of nachos and wings on a Saturday night AND a football game day.  Friend to server: \"You're out of everything?  Did you just open?\"  Server: \"No, we opened at noon.\"  If nothing else, they were keeping us laughing.  Our server was very attentive, though - did a great job keeping the drinks refilled and asking us if we needed anything else.  Our food came pretty quickly and both the skins and tenders were good and hot.  My husband spotted Bob Golic on the other side of the bar; we thought we'd ask the server to send him over.  Our friends are both self-employed so we thought, if our name was on the sign outside we'd like to know when things aren't going so well.  Within a minute or so, though, he was gone.  Overall, I would go back, I just think I'd go earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Poor Bob Golic's Sports Bar.  Each time I've been in there it's been very dead.  Maybe 5-10 people each time.  Of course I usually just pony up to the bar and grab a beer and an appetizer.  The food here is typical of a sports bar.  I really enjoy the flat bread type pizzas he has.  They are paper thin crusts with lots of cheesy goodness.  I kind of laughed them off at first but ate my words soon afterward and nearly the whole \"pizza\".  I would have no problem trying anything on the menu.  Service was good, probably cause they were not that busy.  Overall I really think that is not in a very good location for sports bars.  Parking stinks and W. 6th is really a party crowd TH-SAT but dead all other days.  I never hear any kind of Golic promotions besides see him on the pregame program.  I do think the potential is there though and hope that someone comes along with the advise he needs to turn this into a great sports bar with tasty treats that have people coming back for more.  My fingers are crossed."}
{"text":"Plays loud heavy metal music instead of providing volume to the games on tv. There was a total of 6 people in the whole place (7 pm Sat night). My cocktails, although made well, came in a rotation of plastic and glass glasses. BBQ and hot wings were really great (fried, not baked).  We ordered a couples burgers  and although they looked delicious they had a funny \"cleaner\" taste to them. After a couple attempts to remake and discussions with the cook we gave up and walked down to Bar Louie for something to eat.  Really disappointing outing.  I just wasn't expecting it to be so bad."}
{"text":"By the time i grab my books and i give myself a look, i'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by! The corner of west 6th and lakeside that is. For \"date night\" (we' re getting up there in age), the wife and I chose former Brown and more importantly former Saved by the Bell star, Bob Golic's located in the whorehouse district. There are great views of west sixth and Browns stadium. We went around 7 pm and the foot traffic was fairly steady. Housed in an old brick building and boasting exposed duct work(that's original), Golic' s is littered with flat screens, sports jerseys and generic beer paraphernalia. It's very airy and open.  Now the food. We started with fried zucchini. It was decent enough. Then i ordered the fish and chips. My wife had the veggie wrap. Her wrap had a colorful array of veggies and rice in it, and came with a side of sweet potato fries. My plate arrived looking like Medusa' s head had been deep fried. I thought what manner of fish is this twisted? Apparently, grouper was somewhere in the mutated funnel cake that was my food. I barely tasted it. Oh yeah, i'm not a great vegetarian. I hate the sea and everything in it, and I will eat anything with gills. The chips were bland fries. The highlight for me was the freshly poured Brooklyn lager. Nothing worse than a flat beer from the tap(grog shop). Our server was a nice girl in sky high wedges. How did she walk in those? Can Bob Golic walk in those?  All in all, Golic's is in a great spot, has okay enough food and is named after someone who probably partied with Screech. I'll be coming back in the fall."}
