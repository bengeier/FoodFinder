{"text":"The food is terrific, everything down from meat to potato! The servers are also very friendly and utterly delightful. This is the perfect hidden gem."}
{"text":"Do not hesitate to try this place out! Food is amazing and the service is always exceptional. Chef G is an incredible chef and and the waitresses are wonderful. Do not be deceived by the appearance of the place. The food is truly incredible. If you're a snob and need a fabulous \"ambience\" to enjoy good food then maybe a chain restaurant with reheated frozen food is more up your alley. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Had dinner there and breakfasts. Good menus for both, the breakfast is the real standout. Food is great, but I can't give it more stars due to the run down location that is off putting as well as small and cramped when busy at popular times. Would love to see this restaurant in a new location or after a major renovation."}
{"text":"Duck eggs bene. No need to say anymore. Sweet, savoury, eggs perfectly poached. So good"}
{"text":"4 stars because I've been here a couple of times but have only had breakfast  If you're an Eggs Benedict fan, this is your place, there's about a dozen different Eggs Benny on offer at all times. Brunch is available on Saturday and Sunday only, service is warm, friendly and relaxed"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance fool you, best breakfast I have ever had! Always busy and small restaurant so sometimes there is a wait, but it's always worth it!"}
{"text":"Looks like a hole in the wall but don't let that fool you. The menu was extensive especially the specials. Prices were good, house red was tasty & service was friendly. Great little spot."}
{"text":"Being in a small town 10 minutes north of Newmarket, When you first pull up you may think twice about going in BUT the food here is amazing! Been here multiple times for breakfast / brunch and never been let down. The smoked salmon eggs Benedict is delicious. It's a small place with few staff and is usually packed so sometimes you will have to be patient but there is lots to observe inside with its quirky decor. Will return again and again."}
{"text":"Yep, I'm going there with a five star review!   I went for brunch with some friends this past Saturday after a baseball tournament. We had to sit at different tables because there was 10 of us without a resso.   I ordered the florentine eggs Benny. It was fantastic! The home made hollandaise sauce was unreal. The flavour of the spinach, mushrooms, goat cheese and onions just melded together so nicely. I could eat that for breakfast every day. Their hash browns were portioned generously and were perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his chicken sandwich, too. He felt the size was satisfying and liked how it was crispy it was.   Even though my beverage didn't make its way to the table, I'm not going to hinder the rating because the food was incredible. A girlfriend who doesn't always enjoy home made hollandaise sauce tried some and really liked it. I 100% will recommend this place for brunch to anyone who is looking.   Don't forget to check out their special board. There must've been 6 other eggs Benny options including duck breast, roast beef and avocado bacon."}
{"text":"I get lost everyone I try to find this place I always go the wrong way and end up having to turn a million turns but it's worth it.    I have the preface by saying my mom makes the best cinnamon rolls in the world, but these guys are a close second!  So order it!   I love that these guys take the traditional breakfast and add to it.  Their eggs Benedict combinations are heavenly :)!    Also wonderful Cesar's.  This is our new breakfast spot!!!!!   Try it out!  Give them a call if you get lost haha!"}
{"text":"After driving by Tatlows for several years and thinking it was a Tattoo parlor, I heard from a friend that it was not only a restaurant but a fantastic place to visit.  We have since been there twice, once as a couple and the second time with one of our sons.  There is a small parking lot in front and when you enter the restaurant you are greeted with a very warm and inviting atmosphere.  The first time was a Saturday night, so we did wait about 10 minutes, no problem since it gave us time to review the specials.  Once seated, our drink order was taken and we continued to ponder over the menu.  This is one of the hidden surprises.  This place has everything from Chicken Fingers & Poutine to Lamb Chops & Lobster.  The prices also range, so don't be afraid to stop in and experience what they have to offer.  My husband ordered the Mussels, no surprise, but here's the deal.  I don't like Mussels.  I love seafood, but Mussels are just plain gross.  Well, let me tell you, I am now a Mussel convert.  At least at Tatlows.  The crusty bread combined with the tomato-garlic broth and the mussels, had me eating half of my husbands appetizer.  I can't honestly remember what we ordered for our main dish, it was good I'm sure, but I the mussels were just so amazing.  We went back a second time, with our son, who not surprisingly had the Chicken Fingers, his order was so large, he didn't finish it.  Most likely because we ordered the mussels again and the three of us polished those off quickly, not leaving a whole lot of room for the main dish.  I had the Fettucini, which was creamy and full of flavour.  I can't wait to go back!  Maybe next weekend, after Thanksgiving."}
