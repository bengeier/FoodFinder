{"text":"Food came too quick, meatballs were still cold inside, jambalaya wasnt quite hot.  They forgot to ring in the appetizer  Service was ok, nothing more.  It was pasta tuesday, moderatly busy.  I like the deal on tuesday so we keep coming here hoping for improvement, so far it hasnt happened."}
{"text":"My penne was swimming in cream when it was no supposed to be. No pesto flavour to be had as it was pesto penne advertised, mushroom was so thinly sliced could not even taste it in all that cream, no flavour at all. The waitress did not seem interested to help me out here, she was 'sorry'. No happy hour, no half litre of wine - skip this location!"}
{"text":"Pros: Buger, side of fries, take out staff, free wi-fi
Cons: None this time

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Maybe

On Wednesday around 7:30pm, I went to the restaurant to get my food to go and have my dinner on another place. The cashier was very quick and nice to take my order and at this time there were no line to place my order there.

After paid, there is a place that you can sit to wait for your food to be ready. I waited more or less 15/20 minutes for everything to be done. While I was waiting, I was using the free Wi-Fi to check my e-mails and read the news.

Overall, the fries were dry but tasteful. They were not greased or unseasoned and the burger at a first sight seemed dry what is a bad sign most of the times. But I was wrong, even not juicy inside the burger was delicious. They found the right balance between juicy and dry. I liked this restaurant a lot and I'm looking forward to go back there again."}
{"text":"Most unimpressed and through with this restaurant, this site needs to allow zero stars. Had a gift certificate and with the novelty valentines heart shaped pizzas you can't go wrong right - wrong, sorrily wrong! Walked in and 5 girls were behind the hostess desk and we had to wait several minutes for 1 of them to acknowledge our presence. We were seated at a booth which was really nice and the restaurant seemed dark and needed a little more lighting and this was at 4 in the afternoon, the restaurant was steady, not quiet and not busy either. We were seated at our table and barely opened our menus and the waitress comes by to take our order - seriously - you take your time acknowledging us coming in the front door but want us to know what we want to eat when we've merely opened the menu!? We ordered our drinks and mine tasted like soda water not 7up, I sent it back and settled for water. The girl came back 2 minutes later and asked us what we wanted to order, we had barely found the page in the menu for the pizza selection and their selection isn't half what it was a few years back. Then she comes back 2 minutes later and asks us again at least by this time we had decided on the appetizer and decide to go with the bacon wrapped steak skewers. It comes to our table 2 minutes later, that sure was fast. So I select 1 and cut it open - OMFG! Not only was it medium or rare it was Blue Rare and the bacon was entirely Raw! So that girl takes it back to get it cooked properly. 2 minutes later we have the shift supervisor at our table apologizing saying it was undercooked, ya think!!!??? this was not medium steak people this was Blue Rare!!!! Yuuuuccccckkkkk!!! Afraid to eat any more meat here we decide to split a salad instead, you can't possibly go wrong with a simple salad can you. 2 minutes later our salad comes and it was alright. Then our pizza came in the middle of eating our salads and didn't even remotely resemble a heart, it just looked like a piece was removed from the centre top. She brought our plates out for the pizza just before the pizza arrived and all the plates on our table looked so or out and old and stained and chipped and in addition 1 of them was dirty!! The server wasn't busy, was bugging us every 2 minute and can't check to see if a plate is dirty or clean before placing it in front of a customer about to eat off of it!!!??? We ate half the pizza and decided to take the rest home, so the girl brings up a box to box it up ourselves and then the side dipping sauce I wanted to take home as well and had to ask for a container for that as well and she brought it, but by this time had no utensils at our table to scoop the dipping sauce into the container and she had to then get that for us as well. Seriously?! During the course of our meal our server was at our table every 2 minutes wanting to top up my water, no thank you! I don't want a server at my table every 2 bloody minutes!! I used to eat here regularly but the menu selection and service has gone so down hill I'm not going back, I'll sooner sell a free gift card to someone else than eat here again, I'm through!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat on the strip. Everything on their menu is delicious, especially their chicken fingers. Great people and great food, how much better can it get?"}
{"text":"Its hit and miss with the service went to the Chinook center location again tonight with some Friends. Brutal service. and barley any sauce in the pasta I had. Cleanliness Id have to say alright I suppose."}
{"text":"Come-on! What a joke. The service was some of the worst I have ever encountered. From the wait staff and the manager. 

My boyfriend and I are one of three tables in the whole restaurant. 
10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our existence.
Our drinks come, we order: An appetizer, A pasta dish and A pizza dish.
10 minutes later, our waitress comes by to inform us that they are out of the appetizer we ordered. We are given a menu to pick a new item, along with a very pathetic and half -assed apology. 
Another 10 minutes go by before our waitress reappears in the dining room to ask us our new appetizer order. (Where on earth she was for 10 minutes is a mystery.) At this point, we express our annoyance that we don't want an appetizer that is going to come out after the meal. 
(Little did we know that the food would take forever). 

The manager brings our food out. That was appreciated until he opens his mouth and gives an awkward sorry and blames the kitchen for not telling them about the appetizer situation. 

My boyfriend eats about 1/3 or his meal then looks at his pasta... it looks like it's missing something. It's a taco or nacho pasta or something. It had never come with the toppings. 
We inform the waitress, who seems stunned and asks us if we want more toppings. 
I try to explain that his dinner never came with the toppings. She still doesn't get it and asks us again if we just want her to get us some \"more\" toppings. 
Annoyed we agree and she brings them out in little containers with lids on them and plops them in front of us with a half-assed sorry. 

We eat our bland, greasy food. Then we wait 15 minutes for our waitress to resurface to ask her for our bill. We pay, we leave.  

My boyfriend contacts the GM of this Boston Pizza location. He gets a response where the GM blames the manager and the waitress for being incompetent and offers us $20.00. 

Maybe I'm a hard audience, but $20.00 for an experience this horrible is insulting.     

Going to stick with Jack Astor's or East Side Mario's, or any other chain restaurant. At least if they screw up THEIR shitty food, they know how to treat their customers with respect."}
{"text":"Se horrible!  I can't believe how cold the fries are! My chicken sandwich had the smallest amount of chicken I've ever seen on a sandwich. The salad was served without sauce. Nichols served were cold with little cheese. I'd skip this one if I were you."}
{"text":"First of all this Boston pizza have relocated to 80 Saddletown Circle NE Calgary, Alberta T3J0H5. I went there last weekend I gotta say service was great but the food was pretty bad. I ordered a medium rare striplion steak it was as hard as a rock and mashed potatoes were bland and had a weird smell. You could use the garlic bread as a door stopper the only good thing about this location was there was football on tv."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Been to other BP and other establishments in the area, we've actually been to the Vaughan BP 4 or 5 time and the service has been bad every time! The last time we went we were seated quickly but no one came to our table for atleast  12 mins to take our drink orders, and man I was thirsty that night. Funny thing is the restaurant wasn't even busy. I won't go back and neither should you."}
{"text":"The decor was amazing! that was my first impression.
the service was great as well. we ordered 1 large pizza with extra cheese and chocolate with hot fudge. ALL OF IT WAS AMAZING. 
I was pleased and would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"My experience at this Boston pizza was good. I went in during a Thursday afternoon and there was no wait time. The service was good and our food came out in 10-15mins after our appetizers. There was nothing wrong with the food it tasted good like it normally does at any other Boston pizza."}
{"text":"Apparently a table of 2 doesn't rate being seated here.  We went after 6:30 on a Sunday evening.  There was nobody waiting.  The hostess told us there were no tables opened, so I asked about an empty booth behind her - it was a booth for 4 people.  The same sized booth beside it had 2 people sitting at it.  Se informed me that they kept that opened in case a table of 6 came in.   6 adults would not comfortably fit in that booth.  

Apparently a group of 2 people don't rate service.  And since they did not care to have our service, they will never get it again.  

One word of advice- a bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.  A that time on a Sunday evening, there may not be any more tables of 6.  

So remember- if you are a group of 2, they obviously don't care if they have your business. I guess they won't make enough money off of you."}
{"text":"Good enough food, but their delivery people leave a lot to be desired. Snotty, sneering teens with bad attitudes and surly manners. Here I am sitting with my arms pull of food and he wants me to sign the slip, I say I cant, so he says \" well give me the damn food back then, duh. \". Sneered and snorted as I put the food down on the floor with no help to sign his slip. You can get the same quality food elsewhere w/out the service with a sneer."}
{"text":"The service is so bad . I called to talk to the manager how about how bad our service has been lately and he was so rude . He told me if you don't like it don't come back . Whist we won't . Wish you could let the owners know . The Manager could care less and the staff are brutal . Maybe the owner should hire new staff . No wonder your reviews are awful ."}
{"text":"Great place as long as you do not deal with Daryl at the entrance. Absolutely rude and unreasonable. Was told to pay, leave and return if I wanted to switch tables when more friends showed up regardless of availability of seating. Shrugged me off and told me to leave if I didn't like the service."}
{"text":"Franchise location. The food is average here, and you would think the pizza would be great, but no, it's passible. Ingredients certainly don't have a fresh taste, and the pasta give you the same feeling. 

Service is friendly enough, and if you are a sports fan, there's always something good on TV. Its not cheap either (Jim take note), but they try to capture a family audience."}
{"text":"Well, this was a bad choice for lunch.. they always stress delivery, so we tried it at work. I paid for each topping on my pizza, and I literally got one peice of ham cut in 4 and 4 slices of green pepper on my pizza. Oh sorry, I didnt mention the red onion that was in the box and not even on my pizza. My collegues fries are cold and they gave her next to none.

safe to say this will the last time we order from there.."}
{"text":"I was there and asked for the pesto pasta it was so bad they changed it for me and it was worse 
 I will never ever go there again , I couldn't eat it and gave it back to them and they said  we are sorry and they charged me for it and I didn't eat it 
Now im telling them im sooorry for my review but that is the troth."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars for a multiple of reasons. The pizza is delicious and the pricing is great. The people that work there are very nice and the wait time is minimal. It loses a half a star due to the ambiance. There is none, lol. Personally I wouldn't want to dine in (because it's kinda old and depressing) so i get it to go. So if you want a great pizza, late at night, for a great price, get it to go."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! We have been to his location before and enjoyed the food, so with not feeling well today, my husband and I ordered take out. BIG MISTAKE! My pasta was horrrrrrrribleeeeeee.  And also, if your pasta IS portioned - then you guys need smaller pasta take out containers... My container looked ridiculously low with maybe about 7 ravioli? Not sure what's going on at this location, but I sure hope someone reads these help reviews as I will never be returning again, and two customers have been lost."}
{"text":"Second time here, now the last time. The service is horrid, assuming you get some.  The food is typical BP fair but poorly prepared and slow.  You'd expect more from this chain but they are really letting this location slide.

I don't normally review chains, but this one is bad enough that something should be said."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online, and the food we did get was pretty good, if not very warm. Was told 45 min for delivery though, and it took 1.5 hours and the food had cooled a lot. The drive between my house and this location is about 10 min. Maybe 15 if you take the long way, but that's pushing it. Was told when I called to find out where my food was that the driver had headed out to make 2 deliveries. Even if we were the second delivery it's ridiculous. And I didn't get my garlic toast with my fettuccini Alfredo. I remember seeing the option to upgrade to cheese toast, or something else, so I know it was supposed to be there. Won't be ordering delivery again."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Our first date ended up here and now we go there for special occasions.  Excellent salads and pizza.  Once something didn't go right and that went way out of their way to make it right!"}
{"text":"i would say \"meh .. not the sharpest tool in the drawer' had to go a few times with group of people and most of them selected it for its location. I would go again if there is no other choice"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and even better service! My family and I go there all the time especially on weekends. I also love their lunch specials"}
{"text":"It's always super busy here especially dinner and late-night dinner so be aware of that. I personally love the variety of food choices they have here. I have ordered the shrimp pasta and sriracha pizza and absolutely loved both! The prices can be a little expensive but the portion are pretty big (I always have to take half of my food home) The service are okay. You may get a good service or may not but overall they dont seem to bother you that much so its okay. Food never comes on time though.. they always take at least half an hour to serve."}
{"text":"A nice place to visit once in a while. Staff is friendly, warm environment(lounge & restaurant), and not too costly. Food is allright and the wait isn't too long."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a couple of times and I have had nothing but great service here. I always ask for Ivy, because she knows the menu from the back of her head. She is very friendly and polite. I always see her checking on her tables to make sure all her diners are ok. 

The food is ok, it's not the best but it is not the worst. Can't really expect much from chain restaurants since a majority of it is frozen. I have been getting the same pasta every time I visit and the pasta is always inconsistent. The pizza is pretty good though and the desserts. Especially the brownie!

You guys should totally ask for Ivy when you visit."}
{"text":"I came here again bc my nephew & I use the bike trail nearby & it's on the way home.  He has this thing for their 'Double Bacon BBQ Burger' which is a ridiculous $12.99.  I had a bite.  Meh, I could make better.  I had the 'Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich' which was $12,95 with their Caesar salad which was $22.00 or so altogether.   Way, way over-priced.  The service was slow which isn't a lot of fun with a minor.  We've both always loved their fries which is ironic bc I'm not spending this kind of money again.  Wendy's is right across the street & they have the 'Baconator' & Frosy's.  my nephew's getting old enough to see that just bc something costs more doesn't mean it's better."}
{"text":"Normally I love Boston Pizza! they've got fantastic choices of food and i've never been disappointed by their food or drinks. I've dined at numerous locations in the GTA so I think its safe to say I have a good impression of them. Except for this Boston pizza at the Yonge and Eglinton location. I went with 3 other friends on a Saturday night. They weren't too busy and seated us quick (it was still early 6pm). I ordered my usual Caesar (the drink) and expected it to be the same size as every single Boston Pizza i've been to, a tall glass (comparable to a pint) garnished with a celery stick. Nope instead i received a small short glass (think short glass of whisky) and no celery.  I always order their extreme caesar or bp caesar from all locations and they have always been the same so when this came I was like what is this??? Now on the drinks menu it says garnished with celery stick so when i called the waitress over and asked about the size of my drink and where my celery was, she lied through her teeth saying their location never served it with celery. I grab the drinks menu read it to her and she still says to me they don't serve it with celery.  Then i show her a picture of me holding a bp caesar with a friend that i took the weekend before, in a large tall glass with the celery she had nothing to say. She kissed her teeth and asked if all i wanted was a celery stick and she will go to the kitchen to grab me one. I was like are u for real? Mind u I ended up returning the drink since i never even touched it and didnt bother putting up a fuss as i didnt want her to mess with our food.

Needless to say we have never been back to this location. Yonge and Eglinton... I know stuff is overpriced in the area but when the Front street and other locations downtown Toronto aren't cheaping out the way you are, you need to realize you are fully ripping off your customers. Either that are stop hiring bimbos who get caught in a lie and get spiffy with their customers."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they were having an off day, but the service was horrible, the wait staff seemed disinterested, the food was cold and unappetizing and I would never recommend anyone go to this location..."}
{"text":"Food came out burned and with some hair strands. My wife ordered a salad and added a $4.99 salmon filet. When the salad came out, it had like the tiniest piece of burned salmon and we ended up paying like around $18 for it. 

The pizza is Ok, not great."}
{"text":"A pleasant enough experience with welcoming staff. Service was proficient and everything we ordered came out hot and fresh, and very tasty too. Food is not gourmet or fancy but portion sizes were pretty good and came out quickly and were as exactly as described on menu. Pizza here is also way healthier (thin crust & crunchier) than compared to their neighbor Pizza Hut as they use fresh vegetables and less oil and grease. Most impressive was the care and attention paid to us by our waitress (super cute and friendly). It was a good meal! (:"}
{"text":"This place sucks, I'm over 1 hour waiting for a table to seat, the place is has 4 empty table but no one cleaned those table for us. If you don't wanna to be fooled by terrible staff just go to another place."}
{"text":"Love their Viva Italia pizza. Sing up for my bp and you get free dessert on your birthday!  I got ny cheesecake and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Fun, clean and reliable bar/restaurant to watch the hockey game or after you play. Service is fast and friendly on a Tuesday night, beer and daily food specials are always priced very well and I've never had a bad meal yet. Wings, pizza, and salads are awesome with the pastas taking a notable second place. Portion sizes are never disappointing and we've never had to send back a meal. Solid B+ joint and always a go to choice!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place on New Years and it was great! Everyone at my party thought it was a hit!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the pizza here.  Not the best but quite good. My wife really enjoys the nachos and cheesey garlic bread. They offer free refills on soft drinks. The staff is friendly and attentive. Service could be faster. It can also be on the pricey side for a place that feels more like a McDonald's or a Wendy's type vibe, if a litlle nicer.  An average meal for us there with tip run 50-60 dollars and that's with no 2 people and maybe 1 drink (not pop) each."}
{"text":"Pizza is just not good..little sauce one pepperoni per slice. It is greasy and over priced. The fries and gyro are okay...but i mainly came for some decent pizza"}
{"text":"I had a quick lunch here. I ordered the chicken quesadilla. It wasn't bad, but I thought it was a little light on the filling. The service was good though. All in all, it's not a bad place for lunch when you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I really didn't enjoy dinner at this BP's. The experience and food was underwhelming. It started with a long wait to be seated (there were lots of empty tables) and ended with incorrect billing. We started with the always tasty Bandera Pizza Bread and asked for a marinara dipping sauce. But instead of telling us that they didn't have marinara, they tried to slip us a bolognese sauce that tasted more like Chef Boyardee. Did they think we wouldn't notice? After that, I had the Ciabatta Chicken Sandwich (grilled chicken breast, tomato, lettuce & roasted garlic mayo on a toasted ciabatta bun). Sadly, while it was well made, this really is a flavourless sandwich. Perhaps marinading the chicken first would improve it? Overall, this Boston Pizza fell flat. The only saving grace to this evening was that our server was quite nice."}
{"text":"Horrible service, terrible arrangement of TVs and tables. We had a giant tv blinding us with children's shows right next to our heads. my husband got to eat his meal before we got our appetizer, and my meal. Just a total mess. Food is horribly overpriced."}
{"text":"This place almost never disappoints! The food quality is consistent and usually pretty good, although I'd recommend refraining from ordering their sandwich items. The service here can vary, depending on how busy it is."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving! This is a hole in the wall place but the food is Amazing!!! Best Philly steak in town!"}
{"text":"Bartender didn't acknowledge me when I joined my bf. had to wave him down which I HATE. Then told me I couldn't order what I wanted ."}
{"text":"For the fourth or fifth visit, they have screwed up the same order.  The staff member today seemed to forget that her job is to serve the public... she almost seemed like we were interrupting her day.  I think I have shoes older than the manager that was working today. My toddler can't eat tomato or tomato products, so I asked for some ranch to dip his fries.  They actually charged me $2 for ranch dressing!!!  I could walk over to the Safeway next door and get a full bottle for less.  I go there for the kid friendly environment but shake my head every time I go in there.  And don't even get me started on the $6 for delivery!!!"}
{"text":"Best buffalo wings in town!! I've been a customer for over 10 years!! I love this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Came quickly, servers were great. I'll be returning again :) 
Had the 10oz Striploin steak and it was medium rare as asked"}
{"text":"After a crazy but fun day of shoving and sweating at the Toronto Aquarium, our hungry party of eight (four adults, four children) ended up in BP right in across from of the CN tower atrium. We have patronized BP in different places, and the experience was always really good. This one was certainly not.

We waited for about 10 min (after telling us that it'd be a 25 min wait). The restaurant was not even half full. Our waiter, however, took a long time to show up and ask for the drinks order. We were already hungry and annoyed about the wait, so we ordered drinks. After we got the drinks, we had to wait over 15 min, with our waiter being MOA. 

Only after we asked to see the manager, who mildly apologise for the wait, attributing it to being short staffed, and also because they did not expect \"so many people\" to come that day (a Saturday? in Downtown TO? In the middle of Christmas break? Hellooo?) we were giving free refills for the drinks and our not so eager waiter finally took our order. Then, another 25 minutes to finally get our lukewarm to cold food. Meaning that our slothful waiter probably left our entire order sit for a good while at the pickup window.

The quality of the food was definitely subpar for BP standards. Not to mention the fact that it was cold, the quality and taste of the food was not good at all.

This is one Boston Pizza that we will not be returning to! You have been warned."}
{"text":"Hours say open til 4am... but don't try and order anything past 315am. They will let the phone ring and ring and ring cuz they don't want to make anymore  pizzas. I order a pizza at 3am and when I arrived to the store(320am) the doors were locked. So I called , heard the phone ringing in the background and nothing. Had to bang on the window to let me in and eat... and once I was in the phone was ringing and ringing and ringing... they didn't pick up one call past 315am... at least change the time if you're going to do that."}
{"text":"I just got a pizza delivered (rustic italian - my favourite out of any chain pizza place) but am surprised by the rating and service complaints at this location. Maybe I think this is a better one because it surpasses the Chinook location with leaps and bounds. The wings on wing night at this location are always crispy and hot. 
The waitress that I get when I go in once a month or so remembers I drink dark rum and coke, and my friend has a soda water with lime wedge. For only the occasional diner, that's pretty damn good. 
If you're looking for a sports bar with good eats, I recommend this BPs, if you're looking for amazing pizza on the cheaper end of the spectrum, there are plenty of independent pizza joints - some with real fornos - in town.
Apparently if you sign up for their website you get a free bandera bread on first your online order. I think that might be their version of crazy bread. I have to say - I did not redeem the offer, if its like crazy bread, it would have ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with the man as we were out and bout running errands. Low and behold it was pasta night!  So the over priced pasta was actaully on for a more resonable wallet friendly deal.

We were seated promtly and told our waitress would come over shortly. We ordered our drinks and looked over the menu. The dining room was fairly empty with only a handful of tables taken. Not sure how busy the louge side was but we were informed that the bartender was slammed and it would be a bit longer for our drinks. Ok not a problem so we ordered. We wanted teh sticky ribs to start as that was a feature item and though hey way not try something different. We weren't sure as to which flavor we wanted to try and asked the waitress for her opinion. Well that was a miss as it seemed like she had never tryed any of the flavors. So  we went with jack daniels bbq flavor. When the rib came out they looked pretty decent. What looked like a tastey bite of meat was none other then a almost flavorless hunk of meat on a bone. OHHHH and to make matters worse the side plates we recieved still had someone elses hunk of meat on it.... super sad face :( 

The bacon chipotle penne was aveage nothing  award winning. When it came out they either forgot my garlic bread or didn't time it right as i got my pasta dish and was told to start on that while my garlic bread was on the way. I'm thinking maybe there was a lot of new people working that day. 

Overall it was a meal that filled me up but I knew going it won't be memorable."}
{"text":"I love going to Boston pizza airdrie, especially on Tuesdays pasta night. I go Tuesdays because its affordable and the food is great. Its fresh always. The steak bites are phenomenal. Ive had them elsewhere and they are not the same as BPs. And for burgers...I have to say i always order a pizza burger for pick up on my way home when I know im not cooking. Sometimes there's a awesome pickle on top, sometimes there isn't. I wish they would be more consistent with it cause it really tops off the burger. I also wish it was just a little more affordable."}
{"text":"Oh BP's, how I loathe thee... can I count the ways??"}
{"text":"Was craving wings after work... not sure what brought me to Boston pizza for that... oh wait,  it was the traffic on major Mackenzie.  The traffic light was green and I was not moving forward so,  decided to turn right and enter the Boston pizza plaza. 

Ordered a single order of fried wings ($12.42) with the chipotle bbq sauce.   Sauce was pretty sweet,  didn't really expect that.   I was hoping or I thought chipotle had a little kick to it.   It tasted more like the wings were baked instead of fried too.  It didn't have the crispy skin you would expect when things are fried. 

I also thought an order of wings (for $10.99 before tax)  will get you at least 10... surprised to find only 8.  And 6 of them were drum stick.  

Wings were so so. .. I don't think I will order wings from Boston pizza again."}
{"text":"we had pesta and don't really like the food there..
no taste at all... not going back"}
{"text":"I had the most wonderful experience last night! Finally a place that actually deserves the tips that we all feel so obligated to give in Canada. Actually, the waitress went above and beyond what 99% of waitresses or waiters will do in almost any restaurant in the world that this cheap a**hole actually tipped more than 20%.
The waitress, Julie I believe, did two things right.

1. She was usually around frequently enough so that you could order on a whim, but not consistently engaged as to become a hindrance. 
2.she brought refills on water without being asked, and almost always right after I finished my cup. Typically I consume a lot of water, last night I believe I ended up having 6 cups and every single time she came by with a fresh cup within seconds of me finishing one. It blew my mind that I would receive that level of service anywhere in Canada

Prices are fair too! 2 shot cocktails were roughly 10$ which is very good for drinking outside of ones home. The deserts were amazing. The panookie was awesome, freshly baked cookie(or warmed) in a giant pan with ice cream on top, drizzled with chocolate syrup!"}
{"text":"We have dined in this location many times. Some good and some bad meals. Last night was fair at best. At least for me. We had the nachos which were good. They returned to the old fashioned nachos with tomatoes, green peppers, onions and olives. I had the Tuscan pizza but with regular chicken not the spicy. Very bland taste . Aside from the chicken on the pizza the rest was tasteless. Way too much cheese and no spices. Would not order again .I ate it because  I was famished. I ordered  the adult chicken fingers and fries for my son and it came with 5 pieces of chicken but only a handful of fries. Very skimpy. I asked the waitress if they changed the portion size. She said no but they did as I always order this meal for my son. The waitress 'Michelle' was kind enough to bring more fries without me asking. She was the only bright spot in this night out. She remembered us from a previous visit and knew what the kids wanted to order. She was wonderful."}
{"text":"We ordered for takeout and purchased a large Caesar salad and a spinach dip. The Caesar salads portion was great but it didn't come assembled. 7 different compartments to open and add to make the salad. The spinach dip was awful, lacked spinach, was very watery and overall visually unappealing. The container it came in was also only a quarter full so the portion was horrible. The chips were extremely stale but the pita was good. Overall, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We love this BP's and it has become our neighbourhood favorite! It's usually one of the places to be on a Friday or Saturday night! Crowd ages range from 25-55 usually. 

They always have good drink specials. Jagers on sale on Saturdays! The food is always good! We live to share the Thai chicken bites when we aren't starving. If not, the perogy pizza is my fave! 

Ally, the server/bartender on the lounge side is hilarious, funny, and great at her job! She us one of the main reasons we keep coming back! If anything hoes wrong, she is quick to fix it and make sure we leave happy. Honestly, they sometimes need an extra body there on busy Friday and Saturday nights. I have watched her juggle 15 tables of 40+ people and rarely pissed anyone off. 

Lots to do here. Buzz time, pool tables, golden tee, vlt's. You can definitely stay busy here. :)"}

Absolutely loved the nachos which are mine favourite and pizza.
Boston pizza have a quite nice selection of drinks."}
{"text":"First time reviewer. I don't mind the food here, its usually pretty good however the customer service is horrible. We ordered a deluxe medium pizza, however the pizza was missing pepperoni after waiting 30 minutes. After advising the waitress, she said she would have another one made, and we can keep the one already done as we are hungry. The waitress then came back and said the manager wants to see the pizza as he does not believe that it is missing the pepperoni, we said okay. The waitress then came back and said she has to keep the pizza otherwise the manager said we will be charged for both. Now we would have been fine giving back the pizza, however the manager should have come out and spoke to us yourself, an apology goes a long way. 1 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Unlike most of the comments here, I'm not going to find fault in the food or the prices of this place. I sat down knowing how much I could be spending and the quality of food I was going to get. I have no complaints there. What I do find incredibly disappoint and aggravating was the HORRIBLE customer service and lack of effort this specific location put into resolving the issue. 

First of all, I understand some customers can be tough and all that but when you, the business are at fault, you do not put that on the customer. It is as simple as that. 

I walk in during a Saturday to what looked like a 'fight night' and for some reason did not find a hostess at the front. Thinking they might be at the other side of the restaurant (where the mall entrance is located) we walk over and there still is no one so we are forced to search for a waitress and seat ourselves. As I was getting up to use the restrooms, I'm stopped by one waitress (this will be the first of many) explaining to me that there was a $5 cover charge per person for the fight.

Fair enough, I've been here before on a fight night and paid that $5 but I explained to her we were just here to eat and it was no trouble at all if we left because we had no interest in watching the fight. She turned to her manager who was standing adjacent to her, asked if it was cool if they waived it and he nodded and the waitress said it was okay that we sit. 

Our server shows up after a few minutes explaining to us that we have to pay a $5 cover and I explained to her the conversation I had with waitress #1 about our cover. Waitress #2 kept asking me if I was sure that the manager said he would waive our cover and I kept saying yes yes yes. I explained to her that I spoke to one waitress and she turned to look at her manager and he nodded. Waitress #2 proceeded to say that it probably couldn't have happened because the manager on duty was deaf. So naturally I felt like I was being called a liar when I had no initial idea. 

She said okay, took our orders and walked away. At this point, waitress #3 came to us and explained how there was nothing they could do about the cover and that there was nothing the manager could do. I so kindly explained that we would not have sat down if we had to pay the cover. She acknowledged that and continued to say that none of the servers nor the manager could do anything about it. 

I continued to explain that because of their miscommunication, I had to suffer and funny enough waitress #3 had no idea about our situation. She in fact thought we had just finished and didn't want to pay the cover. I told her that if she had communicate with waitress #1 and #2 she would know that we just sat down, were told that the cover would be waived and that it was okay with the second waitress who had taken our order minutes before this. 

The lack of communication between all these waitresses was enough to throw me off the edge and I'll be honest, i was not happy at this point. Waitress #3 returns to tell us that no one in the restaurant can do anything about our situation including the manager. I suggested that because it was their initial fault, they should waive a meal or something like that but for some reason, I got the exact same answer. So by the looks of it, even the managers have no authority or power at this restaurant.

She left and returned again with a couple, 'free soft drink' coupons and suggested we use them right away to compensate the cost of cover which didn't really seem like much of a compensation at that point. 

Once again she left and returned again. At this point if I was being forced to pay cover to watch a fight I might as well watch it but I felt like I was paying cover to argue with every waitress in the restaurant. 

We finally told them that we did not care and that for $15 among 3 people wasn't a problem. It's the fact that no one in the restaurant could resolve a simple issue. Sure at the beginning if they had said we cannot sit if we dont pay, we would've come back another time but with all this arguing and miscommunication, they lost 3 customers over $15. 

After some time, waitress #4 showed up explaining that they could do nothing even after they had spoken to the GM. I was infuriated after hearing that because this whole time we had been dealing with servers and the only manager around was one that could not communicate with us. Now she tells me the GM was in and the reason he could not speak to us was because he was, and I quote word for word, 'in and out for smokes'. Okay, so that's not going to help the situation at all.. I told her to tell him to speak to us after. She said he couldn't because he was, and again I quote, 'intoxicated'. WHAT A HORRIBLE REPRESENTATION OF A FRANCHISE. All of this turned into a joke after I was told that. There was no point of getting angry because this whole this was silly and it was clear that this location had nothing going for it."}

{"text":"It's closed! I hope it reopens soon. The food is typical chain restaurant food, don't expect much. Unless you really enjoy chain restaurant food in which case your in luck. This might be the best Boston Pizza location out there because of their incredible patio out back. Other wise it's really just good for their yummy frozen cocktails on their patio. Don't expect to get too much sun back there though."}
{"text":"Let's examine what I do like first about Boston Pizza. The service has always been nothing short of impeccable on each and every occasion. I have eaten and thoroughly enjoyed many a fabulous pasta dish, salad, and burger. I even feel like I have received value for my money. However, when it comes to pizza, Boston Pizza does not deliver (in quality that is).

Although a superficial animosity exists between Torontonians and those from Western Canada, one thing someone from TO does know is the experience of good pizza. A firm crust with fluffy egde due to the right mixture of flour, yeast, water, and oil, light cheese rather than piled on and cheddar never in a million years, the toppings properly cooked, and ingredients that stay on the pizza when you eat rather than falling in your lap. All cheese is underneath the toppings.

The crust was reminiscent of sixties vintage frozen pizza or the Kraft mixes of the same era, namely hard as a rock and torture to the gums. The taste was doughy and yeasty, not even remotely Italian in style, flavour nor texture. The cheese was just heaped, so much so that I could not taste the toppings. The toppings were not fully cooked and as a result did not carmelize leaving them essentially tasteless. The ingredients fell off of the pizza with each bite.

They offer a \"Rustic Italian Pizza\". I have made my views known about the crust already, abominable and not Italian. They smother it with Cheddar cheese. Cheddar is an English cheese, not Italian. While in Italy I never saw anything but Italian cheeses on pizza. I felt like I was eating an open faced English grilled cheese sandwich not a pizza.

There is no reason not to eat at Boston Pizza but several reasons not to order pizza. Stick to the burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and salads and you will be most satisfied with what you are eating. If you are looking for an Italian style pizza, this is the last place you want to eat - for that matter, if you are looking for pizza period, a most disappointing experience.

Rename the restaurant chain to Boston Bistro, it would be more appropriate. When the word \"pizza\" is in the business name, one should expect that they would understand how to make a good pizza. Like I stated, this place does not deliver."}
{"text":"First time I enjoyed Boston pizza.  Visited with hockey team, staff super accommodating and well organized. Had shrimp tacos they were great.  Service fantastic."}
{"text":"I give Two Stars, because they are below average for what they pose.
Forgot the gravvy which I ordered, food was late in take out,
food taste was not worth for the price paid."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and pizza for delivery. They got busy. Pizza arrived within a reasonable amount of time, but it and the wings & onion rings were all cold. I called and they offered to make it fresh again.

I think a lot of the negative reviews about customer service are simply written by impolite people. You don't have to have worked in food services to understand that things happen. It takes a good business and quality employees to make me write anything on yelp.

One could be angry that they were delivered cold food or they could not just assume that the workers didn't give a ****. What if the customer really just wants to eat regardless of temp and would be more pissed at you making things fresh and taking longer than just delivering things at room temp? Sure, they could call and check but then they're admitting fault and taking time on an order that should already be set while dealing with a large wave of customers. Every impatient person is already irritated. Every patient customer feels taken advantage of.

The RIGHT way to do customer service in this situation was to do exactly as they did. Deliver as soon as they can and if the food isn't up to par, making good on your purchase by offering fresh food or your money back and an apology.

Realistic people really can't ask for more without asking for too much. All the rest of you should chill."}
{"text":"Horrible! Food arrive sporadically with all the kids meals arriving at least 10 minutes after the at adults. Pizza was cold and all of the sauces had a thick layer of film on them like they'd been sitting out all week. Gross! Servers were rude and incompetent, missed 2 of our food orders and then insisted we ordered something we didn't and asked us twice if we were sure we hadn't ordered it. When desserts arrived they were all dumped at the end of the table and the server told us he was too busy and we needed to figure them out ourselves. On our way out there was a line of 3 or 4 people waiting to speak to the manager because they had problems with their bills. This location has been open forever. It's a family pizza restaurant how hard can it be. Maybe it's time to consider closing your doors. Yelp won't let me post this review without giving at least one star so I did, but they definitely don't deserve it."}
{"text":"We got the spicy perogy and a prime rib while our 2 year old got his favorite bugs and cheese pasta.

The Perogy burger was really good, the missus kept talking about it a few days after the meal. The Prime rib burger was meh. I should have known better since we have tried a lot on their menu and I could not remember why I did not order this in the past.

The kid loves his pasta, I only wish the portion was a little more.

One thing to point out during this visit was that the soda we ordered tasted like it was lying out for hours - no fizz or chill, we had to send it back and the server did not seem to like that we did that."}
{"text":"After eating here I came down with ecoli poisoning. They did not cook the chicken through and both my friend and I were sick for weeks."}
{"text":"Granted I have been here in a while, but this was one of my favorite places to eat for wings. They also have one of the best Philly Cheese Steaks in town. Interestingly, I'm not a fan of there pizza, it's not bad, but it ain't going to knock your socks off. But the cheese steak and wings are definitely worth going."}
{"text":"I come to this BP at least once a week and have never been disappointed with food or service. Big Dipper sandwich is awesome!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Boston pizza ever based on service. Worst service ever. If your looking for a place to sit, there's plenty of seats. Just plan on hanging around, because it will take at least a half hour before anyone gets to you, and half hour intervals until someone will be back. Maybe now I know why there's plenty of seats. Thanks for the waste of time you D Bags!"}
{"text":"SERVICE: Very, very slow delivery (55 min within 1/2 mile radio) The lady on the phone was not necessarily rude, but very dry... Not even a thank you after the conversation... Bad overall 
THE PIZZA: very, very cheese, i guess its good. Great crust flavor, crisp edges. Good when compared to the others in the area. I might consider doing business again, but either for pick up or dine in, and hopefully get treated better face to face."}
{"text":"After experiencing phenomenal service at the Dalhousie Boston Pizza, I assumed the same would go for this location at CrossIron. My friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat in the sports bar/lounge area before catching our 7:30pm movie. Our service wasn't too bad until our food came out which was served by a younger girl, lets call her C (I won't mention her full name on here..yes I caught her name from her name tag). I was surprised by how rude she was to my friend and I. She specifically would not make eye contact with me and did not acknowledge my request for the bill. While she was acting like it was a funeral at our table, I watched her leave our table and start acting all giddy while walking towards the seated bar area to talk/flirt with her friend or bf who was seated at the bar...he was not even a paying customer, he was seated there and didn't even buy anything at that too! I think this employee C should be re-trained or she should find a better suited part time job that does not involve serving or customer service, especially since she is horrible at it. In addition, what makes this night worse is I could hear the one girl working in the lounge who was busy actually doing work, she told C to bring the machine over to table 2(where I was seated) and to be \"nice\"....excuse me but when do you need to tell your staff to be nice? Being nice comes with professional customer service...I'm not sure what this girl had against me, perhaps it was due to the colour of my skin, but overall I found the service at this location to be extremely insulting and will not come here again.. nor will I recommend this location to my friends, coworkers, and family. I will definitely stick to going to the Dalhousie location where the staff is friendly and the food is cooked properly."}
{"text":"Slowest, non-existing staff ever!! Have been multiple times and literally can say they are useless. Especially for a dead quiet restaurant! Food is way way way overpriced, never prepared to par (cold pizza!), dinky looking expensive salad! Food comes out super late, servers NEVER around and staff always forget to bring you what you ask for such as crackers, extra sauce etc. I don't get it as it's always quiet on a weekday around lunch when I have gone. I am done going. So glad there is a new restaurant, Pour, that has opened in the area with way better service,  food and beverage. This was always our fall back on restaurant to take my Grandma with my cousins and Aunts. All of us can vouch that we have been disappointed every time we have come, together or not, and will never go back. It's too bad because I have had good experiences in other BPs but this location has ruined all if them for myself and my family."}

{"text":"For a Boston Pizza, this place disappoints me. 

Our first visit was during the NHL playoffs last winter. We stopped in hoping to get a seat in the lounge that was full. Not all the tables were used but there weren't any chairs left. We asked the hostess for more, they said no, that we'd have to sit in the dining room. So we agreed as there aren't many other options in Chestermere. Well, they wouldn't give us their lounge promotions because we weren't in the lounge, even though it wasn't by choice. Then, they wanted to seat us directly underneath a TV so we had no way to watch the game. When we saw the table we asked for a different one, which of course seemed like a ridiculous request to the person. The food was okay but the service wasn't great. 

The next visit to this BP was similar. This time with a group of 5, going to sit in the dining room. The server was on us every minute until we ordered, then she'd brought the food, then it was like we never saw her again. There were 3 tables at this point, on a weekend lunch time. My cheesesteak sandwich was okay, but borderline cold. Someone had also spilled half the jus all over the plate leaving everything a soggy mess.

Disappointing for a BP."}
{"text":"First time:
Loved it. Sat at the bar before a movie and had some good drinks and a quick snack. They were out of the burgers so they made me the Swiss Mushroom burger but as sliders instead. The service (bartender) was great and the food was good. However, I am constantly disappointed by the beer selection.

Second time:
Not so good. Server was nice but not thorough. She screwed up 1 of our 2 plates of food. We were in a rush so we ate them without saying anything because there was literally no time to wait for them to remake it. I had their 'All-Meat Wings' which I don't understand. They are just chicken breast, aka, boneless chicken \"wings\" you would get anywhere esle. Yet, they advertise as though they were the first to come up with it and say they \"took out the bone and put in more meat\" it's silly and overpriced. They were dry inside and soggy outside - exactly how they would be if they were microwaved. There were also certain items on the plate that made me believe some of them were re-plated. Blech! Later on, we were overtaken by severely upset stomachs. Gross."}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza is like most others, the atmosphere is casual and somewhat dark, with boxing showing on the TVs. We came with two children on their \"Pasta Tuesday\" special. Our kids ordered the mini burger platter and my son ordered the alfredo linguini dish with an extra side of chicken. Both seemed happy with their meals with no complaints. 

However, in ordering our meals, I ordered the mushroom and chicken alfredo fettuccine and my wife ordered the alfredo fettuccine with salmon and baked cheese on top. The speed of service was remarkable in that the meals came out within ten minutes of ordering. However, the area we were sitting in was somewhat cool, and my meal was warm not hot. My wife thought her meal was bland and didn't have much flavour.

The server, whose name started with \"L\", a thin brunette wearing all black with fishnets ripped no doubt from rubbing against tables all shift. She was pleasant and quick and friendly, but although her service was adequate, not enough to bump up a higher score due to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Good ol' Boston Pizza, from one location to the next they never seem to disappoint!

Today I went for wing night with my mom which is a rare occasion since we're usually busy every day but today we had the chance to stop by BP just for their wing night (which was introduced to us by my brother). If you're looking for a new wing night location and day, Boston Pizza's 0.35 wing night is a must try. With only 9 popular flavours there's nothing more you can expect. Their wing night does come with a few rules though such as having a minimum order of 10 wings, drinks purchase for every two order, and no free refills (with the exception of water of course!)

The wait time for the wings was an average 8-10 minutes which is a pretty standard time. BP's wings are traditional - not your standard breaded wings but perfectly deep fried wings covered with your choice of sauce. What I find odd is that you can also add celery sticks for 0.99 and/or ranch for 1.25, why do you think I find it odd? The ranch cost more than the celery. 

I saw a little sign about the dessert burger which is a chocolate fudge bar paired with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel sauce in between two slices of freshly baked sweet bread. Have I got one to try? No not really but looking at the little sign does make me want to try it while supplies last, maybe the next visit I will."}
{"text":"Although this particular location is tucked away in Beddington Blvd NW and Centre St. BP always deliver fast service and great food. 

There's never a time that I had a negative experience with Boston Pizza but I do have a lot of reviews towards the restaurant from different locations so I'll keep this really short.

Boston Pizza's Beddington location is a must and would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I actually agree to what other Yelpers had to say. To sum up my experience: quality of food - 5 stars, service - 1 star, efficiency - 1 star.

The wait time for the food is normal, 10-15 minutes depending on what you order and how busy they are. The severs doesn't even check up on you only when you asked for the bill. Not even for a refill. They'll pass your table countless times but won't see if you're doing alright. Won't be surprise if someone starts choking and the server just ignores and pass the table. The food is great though, don't get me wrong on that!

Boston Pizza is a +1 in my books but there are other locations to choose from. Not feeling like going to other BP locations? No worries, Chinook Centre also offers other eateries such as Chop, Joey, Globefish, and State & Main"}
{"text":"Pros:  Manager did everything she could do make me happy.  

I ordered a pizza for delivery to my hotel on my trip to Vegas.   It was with out a doubt the worst pizza I have ever tried.  The cheese didn't  taste right, the crust was like a soggy bread.  I literally could not eat one slice and pizza is my favorite food.  My thinking has always been that there is no such thing as a terrible pizza.

So I called to tell them and the manager was great.  She said to pick something else and they would bring it by.  I chose the chicken parm grinder and that was also way below standard.  I squeezed the chicken and a lot of bad looking oil came oozing out.   The roll was pretty good.  I ended up just eating that.

Maybe they were having a bad day but based on my experience, beware!

Pizza 0/10
Chicken Parm 2/10
Fries 3/10
Delivery speed 4/10
Manager 10/10  -thanks for trying"}

{"text":"This Boston pizza is alright. The food is usually a long wait, once I have had raw Thai chicken served to me. It was like they put it in the fryer and someone took it out thinking it was done. The service is kinda slow depending on the time of day but the staff keep it pretty clean."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. My son ordered a half rack of ribs and got a few pieces of string on a couple of bones. Nothing like the portion you would get elsewhere. When I showed the manager a photo, her reaction was shock, then she tried to tell us this is the norm, except maybe it would be a bit bigger. No effort to rectify the situation. I think it was pathetic for almost $17."}
{"text":"I went there this past Tuesday and the Friday before. The first time we sat in the bar area. It took our server 10 minutes to greet us. I ordered the pulled pork penne, it tasted below average, microwaved at best, and the sauce tasted store bought, despite all that, he wasn't interested in our best interest when I said it was \"OK\". On Tuesday the server was pointing at us, asking us to order in the order that we were paying in. Then forgot half of our drinks so we didn't get them until our food arrived, our appetizer came after our entree. And we ordered a pizza to go which was never put in system to be prepared. I couldn't believe how horrible the service was and I only went back because I was invited to a birthday dinner, reluctantly. The manager did come over and try to take care of us, which is appreciated. Since I've been in the customer service industry for 10+ years, I know how hard it is to salvage a repeated mess up by an ignorant employee. Regardless, I wouldn't recommend anyone go to this Boston pizza. Unless management hires people who value what they do."}

{"text":"This is a franchise eatery. Do not come here if you want gourmet food.

family friendly. yes.

lots of tvs. playing sports. great for people who want an environment that is filled with stimulus for the young ones - and for the young at heart.

I was cajoled into coming here by a 9 year old. that belongs to my brother. I was dreading the dinner and expecting much worse than what I got.

my brother has some sort of card that lets a kid eat free with an adult entree. I was impressed by this - considering it had no 'day of the week' type restrictions. I am impressed easily by coupons and specials. 

as for the food? 

I had some sort of 'pizza burger'. I was very skeptical that I would like it. I think they made it by wrapping a piece of pepperoni pizza around a bacon burger. 

despite the way that sounds when I re-read it - it actually tasted good!! again - this is not gourmet food - but the prep was very clean in appearance - and the ceasar salad I had as a side tasted as good as any franchise eatery caesar I have ever had. this was a recommendation from a waitress. I am generally impressed when wait staff are capable of making suggestions to fit my palate. 

for franchise food this is good - I would rate it as better than kelseys or montana. While that is not exactly high praise - that is the ball park of what you get here.

I am not saying this is the best burger i have ever had - if you want a burger go to a burger place. 

But if you come here and aren't wanting the pizza, pasta or salad that they claim they are known for - don't shy away from the burger."}

{"text":"An Ode to Hunger:

A man, traversing the concrete seas, hearkened by a song
Waylaid by a beast of foul nature, thought to be long gone

\"Curse you bitter cravings!\" I cried. \"You treat me oh so ill! 
If you had but form I'd slay thee well! And you'd be a worthy kill\"

Poor temperament my hunger caused, when a hat-of-ass appeared
He swerved in front of my vessel, and I nearly impacted him arears

\"Another evil villain I would put you in your place
Should you chance upon me elsewhere I would long to punch your face\"
This hunger it's a deadly thing that disposes me to violence
When all I truly wish for is a peaceful bit of silence\"

And there! Over yonder swells, I see the red and blue! 
An island made of pizza, pasta, sandwiches and brews!
I knew that making landfall was my best and only option
My appetite necessitated that I stop with little caution

I entered this blessed haven, and uttered the basest of behests
\"Bring me quenching ales, for I'm traveling deep into the west\"
The servant brought the pints and a pizza quickly after
\"These victuals are the tits!\" I cried, bellowing with laughter

The servant soon returned with a slip of paper marked with runes
\"Thank you sir, you've had your fill; Now I need your doubloons\"
Carefully I read the sum: I couldn't believe mine eyes
The total was entirely reasonable and my pocketbook should survive

With the monster in my belly sated, it was time to resume the quest
Onward, HMS Hyundai Accent, may your voyage be the best
And should the monster reappear, we'll vanquish him fo sheez

Je vais commencer par les points positifs : nous avons reçu notre commande en 25 minutes, un soir de match de hockey.

Points négatifs : 

1) J'ai commandé l'assiette de brochettes de poulet. Mon poulet n'était pas bien cuit, rose à l'intérieur.

2) mon copain a pris les pâtes avec saucisse, poulet et crevettes. L'assiette était supposée être épicée, elle ne l'était pas. Elle était plutôt sans goût au fait.

3) le pain à l'ail qui accompagne les pâtes était brûlé, et la mauvaise vinaigrette a été mis sur la salade, et ce malgré le fait que la commande s'est fait en ligne (donc info écrite de façon claire)

4) mon assiette de poulet viens normalement avec deux accompagnements: riz et légumes. Aucun ne m'a été livré. Oui, j'ai reçu deux brochettes seulement. J'ai appelé le resto. Ils m'ont dit qu'ils m'enverrai ce qui manque dans qques minutes. Le livreur est arrivée en environ 10 minutes (point positif) mais avec seulement les légumes en main... J'ai rappelé le resto pour me faire dire que la seule chose qu'on pouvait m'offrir c'est un crédit pour la prochaine commande (comme si j'allais vouloir recommander...). Mon copain lui a expliqué que ça ne réglait pas le problème qu'il nous manquait une partie de notre souper, et on s'est fait répondre qu'ils étaient trop occupés avec les autres clients pour pouvoir nous envoyer le reste de notre commande. Nous avons demandé de parler au gérant, et après s'être fait refusé la requête cinq fois, on a pu lui parler. On est resté poli, après tout ce n'est pas sa faute. Il s'est excusé, et nous a dit que le riz arrivera d'ici trente minutes. Malheureusement, le riz ne s'est jamais fait livré.

Quelle catastrophe de resto...."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but it's more than that here!  We come here and always end up selecting one of their non-pizza dishes!  Very spacious venue, high ceiling.

We ordered:
-Pizza burger.  
-Wings (8 pieces): pretty satisfying.  Not small.
-Side/appetizer salads are big
-Main salads are huge
-Shrimp tacos (come with 3tacos and a side)
-Salmon entree can get it with mash potatoes, latter side was huge.

Kid friendly.  The kids meal are done well and includes a drink and a big scoop of ice cream.  

Definitely has variety and tastes good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Boston Pizza. My daughter and I order delivery at least 3 nights a week. The delivery guy is the best delivery guy I've ever met. I don't remember his name! But he's awesome, has a mustache and is always wearing cowboy boots. The wings are always on point. I've never tasted fries like theirs. I don't know what they season their hamburger patties with, but their cheeseburgers are out of this world. 
As I sit here waiting for a to go order, I'm amazed at how nice and big this place is. The booths are clean and comfortable. The TVs are nice and big. The door is open and the breeze is nice. The wait isn't long either. I think this is my new favorite place to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lettuce was rusty and had a dead bug in it, chicken sandwich on a pizza bun was so hard it damaged the roof of my mouth. No customer service and was very slow.
Prepare for disappointment!"}
{"text":"I have been to BPs before so thought it would be ok to take some family there who were visiting from the UK.  How embarrassing was that choice.  We were seen to the table by a girl who obviously did not want to be there.  Then the table she sat us at was dirty and so was the floor around the table.  Then to top it all there was food still encrusted on the supposedly clean cutlery.

I asked for clean cutlery and the ones she brought back were worse than the first lot.  We left shortly after this and went to another restaurant.  Worst experience in a restaurant ever.

Have not been in a BPs since."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst dining expierance I have ever had! We went in at 3 pm on a Saturday, the restruant was fairly empty. It took 10 minutes for one of the five staff members to finally notice us, and seat us. We were sat right next to a team party full of loud kids, with a whole restruant of empty tables. After we ordered, it took 40 minutes for our food to get to us. My meal was brought out incorrectly, and had shrimp in it. I have a very severe allergy to shrimp, and was not able to eat any of my meal. You would think you might want to be careful what you try to serve to paying customers. I notified the server of the mix up, and she assured me that my correct meal would be out in five minutes. Twenty minutes later, my party had finished their meals, and mine was still not out. At this point we had been there for an hour and a half. We finally told her to forget it, because we had to leave to make other plans. I never got my meal, and a manager ever came to speak to us, no apology was offered for serving seafood either. I did not eat at botson pizza during this visit, and I will never be visiting again. If you have allergies, you should avoid this place. They clearly do not care for the safety of their patrons."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice unlike the food.  Me and my family when there because we wantes to celebrate a birthday and i ordered a steak for a mid cook which they brought me a mid rare so that annoyed me because the steak cost 25 dollars. As for the pizza \"pizza pizza is way better\"- mother. The chesse was basically raw and under cooked the pizza had little to no flavor. How do yoyu screw up something thats in your name. As for drink dont ever bother to ask for tea. The water was colder then room temp even though we asked for tea not ice tea. I would recommend jack asstors any day compared to this"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant Feb. 8th of this year and I ordered the full rack of ribs.  It was the smallest rack of average tasting ribs I have ever been served.  When I mentioned it to the waitress, I was told that what I had received was actually quite generous in comparison to the norm.  Well folks, I have been told...  And I will not return."}
{"text":"Wow this place is getting some crap ass reviews. Where is the love... Mmmm??... Where is it!!?!?!

I have to admit, I have a soft spot for BP, this location being one of three bars that I can consider my home away from home.

Ok sure, the food is so-so. The service, half the time, is non-existent. The pizza is good.

But all y'alls are missing the point. The only thing that matters about this place, is the schooners.
It is a sin to talk shit about a place that sells beer for this cheap.

If you've never had a $7 (I think it's $7, I don't bother looking at the price anymore) schooner of Canadian before, it might be a good idea to stay away. Because if you are somehow fortunate enough to chug down one of these golden mugs of bliss, everything else in your life would suddenly seem dull, like a documentary about stamp collecting, or raising sea monkeys.
Ok scratch that. Just do it. If you think you're deserving of true happiness, then go and get yourself a BP schooner of Canadian. Order two at a time to be safe.

The other night, I tried the pepperoni and bacon pizza burger. I don't usually eat anything at BP other than the pizza or the quesadilla... Because they're safe. But I was feeling adventurous... and oh my, what a journey it was.

My first impression was that it came in one big round ball of food, whereas the photo in the menu showed two halves of the burger stacked on top of one another, exposing the awesome beefy, cheesy, bacony insides. It didn't look half as appealing as the photo suggested and I was about a French fry width away from chucking this oversized pizza pocket into the server's face who, by the way, was super friendly.

My friends held me back so I just ate the pizza burger. It was cheesy, the hamburger patty was huge and semi moist. I don't think I tasted any beef, though. I don't think I tasted any bacon either. If you like cheese topped with lettuce, tomato and a slice of pickle, wrapped in bread, this one is for you.

So yea, like I was saying, come for the sports, stay for the schooners and pizzas. Do not order anything else... DO NOT!"}
{"text":"Ordered $70 worth of food,  service was good even tho we got here at 330am..  :)  really good definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Poor food quality.  I doubt any actual cooking takes place in the kitchen - the kitchen staff reheats from frozen or deep fries and serves.  As previous reviewer has mentioned - your money is much better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"TWO WORDS: bad service. 

Here's a tip to management: be careful what kind of employees you hire. When there are tons of students looking for work during the summer, you may want to be diligent in screening the candidates. 

Went there today, and it was an absolute joke. The place was running around with staff, but absolutely no service to be had. 

Waited for an unacceptable amount of time before we were seated, and how long did the food take? Well, we didn't stick around to find out, because after waiting close to 40 min for 2 entrees (and with noone to provide an explanation) we decided to get up and walk out. 

A bunch of waitresses running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but didn't see anybody around us getting any food either."}
{"text":"Ordered from here the other day. Overall not terrible, but not outstanding. The crust was good; however, it was just too greasy which equals soggy pizza. The flavor was good and delivery was reasonably fast. Overall, not sure if I will retry or not."}
{"text":"Great service, our waitress was very attentive and nice. I ordered the starter sized nachos and it was enough for two people. It was huge so I had to take half of it with me after not being able to convince my husband to eat the rest. Lots of expensive things on the menu but if you know what to order it can be very budget friendly, not to mention pasta Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"The most horrible boston pizza ever. The service is shit and the food is thrown on a plate and comes out cold. The BP on warden is 1000 times better. The staff ignores you, and when they finally come over it takes forever to get what you asked for. Awful establishment."}
{"text":"Though a little pricey, I can always count on the quality. We often order delivery when we're feeling lazy and the food is always good.

I live right in the core so sometimes parking is hard to find, so once in a while the delivery driver calls and will ask me to meet him at the back door (as he's parked in the alley). I normally don't mind (food in the lobby is pretty much delivered to my door). Regardless, always delivered within the estimated time (often quicker) and always hot."}
{"text":"Just had dinner from here. The ambience is pretty good, and the food is also very nice. I went with my family and ordered the alfredo pasta, I must say it was delicious. The thickness of the sauce was just the way I like it. Also, they have pretty nice desserts options as well."}
{"text":"Terrible service...
I) got my wing order wrong three times
2) didn't bring us napkins
3) no drink refills
4) had to go up to our waitress's booth to get service and then she just disappeared 

Never will I go back there."}
{"text":"Good service but TERRIBLE food. I have eaten here three times now and each time the food got worse and worse. I will not be returning. You will get better food at the McDonalds across the way."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio which was pretty nice, but had really poor quality food and was basically ignored by the staff. Had a better experience eating inside service-wise, but the food is really the shits. Not sure how you can call yourself Boston PIZZA and serve that kind of crappy pizza..."}
{"text":"If it was for the service alone I would've definitely given it a 5 star rating. The food was very disappointing. We usually are a big fan of the wings at BPs but not this time. We also had ordered the balsamic chicken off their $10 menu and again very disappointing. It just tasted like alfredo pasta with undercooked pasta and tiny little pieces of chicken. The only thing that I did enjoy was the Mini caramel Tiramisu."}
{"text":"This BPs stands out as only one of two in the city that offers Flames hockey ticket packages. For the modest sum of $40, you get a ticket to the game, a ride to the game and back, two free glasses of beer (one before the game, one after) and a hell of a good time.
The seats aren't the best, in the 300 section of the Saddledome, but they aren't the worst either. We were at centre ice and high enough to see the plays, even if we couldn't see the scoreboard. It's a fun atmosphere up there and everyone was drinking that famous Saddledome beer and cheering on the Flames. (We went to see them play the Oilers, so there were equal amounts of Oiler fans). But everyone got along, and we had a few laughs at everyone's expense.
We didn't make it back on the bus though, and I figure BPs owes me a beer that I'll be collecting some night when I find myself back at the Heritage location. But it was still a deal and a good time."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst service I've ever had at any Boston Pizza in the country. It's also one of the most unique looking BPs I've been to with an upstairs that overlooks the main bar area. So we thought it would be good. It wasn't.
Not only us, but other customers were forced to keep going up and down the stairs to get our drinks and food. It was ridiculous. The girl would take orders, then disappear for long stretches with no sign of her or the order. We were pretty close to giving up and just leaving when she finally (like 45 minutes) arrived with the food.
I won't be going back there ever again and I only hope the owners fired that girl. She'd be better off with a government job anyway."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go for pizza and wings when we're in Vegas and in the mood for fast food to pig out. I wouldn't recommend this place if ambiance is more important than the food. Me, I prefer tasty food over ambiance. 

I haven't tried their other offerings, but their pizzas are as good as any best places I have been to in Chicago or California. If you like Boston style pizza with crispy crust and a lots of cheese, then you will definitely enjoy this place. This isn't your typical cheese deprived pizza from Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  I hate places that skimp on their cheese and you have to order extra cheese just to get some decent amount. I am willing to pay the extra few bucks to get a quality pizza.

Also, their wings are perfectly cooked to order. A large three topping pizza, 13 wings w/ fries, and a couple of drinks will cost you about $30 before tax."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza? Why not \"*Your Location* Pizza\" HA. That's just a little suggestion for the marketing staff at corporate.

I've never been to Boston but from my experience at Boston Pizza I'm very fond of the local culture.  There is not a better place to grab a pint with the fellas (my uncle and grandpa).  My uncle and grandpa got Budweiser beer pints and I ordered a Manhattan.  Our waitress Emily was a delight and I can tell you TWO things i liked about her ;) haha oh man, I'm just kidding.  I recently went out with Kassandra from Tinder (to the Mandarin) so it doesn't matter if Emily asked for my number I just couldn't betray her like that.  

So let me set the scene for you.  The fellas were out for some booze and grub.  I ordered the butter chicken fettuccine (delish dish).  I practically booked a flight to Boston at the restaurant because I want the AUTHENTIC Boston cuisine not this suburban mimic.  Gramps ordered the nachos and UNCLE DAVE got the pizza burger.  Emily brought our food when UNCLE DAVE was outside smoking a cigarette (imported Marlboros) so I took a few fries off his plate without asking ha ha I hope he doesn't read this.  

The jalapeños on the nachos were SPICY! So spicy that Gramps had to order a few more beer pints.  This is where the evening took a turn.  When Emily leaned over to put down the beer, Gramps face lit up like Jimmy Neutron with a good idea.  He stared at her bosoms and said some very off color remarks.  I guess the Alzheimers kicked in and Gramps began to say that he was leaving my grandma so he could move to Arizona with Emily (no humidity its good for the aches).  My grandmother died in a snowmobiling accident 15 years ago, so this was all pretty shocking. 

Emily was a good sport but when Gramps began making sucking noises, Emily had had enough.  MANAGER STEVE asked us to leave the restaurant and Gramps struggled with this to say the least.  He was offended that Emily did not want an attractive and wealthy man like himself (I guess the pension for a retired construction worker is pretty good).  I think Gramps might have to be put in an assisted living facility. The upside is that we didn't have to pay for our meal.  This was by far the worst half-birthday of my life. Kassandra didn't even send me her kind regards and hasn't even answered my calls since our date at the Mandarin.  I'm worried that she doesn't see a future with me."}
{"text":"Menu has no variety, food is so so. At least the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is alright and place is clean. BTW  Who goes to Boston to eat Pizza anyway; only in Canada!"}
{"text":"Went twice, hated it twice. Pizzas are too salted, food is very average. Ingredients are low quality. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Boston pizza for a while, but this place was super slow .. !! Pizza took an hour . Salad was awful . 
food was garbage ! 
Hope you read this before you go there ."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite to eat here today while waiting for my car at Canadian Tire. There was an issue with my food (hot sauce instead of french dressing for the salad), however the manager was fantastic and remedied the problem right away - many thanks. We will be back for the helpful service but with lowered expectations for food."}
{"text":"I understand why this BP gets such low ratings. We didn't have the best experience either. Upon arriving, the place only had a handful of tables occupied, but it still took a while to be seated and even longer for the server to show up. 

After that, it didn't get better. First, even though the menu says \"all sandwiches and tacos come with fries\", no fries came with my order shrimp tacos (when I asked, I was told I could pay extra for them). Beverages were really watered down too and we sent one back. And to top it off, the price of the watermelon sangria on the bill was higher than on the menu. 

Not big issues, but it doesn't seem details are the strong points there. 

Better service, food and value easily found elsewhere."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here.  The service was excellent, the food came promptly and the price was right! I'd go back again :o)"}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good.  Never had their pizza, but their sandwiches are delicious.  The service is pretty fast.  Usually the older gentlemen that takes orders over the phone is a pleasure to talk to, but the young kid needs an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"We had a great time! The food was delicious, the server was outstanding, and highly recommended. NY strip was prepared just right and the pizza was awesome!"}
{"text":"Nice location and lots of toppings.  Pizza was soggy and greasy.  Sucks paying for refills and that they don't do pitchers of drink."}
{"text":"Went here to get something to eat while watching the Illini play and figured we'd try something new. We sat/ate at the bar. Service was decent, considering the number of people there. The food was awful. If your restaurant has \"pizza\" in the name, you'd expect it to be good. The crust was dry and flavorless, the sauce was flavorless, and the cheese was flavorless. Now, when the three staples of your pizza have no flavor, you can't expect a pie to be a culinary delight. The toppings couldn't make up for such a poor base.

As I mentioned before, we sat at the bar. Because of this, we overheard bar orders that would strike terror of anyone hoping to drink at this place. On a Friday around 8pm, they were out of: jack daniels, coors lite, budweiser select, and jagermeister. That's just what we overheard, I'm sure they were out of much more. I'd like to note that \"Sports Bar\" is also in the title of this establishment. Consider the irony that their bar would be empty on a game day.

Let's decompose this title:
Boston Pizza: Restaurant & Sports Bar
Boston: I have nothing against Boston, this place just gives it a bad name.
Pizza: Flavorless. Might as well rename this to Cardboard.
Restaurant: I suppose it's still a restaurant, considering they bring you food.
Sports Bar: They ran out of the bar staples on a game day. Enough said.

You'll do well to stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"Half-full inside on a Sunday night, I only saw one server, who was also our server. Martin is cheerful and friendly and his service helped the overall 3 stars rating. My neighbour had told me about their fish tacos being good and that's the only reason why I gave this place another chance after bad past dining experiences here. The fish tacos, a summer promotion item, were decent; two strips of tasty, crispy haddock on crispy, grilled tacos. The 7-cheese ravioli wasn't bad either but the pizza bread we ordered to share was bad! My kids ate the bread first and they reached for their drinks right away. I thought that was strange so I took a bite and man, it looks innocently seasoned with herbs but one bite makes your tongue sting from the garlic salt overdose! 

There was also a fly and a few fruit flies that joined us at our table. 

The funniest thing was when the birthday brownie was brought out. The host had earlier told me the staff would come and sing Happy Birthday to the Birthday child and serve a brownie with a candle. However, it was only Martin who came over with the plate of brownie and wished my child a Happy Birthday. It was awkward when my older child asked what happened to the other servers! The brownie and ice-cream was good though. Martin apologized later and said they didn't have many servers tonight. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Wow. Pricing way out of line even for a specialty pizza. Service sub par.  Had to ask/get waitress several times. 

Building and layout nice, except bathrooms are on second floor.

Will not visit again. I can get better service and pizza from the other guys."}
{"text":"My mom and I have gone to this location twice and have had bad service both times.

Our fist visit it took so long for the waitress to come and see us for the first time that we ended up going to get our own drinks at the bar.
Our second visit the hostess was unpleasant. It took awhile to be seated and when we finally were we asked for water. The hostess was reluctant to bring us water and said it wasn't her job, she was just helping out the waitress. 
The women's bathrooms had no towels and soap. When we advised a staff member they replied with a snooty \"I don't care, its not my problem\" look. The lack of bathroom product was fixed in a timely mater once management was notified. 

Food was good and up to Boston Pizza standard.

Overall - not impressed with the service; don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza 35$ and tasted worst than store bought pizza,  how the hell is that even possible. The crust was thick dry, just plain Savage. 

Then tried the nachos, bought a small portion that cost an arm and a leg. It tasted as if someone forgot to tighten the lid on the salt shaker. Thought it was a mistake and that I had ordered the Salt-baked nachos by accident...It wasn't. 

Gave them a second chance... Oh my Lord!!! I had to bring out my Sphygmomanometer to make sure I hadn't reached record highs on my  blood pressure. 

All in all, if you want to dine here go for its  drinks,  because that's the only thing they seems to not mess up on"}
{"text":"Upon arriving, the bar had only two customers, but waited 5 minutes to have a bar maid ask me what I wanted to drink and if I needed a a menu.  I asked for a drink and a menu.  15 minutes latter, no drink and no menu .  When I got up to leave, I caught the other wait staffs attention and she asked if she could help me.  I sad it it too late for me, I am going next door, but u might want to check up on the only two customers u have left at the bar.   First time I have had very poor service here and I am here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I've been to the other Boston pizza by Amc 24 and I like this location way better. I just like the layout better is all. service was great. I've had thier  nachos and many of their pizza's, they were great."}
{"text":"The pizza burger is amazing!

Other than that, it's just an average restaurant. Prices are too steep really. Service wasn't too bad considering we were a party of 25."}
{"text":"If you are going to order from this place you need to use cash. You would think if your name matches on your debit card & drivers license it would be fine for payment . THEY WANT TO WRITE YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE NUMBER DOWN. Absolutely Not I have NEVER shopped or dined anywhere & they needed to WRITE YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE NUMBER DOWN. & the Manager Lani is beyond rude . I'll be contacting your corporate office ."}
{"text":"Worst bp ever. I should have read all these reviews before heading there. 
We had a 15 years old server who didnt know anything about the menu. Had to go back every time we asked her a quetion. Finally she came with our drinks and guess what, she slipped and dropped a glass of pop on me! 
Then she never bother coming back to take our order after 20mins. My ceasar salad was as blank as it can be. 
She never bothered offering a discount or sth for dumping pop on me, instead a pissed off face like it was the customers mistake.
Wont go back again for sure.
Restaurant like this should be closed long time ago."}
{"text":"It's funny how you can have a national chain, yet have no consistency from location to location. This Boston Pizza location is the worst of the worst! Food was cold, pasta was disgusting, and the pizza we ordered had something sitting on the bottom of the plate. Couple that with poor service and high prices and you have one terrible restaurant. Unfortunately, BP can continue to live in this town because there isn't much choice. Save some money and order takeout somewhere else"}
{"text":"Wow...staying at a hotel near the convention center - just a couple of miles away. Called for chicken fingers and fries at 1:29 PM - not exactly the busiest hour of the day. Order taker said 40-45 minutes. That should have been my first clue. Called at 50 minutes and they said he was just down the street. Called at an hour and they said 3-4 minutes tops. At an hour and 10 minutes they promised to refund my money (in approximately 5 business days). Still no food. At 2:48 the driver called - from the wrong hotel - said he was right out front. I said \"no you're not since I'm standing outside and you're not here.\" Food handed over at 2:52...a full 1:23 minutes after I called in the order. Food is COMPLETELY cold. And it's too bad...actually looks like it might be pretty good. We'll see when we put it in the microwave after we get back 'cause we have to get over to the convention center.

Yeah. Chicken fingers & fries...one hour and twenty-three minutes.

==========

Update:
After getting back from a basketball game and some vicious microwaving, our food was actually very good. So if you know you're going to be hungry for some great food in about two hours, please, call Boston Pizza.

My rating has went from one to two stars."}
{"text":"I will say, my boyfriend and I were pretty drunk by the time we got here... but I can't help but give them a 5 star. The pizza was AWESOME! We are both picky on what pizza we like but, happily agreed that their dough/crust was amazing. It really makes the pizza and they made it perfectly.
We ordered a sausage, jalapeno, extra cheese pizza and a side of mozzarella sticks. (both amazing) but we probably could have done without the extra cheese.. they were very generous!
Another great thing, they are open LATE! 

Their pizza was even better the next day. Great prices, fast service, and really good food."}
{"text":"I thought I'd try their pasta since it was pasta night.  3 out of 3 of us that ordered their pasta thought it was absolutely horrible and boring!  No flavor, hardly any sauce.  
I know... we should have just stuck with the pizza, but it was pasta night!
Drinks and appetizers were fine.  Pricey, but fine."}
{"text":"Everything that happened here was good. Good pizza (i had the butter chicken pizza and it was AMAZING). Our waitress was nice, brought us refills on water without asking, which was awesome. Only problem was that when we walked in, the hostesses, all three of them, glared at us and gave off quite a bitchy vibe. 
The rest was alright, but my friend noted the hostesses as well. It put a bit of a damper on the night."}
{"text":"The service was super bad. The waitress didn't even seem like she cared (forgot her name). The food took forever. I ordered their new Boston garlic shrimp pasta and the shrimp was not cooked and sadly I found out about it after my 5th shrimp (when my bf pointed it out). And now a day after... I'm feeling nauseous as heck and (tmi) probably gonna puke in a bit. 

I'd just suggest to go for the drinks at that specific BP but the waitress messed that up too... ask for their watermelon sangria... she brings me raspberry. It's not a huge deal cus I drank it anyways but zero customer service. 

Told the manager and he just said \"oh I will talk to her\" lol... doubt it. Anyways I know I'm not going there again. 

JUST DON'T GET THE BOSTON GARLIC SHRIMP PASTA  (unless you're trying to puke)"}
{"text":"After being sat down, we awaited for more than 20 minutes for a waitress and no one came. We asked for one and after another 5 minutes, someone came and took our orders. When the food eventually came, the table on our right, who came after we did, had finished their meal and started leaving. Quality of food is at par with other BP but service needs improvement."}
{"text":"First time eating here but wanted to take family out for early dinner treat. Food was OK, server and other staff seemed like they really didn't want to be there or serving us. Too bad BP first and last visit"}
{"text":"Guy quoted \"try Walmart and hung up\" worst customer service by far! I'm not a local or will ever order from them!"}
{"text":"In all honesty, this is by-far the worse BP's location I have ate at, overall BP's is a dying franchise and I can tell you why, the waitresses always expect a tip from you when paying the bill at the table, they stand around till they see how much you're gonna tip them, they don't even ask you if you want change. The food was decent, but wasn't good enough to finish, I got the Lasagna, not a lasagna, more of a pasta dish with cheese covered on top, and the waitress screwed up on our sides, having to pick off the toppings. Gouda was too sweet and was obviously microwaved (one of my biggest pet peeves), I don't know what to say, BPs is the place to go for late night week day drinks, but it's definitely starting to fall off for the food they make. I don't have the right to do this, but what I can recommend is changing the entire menu. BPs you're falling apart."}
{"text":"We come here every once in a while, this is one of the better locations we have been to. 

PROS
Good portion sizes. Lots of choices, even for picky eaters and vegetarians. Salads are incredible and filling. Kids welcome (if that's your thing!) Service has been consistently good (not exceptional). Price is fair. 


CONS
Bathrooms in this location are up a big flight of stairs. There are ALWAYS lots of kids here (maybe that's your thing.... It's not mine). It can get a bit noisy. 

Will I visit again? Sure!
Recommend to friends and family? Yep, sure."}
{"text":"Went to this place with Fiance today and loved the food, tasted fresh as always and it was brought to our table quite quickly. I feel they could include the dipping sauces with thier Pizza Bread, it is a bit silly to charge extra for a small thing of dressing. 

Waitress was highly friendly and I liked that she came to our table to see how we are doing, and if we needed anything. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my parents out for dinner and we decided to go to this Boston Pizza . So when we arrived the place was dead and we got sat right away which was good . But that's all that was good . Our server arrived at our table and she was nice but when we ordered our drinks, we got them 30 minutes later. When she decided to give us our drinks (finally) we ordered our food, pizza for my parents and a steak for me . 
I used to work at Boston Pizza in a different location and when someone orders a pizza you need to give plates and a pizza stand and some seasoning and wipes right after the person orders . We didn't get anything until ANOTHER 30 minutes later. Plus when she finally brought the pizza stand SHE FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE ! I had to remind her . 
Our food didn't come for an HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES  (from the moment we ordered. The food shouldn't take THAT long to cook) and the food was terrible . Steak tasted like someone rubbed rotten eggs all over it and the pizza was soggy. 
And through out all of this BS she didn't come back to check on us, she didn't ask us for refills . She just ... didn't come back . Worst service I have ever experienced . 

If I could give this no stars, I would ."}
{"text":"Just arrived to city after a long day of flying. It was 2 PM so the restaurant wasn't busy!! Needed a good lunch and a couple drinks to get leveled out and recharged. Had been to other BP locations and they were really good. 
Took quite awhile to get served (although there were staff around). Meals showed up, mine was way wrong. Said would take 10 mins but ...... 20 mins later, nada!!!! 
Quite disappointed with experience at this location."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter stopped in to have dinner before going to Calgary for a concert. She ordered the kids meal (comes with meal, drink and dessert) and I ordered the chicken stromboli (what it used to be called, they recently changed the actual name). 

My dish arrived and the chicken inside was pink, cold and raw, the shredded cheese inside wasn't even a bit melted. I realized this after taking a couple bites as it has a thick pizza crust around it. It took about 5 minutes to call a waitress over and she did apologize and suggested she 'heat it up'. No thanks! I instead asked for a plain cheese quesadilla, the thought of ordering anything else with meat made me nauseous. 

She said she would call over a manager, so obviously they were there at the time, but he/she never did come talk to me. 

By the time by cheese quesadilla arrived (with undercooked fries) my daughter was done her meal. The waitress dropped off the bill and said 'is everything ok now, I mean, after the fiasco anyway?' ... (fiasco? I call it attempted food poisoning but ok). 

She also didn't offer a discount for serving me raw meat (least they could do right?) and didn't bring my daughter her dessert which was supposed to come with the meal. 

I will never go back to this or any Boston Pizza most likely. The quality of Boston Pizza's food, as compared to years ago, is long gone."}
{"text":"I always have a good time watching the game on the bar side.   They put whatever we want on the various screens with sound.  Can't speak for the resturant side. 
Beer is cold. Food has been getting a lot better as of late. Cactus cut nachos were awesome. It feels less corporate then other locations so I go for 5 stars."}
{"text":"My daughter said to check out this place. We got a small pepperoni pizza and i got the fingers.  It took a minute for food because its prepared fresh.  The cheese on pizza is fresh and fingers were good. They could do better on the ranch but I'll definitely keep going back to eat."}
{"text":"My son and I have been here about 4 times over the past year.  Our experiences in the past have ranged from okay to best I've had in a long time, but last night was not good.

We noticed that this place wasn't busy for a friday night.  Usually there is a line up.  We got a table and another fresh, new face was there to take our order.

When the pizza arrived, it was only luke warm, and my son commented that it looked like whoever made it was obviously in a hurry.  Probably 2\" of bare crust in some spots.  When we picked up the stacked 3 plates the waitress had left, the bottom two had bits of other people's food still sticking to them, and were covered with cold dishwater.

The waitress had disappeared, so we sat there for 5 minutes, and then asked another waiter working the next table if he could find our waitress.  He asked who that was.  I pointed to her hiding behind a partition in the restaurant, and he went to tell her we needed attention.  She then worked on the computer back there another 2 or 3 minutes before coming over.

When we showed her the mess on the plates, she said \"ohh, Gross\" and took them away and brought new, wet ones, back.  At least they appeared to have been washed.  She then went away for another 20 minutes before coming back to see if anything else was okay.  During that time, I had helped myself to their cutlery drawer to get myself and my son missing knives.

When the bill arrived, two large pizzas and two sodas came to over a hundred bucks with tip.  We're done with Boston, and particularly this one.

Obviously their boss need to spend more time running his restaurants, and less time on \"Dragons Den\".  These kids are trying, and I still left her a 15% tip, but if you have high turnover, you need to have a much more substantial training program than what I see here.

Training is the key to consistency, and the lack of it is what you're seeing in the other reviews.

So, if you are in for a relatively expensive adventure, be their guest...."}

Ramon lied and said he was the owner and said he was the manager and double teamed me with \"the girl from the night\" because she didn't want to give me her name hope someone does something about this their is better people out there that need a job obviously they don't because they don't care"}

{"text":"this place sucks. they have a waitress called Heather, who will talk smack about you behind your back and drop f bombs left right and center. this place is poorly run, and the food is awful. steer clear of this place. they clearly don't care about  their patrons."}
{"text":"Even though the service was slow to start, and our waiter seemed moderately clueless, things got better. 

I don't believe I've ever seen 75 ounces of beer in one jug before but it was a thing of beauty. The central ice pillar down the jug kept it perfectly cool right down to the last drop. 

The food was adequate. Based on my past experiences with BP in Montréal, I'd say this location is an improvement. Sadly, we had to send the wings back because they were terribly undercooked. Seeing how it was UFC171 night - I can understand that it was busy and things get overlooked, but the dining area was quiet - so food should have gone out correctly the first time. 

As an ambience ... The bar area gets a huge thumbs up. There isn't a spot where you can't feast your eyes on a big screen. 

Overall - not my first choice, but definitely added to my options for a game might out."}

The menu has a wide selection to choose from including a wide range of pizzas. They also have a good selection on alcoholic beverages to choice from (the first place that actually had Twisted Rocket on the menu)"}

{"text":"Called in for a delivery order. One small pizza and a side. Was told 40-45min delivery. 

Order came one hour 15 min later. My small pizza was cold and rock solid. After all this wait! 

This is terrible service. If you can't do delivery right, dont do delivery. Why are you delivering cold food that is late and looks stale?

Paid $35 for a tiny pizza and a small side. What a rip off! Go away Boston Pizza. You are broken. 

Should've just ordered PizzaPizza."}
{"text":"This place is meh...seriously.  I mean - it's kinda over priced, don't you think?  I paid $30 for chipotle pasta and a root beer.  Yes I upgraded one of my side dish but $30!  

I don't know....I'm just not a big fan of BP's."}
{"text":"Customer service makes the difference...and Boston Pizza clearly has no knowledge of the meaning. 

Calling in for a delivery for my company I found the man on the other end annoyed I was calling and irritated that I had a pretty lengthy order. He couldn't tell me how much the delivery charge was either. One thing he was excellent at was repeating the order to ensure accuracy yet when I received the order there were fried mushrooms added to the bill. The delivery man was even less thrilled about his job too. Perhaps this is understandable, but he refused to speak to me and only pointed to what he needed from me.

Food was, as always, mediocre at best. So if you're in the mood for rude employes, long wait times and semi-decent food you better check this place out."}
{"text":"I have been to this Boston Pizza location a few times before, it has really gone downhill over the years. 

We went for dinner on the Friday of March Break. I assumed there would be more people since when we have ate here in the past it has been fairly full. Despite the fact that it was march break and they had a deal where children got a free pizza meal that week the restaurant was pretty empty, I now understand why.

We were 2 adults and one child and they seated us in one of the booths right near the kitchen. The seats of the booth were so ripped up and one side was even covered in duct tape to cover some of the rips. Very sad looking. 

The waitress was fine, no problems there. The food came in a reasonable amount of time, but there also were not many people. The pizza was extremely salty so the waitress had to give us many water refills. I feel that both the food and the general state of the restaurant (this location) have gone downhill. Which is a shame cause we have eaten at other Boston Pizza locations and they are not nearly as bad.

My advice would be to chose another location...we wont be returning."}
{"text":"\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\" Our visits to this location have been hit and miss. A few years back, we got the mini sliders for my 5 year old, and the meat was as hard as a hockey puck. Replacement sliders weren't much better. Pasta during pasta tuesday was over cooked and mushy. When I ordered in a few days ago, the spinach & artichoke dip was SUPER spicy. Tasted like an entire tub of garlic powder had been dumped in. Pizza was burnt, and gave both my kids the runs. My son missed school because of it. Pasta was too oily. Saving grace was the cake. And for the price (over $90 including taxes & tip!!), SO not worth it.

Will not be supporting them again."}
{"text":"Food, not bad.  It Is what it is, and usually what you see is what you get.. However the service... it's PAINFULLY slow, ugh.  Took a couple of friends from out of town for din last week.  Tons of staff running around it seems, but no one serving you?  Quite bizarre frankly, like they're all wearing blinders or something..  Waited 5 mins. for table sitting on bench at front door, three staff walked by and ignored us, at least three times each, (not busy on a Tues. night btw, mostly empty diningroom-side tables!).  Eventually flagged somebody down and got to one, then waited almost 20 mins. to order some wine (only to be told it was out of stock... one of their few 'featured bottles', really?), after all.  Double ugh.  Half an hour later, got to place an order for food, and finally got a drink.  Never did see our original waitress again after the initial drink order, she just disappeared somewhere in to the 'netherworld' it seemed.

I have never written a negative review before and hate to, but I have been to this place at least 5 times since it opened and keep trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, but geez!  Each time the service has, sadly, been disinterested at best,  AWFUL at worst..  doesn't seem to be a staffing # issue so I don't get it at all?!

Glad to see I'm not the only one who has had similar probs re. this issue.  A shame... otherwise they seem like nice people.  I wish success to any new restaurant in the 'hood, no matter how 'fancy'.  Sorry for the not so poz post, but I'm frustrated!

(Note:  3 reviews have been 'removed/filtered' that are 1 or 2 stars also saying the service completely sucks, so I guess I'm not the only one who's had issues? Hmm. May want to work on that BP?)

On the upside, good/easy parking and may be fine for a beer & wings and to watch a game or something when you've got a lot of time?  Lots of tv's all over :)  Cheers all."}

I will not be back."}

What can I tell you...
- the beer on tap is ice cold and very crisp (I had coors light and my husband had Stella and they were both perfect)
- service is friendly and attentive
- food was great. Served hot and timely and they even remembered all of my food modifications! We had the Thai Bites to start and then I had the hamburger with yam fries and my husband had the pepperoni pizza - everything was so delicious!
- atmosphere is fun and lively :) We ate in the bar area and watched the hockey game. 
Best Boston Pizza there is!"}
{"text":"This location really needs to step up how they run security here. I walk in with a few of my friends who are regulars here and i got denied service.. how you may ask? Well one of the hostesses claimed i was banned here from a recent outing for calling her an inappropriate name.. This experience was so embarrassing.. first off they mistakened me for whoever they claimed they banned. Ive only been in this establishment like three times this year including this situation. I continuously told them they're making a mistake but they would not believe me. After an hour they finally said fine come and sit down we will serve you guys. And when they did they purposely limited our drinks i guess cause they still thought i was this 'guy'. Clearly they dont keep pictures or any record of what people look like that get banned from here for bad behavior. And all im gonna say is if you are 5'10 and brown skin tone you have a high probability of getting denied service. Worst experience I've ever had at a bar."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst locations of Boston pizza I have ever been to. They seated us by the door which let in a freezing cold breeze and we asked to be moved but they totally ignored us. Then, not only was the meal cold but we did not have any cutlery. Disgusting service, horrible food. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice relaxed atmosphere,  attentive staff and food is pretty good too. Am going to frequent this place often now. Pizza rolls are amazing although the bacon wrapped steak wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Usually love this Boston Pizza but the daytime staff is not as efficient as the nighttime staff. Ordered a pound of wings as our starter and got it at the same time as our entree. The entree was another story. My wife ordered her pasta without mushroom and what do ya know there's mushrooms. We tell our server and she starts looking through the pasta and tell us there's not mushrooms in it meanwhile there's a big piece of mushroom my wife pulled out on the side of the plate. Then a manager comes out and asks what happened we re-explained everything and she said the same thing. Ridiculous service. My wife being allergic to mushrooms isn't gonna chance it and these employees keep trying to tell us there's none it's unreal. I didn't ask for free food or anything jus the food I ordered to be correct. Terrible. My advice go on friday or sat night when Amber or the other nighttime bartenders are working. It's a world of difference"}

I made the mistake to call dominos pizza couse  I had a special on the mail for a large 14$ pizza I was on the phone for about 45 minutes I never had that happen before I thought it was a joke I was so mad and hungry at that point that I was willing to wait till someone answer so I can bitch them out lol well someone did and guess what they told me sorry we are closed hahahahahhahaa any ways thanks again Boston pizza for being there for me I will never try to cheat on you again !!"}
{"text":"I go to BP almost once a week, usually the Queensway or Guelph locations, and this one is becoming my least favourite and it's the one I live closest to. I tend to go here with friends as a last minute/last resort thing.

Pros: 
- The service is generally fast
- There is usually lots of seating 

Cons
- Compared to other BPs, the food could be more consistent/better quality 
- I'm 25 and still get ID'd even when I'm there at like 1am, I never get ID'd at other BPs, it just creates an awkward atmosphere right from the start because you clearly don't trust me or my friends when we're all at least 21
- The servers are not very friendly. It's like they don't even care if they get a decent tip, stop bringing my mood down every time I go here! 
- A blonde server in particular with long hair never has her hair in a ponytail which is gross seeing how she handles plates and she makes the entire transaction awkward with her complete lack of personality. There shouldn't be dead silence when I'm paying with my debit/credit, you could at the very least ask me how my meal was or night was. Please quit because you are clearly not cut out for the customer service industry and hate people."}
{"text":"Take out service is not for anyone in a rush.  Was told 30 minutes but really it was 45 and the restaurant didn't seem busy. 
I guess I am the first English guy to order take out. Ordering was a disaster. And what I received was ridiculous. Asked for no olives or hot peppers on the nachos, I got them....  didn't realize they did not send two orders of fries so I had to go back to the restaurant. When I returned to my hotel with the fries I realized the hamburger I ordered came as a steak sandwich. I ate the sandwich hoping the burger would have tasted better because I wouldn't order that steak sandwich again. Asked for plates and a side of mayo. I didn't get them. Oh...  and to top it off...  juice comes with the kiddie pizza, well I didn't get that either. 
Way to go Boston Pizza Brossard. You would have gotten zero starts if it would be possible. Pizza Hut would have been a better bet"}

{"text":"My 4 year old daughter and i made a quick trip to calgary for an appointment at childrens hospital we arrived late and had a horrible time getting a room. Finally we found one at the econo lodge next door. Now normally i am not a fan of boston pizza mostly from previous bad experiences. But the little girl was hungry and it was close so we stopped in. The hostess and our server was amazing very efficient and polite, my daughter ordered a kids grilled cheese and i ordered the pesto chicken penne. I drive truck for a living so you can imagine i am not much of a patient person when it comes to waiting on food especially when you just spent all day driving with a little one. Unfortunatley we dis have to wait, and wait, and wait  now as a former chef i know exactly how long it should take to throw a chicken pesto pasta and grilled cheese together even when you are busy and an hour is unacceptable .....or at least it would have been in my kitchens. The server however did everything she could to make us happy including offering us free salads to munch on while we waited and gave us updates constantly which in turn made me feel like we were not forgotten about.overall the food turned out pretty good tasting and the service was pleasant although if i am in a hurry next time i will try some where else."}

{"text":"Came here for Father's Day dinner but wasn't busy at all when we got there. The whole experience was essentially just a long wait. It took a while for us to be seated (no line - there was just no one seating people). The whole time, it felt like our waiter was purposely avoiding us and not looking in our direction, so even when we needed anything, we would either have to wait a long time, or chase her down. She also disappeared for a good while. Food was okay. Red sangria wasn't particularly good.

tl;dr
The service was super slow and not great even when there weren't that many people. Probably won't be back."}

Recommend this location as seems to never be a line up for seating in the bar, unlike other restaurants on Mcleod Trail and the service and food are aways acceptable."}

Take out food is ready within 15 min. of ordering and is always tasty."}

Rude hostess, slow servers, hostile manager.

And when they do make a mistake (which has only been once, they made pizza with the wrong crust and was no fault of the server) they quickly fixed it by bringing out the correct order and let us take home the other pizza at no charge. It's not often you see a place like this where the employees really care about the experience, so great job to the management and employees at this location. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was wary about coming here after seeing the rating as it stands, but after a day at the Toronto Zoo my family and I were viciously hungry (for pizza and pasta) and had few immediate options -- so pleased to report we were happily surprised! Now, the restaurant wasn't busy, and I know that seemed to be a recurring problem with some of the other reviews. But my experience was quick, friendly service (at the door and our server) and the food was delicious! Just not a huge fan of the clanging bleeping alarm sound ambiance from the kitchen. Reasonably priced, though. Not bad at all for a box restaurant. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I go here on almost a weekly basis with my best friend and we love it. Its always our default place to go. We have always gotten a table so great for last minute, of course it gets busy on a Friday or Tuesday night given that a cineplex is just around the corner. But I love the food at BP, haven't had anything that I didn't like so far. Staff is really friendly at this location and my order usually comes a lot quicker then most other restaurants or locations. Overall, great service and food."}
{"text":"SAMANTHA HORRIBLE  SERVER 

We have been many times for dine in and the service is average. But as usual the servers do not have good listening skills.  I asked for my meat to be cooked well done as they cook it only until it is warm and I wanted it well done. I also ask \" Samantha\" the server to apply my discount and she refused. I will switch Boston pizza because I know it can't be the food but the horrible services."}
{"text":"Horrible Boston Pizza, in my opinion! I would rather drive to the other end of the city than ever order from here again, and let me tell you why!

Every visit I have had at this location has left me frustrated. From cold food to wrong orders, hour wait times for entrees to half hour wait times for the bill, I couldn't be bothered to return. The location is, however, always clean and welcoming, hence the two star rating as opposed to nothing.

I thought perhaps take out/delivery would be better, but it was significantly worse. I have never had a delivery order that was correct. Why keep ordering if they screw up, you may be wondering? Well, when you have those unignorable cravings for Cactus Cut Potatos, and they are the only location that will deliver to you when it is -30 outside, you convince yourself to give them a chance.

My last experience, in particular, with this location changed my mind for good and now has me drive the 45 minutes to another location to eat. We ordered a Spicy Perogy Pizza (which comes with sour cream), Bandera Bread (which comes with Santa Fe Sauce) and two orders or Cactus Cut Potatos (my favorite!). If you have ever had the Cactus Cut Potatos, you will know that it is really the dip that makes them so special, and as such, I always order extra dip (I love it with the pizza and bandera bread as well). Our order came 1.5 hours later, and upon unpacking we realized that we had no dip, no sour cream, no santa fe dressing and cold food. What is the point???? I promptly called to place a complaint, waited on the phone for half an hour, and was told they would send the dips out but they would take up to another two hours to get. That would put me eating my cold food past midnight in the middle of the week. No thanks The manager on the phone was quite abrasive, talked down to me regardless of their mistakes, and then promised a $30 discount certificate to be mailed as an apology. We received a $15 coupon.

Needless to say anymore, I have not returned to this location, nor would I recommend it to anyone I know, or any of my fellow Yelpers."}

{"text":"Today was my kid cousin's birthday and we decided to celebrate it by going to the Boston Pizza on 4307 130th Avenue SE #220, Calgary, Alberta. While our server, Kelsey, was amazing and patient with the 8 kids that came along with us, we were greeted with smug looks, impatience, gossip, and rolling eyes from the other staff.  
Yes, they were a handful, but they were controlled and weren't running around and screaming. They sat down and ate their food and occasionally walked around.  If the staff had a problem with us, there was absolutely no communication about it other than the obvious snottiness in their body language, attitude, and tone of voice.  

My uncle, boyfriend, and I always make a point of being polite and none of that was reciprocated from anyone other than Kelsey.  For a restaurant that considers themselves \"family-friendly,\" you guys may need to do a better job of training your staff to be more considerate."}

Pros:

-Service was fast and attentive
-Pizza portion was great for the price (Individual pizzas are $5 on Sundays)

-Upstairs washrooms (you can't expect me to eat cheese, carbs and more cheese and hike upstairs just for the washroom!!!)

Overall, A+ I'll definitely come back (on Sundays)."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we keep coming back here. I guess it's just convenient because the barber/haircut salon I go to is just next door.

Honestly, the food is ok. It's nothing special, nothing mind blowing. Regular family fare.

What bothers me is the service. It is sooooo slow. The servers are usually not around and sometimes are not even paying attention as they serve. I've finished my salad and 1/2 of my sandwich before the server actually came by to see if we needed anything else. My son wanted some Parmesan cheese and he was able to eat 1/2 of his pizza before she got around. The restaurant is not even busy. There's maybe 10 tables occupied in the dining area, 2pm lunch.

Well, my son likes it. Given a choice, this won't be my first or even second."}

My friends and I were planning dinner at our usually Jack Astor's, but due to a fire evacuation our night out had moved to this location of Boston Pizza. The food is what you would expect for the price: worthy of eating but nothing extraordinary. The service this night was exceptional with our waitress being very polite and friendly. The speed of service was also quire reasonable, then again the place was slow. Like most restaurants do, everyone gets their food at once, and if that requires more waitresses, than it is done. I was quite surprised the waitresses were left the task of serving their own tables their food, and since we were a table of eight it required three trips for her leaving us receiving food at different times. Quite odd.

Due to this experience I almost gave this location a four star. But then I remembered one night a couple years back where a bunch of us went to this location later one night. The host took twenty minutes to seat us, because he was in charge of completing purchases for some reason. Then our waitress either deliberately ignored us, or no one knew who was responsible for our table because it took twenty minutes for us to be acknowledged and have drinks served. Therefore, this memory turned the four stars into three. 

Gotta love the service industry, the quality of service is like a roller coaster ride."}
{"text":"Found a metal bolt in our pasta; this isn't the first time we've found foreign objects in our pasta. A few months ago we found the paper in our pasta they seperate the chicken with."}
{"text":"I came here with my family because we felt like eating out, but nothing too fancy. We were not greeted at all. Upon walking in, there were three teenagers at the front giggling and chatting. Which is fine, but they hardly acknowledged us and made us feel rude, like we were intruding. One girl pulled herself away and sat us down. My mom found the waitress very pushy, but I thought it was ok. However, she didnt write down out orders, which turned out badly...for me. After our wait, she brought all the food to our table. But she mixed up my order! I told her and she apologized and then they had to go make my freaking lasagna. So I was left with a glass of water, drooling and watching everyone eat their meals. When mine finally came, everyone else was done and I had to eat awkwardly while they hovered over me and made it obvious they were itching to leave. The lasagna was good, though. The waitress brought the bill just as a plain receipt, not the typical booklet thingy they have in restaurants. My mom had to tuck the money under the ketchup bottle. This is the worst Boston pizza I've been to. They only get two stars because the food was good."}
{"text":"Went there last night after work and got a personal pizza. The Boston Special. Crust was undercooked in the middle and practically everything fell off about 50% of the pizza. I was so hungry I ate it anyway and just discarded the undercooked portion of the crust. It wasn't even a good pizza, I was just starving after a long night at work. 
Felt nauseous all the way home, and 5 hours later woke up to throw up the entire contents of my stomach. Long story short, do not go here if you like good pizza. Just skip it all together and go to Pizza Rock. Or Dominos. Or the frozen section of the supermarket."}
{"text":"You know what you're going to get at every Boston Pizza.
Good food, good service, good prices.
At this one? You also get great music (let's here it for Pink Floyd!)

... and a server who was able to figure out separate bills without trouble."}
{"text":"Ok... I've read the reviews and \"get\" the negative ratings.  The place is older, it's in a \"rough\" area and it's a typical fast food pizza joint.  That being said, it is what it is.  The important thing is the food. It's great! Best cheesesteak in town. Pizza is good and so are the sandwiches.  Plenty of fries with an order and plenty of seating. Don't expect fancy and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So terrible. I have celiac disease and ordered a salad from the gluten \"wise\" menu. Server asked if I wanted to add chicken to my chicken salad, then brought out the wrong salad. Not celiac friendly because I woke up gluten sick the next day. I know it was my salad because everything else I ate that day was prepared by me and stuff I know is safe. When they hiked their already inflated prices, they failed to change them on the gluten \"wise\" menu so I was charged $1 more than the listed price. Overall, I paid $16 for a crappy salad that made me sick. Steer clear, especially if you have an allergy! My friend also had a myriad of issues with her meal, but they are too long to list. This place is a dump. On my way back from the washroom I saw a staff member laying his head down on the food passbar. I'm all done with BP's forever I think."}
{"text":"Good friendly service but I honestly can't undrstand how this company stays in business due to food quality. 
I have had to eat at Boston pizza about 4 times in my life. Always disappointed with cheap and tastless quality of the food. Everything here tastes like cardboard canned and microwaved   for some reason. School cafeteria food has more taste."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of items on the menu, and almost all have been great (sometimes a bit bland, but the right condiments can get you the flavour desired).

My current favourites are the Chicken Tacos and BBQ Chicken Pizza.

I've had mixed experiences with the service (amazing to horrendous), so that's why I took a star off.

Pro-tip: sign up for their email newsletter. You get a free appetizer (there's 3-4 options) right when you sign up, and a free pasta or dessert on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Tried one of their $9 individual pizzas here for lunch today, which is about $5 more than I would be willing to pay now that I know what they're like.

I asked them to go very easy on the cheese, which they ignored.  The crust reminded me a lot of Pizza Hut crust, except that the entire center section of the pie was so soggy that the crust was falling apart.  For reasons that I don't quite understand, they put salt and pepper on the pizza, and lots of it.  To make matters worse, they didn't sprinkle it on evenly so every third bite or so was doused in either salt or pepper.  Some of the toppings looked black because they were covered in so much pepper.  

I was with a big group that ordered a variety of things. My observation was that the entree salads were huge but very pedestrian; iceberg topped with a meat, some cheese & croutons with a plastic cup of dressing.  Burgers and sandwiches looked OK but you could see the salt on the fries from across the table.  Pasta dish was very, very small and came with a weird burnt looking bread stick thing that resembled driftwood.

We went in for a late lunch and were the only customers.   Service wasn't necessarily bad, per se, but it should have been much, much better considering there was no one else demanding the server's attention.  I give two stars instead of one because it was during a down time, so the food may not usually be this bad.  I don't plan on finding out first hand though.  One visit was enough for me."}
{"text":"The location is easy to find since its right on Las Vegas blvd right across the parking lot for the OG. 

There are no frills inside or outside of Boston Pizza.  It is like an old local sub shop on the East coast.

They have one of the best chicken cheesteaks I have had and I have had plenty.  Good American cheese with peppers and onions on a lightly grilled hoagie roll.  It is spectacular. 

Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with their pizza but they have many other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Was at Boston pizza for Mother's Day 2014
That afternoon. From the kitchen you could here swearing, The entrance of the kitchen servers was goofing around, I had the jambalaya it came out with no shrimp in it, And The other food we ordered look like it was thrown together. Our bill came over $100 dollars.
I was thinking how bad it was so I called the manager on duty that afternoon. I don't like what he said. So on Monday I called the general manager Who runs that Boston pizza. I told him everything that happened and how the food look. He was very unhappy how my experience was at Boston pizza that afternoon. He said he would send me some gift cards I thought that was nice of them. The gift cards never came out. So I called back in July and I was told it was sent out but it never did. So I called back in August 20,2014 and I talk to the general manager again. He said sorry he would send them out right away. I got the gift cards on 27 August. I got in gift cards
25 dollars,
Enjoy one free complimentary order of wings (10wings)
2 kids eat free on Saturday in August.
Can't use that because I don't have kids and there's was one more Saturday left in August,
And the last card was fore. Come to Boston Pizza for 4 Lunches and get your 5th lunch FREE . That one Expires on 31 of August
So I thought it's a joke giving expired gift cards out to people. Or for Days to use the gift cards
Thanks Boston pizza"}
{"text":"I'm only ever here to watch an important MMA fight or NBA playoffs. I would never go here \"just of the food\" itself. Boston Pizza represents so much of what I dislike about restaurant chains. Some of their menu is passable for food, but the rest is just pathetic. No matter what you do, DON'T order their \"famous\" spaghetti dish. You're better off boiling noodles at home and adding ketchup. I left the plate untouched save for two or three bites. The service has been decent during my visits. Overpriced food for poor quality dishes is not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"The food was good, and different.  variety in choice.  Service however was horrendous.  And the manager disregarded everyones suggestions for broadcast because he wanted to watch his fight.  All we wanted was the volume down so we could talk. Was quite annoying"}
{"text":"Do not go to this place. Its really sad Boston pizza has lost its touch. It used to be the first place when my friends considered going to socialize and eat good food. Now it has become an environment where the waiters are over worked arrogant with no sense of customer service. We went to bp for my brothers birthday.

1) we were served with a shot of vodka in a plastic sauce cup. When we requested a shot glass they informed us it will take time since they have run out of shot glasses. They never ended up bringing the shot glass either way.

2) we ordered a team pitcher and the ice funnel in the middle was filled with paper towel to stop the ice from coming out.

3) The waitress tried to pick up four glasses at once and dropped two of them only to have it shattered on the face of my two friends. They were both shocked and the waitress didn't even offer to help or apologize initially. 

All these 3 things let to us calling the manager. She actually didn't feel the need to provide an explanation for the shot glass incident and the beer ice stopper. She casually said sorry for the glass breaking and said it happens. It was almost like the staff never wanted people to come there. Either they were over worked or hated working there. It's a shame that Boston pizza has come to this but if you don't want to ruin your day, do not go here!"}
{"text":"If you have Celiac or a gluten-intolerance you will be pleased to know that Boston Pizza now carries gluten-free crusts!  How exciting!  We always order ours from the Uptown 17th Location and have always got really great pizza from them.  

The gluten-free crust is pretty good!  I am impressed. You can either order any toppings you want or you can get any regular Boston Pizza pizza on the gluten-free crust. I love this new service.  All from your computer as well which is great!"}
{"text":"i ordered a pasta, twice, they screwed it up both times.  good for generic, tasteless food.  Maybe the CEO should leave dragons den and focus on how bad his food is at BP'S."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple:
-Overpriced
-Waitress was a ditz
-Manager was a weasel"}
{"text":"Service was fine, no problems.

Food was what I expected from a big chain like this - no better, no worse.

I would have given it a 3 star \"A-OK\", but...

1) the floor/carpet in our seating area looked liked it had NOT been vacuumed in days
2) there was a funky smell in the air.... a cross between a meat fart and blue cheese

If you're allergic to kids, then this may not be the place for you. This has your usual big chain \"kids-running-around-and-parents-pretending-to-discipline-them\" shenanigans."}
{"text":"Big fan of Boston Pizza but not this one.(location) specially because of the service or may be we just were the chosen ones to experience it that day. One of the kid took a sip from her mom's drink and waitress mentioned that she will have to charge us for 2 drinks as she found us sharing a drink and it was not allowed as per policy...sorry but I felt a bit embarrassed though would have never mind paying for 2 if it would have been put nicely.. this was topic of discussion within our friends group through out the meal as no one experienced it before ..decided not to visit this location again...though will be happy to go to Boston Pizza somewhere else."}
{"text":"BAD PIZZA !!!! Hey , I am Vegas local and I eat at many local pizza places , yesterday I got this pizza thinking it's cool to eat old school Boston Pizza , 

1. Pizza was greasy 
2. Pizza was salty ( no clue why ) 
3. Feels like I eat cheap made pizza

I am a big foodie and this pizza got 1 star from me 

U want good pizza ? Don't go waste ur money there 

U will wake up in the middle of the night drinking a bottoms of water from the amount of salt they put there !!!!

If the owner reads this !!! Change ur pizza !!! We are in the 21 century"}
{"text":"This place is NOT what the reviews make it out to be at all! Pizza is too greasy . I ordered chicken wings (10) sauce was on the side and in a little container I used it all up with TWO chicken wings come on now!!! (Picture of sauce attached) 

The guy on the line seemed so blaaah not pleased at all that I was placing an order."}
{"text":"If pizza is your business stick to that. Worst damn spaghetti I ever had in my life! Meatballs taste like water logs no flavor whatsoever!!!!! Tried to post without a star!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food...... the service is just horrible, the lady that answers is a rude uneducated woman with a nasty attitude, the deliver man calls your phone yelling at you to let you know your food is ready, but wait once you go outside to pick up your food he randomly disappears and comes back in 15 minutes, because he's super impatient, other than that the ranch is reallllllly good !!! if it weren't for their delicious greasy bar food I would rather go across the street to Viva Las Arepas !"}
{"text":"Looking for a non commercial place too get wings while visiting Vegas, a server at our hotel recommend this place. Wings were good, crispy, not that frozen packed your texture..sauce was good though I like a little more heat"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was typical good Boston Pizza....
The food was mediocre.....and the service SUCKED!

This is unusual for this place.....I was in the lounge, the gal came and took my order..brought my beer....came back after a little while and got me another beer...she then went on her break....this is okay as any working person is allowed 2 coffee breaks and a lunch as far as I am concerned......BUT for the next 1/2?hour no one came any where near me. The bar gal serviced the tables all around me and avoided me like 'the plague'......so needless to say ...no tip left......

The girls seemed more interested in visiting amongst themselves instead of making sure the customers were happy....joys of being in your 20's....where was the manager making sure they were doing their jobs??"}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to be taken upstairs and seated, where there were only 3 occupied tables. 10-15 empty ones. Then we were ignored forever. Not going to be coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years. It has gone through a couple owners, but currently they've got great people working there. We always used to go there for Monday Night Football, so our group decided to head back last week and see if it was the same. The lounge was quiet when we got there, and was quiet for most of the night. The place looked fantastic. Clean, modern and very appealing. The best part was the televisions. They have screens everywhere and they show the game with sound.

We ordered the cactus cuts and when they came out and our waitress said they were too crispy and she was bringing us another plate. We had no qualms with the first plate but still nice to have a waitress be proactive. I had the perogy pizza which I highly recommend. One of the best pizzas in town. My friend ordered the dessert which is cheesecake wrapped in pizza dough. I know - sounds crazy - but it was delicious.

Overall it's a great lounge to catch sports at, they have great food, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"These are nicely finished chain restos. Very comfortable and decent service. My primary complaint is the food.  They simply cannot cook a decent pasta or pizza. The food is either pre-cooked or nuked or just plain mishandled.  I eat here out of convenience but the reality is I consider this place to be the weakest of all the chain restos like this.  Very poor food."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and good specials! Watching football, basketball and hockey at the same time is easy with all these screens. Great drink specials."}
{"text":"Really wasn't happy with the service here. I came down to Calgary to visit my friends as part of a day trip away from Edmonton.

We weren't all that hungry, so we just ordered desserts. Our friend wasn't quite sure what she wanted. So she took a bit longer to decide her order, and allowed us to go ahead and order ahead of her. After a few check ins, our waitress got annoyed with this and rolled our eyes at us. We also never got any offers to refill our drinks. 

As a result, we didn't tip and we left. The whole thing is surprising because I never previously had a bad experience with Boston Pizza. I'll still come to BP's, but it's unlikely I'll come to this location again."}
{"text":"Poor service is an understatement. We were greeted very well, but that's where it ended. Placed our order, got our drinks. That was the last we saw if our server...

We waited about 1/2 an hour for two kids meals and a pizza. Nobody checked on us.

When the food arrived 1 of the kids meals was wrong. They were back in 2 minutes with the right one - but how do you get a meal ready in 2 minutes when it took 1/2 an hour the first time. 

The pizza that I ordered wasn't cooked enough - what 1/2 an hour wasn't long enough?

Usually you are offered cheese with your pasta meals - I had to get up and walk over to the kitchen to get some cheese - this after wait 3 minutes for the usual \"how are the meals so far\" discussion that occurs 2 seconds after you take a big bite of food. That conversation never happened.

I will NOT be going back to this Boston Pizza...

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Got here at 11pm for ufc 207. Waited 10 minutes to get beer. Now hour and half later almost and I've watched every barmaid come to table in front of me drinking their wine and bullshitting with who I believe is the manager. Not one has asked me if I was good w my drink. And one barmaid who is tall as he'll keeps sitting in front of me blocking my view. Used to be a good place w great service....unfortunately though...I'll start going to one of the other bars at Centropolis...."}
{"text":"They said i was out of their zone, and had to talk with them for 15 minutes to explain to them that I am in their zone after the same person kept putting me on hold and hanging up on me.

I will rate it better when i try their pizza, ordered somewhere else in between trying to confirm i'm in the area and getting hung up on."}
{"text":"Worst service I ever got in a restaurant...horrible... Waited over 45 mins for pizza and another 45 mins for dessert... And they brought us the wrong dessert.. Never..... Ever...will I eat at Boston Pizza again"}
{"text":"Great for when you're in the mood for pizza! Sounds funny but we are from Florida & the only pizza places we have are like \"delivery\" pizza places not an actual sit down, bar & restaurant atmosphere along with a good pizza! Wish we had something like Boston's Pizza back home. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is that the service was slow. The pizza was awesome, I forget the name but its the spicy chip pizza with sour cream or something like that. Oh & if you're from the South or maybe even the States don't ask for ice tea because you won't be getting brewed tea you'll be getting fountain tea like Nestea!"}
{"text":"I feel the need to also review, we are currently at this Boston Pizza and like the other posts I must admit this place is terrible!!! Worst mumbling server ever, half the meals were brought to the table wrong and the rest was burnt! Kids burgers were hard as a rock, salad was mushy. Avoid this location!!! Go anywhere else besides this place, or just skip the meal all together! No food is better then this food."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Boston Pizza! Our server Deanna was amazing! She always made sure our drinks were full and our food was tasty! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Boston Pizza hire friendly and competent staff.
Again, it is positive for our Community!
One day I stated to one of the staff that I wasn't up to cooking and he stated Mama will cook for you!!! Lol
Excellent Salads and other choices of food!"}
{"text":"Only good thing to eat here is the cactus cut potatoes. I must figure out their dipping sauce!!! Everything else is bland with no taste, most of the staff in the dining area are quite ditzy also. One actually admitted to us that the fish comes in frozen. Smart."}
{"text":"My Husband and I are fans of BP's.  We always to go the lounge when we go for dinner here.  They have a number of TV's around, so we will come and watch a hockey game here.  Their menu is pretty extensive, offering salads, pastas, sandwiches, pizzas.  I love their pizza bread, santa fe stromboli, boston lasagna, sechuwan pizza and their chocolate explosion cake.  I tend to rotate those items.  The lasagna here can sometimes come out looking like someone just threw the noodles in the dish and topped it with sauce and cheese, no layers at all.  But it ends up looking like that anyways and still tastes great.  They have some great drinks here and a number of beers on draft.  A team sized pitcher of beer is always fun with a big group of people.  The staff here is always friendly and you can tell there are regulars that come here.  They have a pool table, which is usually busy.  The prices of food have risen in the last couple years, so look at spending $40 a couple with a pop each."}
{"text":"Really good food here. I went not too long ago and it was awesome. The waitress was nice and took our order right away. We gor the nachos and they were fantastic. Every single chip had toppings on it. Ordered the steak greek salad and it was amazing!! Had a really good experience here and will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The mediterranean Pizza is yummy. 
Great Serivce and people. 
I would definitely recommend this location for my friends!"}
{"text":"I am that hungry and only order a starter size Fried Wings.  The wings are fried golden brown and ordered mild with Honey Garlic on the safe side.  They are not dried and tender.  

Another appetizer that we order is Caesar Salad.  It has Romaine lettuce tossed with garlic dressing topped with croutons.  The drawback for this is our stomach do not feel alright for the night.  Maybe the salad is not washed clean enough.

The Boston Royal of course remains its standard with smoked ham, pepperoni and shrimp.

Overall I like the environment and the spacing between the tables.  One word of caution is if you are ready to order, catch the server or you will have to wait for quite a while.  They are friendly and distant but too far to get hold of."}
{"text":"We have come to the restaurant personally to book a table for today.  When we arrive the receptionist told us there was no reservation for today and no one can book a reservation.  We told her consistently that we have a table.  She replied it might be her manager's booking but it has nothing to do with her.  What a restaurant that everyone has his/her booking list?  After a while of negotiation, she then turned to the reservation booklet and found our name.  Finally we can have our table.  It happened on a Saturday night.

The Jambalaya Fettuccini used to be one of the best but it turns out the look is not presentable and the color is very light.  Its taste of course is not so good.  The Boston Premium Pizza is not too salty and is thin and good.  The Nachos is ok as the cheese almost glue all the Nachos together.  The Caesar salad is ok.  The chicken wings maintain its standard.  

Every waitress seems to work on her own.  The last few times when we come it is very organized.  I don't know whether the store has changed its owner or manager but it better improves its service!"}
{"text":"Went here after after shopping with friends at square one. Ordered the Jalapeño and Crispy Onion Prime Rib Burger with Caesar salad as the side. The burger was really good and presented well. But the salad was really poorly put together looked like lettuce that fell out of the burger on to the side of the plate with a couple croutons thrown in there. 

The service was decent waited 10m to be seated for some reason. It was completely dead at the time we got there. Once seated service was faster. 

Over all I rate the experience 3/5"}
{"text":"Ummmm.  Apparently the kitchen is too busy to cook a plate of noodles for a 11 month old. Waitress said \"you have to order a full kids meal cause we are too busy to do a special order\". Didn't know plain noodles file are special order items.  They are fairly special to a lactose intolerant kid."}
{"text":"Ok I'll be upfront with all of you.  I'm a fan of Boston Pizza.  That also makes a good reviewer because I'll tell you if the Boston Pizza is bad, because I'm used to their food.   

Well like Any Boston Pizza this has the atmosphere you'd expect.  A Sporty family friendly dinning room which has moderate lighting and the odd TV in the corners. The hosts are both competent and friendly at this location and rarely if ever using recent memory have ever gotten an order wrong.  

I usually end up buying a Pizza from them however I do buy other food items as well.  I generally enjoy their menu and the taste of their food.  It's not a five star restaurant but if you are going to eat out for example you are thinking of a place like Casey's, Pizza Hut or Swiss Charlet, then you should try out Boston Pizza and I would recommend this location if you are near by.  This location will be the typical service and food you will get at a well run Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"If you read my other reviews you will read that I am a fan of Boston Pizza.  

.... Besides this one....

Generally boston Pizza for me is a place to go and eat if you are thinking about places like Swiss Charlet and those types of restaurants to go to.

I went to this one and ordered my favorite Pizza on the menu and my wife ordered sand-witch of some chicken verity.  both orders came to us cold and amazingly wrong.  Some cheap fixes were made to our order and my wife ended up not eating the side as she was turned off by it.  These are educated complaints as I would say I'm a heavy user of Boston Pizza.  I would say I go to Boston Pizza usually once a month, on occasion two or three times a month.  

Anyhow the service was slow and uninviting.  No discount was offered for the meals and we were charged for everything.  Being Canadian we did the Canadian thing to do.  We didn't make a fuss but we will never go back to that location again."}
{"text":"I can't see where these bad reviews are Comming from, when you first walk it everything is clean from the counter tops to the floors, the staff is very helpfully and service is great. The food is tasty and comes in good portions. The bar tenders are always busy either taking care of the customers, cleaning or organizing the bar. I'm very happy with the food and service and will keep Comming back."}
{"text":"Once again we took a chance with B.P. and were pleasantly suprised.

a) We did'nt have to wait in line for 1/2 hour or more.
b) Service was prompt and attentive.
c) They did'nt screw up our order. ( which is a first)
d) The food was good.

Maybe they have new management or something, I'm not sure, but they did it right this time after so may failures."}
{"text":"Chicken wings gave both me and my fiance food poisoning. Head office didn't really acknowledge our complaint. They wouldn't do anything without a receipt. The only receipt we had was a credit card slip, which apparently was not enough to at least apologize for our experience. I ended up missing a day of work and my fiance still hasn't been able to eat chicken wings (and it's been like half a year)."}
{"text":"2nd time in a row bad Boston Pizza experience. Lost orders, wrong bill, slow service. Should know better to go here by now. Mr Treliving's book was on display though.  Lately BP has gone downhill, last two experiences haven't been good. Usually a decent enough place if on the road and need something unchallenging.  (Nov 2012)"}
{"text":"Good location with very poor service. Okay food but overpriced. The management definitely needs to educate their servers. We went as a group of 4, ordered some food and a pitcher. The waitress tried to empty the pitcher by pouring the beer into our own glass. She spilled almost half a pint but didnt even offer to bring a new half pint. The guy who seemed like a manger was chatting with other female servers... why would someone like this is hired as a manager? Never going back here even if this place is just few min away. If you crave pizza, order from other places like Dominos or Pizza Pizza. If you crave beer, there are plenty of other options in this area."}
{"text":"Bad food for an expensive price prepared by a 15 year old that doesn't care. What else can you expect from Boston Pizza?"}
{"text":"This boston pizza is incredibly poor. Honestly worst than going to a small fast food place for food. Even though we've been many times and it has always failed to please, we gave it another go. The pasta we had was clearly microwaved and was still frozen. The bacon on our burgers were burnt pitch black. The nachos we had were inedible. The cheese was hard and like plastic and the chips themselves weren't crunchy. They were soggy and gross. The service is always unreasonable. I feel bad for the lady that serves us because she's always there alone taking care of so many tables. It takes her about half an hour to just get our drinks. I've always had good experiences with franchise restaurants but this has disappointed too many times. Overall terrible experiences. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Once we got going it was fine. As soon as we walked in (Tuesday at 7:35pm) we asked for a booth. The greeter immediately started arguing with us saying that the booths are for 6 guests. I asked if they were expecting a bunch of customers. We finally got our way but it took some convincing.  We came so close to walking out! So close! She finally agreed to give us the booth. In all my years of going to restaurants I have never had to \"fight\" to get a booth. We we're not impressed! And the next time we will be ready to walk out. In this economy where going to a restaurant is a real treat for some people, Boston pizza should want to keep us happy and not start off with negativity!!!"}
{"text":"as far as Boston Pizza franchises go, this one is quite nice. Same menu as the rest for the most part. Friendly staff and quick service makes this a popular place in Airdrie."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I find it a pretty quiet location. It's nice that I can walk right over after seeing a movie. The service is good. 

The food is decent. 
Baked Chipotle Bacon Penne: my favourite 
Chicken Quesadilla: my friend always orders this and it's a big portion
Cactus Cut Potatoes: really greasy but taste good with the dip and has a spicy kick
Chicken and Mushroom Fettuccini: found it kinda bland 
Spicy Perogy Burger: tasted like a normal burger but it's good
Pizzaburger: again, tastes like a normal burger but it's really big 

I love how they designed their take out boxes. They even give you a bag with a cardboard insert! 

You always get mints after :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I find it's never very busy when we come at night. Service was great. Food is good too. I enjoyed the Most Valuable Burger (13.99 + 1 for bacon) although the Brownie Addiction (6.79) was a little stiff. My friend said the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (13.29) and the Chocolate Explosion (7.79) were great. Will continue to come to this location."}
{"text":"Typical of a Boston Pizza.  Food and service was average at this location.  Manager/Owner who was there not doing much of anything could of checked in on us to ask how we were enjoying our food and if there were any issues.  The patio was closed except for those who wished to smoke.  Cigarette butts all over the place and over flowing ashtrays."}
{"text":"Horrible, awful, greasy.I will NEVER ORDER FROM BOSTON PIZZA AGAIN. I ordered a stromboli, was sent a calzone. When I called to complain, manager had the nerve to tell me they are the same.... Uhhh, no they are not. Had i wanted a calzone, i would have ordered 1. 10 Wings came with 1 piece, not a stalk cut up, but 1 piece of celery smaller than my pinky finger. RIDICULOUS!!! And to top it off, the manager had a bad attitude. Save ur time and $.... Order elsewhere."}
{"text":"I frequent this location, simply because it is one of the few nearby watering holes where the coworkers and I can grab a drink after work. I've been here countless nights, and the bar section is understaffed 9 times out of 10. Usually, in a bar area that will probably seat about 50-70 people, there will only be 2 servers for the entire area (including the BARTENDER!). Of course, this causes to you wait long for them to come take your order. If you know what you want when you first come in, order fast, otherwise you'd be suck waiting! As with most Boston Pizza locations, the food is kind of mediocre, nothing really special. Even their pizza, at times, leaves something to be desired. Chairs are wobbly, which could potentially be a problem if you plan on drinking heavy; I've seen a few people fall. It's OK, but there are definitely betters bars around Markham. The best thing about this place is the drink specials (note: team pitchers were discontinued at this location last time I checked), the worst thing is the food. Good place to watch the game, but not much else."}
{"text":"Best fingers, best ranch, best phillies, and awesome meatball subs!! Not just in town, but EVER!! Food is great and the location makes it easy to grab a bite without being too far from a good night out on the town!! LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, supermarket-quality pizza. All my friends warned me that Boston Pizza sucked, but I had to try it for myself. Now I know exactly what they were talking about.

For $18, I got a small pizza that looked like it came pre-made from a factory. My friend's looked a little better, but also resembled cheap frozen pizza.

Just about anywhere else nearby is better value, and better quality. Try these instead: Dukes Refresher, Scadabush, REDS (though its douchetacular), Blaze Pizza down at Dundas Square, etc."}
{"text":"FALSELY ACCUSED OF DINE & DASH!

Drove down from Edmonton to Calgary to visit a friend. I was hungry so I called Boston Pizza to order take out. I picked up my friend and then we drove to Boston Pizza to pick up the take out. He waited in the truck, I went into the restaurant, received my order, paid, then we drove away. 10 minutes later my wife calls in a panic from Edmonton saying that the Calgary police have called her at our home. Apparently one of the BP staff members took down my licence plate number after \"witnessing\" a \"dine & dasher\" getting into my truck before we drove away. The police officer also informed her that they have video footage as evidence and I am in \"big trouble\". My wife is very upset because this situation makes absolutely no sense. She knows that I would never involve myself in such a crime. There is no video footage simply because we did not allow any \"dine & dashers\" into my truck to assist them in their escape. The video threat was some bullshit police intimidation tactic. I call the cop. Over a few phone calls we clear things up. The situation seems to have been resolved. Hopefully I have been cleared from the list of suspects that may have assisted an alleged \"dine & dasher\" that has bailed on his $20 bill! Thanks Boston pizza! Thanks Calgary police! Nice job on ruining our evening! I also noticed that this was one of the dirtiest BP's I've ever been in and the smell was noxious. Maybe new management is in order? I have a feeling that Jim Treliving, founder of Boston Pizza, would approve of a swift apology and a generous gift card. I'm waiting."}
{"text":"A good place for a family meal.  Nice, but not fancy.  Wait staff were very friendly.  Lots of sports on the many large screen TVs all over the walls in the dining area, which you can ignore if you want to as they are high enough.  The food was good.  My roasted beet salad was excellent and the other meals in our party were prepared well.  Dinner for four including an appetizer and one drink from the bar was about $75 CAD."}
{"text":"My local BP service is ok, food is good. Cleanliness could use a bit of ratcheting up."}

{"text":"Delivery is brutal.. Waited hour and a bit called to reconfirm my order was coming.  They assured it was.. After a second call and 3 hour wait left my house to go grab a pita down the road.. Delivery never did show up..

Knowing the previous delivery experience I opted for pick up the next time around.. Had some friends over and waited the requested 30 minutes before coming in for pick up.. We showed up to pickup pizza and they said they knew nothing about it.. Stood around for about 10 min then had to re-order and wait 30 more minutes..give this place two thumbs down.. Unless u sit down in the lounge it is ok service/timing etc.."}
{"text":"We went here few days ago to see the UfC 114-Rampage vs Evans on PPV.They charge $10 cover and by the time the fights were on there was a fair bit of people inside.We sat at the bar and had a good view of four screens over our heads,The female bartender was decent-attentive.We had couple drinks and a med hawaiian pizza which was good.The overall look of this place was bright and airy,not too crowded.The bathroom(female)was clean.All good-will go back."}
{"text":"Hey. Just a word of advice: Don't ever order the BlackBerry mojito at Boston Pizza. It looks pretty but tastes like you're drinking a lemon. Literally. I'm gonna go cry now."}

{"text":"I'm just going to copy my complaint I emailed to this restaurant. It took six weeks for them to attempt to resolve this, and this is far from resolution. In my complaint i outlined much was spent. And the situation and circumstances of the day, and the answer to this location is mail the customer a 15$ coupon. Shame on them. Seeing the reviews here, it seems I'm not alone, this location does not care about their customers, and sullies the name of Boston Pizza franchises. 

My  just turned 6 year old son wanted me to take him to Boston Pizza for his sixth birthday, and just turning 6 on this day, he was sure to let everyone he came in contact with know that it was his birthday


After being seated in a quite empty restaurant, the time lapse for our server to come and introduce herself and get a drink order was long enough that under other circumstances I likely would have gotten up and left, but knowing this is what my son wanted, I bit my tongue and waited. 


Next was something that was rather upsetting and appalling, considering, based off of Boston Pizza's website, under 'Our Concept'  you consider yourself \"a family-friendly casual dining restaurant\", I was shocked when my Six year old son asked me 'Daddy, why are those two men beating each other up on the TV' and I looked up at the televisions, and half of them in a Family Restaurant were on some type of a fight television network, exposing this graphic violence to families. I am pretty sure these fights are geared towards mature audiences, as there can be blood. As well people have had limbs snapped and teeth knocked out, and I have heard that fighters have been beaten to death on more than one occasion.


As I attempted to convince my son to not look at these televisions, I frantically looked around the still not busy restaurant for a server or host or employee I could address my concern with and politely request the channel be changed. there was not an employee on the floor to be found. Had it not been my sons birthday, I would have left. (Mind you I was not close to home, so I would have been more incensed has I would have had to walk out with my son on his birthday dinner.) Minutes which seemed like an eternity passed before I saw any employee - which was actually our server. I waved her over to our table, and politely stated my feelings that UFC was not an appropriate program for a family restaurant, it may be fine in the separate room sports bar part of the establishment, but it was offensive to my family and I in a family restaurant, and I politely requested the channel be changed or turned off. to which she replied, 'I'll speak to my manager and see if she will' And in the still not overly busy, practically empty Boston Pizza, now I was looking at the time, it still took almost another 8 minutes for the channel to change. (And I have requested a channel change from Football to Hockey in my local Stouffville boston pizza, while the restaurant has been over half full, and it has happened almost immediately, not a prolonged period of time later) 


Getting over the shock of our exposure to extreme graphic violence we ate our lukewarm served meal (???) but at this point I was not going to complain about that, as I felt everything was taking an eternity (seeing a server, getting a soda, changing a television channel, getting our meal) we would just eat our meal, get our son a piece of cake for his birthday, and never return to this particular Boston Pizza ever again. 


To add insult to injury, the waitress just came and plopped his 'birthday brownie' in front of him and was about to walk away (no song, no candle, no explanation if they are short staffed, out of candles or incapable of singing or wishing  a happy birthday due to some beliefs, or if boston pizza has completely abolished singing or expressing sentiment towards  children's birthdays, and new policy/protocol is just delivering a birthday desert without saying a word.) Not knowing anything about this, regardless, I still attempted to order the feature desert to eat in a somewhat timely manner with my child as he at his 'non-birthday' birthday desert. My son who is not a fast eater, took near 15 minutes to eat his desert, and as he was almost finished, the waitress made her way through the sea of empty tables to tell me my desert would be another few minutes. I told her forget it, and just please bring me my bill


Overall this was an absolutely horrible experience, for what was supposed to be a special day and a waste of almost 75$. I feel a need to let someone know, as if this is the level of CS from this particular boston pizza, its not surprising the place was virtually empty, as who would want to ever go back there."}
{"text":"Been here on many occasions.  Usually not too packed out so it's good that you don't have to wait too long in line.  In fact, many times I go, you can be seated right away.

During the World Cup, a lot of people were watching the game there.

Servers were generally nice and courteous.  

Would definitely come back in the future if the occasion is right again!"}
{"text":"On entry, we were attended to immediately and seated right away.  We then were left to sit for about 15mins when  a waitress came and asked if someone has helped us as yet.  No hello, welcome, my name is.....  After telling her no, she quickly took or orders and rushed off.  We then had to sit for almost 1/2 an hour before the food was delivered.

We, a party of 3, had a large Viva Italian pizza and a jambalaya fettuccini.  Both dishes temperature was just luke warm.  The pizza was soggy.  I can only guess that it was made and sat in the back for a while before it got delivered.  The pasta dish sauce tasted like they opened a bottle of store sauce.

Service was not the best.  They seem to have a lot of servers, however, we did not receive any.  The restaurant was only about 1/3 to 1/2 full at any given time.

For the price they charge - pizza $31.99 and the pasta $18.69, we could go to a more upscale restaurant and pay the same price, with much better service."}
{"text":"Located near my hotel on my trip. The place feels more like a bar or a tavern. The service is good. The waitress were nice looking and polite. The foods ( 2 different pasta dishes ) looks great in initial appearance. But the taste is awful at best to describe. The noodles weren't cook soft and tender. They were hard, high in sodium, very oily, and chewy. The salty meat were in tiny bits, looks like cheap scraps of low quality cut deli meats. You would think it's a meal to be fit for the KING from the \"Drag## Den\". Has he actually taste it himself ? Not worth the $$ and taste."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend birthday party. I ordered a double beacon bbq burger as I was curving for a burger. It taste really good and I do recommend it or try the mvb burger. I also order a somersby apple cider with ice on the side with it. However they ran out of somersby apple cider which I wanted to order a second round. The server offer me another brand of apple cider in which I never try before. After, the server offer me strongbow apple cider which I tried it and found out not my type of drink. The server ask me if the drink was ok for me and I told her that is really not my drink, she then offer me for another drink for free since they ran out of somersby  but I refuse to do it since I already drink the strongbow cider and don't wanna waste it. Because of this I found the service was excellent.
The con was that it was ufc night, and every customer needed to spend 25cad minimum in the restaurant but It was understandable because of ufc night. Two of my friend in the party left because they already ate and just wanna order a drink and don't wanna spend 25cad minimum chargers. 
At the end overall I had a somewhat satisfied experience dinner in this restaurant, if they didn't ran out of somersby apple cider I might given a higher score. I want to give a 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Horrible management!!! Dee should not be training or managing staff!! My meal was not done right and she basically said it was my fault. No concept of customer being right or taking ownership of an issue."}
{"text":"Quick service. HOT boneless wings.  Tyler never let my schooner approach empty.  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Visiting first time for beer and apps. I  enjoyed the Thai chicken, the shrimp tacos were average. I will try their pizza next time.  Location is convenient. Service was great."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, for dinner, drinks, or dessert.

Their food: don't ever come here for dinner ever!!! Actually I should say, don't ever go to ANY boston pizza for dinner. It's gross!! No matter what you order, the pizza sucks (I thought it's suppose to make wicked pizza), their pasta sucks, their wings suck. 

Drinks: just like any other bar

Their DESSERTS however, will be the only thing I'm gonna praise them for ;). There's so many awesome variety, unlike the boring and typical \"CHEESECAKE\" that some places only offer. Boston pizza has this amazing panookie thing where it's a hot cookie (freshly baked?) with ice cream on top.  And they also have something called chocolate explosion.... And well the name sounds amazing enough ;)

The staff are friendly though!"}
{"text":"***UPDATED
manager was really nice and struck 2 items off our bill
We also believe he spoke to the server as her attitude completely changed later. I tipped her. :)

First time at this location.
Recently started eating halal.
Wow. Dont bother. Go. Leave. Or stick to veggie options.
Halal to them means tiny portions of baked chicken with no breading or flavour whatsoever.

Our server, made a face when i asked her about it and told her it was my first time eating halal here.
Judgemental much? The portions r tiny for halal, they claim theyre the same. Complete bs.

Server assumed we should know the details behind halal options. Sorry we cant read minds n dont work for bp. Manager took off half the amount for thai bites that had no breading. Thats why 2 stars.

Im sitting at the restaurant writing this review. I got my horrible appetizer about 15 after ordering. And 45 minutes later still no food.

We wont be back.
Im sure she knows why she didnt get tipped. Poor attitude in an empty restaurant does that."}
{"text":"I like the cracked pepper dry ribs and the yam fries with a Rickards White. They are pretty cheap at happy hour."}
{"text":"I used to go to Boston pizza at least twice or three times a month.

Appetizer:
Nachos with spicy chicken is my absolute favourite! 

Chicken & Goat Cheese Flatbread Pizzatizer is so good with chicken breasts, BBQ sauce and goat cheese. Unfortunately don't have this anymore because it was a promotional thing during winter. 

Chipotle Chicken Pizza Taco was another $10 deal, tasted like Taco Bell (don't suggest)

All meat bites is boneless chicken bites. You can choose different flavours, I got a medium flavour. 

Food/Mains:
Jambalaya Fettuccine ($16.99) has become one of my new favourite pasta from there. It has shrimp, chicken, sausage and veggies in marinara sauce. 

Can never go wrong with Chicken Parmesan ($17.49) 

Shrimp Tacos ($12.99) come in threes and you choose a side. I thought they were kind of lousy.

Crispy Chicken Pecan Salad ($13.89) for all you healthy people, please try this! It's an assortment with many things like chicken breast, pecans, cheese, bacon, eggs and veggies with ranch dressing. Best salad I've ever had and I can never finish it. 

Desserts:
The Panookie (5.99) is honestly just a big soft cookie with ice team in the middle. Nothing too special on my my watch. 

Chocolate Brownie Addiction is to die for. 

Customer service:  Really helpful and friendly! We always get accommodated right away. Elicia has become our favourite server, the many times she's served us never left us disappointed and when the times she's not in charge of our table, she always comes by to say hi and ask if we are doing okay."}
{"text":"This is not my regular Boston pizza location but came here after visiting Ripleys Aquarium! 

However I love bp nachos but these Nachos made me an even bigger fan. Better than the Queens locations in Brampton. They put so much more chicken and cheese on it. Not stingy with the toppings on any of our other food as well. Food was excellent. 

Ambience:This location is obviously huge with two floors. Get a really nice outside view of the busy downtown streets. Though it felt too suffocating and crowded to me. The reason why I gave it 4 stars was because a little dirty and the washrooms stalls are a few and were not clean. 

Service: Was friendly and nice! Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"I am not really a fan of Boston Pizza in general-it started WAAAAY back in Ontario where the running joke (regardless of location) was if you wanted to eat there before seeing a movie or anything else time sensitive, you had to arrive with your order ready and tell the person who seated you what you wanted before your butt had hit the chair.

Here in Calgary I've had slightly better service (but still average) but the food quality has been mediocre and the restaurant cleanliness in a few locations has been sketchy. I tend to only go to Boston Pizza when someone else has made the decision for me, usually as part of a group/team thing.  It's predictable I guess which is why people pick it. This location however surprised me recently.

I attended a group dinner after a team building event. We were seated on the patio which was surprisingly not noisy despite being right on 16th Ave. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. He had a great sense of humour and made some good appie recommendations which got a few people at our table trying things they normally wouldn't have. He was quick, efficient (asking about more drinks, bringing extra waters when he saw ours were low). He served the way servers used to serve when service mattered.

The food was decent and it made me realize I am not used to getting fresh, hot food when I got to Boston Pizza-I guess it is always just warm. He had totally recommended the right amount of food for our group to share too which was nice.

Even though this location is old, it was very clean and well kept, including the washrooms which are always a good measurement point.

It was nice to see this location seems to have higher standards than what I expected-we had a great time and I'd consider going back to this location again."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with my children tonight, was super busy tonight which is great the manager needed up taking over our table and was very attentive and interactive with my children which made them feel great to be part of the conversation."}
{"text":"You never know what you will get - service is not consistent, and food is hit or miss.  I ordered the Mediterranean salad, and much of the lettuce wasn't good. Our mains came out before we even got our appetizers, and the staff seems to turn over frequently. Hostess can be rude-made a face when we requested a particular table (place was fairly empty so it shouldn't have been an issue). There is potential for them to be good, but there are so many little things wrong with this location. Head office should really step in with strong management and fix their service issues."}
{"text":"let me just say off the bat the food was good.but my booth I sat in there was sticky stuff on it and the fork had crust on it.i asked for water and I got diet coke.th3 staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The service was okay by today's standards but the food was sub-par. I had twice baked wings which were incredibly greasy and had a lot of fat on them. My husband couldn't tell the difference between his teriyaki and honey garlic wings and agreed they were quite fatty for twice baked. My son had chicken fingers which had very little colour or flavour and about 10 fries. Our daughter had a grilled cheese which also had little colour to it. I can say that my salad was good but not enough to motivate me to come back.

As close as this is to our house, my husband and I agree that we would much rather drive to Avenida or Chinook than come back here."}
{"text":"Great food better service.  Had NY Strip steak grilled great with a peppery flavour. Go here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Poor food quality. Pizza had no sauce, dry and just a complete waste of money"}
{"text":"I went with my friends yesterday and there was a hostess right in front (girl with red hair). She was on the phone while we walked in, but she made no effort to acknowledge our presence and continued to talk on the phone while no one else came to help us for a good 5 minutes. This was at around 6.30pm on a Tuesday evening therefore it was not that busy. Finally, who I believe was the Manager of the store, came and welcomed us, which I think was one of the most unenthusiastic welcome I have ever received from a restaurant. No smile, no energy, it was almost felt like you are here it is more of an obligation to get you seated kinda vibe. There were multiple booths available but they weren't cleaned when we walked in so we were provided with a normal four person sitting area. Ordered the French Onion soup which I felt was average in taste but the presentation was poor. Almost amateurish. My friends ordered the Veg and the Bacon burghers and they were decent. There was something lacking in the overall experience at this location. I have been there before, probably during previous management and it was a much more of a pleasant experience and vibe, which is missing now. Not what I expect from a brand like Boston Pizza and likely won't visit any time soon."}
{"text":"I work near here so go quite a bit for lunch. I always have good food and the staff are great. I find it a little nicer than most Bps. For lunch at a family restaurant I have no complaints."}
{"text":"i choose this place because its kids friendly but our server very impolite... bad service... i am sure not choosing this particular location again ... i love to go to Scarborough and Whitby , they got best service ever. one star for  the front desk."}
{"text":"There was a group of 11 plus an infant on a Sat night so you expect a certain amount of delay on things
But this evening was ridiculous. Our server was nice enough but aloof and slow. He took forever to get our order, then took forever to get our drinks. I ordered the pizza burger and poutine and my wife a salad and French onion soup. The fries were overcooked, the burger was undercooked and doughy had to send it back....bleh. My wife's salad was good, large portion for a starter salad, as for her French onion soup, the cheese was grainy,not fully melted, not good. Others in our party had issues with there meals as well, including a nasty tasting French dip sandwich, minus the au jus. Overall of the 11, 6 were unhappy either with the service and/or quality of food. We will not be returning here anytime soon, if ever..."}
{"text":"Wanting a beer after work a colleague and I decided to try out this location of BP's conveniently located 2 doors down. We went on Wednesday and it was happy hour all day which helped lift our \"spirits\" The pints in the burbs are usually much less expensive than I am accustomed to living in the beltline. 3.50 a pint was a nice change of pace from the 6.50 to 8.50 we downtown denizens quaff on a regular basis.  

Food not so good. We order a \"thin crust\" pizza to share, I believed there is only 3 of them on the menu. When it came to the table it was obviously not a thin crust pizza. The server assured us it was a thin crust pizza and that it would \"settle down\" or some excuse of that nature. If it looks like a duck, swims like duck and quacks like a duck its probably a duck. It was only 3 small pieces so we decided to avoid conflict, suck it up and eat. Mistake. I messaged my buddy 3 hours later with \"Thin crust my a$$ this dough is still rising\"  Extremely gassy and uncomfortable to say the least. My friend advised me he vomited his back up.

We will go back, next time for the beers only."}
{"text":"Been coming here all my life and tonight I came in at a different time the normal (usually come here in the day.. Never have I had a Philly without provolone, peppers or onions. It was AWFUL. I had to put ketchup on it! YOU NEVER PUT KETCHUP ON A PHILLY!"}
{"text":"Had a very interesting situation for this dinner outing. Had a party of 5 including a 5 year old kid. After walking around the Double Tree for a block, we found that this was the only place open at 11. The waitress was extremely accommodating and let us sit in the closed dining area because the minor in our party couldn't stay in the lounge. It actually ended up multiple families in the area were entering and they opened up the dining area again, so we didn't feel as bad for doing it later.

We ordered a draft pitcher of an amber lager, can't remember the name. It was great. 

I ordered the mushroom swiss burger with cactus fries, which was a potato chip like fries with a spicy garlic sauce. I was hoping that it was going to be super spicy, but instead the chips were not seasoned at all. I would have saved the extra $2 and ordered regular fries. The burger was extremely good, as it comes fully dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, long sliced pickles, which is how I normally prefer it.

The waitress was extremely friendly and made small talk in between taking our orders, delivering our food, and refilling drinks. She also gave a small discount for being a hotel guest, which was a pleasant surprise. Perhaps this is a Canada thing, but credit card readers were handed to us to approve the funds and designate a tip in either dollar or percentage amount, which was a nice convenience.

All in all, our pitcher of premium beer, my swiss burger with cactus fries, and another burger for my fiance only ran less than CAD$60. This is a great price considering all the other expensive restaurants either adjacent to or attached to the airport hotels in the area. I'm a fan of Boston Pizza, and maybe next time I'll even try to get a pizza!"}
{"text":"I went to this location with a friend for dinner. The place was dead. Service was quick, impersonal and pushing rude. Food was ok, not overly hot, or tasty. We shared an appetizer and each got a meal. I've been to other Boston Pizzas in the city, and in other cities. The service was much better. I won't be coming back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"So after years of avoiding BPs my parents wanted to give it a try. Our waitress was pleasant and our food came out In a reasonable time. But it was nothing too exciting. They gave me a very small portion of salsa for my monster Santa Fe salad. The \"foodie\" menu didn't look like anything exciting, although I wouldn't know about flavours as the entire foodie menu at first glance seemed to be full of dairy. Don't feel as though this will be a destination for us again any time soon."}
{"text":"Piss poor service.  Sub par food.  Screwed up everything on a slow day   Manager was pretty nonchalont about it like it was normal and comped our whole table.  It was that bad then sent us off with a $50 gift certificate ( which we gave away)  . At least we didn't have to pay for that disgusting and army that,  all the wrong orders."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Vegas. Don't let appearances fool you here, give it a try and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Scarborough but am always here due to the LA Fitness location that opened the past year. 

That being said, I have been going to this Boston Pizza quite a bit lately, and wanted to share some thoughts on the service, food and atmosphere.

It is almost always empty everytime I go, with at the most, 10-15 people in the restaurant spread across 3-4 tables. Even with nights where there are specials ($10.99 pasta on Tuesdays) there are a limited number of people whenever I go. 

I should say that I do go late, so maybe that's my interpretation but it is in a pretty bad location right at the intersection of Warden & Eglinton. 

The service is okay. The staff don't seem to enjoy their jobs and you can almost always hear them talking about their tips and customers they have served recently. Nobody seems to be upbeat and you can catch some of them frequently taking smoke breaks. 

The pastas are not that great and are definitely a rip off if you are paying full price for them. Even on the special night, it's pretty pricey for the quality but it is a warm meal and it's a good place to eat with a loved one or friend. 

All in all, it's a standard Boston Pizza, the food is adequate to above adequate and there are many TV's. The service could be better, but it isn't bad so will not hold it against them. Have had better though. 

They do takeouts and they are always having promotions and specials. Keep an eye out for those. Without them, this place is pricey. 

3/5 and still would recommend over Moxies or Milestones."}
{"text":"I go here with coworkers after work every now and then. Service, food and drinks are always better than my expectations. Definitely one of the best Boston Pizzas I have been to."}
{"text":"I ordered from this location for delivery and the forgot my pasta... They gave me my chicken and shrimp but no pasta. When I asked for it he said I could have the money or the pasta. I ordered here for food of course I want the stupid pasta. Never again will I order from this stupid location. Nice management, work on it."}
{"text":"Well, we all know BP, and how people like to hang out there after work for beer, snacks and to watch sports.
So I am not sure what made us decide to go there tonight for dinner, maybe the close proximity to the liquor store across the parking lot.
We shared the cactus cut potatoes with cactus dip. Not too fussy about this thing for $10.79.
Mains: Spicy Perogy pizza and Chicken Parmesan.
Perogy pizza: she had tasted this pizza before and liked it but said that this one was nothing like she remembered. Sadly it was an overcooked yeasty dry crust, covered with congealed dry cheese. The dollop of sour cream was ok though, rating: 1.5 out of 5.
Chicken Parmesan: The chicken breast was a bit watery and the crust was too dry and hard from the deep frying process. The portion size of the garlic mashed potatoes was small, and it did not taste like garlic at all, I guess I got the regular mashed with some pieces of red onions in it... The seasonal veggies consisted of broccoli, cauliflower, carrot slices and red onions, they were bland. Hey Boston Pizza people, vegetables can have a taste, just give it a chance!! Rating: 2 out of 5.
The service tonight was nothing special, the appetizer came quick, but it took some time to get the main course and the food was prepared and plated without attention to detail. I guess it is just what it is...
We gave it an overall rating of two. This place is just not the type of restaurant or food we like, and the visit tonight reminded us of that. We will go back to our \"usual\" family owned spots around town and enjoy their hand crafted foods."}
{"text":"Decent food, good options if doing keto as you can order their hearty sandwiches sans buns and they all come with a couple side salad options. Not our favorite pick for a meal but we were in a pinch and really hungry, worked out well. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Fidèle à la chaîne. Service rapide et courtoie. Belles portions dans les assiettes à un prix très raisonnable. Bonne pizza et bon plats de pâtes. Pas de la haute gastronomie, mais parfait avant d'aller voir la partie de baseball. Proche, bon, pas cher."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing a BP, but I went today with my parents before going to see a movie. Service was super kind and not in the usual obnoxious chain service way, but genuine and nice. I ordered off the healthy choices menu, a pizza with an asian chicken flavour. The portion size was more in line with what true real portions should be. My pizza had around 660cals, obviously not the healthiest meal in the world, but a whole lot closer to what the ideal is! I'm happy to know Boston PIzza has genuinely tasty healthy options."}
{"text":"Repas ordinaire, par contre bon service! Si je reviens pour déguster une bonne pizza... Du tout... J'ai pas aimé"}
{"text":"Currently at this location and food is sub-par in comparison to the Progress location. I usually order the same thing, The Chipotle Bacon Chicken Club. This time the food was very dry and they didnt offer any side sauces for the fries, my dad ordered the Steak Sandwich which was a thick cut of steak, sandwiched between 2 thick dry slices of bread. He ordered medium rare but stated that it was dry and lacked flavor. It was also virtually impossible to bite through and he had to take the sandwich apart and eat the bread alongside the steak. The handcrafted quenchers also taste horrible. I mean, if you like the medicine, carbonated water/artificial alcohol flavor this might be the drink for you. However, I had to switch it out for a normal soft drink and the waitress politely obliged. The service is great, the staff is very friendly and accommodating but sadly that doesn't make up for the lack in quality in food. The desert was delicious as always yet you can never go wrong with desert or I'd really be questioning the consistency between establishments. I do not reccomend this location. Drive an extra 10 or 15 minutes and make your way to the Progress location."}
{"text":"I often come here with friends and family for lunch dates after we realized they offer a \"discounted\" lunch menu. The prices here are relatively fair, the food is great quality and the service is average. However, the consistency in food gets a little risky from dish to dish and you might become hesitant to be adventurous and explore the menu. I usually only ever order the same thing or order what I know a friend or family has already tried since I've personally had a couple hit or miss. I highly reccomend the Chipotle Chicken Club with your choice of side. It's juicy and packs a ton of flavor (its the bacon and Chipotle sauce). If you need something to quench your thirst and youre with a group of friends the pitcher of Red Sangria is the way to go (serves about 6 glasses). You can't go wrong with any items on the desert menu. My personal favorite is the Panookie or the Chocolate brownie. They're both rich, and decadent and will most definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. They're also good for sharing. The establishment is clean, nice or average eating area/seating, staff is friendly, helpful and hospitable. This location is worth a try."}
{"text":"BP's always brings back memories of a younger Arc when I had little funds, but felt like congregating to some place late at night with friends for some cheap eats, perfect after a night of over-priced and watered down drinking trying to chase ladies I never had a chance with. Those were the days!

I went here for Pasta Tuesday where they have their \"gourmet pastas\" for less than $10.  I ordered a Jambalaya Fettuccine baked in cheese, which was an additional $2.79 (or something like that). So let's break it down.

Outstanding service. Our server was excellent. She made some recommendations about the pasta's she had tried. I appreciated her taking the time to give her opinion. She remembered to hold the green onions for my table. You'd be surprised how servers, even higher end restaurants, forget something like this. She constantly was checking up on us. And she did it in a non-intrusive way, even apologizing for interrupting.

Food-wise, it was mediocre. The pasta was a little hard. Also, the sauce was kind of flavorless. And the sausage could of been more inspired. Volume-wise it was satisfying.

All-in-all it was an OK experience. Though it wouldn't be my first choice for a restaurant, I would likely come back to BP's in the distant future."}
{"text":"Even better than bass pro shops, the best place in the world. Papa bless this amazing restaurant also the smash sangria pitcher is sooooooOoooo good. Go every single day. Food and service was not good and also bad but this is the most glorious place on God's green earth."}
{"text":"Just stay away. My party visited and had pizza and pasta. My dish was totally uninspiring. Positively bland. Service was poor too."}
{"text":"We went there on July 30 at 6 ish and got told by greeters, my party of three, they could serve us, if we could be out within an hour because a large party was coming and taking over the restaurant.  They did not suggest to go into the lounge. We left. Our evening was almost ruined but decided to go to a pub in Midnapore. It was excellent choice.  If your restaurant is going to be closed for a private event, then post a note on the door. We did not have to go in there to hear this.  We chose this place because had 1 good and one half good experience there."}
{"text":"My friends and I grabbed dinner here for the holidays. They took reservations which was very useful. The food was okay, I ordered a ravioli dish but it didn't really wow me or anything. It's a nice atmosphere and the top floor looks really cool. It's convenient for students because of their discount (I think it was about 10% off). However it was really hard to grab our server's attention with it being a steady night, and he wasn't communicative about certain food items costing extra (like substitutions and certain breads) so my friends were surprised at the bill.

But overall, their staff are very kind and social and they made sure we were having a good time! It's a good place to casually catch up and watch sports with a group, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, finally doing a review. If  you love chewy tasty crispy crust pizza, this is the place.  I love their Boston Special.  My co-workers love their extensive menu of non-pizza items, i.e. spicy wings, steak & cheese sandwiches, burgers and salads.  The owner greets her regulars by first name and, often remembers their favorite items (...pretty impressive.)  And, if there's ever a problem, they quickly redo the order.  I saw the reviews on their location, but it's really not a bad location.  Its a quiet area between Freemont and the Las Vegas Strip and a few blocks away from 4 federal buildings and a SLEW of legal offices. Still on Las Vehas Blvd.   It's a \"whole in the wall\" pizza place.  Who doesn't like a great whole-in-the-wall place to eat.  Go, venture away from the norm and enjoy great pizza... and COURTEOUS service."}
{"text":"I can't decide if Boston Pizza is wonderful or if it's the devil. When we first moved downtown, almost two years ago, it was fantastic. I really loved the crust on their pizza and there's a ton of sauce on it. Delivery was prompt and always correct.

In the last six or eight months, something changed. The crust tastes like Domino's now (not good) and the last two times I've had their delivery, it's been incorrect. And slow. I do like their two-fer Tuesdays but not enough to have them screw up the rest of the meal I order (usually a meatball sub and an order of onion rings).

I like that their onion rings are battered rather than breaded. They're so good! 

If the rest of the food and the delivery keeps going downhill, though, we'll become regulars of Albo's instead. Win me back, Boston Pizza - I really want to like you again!"}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order online for 7:15pm. Arrived on time but was told our order would take another 15 minutes. What's the point of selecting a pick up time if we still have to wait????"}
{"text":"Came to a pizza chain and had the Greek chicken salad. Very good with fresh lettuce and vegetables. As good as any salad or a better than most chains. The waitress was prompt and attentive.  I am on the BP bar side rather than the restaurant and it is every bit a sports bar. Next time I'll try the pizza."}
{"text":"Met a colleague for light dinner last night at BP.  We shared the jambalaya linguine which would have been quite nice if it had been served hot.  It was a slow nite (everyone must have been home watching the Jays win) there were only four other tables seated so can't imagine why our food was cold.  When we mentioned it to our server (who was very pleasant and attentive), she took it back to the kitchen to have it warmed up - came back tepid.  By then we were so hungry we ate it as is.  We told her again and specifically asked her to let the kitchen know. And that was the end of it. No apology, nothing. I live within walking distance of this BP but given all the other restaurant options in the neighbourhood, it will be a long time before I go back - if ever."}
{"text":"We went to this location in August for dinner. Very loud sports bar atmosphere; with TVs turned up loud and lots of loud customers.
Sever was friendly chatting much for that tip. 
We ordered half size Nachos no protein at a whopping $14 a medium Hawaiian at a whopping $23. The food came out in a reasonable time, which is good.
The Nachos were cheesy and loaded with Jalapeños; as the peppers took away much of the enjoyment of enjoying the app. Nachos were not fresh nor very crunchy.
The pizza was not great as cheap mediocre ham and crappy pineapple from a can is used for the pizza. Not worth the price. We won't be back"}
{"text":"We visited this location on February 18th, 2018. We were promptly showed to our table.
Our server was Ramez and he took our drink order and appetizer at that moment. 
We ordered a single order of double baked BBQ wings and a deluxe pizza. 
Ramez returned with our drinks and advised the app will take about 10 mins. He returned shortly with our wings and advised the pizza will be along 8-10 mins. 
Our pizza came out before we had finished our app which was ok but it started to get cold. 
Observations:
1. We didn't get new plates after the app and had to put our pizza on same plate with wing bones. Bit annoying. 
2. The wings were supposed to be double baked, but seemed underdone and the overall taste and texture was not appetizing. 
3. I had to beckon Ramez several times for my drink refills.
4. Ramez is friendly but needs to be more attentive to the tables he's serving. 
5. The prices are a bit steep for the mediocre taste and poor presentation."}
{"text":"Slow service.  They seated us in an area that was feezing cold.  Too noisy for children. 
On the bright side, the wings were awesome. 
Halal pizza options are a great choice too. 
I would go there again but maybe choose a different seating area."}
{"text":"I got the Rib-Winger combo when I came here with a couple of friends. It was quite the mountain of food but you definitely pay for what you get. It's a pretty chill spot if you want to catch up with a couple of friends because they do take their time with the service. It took us about 10 or so minutes just to get the bill and go. The food was decent overall, but this place is definitely not for you if you're looking to quickly eat and go."}
{"text":"If you go, don't look at the nutrition stats. 

Lots of TVs around. Not a destination place for the food. 

Overall Meh."}
{"text":"A Vegas hidden gem.  Solid cheesesteaks (not fantastic, but ok), okay pizza...solid wings...and if you go late, the strippers from the place next door come in after their shift to chow down.  Probably should be 3 stars, but I've had too many good times here to rank it less than 4."}
{"text":"Got delivery for their Canada day sale. 

I have to say their regular pizzas aren't that bad just like I remember years back. Although my visit was subpar and the service was quite slow. I got delivery this time and was actually delivered a pizza in a very quick time. I'd guess 25 minutes, maybe 30. Although I do live a block away from them. 

The pizza was cooked well and had a generous amount of toppings. One thing though is they didn't add enough pizza sauce. I should have asked for more, will remember for next time. Second thing is they didn't put the toppings all over the pizza. Some slices were missing a significant amount of toppings versus the rest of the pizza. Cheese was great, toppings tasted good although I would have thought they'd be a bit more fresh. Tasted more like processed toppings. Can't complain though it was still good. 

They gave a good amount of side toppings, 3 containers of each chilli peppers and Parmesan cheese. Also had plenty of napkins and 3 hand wipes for after eating. I will definitely order delivery again."}
{"text":"Good place to go.

Many of the things here are not healthy, as the other reviewer says, but many are as well.

Case in point?  How many places do YOU know that serve oven-baked chicken wings?  This is the main reason why we head there...my friends love wings, but I don't eat the deep-fried ones you find almost everywhere.

I also had their pizza pockets (I forget what they're called-stromboli or something?), and together with a side of salad, make for a tasty, and even reasonably-healthy meal.

I also really like their bruschettas.

although this isn't a great restaurant, at the price, it IS great.  

Comfy seats, generally-clean, and has an outside seating area."}
{"text":"The take out service/order took 30 minutes to be given. This is too long for a chicken/mushroom pasta."}
{"text":"Decided to give BP another try since I had a free thin crust pizza coupon.

The service here is much better compared to the Major Mac location. The waitresses are a lot more energetic and enthusiastic.

The food took around half an hour to come. 

The Primavera Penne was a part of the lunch combo special for $10. It came with a choice of a side, we chose chicken noodle soup. The pasta was super spicy. We weren't expecting something quite as spicy. The chicken noodle soup was like canned soup and it was pretty salty.

For the thin crust pizza we ordered the pizza bella. This pizza had smoked prosciutto, peppery arugula, mozzarella and parmesan cheese. This was super crispy, very cheesy and fresh! I wish the prosciutto was in smaller pieces because its pretty chewy and very hard to bite a small amount with each bite of the pizza (the entire piece of prosciutto would come off in one bite). 

The pizza was great, the pasta not so much."}
{"text":"The hostess was extremely quiet - I could barely hear her. She sounded very shy when she asked if we wanted to sit in the bar/dining room and which type of table we wanted. 

The waitress was very nice, but the manager/supervisor was kind of rude. While we were eating she came around asking why we didn't try the new thin pizzas in a very rude tone. 

Half of the cutlery wrapped in napkins we got were missing the forks. 

The food is very overpriced and not very good.

The garlic shrimp pasta was super soft and overcooked. It was also pretty tasteless. I think they forgot to add salt.

The back ribs was overcooked. The meat will fall off even without cutting the ribs.

The pizza was good, but definitely not worth $32.99. I'm sure I can get something equally as good for half the price elsewhere.

The chicken from the salad was surprisingly good. Very hot and crunchy. There were also lots of toppings. But wwwwaaayyyyyyy to much dressing. 

Both the bbq and mild wings were too sour. 

The pizza bread and fettuccine were average. Nothing special.

Boston Pizza needs to seriously improve their food and service."}
{"text":"The spicy burger was really good.  Great flavor and it actually has a spicy taste to it not like some burgers say spicy but has no spice to it.  The fries are good.  If you looking for fast or good service well that's another story.  Less 1 star for service."}
{"text":"I've visited this location twice. Both times, the service was surprisingly slow, considering it wasn't very crowded at all. 

The pasta was a bit above average quality, and the portions were fairly large, but it was very overpriced. I paid around $20 for my pasta before tax and tip, and for that much money I could have just went to a buffet. The price would have been justified, if the pasta was amazing, which it wasn't. 

Their pizza was also overpriced, and of below average quality. I can't recall what size I bought, but it was around $16 and it wasn't filling at all, and I could have gone to my local $5 pizza place and had a medium pizza of better quality. It definitely wasn't a $16 pizza; it tasted like they had spread the sauce too thin, and it lacked any sort of flavor.

I will not be visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"overall, the worst part of this restaurant is the service. you can almost never see servers around and it would probably take you around 20 minutes to flag one down. they're all usually just lingering around not doing anything. 
I was with a party of 8 and the lady took all our orders by memory and when she called it back to us, she got a couple wrong so we needed to correct her.....like is it too much to just write it down? after I got my bill, she charged me the wrong amount (there were 2 sizes) and after I told her, she argued with me and said that I was the one who was wrong and that she didn't hear me say that I wanted the smaller size. 
I have eaten the smaller size before so I knew for a fact that I was eating the cheaper size, which is almost $10 cheaper than what she charged me! so when I asked again, she looked extremely insulted and bought the two plates with the two sizes out to show me. turns out I WAS RIGHT and she did take the right order and charged the wrong amount!! does she not know what each size looks like?"}
{"text":"It was the worst service ever. We waited for 10 min the had to actually call for a waitress. There were 9 waitresses all walking around in a daze not knowing what to do. It was busy but still... Not impressed"}
{"text":"Three and a half star they didn't tell me that they charge for delivery, never mind I could surpass that but than she suggested my husband order butter chicken pizza it's just awesome. Let me tell you I was very hungry so don't have pic to share but every slice had one little tini tiny piece of chicken n I felt so lucky when I found two pieces on 1 slice, total bull in their preparation and medium pizza was for $25 so plz do put some chicken when you make next butter chicken pizza..."}
{"text":"It's a terrible experience to me! I had dinner there alone two days ago, there was no one service me!!!! Very slow!!!  Noisy environment!!! And the server who named Parker is very rude, I don't know why the restaurant hire such a person to be server!!! I was so disappointed. Will never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"The soup was cold. The sides on the menu did not match what was served. The steam vegetables were terrible. If you are a wine drinker don't even bother."}
{"text":"We know Boston Pizza well, and it was within walking distance from the hotel.  There were other options such as Montana's, Jack Astor's and the Chop House, but we were a little under dressed for some of those and we wanted something relatively quick.

I don't normally review chain restaurants, unless it is one I have never been to before or a new location which this was.  If you've been to Boston Pizza then you know what to expect.  This was not a bad visit, but we tried the pizza burger, and although it was good it would not be something I'd order again.  

here we were slightly disappointed was with the salad, which came out without croutons, and little if any dressing on it.  Unfortunately when the server came out, we had not yet tried it so couldn't comment at the time but we both looked at each other when it came out like WTF?  Before she brought the bill, and asked if we wanted something else, I did mention that I had a small complaint for the manager regarding the salad, and it not being what we had come to expect.  She asked if we wanted another one, and because I am always leery about making complaints when it comes to my food (I've seen the movie Waiting and things they do) so I said no, but Karen said yes so we let them make amends.  It didn't take long before we had our replacement, and it was much improved.  She did say though that apparently somebody else had ordered theirs without croutons and dressing on the side, so it was likely just a mix-up and we got someone else's order.  Too many times though I read reviews of people complaining, but I never hear them say they mention it to the establishment.  

This was an opportunity for people to see that if you do complain, you can give them a chance to fix it and they were very good about it."}
{"text":"I usually get good quality food and service from this location. What disappointed me today is that my order was messed up. I provided the manager with positive feedback and explained what was wrong with my order. What disappointed me was that he did not offer a credit. I've worked in the restaurant industry and that is how we would deal with a messed up order. Especially when the patron is polite."}
{"text":"When I look at this place, I see an attitude that screams \"just good enough\".

There's no attempt to set yourself apart, no real motivation to deliver great service. Just a group of employees who are content to just skate by and let things happen outside their control, without any sort of pride in their work.

I came here with a group of friends after a stellar dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in order to catch the tail-end of a UFC pay-per-view. I was disappointed by the lack of service. We walked in there around 12:30 and found a bunch of people hanging out in the bar ogling the waitresses, and a scattered group of people in the dining room who are looked either bored or angry.

When we sat down, it was quickly clear why. Even the waitresses were distracted and roaming around, doing lots of walking but no actual serving. The waitress we had disappeared for a solid half-hour before coming back and asking for drink orders, despite being near us the entire time and staring transfixed at the fight.

The beer was fine. We all had the Saturday special ($6 Stella pints), but that's the bare minimum I expect when I go anywhere. Serving it cold doesn't make you stand out from any other restaurant.

The biggest problem I can see are the servers themselves. All of the female waitresses, down to a T (including someone who I believe is the manager), strut around in miniskirts but seem to have very little knowledge of the menu or virtually anything else. I can't tell if this place is trying to compete with the Tilted Kilt down the road, but the service is sorely lacking at this Boston Pizza.

I now realize why I haven't visited this place before, and why I'm unlikely to go back. It's a total frat zone, filled with people who appeal to base sensibilities and no real care put into anything. 

Can't say I was that impressed with the experience, and I'm finding that more and more with Boston Pizza these days."}
{"text":"(Delivery) Pretty good first time order from Boston Pizza!  Delivery was reasonably quick and food arrived hot with all the trimmings (thanks, I like ketchup packets with my fries).  Ordered the \"8\" Cheese Steak (beef) with Everything\" with a side of french fries and a soda.  Cheese Steak was very good, the beef was seasoned well and the melted American Cheese worked.  I would skip the lettuce/tomato they add though, go with the regular Cheese Steak.  Good roll.  Hey it's not the one you find in Philadelphia (never had one close to theirs in Las Vegas) but it works.  Would order from again, they seem to have a big menu."}
{"text":"Typical Boston Pizza. Good bar food and their drink deals are better than most places. The schooner is a good price and Saturday and Sunday are fishbowls for 7.50. Worth it to go watch a fight or game."}
{"text":"I visited with my family for a great pizza. It took the server 10 minutes to give us a seat even though about 1/3 of the restaurant was empty.
We ordered the original pizza with some fries. Curiously enough, both dishes came in only moderately warm. They cooled down pretty quickly and we were about to eat cold pizza. Thankfully a server warmed it for us so we could enjoy it. Even though I had some issues with the overall experience, the great service bumped my rating up to 4-star. I wouldn't mind coming back if I feel like Boston Pizza again."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok a little salty. They don't sell slices. It was walking distance from hotel. For the time we went 1:00am can't be choosy. The customer service was great. I would recommend only if you don't have any other options."}
{"text":"Expensive. The food was not worth how much it cost. Rather than average, I would say that the food is disappointing just because of the price. Otherwise, their pizza is ok.

The server is nice, and that's pretty much the highlight of my experience at this restaurant. The interior is roomy for two, so that's good. There's not much to say about the interior design since it's a pretty typical family friendly setting where you can catch your game while having a meal and drink."}
{"text":"One of the go-to spots my friends and I hang out at, when we can be bothered to agree on a time and day.

The last time I was here (a few weeks back), my friends ate shawarma from Osmow's on the patio while a couple friends and I stood lookout. They have very friendly security guards.

This BP location has a very large, almost cavernous, feel to it. Lots of signed memorabilia on the walls, big-screen TVs, the usual. Food is hit-and-miss - can't say I enjoy the pizza too much, but as a stopover point for drinks, it gets the job done.

It's worth checking out at least once if you're at the nearby AMC Courtneypark to see a movie, but don't go out of your way to visit it.

(I just realized that might be the most non-committal review I've ever written.)"}
{"text":"When I visit Toronto I find myself at this particular location a few times for sure. It's newly renovated lounge and dining side gives you a nice modern Toronto feel. Huge screens to meet your sporting needs, great service by the staff and the managers are always on point. I've particularly always seen the general manager/owner at the location to meet the needs of customers.

A must eat location if you enjoy great pizza. Recommendation: Cold beer, Steak and potato gourmet pizza on the newly renovated patio. Boom, magic!"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good and our waitress was super cute and nice.  She was a little spacey, and the service was spotty, but it was nice to sit outside and have a beer or two.  It's too damn bad that things are so expensive in Canada or I probably could have enjoyed this place a little more.  It felt like a the chain it was, but hit the spot after a long day's riding."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a couple apps and a beer must say the worst food ever!!! I've eaten here many times and have enjoyed it but wow so amazed at what this cook sent out. Took a pic of the bacon wrapped sirloin but sent back the freezer burnt calamari before I could take any pics. Pizza was good and chicken was ok only thing I can say about the chicken Thai bites was the garnish was as hard as a rock and they put raw carrots on the plate. My comp was removing the items I refused to eat off my plate and giving me a free app coupon for the next visit, I can guarantee there won't be another visit.forgot to mention service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Food quality is not as good as before. Kids meal portion is smaller now, grilled cheese is not grilled at all, it doesn't even look like its toasted, it's just white, and the size is so small. Pizza is dry and can hardly see the pizza sauce.
Staff were nice and friendly but slow. I waited for at least 20 mins for them to take my payment after they dropped off the bill(it was 6:30pm on Wed night, they weren't busy at all, only 4 tables of families there)"}
{"text":"I made reservations for my birthday; however, when arrived, they didn't have the name.  Fortunately, it was not that busy and they were able to seat us.  The food was what I expected and good place for a large group of people."}

{"text":"Servers can't tell a real driver's licence from a fake one. Refused service for my daughter who is of legal age to drink and bluntly embrassed her by telling her the ID was fake. She tried to show that the birthdate on her government Health Card was the same (She knows a health card's can't be used as ID).  Eventually, the server spoke to a manager and offered to serve, but without compensation for the embarrasment. A free dessert, discount.  They need to be smart serve certified to understand how to determine real ID from fake. Maybe, asking for another piece of ID as well to confirm the legitimacy of the birthdate. Food is overpriced."}
{"text":"Keg used to be my go to place for nachos.. they're pretty good there. But keg was closed at 10 on a Sunday evening and the only place open was BP. NACHOS WERE GREAT! my new go to place.. Sunday was also a great day to go because every daily special was in effect and for a huge loaded fresh order of BBQ chicken nachos a Caesar and a glass of wine the bill was less than 30 bucks... Don't forget to up your tip game!! Service is great!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with Boston Pizza!!! A group of friends and I stopped in yesterday for lunch. The Buy one Get one free Tuesday is the shit!!! This pizza is freshly made with amazing quality of ingredients. Sauce was on point!! Great hours if you need late night!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is huge and lot of space to sit around.... there is a lot of rush in the area due to business coming down to grab a bite to eat during lunch. The food is just like the bar food you would expect so not much... and if you been going there the menu context has not changed in years but there is a lot of variety. 

They have started to keep halal chicken, so now you can ask them to put it in any burger, pasta and pizza. So that's a good addition for people with Halal preferences. This location did have the halal option.

I was there during lunch hour with some coworkers. The service was very good, our server was nice and active to pin point us in the right direction as I was eating halal and we also had a one vegetarian in the group and no complaints there. The food was on time and atmosphere is nice.

For the meal option I went with their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. I kind of love this kick it has, it usually Breaded chicken breast but if you opt for halal meat it not breaded. The chicken is tossed in hot sauce served on a toasted French-style bun and fries on the side. 

For my Muslim brothers and sisters: They have halal option available at this location,"}
{"text":"Now a days, when people go out to eat, they are expected to pay more. No big deal. What is required in return is decent service along with a basic expectation of a meal. We just returned from dining there, and were very disappointed in both! We each had a pizza, me a medium, and her a small. On my pizza, was little to no tomato sauce. Almost non existent. The place was empty at 3:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday. I eventually was able to get some tomato sauce in a container on the side, where I would apply it myself. Not very many toppings on it either. The waitress, was slow and very seldom seen. I later spotted her sitting in the corner of the kitchen on her phone. She never came by to offer anything else or to refill or drinks. She couldn't really care less. We won't be visiting ANY Boston Pizza after this. It's not even 5% of the place that it used to be, while I was growing up; and I suspect, that they will be closing their doors to a lot of outlets in this city. Too bad really!"}

{"text":"Well this was not the 1st time I visited this Boston Pizza location.  So now I'll decide to write a review.  

As my friend and I were in the lounge waiting for the Flames-Leafs game later in the evening, we decided to have a couple of pitchers of Rickard's Dark (ah still waiting for Edmonton bars to get it), and some food.  My friend ordered a Chicken Ciabatta sandwich and I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana entrée.  

So he liked his dish, which wasn't too bad.  My order was a meal in itself.  Their new BP house dressing is kind of like an olive tapenade except less tangy.  Very delicious.  The chicken parm on the other hand was a little left to be desired.  Very thick with breading and didn't have a lot of cheese.  It came with garlic bread and some spaghetti.  I didn't get the usual pepper and cheese until I had to ask.  So that was a little bit of a turn off.  

The desserts made up for it afterwords.  I suggest if you're dessert freaks, then you should definitely try any of their desserts.  TRUST ME!!!

All in all, if you're looking for a nice night out, watching a sporting event with the boys, or the one you love, if she's a sports fan, then definitely take some time to visit this location.  I believe it's one of the better BP locations in Canada, or at least I think so.  HAHA!!"}
{"text":"We usually don't do chains but with a zoo pass we decided to try it out. The place is literally surrounded with televisions, dark interior, food was very standard, but quick service which is helpful with children. However when it came time to pay our zoo discount was expired, so we mentioned asking the manager about it- we didn't look before we went. We were shocked at how rude and rough she was with us. We were only inquiring. the poor waitress kept apologizing, but we have never been treated in such a way at any sit down restaurant. It turned an otherwise mediocre meal into a never again experience."}
{"text":"Can I give less than one star?  As soon as we walked in it smelled like manure. Should of left. We didn't. Steak was burnt!  Recooked and it was raw. Ladies bathroom out of service. So they sent me and my little girls through the lounge to the bar bathroom. It was DISGUSTING!  I will never go back."}
{"text":"The odds are you've heard about or been in a Boston Pizza if you've eaten pizza in eastern Canada, there are literally hundreds of locations throughout Canada and it seems from my recent visit to this location across from Rogers Centre, originally named the SkyDome home of the Toronto Bluejays it is very popular amongst the locals. Although this was my first visit to any BP I can't imagine any location being bigger than this one. This two story restaurant has a large dining area downstairs and a full service bar and dining area upstairs.

We chose to climb the stairs and found a seat in the bar area, we were greeted by the bartender who was very friendly, he took our drink orders and gave us a brief rundown of the menu items and made some recommendations since we weren't looking to eat pizza. 

Thai Chili Shrimp - spicy with a hint of sweetness a nice appetizer 

Dry Rubbed Pepper Ribs - no sauce riblets, tasty but there are small bones fragments present (not a deal break but just be aware)

The pours were very good and our bartender provided excellent service throughout our visit - the Bluejays game was just ending and the place filled to capacity rather quickly fortunately we were seated and served prior to the crowd arriving. Nothing bad here but nothing special either it's was what we expected..."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in Vegas! I stop here every trip and am never disappointed. Sketchy surroundings but it's all good! Open late too which makes life so much easier!"}
{"text":"I visited Boston Pizza with a few friends on a Monday evening, and was pleasantly surprised by this place. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but as a frequent pizza eater, I normally don't like to go to this sort of place, where normally you'll pay twice as much for a pizza that's about the same quality and taste as anywhere else. 
That said, I quite enjoyed my pizza. Even the crust. At $15 for a small pepperoni, I would hope I'd enjoy it, but I really don't have any complaints! 
To help offset the price of the pizza though, I found they have a great beer special on Mondays (at least - could be other days of the week as well). They offered their Schooner (32oz) up for $7.99. I believe they only had a couple of choices at that price. Coor's Light, Canadian, and maybe one other, but I'm not picky as long as it's cold, and I really enjoyed my large beer with my small pizza. 
The restaurant itself was nice and clean and quiet, and our server was friendly and efficient. And everyone in my party said they thoroughly enjoyed their food and their drinks. I think we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is huge and lot of space to sit around. The food is just like the bar food you would expect so not much... and if you been going there the menu hasn't changed much in years. 

Although they have started to keep halal chicken now so you can ask them to put it in any burger, pasta and pizza. 

For this time we went there for office lunch and about 6 of us ordered at the same time and my food came very late and everyone else was nearly don't with there food, but the server was nice enough to not charge be for swallowing my food as I didn't have time to enjoy it."}
{"text":"The restaurant is huge and lot of space to sit around as its part of the Courtney Park plaze.... there is a lot of rush in the area due to theatres. The food is just like the bar food you would expect so not much... and if you been going there the menu hasn't changed much in years. 

Although they have started to keep halal chicken now so you can ask them to put it in any burger, pasta and pizza. So thats a good addition for people with Halal preferences.

I been going there to celebrate after every CGA exam we finish as we do it close by. The service has always been good and no complaints there. The food is not delayed and atmosphere is nice.

This time they were have renovations so there main entrance is closed... there is a small not visible sign on one of the side door... so make sure you go there."}
{"text":"I ate here earlier this evening. Food was not good so they took a few of my items off the bill but I left hungry. I now have food poisoning and I believe it was due to the spinach dip which tasted terrible. If only you could give 0 stars. Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Waited several minutes for a host or hostess so I could be seated. No one ever showed up despite signs indicating one should wait to be seated. The entrance is too cold to wait very long. I don't think I'll bother trying again."}
{"text":"Totally happy with the delivery service. We have ordered from this location a few times and the delivery is fast, food is hot and the delivery people are extremely friendly and go above and beyond to be enthusiastic and provide great service! The food is delicious! Good quality reusable containers to keep as well, well worth the price. Thanks BP!"}
{"text":"We tried ordering from here but they wouldn't let us in that no one would pick up ever when we called...which was at least 5 times over a 30 min period. Oh well."}
{"text":"Went there during lunch hour, was my first BP experience, and it was not very good.

The service was pretty much nonexistent, the waitress never fill my water until the very end, and she had quite some attitude as well. The table was not properly cleaned and had bits of melted cheese stuck on the table.

We had the Baked Taco Beef Penne and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. The pasta tasted alright and the portion was fair, I wish there was more sour cream on the top.

The pizza, on the other hand, was just ridiculous. I mean, the restaurant's name is Boston PIZZA, right? They're suppose to be famous and known for their pizza, RIGHT?

Oh boy that \"thing\" was disappointing. First of all, they were out on multigrain crust, what kind of place with Pizza in its name goes out of pizza crust??? Second of all, that \"pizza\" had only a very thin layer of cheese with very thick crust, I think they were short on BBQ sauce as well, as the \"pizza\" had almost no taste. It is also hard to believe that, for such a small portion, the \"pizza\" came with no other garnishes, salads, or sides (not even the choice of having such things). They should name their pizza \"cheesy bread\" instead.

I do have to admit that their mint candy tasted absolutely fantastic, I love that candy!

I may come back one day just for that candy.

Nah I won't."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is reasonable for their prices, and i didn't have a problem at this location.

We went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, and the patio was completely bare.

I appreciate the large screen playing FIFA!

I ordered the Sante Fe Salad, and it was a large portion and the ingredients tasted fresh enough.

But i wouldn't recommend the shrimp skewer, which is what I ordered for $5 extra, because they are TINY!

All in all, friendly waitress and a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing !!! This is one Boston Pizza that I would say is great in Toronto!! Not only is it good, it has halal options!! I had the bender bread, Mediterranean pizza, chicken tacos, and chicken wings. Everything was absolutely amazing that I would not mind having it right now!! The place is cozy, chilled atmosphere, clean and just a good hang out place!"}
{"text":"I gave this one star because yelp doesn't allow you to give 0 stars. Its sad to see a reputable brand like BP turned into this.

The decor was good overall with comfortable seating. Would be a nice place to catch a game if your ordering just beer. Don't even think about ordering their food.

The pizza, over-salted dough with toppings that would make pizza pizza seems premium.

The pasta, over cooked noodles with microwaved meat balls. Not sure if the chefs were trying to make baby food, but you certainly did not need teeth to eat the noodles. This is not the worst part! They were stingy on the sauce!! have of the pasta did not have sauce on it.

The chicken salad was the best part of the meal. It could be better if the sauce was there, or the lettuce was less than 5 days old. 

Overall, don't come here for the food or cocktails. If you just like a beer during a raptors game, then this is your spot. For anything else lots of options around here."}
{"text":"What an unbelievably awful experience I had with this Boston pizza this evening, i ordered 1 medium cheese pizza and the boy on the phone said it would take about 45 minutes to an hour to arrive. I gave him my address and phone number. An hour passed and I called back and asked how much longer the wait would be, the same boy on the phone said \"the driver phoned you when he got there and knocked on the door and know one answered the door or the phone\". I was surprised he lied to me, I live in an apartment building and was expecting a call when the delivery guy was outside to ask for a buzzer number, I didn't get a phone call from the driver and he definitely was not at my door. Then the boy on the phone tried telling me he tried calling me also. I asked him to read me the phone number he had written down and it was the correct number. He said he was sending a driver to deliver my pizza and it would take about 15 minutes. About 20 minutes later my pizza was delivered by a man and I asked him if he was the one who was supposed to deliver the pizza first, he said no, he was supposed to be finished his shift and the other driver asked him to deliver it for him\". The man who delivered the pizza apologized many times about some one else's mistakes and gave me his managers number and name. I honestly hope that kid who lied gets fired, I'm sure there are 100's of honest people out there that would love a job and do it right and would most likely not get other employes to do there job for them."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pourtant pas la première fois que je vais au Boston Pizza, mais c'est maintenant que je me décide à faire un avis.

Les menus du midi valent la peine puisque peu chers et avantageux : salade et café sont inclus. Mais question santé on y repassera (aucun choix santé sur les menus express, ça fait dur !) . En parlant du menu express.. 25 minutes pour se faire servir une pizza c'est un peu long, surtout lorsque le restaurant est quasi vide...

Bon, fini le chiâlage, parlons des bons points ;) Le menu renferme des choix santés identifiés par un crochet et qui nous informe sur les calories et autre éléments nutritionnels du plat. Bonne idée ! Sinon, un éventail de pizzas délicieuses, des ribs, des pâtes, des entrées délicieuses, des salades gourmet, alouette ! mention spéciale à la tarte au sucre...mmmm

Dans le genre de resto-bar sportifs, Boston Pizza surpasse les autres et de loin."}
{"text":"Hmm... Not impressed with the place.. Very slow service... It was during the week around 9 and place wasn't even busy..
The food wasn't great either... 
I ordered sliders , which I got maybe 15 min late. Everybody else were almost done with their food.
 I think I will try a different place next time.."}
{"text":"This is a good example of a restaurant that has expanded its menu beyond its level of competence. Great pizza, lousy just about everything else on the menu. When the exorbitantly priced salmon arrived well done and hard to chew, even though I explicitly asked for it to be medium rare, the explanation was \"we have to cook it this way\".  To the restaurant's credit they took it off the bill."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for lunch during your shopping excursion, or just to get away from the Christmas shoppers. If you know what I mean. 
We sit in the bar area in the back from the mall entrance the front is usually full of families with young children .  
The service from the waitresses is fantastic and the food comes to the table hot. 
We had the weekday $10.00 special to share with a few happy juice to relax us. LOL
This restaurant is located by the food court of CrossIron Mills and parking is plentiful. 
This place is definitely a go to place when we're in the mall."}
{"text":"We have been there many times over the years and never wrote a review until now.  We have never had bad service or food.  Now, normally we go to the bar side of BP's. We go there during the week for a early share lunch.  We love the  $10.00 specials they have Monday thru Friday's.  
We were there Friday and had a wonderful BBQ chicken pizza with a side of cheesy pizza bread with bologna sauce with a few beers and a sissy drink called twisted rocket I think?  The drink looked good but the taste was not there. (Will not order that sissy drink again) Pizza was yummy and was temperature very hot had to let cool. 

Like any restaurant it can be a hit or miss depends on how busy the place is.  

Parking is normally not an issue, could be more on Friday or Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"Today I tried the new pizza burger. It combines two of my favourite foods, and the pictures made it look like something that was right up my alley, but as is often the case, the real thing didn't live up to the picture. The main reason is the burger patty, the taste and texture of which I found lacking.

Other than that, they have good pizza (though their multi-grain crust is rather bland), and my favourite chocolate cake.

A bit over-priced."}
{"text":"First time at this BP. Service was very slow, only 8 tables in the restaurant and it took 10 minutes for the server to come to our table. Server was not around to get refills on drinks. Food was average, I have had better for the price. Maybe the owner should attend to his restaurants instead of TV. This restaurant was slow for a Saturday night. I guess that tells it all. 

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here right now in Boston Pizza with my empty glass of Lemonade that's been empty for the past 15 minutes.  Empty, dirty dishes sitting here for the same time.  I had to reach across the table to grab my son's ice cream.  They usually present it to the kids but don't know what happened this time.  Oh, but she remembered to bring the bill right away.  Truly lacking in service.  I would rather pay more to have a better experience."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, you're in Scarborough, there aren't a lot of ritzy independent pizza joints to try like there are in Toronto's Little Italy or Corsa Italia so if you're craving pizza and in the area, this just may be the option.

This Boston Pizza is like every other Boston Pizza.

They have a nice patio for the summer and the bar/patio staff are friendly, attractive and provide good service. The couple times we've been here with 20+ people to sit in their dining room they've messed up pretty badly (food arriving at totally different times, forgotten orders, etc.) but in a normal sized group we've always left content. 

This particular Boston Pizza is located in one of those big box store strip mall parking lots."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza the restaurant gets 2 stars. Boston Pizza the biggest patio in the Yonge and Eg area gets 3 stars if all you're doing is drinking draft beer.

In the winter, apart from UFC fights, this place has always been pretty dead when we've been here to drink and watch a game.

The bathrooms are disgusting, the women's reek of urine and have paper towel all over the floor all night long and the men's have no paper towel starting at about 6pm continuing on until midnight (in other words no one checks those bathrooms ever, it seems).  

In the summer, spring and fall the patio in the back is great. There are couches, televisions and heat lamps. It's big and it gets some sun. There is also a small patio on Eglinton too.

Some of their pizzas are pretty good but don't let anyone talk you into ordering the perogie pizza, it's bland flavourless and a waste of your time. I have no idea how this was recommended to us.

In short, they have a GREAT patio...don't go here for any other reason than that."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, incompetent staff. I will never return.
Ordered some take out, there was some confusion during ordering since the hostess was new and still getting trained. The manager steps in to fix things, as we are leaving she comes out with the first desert. Assuming we already have everything we said no, we switched to ice cream, big mistake, we only got one of the two. But this was not the worst part, the worst part when I called the restaurant and the hostess was trying to put the manager on the phone but he would not take the call. 
That right there speaks volumes about this place, a manager who will not speak to a customer is a clear indication of what you can expect in terms of service. If the manager dies not set the standard, the staff will simply do whatever they feel like."}
{"text":"Tried a few Boston pizza and the food is good but the experience is never the same from one place to another.
The place was pretty busy and they ended up placing us on the bar side.
A game hockey was on so it was pretty loud and the service was really slow.
We started with a few drinks and they were very good.
We all had the classic burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was very juicy and tasty and the portion was huge.
We had two different waitress and even with 2 it took forever to get the bills."}
{"text":"Great seafood pasta and flatbread Blt pizza According to previous reviews we didn't order ribs so can't tell if it is good Our food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Took them 3 hours to deliver my food, it was cold and soggy when it did arrive. I phoned and spoke to the manager, she offered to give me a gift card for the value of the food, and suggested I reheat my food. 
After agreeing to deliver fresh food in a timely manner and still provide a gift card, there was no gift card and I waited 4 hours to eat. 
I will never return and I will forever tell everyone I know about my experience. There is no real customer service here, just twits who don't know how to do their job.  I would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Ordered around midnight small order of pizza and wings, I was told 45 minutes to a hour at most. 1:30 hit and I call they told me the guy just walked out the door with 3 deliveries AKA it can take another 45 I cancel the order and will never order from here again"}
{"text":"My husband just phoned me after a terrible meal at this BP location and asked that I write a review on his behalf.

He and his friend ordered a large pizza (not extra large) with ham, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes and pineapple.  First of all, the pizza arrived cold.  On top of the fresh tomatoes was cold pineapple.  When we order pizza with pineapple, the pineapple is almost always placed under the cheese and, if not, at least it is heated on top of the pizza.  The pineapple was obviously an afterthought.  For drinks, his friend had a beer and he had a soda, of which the server charged him double when she refilled his glass.  The total came to $57 without the tip, which my husband felt was a complete and total ripoff.    

I see by another reviewer that he also had cold food.  This problem is obviously something the restaurant needs to look into."}
{"text":"Nicole our server was warm and friendly.  She was super nice!!

The menu selection is awesome, food is great!!

Pizza burger was an explosion of flavors!!!"}
{"text":"The hamburger was very good but what came as a surprise was the honey dipped fried chicken, wow!!! So amazing and tasty. I ate the whole thing. Bravo to the chef! Fast delivery, friendly driver, good prices, definitely going to order from here again"}
{"text":"Literally popped in here close to closing time to eat because I was so hungry. 

we were seated right away in the dining area because we didn't have ID's for the bar.. odd enough we still got served alcohol. annoying but was the security's fault not the servers. 

our order was promptly taken. we ordered a medium Italian pizza, I had a glass of wine and he had a mini pitcher of beer.

We were dealing with Hannah and the manager on duty and both were very pleasant, polite and funny! 

our bill was over $50 so they told us about the gift card special where we can buy a $50 card and get $10 off our next visit. totally appreciated that."}
{"text":"I was here last night for dinner.

this use to be my go-to spot when it opened,many many years ago. I can say it's been a few years since I've been to this location and the bars definitely been renovated from how I remember it. 

We sat on the patio and were served relatively quickly. I had no complaints about the service but nothing that was beyond outstanding either. She did her job.

As I was with an individual that use to work for a BP, we weren't impressed with the food. We got the low calorie pasta and veggie burger. The burger wasn't great - the bun was overly flakey and looked stale. the pasta was ok, I've had the same pasta taste better at a different location. 

I'd only come back if this was the only restaurant open in the plaza, as a last choice option for something other than fast food."}
{"text":"My family's go to restaurant in the city for a quick bite to eat is Boston Pizza. This one is the one we generally avoid if we're in a rush. It's hit and miss, as it is with most chains in the city but this one seems to miss more than others. Service can either be lightning fast or you can be sitting around for 20 minutes waiting for a bill. It's 50/50. 

Food is the same as every other location. Nothing fancy. Never had an issue with the food though, it  just can take forever to get there. 

My biggest beef is the unprofessional hostesses that they have. Last time I was there, we were waiting for a table to clear and a group of young teens walked in looking for a table. The table was cleared, and although we had been waiting 10 minutes as opposed to their 2, they got seated first. When we asked the hostess why, she said \"but like... they're the waiters friend! we need to sit them first\" and we walked out to the Vietnamese place a few doors down. We called the manager to talk to them about this, but never got a response. 

Haven't been back. I guess that was our final straw with this location. We used to go eat there before seeing a movie at west hills, but I think we'll be sticking with the moxies by the movie theater from now on."}
{"text":"This is the only place we order pizza from if we are too lazy to cook. Their pizza is fantastic. Their delivery is super fast (except late at night, but that's understandable). Their prices are pretty cheap as well. Love it!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Boston Pizza I've ever been to. Service here is abysmal. 

On my first occasion, hostess was not very welcoming. There was no \"hi, how are you?\" or \"welcome\", almost like a what do you want attitude. She proceeded to take us to the bar section and had informed us that there weren't any avaliable seats in the dinning room. Unfortunately, I didn't hear this part. There was a game on and a lot of people talking in the bar. Since I didn't hear her, I asked the hostess if there was any room in the dinning room. She responded in an extremely negative manner, rolling her eyes. Something you don't expect from a hostess. I was turned off by the whole situation and decided to just leave without ordering anything. Went to the Kelsey across the street instead. 

We came back again on another occasion. The place is the right across from my house and figured the first occasion was a one off. Really wasn't. Another hostess greeted us with better manners, however we had to wait almost 15 minutes for a waiter to come greet us. I had to wave down a waiter who wasn't our waiter, so he had to go find ours. Took almost 30 minutes before our order was taken. I was close to leaving before ordering a second time. My girlfriend asked for a glass of water. The glass seemed dirty as we saw floating debris in the cup. Understandable mistake. We just asked for another glass of water. I am pretty confident the waitress just took the glass to the back and came back with the exact same cup of water because the same debris was in the cup. 

Food was fine, it's Boston Pizza, but because of the service alone, I won't be coming to this BP ever again. 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Visited this location with my wife and three kids on a Friday night. The place was fairly busy, but we were seated quickly. Although the servers were fun and friendly, the overall pace of service was quite slow. The food took more than an hour to arrive, and the quality was sub-par. For a \"pizza\" place, the pizza was not very good. I know this isn't a high caliber restaurant to begin with, but we've eaten at a couple other Boston Pizza locations that were much better. Won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"I don't know what's up with the negative reviews. Called at 2am for pizza during my stay at the Fremont Hotel and the guy on the  phone was friendly and patient (I was ordering delivery off their menu from my phone). Ordered the medium meat lovers and some onion rings. It was $29 and change plus tip and was delivered in about 45 minutes just like the guy had said on the phone. Food was hot, pizza was greasy and delicious. I dinged them for soggy onion rings :( (EDIT: a friend mentioned to ask next time for fried foods on to go orders, to ask for your to go box to be kept open so the condensation doesn't mess up the food. 4.5)

After ridiculous amounts of boozing, when you cannot summon enough strength to go to a cafe or a mini mart, this is a good option."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza. Don't let the location turn you off this place has great food just getting past the steel door you'll find that it's a no nonsense place that has good food"}
{"text":"Awesome food! The pizza is always bomb dot com. I tried a cheeseburger with jalapenos and super delish, kiddos got the chicken fingers, personal pizza and onion rings, everything was great. Delivery was perfect (did add a tip) they were able to leave the food at my job's office!!!"}
{"text":"Barely edible ribs, put 2/3 of it in the garbage since it was pure fat.  Over priced, insanely.  Jim, your food sucks compared to 10 years ago."}
{"text":"So i walked in a few days ago to have a drink (TWO to be exact), and the server Jen was \"helping\" us.

she walked by us twice before she wanted to serve us. i had flag her down to get her attention.

ordered two beers for my friend and i and she's yelling across the restaurant if we want pint glasses and tall boy cans.. we said yes to both.

after my first drink in, the server came and told me by law i'm only allowed to have one drink an hour - and that they are heavily regulated by the cops and they won't be serving more than one drink an hour - EVEN though i'm not driving. then told me i don't weigh enough to have more than one beer an hour and told my friend she could have more... discrimination and sexist... i asked to speak to the manager Simone came over and she emphasized the sexist, derogatory comments that Jen stated.

What a great establishment! Never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Service is good, people is very nice.. i think price is high for  small plates. We had lunch pizza it is cheaper than normal prices but reallu we surprised because it was very small, also we drunk 2 beers, for all we paid 40 dollar, i think it is expensive..."}
{"text":"I want to give 0.5/5 rating but the lowest star rating is 1.Service is super slow ! Our servers barely came around to check on us.waited for almost 30 min to get our drinks. I go there for wed wings night and most of the time they dnt get my order right.also some of the servers are very rude.my younger sister asked for a side of ranch, the server rolled her eyes(she thought we didnt see it) what a rude way to treat a customer. Boston pizza southport is a lot better!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends after hanging out at Dave and Busters. We were all wanting some greesy food, such as burgers, wings, pizza, and fries, and decided to come here.

Didn't seem too busy when we arrived as there were multiple empty tables and chairs. We were seated, asked for our drink orders...then everything just went downhill after that. We were ready to order our food, but our original female server never came back to us. After about 20-30 minutes we saw her tell a male server to take our orders. Not too sure if he was new, but he seemed really nervous. 

It took us about an hour to receive our food. For such a long duration to wait when the restaurant is not fully booked up, I would've assumed our food would be decent. First of all, my friend's order was wrong, but he said okay to eating it. Once he tried it, him and my boyfriend's burgers were absolutely cold. 3/4 of our foods were uneatable due to it being unappetizing and cold. I ordered some wings as my meal...which didn't come until after everyone else's because they forgot to ring it in...

Can I just note there were only about 5-6 tables seated out of the whole dining room area, but it took forever for a server to come to us? We could see all the female staff servers just standing around in the office or front hostess area, but our male server was the only one seen running around. Whenever we would ask for more napkins or some dipping sauce for my wings, he would always forget...

On the way out, we could no longer wait for our server to come back with the bill because we were waiting already for another 30 minutes for it. We decided to go ask the hostess at the front if we can pay there, and the two girls were absolutely rude. They heard that we had complained to the manager about our experience, then when our server came to the front, one of the girls had the nerve to speak to him in Spanish in front of us. Even the other girl offered us a mint on the way out, but gave us bullshit attitude when my boyfriend declined the offer and just wanted to pay. 

The only reason why I'm giving this Boston Pizza a 2 rather than a 1 is because my wings turned out good and the manager provided us with a discount and one free meal because of the horrible experience. 

Probably won't be coming back to this location because of the terrible and poor quality of the food, as well as the horrible customer service that was provided."}
{"text":"Having been to this Boston Pizza a couple of times, I can honestly say that the food is consistently good and the service is as well.

The location is prime because it's right in the Dalhousie Station complex and considering it's easy to get to, it's usually pretty busy.

I'll often call ahead and place an order for pick up, swing on by on my way to the train and then come home with dinner in hand.

Now it doesn't get much better than that, does it? ;)"}
{"text":"Only reason why I didn't give it a 1 was because our waitress was nice and did a good job.  However if I wasn't driving for the past 10 hours and starving I would have left.  First as soon as we walked in hostess asked us how many I said 2 adults 2 kids 1 baby I asked if they had a car seat holder they said no just a high chair or booster I said no the baby was too small for the high chair.  So after a good 5 minutes we still did not have a table.  The restaurant was empty they had 8 people at the desk trying to figure out what table we should get I made a joking comment as to wow it takes 8 people to find a table and started to laugh.  I got a serious response of \"yes we are very busy and don't know where to put you.\"  The both we got was long but narrow and could not fit the car seat so we held my 6 month old while we at in a very tight booth.  We ordered food and when it came we asked the person who brought us the food for silverware he brought us 1 fork and 1 knife for 4 people.  I guess he thought my kids were supposed to eat their pasta with their hands.  Our food came the nachos were cold and the cheese was disgusting the salsa also tasted old.  Fish tacos tasted very fishy and was not edible.  Honestly probably will not go there again."}
{"text":"Very tasty, and priced very well too! Just a short drive from the middle of the strip is this yummy pizza. Crust isn't cripsy thin, or super fat, but just right. The cheese was a little thick for my taste, but it was darn good. We scored a medium cheese for just under $10, and that was plenty for two of us. It said online that they deliver to the strip, but then they didn't, so meh. Either way, I thought it was worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken fingers in Las Vegas! They are always super busy try to order by phone!"}
{"text":"This was the 1st time ordering from here. We ordered the Boston Special Pizza, Mozzarella Sticks and Cheesecake. I'm unsure as to why the stars are
so low. Everything tasted really good! The Mozzarella sticks have a great taste to them the batter is different from what I am used to but definitely recommended. The cheesecake has a nice creaming texture and a thick soft bottom. The pizza  had a solid taste perfect amount of toppings and cheese. I would for sure order from here again."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheese steak ever. I like mine with onions green peppers and provolone cheese. Chicken wings are amazing, fingers too! Tuesdays are busy because its their buy one get one pizzas. They get slammed. The pizza is cheesy and delicious. Get a side of ranch and dip the pizza in it...mmmmmm!!"}
{"text":"Went there twice. First time was Friday night and we waited for over an hour for food, and the pizza was soggy. Manager came out to apologize and gave us free pizza voucher to come back and try again. We thought we'd give them another try, since it was a busy Friday and they just opened. Second time we went on Wednesday night. The restaurant was half empty, but we still waited an hour for our food! Do not go there if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Went here to have lunch. The service was great, food was great and atmosphere was amazing. Not sure about the negative reviews but it looks like things have changed and this franchise is performing much better. Id recommend anyone visit if you're out and about"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery tonight from here I have for years my brother friend was a cook there for the longest time so I know portion sizes I got the Bacon Penne pasta and my container wasn't even full it was half full and for $22.00 I personally think that's a rip off. My boyfriend was a cook for 6 years and even said it was fucking ridiculous.... I called to complain they are sending me \"credit\" that I probably won't even get. Will not be ordering from here or visiting the location anymore and will be telling my friends..."}
{"text":"Officially my favourite BP in the city.

This particular location is one of the bigger ones I've been too, and the service that I've received here is consistent.

I recently tried their perogie pizza (definitely not the healthiest option on their menu) and let me tell you, it is to die for! SOOO GOOD! I also thoroughly appreciate their nachos and their Thai bites.

BPs is always a standard favourite of mine but this particular location is where you're most likely to find me."}
{"text":"What the heck? No free parking? Called in and they said there was no complimentary parking at all for this location! 

Came here on a Friday night. It got kind of busy because there was a Leafs game going on. Go Leafs Go! They have two sides: the lounge/bar area and the dining area. 

My party ordered for starters: cactus cut fries, over-roasted wings, BP house salad and two beers. Beers came quickly as I was watching the game. It took over 20 minutes for these items to come together. When you are hungry, the wait can be agonizing! The cactus cut fries were warm and had a spicy kick to it when you finish one.The wings were just alright and the salad tasted just ok. For the main, we ate a medium deluxe pizza. I find that the pizzas are way overpriced. It was alright. 

Service was just alright. It took a while for our server to figure out if we can pay with a gift card and cash or not. There was quite the confusion there and it took a bit of time. 

Not the best place for food but its a good place to have a beer and watch any big sporting event if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Received cold food and rock hard bun on burger.  Waitress also had the worst BO!"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER! Waited 15 minutes before someone took a drink order. 10 before it arrived. 15 before bartender took food order. 

I love BP but this location is a TOTAL failure"}
{"text":"I love the wings from here ! I had to wait for a min but they were so good nd the fries where fresh how i like them , i will be going there again."}
{"text":"After a Raptors Game my date and I decided to head to Boston Pizza. We were craving the famous Perogie Pizza!! From the moment we walked in the experience was fantastic. We were warmly greeted at the host stand with a big welcome and smile. We got seated at a high top table beside the bar and didn't have to wait long on our server. We were attended to right away and our drinks came promptly. We ordered 3 dishes and all came out in a reasonable time considering we ordered a pizza. I would say maybe 15 min max. What I thought was an even nicer touch was that one of the managers Jen came over and made sure to check in on how our experience at the restaurant was so far and if we needed anything at the moment. I believe it is very important for guests to feel welcome because if the guest feels welcome and has a good experience they will always return. Jen took care of us with some of the best service I have experienced thus far at a restaurant. The atmosphere in the restaurant also apealed to us because we are sports fans and the whole restaurant is stacked with TV's that were playing all games on at the time. Another awesome touch was that behind the bar was a highlight TV which kept us in the know with the previous game results and current game results of the day. Overall I would 100% recommend this Boston Pizza location. The food was amazing and the menu has changed a bit since I had been there last ( for the better of course). Seems like they have added a lot more menu options to choose from, even on the healthier side. The service was fast, friendly and efficient. Definetly heading back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Came for their free small thin crust pizza creations, they were giving out 10000. So I guess the Bain consultant has the breakeven at 10000 quantity after considering average transactions for customers, hoping to gain and reach markets who normally didn't frequent BP. Won't be coming back however! 

BP is a staple here - UFC nights, beers, decent food. But never did I think the service would be so poor - like at a western resto you expect the service to be great! That's why you pay a 15% tip. But this places has slower/worse service than an Asian place...

1. Took 45 mins to get a salad
2. Salad came/ was the wrong salad but paid for it anyways. 
3. Asked for no olives because of allergies, managed to mess that up when I told them I wanted to go and they packed it up. 
4. Good guy still tipped them even though it was to go. 
5. Will never come back to this BP although their new pizza was good, so good job reinventing the new menu! 
6. Sucks how BP corporate spends 10000*$15=$150000 investment to rollout their new promotion, when everything gets ruined at retail level. Take a look into it."}
{"text":"4 waitress sitting in far booth. See me looking for a table. 

None bother to help. I walk almost into kitchen and out... Still ignore me.

Has happened several times in past year. I done with this place. 

Need professional manager."}
{"text":"Good service, the staff is friendly but on busy nights they may not notice that empty pint of beer or one of your friends haven't received their meal yet.

Atmosphere is loud and wild in a good way. Montreal Canadiens will always be on and is usually their best night in the bar. The dinning room is a little less rowdy for those family dinners.

Food is average, like most chain restaurants the menu is pretty basic but I still love the pizzas.

Everything is reasonably priced but they try to up-sell the alcohol. An appetizer, 2 mains and 2 pints can cost around 50$. But for sure will fill you up.

Also, it's conveniently located around a mall and hotel.

Good place to grab a quick bite and beer, the pastas are sweet and my favorites are the pizzas and if you don't mind the loudness and patriotic cheers for the Canadiens, this is a good place to eat"}
{"text":"Los chicken finger un poco salados pero la pizza   es una delicia  recomendaria este lugar"}
{"text":"Food Poisoning! And denying responsibility!

Beware of contaminated food if you decide to make the mistake of eating here, three adults and one infant got food poisoning eating here. Please beware of eating here and stay away as far as possible from this restaurant. 

I was here last week visiting my family, there was altogether 7 of us, and one of the things we ordered was the spaghetti with meatballs. We ordered that for my baby niece who is only one year old since thats the only thing that she could eat on the menu. Three adults and the baby tried it, all four of us got very sick. 

My baby niece had to spend the night in the hospital the following night and the rest of us had serious food poisoning symptoms. All of us had serious symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. My niece lost weight and got very sick. The poor baby couldn't even attend the day care and me and her dad couldn't go to work.  My brother in law came back from a doctor that confirmed he got food poisoning and now has to take medication for it. I am very certain that it was this restaurant who made us sick, cause I noticed I vomited pizza and spaghetti.

When we notified the restaurant manager of what happened a few days after this incident on the phone, that manager couldn't care less and denied all responsibility, before hanging up on us rudely.

Boston Pizza of Scarborough Town Center, you got three people sick and an infant hospitalized by sending out rotten food, shame on you! We are more than happy to provide evidence and proof to substantiate our claims from doctors and hospital visits. My family has been a loyal customer of this chain and a lot of people love your food. It is your responsibility to follow necessary food preparation procedures for the sake of your customers!"}
{"text":"Service is warm inviting atmosphere. Clean restaurant and yes it does get pricey. Pepsi is $3 and some cents. Pizzas are rich u think u need large but u probably don't. Cactus fries are a nice app. Didn't see the need for all the toppings and guacamole. Their wings are good. But all dipping sauces have the from the bottle flavor. Lovely ambience large windows and family feeling. Shout out to the fabulous service."}
{"text":"I found the service to be amazing with the waiter refilling my drink when ever it was empty, but I only finished my drink once. The food was to be expected for the price, but in the end it was still a good meal."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed eating here and the service has always been great. We go with our kids and are happy that the kids menu are reasonably priced and there is a kids corner where they have a chalkboard, ipad and little activity toys for them to play with. The food is good too, typical chain food restaurant but it's always nice to get that consistency. 

We have ordered the steak, sandwiches, burgers, nachos and appetizer plates and they're always delicious."}
{"text":"Great service, fast service, good food, food cooking was a bit bad, but overall ok. Have to improve, the temperature and cooking time. Server super good, maybe because resto was quiet, will have to retry when full"}
{"text":"Having been to Boston Pizza many times, since my little guy loves the kids meals, I can say I have never had a bad experience. Most times good or great.

I can honestly say that the food is consistently good and the service is as well. Especially when dining with kids. They are quiet quick and attentive.

This location was my first visit since I happen to be in the neighborhood. It is located right in the Dalhousie Station complex and had a steady flow of customers.

Drinks, food and dessert were at a nice pace. Prices are reasonable and quality  of food is always good/great. 

We had a lovely waitress and even went the extra mile when my little guy ordered \"worms and dirt\" for dessert, which is pudding with sour worms. A big hit with kids and kids at heart. She even brought him a small container of extra worms to enjoy."}
{"text":"In what world is it OK to make a salad with UNpitted olives?The only reason I gave it a two is because my coworker ordered a calzone that was very tasty. Otherwise, the choking / dental hazard  of salad that I ordered would have been given a one or a negative. Geez."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews for this place before deciding to come here for dinner. This location recently opened and the food here is awful! DO NOT GO HERE!

We ordered a nachos for our appetizer and pizza burger and the big dipper for our entrees.

The nachos were ok but they were stingy on the cheese. 

The beef patty for the pizza burger was still cold like it just came out of the fridge. They remade it and the patty was only warm. There was no steam coming from the burger. It's obvious that the beef patty was originally frozen.

The big dipper sandwich was missing the crispy onion straws and braised onions. The manager tried to explain to me that the braised onion is mainly in the dipping sauce but the menu clearly indicates that it should be in the sandwich and it also shows it in the picture! He was apologetic but he should have admitted to the error rather than make up an excuse that's not even valid!

They took both items off the bill but still made me pay for the nachos even though the entire experience was awful.

DO NOT GO HERE, IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY!"}
{"text":"I rushed here after work the other day to watch game 6 and made it to watch the sad ending to a great season. I picked BP not only because it was the closest but because they had Blue Jays plastered all over the place so I thought it would be a great place to watch the game. I was wrong, so wrong. 

I think this might have been the worst service I have ever gotten. We got seated and we didn't even get menus or even a glance from any waiter or waitress for 30 min! Honestly I was just happy to have somewhere to watch the game, but my friends were not happy at all. If you're labeled as a \" great place to watch the game\" you should have more people working on a game night. 

It's okay, there's always next season BP."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch and dinner. Everything we've tried there has met our expectations, if not exceeded. We've had their nachos, and several different types of pastas. They offer halal food, which is rare in the Durham area. 

Service is great, the waitresses are all friendly. They'll also remember you if you go in more than a couple times. Wait times for the food are about average as well.

The prices are okay - I think this is their major area of improvement if they want to remain competitive."}
{"text":"Been going here after work Friday nights with colleagues...noticing the service in the bar is very slow and drinks and food take a lot longer to get to you then they should...We def. won't be visiting anymore since we were served raw meat!! Thai chicken bites were gooey, pinkish raw ...so disgusting..the chicken was taken off my bill and I still paid for my drinks :/ used to love this location but the service just isn't the same anymore, clearly neither are the kitchen staff! Also just to note their Friday night fishbowls are t even full halfway anymore...meh!
Hoping I don't get sick!!"}

{"text":"I generally avoid all Western franchise restaurants like Boston Pizza, Kelsey's, Jack Astors, etc. because they're really expensive and the food is usually, most of the time, very bland. This particular Boston Pizza location was awful. The service was nice and attentive, but the food here...oh my gosh! Just super tasteless. I had shared some steak with a friend (I think it was well-done), and it was way too raw and flavourless. I also had their soup here, which came out luke-warm and I found it to be lacking flavour as well in saltiness. Would not recommend this Boston Pizza location to any of my friends..."}
{"text":"Four of us went to this BP's location. It was out first time in the restaurant side as we had an infant with us, but prior to today, we had always enjoyed good service in the lounge.  Today upon coming in, the young front desk girl looked at out baby carrier, looked at her coworker and rolled her eyes. Wow, thanks... 

Next after requesting a booth, we were brought to a table and half booth which would not fit the carrier. We politely asked to be moved to the other side which had space for all of us, to which the little girl sighed loud enough for us to hear her and say 'fine' overly sternly. I asked directly, if this is a problem, she looked at me and said \"we need to rotate where you people sit for our waitresses...  But I also HAVE to do what you want... So whatever, it's fine\".  What a terrible way to start our evening. Thanks kiddo, because or your snitty little attitude, we won't be spending our money in your after-school job again. 

Food was good. Our server 'Tori' was kind and courteous, but the front host kid needs training on how to be a hostess."}
{"text":"This pizza was dank as fuck. Went in earlier because it was close to our hotel anf I'm still thinking about it."}
{"text":"I tried to find a decent place in the area to have a lunch. It would be better if I went across the street to McDonalds.

At first I picked table by the window. I was alone on my business trip that day.  I am more outdoor person and I enjoy, if there is no patio open,  just to watch through the window. Too late I realize they stored garden chairs covered with a tarp right next to the window. I felt like sitting in a storage. Who ever place the chairs by the window should think twice where to store it next winter.

Waitress showed up with red nose and watery eyes. Having flu or allergy. Several times I'd tried to get her attention, after the lunch, to ask why Wi-Fi was not working. I finally gave up. Poor girl, she was probably upset about her physical condition.

I ordered pizza. It was average. Too expensive for the size. Pardon me, I come from the U.S. and may not be realistic what's expensive and what's not in Canada.

And what made me write all of this?

She brought me a cup of coffee. I would call it warm just because it wasn't quite cold."}
{"text":"TWO WORDS: Pirogi Pizza. 
Haha. Just kidding...sort of. I ordered this pizza by chance (serendipity?) the first time I came to this location and I've had to fight my brain really hard (often in vain) to try to order something else on return visits. It's a pizza layered with spicy potatoes (scalloped?) covered with cheese, bacon, and green onions and a bit of sour cream to cool the potatoes. It's surprisingly awesome.
All the other pizza is always pretty good here if not mind blowing. The house sauce in particular is pretty top notch. The other food is pretty good in a sort of Kelseys/Pickle Barrel/Jack Astor's average kind of way.
I've come here for lunch a few times from work and the lunch menu has a couple decent pastas and lunch sized pizzas on it. 
My issue here has been with service on multiple occasions. Once or twice I've had issue even getting someone at the front entrance to seat us. On one occasion at a work lunch my boss had to wander around the restaurant to find our waiter to pay after being left alone for 15 minutes. Boo. Was going to be a 4, until I remembered all the issues I've had getting service here in the past."}
{"text":"Love the gourmet pizza at Boston Pizza!! The Amigo, Spicy Perogy, Tuscan and I can go on and on. They are all so good.  What this Boston pizza made it stand out the most is the service I got.  The server I got was very attentive and came to check up if everything was okay many times.  Can't wait till the weather get warmer to take advantage of the outside patio!!  Pizza pricing is def more expensive than other pizza places but you have to pay for what you get!!

Average price of the pizza: 
Individual - $12 - 8\"
Small - $17 - 10\"
Med - $26 - 13\"
Large - $31 - 15\"

Depending on which flavor you select it could be + or - $2-3"}

{"text":"I was helping celebrate a girlfriend's birthday yesterday and she chose Boston Pizza in Crowfoot as her desired lunch locale. I hadn't been there forever and was looking forward to revisiting the joint.

We were one of four occupied tables in the restaurant and what a way to be patriotic: they had the Olympics airing on every television in the place. The service rocked my socks and they didn't raise a brow when I asked to customize my salad according to certain food restrictions.

My salad came and was perfect (you wouldn't believe how often places can mess up something as simple as a customized salad) and we didn't feel rushed to leave.

We enjoyed a leisurely lunch and a leisurely coffee and promised we'd be back again very soon.

Great job to the Crowfoot BP Crew!"}
{"text":"I would like to give them less than a star.  My wife and I went to this location for supper in 2012.  The girl who took our order brought wrong order twice before we received the food we actually ordered in her attempt after two hours.  We also went to BP at crowfoot location in Calgary after that and the quality of their food was pretty bad.  Since then we stopped going to BP."}
{"text":"This establishment has recently underwent a renovation. Although I did not see it prior to the renovation it looked nice. However, along with the renovation they should have undergone a server renovation. 

My husband and I arrived around 3pm for a late lunch. There was one server and we were his second table. We ordered the pizza roll appetizer, a small custom pizza, and a chicken pasta.

20 minutes later another table arrived,sat next to us in the adjoining booth and got their appetizer before we did. I was so furious that as he was talking their food order I blurted out that we still haven't received our appetizer. He barely acknowledged me with a sideways glance,and said he'd check.

I went outside to cool down. Was starving and couldn't believe we sat there for that long without the server at least giving us an explanation as to why we didn't receive our appetizer.

Sure enough when I returned inside, both our food and appetizer were on the table. The server explained to my husband while I was outside that the app had fell on the floor and the cook neglected to tell him.

Likely story. Even If true, why wasn't he on top of it wondering where our app when he was delivering the second tables app? Would have sent alarm bells off in my head! 

I've been a server for many years. What happened was he forgot to put our app in. This confirmation came when he only took off (aka didn't charge) my coke. 

If this was truly a cook mistake he would have went to management to remove the app or at least had management offer something for our inconvenience. 

I saw right through this servers shenanigans and it took everything in me not to go to management and complain. I'd rather leave this review so their business suffers. 

Food was good but I'll never return. Apparently it takes till you're in a coffin before food arrives at this location. No thanks. There isn't a server there worth staying to wait for this food"}
{"text":"This place and location is always busy! We went out for a family dinner,  child in tow!

We were seated promptly and our child was kept busy with the kids menu, Coloring pages and crayons :)

We had a fantastic server, Kimberly who was training another waitress so her hands were full and very busy. Kimberly was always checking in with us, took our order quick and always was so friendly and a real delight.

The service knocked our socks off! The Appies, dinner, drinks and dessert were all wonderful. No complaints at all about the food. Everything was delicious.

Kimberley was really wonderful and when paying, we told her so. She told us she loved her job and really appreciated the compliment.

Excellent service, food and great value for a family night out.

All in all everything was fabulous!!! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"If I was to imagine the worst service it would have been better than the service we received yet again here. Devon was our server and clearly had no desire to actually serve us. It took over 30 minutes to get a glass of water he missed for my sister even after being reminded. We saw our food sitting under the heat lamps after waiting over an hour and had to ask for it. When we did get the food our wings were wrong and when we asked he reported that we must have been mistaken. Always good to say it's the customers fault. He was extremely rude and in the end charged us full price for the wings even though it was wing night and was 50% off, sadly we noticed after we left.  For a party of 9 when you know it's going to be a large bill and you could get a good tip you would think you would at least be polite. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"$53 for three appetizers and a tiny gluten free pizza with pathetic amount of toppings, WOW! I paid an extra $5 for little shreds of onion and green pepper. When you are paying that much for extra toppings, one would expect more than that. Not here apparently. The quality and portions for the crazy high prices is disappointing to say the least. After this last experience, I will no longer be supporting them!"}
{"text":"Based on its name, Boston PIZZA should be shooting out some pretty epic pizzas! Unfortunately, this was ONE OF MY WORST DINING EXPERIENCES!! 

First of all, I ordered the Baja thin crust pizza. Upon its arrival, I noticed that all I could see on the pizza was corn throughout, two pieces of diced green pepper, and one piece of diced red pepper. I asked our waiter if this was really what the pizza was and he quickly responded yes. He thought again and looked at the menu and said oh, they forgot the cheese. Pretty big thing for the the kitchen to miss on a pizza, but if there was no cheese, then there was nowhere for the peppers and non-existent onions to hide!

When I asked to speak to the manager, our cocky waiter began to defend himself and repeatedly asked if I really wanted to still speak to the manager. The manager was a soft spoken nervous guy who couldn't give any explanation for anything, and kept defending the restaurant. I just sat there watching my 3 friends eat their meal - I wasn't going to spend any money there and wait for another comical meal with that level of service. 

The manager eventually came back and told us that the two pops that someone ordered were on the house and that we got 20% off our bill. At least there was that, and at least the manager apologized. 

Safe to say I'm never going back."}

Overall 4 by 5

My wife and I enjoyed our pizza at the Dalhousie location and have no serious complaints.   

I know, right?  Revealing commentary.    :)

I ordered a large Perogi Pizzazz pizza (that's right, I have my standby pizza and even though they changed the name., I am the customer and I am right and I call it by its old name) and my wife a small Boston Royale.   It would stand to reason that a large would take more time to cook and therefore don't start them both in tge oven at the same time.  We had to send her cold pizza back for a reheat.    But our waitress handled it like a pro.

Other than an empty glass for longer than I would have liked, service was actually pretty good tonight.  Wasn't perfect but I did overtip because she was just a going and handled our experience wonderfully.  Teagan was her name I believe."}
{"text":"We got Ravioli and Jambalaya pastas with Caesar salad. I've been here about 3 times so far since the first visit was amazing.. but the taste of food is actually going down every time I visit again. Their caesar salad is great tho!"}
{"text":"Our server Selene (?) was great, but be prepared for a big wait if you're coming in to watch a big game. Food was decent. I liked my Perogy Pizza a lot. Its definitely a great spot to catch a Leafs game if you can get in in time!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while visiting Toronto. My wife and I grabbed the Double Bacon Burger and it was everything you want in a good burger. Their kids menu has a good assortment and healthy options for those that don't want their kids eating fries. Dessert was included with it too! Overall, a great experience considering we were a party of 6; 4 adults and two kids who ordered appetizers before hand. Would definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Love it here ... Awesome service great food!!! I keep coming back and I'm never disappointed... Boston pizza has the best staff ever!!!"}
{"text":"i was sooo offended. as the manager of a bar, i understand some things take time, but being rudely greeted by the bar staff and ignored for  10 minutes while they do nothing is pretty bad to begin. having the barstaff  whispering to each other while blatantly pointing at my friend is obscene. we asked to move to a table. they said fine, no one brought us menus or asked us if we wanted drinks. the bitchy blond bartender walked right by the table 4 times, making a point of not looking at us and cleaning tables right next to ours, yet still ignoring us. then she walked to the edge of the bar and twirled her hair for a bit, all the while making sure not to make eye contact with us. we finally went over to the bar and asked the guy if we could get menus or drinks or service, explaining to him that we have been waiting for ten minutes, when he rudely informed me that i had only been waiting 20 seconds. so i asked for the bill from our drink at the bar, had my tip rudely returned to me, amid more whispering and pointing at us. im disgusted and quite upset about being treated like that, especially because i used to be quite a regular there, and im a big tipper and very polite(dont forget i manage a bar, and it should be all about customer service). i wouldnt recomend this place to anybody for any reason. maybe a different location, not this one."}
{"text":"I was at this Boston Pizza to watch the leafs game with friends. I have to say that the manager at this restaurant was terrible. The other girl behind the bar was working so hard, very friendly and seemed very customer oriented. The manager, stood with a group of guys at a table watching the game, and kissing one of them through out while the other girl worked very hard. It was quite busy for the game, and very sad to see that only one waitress took her job seriously and put all customers first."}
{"text":"I ordered a sub with out tomato and mayo. It was delivered to me with tomato and American cheese. the menu says subs come with provolone. so I called and they sent another sub to me this one again had tomato on it. I called the manager she apologized and said my next order will be discounted. the sub was very good price was right delivery was fast"}
{"text":"Pros: Free Parking

Cons: Pretty much everything. I get that it's a chain, and you go in expecting food from a chain, but wow. Not worth it for the price. No garnishes on anything, we've been in this location several times, because it's right off the highway on the way home and literally every time my server has been new to the restaurant. Managers are unwilling to do anything to help and you have to argue to get booths because hostesses are not allowed to \"double seat\" servers. Definitely will not be back at this point."}
{"text":"What an awful experience.  I'm giving it 2 stars because the food was fine.  

After a very long day setting up a wedding outside of Airdrie on August 1st, we stopped in for a fishbowl and some pasta.  It took a little longer for us to be greeted in the bar than expected, but the server was very friendly.  When she brought us our drinks, she let us know that she was off shift and somebody else would be taking over our table.  Sounds good.  

Except.... we didn't get to meet her.  My seat was facing the bar.. and after about 15 minutes, I saw who I assumed was our new waitress, point at our table and with a very dirty look on her face, told the other waitress (the one who was off shift and was gathering up her things) to take our order.  The first girl was visibly frustrated at that, but had a smile on her face when she came to our table.  We gave her our order, as well as a $5 bill to make sure that she got the tip she deserved.

Our new waitress brought our food out.  Didn't introduce herself, didn't ask if we needed anything else.  My friend had to stop her as she was walking away and ask for another beer.

She didn't come back to our table.  She was too busy dealing with the table next to us, who she had apparently tried to seriously overcharge, to the point that the manager finally had to come out and fix it.  When she finally came to our table to box up our leftovers, we asked for the bill.  another 10-15 minutes went by.  She was in the bar the entire time.  Didn't appear busy, but did not print our bill or bring it to us.  The other tables in the bar were obviously receiving the same level of service we were and were visibly upset.

I'd had enough.  When she finally glanced in our direction, I said very loudly across the bar \"Can we pay now?\" she laughed and printed our bill.  We paid the bill and left... feeling very confused about what we had just experienced."}
{"text":"This review is based on the experience one has having beers and pizza prior to a Jays game when the restaurant is quite busy.

I don't review a lot of chains, but this Boston Pizza is quite different from its suburban counterparts. It's a large space that feels much more polished and provides great street views.

In terms of the food, the pizza is decent (the Spicy Perogy pizza is different), as you would expect, but very overpriced for what you get. In terms of beer selection, it's decent but unspectacular.

The seating is pretty cramped in the bar area and the service is quite slow. There's really nothing to recommend here."}
{"text":"Meh. The food is just ok. The service was great. We both ordered pasta dishes and there was nothing special about them.

The Bacon Wrapped Steak Skewers appetizer was the best thing I've ever had at Boston Pizza. It was refreshing to get something that stood out. 

Hoping they come out with a new menu to revive the pasta. I usually order a pizza or a sandwich, so it looks like it's back to that for my next visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We got seated and our waitress came to get our drink orders and we had to repeat twice because she couldn't remember. She then came back for our orders and we had to repeat again because she couldn't remember. Left us sitting around with no drinks for half an hour, served my brother in law a steak dish with no steak knife, our appetizers had come out after we finished our main course, we asked for the kids food to come out first and it ended up coming out all at once. To think we were gonna order more food from them but with the terrible service we just decided to leave as fast as we can. Not to mention they didn't come and ask for our bill, I had to get up from my seat and asked for a bill myself or we could've been sitting there for hours."}
{"text":"Sooo good stop by obsessed with the mushroom pie! Hidden gem for brownies too lol. If your trying do something simple stop here. Nothing fancy just good food."}
{"text":"Love this place have been coming here for 5 years already and will always be coming back. Great portions and great food. Always wonderful cuatomer service"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this Boston Pizza location yesterday and needless to say, it was terrible. We got seated at about 9:30, we placed our drink order and we both ordered a starter (a salad and a wrap), we didn't get our starter until 10:30, on top of that, my salad was disgusting and soggy. Our drinks were so flat that when our \"waitress\", if you could even call her that, came back around, she thought it was water. The manager finally came out and said our meals got \"lost and we don't know what happened\" (everyone around us were eating) and she'll reduce our bill for us, we finally get our food and it was trash...this place is really hit or miss, the first time we went we got an amazing waiter. This girl came an hour after she first dropped off our drinks for us to finally check on us asking if we wanted a refill, it was terrible."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but seems to be going down hill fast. The service was slow and the food was brought out cold. the pizza had very little sauce and cheese. Staff did not seem to care and we had to ask for drink refills...was not offered. I would not recommend this boston pizza."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't review that any lower than that if I could I definitely would. Worst service ever and not from any server but the Manager. She took our order very rudely and then serve us wrong and when we told her this is not what we order rather than being apologytic she started accusing us and kept insisted we ordered this. Kindly save yourself sometime of not going to this place and get treated like shit. WORSE BOSTON PIZZA LOCATION With Worst Manager ever"}
{"text":"Was here for a business meeting. Drinks arrived quickly, but refills did not. The servers seemed really unorganized; they didn't seem to know their section. We had a different person almost every time someone came to the table. They forgot about us and we hadn't ordered our meals yet. 

I wouldn't go here for lunch if you're on a time constraint."}
{"text":"It's just ok and it's alway been just ok. There's nothing on the menu that really stands out. The service is good and venue itself always very clean, but meh. It's just not special. I have nothing against this place, but I'll never say, 'I could really go for Boston Pizza.' It's a good, neutral place for picky eaters, kids and various food tastes, because they try to have something for everyone. Everything is pretty reasonably priced. Meh."}
{"text":"Bad service. Bad food. Do not book a party here. If another party is booked and out numbers you, you will not receive service. At least the waitress did say \"sorry I can't help you. You guys are a party of 25, and my party of 45 are getting here.\" Our party had been there for  30 mins. I do not blame the service staff at all, I have been a server for 7 years and when management doesn't schedule properly it's not their fault. Due to the low prices I did not expect great food, but a place named Boston Pizza should at the very minimum not serve tasteless cardboard pizza. We ordered shrimp tacos which were inedible. Did not send back as the poor server was swamped. I would highly recommend Not going here. I believe there's a Dairy Queen close by."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty wings. If you have a rental and have some time get an order for your hotel room and munch on them when you get home from the club or casino. They also have a tasty philly and yes..it does come with chesse whiz.

Can't speak for the pizza but I'll have to give it a try when I go back.

BTW..you can eat in too but the AC is pretty weak and it gets stuffy in here but they do have beer!"}
{"text":"Stopped here just for a quick beer and nachos after the movies. It's like any other Boston Pizza. Look out for the ladies bathroom though it was horrible, I swear no one cleans it."}
{"text":"Great place to be if you wanna catch a sports game and knock back a couple of beers (of which there are some amazing deals each day of the week). The Nachos are awesome fully loaded & the Bbq Chicken pizza rocked."}
{"text":"SUCKS!!!!!!! Pizza was absolutely disgusting!!!!! My drink was nasty I wouldn't be surprised if I get sick from this crap. Don't come here"}
{"text":"Service is awful. Wait staff are not attentive nor friendly. You'd be lucky if you get served within 15 minutes after seated. No wonder why this place is often not busy. 

Food is ok, nothing special. I would spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awful. Everytime we go there's always a problem. My family will not go back. I ordered the double back chicken wings. They come to the table the server announces FRIED WINGS. I promptly said i ordered baked. He stared at me and said he said baked salt and pepper... my husband agreed he did not. The wings were so oily i asked him how is it possible that these are baked. He assured me they were. When he came back I showed him the oil on my plate... he says I saw them take it out if the oven.... they're baked. I ask to speak to someone as these were not baked. He offered to give me something else but i had a time restraint, I needed to eat. He didn't come back to our table other then cleaning dishes. Charged us full charge even though my meal was awful. Don't waste your time eating here."}
{"text":"Ok, so there's a LOT of good pizza in this town, so the bar is pretty high. But if your looking for basic, pizzeria style \"Medium-dish\" pizza, this is the spot. 

The cheese they use is pretty good, and is piled high and roasted to perfection, and the sauce is just your basic tomato sauce, but I do have to note that it doesn't have that acrid \"I just came out of a can and am gonna give you Alzheimer's\" aftertaste. The crust takes the show though. I think they're using a combination of baking soda and yeast, so it still has the complexity in flavor that the yeast will give, and the baking soda gives it that thin crusty outer layer, perfect for reheating in a toaster oven the next day. 

They deliver pretty much anywhere in the Downtown area, and they are super fast. (Last time I ordered, they had my pizza here in less than 15 minutes) 

Oh, and if your gonna try them out, order a pickup on Tuesdays, they have the 2 for 1 special which ain't bad for two medium pizzas at 11.99 a piece ;-) 

And if your looking for parking, I usually just park next door at OG's, I don't think the bouncers there really care ;-)"}
{"text":"Positive: server was quick and nice. 

Negative: everything else 

Apps platter was oily and salty. My entree: chocked jambalaya pasta disgusting !!! Eeww. Desert was pathetic. Senseless tasteless food. The place was nearly empty for a Friday night. Even my coke was tasteless and flat. There is no quality on the food. I normally would never go to
Boston pizza but I'm forced  to go when someone is having a gathering or something. 

Also the manager came
Out to check
On his guests. This is always a good technique and shows excellent customer care. Once again service was great but they need to change up recipes for a more yummy experience. 

They also gave my nephew crayons, another satisfying experience by the staff!!   Boston pizza is only good for group events wanting to watch a sports game
On their large screens. 

Bp, please reinvent your menu"}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for a pizza, when we asked if there was a problem they said the kitchen had made a mistake and that the food would be right out. Ten minutes later it arrived, missing an ingredient. I pointed this out to the server and she looked equally frustrated, but that wasn't much comfort.

The Popeye pizza was supposed to have spinach and roasted garlic...somehow they managed to make it completely flavourless. 

My companion ordered a burger and said it tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp while they remade the pizza.

I would have given the food and the server 2 stars, but screwing up the order twice and waiting 50 minutes for something wrong earns a 1 star. Barely."}
{"text":"If you're coming with a group to sit at a patio...this would be a great place but food isn't the greatest!

My girlfriend and I had a day off Monday and wanted to enjoy a nice lunch outdoors.  There's a great patio as mentioned but I wasn't impress with the food.  We ordered Greek salad, pizza, and a pitcher of MDG Millers.  Was expensive compared to most pizza places and nothing really \"WOW\" me.  Salad was great but how can you mess that up.  The pitcher of MDG was a bit overwhelming as it smelled like bleach.  At least we knew it was clean but every gulp tasted disgusting but we finished it since we've never wasted beer.  It all came to about $31 with tip.  I would've done much better at Pizza Hut.

Service was okay but nothing special."}
{"text":"Sometimes, it's just better to stay in. We usually trust the quality and service at BP's, but this location was a disappointment. The space was dirty and the food poorly cooked to the point of being inedible. The staff here were clearly not fond of their job. This location is in serious need of an overhaul."}
{"text":"The renovations they've done here are great but honestly they need to add some flavor to their food. I just don't have anything positive to say about it. It's a good spot to come for a drink though and watch the game. They've also got a patio as well but not much of a view."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times I think Jim needs to attend his restaurants for quality control because it is not there.  Here is your test .. go tonight order something ... go in two days order the same thing... go two days from then order the same thing again. At no time will you believe you are ordering the same thing.  Very disappointing...Jim come visit your stores are lacking! I wont even watch dragons den any more because of the lack of quality at your restaurants but yet the price keeps hiking up!"}
{"text":"Our group stood at the entrance waiting to be greeted/seated.  No one.  Sure, the Raptors were playing and only ten minutes left on the clock, but there should always be someone at the front.  

Eventually someone came and set us up in a booth.  We weren't there for food (I hate the pizza here) but for birthday drinks (it was the middle of the day)---no judgment please.  :)

The group ordered a pitcher of beer and a few rounds of shots.  What?  No grenades?  Ok, we will make our own.  

The service was passable.  She seemed overwhelmed even though it wasn't a full, full house.  Maybe they were just understaffed because the greeter was cleaning up tables and actually looked like the manager (based on what she was wearing).

We were checked on only once after all the drinks were served.  No biggie.  We are low maintenance people.  

Our mission was accomplished: birthday drinks and our friend didn't have to travel too far from home."}
{"text":"Well took a chance after reading the reviews , service was good, food was quick , tasty and hot and it was busy lunch time.
Portions were large, ingredients were fresh.

I would return."}
{"text":"Im not usually a big fan of chains but this Boston Pizza is definetly decent. The food is pretty good quality and service is fairly speedy. I had the Bacon Penne Pasta and it was about a 6.5/10. My girlfriend had the wings and she said they were very good as well. Two days ago, we went with my girlfriend and her mother and we split the Boston special pizza, it was also fairly good. Only caution about this resteraunt is that the music is super loud and usually awful electronica garbage."}
{"text":"In terms of chains, I'm a pretty big fan of Boston Pizza, and I do believe this this location is my favourite.

To get the negative out of the way, it can get pretty noisy in there, and that's really all I can say.

The prices are decent for what you get. I don't really love their pizza all that much, but everything else on the menu is solid, in my opinion. I'm especially fond of their fettucinne alfredo. 

The service is also great. I hate to sound like a pig, but it should also be noted: I don't think I've ever seen such a level of consistent hotness as I've seen in the waitresses at this BP. it holds no bearing on my review of the place, but it's something. Ahem, anyway.

I don't think I've ever had a sub-par experience at that place, and it's a reliable option if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"I've seen this Boston Pizza hiding back behind the Canadian Tire at Lakeshore and Leslie for a while now. I kept thinking 'poor little Boston Pizza. I bet no one even knows you are back there in the shadows'. 
So last week I went to this Boston Pizza for dinner. To my delight and surprise, there was alot of customers. It probably helped that they have a bar section with a bunch of huge screen TV's showing the hockey playoff's. There was also some TV's showing golf, baseball or whatever else else is on at the time. The REAALLY big TV's had on the playoff's. Some guys sitting at the bar with a beer, watching the game. Some couples sitting in booths enjoying some pizza. 
The waitress was really friendly, service was quick. The food was good. And the prices were ok. I'd come back to this Boston Pizza again."}
{"text":"Cool place to catch a sporting event on tv but that's just about it.  Bartenders are rude and need to learn their manners. A simple smile can go a long way in the service industry. Food is your typical bar food."}
{"text":"While walking around the city recently after a movie, my girl and I thought we'd go with a safe bet: Boston Pizza. I've been to BP many times in the past, and have no gripes with their food. I had never been to this location though.

I have to say, the setup in this one is definitely classier than the ones I've been to in the past, and is very nice. Anyway, we took a seat upstairs, with a glorious view of uh...road construction?

Our waitress was definitely a nice girl, but she really gave off an overwhelmed vibe, which was funny, because it really didn't seem that busy at all. Anyway, we ordered drinks, and she was pretty prompt with bringing them to us. For food, my girl ordered a DELICIOUS chicken sandwich with honey mustard, and I (in a completely unexpected turn of events) ordered a prime rib burger. The food arrived in a timely fashion, and while my burger was fairly average, everything was still decent.

So where does the 2-star rating fit in? Well, we witnessed one thing that kind of bugged me. While in conversation, we both jumped about 3 feet in the air, when we heard a loud bang next to us. We quickly learn it was due to a waiter throwing a bunch of hard-cover menus down on the table next to us while seating some customers who just arrived. The reason for his sudden menu-drop? It seemed that he was seating the new arrivals at a table that had not yet been cleaned, and he stormed off to get the spray stuff and whatnot. Whether or not it was a tantrum-esque menu toss, or if it was accidental, I'm not sure. It certainly appeared to be deliberate, as he looked pissed off, and I think that's pretty unprofessional. I wonder how the new arrivals felt about that.

Not too long after that, we ordered another round of drinks, and our waitress vanishes. A long time goes by, and she comes by asking if we need anything. We ask about the drinks, and she confesses that she forgot all about our drink order. Okee dokee. She vanishes yet again, and we're at a point where we don't even really want the drinks anymore, until finally she brings them by. Waiting for the bill was another fun time. To be fair, she did apologize at the end for being scatter-brained that night, which we appreciated, but we've both experienced so much better from BP in the past. I'd return, but I'd be pretty hesitant."}
{"text":"First time for me at this new location. I got there early to meet up with friends and had a beer at the bar. The service was quick, beer cold and not too expensive. I ordered a personal pepperoni pizza which came promptly, hot. It was too big for me to finish. It was not the best nor the worst pizza I've had , just ok. The menu has changed considerably since I was there last and I have to say what was on there was a bit to pricey for me."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this location. 

I have never really been too fond of Boston Pizza, but I do eat there on occasion. This time however, was a terrible mistake. I ordered a sandwich with a ceasar salad. First of all, the waitress took forever to come to our table to take the order. After that, we had to wait quite a while to get our food. At this point, we were hungry so we dug right in... YUCK! The salad was soggy and tasted old, the sandwich was dry, and overall it was an absolutely terrible meal. I could not finish even half of it because of how bad it tasted. It is worth noting that I was here around 9PM, and it was not busy at all in the restaurant, so I am not sure why the service was so terrible.

Overall, I absolutely do not recommend this location to a friend and will never be going back here for a meal."}
{"text":"Last night I stopped by this location to pick up a takeout order I placed over the phone.  As soon as i entered the restaurant, the host greeted me. I told him I was there to pick up my order and he asked if I was \"Cher\"?  I told him yes and he took my payment and went to check on my order. A man walked in behind me and another server immediately asked him if he would like to dine at the bar or in the restaurant section of the restaurant. Before the host had time to return, three other employees asked me if I was had been helped. I told them, \"yes\" and before I knew it the young man was back with my order.

I checked my order to ensure the lettuce was crisp and it did not contain any cheese. The last few times my family picked up salads for me, they contained wilted lettuce and tons of cheese even though we requested that they be dairy free. 

This time Boston Pizza filled my order perfectly! However, I did specify that the lettuce must be crisp and there must not be any cheese on my order since they got it wrong the last few times. 

Allover, I was really happy with this takeout experience. The pickup process was a breeze and the employees were really great. 

I'm giving this location three stars as an average rating of my last few experiences. 

Every time I have dined in at the restaurant, there have been no quality issues with my food. I think it happens more often with take-out since you won't notice it until you get home.  Hopefully this is the beginning of improvements at Boston Pizza. 

My favourite gluten and dairy free dishes that can be tweaked to adjusted my dietary restrictions are the steak, salmon and beet salad. I highly recommend any of them if you visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't actually review this place since we never received service. We waited 10 minutes for a table on the patio after leaving out names with two bratty hosts standing behind a corporate podium. Once we were seated by the host we waited for 15 minutes and no server appeared. When she finally did walk past our table she completely ignored us.

Come On! I get that it's one of the first patio days of the season, and it's probably really busy, but at least stop by and tell us you'll be right with us or something. Finally, it seemed that the host was pointing us out to her-- letting her know that he had sat us (10 minutes ago) and she walked the other way, back into the restaurant.

I don't expect much of a chain restaurant on the food-front as it all comes in pre-prepared on trucks, but I expect them to have a decent training program and staff who know what's up. This was further proven to be false when I approached the hostess on our way out. I let her know that we waited for 15 minutes on the patio and no one visited our table. So we were leaving. She just shrugged and said \"I'm really sorry\", as though she couldn't care less. 

I'm pretty sure there was no manager on duty as this place was very badly staffed and poorly run-- especially for a franchise.

I won't be returning to any Boston Pizza any time soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for dinner with our baby daughter last weekend. Our server ended up being a friend of ours. The shrimp tacos were great!! I highly recommend it. Wasn't a big fan of their quesadilla though. But overall it was a satisfying meal. Family friendly restaurant. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Went here with family and friends of all age groups and had a great time. This is your typical pizza joint but pricier. We had a friendly and great looking waitress and she took care of everything without any problems through out our dining experience. We ordered our drinks and to start we got Pizza spring rolls, Cactus cut potatoes, Bacon wrapped steak skewers and Thai chicken bites. The food came out within 15 minutes and everything tasted great! Our server came back to ask for our mains, so we ordered The Meateor, Pulled Pork & The Rustic Italian pizzas.  As soon we finished our starters, the kind waitress was considerate to give us time in between to digest our food and got us some beverage refills. When we got our pizzas, the toppings were stacked with meat, veggies, and cheesy goodness, it was delicious!  I had about 5 slices, I didn't think I had room for dessert but the little kids ended up grabbing The Panookie and Chocolate Explosion. I just took a small bite and before you know it, I almost ended up finishing... both. We ended up ordering another round of dessert, yea.. it was ridiculous. Overall its your typical restaurant chain, the food is what you expect it to be but, more or less, I think you pay for the dining experience :)"}
{"text":"Tuesdays is the busiest and best day to order pizza.
Buy one get one free.
Shorter wait times they say.
Pizza is so cheesy"}
{"text":"Got over charged on fishbowl drinks because I ordered a 'slush' version. Doesn't say add $2 for slush on the special page (Friday 10.25). 

Mentioned it to my server, she blew it off. She never mentioned it when I ordered it (she even suggested the drink). 

Food was good. Server was absent quite a bit. We did have to keep asking for water repeatedly. 

We would return, but won't be ordering drinks again."}
{"text":"Ok thanks I tried that website ad you suggested to leave some info but it came Not Found ????
So I got an email from BP they sent me a coupon for an appetizer...Lol"}
{"text":"Crappy food and even crappier attitudes towards their customers. 

The guy who takes orders on the phone should definitely not be dealing with people we have found. 1st time we brushed it off but when it happened again we brushed them off and wont be back."}
{"text":"Tasteless. Looks nice cause I know how to take a picture. LOL. Needs a facelift. Food was average. Food is very INCONSISTENT AT this location.  Totally hit or miss. Drive 7 min to another location. Food was cold. Service not good."}
{"text":"Best place for a cold beer. Nice and relaxed at this location.  Service is always quick."}
{"text":"Food is sub par not worth the cost for what you get. I had the same rib and fries meal at Swiss Chalet at the same price and SC was ten times better quality....but at least they replaced the worn out booth seats, stick to apitizers and beer."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner on May 12, 2018. We had a fairly large group of 20+ people. We were seated in a section that had another large group of 20+ people, yet we had one server. You know what this means. 15 minutes for the lone server to take a drink order. 15 minutes for the drink to arrive. another 30 minutes to order food. another hour before the food arrives. And when we ask for the bill, another 20 minutes for that to arrive. The poor server, whose fault this is not, was running around like crazy. Management needs to get their act together. While I realize this was a large group, there was at least one other server that had much less to do in another section. Food wasn't bad, but the level of service was abysmal. 3 hours to have a drink and a burger seems unreasonable."}
{"text":"Came up to visit some friends in Canada and this was my first stop literally 30 mins after I landed. The food was good, the server was awesome, and the drinks were pretty good. You have to try the blue shots (I forgot what they're called. Rockstar? superstar? pornstar? something star.) they were so delicious!"}
{"text":"When my buddy suggested that we go to Boston Pizza to watch the UFC fight tonight I wasn't really that pumped. I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants. He told me that they have a lot of TV's, and no cover for UFC. They have two TVs in every booth. Every wall is covered in TVs. At one point, they showed a shot of Cung Le's busted nose... it was disgusting, I wanted to look away, but everywhere I looked there was a TV. I guess what I'm trying say is, they've got a lot of TV's. As for the atmosphere, it was below average for a UFC fight. They weren't even able to fill every seat. The wine selection was limited, but well chosen. I enjoyed a nice Cab Sauv by Mondavi. I didn't eat, but in general Boston Pizza has decent food. I'd give them five TV's out of five, but the service was brutally slow, so I've got to subtract one TV for that."}
{"text":"Went to this specific Boston restaurant for dinner after watching a movie. This restaurant doesn't seem to have many customers since it was still quite empty despite it was a Sunday night. The only few customers here were watching the NBA finals.

We ordered kale caesar salad, BBQ chicken pizza and chicken penne pasta. The kale caesar salad has good amount quinoa. We ordered a large size chicken pizza and the pizza, in my opinion, has too much cheese. The portion is more than good enough for 4 people. The chicken penne also has too much cheese.

The overall experience in this restaurant is just average."}
{"text":"\"With a group this large, someone is bound to get forgotten and left out. Bet you anything that person is going to be me.\"

Yeah. I know not to expect much from Boston Pizza. It's one of those \"we like to cover our bland food with cheese, fat and garlic\" places that I tend to avoid, because usually the only lactose-free dish I can get here is a big pile of lettuce-y yuck. But I came here, because I was invited to a Ladies Brunch with some very nice ladies. Fourteen, to be exact (and two little girls). 

When we sat down, I ordered a V8, because I'm savvy enough to realize that I was probably going to get my food last and would need something to tide me over. Something about ordering food with things left out; tends to gets bored kitchen staff that is used to mechanically plopping ingredients on a plate all nonplussed. What do you mean you don't want cheese on your pizza? Crazy pills. You are on them. The V8 arrived insipidly warm, despite the ice that was thrown in the glass.

But, a cheeseless individual pizza and yam fries is what I ordered. The waitress told me that there was no lunch deal on Sundays for sides, but I asked if I could get fries anyway and just pay the extra $$$; she said, \"sure, no problem.\" 

Twenty minutes later, orders slowly started to come out, and when I looked up expectantly, the waitress apologized and told me that they had accidentally put cheese on my pizza and they were making me a new one. She said that it would be discounted on my bill, and in the meantime, I could \"snack on the cheese.\" Er... pass. I told her that I was lactose intolerant (which, after years of being vegan, is true. My body no longer produces the enzymes necessary to break down dairy products), and she nodded and disappeared. 

Meanwhile, my drink glass was empty and she never bothered to offer a refill (which I would have been fully aware was not free, but I think I should've been offered one anyway), or a glass of water. Five minutes later, she came back, and told me the pizza would be a few more minutes. Ten minutes later, a flavorless heap on dough arrived. A few minutes later, when the waitress came back with the water glass I had to ask for, I asked when my fries were coming out.

\"You don't get fries. Remember? There's no deal today.\"

\"I'm aware, but I asked if you could just add it on anyway, and that I would pay for it; you said that was fine.\"

*Insert frozen, awkward smile here*

A different waitress brought the fries fifteen minutes later; long after the sad pizza was now sitting uncomfortably in my belly, because I was taught that wasting food, even bad food, is a sin. I asked for hot sauce that never arrived. 

If I hadn't been with company, I probably would've left after it was suggested that I \"snack on the cheese.\""}
{"text":"Been eating here since 2002, and the food still tastes the same. I've had better frozen pizza than the \"pizza\" they serve here. It's flavorless and the cheese they use is not good. It is very cheaply made. I ordered a medium pepperoni for my boyfriend, who likes EVERYTHING, and he ended up throwing most of it away. What a waste of $12.

I knew better, and ordered the wings. I've always liked the wings here. They use Frank's hot sauce which is the bestttt sauce for wings. It's spicy, vinegary, and delicious. They also have other flavors, like bbq and teriyaki, but I always get mild or hot depending on my mood. Get yourself an extra cup of their housemade ranch, it's bomb. These guys are open late, until 4am, next to OG."}
{"text":"** Boston Pizza has TSN2! **
Now, I don't know if you care or if this means anything to you, but for those of you who are Raptors fans such as myself, this means you can watch the Raptors (get brutally destroyed) on the nonexistent Rogers Cable channel as well!  

TSN2 is exclusive to Bell Sympatico (majority of consumers and businesses are Rogers) and yesserie, Boston Pizza is one of the few with TSN2!

With this revelation, normally my star rating would have increased or at least remained the same...
But I rage with annoyance when a waitress screws up my order and I'm forced to watch my friends enjoy their meals.  And by the time my meal arrives, I'm left eating by my lonesome. 

Boston Pizza, I was going to re-rate you a 2, but TSN2 saved your behind! Now don't f@ck up again or I'll be forced to only order drinks and not spend as much dough in your facility."}
{"text":"Good food, great attentive service and a nice enjoyable patio in the center of it all :)"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Terrible service. Hair on plates. (Picture below)  TWO OUT OF 8 sent dishes back. Including mine. A $17 Salad that took 45 minutes and was soggy and was topped with barely warm, hard over cooked chicken.

An appetizer (pita dip) came out within 5 minutes!! But was burnt tasting. Then the pita refill order came out 1hr and 5mim later - just 2 minutes before the bill. 

A \"quick lunch\" at a table for 6 took exactly 50 minutes to bring 5 dishes. The salad took an extra 5 min. And was so cold and soggy when it came. 

Pick ANY OTHER RESTO along front if you're in town for a Jays game or whatever. Or even another Boston pizza location. This one was terrible."}
{"text":"I came to Boston Pizza with my cousins to watch the game. We had a voucher for free pizza and we ordered a few beers and other appetizers. The service sucked, there were only two or three waiters for the entire bar section which slowed service down. We ordered pizza with half pepperoni and pineapple, the pizza came out without the pineapples which was disappointing. Other than that the food was decent, it seems like a typical chain restaurant. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Food was great, we sat outside and enjoyed the planes flying by every 2 minutes Waitress was super helpful and fast at getting our order and food taken care of.. Food was hot and fresh"}
{"text":"Are they rushed?  Everything we got was undercooked.  Pizza, cactus cuts, French fries!

Dough on the pizza was thick as all hell, and the sauce looks like it was flung at the pizza from across the room.

Pretty terrible guys.  I know it's a common chain, but this can't be the definition of consistency, far from it.

Brutal.  Won't be coming back.

Ps - I was a BP restaurant manager for 2 years when I was 20.  Quality control would be outraged."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas back in February and this pizzeria was close to my hotel. The pizza was fresh and tasted very good. I will definitely return for more on our next visit."}
{"text":"This place says it's Boston pizza but it's NOT the worst pizza ever had oily soggy and has no taste at all would NOT recommend this place to anyone at all find somewhere else to spend your money on"}
{"text":"We went for work, and it was really just ok.

Their $10 lunch selection is limited to half portions, the menu description does not match what we got.

I got the chipotle chicken flatbread, and it was just ok.
I had a stomach thing going for the next few hours unfortunately, so that takes away a star.

The service and decor is very good though, but one could do so much better than this chain in Montreal"}
{"text":"I just wish our BP was more like others I have visited.  Have been here in the past when they offered free kids meals for a promotion.  They were caught off guard and the place was packed and horrible service.  I don't think we ended up using those free meals, just to much hassle.  

I had the rack of ribs tonight, my rib scale goes like this...  Smokin Bones, Marky's, AAA, Ruth Chris,  Baton Rouge, Montanas, Swiss Chalet, Boston Pizza.  Kids meal was out of ice cream so had a revolt on my hands...  82$ for a family of 4."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this Boston Pizza last night and the service was friendly and competent. The place was not busy and we ended up there because the restaurant next door that we had intended on eating at was full and there was a wait. We wanted to see a movie so chose to go elsewhere.

The food was abysmal, we had the perogies and the steak with mashed potatoes. The steak was very thin and grisly. I ordered my steak med rare and because it was so thin the fat was uncooked but it was med rare and chewy. The potatoes were cold and the veg consisted of three carrot slices and raw onion. I had asked for mushrooms with my steak and it was brought with un cooked slices of mushrooms on top of the steak. 

The perogies were hot and bland and left my dinner partner with an upset stomach. We ordered boston cream pie and apple crumble for dessert and both were inedible. The boston cream pie was huge and simply awful. The crumble was so sweet as to be inedible.

In fairness one doesn't go to a restaurant like Boston Pizza looking for haute cuisine but at least it should be edible. A burger from McDonalds would have been better."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant experience? at this Boston Pizza. We usually have good experiences eating at Boston Pizza and this time was no exception. The food tasted phenomenal and my lemonade drink and the foundation drinks are refillable. They also offer discounts for SPC card holders. Aside from the food and their good prices, they had a really good staff. The hostess and manager were nice but our waiter, David, was one of the best waiters we've come across. Very nice, considerate, and fast. Had a great smile and he also put a smile on our faces with his behaviour and the conversations we were having with him. The girl who cleaned our table before we were sat down seemed rude with a frown on her face looking like she's not happy to be there and ignored us when we said thank you but David's company and the great food made up for it. Will definitely be back if in the area."}
{"text":"I think everyone in Calgary has been to Boston Pizza a few times. I know I have. I've had both good and not so good experiences. My latest visit was of the latter kind. The restaurant side was busy the Saturday night we were there so my friend and I ate in the bar which was actually very quiet. Our server wasn't that attentive and only checked on us once during the entire meal. I ordered the chicken manicotti which the only word I can use to describe it was strange. First, the sight was something out of an alien movie. It was almost a bright orange color. I kept thinking what the heck is this? Is it radioactive? I was soon to find out. It just tasted weird, unlike any manicotti I've ever had. It's hard to describe the exact taste but it wasn't what I expected nor what I found that pleasing. Sorry BP, but this choice off the menu should never even be offered. It was very disappointing as I was really looking forward to a good plate of pasta. Wish I could have a do-over."}
{"text":"I wish I could give half a star, because 1 is too many.

Now before I get started I should state that I understand that Boston Pizza isn't the epitome of fine dining, but this one is unreal.

To start with, the restaurant was virtually empty, but it took over 30 minutes for us to be seated because 'ummm,.. we're still waiting for a table'.

The service was incredibly slow and horrid, the appetizers were okay, but they didn't bring us side plates which is inconvenient. Drink refills? Forget it.

The main course came out much too late, they forgot my gravy and the burger tasted like something warmed up in a dirty microwave in the employee break room.

When it was time to cut our loses and pay the bill, I gave my card to the girls at the door, as the waitress was nowhere to be found, and they rang me through, and then proceeded to ignore me for 5 minutes until I finally had to ask for my receipt.

I would rather eat a Hygard sub from the gas station then go to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"We were disappointed by the perogie pizza. You try to take a slice and all the toppings come off. Not nearly as spicy as the one in shawnessy either. It was delicious when we tried it in shawnessy.

Service was very efficient, granted it wasn't busy at all, especially for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Been ordering from them for 15+ years. Used them for company party's and meetings. NOT ANYMORE!! Found out they have been overcharging us all this time. Shady business, but the food had been going down hill anyways."}
{"text":"The pizza is above average but out of the 3 closest downtown, this place throws Albo out of the water, and comparable to Pizza Rock. Service is fast, reasonable and they accept cash as Pizza Rock does not.. For this place just keep it simple as the cheese and pepperoni are amazing just as is."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 7 adults and 2 babies.  They accommodated us really well by helping us set up a table with extra room to put a stroller.  Most of us ordered pizzas and they were good.  Pizzas are sized as individual, small, medium and large.  They recommend the small for 1-2 people.  I would say it's a good size for the average adult male.  

We had a coupon from the Entertainment Book that says if we order two entrees, we can have a free appetizer (up to a value of $8).  When we presented this coupon to to server, she was unsure whether she could accept it so she went to ask her manager.  The manager came over and informed us that pizzas are not considered entrees and that this coupon cannot be used.  I asked her what pizza is considered and she said it's a meal....  She was nice enough to allow us to use this coupon this time though!  FYI, entrees are only items such as pasta and steaks.

To end, food was average, service was good."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had in all Canada! Unfortunately I went there 2 times and both times food was not fresh and quality was so poor !"}
{"text":"Good Afternoon Vegas!

I'm sure you are all busy and wouldn't want to read this, but...  I am proud to say that Boston Pizza has stepped it up!!!  The food is great and the customer service has improved! Way to go.

BTW... If you are in Vegas \"What happens in Vegas DOES NOT STAY in Vegas\"

Lol :)"}

{"text":"Its our first time in this location and will most likely be our last. Food is pricey and was expected. We ordered fettuccini alfredo with chicken and theres absolutely no taste. The pasta is bland and plain. Hawaiian pizza is decent.  
Worst part about experience here is how rude the staff are.  We had to ask for plates and utensils and the girl seemed so annoyed. No one came at all to check on us.  Very poor service.  Will not recommended."}

{"text":"Everything about this place is horrible. Awful food, awful service, just bad. I rarely get what I ordered. I feel like all boston pizzas are going downhill but this one takes the cake. I decided to give it one more shot last Tuesday, my friend and I decided to order a cheese pizza, simple! Nope, it was under cooked and the cheese was just barely melted, gross."}
{"text":"This place used to be a good place,came with couple friend on Thursday July 20,food tooks over 35 minutes ( starter) ,we ordered couple pitchers of beer and it was flat beer when we ask to server (his name was Ryan I guess)  what the problem is and he brought his manager and she told us we have to pay for half pitcher ,I don't understand why should I have to pay for the thing which was not serve right way,I ordered couple more appetizer tooks over 40 minutes, worst experience,we spend over$225 but We didn't enjoy,server was good but need to change that lady manager , she don't know anything about hospitality,I have been working with same industry over 18 years but this is the worst experience of my life I ever had,not a good place anymore"}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. Instead of the restaurant I choose the bar so I could watch the game. When you walk in you notice they have a lot of TVs located upstairs and downstairs. The sound is awesome, they'll change the volume setting for you if you ask and also switch TV channels if you have a certain sport you want to watch.

The beer collection isn't all that great but they do have name brands which is good. I ordered chicken wings while I was there. They were awesome! And very saucy! The bartender asked how I'd like them cooked \"baked or deep fried\" I never had that option before which is awesome if you don't like eating deep fried stuff. 

I think this a great spot for a quick pint. Awesome service, big menu, lots of TVS and slot machines!"}
{"text":"One of my go to bars, the dine in experience was 10/10, loved it! And would recommend to any of you guys. 

P. S. You should try out the new Pizza Bella it's  THE BEST!"}
{"text":"My friends and I just got done partying and were starving!  We were craving pizza and hot wings and all the pizza places I tried searching were closed.  This place was still open at 2am and they delivered.  Score!  

Not really.  I put my order in and was told they don't deliver to our location, the Flamingo side, which was where our hotel was, so we cancelled our order.  Then I tried looking for other places, but there weren't any open, so we said forget it, let's just go pick it up.  We put our oder in again, and drove to the Stratosphere side of Sin City and although this place is on the sketchy side of town, it was open!

We picked up our large pepperoni pizza and 10 hot wings for about $23, which was cheap compared to eating at a Vegas restaurant, and the two of us enjoyed every bite of Boston Pizza and wings :)  My sister had passed out and was unable to enjoy it til the next morning, which was still pretty good.  We had to throw the other half box of pizza away.  We should've just gotten the medium but for another $2, we upgraded to large.

This pizza joint gets 5 stars for being the only place in Vegas to open in the middle of night, with cheap prices, and good food."}
{"text":"The very definition of a tourist trap. 

Perhaps not so much of the fact it is a Boston Pizza but of *where* it is located and price point. As I am certain this place owes a fairly large chunk of its business due to its price point, tourists and lots of Blue Jay's fan traffic.

How do I know this? I used to work nearby and witnessed two up-market restaurants on the same location fail due to their overzealous yet misguided ambitions and menus. As they were not able to entice those sweet, sweet tourist, and sport fan dollars. They were too classy to get those folks in the door. 

Sure, those places got a lot of money from us, the locals, especially when it came to drinks but not many used to stay to eat. So, both places used to look pretty empty outside happy hours. Which any restaurant manager will tell you, too many empty tables make for some negative psychological and bottom line expectations. So they floundered. Not to mention that back then, the area was a bit more sparse as it lacked that long line of condos set like dominos all over the area. 

This BP has been there for about 5 years and it does not seem like it is going anywhere. The interior is: \"Sports bar tacky\" with lots of bright colors (Go BLUE for blue jays) and a few TVs above the bar. The decor is a bit-too-hip-for-school-yet-sort-of-trying-too-hard or perhaps it is a misguided \"modern\" take on a sports bar theme, I am honestly not sure. 

However, if you come here, you should come for the pizza. They are tasty, far from healthy and quite a treat. 

They are basically the Pizza Hut of Millennials. 

All gooey, a bit greasy, full of taste and yet never able to fully abandon that mass-produced vibe it comes with. Once in a while, they are fine.  

My partner in crime and I went for the Spicy Perogy as that is the one we normally get when we drop by BP about every two years or so.

If you are a BP fan, and like a pizza of theirs or two, then do come down as there are not too many locations downtown, just don't come for the decor, come for the company and tasty, if fatty pizza. 

Sometimes they have cheap beer specials... However, most of it is for Molson Canadian an American beer. (°°)"}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is like most big chains, reliably average. The service will be decent, the food will be decent, there aren't likely to be big surprises in either direction. They are fairly kid-friendly in most locales, which is a good thing if you're a parent.

I can't honestly recommend you go out of your way to this Boston Pizza or any Boston Pizza, but if you live near here, there's a reasonable chance that you'll end up going here anyway."}
{"text":"Delivery time frame wasn't terrible.
Thin crust was thin.
Extra cheese was non-existent.
Ranch is awful.  Get the garlic sauce....
All in all nice to get a pizza delivered.  If you want great pizza keep looking.."}
{"text":"I came here since a group decided to come. I hadn't eaten at the chain in a few years and was hoping they would at least slightly have improved their menu and the low-quality, often frozen food.

There seemed to be no significant changes on the menu. The burger I ordered was distinctly average an nothing beyond fast food, if not even below a couple places. I remember they had chip cut fries which they call 'cactus fries', and ordered them. Those are pretty good. All the food at the table looked very plain without any real colour, life or inspiration to it. One person said the side salad was old and tasteless. No one had a dish that had me jealous and wishing that I'd ordered it.

The food still was somewhat passable, and we had good service; but when I saw the bill it went back downhill. The burger was supposed to be on special for about $11, but it was listed at nearly $14 on the bill. I asked the server and she said it was due to the substitution of the 'cactus' fries over the regular ones. Really?!? over $2 charge for the same food item being cut differently? (done mechanically in a factory elsewhere no doubt) They charged $3.50 for my Pepsi. A bit excessive and it's not like rising food costs have affected carbonated beverages. A $20 bill before tip for such a mediocre burger combo - supposedly on special, was a waste.

I've noticed some other chains that I associate with similarly plain food have either started disappearing (Appleby's) or have begun to improve and reinvent themselves (Kelsey's). I hope BP does some soul-searching and picks up their act, because I can't see many people continuing to come here when there's increasingly better options within the same price range."}
{"text":"I had the potato skin and French onion soup.. Both yummy but I thought they could of given u a bit more for that price ..."}
{"text":"Good selection of food choices, fairly decent service. Server staff could make more effort to check in more with customers, refill waters and bill distribution took a fair amount of time."}
{"text":"If you're a resident in Las Vegas and aren't taking advantage of the Tuesday pizza special, you might kill yourself after you try their pies. I don't know if it's because I'm from closer to the east coast or perhaps their pizza is just that good. My household used to choose between here, BWW, and WS for the Tuesday specials, and The Mighty Boston Pizza has been prevalent time after time. I wouldn't even speak down on appearance or upkeep inside the shop because I feel like any change could potentially affect the quality of the food. Call me superstitious or whatever you like but I wouldn't risk it with this place. I think we customers could definitely appreciate some southbound access onto Las Vegas Blvd from the parking lot though because when I pick up food for my family, every moment counts. Also noticed the majority of the lights around the building weren't lit. 

PS: You'd be blown away how far they deliver."}
{"text":"Very bad experience this time . Pizza not fresh look like reheated very dry . Burger bread Is very cold cheese not melted and dry cold very bad .and service very slow . And unfriendly ."}
{"text":"Wow great service great food very impressed that a corporate chain restaurant delivered the quality food and service.  Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is a one-trick pony for me. I only ever get one thing (Spicy Perogy pizza, no bacon, sour cream on the side). I come to this location because it is close to my place and always empty if there's no major sporting event going on. Both service and quality of the pizza is hit-or-miss depending on when you go, which is typical of most chain restaurants.

The pizza is tasty though. Seriously, spicy potatoes and sour cream on pizza. Delish."}
{"text":"Boston pizza here is the same as other locations in terms of design and concept. Sports bar feel with a bit of class. 

I got the pizza and wasn't a big fan. It tasted unseasoned and plain. I've had the pastas and desserts which are a lot better, but still wouldn't be my go to. There's not a lot of things on the menu except pastas, burgers and pizza. 

It's a great place to get a beer with your friends over the weekend (or a green beer for St Patties!). During game nights it does get crowded and loud. The staff here is nice but during busy times, can forget about you."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've had it's insane how they managed to still stay open"}
{"text":"Only the child's pizza was good, child burgers were reheated patties with dried buns. Our expensive salads were slimy, wilted lettuce.

Come on Jim Treiveiling, President we were so disappointed. Up your game here. Never returning to a Boston Pizza again."}
{"text":"My experience with Boston Pizza in the past hadn't been great.  It had been about 5 years since my last visit to a Boston Pizza.  

Decided to give them a try again, and was quite happy with our first meal back.  

I had the Steak Sandwich, steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Portion on the fries could have been bigger and I would have preferred the steak to have 2 pieces of bread and not open faced, but still really liked it.  

Service was excellent."}

{"text":"I ordered Boston Pizza online for the first time after seeing a commercial on tv.  There were 5 of us and we decided to pig out.
Food just didn't appeal to me.  Pasta tasted bland and I'm just not a fan of their pizza.  Wings were good though.  Also pricey for what you get.

Order was wrong and I complained via email.  Manager was very quick to respond and wanted to make it right with a gift card but I declined, as I won't be back."}
{"text":"When I arrived, the place was basically dead on a Wednesday and I can see why.  The service was not the greatest.  I waited for a good ten minutes with my menu closed, even after I said to the waitress I would order right away.

When my order did clone out it was not cooked to what I wanted.   I had others join me and the time they waited was excessive as well."}
{"text":"The most shittiest service ever from ALL FRONT STAFF. Went here back in February for a birthday dinner. 

It wasn't busy at all. Didn't make reservations. 

*MIND YOU, 1 of my friends USED to work for Boston Pizza. 

We are a party of 8. There was a table on the lower level and it was dirty. We wanted to sit there and we weren't allowed. Spoke to the manager and she didn't allow us - they did not give us a reason as to why were not able to sit there. They DIDN'T CLEAN the table for the rest of the evening (even when we left the restaurant). 

We got sat in 2 different booths (YAY..). I don't remember our server's name. But he's tall, dark complexion, buzz cut). Service is terrible, we were missing components from our dish such as garlic bread. We only knew we were missing things because my friend worked there. Food took a really long time to come (app. 40 mins for only appetizers and over an hour for our main dishes). Server forgot to bring our drinks. We asked for Coke 3 times and he never brought it out. 

The service was taking too long that our group had to leave (4/8 people). Since it's my friends bday, I asked him to bring out a dessert for him with a candle. He assured me MULTIPLE times that he will..he NEVER DID. We paid our bill and tipped him 20% cause I thought he was going to do it for my friend regardless of his shitty service. 

SO FRUSTRATED AND UPSET ABOUT THE COMPANY AND EMPLOYEES.

Boston Pizza is about overpriced food, garbage service, the manager was not helpful either, and no sense of acknowledgement to guests.

Never coming back to Boston Pizza out of my interests and will tell friends/ colleagues about my horrible experience."}
{"text":"Ordered from here on the recommendation of the night staff at the Stratosphere.

Me (drunk): \"Hey guys.  So, uh, who can I call to get some pizza delivered this late.
Them (not drunk): \"bork bork bork Boston Pizza bork bork bork, bork bork bork *hands me menu*\"
Me: \"Huh?  Boston pizza?\"
Them: \"Affirmative bork\"
Me: \"... thanks man... I really need to get some food in me, all I've had to eat since I woke up today was beer.  I can barely understand what you're saying.  And I'm from Boston, too, man.  I'm wicked excited.\"
Them: \"Ha ha ha ha ha, bork bork bork bork bork.\"  One of the agents interjects, \"ominous bork bork bork.\"
Me: \"*looks at menu* WOW, look at all this... pizza.  Wow.  So much pizza.  This is nuts.  Eleven bucks?  That's cheap!  Thanks guys!\"

I called up and fumbled my way through ordering a large pizza with extra sauce, extra cheese, and black olives - my standard pizza, in the process confusing the hell out of the poor guy on the other end of the phone and apologetically told him that I was extremely intoxicated.  Now, for the life of me, I seriously cannot remember what exactly the ominous note that the front desk agent threw in, but it may have been one of the following:

1. Extra cheese was probably unnecessary.  Jeeeeeesus christ, that pizza had a metric freakin' ton of cheese on it.
2. The cheese, while not BAD, was lowest-common denominator mozzarella and mega greasy.  Considering that I had like 32lbs of it on my pizza, this made for a pretty greasy pie.
3. Extra sauce was also probably unnecessary.  The sauce was pretty thick and rich as it was.  A little on the acidic and salty side, but not bad.
4. The crust was actually about as cooked as I liked it, meaning that it was pretty lightly done rather than crispy.  The dough, however, was a bit sweeter and tangier than I expected.
5. Although it really was not a bad pizza, it was not a Boston-style pizza - it doesn't have the Boston/NY-style thin/foldable crust... it's pretty standard, rest-of-America-style pizza.

All told, while it wasn't hardly the best pizza I've ever had, it was precisely what I wanted at that moment: a simple pizza as ballast for all of the alcohol in me... the sort of pizza that's always there when you need it, like that bro who's kind of thick, but always has your back and keeps the engine running out front, you know?  The pizza passed the hangover test, too: it was still alright when I stumbled out of bed mumbling about winning a Camaro the next morning even though it wasn't refrigerated (w00t, keepin' it classy), and I didn't actually end up eating again until fairly late the following night because it was probably the most fattening thing I'd eaten in at least a couple months."}

Here I am today to celebrate a bday of a friend who works late night and only few of us can make it. Arrive at 12. Our hostess katelynn tells us today we are doing last call early around 12.20. Clearly web site says open till 1. I tell her we have friends joining from other part of town. We will order drinks for them. She says well I can give u some drinks as long as you are out by 12.45. Wooooow. Really! !! Is this her apartment she pays lease for ? Or a franchise. I especially like the part where when I asked her name the second time. She said Mary Anne.

Maybe just one of the newer things on the menu that wasn't a win?. The manager at the front counter was excellent though, that's why it gets 3 stars, other wise it would have been a 2 as our server wasn't the friendliest."}

Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I came here for the Jays home opener. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, spacious and has lots of seating space for large groups. I like the coloured lights and the large side windows. Prices are fair, my boyfriend and I highly recommend the potato steak pizza if you enjoy bbq sauce. Skip the salad, and order a pizza or wings instead for a better value. This is a good place to get a meal before watching a game. Watching the game itself at this restaurant was a bit dull. (I'm assuming most people would want to come here to watch a game because of all the televisions). Not the same enthusiastic or full crowd as the other bars. The volume was turned a bit down during the game too."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a bite to eat after a movie.  Friendly service and we were seated promptly.  The bar was really busy so we sat in the dining area.  There was some UFC event on the tv and that was generating a lot of screaming and cheering.

We ordered individual size Hawaiian and half sized Mediterranean chicken salad.  Drinks came promptly and the food was fresh and perfectly tasty. Our server was friendly and attentive and we couldn't ask for more.

The only complaint is all the smokers hanging around right outside the entrance.  They really need to enforce the smoking distance from the front unless they want all patrons walking through a 4 foot wall of smoke."}

The food was hot, fresh & super tasty. Clean establishment also. I really have no negative comments about this place & will definitely go back for more amazing pizza"}
{"text":"We went to this new branch 2 times. The service was slow and the food was garbage. The worst Boston Pizz I've ever been to."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and i regret ever going. The waitresses are rude and not respectful to the customers and treat younger customers much differently then elderly.
The food is rarely up to par and i definitely do not recommend"}
{"text":"Came in here on a whim after some quick shopping.
Sat in the lounge and let me tell you, the service at the bar although not busy, was stellar. 5 stars for the service. V, you were worth the 'more than usual' tip!
Drinks were good, spicy perogy pizza even better, cooked to perfection. Nothing like a little carb on carb action as my salad I ordered from somewhere else today sits in the trunk of my car :) At least you can get it on multi-grain crust! Worth the calories and the cash. Yum.
Had a relaxing period of time in here (yep, at BP) and were glad we stopped in. I have been here a couple of times before but the visits were forgettable.
This is a great place to come before or after the movies or a great way to kill some time on a Sunday afternoon once the Mall closes and rest your weary feet. (6pm)
Will happily return!"}
{"text":"There is no other place I know of to get a spicy perogy pizza - BP just has it!
You know the place food-wise is ok when the staff are eating the food from the kitchen in the lounge at the bar!
Good service and friendly staff here. The lounge has the biggest TV I have ever seen, and many other scattered ones around too. As well, I noticed some VLTS.
Had a drink and got a pizza to go as we were conducting some banking in the same plaza. Tons of businesses in this area and lots of parking.
We were not disappointed whatsoever when we got the cold pizza home! Delicious hot or cold, the spicy cactus is served with sour cream and is delectable. 
A small pizza is not cheap at $17 but once in awhile it is worth the splurge."}
{"text":"If I could rate this \"no stars\" I would. Its funny to see that this place haven't changed since I've been here 6 years ago. 

6 years ago, ordered a salad and there was a fly in it. Complained to the waitress and she told me to flick it off. Vowed to never come back.

Unfortunately, we were in the neighbourhood and decided to come here for lunch out of convenience . I ordered pizza bread not knowing that there was actually two items on the menu that's called pizza bread. The waiter brought out the wrong one. Partly my fault because I didn't specify, but he should have asked. I told him this isn't what I wanted but he didn't say anything. So we asked if there's any sauce for it, and settled with pizza sauce. Contemplated that I wouldn't eat the cardboard tasting Boston Pizza Bread I asked for an order of the Bandera Pizza Bread. He brought out the sauce and then my order. We told him to take away the first order, barely touched.

At the end of it all we were charged for the pizza sauce and for the wrong order. Outraged we had a talk with the manager.
It shouldn't even have to come to that point. 

All in all:
HORRIBLE customer service, waiter didn't give two cents about customer. Should probably get another job."}
{"text":"NEVER COMING BACK. FOOD SUCKS SERVICE SUCKS.  GO ELSEWHERE . 

If I could give it no stars I would.  I'm surprised this place isn't closed yet.

We know it's always dead so we went here to watch ufc and for a surprise birthday . I reserved specifying that it would be for a birthday TO WATCH UFC. She said okay. 

13-14 people came and paid 5$ cover .sure that's a small price to pay.  It wasn't until we sat down and ordered drinks that they THEN notified us of a $25 min charge. Why weren't informed prior? Anyways whatever.  We had nowhere else to go.  Okay.

The waitress was horrible.  We had to request multiple times for the same items (napkins, refills, etc). She's busy okay whatever.  It's packed. We understand. Irritated but we'll let it slide.

We finished eating and I had requested multiple times for her to clear the table and bring out the cake. She dissapears for half hour.  No where to be seen.  We asked other staff and they had no clue. The main fight is about to start... we r getting very angry at this point. People from the table were leaving because they have to wake up early. The birthday boy figured out we had gotten him a cake. There goes any 'surprise' She comes back smelling like cigarettes and then tells us she's bringing it out now. Like wtf. Dude.  

At this point everyone is done. The birthday sucks. The only thing that saved us from walking out was Lesnar. 

Beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"Their pizza is average and the prices are above average. Slow and rude service. Overall this place sucks"}
{"text":"I remember eating at Boston Pizza back in Hawaii years ago.  I remember it being really good and having huge slices.  I went to their website and WHOA! Two for Tuesdays....guess what day it was when I found out  Boston Pizza was in Vegas? The stars must've aligned and it was fate....unless you are one of those that believe that there is too much randomness and coincidence in the world to conclude a causal relationship between the day, the stars, and pizza.  Anyway, I got the signature Boston Pizza, large. My free pizza for this deal was a large Pepperoni. I had pizza for almost a week! Yeah, 16\" pizzas may not be much, but these guys are generous with their toppings! Heck I ate this the next morning for breakfast (cold, the second best way to eat pie) and I also did the pizza warm up trick on the stove where you place the slice on the pan to reharden the crust and warm up the toppings at the same tiime. The pizza doesn't taste \"corporate\" (e.g. Pizza Hut or Dominos).  I don't know, it's like homemade pizza without the fail.  Heads up, you will end up parking next to Olympic Gardens so I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Tried here for lunch.
We got custom pizza, caeser salad and shrimp linguine. Pizza was good, caeser salad had a lot more portion than expected. However, the pasta was bland therefore rating 3 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst pizza and worst service I have ever had from a pizza place. We were told that our order would take 15 minutes, an hour and a half later we got pizza that was so hard it literally cracked the box when we threw it back in. 
The delivery man was super rude. When he finally found our hotel he blamed the wait on us. I would have been okay with his attitude if it was at least good pizza. I didn't know it was possible for to make bad pizza until I ate Bostons pizza."}
{"text":"Im here more often than i would like. My local bar to drink a schooner and laugh around with the co-workers

Love the bar area. Big screens everywhere and I almost find a seating every time."}
{"text":"After a busy weekend my parents and myself were craving pizza so we headed to a local BP looking forward to some tasty Za.  Thank God there pizza was delicious because that was the only thing that was pleasant about out evening. 

We arrived at the BP just before 7pm and were told that we would be sitting quicker if we were to sit in the Bar, we declined as the TV's are always distracting. We were told that it would about a 15min wait, despite having 6 set up tables and 2 set up booths.  We patiently waiting for our table as the Hostess shuffled around and cleaned tables as 2 groups of people left.  Finally we were sat down and I asked our mighty hostess why we couldn't have sat in one of the already prepared tables?  We were told that they were busier than last year and if she sat us too quick the server may have been overwhelmed and \"crashed\".  Ok, I guess I can understand that, but they missed the opportunity for all of us to have a Pint while we waiting at a TABLE instead in the waiting area with two other groups of people. 

We already knew what we wanted because we LOVE the pizza at BP and only ordered water.  Our well dressed, short skirted sexy waitress had the personality of a dish rag, thank god she was good looking because thats all she had going for her.  

Just as our food came I finished my water and was not refilled until I asked as I got our bill. 

I don't feel like I ask for a lot out of a chain like Boston pizza, but when the service is so terrible it's hard to focus on your meal.  Pizza is always the same, so that alone is a  4/5 experience, but this place filled with stupid employees really turned me off.

Will never go back to this BP. 
17th Ave from now on."}
{"text":"Always understaffed in the lounge area at this location and sometimes takes awhile to get noticed. Food very inconsistent - one day the burger will be OK, the next visit will be terrible (burned). My husband sticks to the Whiskey Burger. The sauce is actually quite good. I always stick to the pizza as Boston Pizza just cannot do pasta dishes. The pizza crust is alright but the toppings are not plentiful - expensive pizza for what you get. If you have kids, the dining room would be the place for you. The lounge is good for adults-only eats but ambiance is lacking for say, date-night. Too many TVs but I guess it fits a sports-bar-lounge definition.
Not a bad stop for an average quickie meal that will fill you up and some days the beer specials are good if you are looking for a cold pint."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go when it is late and your options are limited. Just know that nothing is fresh here unless you order a pizza. The dough is made fresh everyday, sometimes twice a day on a busy night. And yes, it is overpriced. I did like this location better than the Symons Valley location. For this given night the service was a lot better, we did not have loud, live music messing up our convo and M's burger was not cooked down to a burned piece of charcoal! I was craving pasta but I know this is a no-no here - they make it way too bland so I opted for an individual multi grain crust spicy perogie pizza. Not that spicy but you can add some chiles to it - not bad at all. M's burger was the bomb though - that whiskey sauce, wowie and his burger was cooked nicely! His yam fries were good too, extra charges apply of course.
All in all, it was what we were looking for as far as eats for a late Fri night where Asian food was just not going to cut it again. Tons of TVs here if you are into that. Apparently they get quite busy on pay per view Cage Fight nights. Ugh, I will for sure skip that party but to each to their own! No live music at this location and for us, this was kind of a blessing."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Boston Pizza in a while, after some Black Friday shopping we went to get some lunch. The restaurant was pretty much empty, so we got seated right away. We wanted to get some drinks, so we ordered Sangria. We got the Sangria first which wasn't that great, it did not taste like what a Sangria taste like. We were debating on what food to get after tasting the Sangria. One of the waitress mentioned to get the pasta, we customized it to just chicken. The food was amazing! BUTTTT... as we were enjoying the food, I noticed a FLY in my Sangria. :O. I told the waitress and she made it seem like she was not even fazed. She also mentioned that this has happened before. Ahh whattt, I was a little taken back when she told us this. So we ate what he wanted and asked for the bill. The waitress charged us full price for the Sangria even after the fly in it and that we didn't even drink all of it. The manager only gave us a 50% off but didn't come out at all to say sorry or whatever. We left and I don't think I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I had a business lunch meeting and we settled on Boston Pizza because we needed plugs for our laptops. We were greeted courteously by their hostess and were seated immediately at a table with an outlet -that's amazing because it was lunchtime too!  The staff there was amazing: very polite, accommodating and friendly: they did not seem to mind my questions about their vegetarian/ vegan options. I ended up ordering the BP Bundle for $9: I had a cup of minestrone soup as a starter -it was ok, not that memorable; yam fries a a side -one of my favorites, sadly they only gave me a small amount, and it's a SWEET POTATO not yam; and their Greek Stromboli as my entree, sans feta cheese with extra sauce. The Stromboli was a good size, not too big or small, which was good because I was full from the starters. It was also very fresh, tasty and satisfying. The food came quickly and was HOT when it arrived -which is excellent and very impressive. Needless to say, I enjoyed my lunch meeting at this Boston Pizza and the BP Bundle. One very important thing I learned from my waitress: -the Boston Pizza dough is VEGAN friendly, meaning NO MILK or EGG products included. I'm definitely see myself visiting a Boston Pizza again -I'm not a big fan of franchised establishments, so this says alot!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch some UFC fights with friends.Two of their projectors were out of commission, but other than that the t.v placement was good enough for us to have a decent view. Food was alright.The Meteor and pepperoni pizzas were pretty good. The appetizer platter we had before was horrible though. Service was very friendly and accommodating. I may  return."}
{"text":"Had a work meeting here group of 20. Our waitress was nice and brought us English and French menus.

Drinks came quickly and they gave pitchers of water for our table. All soft drinks are free refills.

Service was as quick as possible for how many we were. 7:30-9:30.

Poutine was extremely salty and I never say that so just be aware. Pizzas didn't look that good minus the perogi one.

Even tho the place only got a 1.5 and I didn't chose it, it wasn't as bad as people made it seem and I came to this location twice and had bad experiences as well.
If you're going for a hoity toity meal you're in the wrong spot. Keep simple (pizza burgers and apps)"}
{"text":"Ordered the wings fries and pizza, amazing meal!, wings to die for fries greasy with a crunch and pizza superb. Definitely recommend and will be going back"}
{"text":"So this Boston Pizza location has the highest ceiling of any Boston Pizza location I've visited. It also had some of the youngest wait staff I've seen, as well as some of the youngest clientelle (with their parents). The food was the standard Boston Pizza fare of any such location but the fact that the server didn't understand that a diet soda meant a diet cola or diet pop seemed like an odd thing. And one of us noticed a staff member sitting on the counter in the kitchen which didn't seem very hygenic. The bathrooms were the most children friendly of Boston Pizza locations as there was a stool to help folks reach the sink if they were not otherwise tall enough."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious and service friendly for a chain restaurant.

Me and a few friends came to this Boston Pizza a few month back and decided to have a quick meet up and dinner. I ordered their new pepperoni and bacon pizzaburger (#diabetes). I didn't have much expectation due to experiences at other chain restaurants, however the food tasted like it was freshly made/baked. 

The service was also very friendly and helpful when we asked them questions about menu items. One of my friends knew one of the waiters and we even got a 10% discount !"}
{"text":"I'm always amazed at how consistent B.P. service really is.  I've been to dozens everywhere, and they've managed to be quite crappy in all of them.

We were there almost exactly a year ago, and the service was so crappy (along with the mediocre food) I swore I'd avoid this place if possible... but last night because of a last minute get together, we hit this place up again.

Again, took forever before someone came around to take our drink orders.  Then only some of our drinks came and we had to remind our server what was ordered.  Food took like a whole period of hockey before it showed up.  Took a while to find someone to get our bills.   We wanted to get separate bills, but she dropped it in front of us saying she couldn't figure it out, so put it all together.

BANNED!"}
{"text":"Salads are okay, but the hot food is not worth it. We came with a big group of people - very little meat in sandwiches, pizza was burnt, buns were dry, etc. unfortunately the server also forgot all my instructions( just less spice and no shrimp in my jambalaya fettuccine). Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is THE place I go to for pasta. I've been here well over 10 times. I'm a very price conscious eater. I ONLY come on a Tuesday. If you love pasta and don't want to shell out $18-25 for a dish, I recommend Boston Pizza. Tuesday Pasta is only $10.99. On Tuesday you can also add a ceasar salad for just $2.49. The salad is huge and good for 2 people or 1 really big eater. Their pasta is very good value and taste. I've been to several \"fancy\" Italian restaurants and their pasta sucked. For the price I pay, their dish is so small and doesn't have a lot of ingredients. I don't like paying a large premium for the atmosphere unless I\"m trying to impress someone (which is rare of me). 

Boston Pizza is a franchise and has your typical sports bar/family restaurant atmosphere. But not that it matters to me. I only care about the food and the price. If you're into sports, they have several big TVs that you can watch. Their service is alright. If they ask if you want cheese on your garlic bread, REMEMBER THAT THEY CHARGE YOU $2.5 for it. I had a server who did not disclose that to me and I was a little pissed. 

I find that other franchise sports/family restaurants like Jack Astor have more limited selection of pastas. Jack Astor is not a bad restaurant at all. I'm just saying I like Boston Pizza is great because it's the only restaurant near my home with a good pasta special on a good selection of pasta. They have classics like chicken mushroom fettuccine and my favourite, the Jambalaya fettuccine. 

Their namesake dish - pizza, was not impressive. I tried their pizza once and I'll never do that again. The problem with reviewing pizza is that it's what I consider a \"simple\" dish. It's like chicken fingers. I can buy a pack of chicken fingers and some fries from the grocery store and make the same dish myself. It's not that hard to screw up pizza (it's harder than chicken fingers and fries but certainly easier to make than many dishes that require careful seasoning and cooking). The pizza here is certainly better than places like Pizza Pizza but the price premium they charge does not justify it."}
{"text":"Pizza was late and showed up cold...like it had been sitting at room temp. For about an hour. Will NEVER order here again!

Decided to give the place one more try. BIG MISTAKE! Pizza arrived 40 min late. Of coarse this one was also cold. Not only was this one cold, but it was also burnt! Obviously they do not take these complaints very seriously. If they did they wouldn't do the same thing 2 days later to the exact same person!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say, that both the quality of the food and service have gone down tremendously over the years. I was reminded of that again tonight. Though the restaurant was not busy at all, we had to wait our server long time before we could order anything...servers gather in the kitchen mingling with kitchen staff instead of waiting on tables...never going back"}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is going downhill, very sad.

It used to be a place where we find it relax for casual dinning. However, the food and alcohol are overpriced.

We ordered yam fries, pork ribs and chicken wings. The yam fries is very mediocre, we only ate 1/4 of it. But the pork ribs are even wrose! Very blend, almost no sauce, and totally flavorless. It was $17.99 for half rack and there's only 4 bones and very little meat. What a rip off! 

The wings are the only thing that taste normal. We had it fried with honey garlic sauce. But you can find cheaper priced wings at All-star or St. Louis.

Unless they give me a free meal, I will never go back to Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend for lunch. 

Our waitress was friendly and kept tabs on us throughout our stay. The food was okay, but could be better. The baked chipotle bacon penne was very bland and plain, but the pesto chicken penne was alright. Both came with two garlic bread, which had the option for cheese on it.

I would come back here, but would try other dishes."}
{"text":"The kitchen chose to chop up rotten Brussels sprouts in my BBK salad instead of telling me they were out of ingredients. 'Nuff said. Ewwwwwwww"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, our server was very attentive. Disappointed that you couldn't order the kale & Brussels sprout salad without the bacon. It's all pre-mixed. My salad that I did order had way too much salad dressing on it. Couldn't eat it all because it was swimming on my plate."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around 5 pm,place is clean,wasn't too packed ,I ordered a taco plate and it looked like a giant salad ,tacos were all lettuce ,chicken had no taste ,tasted bland ....wake up guys for 15.95 your selling a Mexican chicken salad ..not impressed"}
{"text":"On yet another business trip to Calgary, I had the opportunity to stay in the motel village.  I arrived at the hotel at 8pm, starving and famished.  After dropping my stuff I bolted into BP.  I must have resembled Lionel, their Mascot, and Cookie Monster's third cousin.

This was my first time eating at a Boston Pizza outside of Ontario, though I have eaten at their US cousin Boston's.  Though the restaurants look similar there was a certain \"je ne sais quois\" different about this location.

The hostess asked me how she could help me, and I requested a table and a menu. A couple of minutes later I met my waitress who promptly took my drink order.

For the main course I ordered the Jalepeno and Crispy Onion Prime Rib Burger with a side of Cactus Cut Potatoes.

First lets start with the Cactus cut potatoes.  As a famished man, they lasted only a few minutes.  If I were critical I would say they were slightly more oily than I would have wanted, but the dipping sauce made me forget about that issue.

On to the Burger.  It was big, full-bodied, and had a beautiful mix of crunch (crispy onions), hot (jalepenos) and gooey mmm goodness (prime rib)

I was too full for dessert.  

Overall I'm giving this three stars, I would have loved to give it 3.5.  As friendly as my server was, the food was good - its just not the same Boston Pizza experience as back home, it just wasn't quite the same experience.

I would definitely consider coming back to this location."}

never again. lil miss blondey, hope you're reading this"}
{"text":"The garlic shrimp pasta was horrible. No garlic taste at all. It was just oil and salt and small pieces of shrimps. The worst part was the pasta. It was over cooked and mushy. I think they do pizza well but not the pasta."}
{"text":"The pizzas are great. I've tried the Greek pizza (gyro meat, onion, tomato, and feta) which is generally fantastic (although the width of the meat slices very, and people have different preferences so it is unfortunate that you don't know what you're getting) and the spinach pizza (I didn't actually eat this one, but several other people have and they could not stop raving about it).

Delivery time is incredibly fast, and they deliver a good number of plates, parm, and peppers. (Don't like the guy on the phone's briskness scare you... He's just being efficient.)"}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza is one of the worst locations of this chain. I keep forgetting that I always tell myself that I won't return, because it's handy after shopping at Loblaws or Canadian Tire. The food is okay--not much different than any other Boston Pizza--but the service is below par. I get the sense that many of the servers and even the managers don't enjoy their jobs and it reflects in their level of service. I used to come here regularly but about two or three years ago something changed and it seems like many people who work there just stopped caring. For example, they seem to always want to seat me in the bar rather than the dining room (I don't know why, for convenience maybe?) even when I'm with my child, and inevitably there will be a table of loud drunk people near us, which is to be expected in a bar. When I ask to sit in the dining room, however, I feel as though I'm making some big unreasonable request. I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service.  The serve was not welcoming at all. Made us feel like she was doing us a favour by coming. Came once to check in on us and that was it. Towards the end when we got our bill, mentioned that we are part of a rewards program and we have the free kids meal from Boston pizza, the server was quick to say she knows nothing of the rewards program and just looked so miserable taking the card for free kids meal. It was really irritating as they have a sign stuck to the from reception staying they accept the rewards program and she said she knows nothing of it. Right now, the only thing they got going for them is the food  that's the only reason they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"How do I sum up this experience? Terrible Service. Mid-November at Chinook, where lunch turned into mid-afternoon lunch thanks to \"a busy kitchen\" is not what I would love to put on my list of restaurant experiences.

Everything said and done? Standard Boston Pizza food, nothing spectacular, nothing to scoff at either, it was the service that really brings this review down. A 20 minute wait for a table, when they were not that busy (1:30PM on a Saturday, and somehow six tables cleared up at once?), followed by a ten minute wait for a waiter, followed by a 40 minute wait for food (we nearly got up and left while waiting) with no server in sight, followed by the manager coming by and just saying \"sorry, the kitchen was very busy\" and then vanishing without waiting at the table for us to say anything resulted in this one-star rating."}

Bad costumer service...

Avoid!"}
{"text":"Wife and I  went to this Boston Pizza store on Oct 31 after our grand children were done with their trick/treat  and gone home with their parents. We are seniors, and we have patronized this store various times before with no issues. My wife is not a heavy beer drinker and as in the past, we ordered a 32 oz pitcher beer and she would drink a glass. I asked for a glass and the server said that the store policy has changed and that now we are not allowed to share the beer. We had to order two 12 oz separately. I asked him why can't I share the beer?  HAVE NEVER COME ACROSS SUCH A RUDE AND UNFRIENDLY SERVICE POLICY AT ANY RESTAURANT BEFORE. i asked to talk to the manager who simply reaffirmed the store policy. How much more arrogant can a restaurant be in disallowing a husband to share beer with his wife? What's next, can't share food with your wife or kids? If the store thinks they are selling the 32 oz beer too cheaply then simply raise the price of the beer. What an arrogant restaurant!! Will never step in Boston Pizza again."}
{"text":"Love this place for the west siders. 

they've got a huge patio that is perfect for the upcoming summer months, I will be here often to avoid the downtown crowd."}
{"text":"This restaurant essentially stole my money!!!

  First of all, I placed the order at 7:50 pm online and the confirmation said my pizza would be ready by 8:30. The pizza got here at 8:40 so a bit late but no big deal.  

Then I went inside to realise that my \"double\" order of chicken bites was just a single! I immediately called them back, so they were aware of the issue by 8:45pm and the restaurant is supposed to close at 11pm so I was calling back more than 2 hours ahead of closing time.  However, according to the assistant manager who I spoke with, the delivery guy had now gone home for the night so there was no way to get my 2nd order of chicken bites out to me this evening.  Nor could they deliver me the chicken bites tomorow, or the day after that because apparently they don't deliver on Mondays or Tuesdays either.  

I spent $51.46 for 8 lousy chicken bites and a large pepperoni pizza that was dry and salty.  For a place whose  namesake is \"Boston PIZZA\" the pizza was like a frozen pizza reheated in their ovens, pepperoni was cheap and overcooked. The pizza was honestly really gross. 

But back to the original story, I was offered as a condolence for omitting an order of chicken bites WHICH I PAID FOR, was to offer me 30% off a future order!!! When I said no, I don't' want to spend more money just to get something I already paid for, they offered me 50% off instead.  Like NO. NO. Essentially they have just stolen my money and given me nothing in return.  What about the chicken bites I ALREADY PAID FOR? I don' t get those anymore because they screwed up, instead, they get to keep my money and for me to maybe recoup some of it, I could you know, spend more money and order again? It's ridiculous!

This place is owned or managed or something by one of the guys on Dragon's Den- a confirmed multi millionaire investor.  Why does he need to keep my money and give me nothing in return?  For a place that claims to want to make their customers happy, they sure don't care about robbing them blind.

This was my first and last time ever ordering from Boston Pizza."}

{"text":"This has been my go-to spot for years when I'm craving spicy chicken fingers, and they never let me down. The super spicy vinegar buffalo style hot sauce makes my mouth water as I type this. I've had other things. Burgers, pizzas, even the pasta dinners they offer are all up to par and above bar food IMO. It's a decent size place that you can dine in or call in Togo. Open 24 hours and basically in the parking lot of Olympic Garden. Daily/weekly specials and great prices. Pretty sure it's a family owned and operated spot. They are always courteous, and genuinely kind. Oh and get a side of ranch no matter what you order, cuz the ranch is just that good."}

I've been supporting the past year the Queensway location to my surprise when I wanted to go eat there at 8 o'clock he indicated to me that we had to be out by 830 as he sold $10 tickets to watch a fight that doesn't even start till midnight..
I told the manager that I was a regular and then I go there once a week and spend good hard money but being a manager and not an owner he has no idea of the value of keeping the customer happy, instead he insisted you must be out at 8:30 I can tell you with certainty he not only what I fire you if I was the owner but you've just lost a customer sir"}
{"text":"Wow, worse than I expected...and I didn't expect much.  Beer selection was horrible (typical of Canada) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that's barely drinkable.  Wine selection was nearly as bad.  The Caesar salad I ordered had gobs and gobs of dressing masking any hope of flavor.  The Spicy Perogy pizza was just horrible.  Try some fresh ingredients, a hand made crust, flavor.  I had to ask for a dipping sauce just to get this crap down.  Ugh, should have just eaten at a convenience store."}

{"text":"It's been years since I ate at Boston Pizza.  The last time, the food was awful. I figured enough time has passed, they're still in business so the food has probably improved.  I was wrong!  The Hawaiian pizza is very bland.  It is also too doughy and sits like a rock in my stomach.

On the plus side, the service was fine and there's lots of parking."}
{"text":"Listen to my whole review. This place is a hole in the wall. Literally a hole in the wall, and not even a good looking one. Im the kind of guy who was raised eating at upscale restaurants and I was taught if something was wrong with your food, send it back. I stumbled in on this place before and it was on accident on my way to a damn bus stop, literally. I love small restaurants and respect places like that and I've been to a few places from Guy's Diners Drive-in's and Dives and lets be honest' if Guy gets a free meal, the place will get a good review and the places always sort of suck. Now you want over-priced wings that rock, go to wing stop and enjoy those amazing wings that destroy your wallet and are what youd expect. Its traditional with usual flavors and its a big company and yeah its good for what you get. But BOSTON PIZZA. you come to this neighborhood that looks kinda sketchy, and you step out of the car after you park and immediately your nose catches a whiff of heaven. So you want a good italian place thats not too pricy, but you want something thats worth what you pay and something that will exceed in flavoring your bite... Your tastebuds here are gonna die a little on the inside. Is it the best food? Its not for me to say but you will not, i guarantee you will not leave unsatisfied. The only complaint is that the drinks for a refill are a little much but whatever. You come in and its got a map painted on the wall of where theyve been and its incredible. The people behind the counter obviously enjoy their jobs a little too much but hey it pays the bills and the menu... Oh my god the menu is huge. Its got cheesesteaks, sandwiches, submarine sandwiches, wings, chicken fingers, pizza, calzones, pasta, desserts and more. I come in for just cheat day fries and wings and its not like theyre frozen or even like premade and reheated. Its actually made fresh, crazy flavor, its beautiful and its a restaurant i eat at very regularly. If youre visiting Vegas, youre a local looking for something new or even youre just passing through and found this review on places to eat, looking for something good. This is a good stop and its worth it. Do you think id waste my tine and post this? You think id waste all this time to actually make a review this long if i didnt really want to spread the word of this place? Jesus no. This is my home away from home and these people are my family. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"This place has by far the worst  service when it comes to delivery !! We are literally 3 miles away from them and we have guests from the convention center visiting and they told us they do not deliver in this area after 7pm how do we supposed to know that they need to update their page not to mention we are next to the convention center!! Are we serious?? We were so upset Then we called a second time and complain about it they had the manager come to the phone and he was checking our address again not to mention we had to spell the address 4 times by now and keep on putting us on hold what a mess lol .. any ways their loss I should have trusted those reviews when it comes down to their delivery!!"}
{"text":"I like this location... But only for one server! She has a slight British accent but never fails to serve me and my friends at her best. I don't even know her out of BP but she is the most friendly and prompt one there. If she isn't there... I have a hard time with the other servers as they will take a while to serve me and give me attitude/make me feel uncomfortable. 

It's unfortunate their servers are rude and snotty since this is a pretty popular place in Ajax!"}
{"text":"24 hours! Always a go to in my book. Chicken wings are great! Plus the pizza is always cheesy and hot. I take advantages of their good lunch specials during my work day.. not too bad of a delivery service either!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you a story about Boston Pizza (If you think you can actually call this pizza). On my way back to my apartment I was hungry so I decided to give Boston Pizza a shot. I ordered online to try to save a few minutes but when I got there I still had about 15 minutes before my order was going to be ready so I decided to head to the bar for a beer while I waited. But ALAS, my attempt to acquire a beer was thwarted by the evil hostess who told me the bar was full and I was relished to wait outside. While I was waiting outside several individuals walked into the bar past said evil hostess; which is understandably quite frustrating to a thirsty individual who is waiting for his (horrendously bad tasting) pizza. After waiting for my pizza I paid an atrociously high price of about $30 for a pathetically small pizza. When I got home and actually tasted the circular garbage that was provided to me, the final nail was in the coffin and I will never be going to Boston Pizza again.  Overall this was probably the worst pizza I've ever had and the highest price I've ever paid for a hunk of trash masquerading itself as pizza. For the sake of all that is holy, avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I didn't look at the reviews until I was already in the restaurant trying to get an idea of what to order. It was too late! This place SUCKS! 

We got the cactus fries - I think they were underdone or not done properly because a lot of the pieces weren't fully crispy. Then for my main I got the 7 cheese ravioli -this is the main disappointment. It was just really bland, boring, tasteless and sad. Honestly a microwaved Michelina's might've even tasted a little better. I came on a Tuesday so it was only $11.99, but if I paid the full price ($16.99?) for that I'd be really, really unhappy (even more unhappy)."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. I chose to go to Boston Pizza for my Birthday dinner with my wife and young son, we go seated quickly, it wasn't busy. It took some time for the waitress to come but she did finally come and took our drink order and appetizer. The drinks seem to take a bit and I asked if it was going to go slow but was assured it would not. We ordered our meals and I asked where the appetizer was, it was obvious she forgot, The manager finally brought the appetizer out when we were getting up to leave, instead of accepting responsibility, I was asked how long I waited, and told that it takes time to prepare the food, and that out appetizer would be free. It was too late, Not impressed at all, poor management, take ownership, accept that someone messed up, we all do from time to time. Generally like Boston Pizza but not impressed tonight at all."}
{"text":"Worst pizza experience ever.
One pizza was terribly over cooked and lacked sauce even though we had requested extra sauce. The other pizza had almost a  two inch wide crust, with toppings only in the middle.
$69 for two medium pizzas and they charged me an extra $5.25 for the extra sauce that was not on the pizza.

Terrible!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch Sunday.

Haven't been for a very long time.

Had salad and burger.  Food was okay.
Service was okay. Expensive for quality of food.
Overall luke warm."}
{"text":"The pizza is great pizza. I'm a Chicagoan who struggles with non-Chicago style pizza but this place hits it. Very close to rosatti's thin if that means anything to you. Not that flappy, soggy New York style but
Not quite deep dish. Go for the sausage and onion or the veggie with spinach. The pizza is great, but don't be put off by the staff. The staff are all jerks, low-paid jerks who really don't know the first thing about customer service. It's a dump of a restaurant. So listen, just order your pizza ahead, pay in cash (as they tend to have issues w cards), check your pie and go home to peace. Yum."}
{"text":"If you have somewhere to be afterwards or on your lunch break, don't come here. Service is SLOW. We came here because it was convenient. After work around 6pm. 5 tables full, 3 servers on the floor and yet it took 15 minutes for someone to take our order; we were ready to order after 2-3 minutes. It was maddening. But the servers were nice, so that's one redeeming quality of this restaurant. 

Their spinach and artichoke dip wasn't as good as I've tasted in other restaurants. Not enough pizza bread comes with the dip and they DROWN it in parmesan. The parmesan was all I tasted.  

We also ordered the club sandwich. The chicken had no seasoning at all, it tasted boiled. When we told the server, she said it was grilled in the oven and they don't season it for a reason. Why serve sandwiches with unseasoned, bland chicken that tastes boiled? Who knows.

I get pizza is their specialty but why have crappy food on the menu? If pizza is all they can make right then just serve pizza and no sides. They clearly can't make a simple sandwich or appetizer. And we have tasted their pizza before. It was good, but not worth $17 for a medium.

Lousy experience overall. One star, only for the nice servers."}
{"text":"Good food, kind of a weird layout as you come in on the ground floor to a lonely little host at a desk who then brings you to the actual restaurant. Can't wait until it's warm enough for the roof to open. Easily the best pizza in downtown!"}
{"text":"We came here to watch a UFC fight (Silva vs. Diaz in case you are wondering) and this place was pretty much our last resort.

I shared a large chicken BBQ pizza. The original crust was dry and tasteless. They were stingy with the toppings especially the chicken. Digiorno tastes better than this. Boston pizza surely needs to step up their game (pun intended) when it comes to food quality.

Service is alright and the waiter was very friendly. The place has the usual comfy diner booths. Free WiFi.

While this is not really a sports bar they do have TVs and a large projector and they do play PPV matches which makes it a last resort to watch a popular game where every other bar is full. But let's make one thing clear, you don't go to Boston pizza for the food!!"}
{"text":"If zero stars is an option, that was what I would vote for. I've been there multiple times, and the pasta is atrocious. The other stuff is tolerable. The toasted garlic bread us better than any of their pasta dishes. Don't be tempted to try it."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Lots of tv's in the lounge. Lots of choices, maybe too many and on top of it all the menu is not focused at all. Feels like a bunch of marketing people were all told to create a good meal and they slapped them all together. Oddly laid out but after the waitress giggled at my puzzled face of what to order, I ordered! My rating is based on food as I think there is a better selection of non fried menu items in the area for the prices charged. The waitress and staff get 5* but the food is prepackaged frozen and fried in old oil. Ps the Canadian Cesar has a piece of defrosted bacon in it which makes the drink oily and not enjoyable! Stick to regular beans and normal garnish folks!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day with some people from work. We arrived around 1140 and the place was not yet busy.  I must admit, I dont often go to BP's. I found the decor inside a bit on the dated side - very 1980 esque - but it was strangely familiar and comforting at the same time. We sat at a booth down near the front.  Our server was friendly and efficient. As a vegetarian, It sometimes is difficult to find DIFFERENT veggie options, such was the case here. I ordered their veggie burger. I wil say that I have had MANY a veggie burger over the years, and theirs was pretty good. It had BBQ sauce, feta cheese, roasted peppers - it sounds weird but was surprisingly good.  The french fries on the other hand were very typical  - nothing outstanding and not particularly warm.  The whole experience was ok, not great, however the service was fast and efficient and the food was ok.  Will I return? Not sure, but if I did, it would likely be for a pizza."}
{"text":"My favorite I love the calzonies full in flavor the best cheese will melt it all the time my preference"}
{"text":"I came here on Aug 10th for $5 personal pizza. Pretty good for $5 but honestly I wouldn't pay full price for that ($12.99).

I usually come here to watch PPV matches if all else fails. Over hyped. Tastes slightly better than fast food. This specific location is spacey and clean. Great service overall."}
{"text":"Hi, I went with my man to Boston Piizza   the other day for a   nice   Philly Cheesesteak. It was big, juicy, brought half home. Lots of veggies to put on it. It was the best Philly Cheese steak I ever had. There Pizza is not what it used to be like Years back, but the Cheesesteak, oh  yeah, gotta have it. I walked into it. Walking love it, and everyone is friendly it s very laid back. More like sports TV. I like their food."}
{"text":"Here for lunch with a co-worker.  Saw they had a patio and it's a nice day.

Ordered lunch special.  Chipotle penne pasta.  It was decent, not horrible.  Very saucy and a little inconsistent in how some of the pasta was cooked.  Croutons in salad were dry.  Patio has a lot if cheap furniture.  Basically what I expected."}
{"text":"Good middle of the road pizza. Great 2 for 1 Tuesday special. I prefer more sauce than they use but it was pretty good. Best fountain soda I've had anywhere in Vegas"}
{"text":"I am not going back, unless I am desperate or being polite to a group that really wants to go.

I won't waste too many words, since I am not pleased and don't care to relive the experience...

1) bad waitress, really inconsiderate toward my young child
2) food took a long time, no real apology, just a fake excuse (obviously a lie)
3) pizza cheese slightly burnt (not acceptable), but we ate it anyways.
4) expensive for what your really get

Try Pizza Pino instead if you don't mind a hole in the wall that serves delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Buen lugar para tomar UNOs drinks
Pizza nada expectacular pero razonables para el precio.
Buen ambiente."}
{"text":"Every Boston pizza is the same.. Layout and such are pretty identical in each location and as a franchise, the food is all the same.

I've never been a huge fan. Like many, I've gone for UFC fights until they started to charge for admission! The pizza's are ok but not mind blowing in its originality. I actually prefer other pizza franchises that have better sauces. The pasta tends to be overcooked..

The burgers are good though. Order it with cactus fries - those are definitely worth it.

I find the service to be great. I've never had a bad customer experience, which does say something.

Tip your servers well!"}
{"text":"Was great when it first opened, then portions kept getting smaller, prices kept going up, and there were less and less staff, now I avoid this place, the prices are too high for the tiny plates they have.

I should have realized how good it was when it first opened."}
{"text":"I have tried this chain before and wasn't impressed but that was 2 years ago. I thought I'd give it another chance and went to the one by my place.

Decor: It's new but dated in its look. Just does not look put together more of an upscale dive bar.

Food: kids like the pizza but how do you screw up pizza? Pasta with cream sauce tasted grainy and over cooked.  Burger...could have bought it at costco...And a lot of msg.

Service: friendly and attentive. I liked that they had a book of ingredients to check. My kids have peanut allergies so that was comforting. 

Would I go again?  If I took my wife here, she would divorce me so would have to wait for another night when she's out with her gal pals and I'm left with the kids...But Mcdonald's comes to mind except they don't serve beer."}
{"text":"Hit or miss.....cactus chips recently started coming saggy so gotta always ask for well done. No more raspberry vinaigrette..."}
{"text":"I can't even rate this restaurant because the service was abysmal. My friend and I had to wait nearly 10 minutes before a server could take a drink order, another 10 minutes of waiting and a reminder to get our drinks and give our lunch order, and another half hour wait AND another reminder of the status of our lunch order, only to be told that the order was \"lost in the computer, and would it be ok to try again?\" To top it off, the manager refused to come out and apologize for the fiasco, and only after I threatened to make a big scene, did he show up and basically excused himself by saying that a recent flood had affected the computer. Although how this had not effect on 40 other customers until our order is a huge mystery. There was no offer to make up for the fiasco nor any apology. Stay away from this restaurant as the service is absolutely non-existent!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here with friends today. It was pasta Tuesday so our meals were 50% off which is great! I got a Caesar and it was really amazing, had a good punch and lots of flavour. Got the chicken mushroom Fettuccini with goat cheese and it was perfect. The portion was huge and filled me up with some to take home too. Honestly we all liked our food and drinks, and service was great, but I can't say it was an overall 5 star experience. But by no means was it a bad experience, just wasn't anything special.

Great place to come for a nice little dinner after shopping at Pacific mall."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group last Saturday on St Patrick's Day. It was the only place that accepted reservations that day. When I arrived, the place still had a decent number of seats.

They offered to change the colour of the beer to green for St Patty's Day, which was nice. The food was nothing special at all. I could make all of it (and I can't make anything lol). The pizza was average for a place with Pizza in its name and the chicken bites were cold and underwhelming. We later ordered fries and they didn't even give Ketchup.

The atmosphere was pretty dead for a \"drinking holiday\", Leafs game and March Madness games.

The waiter kept constantly coming back to ask us for food and drinks. Not everyone arrived and later we didn't finish our meals/drinks. I know there weren't many customers, but we can call you, you don't need to hound us.

Overall: Nothing special, but a safe choice if you can't get seats elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were here Monday before the leafs game. We had such fond memories of going here before events & games we wanted to go back. They renovated and it looks beautiful inside. Not your average Boston Pizza now. Sadly though, they no longer offer beer schooners. The bar was empty, especially considering the Leafs were about to play and I guarantee this is why. Now they're trying to be like Earl's and the promotions aren't there. Their clientele are sports fans and I feel the missed the mark."}
{"text":"So clutch! The cheese pizza, wings and fries gets me through a hungry evening or night. The chicken philly is pretty good as well. If you live downtown like me they do deliver. Always a good time when I order."}
{"text":"This is the new BP across the Empress Walk Cineplex near Yonge/Sheppard. Service was slow. Food came out slowly too (hangry).

Ordered their $16 Big Dipper burger which is a steak and cheese sandwich, but it sure wasnt very \"big\", nor was the cheese melted properly. Skimpy on the meat too even though I thought BP's meals were ready-made and frozen. Fries tasted fine.

I try to avoid chain restaurants these days, but sometimes its what others prefer. If you must come here, just go for one of their pizzas. They have daily drink specials."}
{"text":"ZERO stars!
Worst pizza ever! augh it's horrible!
So bland, no taste, like eating paper!
And horribly overpriced!
Stay away!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. A few friends and I went and ordered some appetizers and we found a fly in the sauce. Didn't even bother with entrees. It's also quite expensive for some mediocre food. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Menu is huge.  I wasn't very hungry so I tried their Market Salad. Baby spinach tossed with roasted mushrooms, artichoke hearts, bacon, feta, egg... it was pretty yummy.  Service was very good - prompt and friendly.  Pretty decent for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The server we have is great but over an hour for a salad is unacceptable. It isn't even busy. Only a few tables with people. Keeping a small group of hungry people without food is not good business."}
{"text":"I ordered the small pizza it was to greasy I could not eat my pizza I'll never go back to Boston pizza"}
{"text":"This is the worst Boston Pizza ever! They've been open for less than a year and I went closer to their grand opening. You'd think they would try to wow new customers.

But no.

They were soooo stingy with everything. My cheese \"dip\" was not a dip because there was so little cheese that I had to scrape it off the tray with a knife to spread on my bread.
The nachos again barely had any cheese on them. We sent them back with the owner and he returned after probably adding a pinch of cheese. Really?
The pizza was the worst part. Very little toppings, huge crust, and cheese that didn't even cover the sauce. 

This place will probably shut down soon, I hope."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a little while ago with my mother who was visiting from out of town, the service was absolutely horrible. 

Whom I assume to be the manager due to his attire, was the one in which seated us at a comfy booth, he did not say one word on the way to the table (simply doing the two finger peace sign to check that it was just us two dining for the afternoon as we arrived at the front door). 

I have never waited so long to simply have a server come over, as we actually ended up timing it because it became that absurd, it took the server 20-25 MINUTES to even come over to our table to greet us. 

We ordered and the food was out shortly, as my mother ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich (as it is her favourite anywhere we go), there was something quite rancid tasting about the meat, it had an odd smell and colour to the meat, as we were already in a rush from waiting so long for service we wouldn't have had time to choose another menu item/send it back, but that would not have mattered since our server did not come by once to check on how the food was. 

As we waiting for another lengthy period of time (no server was even passing through the dining room this entire time) the sandwich was left there with two single bites taken out of it, with no questions as to how it was and why we didn't eat it, she quickly scurried away to get the check.

Overall it was like a long horrendous nightmare and I am very disappointed in the Boston Pizza brand. Not going to be going to this location again."}
{"text":"Definitely the try the medditarian pizza and cactus cut chips! Superb!
The ambience was nice too and the service was very nice and offered us plenty of time to decide on what we wanted to order .
But the only thing it needs to improve on was the cleanliness of the glasses as one of mugs were dirty but overall amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"not the best pizza but also not the worst one, especially for a thick crust.  

however, their service is disorganized, dysfunctional and uncoordinated.  drinks should arrive before or with the meal, not during.  if a picture and description show ice cream, i expect to see a scoop of it, not just some sad looking big fat cookie.  i take my desserts very seriously!!!"}
{"text":"Food: great
Service: needs improvement (mostly bad)
Price: fair
Interior: poorly maintained
Gluten free: yes!

Review: Despite the bad reviews we went for it anyways. We were looking for a quick bite with the kids and a gluten free menu ( the usual)

We originally planned to sit on the patio, but seeing that the patio was dead for some reason, on a nice night... and the inside wasn't, we didn't want to feel forgotten and decided to sit in. 

The poor hostess looked flushed! She seemed kind and friendly, but over whelmed, with seating guests and cleaning tables, the servers left behind (trashed), The interior was so poorly cared for, although I admit we came in right after the dinner rush, the floors and tables were a disaster. With food, napkins, crayons etc all over the place....

Once seated we were told multiple times ( by our hostess) who came to check up, that our server Daniel would be with us in a few minutes.... 15 minutes later a server named Julia came by to take our order. We asked what ever happened to Daniel... Well... She forgot about us... And although Julia inferred to get her for us, we were not interested! 

Our order was taken very professionally and the server was very helpful. It unfortunately took another 20 minutes until we got our drinks, and shortly after the the kids food (only) showed up... A manager brought it out, who was rude and moody..: all we asked for was some condiments for the kids food, as he rolled his eyes and his whole head when we called him over, 
Shortly after that our food arrived.

**The food was very good, very well priced and well cooked. No complaints.

But this location seemed to be very poorly managed. The staff all looked over worked and drained, most of them taking their sweet time and disappearing for long periods of time. Many tables looked disappointed and frustrated. The only server we saw 'hustling' and run back and forth was our own. Who had been taking care of large parties (large groups) including us.

It seems the management is poorly organized and the place needs someone who is more experienced, and they certainly seemed under staff.

In the future we will consider getting food for take out and not sitting in, unless they train their staff to serve better and come around their table to check up once in a while, and a manager who isn't so rude to the clientele!"}
{"text":"I pretty much like this location of BP, the food is the same as other locations. It has a nice patio at the back that worth to spend summer evenings after work there. I always have pizza in BP and it's always good for me. It would be better if they keep the store cleaner so more customers will be interested."}
{"text":"This was a child hood favorite for a long time. I took family here and felt extremely discriminated against. Customer service is not their strength.
The place was empty and a little after we got there one more family came.
After waiting an hour for our food, I go to grab the order and the cashier asks for my ticket. I couldn't find it and he gave me a hard time. He was the one who took are order! Out of three people in the restaurant at this point it shouldn't have been hard to remember us. The part that upset me is the next order to come out was for another family. The hispanic cashier did not even ask for their ticket and spoke in Spanish to tell them their order was ready. Im Dominican so I look black but speak perfect Spanish. I know what he said and it was just astonishing how nasty the cashier's attitude was to us.

The food is why I am giving this two stars instead of 1. 

I will never eat here again and strongly vote against it."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience here. The place where I work gets pizza from here often and I personally love the chicken wings. The cheesesteak was also very very good. I plan on ordering from them in the future and keeping this local Vegas gem going. Thanks Tony and the Boston Pizza crew!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly.  Orders were taken in a reasonable time.  Our food came out correctly except for the fact the server forgot our appetizer.  The food was standard BP.

The biggest problem was that the restaurant was dirty and a little scary.  Tables around us remained unbussed.  The floors were grimy.  There was some guy who randomly wandered in and out of the party room.  The local hoods were in the booth beside us and freely shared their command of 'colorful' lamguage

It was just generally uncomfortable.  I don't think we will be going back soon."}
{"text":"\"It's pretty good\".

I find it ironic that nothing about Boston Pizza is Boston-inspired. Not even its country of origin. Nonetheless, a great franchise and one of few places where pizza is served in a dining hall/bar

I had the pleasure of trying the new thin crust pizza. Out of the five options, I chose the PIzza-bella. I chose this pizza at random so my review would be unbiased. 

My group of four each ordered a thin crust. It did take long to arrive. I would guess it took 20-25 minutes to get our order. Pizza came and it is a good personal size. 

Here's what I liked:
- Plenty of cheese on the pizza
- ingredients were fresh
- very flavourful toppings and more \"gourmet\" than traditional pizza

Here's what I don't like
- too much oil on the pizza. I'm unsure if its from the cheese, but I have a strong feeling olive oil was added. I could be wrong.
- pizza dough was boring, flat and bland. Imagine flatbread without any flavour. However, small hints of sesame seeds can be tasted throughout, which was very odd

Overall, what could've been a great pizza became a \"OK\" pizza. 

Regards,"}
{"text":"Giant space, tons of TVs (if you're into that sort of thing), and a decent variety of beers on tap, but what really captured my heard was 1) they were open till midnight on a Sunday, when many neighboring businesses close their doors at 10:00, 2) they don't bread their hot wings, and 3) the service is stellar.

While the variety of beers on tap is enough to satisfy some serious discriminating tastes, there aren't a ton of them.  There are, however, some good whiskeys and vodkas behind the bar and of course the food is ridiculously good.  Dillon was a lot of fun to talk to and very efficient and quick to respond to every request I had."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is a tiny dive on Las Vegas Blvd, situated between gentleman's clubs and wedding chapels. The best thing going for them is they are open late and prices reflect the local diner feel. If you eat inside the restaurant they serve beer which makes it feel like a neighborhood bar. Also, the ranch dressing is the best I've had. Great spot when it's late and your hungry. Food is nothing glamorous but that's not the draw here. Local, inexpensive, accessible, delivery, beer... What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Boston's pizza is amazing. The location isn't ideal, considering it's right next to a gentleman's club just at the end of the strip. The food never disappoints. Whether you are sober or drunk this place will always be delicious. 

They make their own ranch which is to die for. I could just drink it like water, just kidding. But really, everything is good there. I always get the wings and philly cheese steak. 

Only bad thing--- they give you 1 refill on your drink then after that you have to pay for refill. Also, the wait is extremely long when there's a few people ahead of you but that's fine because it's all worth it."}
{"text":"If there was a negative to this review, this place would have it. This review is for the customer service experience.

First of all, the business is in LAS VEGAS so don't be surprise if someone gives you an out of state phone number. Second of all, what does that mean \"i don't know where that is\" when i give you an address. How about a GPS?? Third, I called to make a delivery order and instead of telling us they don't deliver to the area i was renting at, the worker rudely laughed and hung up. TWICE.

Now, i don't care how good your food is and how many good reviews you got but you should have some respect for your customer if you're a true business owner. Enough said!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the WORST restaurants I've been to for a very long time and this is not an exaggeration believe me. I came here with my boyfriend and we were seated at the lounge. Our waiter was a Chinese man named LARRY that was SUPER RUDE and impatient. He was rushing us to order and when we were finally ready to order and called him over he's like \"are you finally ready?\" I was shocked to be served with such disrespectful attitude.  We ordered a small pizza (Boston royal) and a rack of ribs that includes two sides. When the food arrived I was utterly so disappointed with the display of the food. The ribs looked like the size of my palm and I'm a TINY girl. I was thinking wtf seriously and the pizza looked like something I could get from pizza pizza and it looks disgusting. The fries were like dollar store frozen package of skinny thin fries n the only thing that was good was probably the Cesar salad. There was absolutely no service provided, the Chinese man did not bother to make sure everything was ok and I couldn't wait to finish and get the hell out of there. I had much higher expectation for Boston pizza but it felt like I was in a fast food Chinese restaurant with shit food. I'm so tired of coming across articles were servers complain about their customers not tipping enough but never REFLECT upon their own actions. Just a tip for servers here, before you complain about the customer being cheap for not tipping enough maybe consider taking it as a LESSON and do your job properly next time around !"}
{"text":"so we came in as a big group.  food was decent.  server was kind.  we were on our lunchbreak.  ideally wed like to be in and out things were a tad slow in terms of service collecting payment ...
but there were only two.servers in the place.
 would have been nice to have two for efficiemcy sake.  otherwise decent 3/5 ,not great not terrrible"}
{"text":"My husband used to rave about Boston pizza so we finally made it over there I was very much underwhelmed and felt that the prices were way too incredibly high the service was lacking and it was extremely busy during lunchtime. It took us about an hour to get our food which is extremely unacceptable and the food was very much so so. I was so disappointed that we paid upwards of almost $50 for a meal for two people during lunchtime. This only reaffirms my belief of never wanting to go back to another Boston pizza."}
{"text":"Decent service, good food, lots of young kids... 

That would pretty much sum up my recent visit to this Boston Pizza location. 

My friend and I ordered a glass of wine each and fish tacos. They were very tasty. However, the side of fries that we had to pay extra for was very small and not even good for one person to eat. I was quite disappointed. 

I like to come here for drinks with my friends and don't often order the food. The service is always good. Can't complain!"}
{"text":"I've been a local to this spot for several years now and I've also recently started making reviews. I actually ordered this for delivery and it usually takes 30-45 minutes. The location is a little bit meh, but the food and taste will definitely hit the spot. The price is fair for the portions they serve. The wait is a little long, but your mouth will water once your number is called."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! Had a craving for their pizza late night/early morning. Saddened to discover that although their signs say \"open\" they were in fact closed at 3:25 a.m. 

Not actually open until 4 a.m."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The menu changes from time to time for certain items. The butter chicken pasta, when they have it, is one of my favorite pastas there. It is cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The warm spinach and cheese dip with boston pizza dough is one of my favorite entrees along with the fried pizza spring rolls with marinara side dip. You have to try the pizza burger, it is so so Good !!! but very filling. The food has never disappointed me and I love trying the new items on the menu however, I never order the pizza there. They have a lot of variety enough to please everyone, some fun frozen drinks too. The ambiance is nice warm and cozy and the service is always very polite and friendly. If you've never been to Boston Pizza I would really recommend you trying it out at least once, I'm pretty sure it won't be your last visit."}
{"text":"Surprised at the bad reviews, I've never experienced bad food or bad service there. Some of my 1 star reviews however really describe what bad to me really is. I've always had great food and friendly service at Boston pizza. The only pizza I liked was the Mediterranean one, the rest I agree, take out is better. Try the pizza burger or pizza poutine or even the fried pizza spring rolls instead. Burgers are great so are the many sandwiches. Last thing I tried was breaded buffalo chicken sandwich with Cesar salad which I enjoyed, the bread tasted like local bakery bread and not store bought, big plus ! My friend had sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo, delicious !
I've never ordered from there but the food and service at the restaurant was always great in my opinion and the ones of my friends/ family. I've been to BP about 5x already and I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok. Not the best I've had but worth a try since my husband stated this chain was very popular in Canada. Service was fast.  This chain reminded me of Uno's.  If you want a variety, I would deff check this place out, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"So if I wrote this review a few years ago, it would have been 5 stars and I would have tried to give it 6! HOWEVER, what the hell happened Boston?? The quality has gone downhill. We have noticed a huge difference over the last 2 years give or take. Did you change cooks? You need to bring back the old one!! Boston Pizza had the best crust that had me drool just thinking about it.....but now....not so much. It is dry and boring. We loved the Tuesday special of buy one, get one free!! Great deal!! If you make your pizza as you were a few years ago I promise to come back and re-do my review!"}
{"text":"Just came back from Boston Pizza and this was the Rutherford location. We like this location because it's close. I have been here a few times and all I can say is that they have upped their standards by a lot! The manager came out greeted us kept on walking by making sure everyone was fine. The waiter was very nice, she also checked on us many times. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. What more can I say, they really deserve the 5 stars today! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Straight up pizza joint.  \"The old man\" from Pawn Stars has advertised their wings on the show many times.  I can't attest for the wings but I can tell ya that the spinach pizza w/feta cheese is a good tangy cheesy and standard fare choice.  My fellow diners had the meaty one and they seemed to approve as well.  Get them while they're hot.  As we pulled in a local vagrant was giving me the stink-eye all the way through to the parking lot.  I give charity to these citizens by not making it a brawling scuffle, because well..  Other than that the pies are good & greasy.  Some people don't like that.  I do."}
{"text":"Horrible nachos, the chips were so old they felt like cardboard when I chewed on them.  Pasta was pretty basic too. The food is nothing like the pictures in their menu ( is it ever ? Lol ). Even though the older Boston pizza at Sheppard center was notorious for their rude staff, the staff here were fairly polite. However please don't eat here, or eat at your own risk. The draught heinken was okay too."}
{"text":"Called for a delivery of a pizza one side easy cheese and the other side is easy sauce. The pizza was not what we ordered. The wings tasted like they have been under a heat for way to long. As if you were eating styrofoam. Yuck! 

Giving 2 stars just because they delivered. But gosh, why over an hour with horrible not fresh pizza and wings. Delivery includes only one pepper and one parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a party of 25 (15 adults and 10 children) 5 days prior to my event! On the day of the event, the staff had no idea of what was going on. Our party arrived in bits and pieces, as in not all 25 of us entered the restaurant at the same time! The waitresses came up to me and said \"the kitchen wants to know if/when you will be ordering your entrees\" as we were eating our appetizers!! HOW RUDE!! On top of this, a waitress spilled ginger ale on two of my guests, I do not understand how one could knock over such a tall glass... it was so embarassing. They did not offer us the desserts that come with the kids meal, instead they brought us the bill! NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION. I regret going there."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 8 friends and we made 4 separate orders. i ordered first and was a simple order of Hot wings and fries. I waited patiently as all my friends and people after them got their food. I walked back to the counter and ask them about it. they looked confused and looked around for the order ticket and then came up and apologized for forgetting. At this point they asked if I wanted the food, all my friends had gotten their food already and were half way done. If they had used common sense they would have just offered the refund or something else as is normal in the food industry. I opted for a refund as by the time it was done my friends would be ready to leave. I do have concerns with the manager that had to issue the refund as he did not know how to use the point of sale and truly doubt that the refund went through. If it did not, i will be charging the transaction back and hope that the the merchant services for this merchant charges them expensive fees."}
{"text":"Visited the new Boston Pizza location this evening.  Great experience.  Friendly server, good food and reasonable prices.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I normally hate BP's; it's a franchise - enough said; too many franchises in this city. Franchises typically have a lack of creativity and passion, and offer little support for the local community. 

That being said as far as Boston Pizza's go this is the BEST in south Calgary. Consistently good food, drink specials, and a really good management and staff. 
They will also modify most stuff on the menu for you if you ask nicely."}
{"text":"One of the worst BP's in Calgary. No specials, food is not cooked very well, and they refuse to do any modifications. My wife ordered a Gluten free pizza and she asked for a different sauce and was warned it was not gluten free, fine okay I get that. They refused to switch the sauce siting it is against policy and they could be sued if Roz had an issue with the gluten. It was bizarre; my wife orders the same thing every time and only this BP's had a problem."}
{"text":"Came here the other night to watch Game 2 of the NHL Playoffs.

Compared to other locations, it's pretty small; however, there is still enough seating. One of the perks is that it's right on the subway line. From Eglinton Station I left at 7:30 and managed to arrive to the front entrance of BP by 7:50 without going outside.

There are two sections: the bar area and the dining area. I didn't spend much time in the latter so I can only comment on their bar. There was also, I think, a patio. I could be wrong so don't quote me on that though. With 4 big screens, this establishment is a good place to go if you want to watch sports events. We were around high schoolers on a date or middle aged men watching the hockey game. It was an interesting mix to say the least!

The food was meh ... the garden salad was pretty gross as the lettuce used was obvi old. The nachos and yam fries were your typical pub classics. The service was okay. I think our servers could have come to our table a little more often.

A solid 3 star.
When I'm senile and sitting on my rocking chair, I won't think of that June 4th night that I went to BP, but I also won't be having eternal nightmares thinking of my experience here."}
{"text":"Compared to other locations, Chicken Jambalaya pasta is always good here!!!
Service is okay. 
Chicken wings are always good, too!"}
{"text":"Having worked in the restaurant industry (including 1-year at the Saskatoon Boston Pizza) while putting myself through university, it remains an industry near and dear to my heart.

Being a busy single dad of young twin boys, I frequent the Creekside (Calgary, Ab) location at least once per week (in my guesstimation, spending $3,000+ per year at that location alone). Honestly speaking, I have watched the prices creep up to that of finer establishments over the years (think Earl's, Joey's, Cactus Club); yet the food remains rather generic & the service below average...but it is kid friendly.

This past Friday I ordered take-out. Given that I reside less than 2 KM from the restaurant, I was unimpressed to hear of the $6 delivery charge.

I called the restaurant the next eve (Saturday March 21, 2015) and was connected to 'Barett,' the night manager. Barrett instructed me that the delivery driver's sole compensation consisted of $6.85 per delivery ($.85 via the restaurant and $6 via the customer). As noted, having worked in the restaurant for years and being a successful business man for the 20 years since, I can tell you that relying on the consumer to pay 88% of an employee's/contractor's wage (not including the tip that the delivery driver expects when they arrive at your door) is absolutely ridiculous.

My request to young Barett was simple...please provide the name and number of ownership, thus enabling me the opportunity to express my opinion. Young Barett guaranteed me that he would email me said information prior to night's end. Young Barett failed to live up to his word.

Following up w the Creekside Boston Pizza on the evening of Sunday March 22, 2015, I once again had the pleasure of speaking w young Barett. According to Barett, he forgot to email me the requested information. I once again provided my email address and asked that ownership information be emailed to me. At this point young Barett instructed me that...

A) I was no longer welcome at the restaurant.
B) He would not provide me with the contact information of his superiors.
C) I was extremely rude. It would appear that according to young Barett, voicing an opinion as a valued consumer makes one rude.

A disgrace to the industry; one that I will be following up with to the very top of the chain if necessary.

Disgusted in Calgary,

{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza last night to go. When I came in to pick it up, I was using my debit card to pay for it. The girl asked for ID, which was no problem since signs are clearly posted about this. My particular debit card does not have a name printed on it. Because of this fact, I was informed that she would have to write down ALL of my info from my license...and then she asked \"is that ok?\" Well NO, it isn't OK, but what was I to do at that point? I said I understood wanting to write my name down since that is the same info that you would have gotten had my name been printed on the card.  She responded with a VERY RUDE \"Well you don't HAVE TO use it.\" as her answer. Of course I did have to use it, since that was the form of payment I came prepared with. Both myself and my daughter who was standing right there next to me were in shock over how rude this cashier was, for no apparent reason.
I recently moved close by, and was looking forward to getting to have Boston pizza on a regular basis now, but after that encounter I don't see that happening. 
The need to write down ALL of my DL information is ridiculous....Have you heard of identity theft? And the rudeness and complete \"i don't give a shi*t\" attitude displayed by your cashier makes me want to do business elsewhere. Sad, but true.

If your website \"contact us\" section actually worked, you would have got to read this privately instead of on YELP."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my buddies to watch the UFC fight.

Pros:
1) Lots of TVs

Cons:
1) Got here at 7:30pm.  The owner was anal about my group of 5 spending $$$ before the fight (9pm), and then spending at least another $15 after the fight began.  Understandable, as it's a big fight and he's a business owner.  He was just a bit anal about it.  He also told me to make sure everyone was 19+ and he'd be checking IDs.  Like no shit, Sherlock.  What kinds of dumb underaged kids go to Boston Pizza to drink anyways?

2) Food was mediocre at best.  I got a Hawaiian Pizza.  It was the most mediocre pizza I've ever eaten.

3) Waitress was unattentive.  She forgot to give us utensils for our meals and we had to flag her down a few times to take our orders.


Would've definitely went to the 3 Brewers instead, but they weren't showing the fight.  Save your taste buds and wallet and go to the 3 Brewers instead."}
{"text":"Ok I'm in Montreal for a business trip with a co-worker and starving. We find a strip full of restuarants and it 7:00 pm. What the heck to do.

Boston Pizza in Montreal, what a oxymoron. The parking lot was crowded for a Tuesday night so it can't be all that bad.

I order a Black Angus certified 10 oz Sirloin with garlic toast, veggies and salad. 19.99 canadian. I order it medium rare thinking that it could be tough. It was allright but I needed a A1 sauce or something, what I received was this meatloaf sauce (the kind your mom made.....yucky). Veggies were soggy.

I think next time I will try the pizza. For lunch that is. Off to downtown for dinner..."}
{"text":"While I do enjoy the food at Boston Pizza, the Aurora location frustrates me to no end. The frequently changing managers provide a frequently changing experience. 

Boston Pizza is typically a kid friendly place. I have been to this location with my children a couple dozen times. Things are great for a while, then there are problems with seating policies, service speed, food consistency. 

We will take breaks for weeks or months at a time, then give into the kids and return, often to find things have not changed. 

I have spoken to head office and have received lip service. 

I guess they aren't hurting for business. I might be a little too picky but with many other local businesses to choose from that genuinely respect the customer, it's hard for me to return again to give it yet another try."}
{"text":"The food is food here. Better than uxbridge it actually has taste. But the service isn't very good. We never got refills and she took 20 mins to give us our food each person. My sons food was cold when he got his and the fries where old tasting"}
{"text":"We come here often. Always sit bar side. Just two of us. No problem. 

This time was different. I bought my son and 2 grand kids. First. No offer of a booster seat. Went and got my own. 
Second. Was told by waitress that she would not return until we all closed our menu so she didn't have to waste time returning if we didn't know what we wanted. What if we had a question?  
Third. She didn't write our order down ( because she's so smart). Then other staff had to return and ask what we ordered. 

A person ( not our server) bought my son and my food first. We order sandwiches. His fries were hot, mine stone cold.   Then we waited and waited. Next they bought over my hubby's wing. Still no sign of very small children's spaghetti.  When they finally did get their food there was no apology so I assume they think this was fine.  Must point out that other tables were getting food while we waited. 

I went and found the parmigiana cheese myself at the waiter station. 

After we finished eating I realized we were not given any wet naps which I would think at the very least the guy that ordered wings deserved. I had to go in the kitchen and ask for some. 

All in all it was crap service. It was 4 o'clock and not busy.  But at least I didn't waste our servers time with petty requests. 

I do wish they would hire people who actually eat in restaurants and not just pick up at drive thru so they have some inkling of what service means!  Yes, you do need to let me waste your time. I pay for that privilege."}
{"text":"Great bar always a good time. Never have I had a problem with the food. The bartenders are always friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't gotten pizza but got cheesesteak. 
Cheesesteak quality is very similar to philly! That's definitely a loaded topic haha for philly people, but this spot definitely has kept the quality up there in Vegas. Ordered over the phone around 1am, picked up after 15 min. It's close to $10 for a cheesesteak with everything. Hot and fresh. Parking lot is available. Kinda sketchy area after dark."}
{"text":"I come to this Boston Pizza location often. Food is good, staff is average, nothing special. Staff could be a bit more welcoming and inviting. Restaurant could use a bit of a renovation - the booths have some old fashion patterns on it and the carpet as well. 

I always get the cheese ravioli I and it's always great! Last time I asked for the tomato sauce but got the meat sauce instead and as I am vegetarian I had to ask the waitress to take it back. She was very apologetic and my food arrived in a timely manner. Bill always arrives promptly.

Will recommend and continue dinning at this location."}
{"text":"Nice location. Considering the NBA playoffs were on AND it was a Friday night, it was very dead which I really didn't mind. We were seated right away and our food came pretty fast as well. 

I ordered the jambalaya which was delicious with just the right amount of spice. My date got his normal, the chicken pesto which was good but overly drenched in pesto sauce. 

My complaint is that the mojito I ordered was literally the most disgusting mojito I've ever had. There was absolutely no mint in it and it was just very sour (like a lemonade with lots of lemon and little sugar). I told the waiter and he gladly took the drink back and made me a delicious white wine sangria instead with an extra ounce of wine.

It also took us about 20 mins to flag someone down to pay for our bill. 

Overall this was a nice location and I'd give it a 3.5 rating if Yelp allowed half stars. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"This establishment used to be a nice place to be around. It was organized, clean and the people working were polite but now the restaurant has gone completely downhill. I wonder if it's a change in management, the place isn't like what it used to be. Even the quality of food is poor now. You guys need to sort out your issues fast because this place is heading to the dumpster. 
I was there yesterday and your managers there are quite rude when I mentioned to him that the pizza wasn't made properly. 
Do not eat here, you've been warned."}
{"text":"the food is so gross. i ordered the salmon as a main dish. it was luke warm and the veggies looked and tasted as if it came out of the freezer. it was bland and watery. the service is good and the only good thing about this place are the drinks. the appetizers are good but even the pizza here is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I've been here before for drinls and had a good experience. I visited here two weeks ago for dinner as the keg down the street was crazy busy, as always. I ordered the salmon and it was great. Very filling. My friend ordered the seafood Alfredo and she enjoyed it. The service was good and the prices were reasonable. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Apparently you either get really good service, or really bad service. I suppose we were lucky. 

My sister and I went on a Toronto adventure for 2 reasons: So that she could legally drink before turning 21, and so she could go to a One Direction concert.
I was just along for the ride, haha.

This is a great place to sit outside and people watch, while sipping on (good) cheap beer and having a nice meal. The lunch menu was great. They have a build your own pasta dish section for under $11 too.

I got teased by a guy one table over for going to Boston Pizza instead of an authentic Canadian place, but heck, at least it was good! Try it."}
{"text":"Good afternoon everybody highly recommend to go to this place if you love some good pizza and they have the most amazing BLT sandwiches. They r fast with Service and really polite. Boston pizza you're amazing"}
{"text":"Solid Boston Pizza spot to watch a UFC fight.  Go there early and stake out a table otherwise see if some friendly pair of people willing to split a table with you.  We were lucky and these two guys let us join their table right before the PPV started.

Hats off to these gentlemen for being so kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that have consistently fed the local community and tourists with their down-to-earth pizzas and other items on the menu for decades, this is definitely the spot! We were introduced to Boston Pizza by a local friend and it turns out to be a LV local gem! We ordered large Meatlovers and they were simply wonderful: generous size, generous toppings, easy salt, thick pizza but easy on the dough, perfectly balanced sauce and cheese and other toppings to ensure beautiful texture and taste. One caution for the pretentious few: this place is very fast-paced because they are all busy making or delivering fresh, hot pizzas and other items around Las Vegas, so if you need crushed pepper and cheese packets or extra napkins, simply speak up and they will take care of you in no time. Will definitely go back there again this coming week!"}
{"text":"I've always came to Boston Pizza mid afternoons because I know how busy they are at lunch and dinner time. My friends and I prefer sitting in the bar area side than the restaurant since there are no kids with us. Every time I have came, the waiter has been so nice and professional.

Food is descent. To be honest, the menu is a bit overwhelming since its so big but i stick to my usuals :)

Clean environment with slot machines in the back and you can always catch different sport games playing in the tv's. Overall nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Boston pizza has always been consistent with service and food quality. This location is no different from the others. Service is good, food is always good and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza has a bad rap where I work, as greasy fast sit-down food. I'll be the first to admit it's not overly healthy and probably shouldn't be consumed on a regular basis, but sometimes one just feels like a little grease to help the bowels.. (haha I'm half kidding). 

The good thing about Boston pizza is that they are fast.  I've gone here in large groups and they do the pre-ordering thing, so the food is basically ready when you sit down. It's pretty efficient.  They have specials everyday which are a good deal. I think the specials are $6.99 or something, and you get a good size meal off stuff on their regular menu.  

Whenever I've come, I've gotten their pasta. It's really simple, but good and not at all greasy (at least not from what I can see, and that's all that matters)."}
{"text":"...they delivered directly to our hotel 3 times. Quick delivery. Pizza had TONS of cheese."}
{"text":"I came here the other day for dinner and it was very nicely decorated. It was dim and just a very nice and comfy family restaurant. We sat down and ordered my usual the Mediterranean pizza and waited. The food came pretty quickly. The pizza was reasonably priced and it was pretty good. The pizza has a bunch of tasty toppings and they are very generous with the amount of toppings they put on. The drizzle of pesto is so good it gives the pizza a sweet taste. The crust is really good too, usually I don't like the crust of pizza to much but here it is so crunchy and tasty. The crust was so tasty I was starting to believe they used a wood oven to cook it. The pizza isn't that thick but I got really full after 3 slices. Everyone else loved the pizza and thought it was the best pizza in the GTA. Overall great service and even better food."}
{"text":"I love their food!  Their pizza is yum, their calzones are yum, their fingers & wings...mmm.  You wouldn't guess from the outside that they'd actually have decent food.  Their remodel did make it look a lot better on the inside though.  My office orders lunch from here often and it's a little pricey for pizza and wings but well worth it!"}
{"text":"it's mediocre food and they only had like one waitress working when it was pretty crowded. atmosphere is nice though"}
{"text":"I love their gyros! It was one of the best. $6.99 special and you'll get fries & a drink. It was delicious."}
{"text":"There are hits and misses to this location, some nights we would find that the service was great and other nights the service to be just \"meh\".

We don't have very high expectations when coming here, hopefully when you go it's good service."}
{"text":"I have family at the hospital down the street so we decided to check this place out. The food was so good! It have a parking lot so you don't have to park in a garage and walk or anything. The only reason I took away one star is because there isn't a ton of seating. But I would definitely recommend it for their delicious food"}
{"text":"This place is my go to place for food while I am on a business trip in toronto. The oven roasted wings are phenomenal. Get a case of wings and you are set for the night ;)
I tried the pizza, jambalaya, wings, burgers, ribs. The -1 star is for the inconsistent of food quality. Maybe just me eating here too many times"}
{"text":"I always wonder how boston pizza hasn't gone bankrupt, as every location I ever go to there's something wrong with either the food, or service. At this location, I found a big ass hair in my food. When I got the manager, he suggested buying me a dessert but I still had to pay for my pizzas which I took three bites of."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pizza Burger.   We came from out of town and I remember seeing it advertised.    Well...   I only ate half.   The first couple of bites were really tasty.  Then it hit.   This burger was soooo greasy and heavy in my stomach it started to hit me like a bomb.   Not to mention the grease puddle left on the plate.

We also tried a pizza.    Not too bad, nothing great.    Typical of a chain pizza place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Quick service. Iconic spicy perogy pizza and spicy perogy burger. The whole concept of both is quite ridiculous (a burger with cactus cut potato slices inside? pizza with sour cream) and obviously heavy in calories but tastes great. Free refills on pop. Open late. Would recommend. Pizza is expensive. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Was robbed 20$ from this place. Went here during a Habs game in the afternoon and thought there wings special was still 5$ for 8 wings but no it only works at night games. I was NEVER told by any staff that the wings special does not apply for afternoon games. They definitely have lost a loyal customer in me. As I would often go to the hockey wings special and would return on other occasions sporting events. As I always stayed loyal because of my satisfaction with there promoting."}
{"text":"I have been craving the cactus cut fries for a few weeks since seeing ads for it. We got the Cheesesteak cactus fries which were good but got boring real fast.. next time I will stick with the nachos.
 For meals my Wife and I ordered the steak and veggies which if you are counting calories or watching your waistline this is the ideal choice. I was a bit put off that the steak came with the fat still on but ya can't have everything. The veggies were good, steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and other yummy veggies as well as a tasty salad with incredible dressing.. the above meal I believe was posted at 440 calories and 44 grams of protein 330g of sodium which was a real nice surprise. Our Daughter got the chicken Caesar salad which she thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Food is sub-par as you can expect from any chain, but it's newly furnished and the seating isn't too bad, seats near the wall is kinda odd as you'll be craning your neck up to watch the TV's the whole time. 

The french onion soup was surprisingly decent."}
{"text":"Super late night grub! Can't go wrong with Boston pizza! It's cheesy and full of flavor! We also ordered a 40 PC chicken wings w/ranch. Now that ranch is no joke! It's nice and thick but creamy tasty. Wings weren't that great. It seems that the later time you come they side foods are old and dry. Except (pizza) Don't know if anyone can relate? Last time my chicken wings were old like if they have been sitting under a heat lamp or something. I'm giving it 4 starts because of the disappointing wings"}
{"text":"It was not only about their poor food, it is about their poor service. 
First, my group sat on the bar area since we only wanted to grab light snacks with glass of beers only. Just right after we sat on bar area, we thought it was way too noisy for the sport games and asked waitress that we need to move into dining room. We even didn't order yet, and waitress didn't serve anything yet to us. But it seems like she doesn't like what we asked her. I understand she could be disappointed but that attitude made us so uncomfortable. Once we order our snacks(one Pizza) and beer at the dining area, one of my friend asked for the cup of water. Waitress didn't come back for more than 15 min even the dining area was pretty empty. We tried find servers in the dining hall, but it seems like no one is paying attention to customers at tables. I found them near kitchen hall, chatting to each other. All 4 servers were chatting at that place, laughing each other and seems like having a really fun chatting. My table thought we can't expect any service this place. So once we empty our beer glass, we just left. This is really handy spot if you leave near north york station, but I don't want to go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awful! My food was wrong, the server was not found very often but my beer and water were empty a lot, the price on my bill was wrong, and the on duty manager said she could not fix it after I over paid. Ridiculous! She gave me a number to call and when I did there was no answer, so if you want mediocre food, bad service, and want to be robbed, then I suggest you hurry to BP;s."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for family fun and the Jays game. Not too packed but not totally dead either! Service is decent ...just wish they checked in more often. Starting line up platter is NOT the greatest!"}
{"text":"We visited this Boston Pizza last Friday at 2pm for a late lunch. The waitress was nice and attentive. 

We took advantage of the $10 lunch time specials. I ordered the 3 topping personal pizza with fries. My sister got the Quesadilla with fries. 

We enjoyed the food and would get their pizza and fries combo again!"}
{"text":"Went back since I gave it 4 stars to check on standards. Total fail.
Semi frozen product, lame service. Won't come back this time. Very poor."}
{"text":"we were just here couple of minutes ago, ordered artichoke dip, wings and steak. everything is edible and taste good except for the steak, i told the server that the steak is chewy and she said it suppose to be ok especially its medium rare, and she said that she cant do anything about it.. the steak os chewy, to the point that its not edible! the server is very nice but in situation like that she doesn't know how to handle it!"}
{"text":"Best thick crust gluten-free pizza I've had."}
{"text":"Kept on hold for 10 minutes and never placed my order. But first asked if I was placing for delivery or pick-up. If I would've said delivery maybe I wouldn't have been placed on never ending hold."}
{"text":"If you're ever looking to bulk or want carb overload- check out BP!
I guess that's the reason I'm not a huge fan, but also I feel the prices are too expensive for what you get. 
The salads are not as delicious as they make sound, and the pizza is mediocre at best. The best food would be the taco pasta, omg it's drool-worthy. Soooo delicious. Heart-eyes ALL DAY. 
I'm not too sure about their drinks because I haven't tried many of them, but the spicy sriracha caesar is enough to blow your mouth into space- it's really good but holy crap.. is half the sriracha bottle in there?

The workers here are very nice though, especially the manager. I had a free discount on a starter and even though they couldn't access it properly, they gave it to me for free anyway. Customer service is pretty great!

Overall, I'm not a fan of BP. It's more of a last resort nowhere else to go place for me, but those are personal reasons. It's a good quality food place regardless."}
{"text":"Very very disappointing. They refused to take us in because we were 8 people and there was mo room for and they said no point in waiting as they will not accept 8.
First time i am seeing a resturant not serving 8 guests."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza place I have ever been too, and I live for pizza! I've never had to bring a pizza back... They told me a small would serve 8 slices and it was nothing near. The once I went to grab a slice all the ingredients would fall off and I was left with a slice of dough. They also served me hot pizza on a plastic plate.... tried to complain to the staff and was told that this was the norm, and everyone eats it this way.....? The only nice thing was, I was rewarded my refund. & only ate the salad bc I had not ate in two days."}
{"text":"I generally associate Boston Pizza with mediocrity and this one is no different. Compared to the couple of other locations, this one is smaller. The patio is pretty bad given that it rests right over the TTC subway grates of Sheppard Station.

The best part is the bar area with the large screens and plenty of servers there to provide you with adult beverages.

The food is a bit on the expensive side for what you get. I ordered the poutine once for $7 and I literally got 25 frozen to fried french fries, 2 tablespoons of gravy and 5 cheese curds. Looking at the price for pizza, I find it hard to justify a price of $35... even if it is Boston-style.

In summary, I come for the atmosphere of the bar area, to be with friends and to enjoy the game but before that, I will visit one of the fast food restaurants around the area for food."}
{"text":"Last night, some friends and I spent about 4 hours at the Richmond Road Boston Pizza having dinner, drinks, and shooting some pool. In fact, my friend who volunteered to pay for the evening racked up a bill of over $430. With that kind of tab, you'd think we would have recieved better service.

Firstly, it took more than 15 minutes after we came in and sat down before we were even met by our first employee, to get menus and drinks (at which point our table still hadn't been wiped down from the last people sitting at it, which is surprising given that it wasn't that busy - it was a Tuesday night, after all.) Once they gave us the menus and took the drink orders it was another 20 minutes or so before the drinks came (and there were only 4 of us at this point, so it's not like it was a tall order) and it was at THIS POINT that one of the people I was sitting with had to ask for the table to be wiped. Not the best first impression.

Once we got the food, everything was pretty much as expected. Really, if you've eaten in one Boston Pizza, you know what to expect... but, after everyone had finished eating and was waiting to get the rest boxed up to take with us, we were stuck waiting again... for over an hour. The rest of the night, we didn't even get any real service - anybody who wanted a drink had to go to the bar to get it (which, when at points we were one of only two groups in the entire lounge area, isn't a great sign.)

All in all, I was pretty unimpressed, and the two servers we DID deal with seemed rather surly and disinterested (one was downright rude). You'd think with a single group making up probably half your business at the time, a little smile or occasionally checking in to see if they need anything would be the least you could do.

So, yeah... I gave it two stars because the food was decent (though, as I said, pretty much the franchise standard) but the only thing that really made this different from any other location in the chain was the service, which was pretty terrible."}
{"text":"What place can you go to on your last day in town when you need to check out of your hotel, your flight is not for quite a few hours and your appetite is ready to burn some time? They must be used to this because they immediately offered to hold out suitcase in the holding area while we dined. 

Thanks Boston Pizza! 

1st off I must start off by saying I was very nervous about this Boston pizza place, because let's be honest here, Boston is known for a lot of things and pizza isn't one of them. Luckily this restaurant has a bit of something for everyone (and it doesn't seem like pizza is the most popular item). 

We ordered quesadillas and wings and sangrias (Boston size that) and enjoyed a few hours of the afternoon. Food was actually pretty decent in a chain restaurant, standard food kinda way. All good!"}
{"text":"I used to love Boston pizza. I would go at least once a month and always get the thia chicken bites. However now I find the prices have gone up and portion size and quality has gone down. How can you charge $12.00 for 2 chicken strips cut up and call it thia chicken bites. Not to mention every time my bf and I have gone recently we see the waitress  2 times for our drink order and food order and  then never again. It was so bad at our last visit we had to call over anyone that worked there just to get the bill which still took 15 mins to get to our table. I will never go to Boston pizza again. Horrible food horrible service, definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"4:25 pm, I have the bar all to myself! No one is here. I needed some food & beer to hold me until dinner so here I am. Hello Jenny the bartender, thank you for your undivided personal attention while I was here! (you didn't really have a choice did you?) sippin on a Creemore Springs beer, enjoying my garden salad. I ate the Great White pizza, it was very tasty and would get it again."}
{"text":"Open until 2am, thats good to know, but i'm not planning on staying that late this evening. 
Decided to sit in the Sports Bar side as I do enjoy watching sports highlights. Upon entering, we were welcomed by the soothing sounds of reggae music, not my first choice for dinner music, but it did grow on my over the course of the night. There was only one server on at the time, who was also the bartender. Despite having 4 patrons at his bar, and 3 other tables, he was over quickly to take our drink order and brought them out pretty quickly. Ordered the Perogy Pizza and it was delicious as always. Bartender checked in with us a few times to refill drinks and check for satisfaction. 
Decent food, great service. I would definetly recommend this place if you're just not up for cooking."}
{"text":"Same pricy pizza joint. Come here on Saturday night and it was not even half full. You know what it means. 

For a individual pizza cost you $15. Is it worth it? No. 

Better off just come here for beer."}
{"text":"Bad food. I ordered bowtie chicken pesto pasta... Dish mentioned it has sun-dried tomatoes, but dish came with raw tomatoes. 
Sauce was bad, overall experience not that great. 
I had better experience at other locations."}
{"text":"Located in the T&T Plaza, this is quite the popular Boston Pizza and I have been a frequent patron of this Boston Pizza for many years watching a variety of sports such as UFC, Raptors, Blue Jays and Leafs. During playoffs for Toronto sports, the vibe in the restaurant/bar is incredible. It's fully packed with enthusiastic sports fan cheering and yelling. Loved their beer specials here as they have a drink special each day of the week. My favorite dishes here are usually the pasta and pizza dishes. They have some unique pizza combinations and the pasta is usually a pretty safe bet to get. I tried the jambalaya fettuccini.  It was pretty good and nicely seasoned. There was a bit of a kick in the pasta dish but not too spicy. They gave a good amount of shrimp and sausage in the pasta dish. Nachos are great for game days as it's a nice shareable dish with a few friends with some delicious guacamole on the side. Overall, one of my favorite Boston Pizza's to come to have socialized with friends or to catch some sports!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends to watch the Raptors and Leafs game. It was fairly busy because there were so many sporting events going on a Saturday night. I like this Boston Pizza- good size, very clean and the staff are great. They have daily food and drinks specials which is nice. That particular night, they had pints of Molson on a special. I ordered the pasta dish with shrimp and it was alright. I think the dish was way too overpowering with cheese but it was quite strong. I don't usually like my pasta loaded with that much cheese. The pasta was alright though. Overall, definitely of the better Boston Pizza locations I've been to. Loved the atmosphere of being able to cheer on your favourite sport teams and get a good vibe doing so."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The wait time is horrendously long. We waited for 50 mins just to get our food which wasn't the same thing we ordered. 
Also, when me and my sister entered the restaurant, there was no body at the front desk. The restaurant is heavily understaffed. 
Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I have to say im very disappointed in this place, the cleanliness,  the staff,  the service,  and the food after yesterday's experience.  
Came here for a to go order.  10, 15, 20 mins go by not a word from anyone.  Mind you im sitting directly ahead of the counter.  I then notice 30 mins into sitting one guy returned his order for some odd reason. Two minutes later some people order and I am just about certain they received the prior guys order.  They received their order in less than 3 mins. CRAZY RIGHT!  The angry man gets up and request a refund i then spot a box on top of the oven with my number on it in the midst of the chaos and decide 30 mins was about the amount of time id take to slaughter, pluck,  batter and fry my own chicken fingers so id take my chances.  So I follow suit, the worker sees me coming,  hits the corner,  then in amazing fashion grabs my 15 min old order off the oven.  Fills my drink w ice which I specifically asked for m none of.  No apology no nothing. Just a horrible expirience."}
{"text":"Bad Pizza the pizza was very greasy lousy place to eat the pizza crust was hard I could not eat it."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Went there for UFC night. We had a party of six but two of our friends weren't there yet when we arrived. The manager told us that tables are first come first serve and forced us to a four people table. Super pissed off because majority of the party were already there, like why the fuck can't you just give us a slightly bigger table or arrange more chairs. He later on told us that if our friends don't make it there in 5-10 minutes there will not be a table for six. SERIOUSLY DUDE, WE GOT THERE EARLY JUST SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A TABLE FOR SIX AND YOU HAD TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US AND ENDED UP HAVING US TO LEAVE EVEN BEFORE THE FIGHT STARTED. I am definitely never going back there again. Did not feel like I was being treated properly with respect and at the same time the manager (I asked for his name, Dino) was giving us the worst possible attitude! Now I understand why its always so empty there even when big fights are playing."}
{"text":"My wife and I like going to Boston Pizza because we know the menu and like most things. We have gone to this Boston Pizza location on and off for years now and it is by far the worst location we have ate at. Almost every time we order from here they screw it up some how. Forgetting things, undercooked, late delivery, the list could go on and on. We go out of our way now to go to the location in Okotoks or Deerfoot Meadows."}
{"text":"The menu is changed new items looks good but tasted awful! I ordered pizzaburgers the meat was raw it was really gross! I hope i dont get sick from it!  The service was slower than usual! This place sux fo real"}
{"text":"Actually had a good experience here.  Came with the family - 11 of us total.  The waitress Amanda just \"got it\". She understood we had 4 kids so she took care of the kids stuff first (got them drinks and pizza earlier than the rest of our food .  Pizza wasn't super filling and just was healthy. Had a really good experience over all.  Thanks Amanda"}
{"text":"This was actually my first time dining-in since 3 years ago. Usually I'd always order, since they have free delivery (yay!). 

Anyways, we got a coupon for free cactus cut fries and decided to bring it in. When our waitress saw it, she brought it to the back to ask the manager about it. When she came back, we had to remind her of the coupon and if it was still valid. She murmured that it was, half heartedly took our order and left. 

We ordered cactus cut fries, which were just thick potato chips. The dip was really good though! It's normally priced at around $10, which I think is ridiculous for a plate of chips.

We also got shrimp tacos. In my opinion, shrimp tacos should be very light, with some kind of salsa and lime inside it. But the one I got had BATTERED shrimp, cheddar cheese, tortilla strips, lettuce and tomatoes. It was just too heavy of a taco.

The inside is pretty typical of what you'd see in a family restaurant. Dark lighting, a fake fireplace, TV's with muted sound.

Overall, I thought Boston Pizza was A-OK. Not the best food I've ever had, but I think I'll stick to ordering delivery from this place, if not only to avoid the low energy service."}
{"text":"If you're into burnt chicken breast and tasteless pasta then this is the place for you! The restaurant is almost always empty giving it a really uncomfortable feel. The only reason I'm giving two stars to this place is because of today's server Patrick, the guy was really professional."}
{"text":"The food from this location has made me ill on more than one occasion. I don't think I will take my chances with Boston Pizza anymore. As for the restaurant itself, -it's an average Boston Pizza atmosphere, with fairly average service. The restaurant is newer and well kept... But doesn't redeem itself from the lousy, often undercooked food. Save yourself from getting food poisoning and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order through yelp and the food was ready upon arrival. Went just for pepperoni pizza and it is a solid choice. Had a philly sandwich as well which tasted like what I was craving. Wish they would improve the decor a bit so it looked cleaner because the food is quite good."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed !!

Ordered supper and said THREE times I wanted thin, thin, ultra thin crust.  They delivered normal (or thick) crust.  Had to throw 1/2 of it out.  Asked for Wings with BBQ sauce on the side.  They arrived wet.  My wife could (did) not eat.  Then for a small pizza and 8 wings was almost $ 50.00.  Which we threw 1/2 out.  Other BP locations have been positive experiences.

Phoned to complained.  She spoke empathetic words, but for the most part the attitude was just \"too bad\"?  Will not order from them again and I am here every month and will let others know of my experience."}
{"text":"Why is the Boston Smoky mountain come wth a bucket of pasta and one meat ball and no sauce. Pasta needs better ratio. Location is good and food is good."}
{"text":"This location seems to have plates that are smaller than the others.

The bar was clean and the music was good. TVs are in view everywhere."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best kept secrets in Vegas.  Love this place!  They are heavy on the cheese (which is great) so be careful if you ask for extra cheese.  We got pizza and wings.  Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Waited at least an hour for my meal and the table across from me got theirs free because of their wait. But I waited longer and got less food. Service was poor and unresponsive. Seemed busy but I wouldn't return anytime soon (this was written by my 12 yr old son who eats nearly anything and almost never complains about eating out because we do it so rarely.  Methinks it was really awful)."}
{"text":"I have been to a handful of Boston Pizza restaurants but this Rutherford one is the location I always go to because it's local and the most convenient. It's located in the plaza right in front of Vaughan Mills mall and it's hard to miss. They usually have seasonal specials and promotions that they have signs and menus for. Once in a while, I will order from their bar drink menu. The flavour of their drinks is usually pretty good, but the alcoholic content totally depends on the bartender making the drink. Sometimes it's overwhelming and other times it's barely there. 

Their service is a hit or miss depending on which side of the restaurant you're seated in. You can choose which section you want. I used to always sit in the dining room side of the restaurant but now I have discovered that service is better in the sports bar side of the restaurant with all the TVs. It's easier to flag down the servers/bartenders on this side because they're usually at the bar, as opposed to the dining room side where the servers are usually hiding in the kitchen or at the side server station. It's almost impossible to get their attention or flag them down for anything on the dining room side. Service is usually quick and friendly - multitasking server/bartender takes order, brings over the food, checks in once or twice, and presents the bill at the end of the meal.

Most of the time, I'm going to BP for their Pasta Tuesday specials, when they have all their gourmet pastas for a promo price, which is now $11.99 before tax. I do like that they now offer their Pasta Tuesday specials for takeout and delivery in addition to dine in. Previously, it was exclusive to dine in meals only. Although most of their pasta selection is good, my personal recommendations for their pastas are the Spicy Sausage Arrabbiata Penne and the Jambalaya Fettuccini. Both are packed with a generous portion of meats and other veggie toppings. The sauces for both these pasts is also very tasty - both are spicy with the right amount of heat and flavour. 

If I am there on any other weekday that is not Tuesday, I always end up ordering the Chicken Parmesan (breaded chicken topped with marinara and mozzarella) because it comes with garlic toast, veggies, and choice of a side dish (recommend spaghetti with bolognese sauce). For appetizers, I highly recommend their Cactus Cut Potatoes (try subbing the sauce for bolognese sauce, it's even better!) and the Thai Chicken Bites. Both starters are packed with delicious and spicy flavours. 
Ultimately, it's the Pasta Tuesday and these 3 dishes that make me a returning customer to Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"I admittedly love this chain. I was supposed to go to Union Social Eatery with my brother, sister in law, and two nieces but besides it definitely not being for children, there was a 40 minute wait for a booth and the manager was a bit snooty, so I walked a little farther down to Boston Pizza.
From schooners to appetizers, mud slides to perogie pizzas, I basically love everything on the menu.
I walked into this location with my brother and his family and we we're seated very quickly.
We were then left there waiting. The service was terrible, we couldn't flag down our server. My salad was overpriced and the lettuce was not crisp. 
The adults meals came out 20 minutes before the children's. We asked 3 times for their food and didn't so much as get an apology when it arrived.
Not fond of this place and will not return."}
{"text":"The cactus fries nachos are amazing!! Those are one of the things you should try here. We also ordered a veggie pizza, 7 cheese ravioli, and Thai chilli chicken wings which were all delicious and made perfectly. A sangria and a fishbowl were ordered too, the taste was really good but they only filled half the fishbowl which was disappointing. What was more disappointing was our server. Can't remember her name but she was not the friendliest. She wasn't rude or mean but not once did she smile  or start a friendly conversation with us. Throughout the night she seemed very apprehensive and unsure about everything we said; sounded kind of nervous. She was also very soft spoken which made it hard to hear her with the loud music. Not sure if it was her first day but serving and customer service is not for her."}
{"text":"Need to clean this place better.  Always dirty.  Food is mediocre bad italian food.  Pizza's are one of the worst.  Always raw dough in centre.  Better italian elsewhere now."}
{"text":"Seated next to kitchen, we didn't say anything even though other booths were available. Ordered wings as appetizer and a large deluxe pizza. Wings came literally a minute or two before the pizza. The pizza wasn't hot, it was warm. Uneven dough so where it was thicker, wasn't cooked through. Bland is how we would describe the pizza."}
{"text":"The one thing about Boston Pizza is their extensive.  There are also a soccer number of pizzas to choose from as well.

The kids meals were very good as well."}
{"text":"We decided to sit in the patio area, however it was clear that there was a lag in clearing the filthy ashtrays on the tables. If an establishment allows smoking, then there needs to be a commitment to clear the tables as appropriate. 

The kids menu is the best I've seen, and offers a great selection. The appetizers are a little higher priced for the food, and we split the Thai Chicken Bites. It is more like a cutlet sliced with Presidents Choice Memories of Thai sauces with stale udon noodles for around $11.00. We also shared a corned beef sandwich with cold fries (we don't need them anyway). We also were billed around $10.00 for a glass of house wine, but I got a massive coors lite for $6.99.

Overall, the patio was nice, the food fair, and the kids menu a home run.

{"text":"A decent restaurant/bar right across from the baseball stadium. It gets busy right before game time. 
There are two floors and a bar on the first floor. I didn't go upstairs so I'm not sure of the set up there. 
Service was fast and polite. Our waitress was nice and came by just enough to check on us. Drinks were filled once they were empty. I ordered the large nachos for the table and it was plenty of the three of us. The pizza came out right as we were finishing up the nachos which was pretty good timing. 
I would be back for a quick bite when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"I went here.  It was 5pm on a Saturday. It was not bad for an early kid-friendly restaurant. I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"With extra large drinks and a solid menu, I dunno why i've kinda avoided BP for quite some time... East Side Marios is so going downhill, so for a sit down place with some decent pasta n pizza selection is what I require from time to time. I had a Taco Penne and is was darn good.... along with a schooner (32oz) pint, brings a smile to my face :) Good spot."}
{"text":"Food here is really good and staff is accommodating. 

I've had: cheese pizza, supreme style pizza, fries, wings & a tuna wrap.
The tuna wrap is my go to for sure. 

Their daily specials are cheap especially for the area they're in."}
{"text":"Not my first choice. I stopped in for a late dinner. Service was great, seating was immediate, and the servers were there, but not overbearing. 

The food was a bit of a letdown. I ordered the half rack of ribs, with a side of spaghetti and bolognese sauce. The ribs instantly reminded me of Swiss Chalet, which is suspicious, since they are right next door. Just a coincidence. 

The pasta was pasty. Not al dente, but just soft. My dinner guest had the ravioli and it was about the same, as if it had been boiled for too long, cooled and then boiled again. The sauce was very different as well. It had a significant bite to it, more like chili with very little tomato flavour. 

The side of mixed vegetables, mostly broccoli and cauliflower were soaking wet and devoid of flavour. Just this soft mushy texture and not much else to it. 

From the parking lot, 30 steps less and I would have been at Swiss Chalet instead. Might have been the better choice."}
{"text":"I stopped in at about 6:30 on a Monday for a quick dinner. I grew up eating Boston Pizza, but I had not been here in a long time.   The menu is large, with a wide array of sports bar type meals. I opted for the Seafood Fettucini, which is a good measure of how well a kitchen handles a variety of components. 

The dish arrived in the standard pasta bowl. The seafood part was really about 5 medium-small shrimp and 5 decent sized scallops and was cooked perfectly, the scallops especially had not been cooked to rubber. The pasta was just at the edge of al dente. Where some joints would just throw delicate seafood in with pasta and cook everything to death, these must have been cooked separately, or timed properly. 

But the sauce was absolutely flavourless. A bit like reduced milk. A healthy portion of fresh Parmesan on top was not enough to impart some flavour. The piece of dry toast representing Garlic Bread was not edible. For an $18 entree, this is not a value. 

I followed up with desert to try an get a more vibrant flavour.  They feature a new desert called \"Doughcano\" at $8 which is essentially a chocolate cake with chocolate sauce wrapped in their pizza dough and deep fried. The idea is great, but pizza dough?  It was a match like peanut butter and anchovy.  With every bite I couldn't stop thinking about the clash of flavours. A sweet dough, like a Mexican desert would have worked, but this was just unnerving. I left 3/4 uneaten. 

I think I can now recall why I have not been here in several years."}
{"text":"Honestly,  nothing special.  The pizza tastes like cafeteria pizza and service was subpar.  Skip this and go some place better."}
{"text":"Busy place on a Friday night.  Probably because it's the only major restaurant within the immediate vicinity of the Walmart and Canadian Tire plaza.  And they were playing the Blue Jays versus Yankees game on the television sets which was another reason why.  Service was a bit slower than the other Boston Pizza locations we've been to in the past.  Don't get me wrong...Our server was great.  It was just the time it took for the food to come out.  Maybe because it was a busy night?  Who knows.  We ordered the Butter Chicken Pizza...Meh.  Not much of a taste to it.  Too many chopped tomato and green onion on top.  On the other hand, our double order of fried chicken wings and the Mediterranean salad wasn't bad.  In general, if I wasn't that terribly hungry in the area, this location wouldn't have been my first choice."}
{"text":"Depends on the type of pizza you order, but the pizzas we ordered were kind of on the sweet side (BBQ chicken and BBQ pulled pork).  Their cactus potato slices aren't bad for an appetizer and the same goes for their chicken wings.  I don't mind this location.  Have been here a few times already."}
{"text":"I excepted more from this Boston Pizza. I used to be a fan of the chain but this location has turned me off from the brand. The food was mediocre. Service was ok. Too many issues like forgetting the dressing in the salad, then saying  that customers don't like it in it so we decided not to give you the dressing. I'm not going to return here. Maybe it's because  it is a Sunday, but they still should have some standards."}
{"text":"In Vegas for my best friends wedding, and after a long night of gambling, we started to get hungry around 2 am. Our local friend took us to Bostons.  Looks like it should be an \"adult\" store from the outside and the location, but the inside was like walking into an old school pizzeria. The man working the counter was very cool to us, gave us the big Tuesday special even though it was Wednesday, and joked around with us while we waited. The pizza's are very good, plenty of cheese and they don't skimp on toppings. Next time in Vegas I'm hitting here with the drunk munchies."}
{"text":"8/25 Ordered for delivery late night. They forgot an order in the bag. All the rest was there except for the wings and fries we ordered. Totally frustrating when  you call and the guy puts you on hold for so long you have no choice but to hang up and try again later. Paid $9 for wings I never received. The food we did get was ok. Had a burger that was cooked the way I asked. 
Not the worst or best place to eat late night. But with the order mess up and lack of response to get someone to help they only get 2 stars from me. 

Will update later if I ever get someone to answer and credit my card for the money they took and didn't deliver an item for.

Update 8/26
So the delivery driver contacted me the next day as promised and said he would be coming to deliver the wings. We got them as promised- a nice surprise. The wings themselves were dry and not sauced but it came with a tiny side of sauce. The fries were good. 
Overall I'm changing my rating from 2 to 3 stats. Just because the food was average and the hold time when calling in is ridiculous. I called a few times and was put on hold each time with no one ever coming back to the line. If it hadn't been the fact that  I had the delivery drivers phone number from when he called to deliver the order, I might have never gotten in contact with anyone to get the order fixed."}
{"text":"Went to Boston pizza for lunch at this location, they have lunch special from 11am to 3pm $10 lunch combos, lots of variety, comes with a side too. They are not busy during lunch time, so if you want a quiet place for lunch around scarborough, chitchat with your friend, this is the ideal place. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Sad to say BP going down in service/quality. Their pizza is still good but for the price they are charging...idk. You can find better for similar prices. 

Just recently went here on Sunday for dinner and ordered oven roasted wings with honey garlic sauce and a medium Hawaiian pizza. We waited quite a while and when the pizza finally arrived... it was cold. Had to ask for them to reheat it. The pizza did taste good and was very cheesy but serving it to us cold was disappointing and almost inexcusable since they are known mainly as a PIZZA place. Furthermore, the wings were not that great. The sauce didn't really seem settled in the wings but more just hastily spread and then wings plopped into the oven. 

For drinks, we ordered a beer and their daily Sunday special (Caesar drink for $4). For the beer, I guess we should have been specific but our server just assumed we wanted the more expensive regular then sleeve size and didn't say anything to us about it. We let it go and asked for extra glasses but even then she only came back with 1 huge mug (we were a party of 3). We didn't even get water unless expressly asking for it. For the Caesar drink, while it looks nice... it tasted a bit weird. :/ 

Next time, If you are in the mood for pizza...I suggest checking out Little Caesars for crazy bread and deep dish pizza (so good and only $10 but their regular style is not as good) and for wings... I suggest St. Louis."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night for my parents . Ordered a large bacon cheese classic pizza and starter fried wings with new flavour sambala chilli. The total came to $48. My dad said the price was too expensive for a large pizza and wings. The wings came with 2 sticks of celery instead of fries."}
{"text":"Worst Boston pizza experience I've ever had. 4/5 dishes we ordered were cold. Service was less than friendly, also cold and short.  Kind of unusual as the place was not busy in the least. When we mentioned to the manager about our issues instead of fixing the problems we had he decided that the best he could do was discount our bill by 25%. Next time we will take our money to a fast food location, where staff is pleasant and they serve their menu items as described and at the appropriate temperature. Step it up BP you're killing your reputation."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. I used to love this place but recently the prices have gone up while the quality has gone down. I got a small Boston special, a pizza with everything. It's pretty filling and good. I guess I should just stick to ordering that in the future. 

I also got the chicken fingers, ugh, so bad. They were flat wafers of what's supposed to be chicken. How is it that it's almost $10 for chicken fingers with fries and there aren't decent sized pieces of chicken? What you get are flat, over-cooked, dry, salty, over battered, over priced, unappealing \"chicken.\" So disappointing."}
{"text":"New game changing tip! 

That's right! I literally mean games! So my friends and I don't watch much sports, so we usually just head over there for dinner. But now they have a new thing...a board game shelf! From Connect 4 to Drunk, Stoned, or Stupid, they have a variety of games that you can now play simply by just asking for them at the hostess stand out front. 

When we first saw this, it definitely kept me and my friends there longer than usual. It turned a simple dinner into a whole night activity since we didn't have to find a board game bubble tea cafe to head to afterwards (like we usually do).

Overall Boston Pizza, good call on adding games, I'll definitely be back to play the rest!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, terrible service, long wait. Just horrible. I ordered delivery, they sent me the most disgusting tasteless food ever, I order something else instead and it's been over an hour ... Still no food. I live five minutes away."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Boston Pizza. 

Whenever I am craving a good deep-pan pizza on a Friday night, we come here to relax and enjoy a good hearty meal. The atmosphere and layout of this particular BP is much nicer than the others in the South Shore (maybe as its fairly newer). They have a great family seating section with comfy banquettes far away from the rowdy bar area. It is always packed during peak times and sometimes you need to wait a while for a table.
Don't think I need to mention the food... there is something for everyone here! I myself being a big fan of the cactus potatoes accompanied by the spicy dip and the big hot cookie dough dessert that is topped with ice cream and chocolate sauce (a must try - I get it every single time!)
Service is usually very good, the staff are nice and friendly. 
Your ideal foodie family friendly restaurant & bar!"}
{"text":"My friends and I will usually stop by here on a late night or after a concert. We love it here, the food's always great, piping hot (ouch), and large portions! However, the wait to be seated always takes an extremely long time.. We went on a Monday night at 11PM, where the entire bottom floor was empty, but it still took half an hour to be seated, after an additional 15 minutes for the hostess to even acknowledge us.
Also, the other night, they only had one girl running both the bar, and the floor to take orders and deliver food. I felt awful for her, especially since what seemed to be the manager? (blue shirt) was just standing right beside us at a table, talking to and flirting with this guy she knew (?) the entire time we were there. 
It was only when I started to get (kinda loudly) annoyed, as I had a bus to catch that came hourly, that the manager (?) decided to listen to our conversation and grab us our bills after we had already asked 20 minutes prior. 
I don't blame the girl running the floor and bar at all, she was doing an amazing job despite the stress. But, the blue shirted woman.. You need to do your job, not flirt for 45 minutes straight and let this poor girl run the entire floor. I wish I could only tip her.
We'll be back, of course, but this experience was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Came on an early Wednesday morning at 1:30 and they still run the promotion for buy one get one free. Plus the pizza is worth it. Definitely my pizza place to go to."}
{"text":"The service was awful. Waited over ten minutes to be greeted at our table. This was after the manager confronted the hostess about an issue in front of us before seating us. We weren't asked how our meL was until we were almost done. Oh and I wasn't informed of a charge for extra sour cream. I enjoy Boston Pizza but I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Understaffed 

Went there on a Sunday Afternoon, our waiter must have went on break, because we sat in silence for 20 minutes waiting for the bill. We decided to go up to the front and pay, and ended up waiting for even longer trying to grab the attention of one of the two waiters. Left thirsty because the water refills we asked for never came. 

Pizza was meh, TV dinner stuff I could microwave myself."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents for an late lunch after my flight from Vancouver.  I was pleasantly surprised by both the decor (upscale compared to other locations) and the food (fresh and tasty).  We sat in the lounge to avoid the screaming kids in the dining room.   The lounge has a ton of televisions, which would make this a great place to watch hockey games (or figure skating, which was on today).  Our waitress was really nice and there was never a time when our drinks were empty.  It was probably the best service I've received at a Boston Pizza in a long time.  I had the penne with bolognese sauce baked with cheese, and it was fantastic, even though the garlic toast was smaller than it used to be years ago.  

I normally don't go to Boston Pizza because I find that the quality has significantly decreased compared to a few years ago.  However, when I come to visit my parents again, I will definitely go back to this location.  If you're in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"I like the menus and specials Boston Pizza puts together and have never had an issue with BP food wherever I've gone. This location has a ton of parking, is close to Sarcee & Richmond for easy access and while steady, the traffic flowing so there is rarely a wait.

But the service at this location can be touch-and-go. I have always found staff to be friendly but inattentive at times. That said, not enough to keep me from coming back because more often than not I leave with a full stomach, emptier wallet and I'm happy with my choice."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!  This is the place to check out!  My favorite it the Philly cheesesteak and chicken fingers"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in years.
Thankfully this is close to home, and as a surprise, it was not busy during dinner time on a Monday evening.
Finding a seat was not an issue, so we took advantage of the bar booths available.  
The place was quiet, clean, and presentable.  OUr server, who was lovely and very personable advised us of their daily specials. 
Both my buddy and I caught up over a pitcher of Rickards red, and for grub, we chose to have wings.  What can I say? Beer and wings go hand in hand.  We ordered their dry- mild wings were quite delicious as it complimented our drinks.  
Though full, somehow my sweet tooth got to me, and I could not resist their dessert menu.  After a few minutes my baked apple crumble with a lump of vanilla ice cream appeared on my table :) it was love at first bite.....complete bliss..... though I had to run 5km the following morning, the calorie intake was worth it! haha...overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This is seriously bland food. I've given Boston Pizza a try... twice... and found that you can get anything on the menu almost anywhere else, done better."}
{"text":"Large selection of food on the menu, quality is mediocre to above average from what I experienced, see below

Had the hot wings = tasty but not that spicy, small mini size, but again very good, ate all

Had the sliders (3) = mediocre, ate 1.5 of them

Had steak and onion topped pizza (individual size) = delicious, ate all 

Table service in bar area is above average

Bottom line, I would recommend for a sports bar-like meal, beverages, and watching the game. Nine TVs in bar area including one large projection TV on back wall. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"They have football trivia during MNF. Do they have this at every Boston Pizza? I think they have it here every MNF.

And the questions can't be that hard, though I get feeling they have some \"locals\" who may come often. Nevertheless, free hats of the teams that play. Not bad.

Food, well general Boston Pizza food, nothing to write home about. But it's steady.
I had the Jambalaya Pasta, a decent option.

I think though I come here when it's my Birthday and I get a free meal. Though this year the coupon said dine-in only.

Look out for MNF trivia with prizes and free pasta or dessert for your birthday when you sign up online."}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza is awesome! Fast, friendly service and the food is hot and tastes great. If you're in the area and looking for a spot to eat stop here!"}
{"text":"This place is always a winner!  Great pizza and wine.  We've been going here for about 7 years.  Bring on the Boston Royal!"}
{"text":"So I ordered some food, they delivered the wrong food. When I called to let them know the lady I spoke to questioned my intelligence of knowing what cheese looks like. How are you going to question if I know what cheese looks like. Will never order from them again and I will let every person that works in my building know never to eat there either. Why is good customer service so hard to find!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underdelivered. I was disappointed. I got half of BBQ chicken and half of their famous popular Boston Pizza with olives shrimps and ham. Tasted not that great for 28$. Shrimp wasnt fresh. Size is small. The staff overall isnt the best, but our waiter was nice. Overall I wouldnt go there at all."}
{"text":"Okay enough pizza but I never thought I'd say this: too much cheese. They don't scrimp on oil with the food either. My pizza was on the soggy side and required several napkins to soak up the extra grease."}
{"text":"We always get a bucket of wings, medium and a bucket of fries. They are always amazing and their Ranch is to die for!! I have had other items on the menu like cheese steaks and pizza. All of it was good but for me the wings are by far the best thing they make!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night and it took about 5 minutes for them to seat me and 4 other guests the service was ok they brought our food out within 15 minutes of ordering also the waitress was really calm and patient they brought us the wrong wings but they were curious enough to bring the right order and didnt even charge for us for any appetizers"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and they hardly put pizza sauce this place is horrible and the cashier bitch fuck her & her additude"}
{"text":"I have never before seen a manager understaffed and ok with customers walking out the door without fixing the issue or insuring the customer will come back. The manager sat in his office and let his one server ignore all her tables on a wing night beside a sports centre. When we got his attention and asked for service he sat in his office and said \"what do you want me to do?\" We said \"help?\" And he rolled his eyes and went \"pfft\". As we left he said have a good night. I think this is pathetic and a poor attempt at making sure teams continue to come back. Embarrassing."}
{"text":"In a nut shell the best thing was the music... The manager is sexist however the waitress Sara was very polite and kept apologizing as if it was her fault the food we got was cold.. Don't order the steak bacon wrapped skewers complete waste... The onion rings along with it was burnt to a crisp they crumbled at the touch... And for some reason the pulled pork pasta had fries and onion rings that I assume they tried I pass off as caramelized onions such a shame... I'd never come back it's not worth the money or time I should've went to mc Donald's which by the way is directly across the street .... Sorry BP go back to Boston"}
{"text":"Came here late on a Monday night, for some after bowling grub.
We chose this particular restaurant because they are open late which is a plus. 

Once we entered the restaurant we were told to \"go find a seat\" in the bar as the dining room was closed off for the night.

We opted for some appetizers of spinach dip and nachos.
The nachos were fantastic as was the spinach dip!

Out of the 4 of us, I was the only one who ordered an entree salad.
Once the food was brought out, I noticed that I was given something completely different than I ordered...
I ordered a chicken salad and was given a beet salad..... Gross.

While we attempted to get our server's attention (eventually having to walk over to the bar to get her)
She asked me what was wrong? 
Umm well i clearly did not ask for a BEET salad...
She apologized and put in an order for a new salad.
So I sat for 15 minutes while my friends ate their meal, then I got mine.. And they got to wait for me.

The salad was delicious, i'll give them that... But it was also humongous... Easily could have fed 3 people on it. I ended up not eating more than half of it.. Such a waste.

Our service wasn't top notch clearly, our server never came back to refill our drinks at all, she charged us for BOTH salads, which she took one off once it was pointed out to her. 
I didn't pay for the meal but if I did I can't say I would have left much of a tip.

Oh also, the washrooms are up 2 flights of stairs... Kinda oddly placed and not accessible for everyone.

1.5/5"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 16 people 5 days in advance for saturday night at 8pm.
Upon arrival, we all noticed how incredibly hot it was in the restaurant and within 15 minutes we were all stripping off layers complaining about the heat.
Our waitress was completely overwhelmed with our group due to the size and carried a clipboard so she could keep track.
She was slow, easily confused, forgot to bring drinks for my guests multiple times   and was bringing out food 2 dishes at a time, so while some of us were eating, most weren't.
One of my guests asked twice about when her salad was coming out since everyone else already had their order.
The second time she asked about it, the server's like ''YEA i know, i already asked them about it''
to which my guest replied, ''Yea well this is ridiculous''.
The server then went back into the kitchen and grabbed a cold soggy salad for my  guest to which she did not eat. thankfully she comp'ed the salad.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side caesar salad.
The pulled pork was delicious, but the caesar salad was disgusting, it was completely DRENCHED in dressing.

Multiple guests who ordered salad complained about the same thing.

Since it was my birthday they did do the whole brownie/icecream singing charade which was cute but at that point was not a saving grace..

60% of my guests were not impressed with their food, and service.

I definitely will not be going back here, and i'm gonna bet that 90% of my guests left either a crappy tip or none at all."}
{"text":"Let's not kid ourselves. There is nothing Boston about this place. One of the owners of this place (Jim Treliving) also owns Mr. Lube and can be seen on the Canadian TV show on CBC Dragon's Den.

However, I like to look at Boston Pizza restaurants as a sports bar. A clean, modern technologically capable sports bar. No seriously, no matter which BP you go to, they have enough TVs to make sure you never miss that crucial moment of any sport. They even have TVs in their dinning room while the large screens are usually reserved for the bar.

This location is no different.  Large screens, LCDs and projectors in the bar, several more smaller screens in the dining room.  This ensures that no matter where you are seated, you will find a screen starring back at you.

I've been to this location twice, both for UFC nights.  Yes, like most bars/restaurants that shows UFC, there is a cover fee. It's $5, even if you arrived before the fight started. Fair enough.  Main UFC coverage bouts usually begins at 9pm.

The staff can be accommodating to your party, provided you are reasonable and give them ample time.  They do not take reservations an hour before the fight so that it becomes a first come first serve basis.  Again, I think this is fair because if you seriously want to catch the fight, you should arrive early in order to get seats for yourself and your friends.

The foods offered here is your basic restaurant and bar fare.  The wings are pretty good, though they can be a bit bigger. Where they really shine is the pasta dishes and sandwiches I find. I've yet to be disappointed by their foods.  I don't normally order the pizza, but it's not half bad. It is what it is, sports bar food. Don't expect Michelin starred inspired techniques or ingredients. You're in a SPORTS bar!

They change their menu every now and then, which is great because it means they are consistently trying new things.  I usually get the lasagna, with the generous amount of sauce and ground beef.  They have pretty good cheesecake too.  The choices of beer on tap is good with all of the standard selections like Keith's, Coors, Blue, Guiness, Rickard's, Corona, etc.  There is bound to be one beer you would drink here.

Service is not bad either, I usually give the waitresses slack for not being too quick on super busy nights like UFC.  They are attentive and have not disappointed me yet.  

Parking can be a challenge if you're not used to it, it's right above the Yonge/Sheppard station. I usually park on the streets across from BP where it's free after 9pm on all evenings.

BP at Yonge/Sheppard is a good neighbourhood bar, if I lived in the area I would probably go here more often."}
{"text":"Good pizza, lots of toppings, thick crust style . Not trendy thin crisp crust here, loads of cheese and meats on dough

Service is first rate"}
{"text":"This pizza made my day!! I was craving pizza foe 2 days and searched this place on Yelp. I was completely syprised how awesome my veggie pizza was. Good to the last bite"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! We ordered food and paid with a credit card and never got our food. We called and called and they kept brushing us off. Never again stay away from this place what a rip off"}
{"text":"I've been going to this specific location for years with my family. I've been noticing the quality and service declining for awhile now. The last time we were in was last weekend and the service was awful. I don't know if this was this young woman's first week on the job but she was incredibly rude. We had just been seated when she approached the table and asked if we knew what we wanted to order. We asked for our drinks and then asked for more time to look at the menu. 
When she returned after literally 3 min to ask what we wanted to order. I said we would order the kids meals and need more time to figure out what we wanted. I was in the middle of my kids order when she rudely interrupted me and said \"can you hurry up and order because it's very busy here tonight\". I replied with \"I am ordering and your interrupting me\". She smiled and said \"ok cause it's busy here tonight\" (it was NOT busy at all!! There were maybe 10 tables with people at them and at least 4 staff serving) 
Now I understand that they may have been short staffed but you don't interrupt a customer mid sentence to tell them your too busy to help them. I was speaking with my partner and I'm sure other servers heard me because all of a sudden our kids food appeared and the manager was at our table taking our order. He too was not the nicest person. Seemed to be frazzled about something. Ok your having a bad shift. Don't take it out on customers. 
All in all the food was ok, not the best I've had at this location, and since this is not the first negative experience I think we will go to another location from now on."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here. I've got to say, they are definitely quick service but very, very rude. I pulled out my ID as I know I look very much under 40, and she definitely examined my drivers license for a while and then threw it back to me in a rude way. That wasn't an issue but kind of gave me a bad taste in my mouth. 

I wanted to order the new Mediterranean Bowtie pasta bowl in a half size, which was suggested on the menus because it is calorie wise or whatnot. I ordered and she preceded to tell me they don't do half orders of pasta... Although I've ordered half orders every time I come to Boston Pizza. 

The last time I came here, service was sparse as the waitress stood on the side talking to her friend. Our drinks were not refilled once and we had to actually request the bill at the front after 45 minutes of waiting. 

The food on the other hand was of course Boston pizza quality giving it an extra star in my opinion 

TL;DR: Service sucks. Food is okay."}
{"text":"Excellent visit this Sunday. Thanks the new lasagna was amazing and our server Jessi was super. We I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great experience tonight to watch the Leafs game. Terrific food and service. Manager came by and the welcome us as well. We will be back"}
{"text":"Boston Pizza has always been one of my favourite places to eat. I am thrilled that they have a half decent veggie burger as well as other vegetarian options! :)

The reason that the are not getting 5 stars at this location is 1) The the server was average and didn't really do anything to 'wow' me. But it's only a BP not a 5 star restaurant here haha. so what can you expect right!?...anyway

 2) It was later in the evening and was not very busy. Food came quick and buddy made sure we always had everything we needed. The only awkward part was when my husband and I were sitting there and we could hear EVERYTHING the kitchen staff were saying.  They kept laughing really REALLY loudly and Swearing non-stop. I mean I just felt embarrassed listening to them talk and what if kids were sitting right there instead of us! ? I don't think that was very good. I think they should know better not to swear while at work especially in an open kitchen like that. Just sayinn' 

I will be back because I'm addicted to the food. But maybe try and be a little more professional guys or you are gonna get an ear full from an angry momma bear someday when they hear ya swearing like a sailor in front of their kids! ;) CHEERS"}
{"text":"Went here on Mother's day and it was pretty good. The staff were very friendly. Had the veggie burger (which is really good btw) . Only bad thing was they did put these weird onions on it .... like instead of the nice crunchy larger cut red onion slices  ...it was like a mush of chewy grossness that was impossible to chew.. haha it like was actually really gross .. please fix your onions lol. other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Your local Boston Pizza with decent food served with a smile.

The location of this BP's is a huge convenience for me, so I've popped by a few times. Generally, I enjoy the food at BP's and know that it's a safe bet for a late night meal or a casual beer on the way back home. For this location, I have only been on the lounge side and it was a whole wall of VLT's with plenty of large TVs that have various sports events on. The service I've received at this location has always been good and friendly with the generally above average food I've come to expect.

I'm sure I'll be back for more perogy pizza and boston brute sandwiches in the future."}
{"text":"Came here with my family last week, food was great, service was ok. will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite and enjoyed my visit as I always have in the past.   We started off with the Southwest Flatbread -  BBQ chicken, bacon, red onions,  with BBQ sauce and pizza mozzarella,  topped with ranch dressing - excellent flavour combination, great starter.   We also had the chicken wings but I made a mistake in getting them Hot because they were way  too hot for me.  The kind of hot where you can't enjoy the food, but that was my fault as the wings themselves were pretty good.  We finished off with the The Starting Lineup - a platter with Cactus Cut Potatoes, Three-Cheese Toast, Bandera Pizza Bread and we opted for 2 orders of wings in Thai Chili and Honey Garlic, a much needed relief after those super hot wings.  The items in the platter are all pretty good, especially the Bandera Pizza Bread which has a very familiar taste but I can't quite put my finger on it.  The three cheese toast however really isn't anything special.  
The food was good, the service was good, no complaints here."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places and has been around for a long time. It serves up a great Philly steak cheese with jalapeños!  The pizza is good, but I've had better. Please don't take this the wrong way because again I love this place and it has feed me and my staff on numerous occasions when working late downtown! Can't go wrong with anything you order especially for the price. To clarify on the pizza it's good!  Bottom line if you work downtown or live downtown and its late night you will be happy. For lunch this place is great and of course they always deliver. The delivery time for lunch is a little lengthy, but somewhat worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Boston Pizza and given the large amount of Restaurants in this plaza, I don't see any reason why I should come back.

The service was okay but honestly the food was not even worth half it's price. DO NOT get their cactus cut potatoes!! Why would you pay $9 to get plain potato chips with a plain yogurt dip?

And their pizza's that are supposed to be so good were far less tasty than any Pizza Pizza pizza so why am I paying $12 for an \"individual\" size pizza?

This should only be a last resort unless ALL the other restaurants in this plaza are full!!"}
{"text":"As this place is close to work it usually ends up being the choice for work lunches.  It's been renovated since it first opened so now it looks like a cosy home - dark woods, fireplace, nice lighting.  It's actually a pretty big space but it always seems empty.  Located in Aurora, right off the 404 it's in a plaza with a lot of parking available. 

We pre-ordered our meal and before we even had our coats off our meals were at the table.  I'm not a big fan of Boston Pizza in the first place but this is what our team decided to have lunch at. 

I ordered the small BBQ chicken pizza - it's about 8 small slices (more like 3 normal size slices ) but perfect for me for lunch as I didn't want to go back to work feeling full and heavy.  The pizza was good - you can choose thin or thick crust - it was saucy and there were enough chicken pieces on it so I didn't feel ripped off.  This size was about $10.

Service was super friendly all throughout the meal - we were are large group.

Nothing really wrong with BP but nothing that really that blew my cheese away either."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from here for a work function and it was okay. The pizzas we ordered were pepperoni, cheese and a combination. The pizza looked like it needed more sauce and they didn't have diet coke only Pepsi products. If your looking for ordinary pizza then order from here. It's way better than Pizza Hut and dominos..!"}
{"text":"We took the advantage of the superbowl buy one get one free offer!! We ordered Tropical Chicken and Boston Royal. Boston Royal was pretty yummy we substituted the olive to pineapple, glad that we were able to do so without extra cost!!! That was pretty cool. Tropical chicken was a little dry..... we ate it with creamy garlic dipping sauce still a little dry. I hoped they had more pineapple on it to make it more juicy. 

We ordered to go, pizzas were ready for pick up when we arrived! Not bad!!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Good Food, Portions, Prices and Service. Best cheesy, thick, yummy nachos with a generous helping of sour cream and salsa on the side. Get the extra guacamole. It is well worth it. Add a beer and you are all set for all the power shopping you need to do. Beats the food court on taste, portions, price and a decent place to hang out for awhile. Skip the food court. Head to BP."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch today - we haven't done boston pizza for a while.
Pros:  Patio with decent amount of seating
Food ~ meh.  I liked the shrimp tacos I had, they were light enough, and a good portion size for me.  My bf ordered a double bacon something burger - which he exclaimed part way through the meal as being cooked from frozen (ha ha, he's used to too many gourmet burgers available in our hood).  Boston Pizza isn't gourmet, so that's probably not a fair comparison.  But this place, is what it is, a sports bar/resto chain.
Our service today was ok, it started to fill up as we were getting through our meal and the server seemed to manage ok."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Boston Pizza. Prices are a little high for the food. Nothing fantastic. But the bar and specials is ridiculously awesome. 
Being from the Mississauga area, I'm used to the standard Boston Pizza deals. But this place has fantastic specials each day. 
Monday Madness,  Domestic Bottle Tuesday, Bad Boy Wednesday (corona or Heineken), Jack and Jill Thursday, Rail shot Friday, and mini jug Saturday. And on Sunday you can have any deal of the week for the same price. 
Each and every day or the week you can get 6.99 schooners, bucket of corona for 16 or MGD for 14.
Not bad for a little drinking during the week.  
The service is good and solid and I will be a regular here most likely during this summer of fun. 
There is also a patio and a McDonald's right across if you want a cheap meal right after these amazing drink prices! 
Have fun!"}
{"text":"Great spot for families, sports fans, or just a great place to have a great dining experience!!"}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza has one of the best sports bars in North York, if not THE best. Many TVs, surround sound stereo, a great bar that's well stocked with good booze, 30-oz schooner glasses that will eventually murder you if you keep downing them. The food is okay; at this location, the bar is king.

The dining room is decent, and you can enter either via Yonge Street or from within the Yonge-Sheppard Centre. Again, the food is decent. The dining room is ideal for kids. Boston Pizza also has probably the best gluten-free crusts of any of the chains, a big plus for people who worry about such things."}
{"text":"Best spot in Vegas! Have been coming here since I was a little kid.. The customer service is beyond amazing, and the food hits the spot. The wings and chicken fingers are the best in town!! Pizza and cheesesteaks are amazing too! Can't rave enough about Boston pizza!"}
{"text":"This was plan B after the front of house at Moxies was rude and the restaurant had absolutely no room.
Our group of 16 was sat in a large open space in the dining area. Several friends ordered the first round of drinks and as the waitress came to drop them off, she lost her focus and literally dropped an entire caesar's on my friend's jacket. She was apologetic but as my other friend yelled out - \"FREE DRINKS!\" I thought that was clearly the action that should have been taken... or some other sort of compensation.
However, none of that happened. The caesar's as charged... and the soda water that was suggested as a cleaning option was also included in the bill. On top of that - she made a rude joke about the bottle of wine we ordered to make sure that the restaurant did not waste more alcohol. The plate of yam fries were small and the cheesy bread was over salty and dry.
Thank god for lots of drinking and asian drinking games with a British guy in Chinese!"}
{"text":"The food is consistent with other BPs and the Calzone met my expectations of a healthier choice on their menu. 

However, I just cannot get over how poor the service was throughout the entire night, We started with a group of 5 in the bar and the waiter did not have more than 5 seconds of patience before running off.

He took 2 drink orders, left to put them in, came back and took 1 food order, left again. When he came back, I put in my drink order and before I had a chance to tell him what I wanted to eat, he had already left again. This happened over and over again throughout the night, making it very difficult to say anything without feeling like we were a waste of time.

Because of this, all our food came out at different times and by the time the last person's meal came, the first person had already finished their food.

When we were ready to get the bill, the same thing happened again. He came and went every couple of minutes to swipe the next person's credit card... Never a thank you for our business.

Maybe they need an extra person working at the bar.... So all their customers don't leave unhappy."}
{"text":"They get a 3 star from me solely on the wait time for the food. We came in for a quick lunch today and the lounge was dead. Other than us, I counted 6 other people. I ordered a half salad and my husband got some boneless wings (not something that takes a long time to cook). We waited a looooong time. Long enough to that we thought about putting money down for our drinks and just leaving. It finally came out and the food was good. Typically Boston pizza food we've all had over and over. Our waitress was pleasant and this was not her fault. 

The bar was clean and they had lots of advertising for cheap drinks and food, especially on game days! BP's is definitely the place to go for sports or with the kids."}
{"text":"This review is based on delivery of food. I like the new online ordering, super easy. They were fast and the order arrived on time but I found the food quality to be pretty bad. We ordered a Cesar salad and it was a handful of old, wilted romain, old rock hard croutons and some dressing on the side. No parm. Literally so unappetizing I couldn't eat it. Yes BPs is $$$ but it's barely changed since I was a kid. But they need to step up
Food quality."}
{"text":"Dropped by with my bf and friend at around 8pm on a Saturday night, walked in and we quickly determined the AC was cranked way too high for us to enjoy inside dining, so we opted for the patio. They seated us out on the comfy chairs they have, they were a bit dirty but not too bad cuz we requested it when they didn't have time to clean up properly after the last people were there.
Took quite a few minutes for the server to drop by, but when she did, she was super friendly and cheerful. She had a good sarcastic charm about her, and gladly provided our friend the gluten wise menu as we ordered our drinks. A bit later we were able to order our food. My BF and I got our food, but then the server realized she forgot to ring in our friends gluten free pizza. She apologized a lot and even gave our friend a 50% discount for not having the food out on time! :D overall we had good service, but waited quite a bit between ordering and stuff, but our server seemed to have been given more tables than the other servers."}
{"text":"It was busy and service was a little slow. I know better than to blame it on the restaurant however the plates could have been cleared a little more quickly"}
{"text":"À chaque fois que je suis allé mangé à cet endroit, j'ai été bien accueilli et servi. L'endroit est décontracte et le personnel est efficace. Seul petite chose, n'arriver pas en grand nombre en fin de soirée. Le chef se retrouve pas mal toute seule en cuisine et le service risque d'être long. L'aubaine du \"mardi pâtes en folies\" est une excellente idée. Vous avez une vaste variété de choix de pâtes à un prix raisonnable et avec une portion qui fait en sorte que vous devez repartir avec votre restant, tellement il y en a. On retrouve de tout au menu, mais comme  le nom le dit, la pizza est leur spécialité et elle est vraiment bonne. Pour les petites familles, il y a un menu pour enfant à un prix très abordable."}
{"text":"Too bad it's so hard to get parking due to the construction...ouch.

The pizza we ordered a Great White North was good, a bit over cooked.

Service and food generally good!."}
{"text":"Went here because me and my friends were in the area. I had to order from the gluten free menu, which at first glance has a lot of options. Since we were at a Pizza place, I ordered a small (personal?) gluten free pizza for $11. They only offer one size of gluten free pizza. When I received it, it was tiny. I wanted a pizza, not a bread stick. I ate the pizza in about 5 minutes. I am a 110 lb female. Then I went home to eat some dinner. The service was average. The manager was your typical chain manager. Making sure to do the serving protocol at all costs, even if that meant abruptly interrupting our conversation several times to ask how my bread stick tasted. My friends said I looked obviously disappointed when I received my food, but the manager made sure to ignore it. I'm sure he see's it all the time. I wasn't about to make an issue of it, because I don't want to be that friend that sends the food back because it's too small. My friends got real-sized meals though. Good for them. 2 Stars because it was clean and the server was nice."}
{"text":"Delicious meal!  Unicorn Lemonades, Honey Garlic Glazed Ribs were to die for. Top that off with a helpful, friendly server (hi Levi) it was a needed sit down with great food. I usually get a French Dip but I'm so glad I branched out!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Very tasty food, friendly service.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. The management here has no interest in satisfying customers, will never come back here, and will actively tell others to not come back here. I had ordered the salmon, it took a while to come out, and when it did, it was slimy, pink and not cooked. I had asked for a re-heat, 10 minutes later I was informed the kitchen was making a whole new salmon for me and it would be a couple minutes. 10 minutes later asked to see the manager as I had already been waiting 20 minutes for a re-heat and saw 2 salmon dishes come out before mine. The manager didn't say sorry, he acted like nothing was wrong waiting 20 minutes for a re-heat, and that it would be another \"30 seconds\" before it came out. This whole time my partner was left to eat her dish alone. Management did not offer to even refill our empty drinks! We waited another 5 minutes and walked out of the restaurant, we chatted with our server and he said that he understood why we wanted to leave, and the kitchen was \"a mess\" and we didn't have to pay for our bill...Well I didn't get dinner so I didn't expect to pay. 

The management here is a sad excuse."}
{"text":"Verbal assurance from staff that they have Halal Chicken options.  Ordered take out pizza from this location.  Beware that they do serve bacon here, so you need to make sure that you are clear when ordering, as they messed up one of our pizzas (Szechuan) and put bacon on it after we told them we wanted it without it.  But they did correct the order and did not charge us for it.  The BBQ chicken pizza is also good.  Prices are a little on the high side, since it is considered \"gourmet\" pizza. But they had good and friendly service."}
{"text":"I really am not a fan of Boston Pizza. Its not my cup of tea. To each is own I guess. I do like the dessert though, the browny I believe. The service was good though."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, food arrived stone cold. Kind of a drag to have to warm up my food after waiting for 45 minutes and paying a $4.00 delivery charge."}
{"text":"Worst Boston Pizza I have ever gone to!

Ordered the nachos with EXTRA CHEESE..they came with literally a few specs of cheese..all the nachos were dry. 

The server didn't even come back once to ask if we wanted another drink. Sat there for 30 mins while she disappeared. --note we came in at 10pm after the jays game. 

There were 2 females working the bar
1.) short curly hair wearing a red uniform..she was very nice but completely useless where'd you disappear to!?
2.) lil bigger girl dressed in black who brought people their food, I overheard her give the next table over a discount because she's dating the manager BUT DONT TELL BOSTON PIZZA THIS BECAUSE SHE COULD GET IN TROUBLE! 

garbage. I'm glad I left no tip. Didn't deserve a penny."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online....which was 20mins late.
Food was meh and ended up getting sick the next 2 days....."}
{"text":"Raised the prices, for there small pizzas from 6.99 to 10.99. Okay pizza I paid extra for pepperoni but they only added 4 little pieces of pepperoni. Big plus there open late"}
{"text":"Service is good food was so so. Sent back cold calamari.  French onion not great.  I liked the pizza sliders. Quesadillas were not that good."}
{"text":"This place is always great. It's a reliable choice after a day of shopping in the mall. The food is pretty consistent, it tastes good and you always know what you'll get in terms of quality and taste. Service here is also always very friendly and attentive. They also have a bar side, which is nice if you want to get away from children. Wish they had a patio though."}
{"text":"Nice busy place, food was good. 

However the waitress that we had was not very attentive to a point where she came across as rude.

Even though i only left her 15% tip but did not feel good about that and actually wanted to leave her 5%.

TIP: if you are going to this place late at night then be careful cops are stopping cars at will."}
{"text":"Terrible! Cold food. Loud. Bad service. Honestly I don't expect much from a Boston Pizza but this is just unacceptable. Too bad there isn't much choice in Chestermere. Also, stop letting people smoke right outside the door, staff included."}
{"text":"First off, reading these reviews, take them for seriousness with a grain of salt. Comparing Boston with Pizza Hut? Reviews from Coneheads from the planet Kolob, is more like it. And customer service? These people don't try to kiss your ass, they know they have great pizza, you want it or not, and I am fine with that, I don't like ass kissers. The pizza is great, lots a cheese, lotsa toppings, great crust, decent delivery, and an offer you can't refuse on Tuesdays, 2 for 1. Two thumbs up for Boston Pizza. The rest of you can go get a chain store pizza."}
{"text":"I've been to many Boston Pizza's over the years, and I can say that this particular location has the worst service by far.  We live super close so it's an easy option for a meal, but almost every time we've been there we've had issues whether it be bacon in my vegetarian pasta, out of the options we wanted to order, and poor service.  Tonight was no exception.  We arrived, were seated, and brought drinks quickly, but then waited AN HOUR to receive our pasta.  Maybe they were growing the grain to make the pasta??  After it finally arrived the food was hot and tasted good, but the service was just so excruciatingly slow.  Our waitress apologized for the delay and said that she had forgotten to put our order into the system.  Kind of an important part of the job I'm afraid.  While we were there we also saw 2 others leave after waiting for their meals, someone return their pizza, and 2 others return their food because it was cold by the time they got it.  So all in all, not a good experience and I definitely wouldn't plan to go to this location, particularly if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Went into the BP on a Wednesday and this place is one of the larger BPs I've ever been in.  Main floor is about the size of what I think most BPs are.... not to mention they have a whole second floor that is equally as large.

As mentioned earlier came in on a Wednesday, and granted there was was a large convention in town and this place is almost right across the street from the convention centre.  You'd think that they would be accustomed to handling the lunch rush.  That would be incorrect.

The host who sat us had trouble figuring out where to put us.  Granted we were a group of 7, but again... across from the convention centre, should be accustomed to this type of traffic... anyways.  We were seated on the second level and right away we could tell there was some issues.  Our server took an exceptionally long time to get over to our table.  Once we finally got our server he took our drink order.  10 minutes later, some of us had drinks, others did not.  We had to flag down some of the other servers going by to get our drinks.  

We had discussed going across the street to a different place, but we were all hungry and decided to just stick it out... that was probably a mistake.  We ordered our food, and just like our drinks, some of us got our food and 10-15 mins later some more food rolled out.  It was abysmal.  I am willing to overlook some of the service issues if the food is decent.  This BP falls short of all the other BPs that I've been to.  The brute I ordered was not hot, but warm, it was small compared to the others BP places I've been to, and there were approx 24 fries on the plate.  The others in the group were not impressed with their food or the portion size.  

Overall, the service was very poor, the quality of the food was below average.  The only plus I can say about this place, they had plenty of TVs and it was nicely designed.  But typically that isn't why I go to a place.  I will not be going back to this one.  There are other places in the neighborhood... my suggestion would be to go to those places.  I wish we did !"}
{"text":"I had a raspberry virgin mojito, spinach and artichoke dip and a vegetarian pizza. Lovedddd the dip which is served with pizza bread and they serve a generous portion. We had a medium sized veggie pizza which was good. To finish it off we had a chocolate brownie explosion which was such a decadent treat served with ice cream! I was so stuffed at this point that I couldn't finish the dessert. Overall we were happy with the service. 

We sad on the bar side but there is a family side as well. Definitely planning to go back."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but Boston Pizza has become a 2-star experience at best...

Every time I call to place an order for pick-up late at night, I'm put on hold for several minutes. Once I finally get through, the person on the other end is very short & quick with me, as if I'm a bother... On top of rarely being able to repeat my simple order back to me correctly.

The last time I called in, I placed my order and was told it'd be 25-30 min. until it'd be ready - which is fine - but once it was time to pick up, they hadn't even started to make my food... Nor did they even know my order to begin with!

Yeah, it's still somewhat tasty pizza, but it's very disappointing to see a neighborhood favorite become so subpar."}
{"text":"People typically go to a chain because they know what they can expect with the food and ambiance. Whether you're going to Boston Pizza in Oakville or Boston Pizza in Etobicoke, you'd think the experience would be relatively the same. This wasn't the case last night when I went for dinner with a friend. We entered to a quiet restaurant with only a few people around and no one to greet us. We stood there for a while before someone even noticed we were there. When we ordered cactus cut chips they were burnt. Waitress didn't refill my empty glass of water during the meal. Did I mention the restaurant was practically empty? When it was time to get the bill, it was wrong. She left and returned with another bill that wasn't ours. Definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"Holy!!! I wasn't expecting this Boston Pizza (BPs) to be reviewed as harshly as it has been! That's not to say that those comments/reviews aren't just, I'm just surprised because I've been here quite a few times and it's never been that bad for me personally. If it were that bad I wouldn't keep coming back; once a place has scorned me bad they usually lose me as a customer for good. So what do I think??? I think it's an average restaurant. Do they always do things 100% right? Nope... Will you get amazing service? Probably not... But most of the time you will get a decent meal at a good price, that's usually the expectation BPs sets for me and that's usually what I get. 

The Chinook Centre location has some advantages and disadvantages being located in the mall. Chinook Centre is easy to get to so I'd say it's pretty conveniently located, also being right in the mall it's a good option for people who are shopping or to combine with a movie outing. Despite being at a very busy mall, this location usually isn't overly busy, even at peak evening and lunch hours the wait is usual minimal and most of the time you get right in. Being at a busy mall can also be drawback for parking though; this BPs is located on the west end next to Nordstrom which is one of the busier parking lots now. Back when this was a Sears parking area it was no issue, but since Nordstrom set-up shop it's been a different story.

For food, BPs can be pretty hit and miss. They have a large menu that is constantly changing and offers seasonal choices. There's even a new \"Glutenwise\" section in their menu. The problem is not their lack of categories or choices, they actually have so much that it can be a bit overwhelming and hard to choose something, but an even bigger problem than that for me is their lack on consistency. Some items are great and some are just disappointing. For example, their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is a pretty good and classic choice that is usually satisfactory, but their newer Pizzaburger despite sounding delicious is actually quite disappointing. This is the trend that carries throughout their whole menu, some things are good-great, some are okay to just plain bad... As others mentioned, they're constantly getting rid of stuff too and a lot of the time it's not the bad items, it's actually one's they were doing a good job at! *face palm* Their drink menu is completely average as well, it has all the basics and is completely adequate but offers nothing special as a value proposition. 

I've had some awesome service at other BPs locations, but the Chinook location is usually average at best. Part of this isn't their fault as I've found they're typically understaffed (more so in the lounge), which translates to longer wait times for everyone. Unfortunately I've also noticed that the managers don't help out enough in these situations which is a pretty poor show of talent/qualifications. Real restaurant managers are constantly busy on the floor, they run food, introduce themselves and checkup on customers. This is not just the server's job! On our most recent visit we ordered wings, which actually came out before napkins and wet naps. Standard practice would be to bring these out ahead of time as well as plates (which we did not get). She also forgot to bring out the ranch but didn't forget to charge it; we of course brought this to her attention and she reversed it. Other than that she was quick with everything else and did a good job checking up on us, so as expected it was average service overall. 

Everything considered, it was an average experience as expected. The food was good, the price was right and the service was average. I suggest to tread carefully when navigating the menu; in my experience it's usually better to go with the tried and true over something new and different when eating at BPs. But also no risk, no reward! That new item could be your new go-to lol... So on second thought I'll leave that up to you ;-). Good luck!"}
{"text":"My first time trying their famous \"Pizzaburger\". I was impressed! 
It wasn't too greasy, a good combination of burger and a cheese pizza. I was full.
Our associates ordered pasta and pizza, we were all satisfied. The pasta portions were huge. I just wish they gave me more fries though.
Their desserts were a perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Finally, a local bar that embraces boxing and not only UFC. 

Was thrilled to see a boxing poster actually hanging on the wall and being promoted.  A sport nobody in the GTA seems to care about anymore. 

THANK YOU Boston Pizza Meadowvale !"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how much I love Boston Pizza.  It's hands-down one of the best chain restaurants ever.

Their menu is very extensive, and I have enjoyed everything I have had at Boston Pizza.  They have the best pizza dough, and a combination of traditional and more exotic pizzas.

The service is always friendly, and fast - even if you only have a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"BP food seems to depend on the location. This one is just your average pub food, nothing special , but not terrible either.

However, beware the overly keen jobsworth waitress in the bar area, its the miserable one with short hair and sleeve tattoos. Was with a date, and she cut her off on drinks early on in the evening, and she must have had only  4 g+t's. She wasn't even remotely drunk, I was the designated driver so no risk to anyone.

Way to go, party pooper. I think the server was just in a bad mood so took it out on us."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken wings and they were definitely not as good as the ones I've tried in other BP's. The portion was small and not very tasty.
However, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"The new Boston Pizza on Young and Empress near North York Center. The inside looks cool, with lots of TVs to watch while waiting for the order to come. The orders was slow to come, however it was really fresh and a delight for your taste buds. The Pepperoni bacon pizza burger was really tasty."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars but the pizza at night is far better then the pizza during the daytime. But other than that all around good food good Wings good fingers what you expected of a pizza joint"}
{"text":"Called today make a order as they have delivered to our location before and the guy on the phone was so fast to say.  No we don't deliver have a nice day.  Crazy the rudeness of people.   Sad thing is I 2as ordering for a entire company and we'll not any longer.  Never again.  Rude people terrible customer service.  When I asked if I was bothering him he said nope just busy have a nice day.   

If you don't want good service call this place and be treated like crap.   My money is and was accepted elsewhere."}
{"text":"Walked in around 2:30pm. Waited about 5 minutes just to be seated. Once sat I waited almost 15 minutes and no one had still even come by to take a drink order. Decided to leave and as soon as I stood up a waitress came running over. Told her she was too late and I left. Won't be back there anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"We were served immediately! I believe my waiter's name was Lana. She was so sweet and was able to answer all my questions. I tend to be really picky with big franchises, so they really hit my standards!'

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and my server was really friendly. I got medium fried wings with garlic toast. I personally thought the toast was going to be much warmer than it was when I got it but it wasn't too bad. I understand it was really busy but I really do wish the server had checked up to see if I needed anything more often as I did find myself waiting a lot.

P.s  Why do they call them waiters if we're the ones waiting?"}
{"text":"Been eating here occasionally for a few years now, wings have always been fantastic but as of the last time we went it seem like they changed the pizza dough. I was not a fan, dough was very dense and dry and super thick. The cheese sauce and toppings were all fantastic as usual. Not sure that I'll go back, for pizza at least."}
{"text":"This is a huge location, its like 8 floors! But there's elevators. Went all the way to the top floor, where there is a bar with many flat screen TVs with HD feeds. A party room. Many tables and lots of seating. Surprised they could fit so much in this building. Great looking place with a glass ceiling so lots of natural light. Would be a great place to have a beer and watch the game and have some nibbles.

The food though... tried the pizza of the day for lunch, which was a tropical pizza... it was all bread, not much cheese or tomato sauce or toppings. Basically mostly bread. It is only $10 but a small portion, 8 inches. I probably would only come here to grab a beer and watch the game not for the food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Have tried many different items off their extensive menu and have NEVER had a bad meal and all the staff are friendly. Pizza's are cheesy and the wings and fingers are the best, not to mention the homemade ranch. I drive all the way from the northwest just to get wings. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night after volleyball. I think everyone else came here too so the place was packed. They were extremely understaffed that night and the waiter was stressed out. He did not hide it well. Food took forever to come. I ordered a seafood pasta. It was hard to chew."}
{"text":"I remember back in the good old days working on the high school yearbook on a Saturday.... Our teacher would bring in Einstein's/donuts for brekkies and once in a while order Boston Pizza for lunch. I wish I remembered the exact pizzas she ordered but damn were they good. I've since been to the actual establishment a couple times, and the pizza is always top-notch. I don't even know what makes a Boston pizza. But I lived in Boston for four years and never had pizza this good."}
{"text":"They have the absolute worst customer service! My work has ordered over 20 times & every time is the same way. I just tried to place my order for lunch today & the man on the phone started yelling at me. That is not how you do business. Time before this, they got our order wrong & it took another 45 minutes to get it & we couldn't eat cause we missed lunch. NEVER again will we order food here again! Worst experience EVER! Don't waste your money! Broadway is wayyy better! 702-259-9002"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a sporting event especially UFC nights.  Never had a problem getting seats.  I usually get the medium rare 8oz steak sandwich $16.99 which is often inconsistent but still tastes good.  I've tried other items and its hit or miss.  Also I like that they give free refills for pop.  I was with a group of 6 recently and they charged us 18% auto gratuities which didn't happen in the past.  Might be a new policy."}
{"text":"Came here around 11:15 for a few beers with my friends for my bday and the sign says they close at 1. Caitlyn said they are closing 15 earlier today after we already order a dessert and a round of drinks.. my 2 othrr friends were on their way and they refused to serve us a team pitcher for our last call drink... is that possible? I asked why there was no sign outside and she said \"for 15 minutes really?\"... I then asked her what her name was to reassure and she said \"MaryAnn\".. she said she can order our drinks for us but WE HAVE TO be out by 1245. 
Wow talk about customer server at its worst. I am a bartender too and I can smell bad customer treatment a mile away. My advise: go early, they won't kick you out!"}
{"text":"Utensils not received until much later; water refilled only once, UFC fight froze; co-diners wanted more attention; but on the plus side, the thin crust pizza was awesome...so overall an ok review. More mints were provided upon request :)"}
{"text":"Boston Pizza on 130th Ave in South Trail Crossing in Calgary deep SE has been here for well over 10 Plus Years. 

Staff are super friendly and menu has great variety to pick from pizza to apps to burgers and of course pasta. 

Large dining area and large bar lounge area (two levels) with lots of TV with sports. 

Pricing always good and food consistently hot and fresh. 

Love the classic pepperoni pizza. Kids meals are price nice with drink and desert. 

The chocolate explosion is incredible sweet and is large enough for 2-3 adults. 

Overall it's Boston Pizza and can't go wrong with this choice. Apple Pay works which is nice!"}
{"text":"Boston Pizza has evolved over the years for the better. 

This location is a good size and has a bar section too. 

Menu is large and pricing is good. Pizza is my choice here and really enjoy their pepperoni  

Staff is very friendly and quick. 

Food has been hit and miss here but improving. 

Value is great for families and recommend it for anyone that enjoys this restaurant franchise."}
{"text":"Première visite et nous sommes allé avec Alfredo et Kandi du côté bar. Dés écrans partout à différents canaux de sports. Bon choix de bières et aussi de vins au verre. Le service fut rapide,amical et professionnel par la mère Noël. Belle ambiance de bar. Stationnement très facile."}
{"text":"Came here last night for date night! This is one of our usual spots for a quick dinner out and write have always loved the Perogie Pizza! Staff is always super friendly and great with recommendations! They recently updated the menu and have a few things I'm curious about trying and might have to withhold from getting the pizza next time!

My rating for a 4 star on this visit was it was a UFC night, my boyfriend and I showed up wayyy in advance not wanting to stay for the game. The bar was empty but they tried to make us sit at a tiny table instead of the booths when other couples had taken the other booths already saying they would be very busy in a few hours so we couldn't take the booth. Instead we decided to go into the dining room so we could have a comfy seat and the TV they put us in front of was broken... By the time we left the bar still wasnt full for the game. Have had much better experiences at this location but last night wasn't one of them."}
{"text":"Most disappointing visit here and imagine I hadn't even eaten any food. It's a Saturday night and just wanted to watch the soccer game and eat some pasta. But ended up walking out. First off the hostess did not even greet me, secondly I walked into the bar area and sat down, there were three servers in the bar area and not one even acknowledged me. I waited 5 mins to see if anyone would come and greet me. No one came so I walked out. End of story. I expect more from a Canadian establishment. I ended up going to Buffalo Wild Wings and was greeted by the hostess who asked how I was doing. The place was busy, more than I can say for Boston Pizza. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise.  I gave this location a 2nd chance after my first visit was a unmitigated disaster about a year ago.  I was near the airport and realized it was 'Pasta Tuesday'.

Service was excellent.  Refills of my Diet Pepsi came quickly.  I had the Jambalaya Fettuccine.  Which was quite good.  Not spectacular but good.  Huge portion.  I didn't bother with the garlic toast.  Manager came by to ask how we liked our dinner.  Talked to him for a minute and apparently they cleaned house with their management team.  The improvement is noticeable. 

Good service.....1 star
Good atmosphere.....1 star
Clean.....1 star
Good but not spectacular food.....1 star.

For $11 a plate, on Tuesday's, it's quite reasonable as well."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience!  The only positive is that 4 of us were seated right away. It took 10 minutes before our server acknowledged our existence.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  It was at that point we realized there was only a single waitress on the Restaurant side with exactly 9 tables at the time.  We placed our food order after the drinks were served.  The waitress did not write down our orders....I'm never impressed by this practice.  The food arrived....I ordered the Jambalaya Fettucine...but with the whole wheat linguine instead.  No whole wheat linguine and the food could be best described as warm.  The fact was 3 of the 4 orders were incorrect.   I took forever to get a pop re-fill.  No parmesan cheese ever came.  I walked over to the service station and picked it up myself.  Sorry but 3 out of 4 unsatisfied customers doesn't cut it.

I had a much better experience at the  Oakville location off Trafalgar about 2 weeks earlier."}
{"text":"This is the only BP open today for Christmas so we came to try at this location. The service was very good. The steak was ok. The spaghetti was ok. The salmon salad wasn't good because the salmon was so dry. The nacho wasn't that good either. The sour cream was hot when it came so we had to change it. I would rather go to a different BP of I had a choice."}
{"text":"This is definitely a 2 1/2 star restaurant. The food isn't good. There wasn't enough sauce for the salad. Everything seems so not attractive. My sons birthday and they took our cake out Nd didn't even sing happy birthday for us. The waitress had a smile and nice and that was the only thing was good. The service is very slow too. It's hard to find anyone at first. I won't come here again."}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza is located on Major Mac, in between woodbine and the 404 in the Shoppers Plaza. I hadn't seen my little brother in a long time and he wanted to go to Boston pizza. There is a bunch of parking, you won't even have to worry about that. The patio wasn't open, as it's still too cold but they do have a patio. My brother had a coupon for a free pizza. I had the MVP burger, the pizza looked great but I guess any free pizza is awesome.

The MVP burger was below par.. I mean it tasted okay but for the amount it cost (similar to other chain restaurants, like Joeys, or Milestones, etc.) service was amazing, the girl even refilled drinks without asking, I like that she was attentive but then again, it wasn't packed either. They kinda skimmed me on the sweet potato fries... but eh -- the lunch was for my brother.

All in all, I'd rate it close to the same previous review. At 2.5/5. The only difference was seeing my baby brother, that was the best part.

Wouldn't recommend to a friend unless you're really hungry."}
{"text":"3 stars not for food but the charming waitress who earned nothing but my utmost respect. The food was worse than my own cooking and I barely finished anything. Just an overall awkward experience...good service: subpar food. I wasn't expecting gods own apples but something that tastes better than Tim Hortons grilled cheese would've been nice. It's like they're stuck in a weird spot between pizza joint and sports bar. Pick one and be good at it. And those mints after the meal aren't that effective...unfortunately."}
{"text":"I have been to Boston Pizza many many times all over the gta, but I would have to say that this time wasn't great. The server was okay, except we waited around 15 min for her to come. Once we got our orders (which took over 35 min) my spoon was like someone just finished eating from it, and my friends cider had a fruit fly in it, as well as she also had dirty utensils and napkins as well! The meal for me was good I had the onion soup and the \"Big Dipper\" which is a steak sandwich with peppers and fried onions on top. 
My husband had the veggie nachos since his cactus cut nachos suddenly ran out. We asked for extra cheese, which we got, but it wasn't melted very well and the chips were changed to these new lime seasoned chips-which were not the greatest. 
I don't think I will come back to this location."}
{"text":"-Slow service (I think they were catering to phone calls first, there was only 3 people in the establishment and it took 40 mi
-Super busyyyyyy (inside & phone calls)
-Lots of indoor seating
-Awesome wings
-Pizza is a-ok. I've had a lot better.. super doughy & super greasy - be prepared with napkins
-Customer service is whatever, definitely nothing special.
-Lots of parking
-They seem to have a lot of regulars since it got busy after we got our food... seemed like a hole-in-the-wall, family, local kinda spot.

We were in town getting my car fixed and was craving pizza. I probably won't be back here since I'm not from the area, but it satisfied the pizza craving."}
{"text":"Amazing! Not sure who rated this place so terribly, but the service was great. From the start of the order to the delivery at my door was 20 mins. The delivery person was courteous and kind. The food was hot and tasty and my kids loved it. Had a nice healthy option for my kids, which is nice to see. Great experience"}
{"text":"Erik needs to leave. Took 15 minutes to do anything we requested and the restaurant was in no way busy. He was rude, and slow. Food and drinks were fine by our experience was straight up ruined by our server. Probably will not come back."}
{"text":"Pasta Tuesday. My wife likes it, but it is just not my cup of tea. The food has the feel of something that has been prepared earlier and warmed up to order. The chicken was clearly frozen and possibly prepackaged. The sauces have this prepared taste to them, and other than quantity for price, it doesn't have much else going for it. Generally I am not a fan of pasta, but overall the food is ok.
This is a restaurant that needs a new identity. It's not quite a sports bar, not quite a family restaurant."}
{"text":"2.7**
This is a dependable place to grab a decent bite to eat. It has a large bar area and tv screens are located around the restaurant to watch sports. The service is OK, but sometimes the waitresses get a little busy and forget you for a while. 

The food is OK definitely nothing to write home about. The pizzas and pastas are overpriced. The spinach salad is good and so are the burgers. That's about it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch meeting with a colleague.

I wish I never did. 

Service was great at first but then started to get super freakin' annoying... We were there for an hour and in that hour we got interrupted by the waiter and manager 16 times. I actually counted... I didn't need a step by step update every time you passed us. I couldn't get a sentence in or to talk about work with out getting bombarded by the waiter. 

Finally after he went back and forth from the computer and reviewed our order 4 times... about 20 mins passed and we got our food... I had the chicken cobb salad...I found a piece of hair.. okayy... I'm not going to make a scene, quietly flagged down the manager and told him the issue, took it back and it took 25 mins for a new salad to come back... we asked once in the number of interruptions we got if the salad was ever going to come and we just got brushed off. I had to finish it in literally 5 mins in order to get back to the office. It was taken off the bill which I appreciate but please please work on time, staff management for this location- it's lacking it BIG BIG BIG TIME"}
{"text":"I like Boston Pizza.. perhaps this was an irregularity but it literally took 45 minutes for a pizza and wings to come out.."}

{"text":"After our favorite nearby pizza joint closed down we were on the hunt for a place that is open late, has decent prices, but most importantly good pizza. Boston Pizza totally fits the bill. Glad we found this place. Their fried mushrooms and ranch are also great and they have anchovies (eewwah...haha) which the husband loves."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the bartender was very nice and welcoming. The Caesar was very good. Ordered the French onion soup. It was horrible. After ordering the soup I knew I didn't want to order anything else. The service was good and the bartender was very nice, but the food was not something I would go there for. The drinks are probably the best thing about this place."}
{"text":"restaurant empty yet they placed us closest to the kitchen door where we could hear pots and pans being thrown around we asked to be moved from the getgo yet they said they had the other areas reserved, we did not see anyone coming in while we were there so we decided to have one drink only and we cancelled the food orders cuz we were mad and took our business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Sadly the food has gone downhill! I Ordered the pizza burger and it was bland, overcooked and soggy greasy mess. Also tried the meateater pizza and it was horrible. Barely any cheese no sauce, undercooked oily greasy mess. Drinks and service were good no complaints there but bp get your act together"}
{"text":"horrible horrible food wayy to salty and i had the steak sandwhich . i asked for well done and i got a piece of charcoal that was  overly salty.. how can anyone not know how to cook some meat??:((( i am still feeling sick this morning with the worst stomach ache ever. if we weren't in a rush i would've sent that piece of garbage away and left to have better food at subway instead...  we asked for the food and bills and paid at one single stop cuz  we saw how slow she was to even bring our food and drinks... i looove boston pizza usually but this location is super slow the waitress was lousy and never again will i go to this location...  i overheard two other tables send their food back for being ridiculously salty and nasty so obviously the cook is prolly the dishwasher too..."}
{"text":"I took my family, and the in-laws for late lunch, we got seated fast, service started off well, and then, we ordered our lunch, which we all knew what we wanted. Once the lunch arrived, it was good, But the service went down hill, after a long wait for the waitress, I had to go towards the kitchen and get chili flakes, then we did not see our server for the longest time, so once again I had to go ask for refills, then another long wait, this is ridiculous and not acceptable,,the waitress had a great attitude but no follow through, I love my BPs, but lately all of them the service has gotten bad, hopefully someone from BPs reviews these, and does some changes, I'm very disappointed. Especially when the Food was good!"}
{"text":"yep.  one star.   we went on a sunday, around 5 pm.  the service was absolutely the worst i have ever seen in a restaurant.  it was not busy and we had no one to greet us or showing us a table.  we waited for 5 minutes before someone showed up.  the waitress took forever to show up and take our order.  i am never ever coming back to this particular boston pizza franchise.  can you imagine when this place is busy?  i dread the thought."}
{"text":"May 11, 2018 - My friend loves to go to Boston Pizza, he got The MVB and I ordered The Big Dipper. I normally get the Big Dipper when I go, it has become one of my favourites there.

The Big Dipper comes with sliced steak placed on a toasted garlic-brushed bun with melted pizza mozzarella, braised onions, roasted red peppers and crispy onion straws. Served with horseradish mayo and au jus.

Dipping the Big Dipper in the au jus and then the horseradish is so yummy!!

On to my addiction........

Anytime I go to a restaurant that serves alcohol, I always ask for Pina Colada w/ extra cherries! Some places will give me 2-3 extra cherries, but today I asked for extra cherries and our server gave me a cup of cherries!

When I ordered my second Pina Colada I forgot to ask for more cherries, but she brought a new cup with cherries again!! 

The server did a wonderful job!! I really liked that even though she was busy serving others she still remembered my order."}
{"text":"May 22, 2018 - we ordered jambalaya pasta, it was very good. It had a lot of meat and the garlic bread was so soft and tasted very good with the pasta. 

I'm a bit sad cause this location doesn't serve \"Pina Colada\", so I ordered the unicorn lemonade. It was okay, just wish I had my favourite drink.

Either than that the service was good and the overall atmosphere there was good too. My friend likes this location more than the others, but I find that I like the other locations more."}
{"text":"Life. Death. Universe. What does it all mean? Why are we here? What's on the ceiling? I couldn't help but wonder what in gods name was on the hostesses mind as she walked around looking up not giving a shit about her job. Our poor waitress was running around on her own while our dirty plates sat on our table as dessert arrived. 

I mean, pizza is delicious. The food was great. But this establishment couldn't handle the buzz of Friday night and it's 6 patrons that came with it."}
{"text":"Nasty bland food and shit service.
Most shit service ever.
This is the worst place I have eat at."}
{"text":"This review may be slightly bias only because we came when they had ANY individual pizza for $5. This is to celebrate their 10th anniversary. I wonder how they made money off that. 
They're normally about $9-13 for the individual pizza so this was an amazing deal if you ask me! You would think because it's the 10th anniversary, it would be $10, but some of the pizzas cost less than $10... or they could've upped the size to $10 for any small/medium/large har har! Unfortunately, only August 10th... maybe the next big anniversary! 

Side note: The schezhuan pizza did not have an individual size. 

It wasn't crowded when we went in, mind you that we did go into the restaurant as soon as it opened at 11am. We had a lovely waitress for our table of 5. Service did take a while just for pizza to be honest but it wasn't a big deal. They serve Starbucks coffee for those who are interested. Fyi, the coffee was $3, and we thought it was funny how the coffee cost just as much as the pizza. 

Overall, great experience - and my dad was definitely pleased with the price we paid!!

Be warn, they're not going to tell you it's $5 individual pizza - you have to ask and look for the minimum advertisement they have done on the restaurant. We saw a table of 2 and my dad was suspecting their meal probably cost more and we had a table of 5. 





I do have to say the FIRST time I came, I didn't have the best experience as our waitress (Again, don't remember the name) was definitely not considerate with my cousin about her dietary concerns and seemed impatient when she was trying to order from the menu. I'm just happy we had a better experience the next time we came around."}
{"text":"There are certain employees who understand how to do their jobs in the service industry and some who really do not. My party decided to leave Dave and Busters and go to Boston Pizza because Dave and Busters was the worst place to get service. Anyways we walked into Boston Pizza where we were greeted and seated by the hostess. Only issue was she forgot to give this party of 10 any menus. :s I once worked at a Boston Pizza, so I thought to myself I can just relive my past and grab my own menus. I got a couple and handed them to my friends and greeted them \"Hi my name is Jimmy, I will be your server tonight! Can I start anyone off with anything to drink?\" This was probably the best service they were going to receive all night. It seemed that way when our actual waitress was unable to take down our drink orders and forgot many of our drinks. We all were quite unimpressed, until a guy named Derek stepped in and helped/took over. He was a great server. Took down our food orders accurately and remembered who had what when the staff brought out the food. He was quite friendly and charismatic. He took our picture for the end of the night and jokingly took a selfie of himself to top it off. He definitely offset the rest of the bad service. Way to represent Boston Pizza Derek! Until next time, Jimstar out!!"}
{"text":"Poor rendition of what Canadians think American food is supposed to taste like.

I guess this is payback for all of the maple syrup and Canadian bacon stereotypes, eh?"}
{"text":"I asked for a pasta with veggie burger as the meat substitute and she said it back to me then gave me a beef burger inside I took a bite and was sick!! If that was an allergy I would be dead! Not coming back. Plus her service was very cold.."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is awesome. They have a very large menu, and I'd say there is something for everyone on here. The service is good too. On occasion you'll get coupons for the next time you go. It's a good restaurants for birthday parties too. Good place overall."}
{"text":"Pretty standard experience here. Its BP's so you pretty much know what to expect. 

On this trip I tried a few new things. They have a decent cocktail selection so you can get something a little off the beaten path. Their sticky ribs were ok. The pizza was good but could probably use more cheese. 

The service was meh, just like every other location."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes and got ignored completely. We had to wave down someone to serve us. Never ever happened to me before. The place wasn't even full. It was 60% empty. had servers completely walk past us with our menus out.

Garbage."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre for the price but given its a franchise restaurant I wasn't going to be picky about the food.

The service was not very good as there was an approximate 10 minute gap between receiving my food and my girlfriend receiving her food.

When she received her dish, the food was already cold.

Asking the waitress for napkins or silverware also took a long time."}
{"text":"ive been coming here since a little kid and my opinion is BEST PIZZA in LAS VEGAS !!!! owner n staff are very friendly and all there food is great so if your ever near the downtown area i REALLY suggest you check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a little birthday lunch on a Sunday afternoon. 

We were not greeted by the host as he was on the phone. 

We sat down and waited....and waited....

Ten minutes later still waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence in the patio. 
Or to at least greet us and give us a menu. 

Well we got tired of waiting and had to go back in and hunt someone down. 

The person who we found, was off standish and said someone will be with you. 

Well we continued to wait another 5 minutes before a young guy finally came to our table. 

Luckily he was very friendly but still the service there, or lack of service was very slow and the communication between them all seemed ineffective as they all pointed to another when asked for our server. 

Food was fine and the patio was nice but if your hungry and want service then maybe go somewhere else.  otherwise you will starve or get hangry. 

On another note I did receive my bday dessert which was nice."}
{"text":"Waited for 45 minutes for my order.  No food.   Was assured it would be out in 10 minutes.  After 15 more minutes I had to leave.   Don't expect anything quickly."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars

Came here for the pasta on a Tuesday, which is the special. It used to be $10.99 but it seems to have gone up to $11.99 with the menu update. I used to come to this location all the time for the Schooner special and cactus cut potatoes to watch Raptor games. The last couple times, I feel like the service has been getting a bit slower, and hard to flag down a server. Anyways ordered the Jambalaya Fettuccine with a side Caesar.

Food-wise, I still think the pasta (on Tuesdays) is a great deal. You get a good amount of pretty tasty food. The jambalaya fettuccine has chicken, shrimp and has a little bit of spice. The Tuesday special price, even though increased is good for what you get. Will probably still come back every once in a while, but I felt like this place used to be better."}
{"text":"Place is like a Friday's restaurant. Pizza was mediocre, sauce too sweat. Service was fine. Expensive."}
{"text":"I took the cactus cut- am not sure if it was supposed to be crispy or not. But they were really floppy and not crispy at all. Got 2 cuts crispy which was really good but the others was just like eating sponges. The chicken wings we took was really great, tasty.
Pizza was full of big raw onions- taste of the pizza was good though."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Never going back. We have been here quite a few times for late night drinks and snacks, but this was the last time! 
Just went in for a drink with the wife. They were fairly busy, and it seemed like there was only one bartender on. This was a Saturday night. We found a booth and waited about 7 mins for no service. I had to go to the bar to order my beer and a caesar (which as usual, didn't have any of the special garnishes it should) for the wife. We got the drinks shortly after that. Talked and enjoyed my drink for the next 10 mins. 
Finished my drink and chatted for about another 10 mins. I was about ready for another beer and at this point, looked over and noticed the bartender settling up with some customers. Luckily I caught eye contact with the bartender in the red football jersey with the name \"Montana\" on the back. Held my empty glass up and nodded to her, in hopes of getting another drink before last call. It was 1:34. 
After that I didn't get my beer and there was no contact at all for the next 5 minutes until my wife stopped one of the servers. She asked for my beer and the server looked confused and said she didn't know - that she was done her tables (we were clearly not one of her tables). She talked to the bartender and then came back and said they can't serve anymore alcohol because its after last call and that they are not allowed to tell people that it's last call. She said we had already asked for our bill, anyways! At no point did we ever talk to anybody to ask for our bill!!! 
So now our original bartender came to our table and asked if everything was good and if we were ready for our bill. I asked if I could get another beer and she said we already called last call. We are not allowed to announce that we called last call (but why?!!). After more attitude she said she would see what she could do.  
She went back to the bar after about 3 min of waiting, we decided that it wasn't even worth it and we definitely wouldn't be back. 
I went back to the bar to settle up and asked the bartender if people normally have to order from the bartender when sitting at one of the booths. She said no, its just a busy night. 
In conclusion, I will not come back to this Boston pizza because of the attitude and unprofessionalism of the staff and a clear lack of teamwork to top it off."}
{"text":"Je m'attendais a tellement plus, jai pris la Pizza, ma femme pates au chsmpignon. Presque pas de sauce, sec raide. Pizza brn ordinaire. First time, last time."}
{"text":"Came in with my 13 family members - everyone received their food eating away... As my daughter & myself sat here in hunger because our server forgot to put in our order. Server came and apologized 30 minutes later mentioning the kitchen forgot to prepare the order. Lies. You didn't punch it in. Would not recommend coming here with a big fan as they seem to get confused. My family is now starting at us eating & ps it was empty in here. Oh & p.s.s we had to go to the kitchen to address the situation."}
{"text":"We had supper there on Saturday evening.  The seafood linguine & spicy Italian penne were really, really fresh & tasty.   It's nice to find pasta that actually has a taste to it.  So many restaurants specialize in bland! 
Serving size was generous enough that I was able to bring home a small doggy bag.  Starter Greek salad was large enough for 2 of us.  Their pizza is delicious!
Surprisingly good wine selection by the glass. 
We arrived at around 8 pm & the bar area looked full, but the dining room had lots of seats.  I wish I could remember our waitress' name because she was terrific.  Very personable, knowledgeable, attentive + a really nice personality.   
I have been to this Boston Pizza several times & have always been pleased with their food and service.  Always clean, including the bathroom."}
{"text":"Service was good. The meal was great.  We sat at the patio as we had a motorized scooter. Would definitely be back.
I highly recommend the chicken pecan salad. It was awesome and quite filling."}
{"text":"50 minute delivery sweet. Order arrived correct sweet. Sauce spilled in bag everywhere, not sweet. Pizza toppings all tossed in the middle. Half my pizza has no toppings just cheese. Serious? Fries soggy as hell serious? Driver disappeared right after cash gone. Never restated order , confirming nothing. Give me money gone. No have a nice night, just in out gone. I appreciate the food from here when done right, but tonight it was done disastrously. We tossed it out and hit 7-11."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to grab dinner before a movie (Ready Player One).

We got in and Mathieu, the hostess quickly greeted us and excuse himself quickly, to clean a booth for us before seating us down.

Lora, our server was super understandable. She rushed out dinner so we can catch the movie on time. She's amazing and really knows how to sympathize with her guests. She had our bill ready so we could pay while we ate and leave as soon as we were done. Thank god for her understanding.

My boyfriend ordered the Spaghetti and meatballs (Pasta Tuesday) and I ordered the Shrimp Tacos. They were both delicious. The pasta portion size was massive, we had to take half to go."}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  Took forever to be seated, the staff were not at all friendly or interested in providing a good experience, and the food was not good."}
{"text":"Well I decided to stop in for a pint of beer , the bar maid served me . An then never saw her again so I decided it was time to go home . So I left a ten dollar bill under my empty glass . As o was driving away her an the manager came out to tell me that I never paid for my bill . I stopped my truck an walked in with her to show her the 10 dollars on the bar . Not even a apology for her or the manager on duty that evening . I highly doubt I be back here again . Bad customer service an never see them around for the bill ."}
{"text":"i just placed an order here for delivery and they suck.  really need to get it together.  expressed my frustration (not rudely) and they said sorry but there are 2 other people also on hold."}
{"text":"The food is terrible. Ordered for pick up today and it was the biggest regret of my life. The meat on my burger was dense and dry and the lettuce looked old. The pizza was mediocre at best and they forgot the dipping sauce. The pasta barely had any sauce and no salt, so it was just dry and bland. The spinach dip came in a container that was barely 1/4 full. The bread that came with the dip was super salty and hard. Don't bother with this place. You're better off ordering from everywhere but here. Very disappointed as I'd always liked Boston Pizza. To top it off, we ordered because it was my friend's birthday. It is hands down one of the worst meals I've had in a very long time. Do not order from here if you want food and you're hungry. You will wish that you were still hungry."}
{"text":"This location is closed until further notice. I tried to go there on Saturday night and the doors were locked and there was a notice."}
{"text":"On a clear and warm summer nite....choose a table on the outside patio.  It's not much of a view (ie. into the parking lot), but it's enclosed by glasswalls so the sunset is great!  On the patio, you can also be as loud as you want, so groups are great.  No TVs outside though, but that's the compromise.

The food is just OK.  I love their pizza, but it's expensive.  A 2-3 topping large pizza will run you $25.  With tax and tip, you're over $30 easily.  They have lots of specialy pizzas too, but those run $28 for a large, so now you're talking abou $35 for 2 people (before drinks)....which is pretty pricey for pizza, no matter how good it tastes.

Don't bother with their steaks....this is a pizza place afterall.  It's definitely no Keg whe it comes to steak.  So if you want Beer and Good Pizza, this is the place, but if you Beer and Good Pizza at a fair price....I would think twice before going.  It could be one of the most expensive Beer/Pizza meals you'll have.

I guess if you're looking for a local bar that also has a full kitchen, then this is a good compromise.  The patio is a nice touch, so I will return again.  I'll just be prepared to pay 50% more for good pizza....it is what it is."}
{"text":"Seriously folks, Jim Tree Living is just trying to do with pizza what McDonalds did with the burger, this stuff is absolute trash, frozen pre packaged portions that do nothing to help your local Canadian farmers."}
{"text":"I went to Boston Pizza to meet some friends who live in Laval since we wanted to see the Kovalev vs. Ward PPV boxing match and we knew that this place would be showing it.

This Boston Pizza has 2 sections. There is a family/restaurant style side and there is a side which is more of a bar-type setting. We sat at the bar-type area. There was ample parking in front of the Boston Pizza at the time that I showed up for the fight so parking wasn't an issue.

My friends were already in Boston Pizza when I arrived. They had purchased 1 pitcher. One of my friends had shown up a few minutes before me. When the waitress returned, she brought a cup for myself and the person who showed up a few minutes before me. She then brought food for my friends and my friends mentioned that they had already ordered and if I (and my friend who also arrived later) wanted something, I (we) should order as well.

I looked at the menu and the waitress showed up a few minutes later and asked me if I decided what I wanted. I had asked my friend who ordered a pizza what size he got and he mentioned that he got a small size. Since I was hungry, I decided to get the medium. I asked for a medium smoke meat pizza and as I was trying to decide the dough/crust, the waitress informed me that they ran out and all the pizzas are thin crust. I got the thin crust smoke meat pizza and asked her to bring another pitcher. My friend who was late ordered the same type of small pizza that my other friend ordered and was eating. At the same time, I asked her for the WiFi password since this Boston Pizza has free WiFi but it was protected by a password. She mentioned that she would return with the WiFi password.

After a few minutes, she brought my pizza and the pitcher of beer along with my friend's pizza. She poured the pitcher into my cup and my friends' mugs without asking them if they wanted. One of my friends had enough beer but didn't say anything so she filled his mug up as well. She also wrote the WiFi password on a piece of paper when she returned.

For a thin crust pizza, I found that the crust/dough was too soggy. When I picked the slice up from the plate by the end, the center point for roughly half the slices bent and was \"soggy\". I felt that the pizza was okay but could have been better since I wasn't allowed to choose my crust/dough because they ran out of everything except thin crust and also the thin crust that I did have wasn't really as crispy as I normally like.

The ambience of the bar during the fight was good. The sound from the PPV event was loud enough that I could hear the commentators. Also, when we finished our food and drinks, there was no high pressure to have us order more items (our table of 4 had spent probably ~$90). The waitress did pass by once to ask us if we were finished and wanted something else but when we said no, she did not return.

After the fight finished, the waitress passed by our table and asked us whether we wanted separate bills. One of my friends who showed up earlier confirmed that the bills would be separate and he would be paying for 1 pitcher. I mentioned that I would be paying for the other pitcher. My friend who showed up a few minutes before me mentioned that he would pay for the first pitcher so we agreed that the late people would pay for the two pitchers. When the waitress returned, she gave me the wrong bill. I took a look at the bill and did notice that I had the pitcher on it but the pizza indicated on my bill was a small vegetarian style pizza instead of a medium smoke meat pizza. I mentioned this to the people at the table and my friend who was also late took a look at his bill and mentioned that he had my bill. Luckily that bill also had the beer pitcher on it.

The waitress then returned with the portable credit card machine and we each paid for our portion of the meal/drinks.

I would rate this Boston Pizza as 3 stars"}
{"text":"I generally loathe chain restaurants of any kind, however I ended up here for lunch. My expectations were low. I ordered the hale kale Caeser and it was delicious, fresh, flavourful, and plentiful. My 5 year old lunch date ordered the spaghetti and loved It. He was disappointed when the server told him they ran out of Jello - how does that happen at 12:30 on a Tuesday, when the place isn't busy? Restaurant was clean, food was edible, service could have been a little better. Overall though, pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place is been in business for 40 years or more if that's true that's with the cashier said because I just ate a salad with the cheapest little fork if you can even call it that and I've eaten with in my entire life.  Salad was tasty I just wish I could've had a real fork

As far as the pizza goes I ordered a whole pineapple pizza with half pepperoni but I guess that was too difficult for the staff to figure out because it came out half pepperoni half pineapple but you know what that's OK the first piece taste good it was weird as I ate the second and third it's like the cheese got hard or something I was excited to find a new place but this is probably the only time you'll ever see me at Boston pizza there's too many choices in town

No bueno"}
{"text":"Lunch menu = a decent time

Came here for a work gathering and it was a first time at boston pizza for most of the folks.

First impression. It was not busy, it was dark inside, and could've have use some music inside.

The lunch menu was good, lots of choices for a reasonable price. Although, I feel like that the waiters can do a better job on telling a recommendation. Oh well, didn't up sell.

I ended up choosing a cheesy bacon penne style meal. It was quite delicious and I can't deny. Can't go wrong with bacon and cheese. Will order this again, but didn't leave a lasting taste for me to want to go back again.

For future visitors, I must say, can't go wrong with any meal but it is nothing special either. Great place to hang out as they have televisions but will opt out to try another restaurant next time.

One thing that would make the experience better for myself. Would be some fried chicken.

Peace out!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, a great place to chill with friends since the service doesn't make you leave if they felt you stayed too long. I've been to this location several times and it's never really that busy.. reservations aren't needed 'cause they always have empty tabled. Music is a little too loud for my liking, I do like music but would be nice if it was turned down a bit. Would visit again next time I'm in the area and looking for an atmosphere as such."}
{"text":"The service was OK. We got seated upstairs and the server took 2 minutes to address us. And we didn't make up our minds on the food yet..so she went away and then she took a few more minutes before she addressed us again. It really wasn't a special experience going there. She wasn't rude she was nice. I'm assuming she was the bartender cause her shoes were converse and destroyed.
When she billed us, she complimented me and my boyfriend as being a cute couple. We both felt weird...cause during the entire time we were there..she didn't really try to conversate with us until it was time to get billed. We still gave her 15% tip anyways. Not because of the compliment but because I work in a restaurant and know the hell servers go through."}
{"text":"Service here is consistently terrible. Unbelievably slow and understaffed. The server was friendly and apologetic but it didn't make up for the food which  was pretty crummy overall. After a couple of tries definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Great service, love eating here. Good chicken Parmesan but the menu is not very diverse. Love to see more added in future."}
{"text":"This summer, I went to this location twice. The first time I sat at the bar while waiting for my take out order, for about 20 minutes, not the bartender noticed nor a waiter showed up, I left.

Second time I went with my wife, we ordered beer and two salads, one with chicken, the other with steak and two 32oz beers which we thought would last us throughout the meal. We finished the beer, waited, looked at the waitress, she noticed, went to the back then came back to say that the salads will be out shortly. We paid and went somwhere else. It does not take 45 minutes to make two salada.

Boston pizza is a chain, they serve the same menu, the only real difference is the serice. If you like Boston Pizza and don't care if/when you get served, you might not mind this location."}
{"text":"This is actually 2.5 stars and honestly if I could only rate my waitress...maya...it would be a 5.  She was great! My pizza was below mediocre. The veggies were pretty much raw! My appetizer came out 2 minutes before my food. This was my first and last time coming here. But Maya you're great!"}
{"text":"BP...had a mixed crew tonight for a dinner out without waiting for a seat so it was BP. First time at this location and was pleasantly surprised - the interior had been reno'd and was light inside from the large windows wrapped all around the dining room.
For a chain I would have to state that the menu is solid...there is something for everyone. The server, named Joanna, was prompt and genuinely friendly with all at the table. Food arrived as ordered along with being hot and ready to eat.
In chain restaurants, the servers make all the difference as the food is and caters to the masses of taste. Parking was readily available and seating was prompt at the start.
I would return."}
{"text":"Went there few time.... 
The good things are, they stays open till late, good for late night meals. The service is good, ample and convenient parking.

Improvements are needed for food... cheese toasts  and pizzas need more generous amour of cheese. Wings need more sauce. The Cactus Cut Fries are good, gives a spicy burst in the mouth :-)"}
{"text":"Best calzone ever!  I ordered delivery from my work and they were here within reasonable amount of time to slicer deliver this scrumptious pile of deliciousness to me!  Made my day.  I got the Boston special calzone for a reasonable price with a small soda, and it was $13 after delivery charge and tip. It was so yummy! I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery for the first time. Great experience all around. Elaina was super friendly taking my order, and everything arrived hot and tasty in less than 45 minutes. The pepper cheesesteak was awesome, and the hoagie roll was perfectly fresh. This will fast become my go-to delivery option for pizza and Phillies!"}
{"text":"Visited because the restaurant was close to my hotel. Great atmosphere and size, wasn't very crowded for a Friday night. Ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. My waiter gave me a dirty plate that she had to replace. The slices were short, the cheese is weird, and the crust was okay. The pizza wasn't great but for the price and size, I expect better. Felt like I was eating a DiGiorno frozen pizza baked in my oven. Also, ordered the fudge brownie that was good."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from 130th location. Explained to the girl to repeat the order as they always forget something . Pizza came all messed up and side ways and so soggy we had to bake it and of course they forgot our dips ! So over this place ."}
{"text":"I never had Boston Pizza before so when I realized I had $20 worth of Ritual points, I decided to give this place a try as I was craving pizza and this was a famous franchise.

I got the small Boston Royal Pizza.. and I sincerely hope that this was not how it was supposed to taste. There was barely any tomato sauce - my pizza literally looked like white dough. It was very bland overall.. the shrimp had no flavour and neither did the pepperoni. I could only taste the onions and green peppers on a white piece of dough that was also unflavourful. For the price of the pizza, I was expecting a lot better quality!"}
{"text":"Ayant déjà été aux États-Unis, j'évitais son ouverture à Laval comme la peste. J'ai quand même dû y aller pour faire plaisir à une amie. Un mot : MAUVAIS, tout est mauvais, les pâtes, les pizza, les frites, TOUT!!!! Je suis assez ouverte pour les restos et donne la chance au coureur, mais celui-ci est à ÉVITER. Faites quelques pas un peu plus loin dans le Centropolis et vous aurez une dizaine de restos qui vous regardent en pleine face."}
{"text":"Food was awful service was slow!  It took forever to get our food.  Never mind the cold pasta I ordered which I sent back and wait 20 mins for a new plate. Won't be back here again!"}
{"text":"Just came from calgary zoo with inlaws a toddler and a baby. Asked the waiter for my toddlers food first got it right away. My toddler than dumped ranch dressing all over his spaghetti and was picking at it. Waiter offered to have it remade even though it was clearly not anything they did. Between everyone being tired cranky emotional the waiter we had was spot on. Ordered some thai bites,nachos, pizza sliders, a big salad and the burito Without the bread. All of it was spot on. I am not usually a fan a BPs so the service we recieved from the waiter was second to none. So good in fact I even wrote a note expressong my appreciation for how he handled our tablr and I tipped him more.  Thanks bp for the evening. Cheers"}
{"text":"2017.10.31. Halloween. After moving everything to Calgary from Lethbridge, we had our first meal at the Boston Pizza. Boston Pizza has so many locations in Calgary too. The location we were been, located on 130 Ave South East Calgary. It's nearby Walmart, Lowe's Home, Superstore, Homedepot and etc. The location is very convenience for people to find and park their cars. It was our first time been to this place. We arrived this place around 8 pm. The restaurant was super busy and full. After waited for a few minute, the waitress led us to our table, which is on the dining side of the restaurant. After we sat down, our server brought the menu and drinks to the table. The server was nice and friendly. I had Hot Water with Lemon and my boyfriend had $8 Draft Beer for drinks. Then, we ordered pizza bread for starter and Pasta & Beef Dipp for the main meal. The pizza bread came out fast and it brushed with Italian spices, baked with pizza mozzarella and topped with Parmesan. It served with Santa Fe dip. The taste of pizza bread was great. Only took us less than ten minutes, we were done all the pizza bread. I believed that we were so hungry. :).   Our main meal came out a little bit of slow. We were all in the large portion and well cooked. Mine is Tuesday Pasta Special JAMBALAYA FETTUCCINI + CHEESE GRALLIC BREAD. Marinara sauce with chicken breast, shrimp, spicy Italian sausage, tomatoes and green peppers. Topped with green onions. My boyfriend had THE BIG DIPPER + CACTUS CUT POTATOES + RANCH. The beef dipper is sliced steak placed on a toasted garlic-brushed bun with melted pizza mozzarella, braised onions, roasted red peppers and crispy onion straws. Served with horseradish mayo and au jus. Both dishes were so tasty and delicious. We enjoyed our dinner. The only minus thing eating at BOSTON PIZZA is that the prices of the food were very expensive. The whole meal cost us like $80."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is a hit-or-miss chain that I find to be reasonably good during peak hours and not that great during non-peak hours. It's unfortunate because there are times that I think this could be a really good chain. 

The lounge is generally livelier with many TV's and the bar-height tables and a few booths. And especially during non-peak hours, the lounge looks like a better choice than a desolate dining room. We visited at 4:30 on a Sunday and had a simple meal of nachos and wings. So what could be so bad?

To start with, the nachos are anemic in terms of cheese and beef. Aside from a few lightly dusted nacho chips, there wasn't much else below the top level. We had to send them back and ask for more cheese and beef (I even offered to pay more). What has to be the simplest dish to make, I guess they missed the \"layering\" aspect of loaded nachos.

The wings came and looked really good until we took a bite and realized they were cold. The waitress offered to take them back and they said they would comp us the wings. So as we got the nachos back, we waited for the wings, which did come back warmer.

The waitress tried her best and was nice enough but there seems to be an absent-mindedness that permeates the lounge area. I'm not sure if it't short staffed at 4:30 but we just didn't get great service or great food and that really is disappointing since I have had great service and food in the past."}
{"text":"steak with potato pizza  $15.99 for a small which had 8 slices. I thought the toppings were put on very sparingly. It could have used a bit more of everything (meat, cheese and sauce).

crispy chicken pecan salad $8.79 for a small - the salad wasn't very fresh. The carrots and lettuce just didn't have that fresh crisp to it. The chicken didn't even taste as good as Mc D's chicken nuggets.

I just couldn't wait to finish the meal and leave."}
{"text":"Iv been dying to write a review for this Boston Pizza since forever, so here it goes...

The food is here is good, no doubt about it, but the prices are kinda high for the portions you're getting. The food is flavorful and delicious, Iv tried the T-bone Steak(always medium rare)  with a Caesar salad and it was really good and tender. I would've posted a picture but I was too hungry for that. On a different occasion, Iv also tried the pizza and its really tasty but again kinda pricey, so its good to split it with friends. On Saturday's they have a Budweiser special going on, which was good since I did come here on a Saturday last time. Try the potato skins, really good!

I wouldn't come here all the time but definitely once in a blue moon is good enough."}
{"text":"Been to Other Boston Pizzas before, this one ain't my favorite. 

Came here with some family for a nice dinner, ordered a couple of pizzas and some sandwich and chicken finger entrees. The service here was not on point, our server seemed inpatient. The food was okay. Nothing spectacular. I wouldn't really bother coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Thursday night we had a going away party for my co-worker who also got a job downtown.  We wanted to go some place local and hopefully on the patio.  Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be as the bar and patio were booked by a corporate party.  Phooey!

The hostess got a table of 10 in the dining room and she actually put the tables together herself.  Good service.  We had to wait while the rest of our party showed up.  There was a lady who was taking care of us for the first half hour for drinks only and then she disappeared, never to be seen again.  We had to wave down a waiter and we told him that she did not come back to take our meal orders.  He informed us that he instead would be taking care of us for the rest of the night.  Strange that they both did not tell us before hand.  Not really impressed.

I ordered what I always order when I go to Boston Pizza.  An individual Rustic Italian pizza.  It is my \"favourite\" pizza at this place.  Their pizza is so-so to OK and it is hella overpriced.  For many years, it has never blew me away and I never really want to eat pizza here because of it's mediocrity .  It's just \"there\".  I always choose other pizza establishments which are much better and you pay for better taste.  I have ordered pasta at this franchise and it is absolutely horrible.  Some of the worst pasta I have ever had in my life!  Sometimes I think, why are they still in business?

The pizza came and it looked decent as it always does.  Big chunky toppings (too big if I were to criticize), cooked to okay standards, crispy crust, same 'ole tired story.  I finished my meal and was satisfied, I enjoyed it and was content.  It always could be better.  Would I come back?  Never on my call, only if I had to be there."}
{"text":"So bad. We waited at our tables for 25 mins, before getting the waiters attention. Really disorganized. We were told that she wasn't informed of us sitting here."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late night/early morning pizza an were very impressed.  We came back the next evening for dinner and had the chicken wings.  Both were excellent!  The best pizza I've had in Vegas. The wings were very good as well, although the medium sauce wasn't very hot.  The came with a drink and a huge side of fries for $7.99.  A great deal.  We'll definitely be back they next time we're in Vegas.  My only request for improvement here: ditch the Pepsi and get Coke!"}
{"text":"This place is always spot on. It can certainly be a little on the greasy side, but on the rare occasions that I actually order pizza, I want to indulge. The price is great in comparison to the proportion and the staff is always friendly (even when really busy)."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is probably a place that is meant for a group a guys to watch a game and drink a lot because the food quality is not really up to par.  I ordered a fettuccine alfredo pasta dish with chicken and mushrooms and the chicken was tasteless and the alfredo sauce was bland.  This chain really needs to upgrade their food quality as I would not be going back to eat until it does.  The ambience is family friendly on one side and bar friendly on the other side, which is a great mix, now if they could only fix the quality of food problem, this place would thrive."}
{"text":"This is based on an experienced I had a while ago, but I have never returned since then.

I paid over $30 for a pizza that was described as \"Meat, meat and more meat\". Got home, opened the box, it looked like those $5 frozen pizzas with barely enough pepperoni to cover 2/3 of the pizza, and room between the pepperoni slices.

I complained and never heard back from them, so I've been avoiding this chain ever since."}
{"text":"Honestly the best pizza I've EVER had. nice lil diner inside too not to expensive"}
{"text":"Gonna give Boston Pizza a middle-of-the-road rating.

I've come to this Boston Pizza location a handful of times. Once for food, the rest primarily for drinks.

I find the location to be great, central to most of Mississauga. The patio is also a good size - makes for a good place to spend summer afternoons/evenings.

Service was rather dreadful when myself and our friends visited last night. It took about half an hour for us to settle our bills (given about 9 of us, but half were paying cash). The waiter would come by, set up the credit card machine - and walk off, not coming back for another 5-10 minutes. 

They should consider re-allocating staff to help out. The patio was about half full, but there was only one person managing that entire area.


Can't comment on the food at this point, maybe if the chance comes up that I end up trying it."}
{"text":"I am sad to say but I am not a fan of this location at all. I use to really enjoy Boston Pizza before I changed my diet to a gluten free/vegan one. I have however always found a big difference is quality & service depending the location. My favourite one is the BP in Pickering off Brock road. 

Atmosphere- Just like any other Boston Pizza, nothing very special. Loud, a lot of families, people catching a game. Not really my cup of tea.

Service- Service was good. Very friendly, girl had a big smile on her face. Attentive but could have been a little better at that. Forgot to place part of my order but handled it very well.

Food-Discussing! For my diet I got the gluten free pasta in basic tomato sauce & added  the side of mixed veggies in my pasta. The sauce was very salty, the veggies tasted microwaved & the pasta was FREEZER BURNT! I had to send back my first plate it was so gross. Who serves freezer burnt food. That's so gross! If that's all you have left tell the customer you ran out or something. To just slop any crap on my plate. 

I ended up emailing boston pizza customer service about the freezer burnt pasta & on the website they say they'll write you back in 2 business days. It's been over a week & I haven't gotten word back from them 

I will never be eating at another boston pizza again nor will I recommend the company."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write a review for this location but finally getting around to it. The food is nothing special but the only thing I like is the Bandera Pizza Bread. Service is even worse then the food, my server got my order wrong three times and did not even apologize. I did not end up eating anything besides the appetizer. I was greatly disappointed in how the server and manager handled the situation and would not expect anything if I do go back. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Not bad. Had a pepperoni pizza with anchovies and bell pepper. It was hot and the crust was nice. Delivery was as promised. It was a little pricey and the guy in the phone was hard to understand but I would order it again. Taste trumps convenience every time!"}
{"text":"I stopped into this old school Vegas joint for a late lunch.  They have an extensive menu of classic Italian favorites. I was greeted by friendly staff upon arriving.  I ordered lemon pepper chicken fingers and my partner ordered pepperoni pizza.  A great wall mural showed the journey of boston pizza from the old world.  A visit to the restroom showed a clean and tidy space.  Our food arrived and I had a heaping plate of fat cut French fries with my chicken fingers. My partner's pizza was on homemade crust and complete with gooey gooey goodness.  The food arrived very hot and promptly.  I will definitely visit again - they are open late and a perfect place for late night pizza near the strip"}
{"text":"We came on a very cold day and there were plenty of tables available, so finding a seat wasn't an issue.
I ordered a soup because I wasn't really hungry and didn't feel like eating something heavy.
I was mostly catching up with my friend after not seeing her for several months, so we were busy. The server brought us our order and left us continue chatting.
The soup was good but not something to die for. I didn't order any drinks or more food so I can't comment on that. I felt the experience was between okay and good but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"All the TV are showing MMA with bleeding scene when eating with kids! Never come again! The show suppose started at 10p!? Kids friendly restaurant no longer for kids"}
{"text":"OK, I'll just state the facts here and keep it short: This place is wildly expensive for the quality of food. Honestly the meal and portion size reminded me of a frozen dinner. 

In my opinion, you gotta be a little tipsy to think this is good eatin'!"}
{"text":"Was here weekend of 9/12 & stopped late to order. The combo type one was good. not the best I have had but not the worst. Woke up in the morning to some good azz cold pizza.  I love cold pizza."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Staff was very welcoming, good atmosphere and had great service. Ordered the garlic shrimp spaghetti with garlic bread. Plate came out and did not look as delicious as the menu picture. Spaghetti was a little too dry, few shrimp for the price and found an added $2.00 charge for the cheese! Was not really impressed :("}
{"text":"Coworkers and I eat here a lot. Good price for lunch menu $10 plus tax and tips. Mac and cheese is gone from the lunch menu though, I would like that back. I ordered Monday pizza special. It's like a meat lover's pizza. I really like the bread of the pizza. It's consistent in quality at this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a new branch, recently opened and I guess that was the reason it took 20 minutes for the front desk to finish her talk over the phone and give me a table. 
Another half an hour for the waitress to get my order. The food quality was the same as any other BP branch but it was obvious that employees were clueless on how to treat the guests. 

I guess wait another 3-6 months till employees settle there."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, lower prices than other local places, other great food, hole-in-the wall :) Do it!!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't busy. We were greeted right away .However the waitress was too busy eating and flirting with a guy at the bar to come take our order so we had to go to her. Ribs came out cold so I sent them back to get redone aka microwaved. Not good. No apology given. 
No wet naps offered. 
And such a strange lounge set up.
All in all no thank you. 
We didn't stay long."}
{"text":"Service as stated in the reviews ... sucks. 
Our waitress barely came around ... except to talk to the other server... menus were sticky, we had just come from a movie and yet none of us were informed of the special deal if you had a movie ticket stub.
Boston Pizza seldom agrees with my stomach so I opted out of eating, but none of the people I was with seemed \"wow-ed\" by anything.... pretty standard, crappy service. I wont be back if I can help it."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery from work. I made sure they delivered to my work before I ordered. THEY made sure to get my WORK phone number so they could contact me when they arrived. They told me it would be 45 minutes. After an hour I called and the guy said the driver was on the way. After an hour and a half I called again and he said they were busy and the driver was on the way. After an hour and 45 minutes I called and they said the driver was waiting outside my work and called multiple times. I asked what number and they said the one from the caller ID. I told them I don't get service from inside my work and I told them to call my work phone and asked why they didn't use it when they asked for it. We got in an argument and he told me he didn't want to send his driver back and I told him to keep his (bleeping) pizza."}
{"text":"Sigh.

I came in with a friend on a Friday night, and we were hungggrrrryyyyy. I ordered two appetizers - the pizza spring rolls and cactus cut chips, and my friend ordered the butter chicken fettucine (although I warned him not to... How are these honkies going to get butter chicken right?!). The pizza spring rolls were really good, the chips were decent, but the pasta... Oh, the pasta. So bad. My premonition about the honky-made butter chicken came true. I'm the least picky eater I know, but the flavours were just so... Off. It tasted like the only spices they used were salt and pepper.

We barely touched the pasta, but the waitress didn't notice/care. I work in the service industry, and when my patrons clearly aren't enjoying their food, I always ask what's wrong and fix the situation. I didn't want to complain, so we just let it be and asked for our bill. We ended up paying $60 (sans alcohol) for an extremely mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Pizza, Pasta AND allot more at this place.  I enjoyed a split pizza of \"the Perogy\" which has spicy cactus potatoes, spinach, smokey Bacon and so much more.  The   other have was the Tuscan which had great flavor.  

A Molson Canadian draft and  good pizza is a great choice in Canada.  The staff was helpful with the large menu."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza but but delivery was slow and the driver barely spoke any English. I'm from an area of the country where they take pizza seriously, most places in vegas just throw sub par ingredients on cheap dough and sell it. Haven't had any pizza in vegas that impressed me...yet.."}
{"text":"The servers tend to forget/ignore you. Waitied 15 - 20 mins just to get a beverage. Not one of the better locations, but it was close."}
{"text":"I've been to the Boston Pizza restaurants several times over the years.

Today was different in that we went as a family.

We all have some food issues, and the Newmakret location has really stepped up for people with allergies or who need to eat gluten free food.

I had a double portion of wings that were twice baked, and my wife had the pasta.  We also brought home a pizza for my son.

The wings were very nice.  I ordered the salt and pepper wings.  Tasty, juicy, and well spiced.

My wife really enjoyed the pasta.  This says a lot.  Most gluten free pasta is an afterthought at most restaurants, while this was a masterpiece that was very well though through.  The pasta was also a different colour which made it easier for the staff to make sure the correct pasta was served.

The gluten free pizza was also excellent according to my son.  They use the kinnikinnick pizza crust.  It is gluten free.  It is not a huge pizza but he quality more than made up for it.  It's enough to serve one.

The manager went out of their way to make sure that the experience was top notch from start to finish.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Eat24 and food was delivered early! Food was still warm and served with all necessary utensils and condiments. Calzone was delicious and huge, fried mushrooms were good as well."}
{"text":"Awful place to go to. The staff is rude. We have been to this location on 4 different occasions and everytime it is the same.

We first went because we recived a promotion from Boston pizza and made the staff member aware the we came with coupons. Only after the meal did she mention that they could not be used at their location.

The other time we went the food served to us was cold and we waited a very long time for it. Despite the fact that the restaurant only have 3 tables of people it was hard to flag down our waitress 

We tried ordering on the phone and the agent was very rude. When she had a hard time hearing us instead of being polite she hung up the phone. 

If you're in the area I recommend you go to another restaurant because it's not worth going to this one"}
{"text":"Easy location, cool hip bar with plenty of well placed TVs, and the reliable quality I've grown to expect from BP.  Our party stopped in for the opening week of the '12 NFL season.  We had a great time and will certainly be back next time we are back in Toronto.  Although our server was friendly, the service was a bit slow and infrequent."}
{"text":"Love Boston pizza absolutely done with this location!!! Never had worse service then iv experienced here!! No one makes sure your food is good, or comes and clears your plates we sat for 10 mins before i stacked them myself!!! you pay 3.79 for non stop pop but only ever get one glass cause you never see your wait staff again!! Very disappointing place to be!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had dinner at Boston Pizza last week and after that visit we'll never return.

Our food wasn't good across the board. I created my own pasta (fettuccini and shrimp) and it was so bland. I couldn't even finish it and asked my friend to finish it for me. Even she didn't want to finish it when she usually finishes my food. Another friend of mine asked to switch her entree because the portion was very small. The server responded rudely, \"No offence but I have to pay for it.\" It was a weekday so the restaurant was pretty dead. Service was lacking and the server wasn't friendly.

We will not be returning after we experienced bad food and bad service."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to catch up over some food at Boston Pizza for lunch this week. We arrived around 12:30 pm and it was pretty much empty besides maybe one other table.

What I thought was kind of weird was how the server just came to us and asked what we would like to order without greeting us. Anyhow, I got the individual Hawaiian pizza and my sister got an order of pasta. If you didn't notice already, the individual pizza prices are different when comparing it to the lunch menu. Although, it's the exact same thing.

When the pizza came out I knew it was fresh because it was really hot and the cheese looked exactly like what you would see in pizza commercials. The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. However, it was kind of plain in flavour compared to Pizza Pizza's crust...it kind of tasted like water.

The pizza cost me $10 (including tip)...which I guess is alright but it didn't fill me up. I would rather get a $4 slice of pizza from Pizza Pizza where it would fill me up."}
{"text":"Just walked out. Ten minutes after being seated nobody came to even say hi. Other tables sat after us had received drinks. There were at least four girls stopping at tables all around except for ours."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight. I was expecting it to be busy as it's playoff season. However, there was no wait and we were seated promptly on the second floor. It was Pasta Tuesdays so you can either get a gourmet pasta or create your own pasta dish. I decided to customize my own. This dish starts at $11.99 and you can add toppings which cost a bit more. So, I ordered penne with marinara sauce and chicken breast. The first thing I noticed was that the portions were huge! I had plenty of leftovers to take home. The chicken to pasta proportion was quite small though. Overall, it's decent pasta - nothing really stood out. 

Service was also friendly and attentive. We didn't wait long for the food to arrive and our server checked on us a couple times during the evening. I found that overall, BP is a nice environment to chill with friends or family, as well as to fill your tummy up while watching the game. I wouldn't mind coming back here again."}
{"text":"Horrible service ! Ordered a pizza for delivery across the street and it took 2 and a half hours before we walked over to just get it and it wasn't there it was on the delivery ! And they were not nice about it ! I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Wish I could do negative star
Just got delivered our pizza... And it is revolting.  Completely undercooked basically just floppy dough.  We were very specific about no cheese because one of us is mildly lactose intolerant and it's covered in cheese.. Of course! 


We will never order from here again!  Sorry but all in all was horrible"}
{"text":"First mistake? we did not call ahead and order our pizza 30 minutes prior, second mistake? We ate there on Tuesday, the 2 for 1 large pizza deal...  This pizza is not really good hot right out of the oven, very greasy, it gets better after it has cooled off and the grease has congealed a bit, now go take some cholesterol medicine and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Came here after a few years, heard there was a change in management. I was not impressed with my experience. Ordered jambalaya fetticine with cheese toast. They got the cheese toast wrong and ended up taking it back. When we got our orders is was cold, shrimp wasnt cooked through. We didnt have cutlery...no chilli peppers..we sent our food back they rewarmed it...again, came back with no cutlery...just a crappy experience overall"}
{"text":"45 minutes to get a drink ... And we made prior reservations. More than 2 hours to get our meals. Avoid this location like the plague!"}
{"text":"We were in the area getting art supplies for a school project when all of a sudden we realized we were hungry, there was yet another chain restaurant staring us down, so we decided to give it a try...mostly out of pure laziness.
Um, have you ever seen the 80's sitcom, Saved by the Bell?  Well that's what it feels like in here.  It's weird.  The crowd reminded me of the extras you would see on a program like that and the set, I mean the decor, felt like there might have been people behind the scenes operating the lights.
The food, my children asked if I thought this was made on a conveyer belt then frozen and reheated in a microwave.  I'm not certain, but i would have to say something like that was going on.  Honestly, this was probably the worst food I've had in years.  And we tried a wide variety from an entree: The halibut, to a \"Gourmet\" pizza: artichokes, spinache, sun dried tomatoes, basil, cheese, to a bunch of appetizers: not even worth mentioning because these were inedible, to some pasta: the only thing really OK.
Seriously, I think prisoners are served better cuisine than this.  So it left me wondering, why were there so many people eating here?  I mean if you want to eat at a chain restaurant and not really taste any real flavors, there are like 15 other places in the general vacinity where you can actually eat the food.  Needless to say, i would not eat here again if every other restaurant on North Prospect closed, I was starving, and they were giving away the food at Boston's.  How do you say \"Ick\" with a Boston accent?"}
{"text":"Try the Bacon Penne. Great food at this particular BP location. Only drawback was service was a tad slow and it wasn't busy. My salad was left out but I got it to go on the way out. Bad day, maybe?"}
{"text":"Came here with my family recently and ordered a small Boston Royal pizza, chicken and mushroom fettuccini and a garlic shrimp spaghetti. Honestly, the food was actually decent for the chain restaurants but what really got to us was the service. 

The hostess clearly looked like she didn't want to be there and kept mumbling. Our server took a really long time to come greet us and to take our orders. She didn't provide any utensils until after we got the meal (basically couldn't eat for that duration of time). After finishing the meal, we tried to flag down our server but she was nowhere to be found. 

What was even more ridiculous was the other table beside us had their hand up for the longest time to wave down their server too but other servers (not serving his table) basically ignored them. I understand that each table has their own server but I still don't get why other servers don't try to notify the other server to come help the table. 

We waited for about 15 mins and our server still didn't show up and we just had to walk up to notify the manager. The manager was extremely apologetic but this type of service is unacceptable. Will not be returning even though the food was okay."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza was a great place. I was greeted kindly and had great service. The pizza was also outstanding."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Boston Pizza locations and I am never satisfied. Last night I went in for dinner with my son and the hostess which I assume is probably new asked if I'd like to sit in the dining area or the bar. I was offended because I'm not going to sit in the bar area with my 8 year old and then she asked if I'd like a kids menu. I'm not a rude person but there was either no common sense or she wasn't trained properly. Anyhow, I had the calamari for app and the garlic shrimp spaghetti but instead of shrimp I asked for chicken. The calamari was good. The pasta was not so good. It was soooo bland. It had no flavour at all. It tasted like plain pasta with oil. I told the waitress and she asked me if I wanted for her to take it back to flavour it up. I objected as I had somewhere to be. I literally had 3 bites and Upon paying my bill I was upset that not even a discount was given for the poorly made pasta dish. I will never go back to a Boston Pizza again as it has been one too many bad experiences. I keep giving them chances but unfortunately am never satisfied."}
{"text":"A nice day wasted in this miserable patio with mediocre food....my Big Dipper aka disappointment had very chewy meat....the toppings on the pizza were not very flavorful but the crust was pretty good....it sucks that their lunch specials are only from Monday-friday.....no wonder there was barely any people here on a Sunday afternoon and I mean like only 2 tables......sad that I will never come to Boston pizza again"}
{"text":"We've been coming to this Boston Pizza for over six years (our office is nearby), and the service has always been great.  We primarily eat in the Lounge when we can, so I cannot say too much about the restaurant side.

It's a BP's, so you can expect the same food everywhere...to an extent.  I must say that their garlic twist pizza bread is the best we've ever eaten at any BP's....why?  I'm not sure.  But it is.

We always have a great meal!"}
{"text":"Have been to other Boston Pizza locations over the years (hey it is great with a hockey group). This location is brand spanking new and so is the service and management is extra green. Hope that they recover from numerous snaffus on my one and only visit which were only exacerbated by a manager that was going to make it right, which apparently was $5 off a $60 dollar order that had three errors and issues (including messed up recipes - hey I have been to other locations). Skip it and head west (a few steps) to Duke's.

Hope they learn quickly as it is competitive corner."}
{"text":"I wish I had looked at the terrible reviews before I tried to have a nice evening out with my husband. The only good thing about this restaurant is that the managers are nice. The only way most people meet the managers is because the experience was terrible. I'm not a vindictive person, but I wished they would have fired our server. Not sure of her name, but she serves in the lounge and she's got blonde hair, looks to be about 20-24 yrs old. She's got some bite to her, from glaring looks to dismissing my concern over the meal I ordered. When I mentioned that I felt the pesto flavor was too strong in my pasta her words were \"what do you want me to do about it?\" Wow! Both managers apologized profusely, but too little too late."}
{"text":"This is not the first time we have ordered from this place. Usually we have no issues with our order but this time, the order took so long that by the food got to us, it was cold, plus the cheese on the cheese fries was burnt"}
{"text":"The restaurant was fairly quiet for a weekend with a hockey game. The staff were fairly quick to get us seated as we were part of a group of 13. Our server was friendly but very slow to get us our drinks. My wife asked for a baileys and coffee and the server said they had to brew a pot yet the coffee came back lukewarm. I joked that maybe they added extra baileys and it cooled down, no such luck. Our meals were terribly slow to come and they were incorrect on 4 of the 13 meals. Refills and other drinks were very slow to come and incorrect at times. The manager hovered around the front desk from time to time but never once walked around to see how any tables were doing including ours which was surprising considering our size and we were purchasing drinks with our meals. This is only the second time I have been there even though I live less than 5 minutes away and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Classic Pizza and wings. 
Great place for friends and fun. 
Love the game time TV's. 
Beer and fun all the way. 

Wish they would fix the WiFi."}
{"text":"I travel throughout canada for work. I love Boston Pizza. Good food. Predictable service. Etc. I am away from home 3-4 days a week. 
This visit was terrible. SLOW. SLOW. SERVICE.  I was ignored for 15 minutes when i arrived. I almost left. Lots of other food options in the same area. 
The bartender/ server was more concerned with the young guys at the bar than the paying customers in her area. 
Food as always was good. I had to request a drink 3 times.... excuse me... 
today is Sunday night. Not too busy."}
{"text":"Oh goodness, where do I start? I've been coming to this location for 8 years now but my last visit TOTALLY ruined it for me. I ordered nachos (cactus cut) as well as a pasta to go. Mind you, it was a Tuesday and lunch time so I ordered RIGHT off the lunch menu where it stated that pastas for $10.99. It did not state its size or anything. When I received my bill, I noticed that I was overcharged for the pasta. That's fine- mistakes happen. So I called the waitress over (because she walked away) and told her about what had happened. She told me that I was the one that did not specify what size of the pasta I wanted. There is apparently a \"half size\" and a \"full size.\" The full size is on the normal menu but I did not see anything about a half size...even on the lunch menu and I've ordered pasta at lunch time from Boston Pizza for over 5 years. I asked her what she was talking about as there was nothing mentioned on the lunch menu. She continued to bicker and then resorted to speaking to her manager. Well, she came back after 10 minutes or so and handed me a new bill...no explanation, no nothing. So I asked her myself, what did your manager say? She told me that her manager did not want to argue and to just give it to me. I told the waitress, Argue? I'm not arguing with you. I just wanted to clear something up. After this experience, Boston Pizza has totally lost my business. Like really, you can't handle such a small thing like this without giving attitude and making your customer feel like crap because they noticed something was wrong? Well sorry, I no longer want to associate myself with you guys. Good luck getting long time customers with that attitude!"}
{"text":"This was a decent visit to the BP. Had the fish tacos with a side Greek salad. 

The fish tacos were very tasty but had only a small pieces of fish on it. Could have been better if there was more fish. The Greek salad dressing had kind of a weird taste to it. It was only ok. The wait staff was very polite (Danielle-I think) & effective. I asked for a coffee after the meal & she was smart enough to brew a new pot + let us know she was doing it. 

I'd go here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas... Best wings in Vegas... Fastest delivery in vegas when guy in black corolla delivers, always nice! LOVE LOVE LOVE"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite with my girlfriends last week since it was close to where they live. I usually try to avoid BP's because of previous bad experiences but I really like the Spicy Perogy Pizza so I gave it a shot. We sat in the lounge and it wasnt very busy, our server was friendly and attentive, and our drinks came quickly and tasted really good. We ordered a pizza to share, half Spicy Perogy and half Tuscan and it was actually delicious. I was surprised at the quality but perhaps because it's a new location it's better than most. I would return here but only if there were no other options (or if I'm really craving the pizza!)."}
{"text":"They were busy for UFC 208. The bartender sold me on getting the pizza bread 'souped' up in her words, and punched in the wrong order. That's fine I get it. She's busy mistakes happen. The manager stared at me after she clearly told him what happened. He stared blankly at me and didn't even come to apologize for the mistake. I'm not the type to look for anything to be free but the gesture would have been nice. 

I'm currently in the service industry myself and I can tell you right now that this has been the worst management I have seen in while. Further more the restaurant I work at is twice the size of this place. Disappointed since BP is from my home town."}
{"text":"* Customer service: 3/5
Upon arrival, the guy behind the counter seemed pretty tied-up, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. But he got the job done and thats what's important.

* Cleanliness: 3/5
kitchen looked clean but some of the tables and seats were dirty while the restaurant was slow...

* Food and portion size: 3/5
Portion size was GREAT. But as for the food... let's just say, it was a step above Little Caesars. To explain, we ordered a large Hawaiian and asked for extra sauce (like always), and of course the cheese to sauce ratio did not match. In fact, they drenched the pizza in cheese. Now, don't get me wrong, the cheese was very good and FRESH but was half an inch thick. Pineapple and ham were very fresh and the crust was good.

Honestly, I feel this pizza would only taste good if you're drunk.

* Atmosphere, room capacity, and menu size: 2/5
Restaurant is conveniently located off the strip but towards the older section of Vegas. The place is SKETCHY (like anything else in old Vegas)... pitch black window and door tinting, beat up parking lot, and next to a gentlemen's club. As for the interior; it is very casual, ambiance is dark, seats are oddly colored (couldn't tell if they were dirty or actually that color) and the menu was rather large for a pizza place.

* Price :5/5
Price was GREAT. $16.00 for a large with 2 toppings.

* Recommend or return?
No, I will not recommend this place unless you LOVE cheese and/or drunk. Unfortunately, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"SERVICE SUCKS. Dropped in here for a quick lunch during a Wednesday afternoon. The hostesses were nice enough, but that was the end of the good service. My friend and I were one of maybe 6 tables in the place. We ordered quickly, a couple of flatbreads from the lunch menu. 45 minutes later our food finally shows up (hadn't seen our server once in that time). The food was totally cold and was obviously sitting out for a while (there was a skin on the dipping sauce for our fries). The server, when she finally came around, could not have cared less. The manager did end up taking care of our food for us, but the fact that two little tiny flatbreads took 45 minutes and the server had NO clue that it happened? That's just sad."}
{"text":"I really liked their old menu. But i am sad to see my favourite pizza discontinued. The staff is nice enough to make it every time i asked them to make it from old menu. But it does takes a lot of explaining. I wish they just had a customer poll before taking away what Boston Pizza was really good for."}
{"text":"BP brings back quite a bit of memory for me. All good memory. In my last job, I used to work above BP and I would smell BP from the vent all the time. As well, after meetings, we would go downstairs for drinks and appies. But that was my past life. 

So at work, we ordered BP for lunch. We ordered couple pizzas. But they were not wow. Also it takes them 1.5 hours to make and deliver it to the office (downtown). Pizza is kind of too doughy. I have had better pizza."}
{"text":"I came here on a late night with my boyfriend just for some drinks and dessert.

There's a new dessert on the menu called the \"chocolate doughcano\" and we were very intrigued.

It's basically a cheesecake wrapped in pizza dough and deep fried. The actual dessert was a bit too much for me. However, the service here was great and the coffee was delicious.

I used to not like Boston Pizza but the two visits I had this year is starting to convert me into liking this chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"'BP' as they try to market is awful. Used to be a regular here but once they removed the 'fish bowl fridays' I vowed to never come back. I was dragged here by a group few years later and it gave me a friendly reminder why I stopped going. All the food is terrible, yes I'm blanketing everything on the menu. Far better choices in this price range"}

{"text":"Always a pleasant experience at the Sunridge Boston Pizza.
The foods fresh, the servers are nice, and I really enjoy their Entertainment on the weekends.
One of the better BP's in Calgary to Eat at. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"One of the Better Boston Pizzas.

Every time I've dined in at the Airdrie location It's been a hassle-free, pleasant and entertaining.

They offer an interesting twist ( no pun intended ) on Friday Nights and Sunday Nights having a local Magician/Balloon twister come in and perform for the kids.

This is something I'd love to see more restaurants offer as it keeps the keeps calm and the experience for the guests pleasant and humorous.

The staff have always been amazing, smiling and creating a great atmosphere, along with the food always being fresh and tasting great.

Nothing bad to say about it, my experience there has always been awesome!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I'm in the Saddletowne Area I need a place to unwind and relax.
The Boston Pizza here does just that job!

The staff are friendly, the food is great, and the way the restaurant is laid out is incredible.

The Bar section is very open, giving it a bright, new age feel. The hostesses and servers there are also very pretty, so you can't go wrong on a Sat night drinking a few beers and striking up a fun conversation with them.

I always enjoy my visits here. 4/5."}
{"text":"I don't usually want to review franchises but I do have to give credit where credit is due. I had a very satisfying Cobb salad at this particular location. More expensive than its worth of course, but it did taste very good."}
{"text":"The pizza here was average. It was extremely greasy, but overall, it was good. The wings were the best part. They were crunchy and cooked all the way through. The prices are a low too high for the quality, but it was good, especially for being open so late."}
{"text":"Average restaurant decor is nice.  Service at sometimes is a bit slow. The next table beside us they spilled a drink by accident and there was a couple waitresses that walked By and didn't do anything."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this location for dinner. The pasta is incredible! So fresh and creamy!

The service was also amazing.  It's a week night so the bartender was multitasking and she did great! 

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if these folks were having a bad night or whether this is typical of this restaurant. We waited more than twenty minutes for the server to get to our table. The drinks were OK (ish), but the kitchen took another forty minutes to get our food out and of our three orders, two came out wrong. 

Although the server did try to make things right, it was pretty much a lost cause. That was probably our last visit to that location."}
{"text":"Although I typically like Boston Pizza, this one really is a \"Meh\" kind of place. Nothing special. The atmosphere is kinda gloomy. The food is ok, depending on what you get. I do like their cactus cut fries, because they come with a good dipping sauce. Their pizza is ok, and their Swiss mushroom burger is actually pretty alright. But whatever you do, do not order their BP Burger. It is just their regular burger with \"special\" sauce. No one knows what the sauce tastes like because they only put a tiny little drop of of it on the bun. You will not notice it unless you inspect the bun with a microscope. It is THE driest burger ever made. Boo. I hate when food makes me sad. It made me very sad. :'(

There really is a million other better choices to grab food in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It has been over 4 years I have not been to Boston Pizza, but I decided to try it out again after all my other options were closed. So I know if you come to Boston Pizza you should have the pizza, but I really wanted pasta. So I ordered plain penne with marinara sauce. In the menu it says juicy fresh cherry tomatoes with fresh grounded basil and oregano with a side of frilled garlic panini bread. Let me tell you this was not the plate that was described in the menu. I swear the sauce was Classico sauce you buy at your grocery store. There was no fresh grounded basil. The bread was a grilled toast not a panini. Overall it sucked. I now remember why I did not like it 4 years ago. I will definitely not make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"Need a hockey fix and Boston Pizza took care of it.  Each Friday a few of us link up and enjoy dinner at Boston Pizza.  The food is exceptional and the past two weeks our server Kim was awesome.  She kept the drinks flowing and food coming.  Boston Pizza truly understand customer service and what is takes to keep a customer happy and coming back for more."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 or 4 times and generally haven't had too many issues other than slow service, which is an issue I find common at most BP's. This time I decided to try their online ordering service. I placed my order and received my email confirmation. The promised delivery time came and went. Half an hour later I finally decided to check on the order and they never received it. I was given some story that sometimes orders or sent to the wrong stores when ordered online. If this is a consistent problem, then don't accept online orders, or better yet, hire a service to do it for you. They said that since their kitchen was now closed they would transfer my order to a location that was still open, which would mean another 45 minute wait. I'm a VERY patient person, but at this point it would mean I would have been waiting nearly 2 hours for my order without any offer of compensation. I still would recommend their dine in options, but as for their online ordering system, I would stay as far away from it as possible unless they started using a service like Just Eat or Waiters En Route."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Boston Pizza.  I worked right across the street from them for years and ate there all the time.  I never EVER got anything that was not delicious!  But their cheese steak is hands down my favorite!  Maybe a bit pricey but worth every penny.  Their chicken strips are extremely good as well, and I rarely eat chicken strips.  Maybe their staff could be a little friendlier but honestly....their food is what I care about.  

I miss them terribly, as I live in Pahrump and hardly ever get over that way, but when I am anywhere near it....that is my go to place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, so it was quite busy. The waitress still did her best to accommodate us. We had the veggie pasta (can't remember the name exactly; it was off of the 10 for 10 menu). Probably the best pasta I've had at Boston Pizza to date."}
{"text":"I've never had a good pizza delivery experience in Vegas. Boston Pizza changed that. It's Friday night and I stayed in with a friend and a lot of wine. A lot of wine later, and this place is the only one willing to deliver. Also, holy mother of Thor, are they GOOD. Not even just \"I'm drunk and hungry\" level good; I mean, legit good."}
{"text":"Let me start this review off by saying at this particular location I almost always have a bad experience. Why do I keep coming back to you Boston Pizza.. why? Well I have no self control and part of me really loves bps pizza and their spinach dip. Usually when I go here it feels like I'm a ghost, its impossible to get the bare minimum of service. I've had orders come wrong with no attempt to repair or apologize, once I ordered takeout and instead of a chipotle dip they literally gave me marinara sauce with sriracha..... When I called to question this the woman on the phone; who was completely unpleasant tried to sell to me that was the chipotle dip and always had been.... lady please. 
Anyways! Why this place now gets three stars for me is the somewhat redeeming experience I had last night. Our server was really friendly and sweet to my little sister. He was funny and engaging without being overbearing and constantly had refilsl for us, even if our cups were half full which made me and my sister giggle but I still appreciated. I wish I could remember his name but to the younger gentleman who worked Sunday night, you kicked butt and did a great job!!"}
{"text":"Prices have been on the rise in this mid range of restaurants.  I'm starting to think that BPs is slowly pricing themselves out of the picuture.  The good news is that the food across the locations we frequent is consistent, no ugly surprises or let downs.  The bad news is that for the kind of food you get, you have better ambiance and service at a place like Jack Astors or Chilis.  BP's prices are getting too close to Joey Tomatoes or Moxies for my taste."}

Its exactly what you expect for a mid range family restaurant. Completely undramatic in every way which may not be a bad thing!

Boston Pizza is one of our go-to places when we just want a quick simple meal.  They're pretty consistent for food quality and this location has the added benefit of being in the mall.  The concern at this location is speed of service and food prep.  The kitchen here takes FOREVER and it seems like the staff move around at a glacial pace.  One touch I always look for is whether or not the servers let my glass go empty for prolonged periods or whether they come by with refills as I'm getting low.  Its a good measure of whether they're on the ball.  At this location, they don't even bother to offer you a refill unless you ask.  They're simply not staffed for it."}
{"text":"As a visitor, I selected this pizzeria base on the stars & review. I ordered the Boston Special. It was \"meh\", little too much cheese, greasy, too thick of a crust. When the pizza was delivered, it was to my surprise that the pizza wasn't kept warm inside some kind of insulated box. It came in its usual card board box. I asked for cheese & red crush peppers, I got one of each, guess I needed to specify. Doubt that I'd place another order again."}
{"text":"One of the worst locations. We went there to celebrate an occasion (before 7pm) and the dining area was almost empty. However, they told us ALL tables there are booked for 8pm and we have to sit in the sport lounge which was crowded and loud. We are no sports fans and it was little disturbing to sit there and listen to all yelling, etc. When the waitress came (without menus) we asked about one pizza that has spicy chicken in it. We wanted to know if its just mild spicy or very spicy (sometimes there is almost no spice at all, so we asked about the level of spice). Waitress told us \"Its not spicy at all!\" So we ordered it. Oh my God, it was soo spicy, my lips wehere burning for half an hour after (just from few bites! (And I am used to mild spicy Indian dishes that I love!) We sent the pizza away, even though waitress did not apologize about her mistake, she assumed - we just did not like it. After we finished our 2nd dish (salmon, that was pretty thin and little burned, not juicy at all) we wanted to leave but noticed that dinning area is still empty. We asked to talk to the manager (Indian woman) who argued with us and did not care about anything. well, I guess its restuarant service in Canada, specially so close to airport. We told her we will never come back again, and she was like \"Ok\"."}
{"text":"Food is like all the other Boston Pizza's but the service is really a hit and miss depending on which waiter/waitress you get."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is one of those franchises I consider under-rated because of their old reputation. Their pizza is always quite good and gradually improves. I strongly recommend their Spicy Pierogi pizza or the Sombrero."}
{"text":"I normally dread having to go to places like this; it's the combined apprehension of coworker lunchtime (watching the clock), the resonating belching of military personnel from the nearby base burping loudly into their beer, and the fact that this place smells more like a bar than a restaurant.  Today, however, the sun was high and the patio was calling our name. Patios can truly make or break a dining experience, especially in this industrial/commercial no-man's land.

Not bad!  Not too shabby by my standards. Had the steak sandwich with a side salad (on the paltry side) but everything seemed fresh and service was acceptable.  Although this place is uncomfortably dark inside, the light of day on the patio revealed that all of our orders were presentable and free of suspicious objects or burnt edges! Yay!  Success!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised when my friend brought me here for lunch one day. It looks tiny from the outside and where it's located, I never would have ventured here on my own. I'm glad we all went as a group though, the food was great and the portions were huge. They have really awesome specials. The food took a bit to prepare but they made it from scratch so it was totally worth the wait. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday and they have great lunch specials. I had the pizza of the day, my wife and mother in law each had the chicken quesadilla and my father in law had the mini beef dip sandwich. Each was 10$. The food came quick and everything was delicious. The only negative thing is that there was very few staff and so the service was slow but they were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Only came here because our Airbnb was right across the street and we needed a quick eat before the Blue Jays game. 

Based off most of the reviews I have to agree with them; this spot is overpriced considering what you get for your money (food that is edible at best and service that isn't that great). When we stopped by there were only about 4 tables that had people sitting down at and 2 waiters but yet we still had to wait about 15 minutes before we even got our water and menus. 

To make things worst we asked our server if he knew if any of the dough was vegan (HUGE MISTAKE); it took him almost another 10 minutes to come back and tell us yes that the thin crust is vegan and they can do a pizza with just veggies and sauce. So we went with their veggie pizza on thin crust (no cheese of course) and ordered a side of fries. I have to say that the fries were the only thing worth eating (as they always are because who can mess up fries!?!?!). The pizza crust was very tough and hard to chew and the sauce had no flavor; it just tasted like pureed tomato topped with mushroom, bell pepper, and onion. 

Now one thing I will compliment them on is their bartenders! We walked up after our meal (didn't want to wait another 10 minutes just to get our drinks from the server) and ordered a vodka soda but asked the lady to make them doubles. She let us know that she can make us a fish bowl which has 4 shots total in it and it costs less than ordering two doubles. WINNER WINNER!!! 

I wish I could say I will be coming back here next time I visit Toronto but that's not looking so good."}
{"text":"Not a family place. 
Went in for a few beers & wings and never got the second beer. The server was more concerned about her closing duties and talking to the mamager who never acknowledge us either. 
On a side note the washrooms 3 of the 4 washrooms were dirty and the handicapped was flooded.."}
{"text":"I've had a few days to cool down from my experience here, and I still feel as disappointed as the moment I got my food.  How this place stays open with its unique combination of very bad \"frozen entree\"-esque food and arrogantly high prices, set in a loud and unappealing atmosphere is a great Toronto mystery.  From the smoky patio with its dead or dying cedars to the filthy toilets, virtually every element of this chain \"pizzeria\" compares unfavorably to eating at a college buddy's bachelor pad.  

My seafood penne was served with those tiny frozen shrimp you buy in a bag, with a reconstituted sauce that might as well have been milk, margarine and salt.  The cheese on my wife's nachos was like superglue.  We figured out why when they were sent back having been served without chicken as requested: \"I'll just put some on and zap it for you\", she said.   The guacamole was definitely from a powder, jar or can--disgusting!  I make terrible food from my freezer at home for a fraction of the price.  This place saps all the joy of dining out. One of my top 10 worst eating experiences of all time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner with some friends. We made reservations cause we thought it would be busy cause the Jays game was on. But it was pretty slow night for BP. 

I ordered the individual vegetarian pizza (onions, tomato, mushrooms and green peppers), which was pretty decent. Crust wasn't all soggy or overcooked like you would get at times. It could have stayed in the oven a bit longer though, as the cheese wasn't completely melted. I also tried a slice of my friends Mediterranean Pizza (mozzarella, spinach, sundried tomatoes, marinated artichoke hearts, feta and drizzled with pesto) and it was sooooo good - I wish I had ordered this instead of the veggie pizza. 

The only reason why I'm giving this review 2 stars instead of a 3 or 4 is cause the service wasn't there - really, it wasn't. Our server was m.i.a. majority of the time. Every time he came to get our order he would only take one persons order, and he would run off before the next person could give him their order. We would have to get another server to get him to come back and take our order and the same thing would repeat again. He also didn't get my friends drink order right, she ordered a specific type of Caesar from the menu, she fully pointed at it. When he brought the drink over, the she tried it and said it was the wrong one. He said sorry and he took it away and brought back another - it still wasn't the right one..He never came by to ask us how the dinner was going and never refilled our water without being asked multiple times. 
 I know not all servers are like this, it was just a shame our server gave us a bad experience that evening. Hopefully next time we come back, it'll be a better experience"}
{"text":"I come here occasionally because PASTA TUESDAYS. You get garlic bread and a choice from the \"gourmet pasta\" list for $10.99+tax, which I think is pretty fair. Despite coming here occasionally, I always manage to get a different server each time I come. They don't deliver exceptional customer service, but I don't expect as much for the price point and ambience of the restaurant anyway. 

Upon entering, half the time there will be a hostess there, but if it's dead inside, you'll likely need to hail someone down so they know you're there and where you'll be sitting. I personally like the booths in either dining room or bar. I'm happy that they've finally gotten rid of their pesky fruit fly problem. It used to be something I expected coming to this location each time because they would ALWAYS be flying around my food. I haven't seen them for the last year, so THANK YOU BP for finally getting rid of them. 

Accompanying the subpar service (sometimes you'll get a server who will actually ask how things are going, but not always and will need to hail someone down), the food you get is pretty decent. Sometimes your garlic toast may be burnt, so keep an eye on that. I usually ask for fresh parm for any pasta I order because I feel like their table cheese is too old and hard for my liking. I recommend the Thai Chicken Bites as an appetizer. They say they haven't decreased their portions, but I've been coming here since they introduced it, and they certainly have since its introduction. I still think it's a good dish despite its downsize - be sure to have a lot of water at bay though because it's pretty hot! I used to have their nachos, which were pretty good, but I no longer recommend it. They changed their recipe from the coloured nachos and melted cheese to regular nachos and some sort of cheese drizzle with melted cheese. Now a good quarter of my appetizer feels soggy and I'm not 'bout paying full price for soggy nachos. Sometimes I'll get cactus cut potato chips, which are pretty hot, but addicting. In regards to main dishes, the Chicken Parm (with a side of spaghetti and bolagnese sauce) is a personal favourite of mine. It comes with steamed vegetables and garlic toast. The chicken has melted cheese on it and I love it. Gourmet pastas I recommend for Pasta Tuesdays: Baked Seven Cheese Ravioli for you cheese lovers, and Chicken Mushroom Fettucini for those who are watching what they eat. I've tried most of their gourmet pastas and have never been disappointed. I believe one of them is called the Spicy Italian Jambalaya...something like that. That one is SUPER filling, but also if you check the nutritional content, you'll find out why with the fat macros you're getting. I personally wouldn't order a gourmet pasta unless it's Tuesday because their regular prices seem steep, going up to $17.50, if I recall correctly. I should mention that BP has american influences too, if it wasn't obvious. My italian friends are never impressed with any of the pasta here whenever I come with them, but I enjoy it. It's NOT made al dente like most would expect from a regular italian restaurant. For pizza, I've only had it once at this location, and it was okay - it was thai-inspired but I do not recall the name. 

Desert wise, I think everything is overpriced and it is not worth it. I've had the Cookie Panooki (not sure if that is the correct spelling), and it tasted okay, but the previous sentence still stands. Sometimes they will have specials where you can order a pasta and a soup or dessert for a fixed price. They had this during the Christmas season, but am not sure if it is annual or not. They had tiramisu as a desert option for that, and I enjoyed it very much. 

Drinking alcohol? I like the Peach Mojito and/or the Twisted Rocket. Depending on who makes the Twisted Rocket, it may be enough to get you a bit buzzed because one time I found mine with a good half being alcoholic content (it shouldn't be, but I didn't mind). 

Overall, I find this location has inconsistent service depending on who you get, but the gourmet pasta has always been good enough to keep me coming back on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I came here to take advantage of the free thin crust pizza.  I came in and was met with a very courteous and polite server.   He was extremely nice and polite.   Even though I didn't come here to spend any money,  I got my free pizza.   The thin crust pizza was really delicious.   I had a good time and the bill came out to $0.   I did tip the server more than the standard 15% of the bill since he was pretty friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Big fan of the healthy options menu - 5 gold stars for even including this option amidst a carby, cheesy menu that makes me gain weigt just perusing it. And we've got calorie, sodium and fat counts here people - we might not be in Toronto anymore. The only downfall is that the healthy options menu is fairly limited, with about 5 or 6 items in total.

This place also has great drink specials on Thursdays - and because I can't be all work and no play, I ordered the $7.99 3oz mixed drink, and my boyfriend got the $7.99 32 oz domestic beer (i.e. 2 pints). Not a bad deal all around.

So back to the food and service experience. We got a overly perky waitress in an outfit I can only imagine she was freezing in, considering I wore my jacket for the whole meal. -1 for a freezing restuarant. I ordered the individual-sized Spicy Garlic pizza from the healthy options menu, coming in at 650 calories and 13 grams of fat. Perfect. My non-calorie counting boyfriend got another individual sized pizza, the BBQ chicken. When the meal came to the table, both of us literally did the double take. That's it? The individual size should state 'for those 10 and under\". For $11.99, I expected a meal, not a bedtime snack, and it wasn't just because mine was a \"healthy\" choice - my boyfriend's was the same size, just cheesier. The pizza itself was ok, nothing special - I've had better slices at pizza pizza that have sat under the heatlamp for a few hours.

So -1 for the deceiving menu and horrendously over-priced pizza, as well as leaving us hungry.

Forgot the the word \"Pizza\" in this chain's name altogether, and if you must go, get the prime rib burger. The menu catchline is \"if you're going to do one thing, do it right\", and they've got that right at least. Next time I go (and I know eventually one among my friends will drag me back here), I'll check out some more of the healthy options and see if I can get something a little more filling and worth the price."}
{"text":"The food and drinks may not be the greatest but the service is always good. The bar area has a lot of TV's, great during game nights. There are two bartenders there (usually Friday and Saturday nights) that are really funny and engaging. If it weren't for the food being crappy occasionally, I'd enjoy coming here more often. But overall, I'm satisfied when I come here."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst pizza establishment I ever been too. I see alot of post about the customer service. Fortunately for us the customer service was okay nothing great. But the food was horrible greasy, topped with nasty greasy cheese. We ordered a small pizza, a philly cheesesteak, some wings, and garlic bread to share with a group of 3 of us. I was shocked to see the philly cheesesteak it's usually made with provolone. And I was shocked when I bit into it. It looked and tasted like melted sliced processed cheese. It wasn't until after I noticed they charged extra if you want provolone. Other wise your getting sliced cheese. So you should really say steak sandwich with sliced cheese not a philly cheesesteak. Also I asked the lady at the front of their ranch house made. She told me it was when it clearly it wasn't. When I tasted it; it was very sour and disgusting. Which made more mad cause if she would have just been honest from the beginning I would have never ordered the wings. The garlic bread with cheese was just as disgusting as everything else. It didn't even have a garlic flavor to it just butter with more of this nasty white cheese. And the pizza I order a combo, we basically got a cheese pizza with the amount of toppings you would get out of a frozen pizza box. I was gonna ask for my money back because all I did was pick at the food and didn't really eat. But I decided it wasn't worth my time. All around this place is just nasty with cheap ingredients. You can definitely tell. I can see how it would be good if your extremely intoxicated. Otherwise do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. *Note* I probably should of realized it when I walked in and it smelled like a Chinese food restaurant. I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is a restaurant located near Woodbine and Major Mac that offers a lot of different pasta, pizza and pretty much any bar food that you can think of.

The service can be a little inconsistent.  I've had times where the service was excellent and others where there's a little more to be desired.  The manager always walks around and I've had a few instances where he'd check up on the table to make sure everything's okay, which is greatly appreciated.  I had an instance that I went with four friends and we had three dishes that arrived cold and food took way too long to come out.  We sent the cold food back and he was the one the return with them.  He clearly cares, which makes me appreciate him that much more.  The cold food was completely the kitchen's fault for not timing the food properly and during the problematic time I went, the waitress did pretty much everything she could do to make the night enjoyable and I don't fault her at all, as I've had her multiple times.

The food ranges from average to above average.  I'm in love with their wings and a few of their other appetizers but I've had friends say that they weren't impressed.

Cost wise, while I don't remember exact figures, this place tends to be a little pricey.  Keep in mind that bar food's expensive as it is, but just know that before you decide to go there.

The atmosphere's pretty standard for any place of this type, honestly.  They've got plenty of TVs around the dining room and it's not too loud that you can't enjoy your meal and talk with whomever you're there with.

At the end of the day, I've started coming here less because it costs more than I'd want to pay but it's still worth a try if you're craving bar food and want to watch a sporting event of any sort.  They do have the odd bad night where they're super busy and the kitchen starts to screw up.  I just feel bad for the servers and the manager because they're generally really good."}
{"text":"Tonite we went to Boston Pizza nearby because August 14 today - is Customer Appreciation day at all their restaurants!  All individual pizzas normally priced around $13 was only $5!  No phone in deliveries but you could order however many if you went into the dining place!  We ordered 4 pizzas for the 2 of us and got to try the Deluxe, Hawaiian & the Cheeseburger !  All came out piping hot and fresh!  We enjoyed the various flavours and had enough to take home for lunch tomorrow or maybe later tonite ...
Waitress was so friendly and service was excellent!  Not crazy busy but I didn't see much promo advertising for this special ... only on poster if you went into the restaurant.  Will come back again for pizza"}
{"text":"Big shout out to Boston Pizza!!  Eleni and has a kick ass crew. The Best Pizza specials and the wings are the best. My partner and I work for the RTC and we visit frequently for the Outstanding food. Again those killer wings and the best ranch.. We will see you soon Eleni.. Go Steelers..
Thanks Tony"}
{"text":"After having an extremely terrible experience at Real Sports Bar, me and my friend crossed our fingers and dropped by this place.

We were greeted right away and the host was very friendly :)

We were seated quickly and we didn't even wait 10 minutes for our food which made up for our bad dinner date!

I ordered the Santa Fe Salad which was moderately priced and absolutely delicious! My friend ordered nachos and she was very pleased :) Our server was very nice and checked up on us constantly!

EVEN THE HOST CHECKED UP ON US and made us laugh a lot!

Definitely coming here again when I'm watching a game at Rogers Centre :)"}
{"text":"Im a big fan of wings, so much so that i make it a thing to get mom n pop/hole in the wall wings from any city im traveling to. Ive had wings basically all up and down the west coast from socal to pnw. Boston is easily THE go to for wings, still top of my list, when they do it right ITS RIGHT! But ofcourse were all human and sometimes the wings are a bit dry or burnt, even theyre \"off\" days are better than most other places GOOD days. 
Oh and they can be kinda \"rude\" but its just to straight forward and to the point."}
{"text":"In my mind, Boston Pizza's \"Pasta Tuesday\" (gourmet pasta dish for $10.99 every Tuesday) can't be beat! 

If you don't mind a little spice, I would definitely recommend the Jambalaya fettucine (the bottom one in the pic below). I usually love anything spicy so this dish is my favourite, but I've tried most of their pasta dishes and have yet to find one I dislike.
Plus, the portions are quite large, so I often have leftovers to take home and eat for lunch the next day when I go to work!

I can't speak for all of the food there since I haven't tried much else, aside from a few of their pizzas. But with the very chill mood and (usually) extremely friendly service, I'd definitely recommend the place for a casual date night or family dinner!"}
{"text":"So bad I am writing review from booth while still eating. The place is gloomy - scary booths, bad lighting. 

We ordered a small pizza - mushroom. The pizza is terrible- too salty and the cheese rolls off the crust when you try to pull apart. The mushrooms taste like canned mushrooms. The crust is tasteless. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.

The TVs are way too loud - surround sound with sports and commercials."}
{"text":"I had supper last night at Boston Pizza.  I've been there before and it was okay.

I sat on the bar side as there was no one on the dining room side

I ordered Chicken Parmesan with no veggies so Samira, my server, asked for extra spaghetti with Alfredo sauce for me.  The chicken was okay ... it had a herb (rosemary maybe?) that I found a bit overpowering, though.

Samira was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Boston Pizza.  It's been awhile since I've been at a Boston Pizza.

It's been years since I've had a pizza at Boston Pizza as I usually order Broken Lasagna.  Today I ordered an individual Meateor pizza with regular crust.  It was really good and filling.  I'd get it again.  Thin crust is 520 calories and regular crust is 880 calories.  

Elyse was my server.  She was friendly and chatty and took good care of me."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Boston Pizza in Oakville.  I sat in the dining room.

I ordered the Broken Lasagna (with no onions or parm).  I've had it a few times before and like it, though it's been a while since I've had it.  It was really good.  It was hot and freshly made.  There was a lot of sausage.

I suspect they were short staff because there were just a couple servers and service would have been better/more attentive."}
{"text":"After all the years I've been going to Boston Pizza, very little has changed, except they've stopped making fresh food for the most part, other than the pizza. 

The food isn't bad, per se, but it's all prepackaged frozen food, which can be had cheaper and fresher elsewhere - the quality simply doesn't justify the price. 

That being said, if you want consistent, edible food and don't mind being gouged, it's a safe bet.

For a real treat, try \"Boston's\" in the US - it's a similar but MUCH fresher menu, with far more reasonable pricing - same company too. They'd do themselves a real service bringing their US menu to Canada, and dropping the practice of charging high end restaurant prices for what amounts to a whole lot of nothing special.

Also, don't order their burgers for delivery, they're good, but they don't travel well at all."}
{"text":"Not sure why there's bad ratings here. If you like Boston Pizza, this is a good example of one. 

Friendly staff, clean, maintained washrooms, hot food, fresh salads. 

Ordered cactus cut potatoes, meat or pizza, pasta with their Rose sauce (50/50), and their Mediterranean chicken salad. Also had a starter Caesar on the side. 

All the items were served hot, food was fresh (especially important for salad ingredients) and service and timeliness of dishes was perfect. 

It's Boston Pizza folks. On par with the likes of Kelsey's, Montana's, lone Star, etc. Was the sauce on the pasta complex? No. but it wasn't greasy or artificial either. Are the pizza toppings awesome? No. but they aren't pizza pizza either. And the salads an appetizers were fresh, hot, well proportioned and tasty. 

After a night of shopping, it's a great, casual place to dine with friendly staff and no worries about food quality. Open late. Works for me."}
{"text":"It's a Boston pizza. They offer Tues pasta night $9.99. We were there this past Tues and the server was great (though it was later, she was still very engaging and came by to check on us).  Located on the North end of Avenida mall, it has ample parking out front."}
{"text":"I'm from California anyone from Los Angeles come to Las Vegas to try the spot. It was delicious especially the wings. They have a large menu and a bathroom on site. Very clean and inexpensive and friendly. I will be coming back here. Thank you."}

{"text":"Service: 1/5
Food: 3/5

When choosing this location for dinner, I was hoping that I would be having the same experience I have had at other Boston Pizzas...I was very much mistaken.  

I went here last night with my boyfriend and was extremely disappointed in the service. When we stepped inside the hostess didn't bother to greet us, and simply stared at us until we asked for a table for 2. She then handed us off to another hostess, who handed us off to our waitress.

For dinner, we ordered a pizza and a starter salad. We chose to switch out one of the pizza toppings for a different one that was the same price.  The waitress repeated our order and we thought we were set. It was not a difficult order. 

We waited a usual amount of time for our food, but when the manager brought our order, both dishes were completely wrong. He took them back and said he'd have it corrected, and put a rush on them. We hoped he would be right.

We ended up waiting for an additional 30 mins for our \"rushed\" food (them making the correct food this time).  During this time, the waitress didn't even check on us to refill drinks, apologize for the wait.... anything. 

What disappointed me the most, was that the manager didn't offer any kind of apology or discount, after we were left waiting roughly an hour for our food and for their mistakes. Considering the location of the restaurant (about 10 mins from the airport), I was expecting a little more courtesy than what we got.  

I wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"We went to Boston Pizza for dinner because it was very cold and we did not want to walk too far. We have not been here for several months, but the food and service have deteriorated greatly.

I ordered the lasagna dish. It was okay, but it was like getting a lasagna dish from Loblaws. My friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. My friend complained that the spaghetti was cold! We sent it back to be microwaved, but it was still cold. What is Boston Pizza doing! Are they making huge batches of spaghetti. Shouldn't spaghetti be made to order?

The men washroom was filthy. Shouldn't some employee be cleaning the bathroom. It seems like everybody has given up in the restaurant.

Would we go back? Never since the food is lousy and expensive."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is great! Especially before a blue jays game. Very energetic. We caught the tail end of this. 

Skylagh the hostess here totally made the experience fantastic! She sat us and checked in several times! Making the personal connection at a place that leads to repeat visits! 

The food is good...it's a chain...you kind of know what you're getting. There's a positive quality to this...as you know what to expect. It's not gourmet...but it's good. A step above pub fare...but not a Gordon Ramsey/Giada scale. 

Bathrooms could have been a little cleaner but it wasn't intolerable."}
{"text":"This is my favourite location. The dip for the cactus fries is amazing. The thai chicken bites are sooo delicious. I've had a bunch of different food here, some of the sandwiches, pizza, and pasta. It's all been good :)"}
{"text":"Everybody at this location is very friendly, and the lunch specials are really cheap at $10 each.

I got the lil dipper sandwich and the portion size was pretty big actually.

I have tried it before at a different location and it was better there. I thought the beef tasted a bit fatty and gelatinous today so i probably wouldn't try it again."}
{"text":"This location is so amazing!  Really good customer service and great food.

Had the dipper steak sandwich and it was amazing, family had the open face steak sandwich and i tried a piece and it was better then mine, definitely recommend BP

Haven't been in a while but this place is worth your time."}
{"text":"I had to come back and write an update after our experience tonight.  
Understandably, it is a Saturday night and they would be busy but we were told the wait to eat inside would be 25 minutes long minimum.  With a 6 year old in tow, that was not going to be an option so we agreed to eat outside.  At first, everything was fine.  Our waitress was polite and came in a timely fashion to give us our drinks and menus.  About 20 minutes after ordering, she came to tell us our food was next, but they didn't have the pasta my SO wanted, so he chose a different type of pasta.  When the food came, my stepson received his pasta... plain noodles with a tiny cup of meat sauce on the side.  I have never seen that before in my life.  Why are we going out to eat when we have to assemble our meals ourselves?  Then my SO who had been asked if he wanted cheesy bread, got plain garlic bread.  When she had brought us our food, we asked for a refill (at least they are free) of our beverages.  She returned with the drinks and that was the last time we saw her for almost an hour.  The table next to us who had arrived before us, got their food AFTER us and had gone in to complain several times.  One person said \"I'll just jump in the kitchen myself, this is ridiculous.\" Needless to say, they clapped when their food arrived.  Anyways, we had waited so long for her to come back to us, we didn't even want to wait for them to come up with a dessert for my stepson so we got the cookie dessert to go for him and it was a pathetic tiny cookie...  
Overall, we froze outside now that the sun had started to set because we had waited so long for our meal, the meals weren't that great and the service was... forgetful and forgettable.  Pretty crummy experience."}
{"text":"Writing a review for Boston Pizza is like writing a review for a McDonalds - but in this case that's justified by this particular location being our team' after office spot.

I think they are good for what the franchise is. Reasonably friendly and useful servers, solid - though obviously plain standard - menu.

Food quality is nothing to talk about, but it is well done and don't fail the expectations. Interior, overall feeling inside the place is totally a chain thing.

Would I invite someone specifically to try Boston Pizza? Not much more probable that I'd invite someone to McDonalds - however this particular location is a totally ok place to go, I have no problems with it."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!  

I came here with three friends and my niece and nephew after spending a whole day at Ripley's Aquarium. Beyond exhausted, they first make us wait for 10 minutes outside and we walk into an empty restaurant. 

Next, they seat us and no one came to even ask to get us water. I had to go to the bar tender to remind them about us who actually came to get our drink order. 

We order another round of drinks during our meal and the server completely forgot. 

Not impressed with the space!  Spent $115 and felt like a waste of money... Will never go back here!"}
{"text":"Did an online order on February 21st.  The driver couldn't locate our house for some reason and so the store manager called saying he'd be late with delivery.  That wasn't a problem as we appreciated the honesty.  However when the driver arrived I said 'hey how are you' and he responds by angrily telling me I gave him the wrong phone number and its my fault he is late.  I said \"well your store manager called me so clearly you had the right number.\"  He then said he called me 4 times and I didn't answer (there were no missed calls on my phone).  He then shoved the receipt in the my face to show me it was the wrong number...guess what, it was the right number!  I told him I don't mind he is late but don't lie to me and be rude to me.  I paid my bill, took my cold food and never going to order again from there.  The driver was so rude and arrogant.  When I opened the food, one pizza box was smashed against the pizza and the pasta we ordered we half opened because it must have been crushed under something.  

Store Manager you are welcome to contact me if you'd like more details about who this driver was, I can provide more details from my receipt.  It is a shame this driver represents your establishment."}
{"text":"My little sister and I had never tried Boston Pizza so we figured it's now or never. 

The place is pretty nice and cozy. There's the option of dinning or bar area. The decor is nice and well lit too. Plus their bathroom were pretty clean. 

Our server was nice and we didn't feel rush or pressured to hurry. We received our starters long before we managed to pick what we actually wanted to eat. Everything came out in a timely manner and there was no pressure to hurry and leave. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Had banderas pizza bread it was okay, food has dropped since I first started coming to BP service not so great but younger staff! Our server was okay tonight friendly!! The alcoholic drinks were terrible well at least lime margarita was! They used table salt for rim. Yuck!! Not my favourite spot!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 7:00pm on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant was relatively empty. 15 minutes after being seated, we had to flag down the manager to ask if someone could take our order. About 30 minutes after being seated, we hadn't been served our drinks, or even water.

The manager returned and apologized for the slow service, offering complimentary dessert at the end of our meal. She explained that she was busy with another customer, and hadn't noticed us sitting for 15 minutes without anyone taking our order. Frankly, I don't care why she didn't notice or that she was with another customer; we shouldn't have had to wait that long.

Finally the waitress brought our drinks, apologizing and explaining that there was only 1 bartender working.

1) Again, I don't care why. Not my problem.
2) A bartender isn't required to make tea.

Our food came out shortly afterwards. It was quite good, especially for the price. The waitress didn't return to check in on us. I think she was probably embarrassed or afraid of us, despite us being completely pleasant and reasonable and respectful (despite the terrible service). She walked by us several times without ever stopping or checking in with us throughout the entire service.

After dinner, we waited another 10+ minutes before flagging down the waitress to ask for the dessert menu. Another 15 minutes passed. Finally, we decided we'd waited long enough, flagged the waitress down for the 4th time, and asked for the bill. She didn't inquire about us not ordering desert, and the manager never followed-up.

We left feeling pretty pissed off. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"As close to relaxing in your living room as you can get.  Service is awesome...food fantastic.  Great atmosphere!! I love their healthy heart smart choices! Been here before and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OK... Bartenders seem more focused on tables with only guys or younger crowd.... 

Takes too long to get server attention in bar.  

Food?  Great!  Chef should get tip!  Server? Doesn't deserve tip.  Deliver food without utensils or napkins?  Seriously??  No table check,  and at least 5min to replace empty drink... Very poor!! 

Thumbs up to food...

Service us not what I would expect from a Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"I went here with a bunch of people from work.

Now let's be serious, Boston Pizza is a pretty standard restaurant. It's never going to be a mind-blowing culinary sensation, so I'm never going to give it 5 stars.

But our food came quickly, our server was nice (sort of had this.. \"aunt ruth\" feel to her. Rough around the edges but a real sweet lady underneath it all) and my pasta was so hot that it repeatedly burned my mouth and even made my box of leftovers glow with an eerie post-meal heat.

But I didn't care. I just shoved that penne in there like there was a fire in my stomach and the only way to put it out was mounds of penne noodles.

I liked this place, I'd go back - service was good and I got everything I'd expect from a BP's. 4 stars."}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza is located in Shawnessy, SE of Calgary.  When you walk through the doors, there are another two doors inside, one door to the lounge and one to the restaurant.  When we dine at BPs, we usually head to the lounge. 

This time around, when we visited, it was BUSY in the lounge because of the Grey Cup.  We were definitley lucky because when we walked in, we found a empty booth among the crowd of people!  

Moving on, it did take a while to get noticed, because it was quite busy but when we finally had a server, she was great!  We ordered drinks and our food didn't take too long to come.  They have a \"Naughty but Nice\" promotional menu, which this month they offer:  Butternut squash and pumpkin soup, New York strip with prawns and scallops, Tuscan pork chops with fettucini. (Just an FYI!).  I tried the butternut squash and pumpkin soup which was OK, though, I wouldn't get it again!  I didn't really get much of the pumpkin taste. Also, I had the Nachos...they're exactly what you expect from a lounge.  Spence got the buffalo chicken sandwich with caesar salad, he said it was pretty good.  I'll take his word.....

Moreover, we had room for dessert.  To get into the Christmas spirit they have the chocolate brownie with raspberry and chocolate drizzle with bits of candy cane on top.  We weren't interested in the candy cane and raspberry, so we got the regular one.  It's never a let down!  Two soft moist brownies, drizzled with caramel and chocolate with two small vanilla bean ice cream scoops, toped with whipped cream! DELISH!

All in all, BPs is mediocre food, but it's what you expect!  Its a good place to go to when you're hungry and don't know where to go.  Lots of different selections from chicken, steaks, pastas, salads, sandwiches, soups, pizza.....

We shall be back!"}
{"text":"I think it's great that you were so busy for the big Mayweather fight.   I can also appreciate that you were so full that you had no seats in the bar left.  But with no sign out front saying private event, I can't understand why the floor manager had to be so rude to my wife and I?   These one off events are great for driving ticket sales, but when you treat your regular customers like garbage I can assure you they won't come back...."}
{"text":"Two words. Drinks specials. Just amazing! As mentioned before this a place where you come to drink but not to eat. Service is great as not many people come to this location so bring along all your friends and get belligerent. Food isn't that bad but if you have to eat, grab something from the sandwiches/burger menu as they're all reasonably priced. This is my go to bar near home and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Highly uninterested staff delivering an extremely forgettable experience. The one at Dalhousie is far better."}
{"text":"Amazing ribs! Very tender, and potent sauce! The meat nearly just fell off the bones, and each one was packed, which is really good for ribs! The side dish spaghetti was awful though, I couldn't taste anything... it was a very bland sauce to which I'm starting to notice is a very popular thing to do in Quebec when a restaurant has a lot of french customers, they tend to make all their food bland as if frenchies are scared of distinct strong flavors... So I guess I can't blame this restaurant for doing that, since this is what the community likes... but at least they got their meat down to a perfect T! Which is also something I've noticed a lot in quebec-french restaurants here.(I even tried my friends spicy bacon cheese pasta ordered, she's a french-quebecer, and she found that the flavor was too spicy, but again, I could not taste ANY flavor at all! I noticed the creamy texture which was nice, except too much grease from the melted cheese. My bf and her sister tried it, and they liked it.. but again, they're all very french too. I'm not a picky eater, and will eat anything that's in front of me and not care, but when it comes to quebecer food or foreign recipes that are redesigned to feed french-quebecer customers, I just get shocked by what I'm eating! French-Q's here should stick to meats+greasy fries+gravy, cuz everything else is like cafeteria food. 

I was disappointed that I didn't get any serving of veggies with my dinner, but apparently according to the people I was with, the waitress DID ask me, but I just didn't understand her because she was speaking french very fast and I get nervous in restaurants, and I didn't notice her repeating my order to confirm. The water was very lemony, which I found to be a little strange, but was surprised they put a slice of lemon at all, because usually restaurants don't do that, but I do it at home sometimes, so it was nice to see it. 

Took over an hour for our food to be ready! Other people that arrived after us were eating before us... which normally I wouldn't care about because I know every order is different, but we were waiting a super long time, so that was weird. They had told us that the reason for the lateness was because that someone didn't show up to work today, and they didn't have any extra person to replace them, so they were all behind in the kitchen... But according to one of our friends eating with us, who knows about this restaurant, they're already known for taking a long time to bring your food, and it's usually cold because it sits on the counter in the kitchen for a long time... I had asked the waitress if they could make sure it was still warm lol they had no problem with that, so that was cool. Also because of the lateness, the hostess came to our table to apologize very politely, and told us that they will be giving us a discount off our bill. We were expecting something like 15%, but we saw that it was actually 50%!!! that was just so awesome  They were really nice about it, we could tell they felt horrible and know what is good service, just that they're struggling. If this was a random one time issue, then I would have felt no problem going back there, but since this problem is a reoccurring known one there, I'd hesitate to go back because it's not always fun to wait an hour for your food to come, unless you're actually chilling, smoking and having a 2-3 drinks or something, which is not what that place is really set up to do, but it's possible.

I feel bad for the workers there, I wish them a lot of good luck and really hope that one day they find someone that is a very good leader and can help organize everything in the kitchen so that they can have a really good functional team!

We all also found it very strange and awkward that all of the waitresses had super short mini skirts for uniforms in a FAMILY RESTAURANT. Not only did we not notice any male waiters, but those uniform skirts were way too short, the girls were having trouble bending down to work! How are they suppose to pick up anything off the floor or get something from bottom shelves? This was very disturbing to watch, and I felt so bad for all the waitresses! The short uniforms + long waiting time for food ... just sounds like there are a lot of problems in the administration level here, which is pretty bad on the owners part since this is an ongoing problem.

I feel like I'm being very generous with my 3 star rating here. The waitress and hostess were very polite, courteous, and professional, ribs were great, bathrooms were decently clean, but everything else was a major fail, and it wouldn't take much to improve the issues here. So I wish this place good luck! Anyone reading this, I hope you can recommend good workers to go there, because I feel like that location could really use the help!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service is not bad either
They offer halal chicken
Always finish off decadently with the doughcano!!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a really long time ago with a couple of friends. The service staff was really really weird. Anyway wont spill much but lets I've had one of the most weirdest serivice from this place. Their drinks were good, since it is mostly a sports bar. I'd say its just great for guys to come hang for a little time out with a beer or two with some live Habs. If youre a girl, Id suggest dont even think about a couples thing in this place as the waitresses are very touchy feely."}
{"text":"The Cajun pasta I ordered was dry so I asked for more sauce after explaining the problem. The waiter was charged me for the extra sauce."}
{"text":"Worst place I have been to eat in Canada...I can forgive terrible service which was an two hour lunch ordeal when there's no rush in the restaurant(no surprise), but add terrible food to that....never going back"}
{"text":"Bleh...I don't know why I ever bother going to chain restaurants. I'm always disappointed.

I tried one of their *new* salads. The Santa Fe. Lets just say they are VERY generous with the lettuce and acidic vinaigrette..mmmm. And insanely stingy with the guacamole, beans, and corn (you know..the things you actually want). 

Lets be clear...I LOVE a good salad. However to make an awesome salad, the lettuce to topping ratio is key.  A huge pile of salad greens soaked in vinaigrette with a few little toppings on the side is unacceptable.  And why a piece of garlic bread on the side? Doesn't even make sense. Oh ya and this cost me $14 with tax."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday afternoon. Not busy at all. So the service was pretty fast and the waitress was very attentive. 
This place is so spacious with dinning area and sports bar area. There are plenty of seats and enough TV screens to watch games. I can imagine that watching games with a big group will be pretty comfy. 
The pizza we had was a small Meteor. I like it. The crust was very crispy. A perfect amount of spicy taste. The portion may look small but enough for two people to share."}
{"text":"This will be simple.

We were pretty much here to watch a big fight. The place was practically empty, my friends and u filled up the dining area as the patio was full. Now of course we are a large of people and it took awhile to get us settled although the dining was empty the waitress and hostess looked very unorganized, no communication between the two, and we were stead the furthered from the TV.  We asked the waitress to move us and it's was like talking to air.

Their satellite kept failing so the game that we were there to watch kept getting cut off. 

Had the calamari and the bread sticks, but I would rather go to a different Boston pizza as the experience at this one was not the greatest"}
{"text":"VIBE 
I guess sports fans? Men. Always men. And people who live/work in the Yonge/Eg area. It has a Milestones vibe to it. If you're coming at lunch, expect to wait (they seemed undestaffed at lunch). The manager knew I was annoyed so he gave me an extra star on my pizza coupon. 

WE ATE 
Pepperoni pizza and nachos. The pizza was spot on. If you're looking for fancy Libretto type pizza that's DOP don't come here. This pizza is basic pizza. It's mildly greasy and has a medium sized crust. It's very tasty. The Medium is good for a group of four. 

The nachos were meh. I've had better but bonus points for big ass portions of sour cream and salsa. More restaurants need to put the condiments in ramekins. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Good enough for Boston? Maybe. But it is good enough for me."}
{"text":"We've had a few late night orders from Boston Pizza, and it always arrives within 45 minutes and tastes great! I almost gave 4 stars, but upped it to five as there is a delivery driver that is hysterical and always is a pleasure to see. I've still never been in their building, we've only used delivery - but it was pretty convenient. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Sadly, Boston Pizza is one of the better places that delivers in the area. Believe me, I've tried them all, and this is at least edible.

I ordered a build your own pasta. It was better (and considerably more expensive) than a Lean Cuisine. The delivery showed up on time, my order was correct and they packaged everything rather nicely.

Not the best, but it's the best I can do for delivery."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza place..i love the meat lovers pizza and cheesy garlic bread, for those that like toppings they are not light handed with them..every time i come to vegas its tradition to come here and take it back to whatever hotel i stay at...if you dont like it thats fine everyone can have their opinion, but it makes me smile everytime...so thank you boston pizza :)"}
{"text":"standard for Boston pizza. pasta Tuesday is awesome! 
tried their butter chicken starter pizzatizer it was good."}
{"text":"I came to this place tonight and had a meal with my parents.  AS i review the menu has changed since the last time i went..  I tried the new chicken burger spicy with fries.  Very good, i would recommend it if you like spic..  
As i was at the table i noticed BP has a new app (myBP).  this app lets you make renovation and order food and deliver.   it also has the ability to call for the host and pay from your table.  The down side to this App not many people know the whole function of the app.  I asked the manger a this place how can i add my favourite items, call the server, split the check.   the manger was not 100% since no one had asked before..  So perhaps the next person may get a response."}
{"text":"A group member suggested this place cause of the wings.  My group arrived today (aug 2 ) and had lunch!

Server was nice and kind but not very talkative.    Food ok very hot so for that i was happy!  it was very nice not too loud for a noon time!   

I would go back for a single person or a group!"}
{"text":"One of our go too places for lunch, after golf.  The food is good, typical bar food.  pizzas are good, I really like their oven roasted wings.  Tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Definitely the best gluten free pizza out there! I always look forward to eating here because of how amazing the pizza is! The extra toppings are a bit pricey, and they go a bit nuts with the cheese, but still great! If you aren't a big fan of cheese on pizza (I'm not), just ask for 1/2 cheese. 
On my last visit they forgot to add tomatoes to my pizza, but still charged for it. We let the waitress know and it was taken off the bill immediately. Overall good service, and good food. :)"}
{"text":"I came here because it was my first time to Toronto and wanted to try some Canadian based chains. I had the Tuscan Pizza and the French onion soup. The food was great however service was so so. I sat at the bar, and it wasn't too busy but it took quite a long time before someone came and to take my order. I think I sat at least 15 minutes before someone noticed me. The waitress who was working at the bar walked by me several times and even checked the guy sitting right next to me several times and some other people at the bar before she came to me. Oh well, I wasn't too upset, but just thought that service wasn't that great and I didn't really feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend to celebrate her birthday (her choice) on a Wednesday night at about 7PM. This Boston Pizza location is in the Brock Road plaza that has the Walmart and Sobeys in it, closer to the end with Sobeys. Although the parking lot always looks full, this restaurant always seems half empty - can't quite figure that one out.

We walked in and the hostess greeted us and asked where we wanted to sit (patio, bar or dining room); we picked dining room and she gave us a choice of a booth, which we asked for. A few minutes later, we sat down with menus and started to peruse. 

Odd thing, there were two \"wine\" glasses on the table that were etched with some kind of design. I think they were for some kind of promotion on alcohol but we never found out what for. Weird. Our server also never cleared them away when we both ordered water?

Neither of us were sure what we wanted so it took us a while to decide - it also took our server close to 10 minutes to approach our table and offer us drinks. Neither of us were pleased with that and when she did come over and ask for our drink order, I had to tell her we were ready to order. If you've read any of my other reviews, you probably know that having to say that is my biggest pet peeve at a restaurant. If your customers are ready to order when you come by for a drink order, either you've got regulars who eat at your restaurant all the time or you're taking too bloody long to get to the table. Here, it was the latter (as is usually the case).

We ended up ordering bandera bread to start and my friend got the chipotle cheesy mushroomy pasta thing and I went with the Chicken Ciabatta sandwich with the cactus cut potato chips. I did let the waitress know that it was my friend's birthday we were celebrating when we ordered and she made a point of acknowledging it and wishing my friend a happy birthday.

And then... another 15 minutes went by while we waited to get our water. Seriously? It takes you 15 minutes to get two glasses of water? I wasn't impressed by this point. I was even more not impressed when our Bandera Bread came out and we didn't get side plates, just a few napkins, before our server smartened up and brought some over after I ASKED for them. We also had to ask for cutlery because there'd never been any on our table. Really? That's the basics of working at a restaurant.

Onto the food - the Bandera bread was, as always, amazing. It's really simple: just pizza dough on the bottom, some kind of olive oil garlicy sauce and then cheese on top. It comes with this sort of garlicy sauce to dip in and two of us can never leave a piece on the plate. Probably one of the best appetizers to go for on the menu.

The Ciabatta Chicken sandwich was all in, a massive disappointment. I've seen other people order it and it always looks fantastic. My sandwich that was nothing special taste-wise, looked picture perfect. But this sandwich is simply chicken (which, by the way, WAS cooked to perfection, can't deny that), tomato, lettuce and garlic mayo on a bun. It was boring. SO boring - perhaps I should have expected as much but I thought something classic like that would be done well and that it would taste pretty good. I ended up picking the sandwich apart, eating most of the chicken and then the nicely grilled parts of the bun. Will never order that again and wouldn't recommend it unless you've got a picky eater or someone who doesn't like spice or anything crazy. The cactus cut potatoes were good... in the beginning. The ones that were thin were nice and crispy and great to dip in the sauce they gave me. But most of them were too thickly cut OR not cooked enough to be crispy. They folded easily and were soft... very odd - not a terrible thing but not what I was expecting.

Our server was good enough to bring my friend a dessert of choice for free (cheesecake) and she popped a candle in it as well. I was kind of hoping for the staff to do a happy birthday song like they usually do but I guess our server didn't feel like rallying the staff or just didn't bother because we didn't get that treatment - disappointing, especially when I've seen it done many times at this location (and others) before. So I sang her happy birthday on my own :)

All in, this was really a typical BP experience for me. The service was abysmal and the food was mediocre. BP has a few stand out dishes that are great but I would never EVER choose BP for myself for dinner. I WAS starting to come around before this experience but this was the last straw. The only reason I end up at BP is because friends always suggest it and I feel bad saying no since it was her birthday and her choice. After this experience, I'd say avoid this location like the plague. It wasn't busy, there was no reason for us to have such completely crappy service and the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"So clearly I've been eating at Boston Pizza a lot lately since this is my third review of a yet another BP location. BP is never my first choice but it's rather popular among my friends so I continue to go along.

This location is pretty new I think and I can tell that when the condos in the area are done being built, it's going to get really busy. We came in on a Thursday night and it was rather quiet; I actually didn't know where the hell this location was when my friend suggested we meet there.

First thing, not a fan of the design of this restaurant. We had to head up a flight of stairs to get to our table (yes, we were offered to sit in the bar but it was really loud and has those tables with the high chairs that I can't stand). I'm assuming they have an elevator somewhere because if you have mobility issues, that could cause a problem. Regardless, the actual restaurant itself is nice and new and shiny and looks pretty good overall.

We were seated in a booth right at the end of the bar, which I could have done without because the waitresses tend to stand at the end of the bar to wait for their drinks to come up and its a tad annoying when you're trying to chat. The main point to make here is that this is probably the very best place in the city to go and watch a sporting event. I swear, if I'm out for any of the playoff games, I'm coming to this location and demanding a booth. They have two TVs per booth in the area we were, so my friend had a tv to watch and i did as well, and they're not far away. The TV was directly above my head so he had a great view of his screen as I did the one right about his head. Wow... fantastical for the sports fans out there!

We ordered drinks and since they had a new menu we decided to try out some of the wings. They fell kinda short for me; they weren't crispy enough and they definitely weren't hot enough (that could have been because of the lack of crispyness though - hot and crispy wings are just it for me). I probably would try them again just to see if it was a fluker (I think that since this place is new, the kitchen hasn't really hit their stride yet). 

I ordered the Spicy Garlic Chicken Pizza and it wasn't quite as good as the other time I'd had it. Too many onions on the top of it and they almost obliterated what sauce was on the pizza. Not enough sauce and not enough toppings other than onions on it, but it did the trick and came out piping hot. I think the kitchen needs to go back to the main recipe with this one and make it to spec.

We ended up sharing the cheesecake for dessert and it was pretty good. But it was the kind of cheesecake that NEEDS sauce; I opted for caramel sauce and with the sauce, it was to die for. But I tried it without the sauce and it was kind of bland. It couldn't stand on its own, so be sure to get some yummy sauce to go on top of it.

Our server, the bartender, was pretty awesome. He's part of the reason I'm giving 4-stars (that and those wicked TVs). He had drink refills at the table before we had the time to think to ask for them and he was the right amount of attentive. We also decided that we wanted some kind of dipping sauce for our pizza which he got for us right away. 

Overall, its a Boston Pizza, so don't have expectations that are out of whack. The food is standard but the crazy amount of TVs and the great service were what hit this place home for me. I'll be back again (perhaps during a hockey game)!"}
{"text":"I brought my best friend here for her birthday lunch as she's a rather big fan of Boston Pizza. I've been slowly changing my opinions of BP as the service has gotten much better in recent past!

It was well past lunchtime so the dining room wasn't all that busy and we were seated in a nice booth. Our server was rather nice, although I got the sense that she might be new because she didn't seem totally comfortable. Oh well. I did drop the hint that it was my friend's birthday but that there was to be no singing at her request. We ordered drinks and poked around the menu.

We ended up splitting an order of potato skins (my friend's favourite) and I ended up getting one of their healthier choice pizzas (Spicy Garlic Chicken Pizza). Now I'm not usually a fan of potato skins; they end up being kind of flavorless, have too much or not enough potato and someone always skimps on the toppings. These were pretty damned good. My friend asked for the BBQ sauce on the side (apparently they either go overboard or don't put any on) and that was a good call for sure. Not a menu item I would order but I will for sure get these again. 

My pizza was delicious, I asked for multigrain crust but I don't think she put that in my order because it looked like the regular crust. No biggie because it tasted absolutely fantastical. It came out hot and the balance of flavors was pretty impressive. Sesame seeds, green onion, bbq chicken, peppers and a yummy sweet but spicy garlic sauce on it. Unfortunately when I had leftovers a day or two later, they didn't agree with me, so I won't be getting this pizza again (this has happened twice now) but it was great, so if you have a stomach that isn't bothered by a bit of spice you should be fine!

As requested, my friends' birthday dessert came out without fanfare and it was surprisingly large! Two brownies and two scoops of ice cream drizzled with chocolate and caramel. I had to help her and we couldn't finish it but I was impressed with the portion size (and man... those were some good brownies). 

Overall, pretty pleased with the service and the food quality was better than I've had at a BP in a long time. I think a good rule of thumb with BP is to stay away from most of the tomato based pastas  because they all taste like chef boyardee. It's a pizza place, get the pizza, go for the bar favourites like wings and potato skins and you shouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hit this spot up for a late-night treat however the pizza came a little crispy the edges too crispy to eat the crust :-( delivery was pretty quick for late night the price for a large was under $17 I guess I would again sometime."}
{"text":"i got on vegas at 3am hungry as fuck and this place saved me and my friends, good one !"}
{"text":"Normal franchise food. Nothing exciting and really just your typical pizza joint restaurant. Service was average, food was average, and crowd was average for a Saturday lunch. The pizza was flawless but really nothing about this restaurant stands out. They did have a giant teddy bear that gives you a hug if you walked into the middle. I would probably say that this place is a safe bet when it comes to having a good old family dinner for a weekday. They do have better $10 weekday specials."}
{"text":"Came with here with a lovely lady on two occasions.

On our first time here together, we didn't have a problem and the food was decent. We didn't expect the quality to be amazing since all Boston Pizza's are usually the same in terms of food quality. Overall, our experience was fine.

On our second time eating here, we had to look around for the hostess because there wasn't any staff to be seen. After this, a woman came over to give us seats, we believed her to be either the owner or manager. When we seat down, it took the waiter a while to come and greet us but when he did, we asked for water and told him what we wanted to order. We ordered wings as we usually do at BP's. Assume as the wings came, we never saw our waiter ever again. We were not attended to for half an hour and nobody came to refill our water. Furthermore, we had to flag down another waitress to even get the bill. We decided not to tip since our waiter did nothing but take our orders and disappear.

Truth be told, we expected better service from a white restaurant. The only time we should be flagging down waiters is in an Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually go for their Tuscan pizza. But not today! I felt like something lighter, but filling. And I found exactly that. Their quinoa burger is a smart choice on a warm summer day!"}
{"text":"I went out to Boston Pizza near Square One a few days ago and was very happy with the quality of the food and the drinks special. 

I ordered the crispy chicken wrap and it was very delicious along with a domestic beer on tap for a reasonable price. I have also had appetizers, pizzas and desserts here and have always been impressed and enjoyed them. I also enjoy how they release new promotional items at times on the menu to add some variety but sometimes wished they became permanent items on the menu!

I have dined here many times in the past few months and have always been happy with the quality of service, food and overall presentation of the food. I would definitely recommend this Boston Pizza and hope this establishment continues what they're doing. 

I would also suggest taking advantage of their specials and promotions whenever you can since they're always a great deal and this place is always great for drink specials as well."}
{"text":"4 stars means I'm just as surprised as you are!

A chain. The suburbs. Memories of Howie Mandel....These are all things that make me assume Boston Pizza is not the place for me. 

Due to teeny tiny people related to me, I found myself Boston Pizza-bound ce soir and ended up pleasantly surprised! 

Here's why:
1. Great staff! I remember when my friends in high school worked at chain restaurants. They were so keen! Same goes with Boston Pizza - none of the snarly hipster attitude we've become so accustomed to around town. Good job, young people! (I feel like my mom....)

2. GLUTEN FREE CRUST! Don't underestimate the power of chain restaurants to be on top of trends! They make individual pizzas with gluten free crust - and they do it right. I was really impressed with both the texture and taste of my mini-pizza.

3. Extremely family friendly. If you are at a table with 4 kids under 4 and some of them feel like break-dancing, that's cool. ...or so I've heard...

4. uhh...parking! A ton of it and it's free. Who knew?

5. A little of everything. Is Boston Pizza the culinary highlight of my week? No. However, they do stuff well and there is variety for picky eaters in your crowd. Sometimes, that's what's most important.

FInally, I think they do deals for sporty-type teams. If I ever improve my hand-eye coordination, I can see this being a good thing. more beer for less = win!"}
{"text":"This week we went to Boston Pizza. We went a few months ago and the food wasn't great we figured maybe it had to with the fact that they were super busy so we hadn't quite written them off the list of places to go. 

Sadly it looks like that wasn't a fluke. This week we went and we had the pleasure of being surrounded by at least 10 fruit flies during our meal. We mentioned something to the Manager who said they had strips up and they have tried to remedy it as best as they can. 

I ordered the BK Chicken salad what I ended up receiving looked like a side garden salad for 15.00.  It was about 1/4 of the salad size that I had previously received and was missing the cranberries and almonds etc. My husband ordered pasta which was ok. 

I hope they resolve the issues but we won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered via skip the dish (love that app). Food was right on time and came as ordered. Enjoyed the meal and would most definitely order again."}
{"text":"The food and service was okay, but I would never come back solely based on how loud the music is. I had to shout the entire duration of my time spent here and the people across the table still could not hear me. I don't understand how easily this problem could be fixed yet they still can't figure it out."}
{"text":"Coming to Boston pizza tonight reminded me why I don't generally go to a franchise for pizza.  

Although their Pizza is not bad but I was really turned off by biting into a couple pieces of fatty pieces of meats in my what suppose to be chicken pizza.  It was really gross. As for our Mediterranean pasta, it did not look anything like the picture in the menu.  There were ingredients missing like the artichoke which was visibly present in the picture and worst of all, the pasta was over cooked. 

The service was average, we had to ask for everything like water refill and Parmesan cheese.  The atmosphere here on games night is very loud but they offer pint specials on games night."}
{"text":"Are they high?!  No judgment, but do it on your own time... Had to talk to three idiots to place a delivery order.  Cold pizza delivered... Hardly any toppings... Thanks for the $1.50 charge for \"fresh tomatoes\" which there were hardly any of.  The worst was the crust!  Sooo yeasty tasting... Like you just drank a cheap beer!  Oh and they can't split payments... Why?  What POS system in 2015 doesn't allow you to split payment between two cards?  Even square will allow.  Just a gross experience all around.  And way over priced for the taste and quality.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"I thought that this would  be a good place to eat as I was wanting wings and they had a good selection of wings.  The reality was that the food was ok, the service was ok.  I got the steak, which admitadly was a little too much for a pizza place, but I still can't believe how dry it was.  I didn't even like the veggies.  The only thing that I liked was an appetizer of steak wrapped in bacon."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a local resteraunt off the strip.  We were tired of the big glitzy hotel dining and wanted to feel the atmosphere and taste and price of a good old fashion type of resteraunt.  Boston pizza did not disappoint my taste buds at all.  I would recommend this place to any tourist or any local.  By far the best pizza ever. Good service with a smile."}
{"text":"Yeah the area is a little run down, but in places like these there's always gems like Boston Pizza. Their pizzas are delicious! And the best part is that there open until 3:30AM, so you can come get some late night food. I definitely recommend the Meat Lovers! That's my favorite one so far!"}
{"text":"Food: 1/5
Service: 5/5
Good for sports: 3.5/5

We came here to watch the Jays ALDS Game 1 last week. We sat in the lounge and they have plenty of TVs to watch the game. Service is great, I think there was only 1 guy serving the entire lounge, with a few food runners to help out, but he was doing a really great job, considering the place was full. 

I don't go to Boston Pizza expecting amazing food, but the food at this location is particularly bad. I've always loved Boston Pizza's lasagna but this location did it differently . They use cut up sausages in their Bolognese sauce rather than ground beef and there was simply not enough sauce and cheese. The calamari was OK, nice and crispy with fried banana peppers. My half rack of ribs were fall of the bone tender but the mashed potato and veggie sides were mediocre at best. The mashed potatoes lacked seasoning and was really lumpy. The steamed vegetables were still hard and didn't seem fresh. 

Great service, great place to watch sports, but consistency is what I'm looking for when going to Boston Pizza to have my staples - this location didn't live up to that."}
{"text":"There's two sections to Boston Pizza, one that is very family oriented and the other where everyone without kids go to... the bar section. :) My experience is limited to the family area section of the resto.

People have to take into consideration going to Boston Pizza on a Saturday night in their family room.... will earn you a stay with families who'll most likely have children with them of all ages. In our case, we were a table of 12 with 4 children under 3. It was pure madness with the other tables going on but it's a family oriented area so we weren't so paranoid to annoy others. Staff properly put all the families in the same area and I did not see any adults without children anywhere in our vicinity.

I went with \"The Big Dipper\" which basically consists of a thinly sliced steak piled high on a toasted garlic-brushed bun with melted pizza mozzarella, braised onions, roasted red peppers and crispy onion straws. There's also a dip with horseradish mayo. I went with the side fries. Overall, I found my meal to be mediocre. I don't know why but it simply didn't taste all that good... the dip helped some but I don't think a Philly steak-like sandwich should require a dip to be half decent. The bread was off and the meat was overcooked of not of high quality. The fries were good but when I got them they were already somewhat cold.

Staff was competent and helpful. Refills of my root beer were done as if on queue and it was efficient. The food took quite some time but the place was VERY busy, so I understand the wait. It wasn't Jack Astors long but still notable enough to be mentioned.

I found Boston Pizza to be a very average experience that I may repeat in the future if we go out with a bunch of children in a family setting....but I'll definitely will be trying something else. I had a slice of their meat lover's pizza and it was good, so maybe I'll try that next time!"}
{"text":"We frequent this spot for lunch as it's right around the corner from my office and the lunch specials are good value. 

The service is definitely off. Not sure if it's because we have the weekday lunch staff or what, but I always feel like us being there is a major inconvenience to some of the staff. The waitresses are generally ok but there is a definite lack of sincerity and everyone seems to be annoyed with the customers. They kind of leave you alone after you order and get your meal which is ok, unless you need your bill or a water refill, then you might have to work to flag someone down. 

The restaurant is really depressing. This place can use a total makeover, the chairs and tables are old and worn. Some of the fabric in the booths are completely torn and tattered. The carpet is pretty gross and it's certainly not the cleanest looking because of this.  They have some tv's mounted on the walls for sports games, during the day it's just sports and news.

The food is ok, I've gotten a couple of items from the lunch menu, and while nothing has been outstanding, it's on par with the value. They have a number of $10 lunch deals that come with a side. I've tried the quesadilla, the lunch-sized pizza and a cajun pasta. All of them were decent, hot, and kind of what you would expect. The sides are generous, I like getting the cesar salad which is a good size and nicely dressed. They do have a stamp card which gives you a free lunch for every 5 lunches purchased, which is good because, again, we do come here once in a while for a quick lunch. The food generally comes out pretty quick, although we have waited upwards of 30 minutes to get our food. 

I would certainly not go out of my way to come here, nor recommend it to anyone, but for a quick lunch and for the cost, it's certainly worthwhile when we don't feel like driving far or spending a lot of money."}
{"text":"We stopped here for pizza after an evening at the Life is Beautiful festival last weekend.  It's not the most upscale pizza joint you've ever seen, but it's perfect for a late-night stop. I thought the food was great for the price that they charge - we got a large pizza with three toppings for like $15, and it was ready within 20 minutes.

I had called earlier considering delivery and was told the wait would be over an hour, and the lady on the phone sounded rather unfriendly.  But, when we went into the place later on, the gentleman at the counter was fast, friendly, and efficient, so I'm not going to hold it against them.  I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat or watch the big game they have a huge screen and lots of seating. They have a great menu the food is always fresh and hot, and they will make your order the way you want , always friendly staff and great people to meet makes for a good night out"}
{"text":"To start with, their name is a misnomer as the pizza is nothing like Boston style, but I get the marketing benefits. 

Their past ads for Pizza wrapped burgers got me thinking...this combination of two favourites needs a trying.

The original large sized version seems to have gone, but they currently have a sliders version. The three decent sized sliders are pretty edible despite being topped with limp lettuce and melee tomatoes (one of my peeves). Apart from that and wondering what kind/quality of beef they are using they are very filling and a nice taste combo for a treat. 

In my opinion they are more like gift wrapped meatballs.

Another thing to note are the long gaps in service (seems the bar area may get more attention on Habs game nights) and seemed to take 30 minutes for the food to come out.

PS If there was a 2.5 rating that would be more precise, since it's almost OK. 
PPS There caeser salad (for a non-authentic table side style) isn't half bad either."}
{"text":"We went here after a long day and were very hungry and tired. The wait time was 45 minutes and we had no where to sit inside while waiting. So we sat on the floor. Not sure why they wont add benches theres a lot of extra space, and it was freezing outside. We got to our table, and the waiter could've been better, it was very loud so i don't completely blame her. There was music and arcade so it was a little much. I ordered, she didn't confirm what we got, so when the pizza came it was a little wrong, still delicious, but not exactly how we ordered it. And around $2 for a ranch.. pretty ridiculous that should be included with a $30 pizza.

Good experience, but needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Got no service! We went to the dining side at 10pm and the host told us to go to the lounge for \"better service \". We wait and the waitress told us to seat by ourselves but all the available seats are dirty! We  sit at a dirty table and wait. But nobody came to serve us at all... we just left at the end"}
{"text":"We watched the MayMac fight, service was good, great decor, lots of TVs. I found the food portions to be small but overall good experience. I would go back, maybe for a Habs game with their unlimited wings"}
{"text":"Just picked up 2 16 inch cheese, asked for thin crust, no problem. $13.25, some of the best pizza I have ever had. Made them for 20 years. Good job guys, hope $2 tip was enough. Oh, buy one get one free Tuesday's."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for sports night. I absolutely love their buffalo chicken pizza. They offer  quality food, with ok portions. Though when I come here I stick to nachos or pizza anything else I feel like isn't enough. The restaurant itself is very clean, well organized, and has lots of entertainment. They have lots of tables and the staff is usually very friendly, and the manger is very friendly and outgoing too."}
{"text":"The WORST!
I went with my bf on a friday night and it wasn't too busy but started to pick up.
There was one waiter and one bartender.
The bartender was chatting at the bar w customers and having a beer with them. First negative. 
Second the waiter didn't serve anyone she was waiting on a table and for some reason wasn't bothered by any of the other seated customers.  There was probably 3 other tables with more than 3 ppl at each.
The bartender had to leave the bar and take everyone's orders and serve there food.
Which is why I cnt complain too much about wait time which was excessive. They took forever to tKe our orders Nd bring them. After 30mins we had to ask about our meals and she seemed annoyed that we even inquired.  
The other waiter just continued waking past everyone until another group of males came in to be seated. That is when she suddenly felt the urge to work.
Food was horrible ..service sucked I mean it's Friday where is your staff"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars and I am rounding up.

We had a team lunch to celebrate a number of software milestones. We came here last Friday on a fairly snowy day. It is roughly a five-minute drive from the workplace.

I ordered the bacon mac and cheese with a side order of spinach salad. The lunch special was $10. I love mac and cheese. The bacon was good. I wasn't thrilled with the onions in it. So, I tossed that off to the side.

My spinach salad was yummy. I love bacon, tomatoes, and mushrooms in it. I had to toss more onions off to the side. These ones were too raw for my liking.

The dessert platter was amazing. It had a decadent chocolate cake, a wonderful apple crumble, and a rich cheesecake with raspberry sauce. Excellent all around for $8.

The previous time I was there, I ordered the nachos. They were delicious. The portion size was large, so I had to bring back half my remaining meal home. No complaints here!

I'd come back here again. It's a good place to watch sports games. Hockey, football, and darts.

{"text":"This is the place me and my LV Fam crew usually come to eat on a tuesday night. Its 2 for 1 pizzas at around 9pm or so.  Great place to eat but to people not from vegas, the location of this place might not attract most.  

Their pizzas are okay, just average.  The interior is really crappy compared to other Boston Pizzas I've been to, so expect something different if you've been to other Boston Pizzas before.  Good appetizers and other side dishes though. When you order wings, 20 will be enough for 2 because their wings here are pretty huge.  My favorite appetizer is their fried mushroom, really goes great with the pizzas and wings.

This place is right across of the big OG strip club though which shares the same parking lot, which I use as the legend point to find this place easier because I guarantee you will miss the Boston Pizzas sign if you'v e never been here before.  But the OG sign is big and bright which is pretty hard to miss and shares the same parking spot.  So ladies, if your man is taking long to use the restroom, he might be in OG's using the restroom there."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch because I was craving Boston Pizza and it was close to the subway.
We were greeted promptly and given our choice of seating area (I like booths.) The waitress promptly took our drink order but was confused a bit. I ordered Dr Pepper because it was listed under their soft drinks, she wasn't sure if they had it. They did but it was flat when I received it. Basically it tasted of thick syrup and a bit of water. Blech! Not a huge deal though.

We received our sandwiches very quickly (were there for lunch) I ordered a beef dip with fries and gravy. To my surprise there was cold cuts on my sandwich - one layer thin! Definitely not piled high fresh roasted beef (as described int he menu) This looked like cold cuts they bought from the cooler at the local convenience store. Needless to say I was terribly disappointed because I order 6this sandwich a lot from many different places.

The service we received from our waitress was fantastic when it came to speed and not lingering. I'm surprised she didn't ask me why I barely touched my sandwich and didn't want to take it home with me. I'm sure it was plain as day that I wasn't happy with my sandwich but nothing was ever done about it. I did the customer survey and hopefully the management will contact me cause I could've gotten a better sandwich from SUBWAY! The fries and au jus sauce we yummy though.

My other issue was the washrooms. Normally not a big deal because BP usually has really nice decor and is fairly clean. This one was no exception but open loose wiring hanging out above the sinks is a fire hazard if I am not mistaken. Thankfully I had some hand sanitizer in my purse."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is the new McDonald's of restaurants. Each location has the same menu with the same selection of food, drinks and desserts. 

So, I don't have much to add here about this location except it had a good patio and the server was attentive. I had a ravioli dish and it tasted the same as the one I had back in the Boston Pizza Waterloo location."}
{"text":"Contrary to another reviewer I enjoy Boston Pizza's pasta dishes.  I've eaten the Jambalaya Pasta twice at two different locations in Canada and the Broken Lasagna once.  Also have had the Perogi Pizza once.  I like the pasta enough to have it twice on the same trip.  The Jambalaya had a kick with red chili peppers and good taste.  The pizza also had a little kick.  I even ordered for delivery twice and the time was decent."}
{"text":"The service was really good and fast. The delivery was very fast and came up to the room. Pizza was just okay, but what I expected. Wrap and fries were good."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible, it took them 20 min to ask us what would we like to drink! and that after reminding them 3 times that we need some service, then when I got mad, their manager and 3 waitresses stood there and argued between them for several min whose fault is that! They did end up giving us 10% discount for an OK food they ended up serving. I have been to multiple Boston Pizza locations and that experienced was by far the worst."}
{"text":"I had it as a 5. Rohan is still a 5, male server. Ask for him... update

But this time I saw what others were talking about... that and they got rid of their bigger steaks that were striploins(?) and now they have an 8oz NY strips(?) the price stayed the same, i wasn't impressed with the cut(?) the other seemed better?

Anyways, why the drop?! Brought all my little ones, no high chairs available? Okay, a booster is good enough but I use the high chair as an anchor and tie them down.  -1

Again the refills kept coming and always checked if all was good etc... probably the best server(Rohan) for Boston pizza...

Then the hostess?  lady server? Someone? brought 1 kids meal... are you kidding me? That pisses off the other kids... I have no clue about serving etiquette and I wouldn't even care if it was my steak, but giving 1 shark a meal started up a feeding frenzy, and they all went wild, fml... -1000

And my last kid, no fries... so he was left waiting for his, and the funny part is, my other son had fewer fries then the other 2 so it's like they tried to divide 2 portions between 3 meals failed and still had to cook fries for the fourth(and kept him waiting) blaming kitchen. -1

The service from Rohan is top notch, he's attentive and polite and came by numerous times.

The parking and location is good

The washrooms and restaurant are clean.... 

But today was a disaster from the kitchen....cluster f*ck. 

If you decide to come, ask for Rohan, he'll make your visit tolerable... 

/on the fence, good service for a headache ??
But we had a good time...."}
{"text":"Mickey Mouse size milk and juice:.. and 1.75 for a refill on the two finger shot glass...

10 fries 2 chicken fingers... 

Sorry my kid barfed when he stepped through the doors... but wow... 

I'll be banned for using the adjectives that described my visit today.

The filtered version would call the service non existent. 

Kept being reminded the milk refill isn't free, looks like the service isn't free either... waving down servers for crackers, Pepsi and milk refill, kids sundae.. 

Plenty of mix ups, food coming at odd times, dishes being cleared even though still eating.

My drunkard mom was aghast by the service that even if she had been offered a refill(yes not free) on her pint she would have turned it down.

1000 of calories ordered, but they don't sell Advil for my head ache.

Ymmv on this franchise, or maybe all bostons have gone down hill? 

$140 would have bought us a weeks worth of happy meals and a lot less disappointment.."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is bad. 

1) We just finished playing sports in the scorching heat so we asked for a pitcher of water right away. Took them 20 minutes to get it and we didn't even get glasses for it. 

2) I ordered the mushroom chicken pasta. What I got was a bunch of tasteless goop that somewhat resembled food. It had zero taste. The garlic toast on the side was the only thing that had anything for my taste-buds to do. 

3) One of the girls was not hungry so she ordered an appetizer as her meal. She got it 20 minutes after after everyone whom ordered the main course. Pretty much when everyone else was finishing, she got her appetizer. 

4) They did refill the pop a lot for us without question."}
{"text":"We got there around 3pm and the service was very nice and helpful. I am finding a disturbing trend happening on their menus however. More and more items are tasting exactly like a cheese pizza. We ordered the spring rolls and they tasted exactly like a cheese pizza! Spring rolls should not taste like any pizza! Stop turning everything into pizza, if we wanted pizza, we would have ordered pizza! Or at least just reduce your menu to 3 things, pizza, fries, pop. Stop it!

Service was nice so I give it three stars."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party. Was a very friendly and easy to find location, just off the 401.

Typical Boston Pizza place. friendly waitresses serve you many types of italian food and sandwiches. Don't bother with the healthy because they will most likely give you a very large portion. 

If you are a medium to large company in the area or a sports team looking for a place to hang out after a game repeatedly, let them know and they can probably set you up with some sort of deal."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch a game or two with friends. Cute waitresses are pleasant to talk to and make sure you keep your belly full."}
{"text":"I came in for their Pasta Tuesday special last night. 
Gourmet Pasta specials $11.99
Make your own pasta specials $8.99 

I  always get the jambalaya fettuccine.  My bf got the baked chipotle cheese penne since they no longer have his go to buffalo chicken sandwich on the menu which is upsetting. 

It's always a hit or miss at this location. But tonight was miss! When entering in we sat on the bar side of the restaurant. We didn't see our server or any staff for at least 10-15 mins. Found out there was only one server for the night; which is odd because they usually have one bartender and 2 waitress. 

When I receive my pasta it wasn't the same taste as I remember. It was more bland and had no good seasoning. My bf pasta was the same and his portion wasn't as big as mine. He ask for no mushroom but still had mushroom in his pasta and it tasted very bad. I would not recommend there baked cheese chipotle penne pasta at all!

Overall, I really do like Boston pizza when I'm with friends for a quick appetizer and drinks if I had to go since it's close to home for me. But I really don't recommend this location. Nor would I go back again for their pasta."}

Asked the young kid if he had a number for his delivery guy because something must be terribly wrong (it's about an 8 min drive).  I will not be using Boston pizza for our next delivery, only because it doesn't show up!  When I spoke to BP on the 2nd call I told them that if it was not here in 30 mins then I didn't want it...that was 45 mins ago! I'd rather order pizza 73 in the future.  Unfortunately my niece couldn't wait and was starving so ended up with pizza pops.  Really disappointed"}
{"text":"I have to give credit where credit is due and after visiting this location a 2nd time, I am upgrading it by one star to three. This time around I had a ten dollar special which featured a Caesar Salad, and personal size spicy chicken and bacon pizza.
My friend ordered bacon wrapped 'beef bites' that came with a side of thinly sliced onion rings. I really believe Boston Pizza is reading these reviews, the food this time around definitely had more of a wow factor than my previous visit!"}

Server was a rookie who looked somewhat overwhelmed.... Ordered the Jambalaya Fettuccine and Minestrone soup, a lunch combo.  Soup was good, Jambalaya was very mildly spiced, eventhough it is shown as spicy on the menu....My partner in crime ordered the Chipotle Bacon Penne and the Minestrone.... Liked both but commented that he thought the Penne was going to be a larger serving.... With so many Asian restaurants in the area it is no wonder they are slow at lunch...."}
{"text":"Eat somewhere else, ownership is not good. Badly run, not impressed.
Constant parking war with the City of Calgary employees who work in the building beside BP. Permanent visible signage is needed to who's parking spots are whose . So simple to clarify, but parking tickets seem to be handed out constantly. Parking Wars...geezzz...handle it like adults and post permanent signage or paint the areas accordingly to who's spots are whose,until then I will take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"I usually try to steer away from eateries where

 a) The decor is underwhelming if not lacking in aesthetics altogether b) you're subject to  servers randomly breaking out in song plus clapping to \"celebrate\" some poor sap's birthday  c) the dessert menu is exponentially longer than the apps menu.  I make exception however when I get the urge for artery clogging deliciousness and that's when I can't help being lured to Boston Pizza. 

My usual indulgeneces here include the Smokey Mountain Spagetti & Meatballs which is a mountainous serving of spaghetti smothered with Bolognese sauce, hearty homestyle meatballs and cheddar.  My other  favorite is the notoriously unhealthy yet masquerading as healthy Crispy Chicken Pecan Salad which is breaded chicken breast filet, toasted pecans, pizza mozzarella, cheddar, smoky bacon, chopped egg, julienne carrots and diced tomato over fresh garden greens tossed in ranch dressing. At 1170 calories it counts for a whole days worth!! 

Boston Pizza is very sports viewing friendly too, with a companion sports bar astride the restaurant with multiple large screen TV's, so I can watch say, Lebron James do insane athletic dunks and feel like at least my eyes are getting some exercise to work off the food.

I never bother with the dessert as I figure I've banked enough saturated fat for a month, good thing there is a Home Sense across the parking lot, so I can walk it off."}
{"text":"Good location. 

Its located in a not so high traffic place to have a Boston Pizza so its not so busy...which is a good thing. The service would be faster.  This place is next the dead outside of dinner hrs.

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"My group of 8 came here because of BP's $10 combo deal. I ordered the quesadilla combo which came with a garden salad (you can also choose Caesar salad, fries, or soup instead). The food itself deserves a 3/5, it was average tasting (as expected). However, the service wasn't the greatest. The waitress was very upset that I paid with a $100 bill and rudely asked me WHY I paid with that. That's the equivalent of asking someone why they're paying with a specific credit card.. it's uncalled for."}
{"text":"I love this place because they deliver or I can dine in when I need to escape. The menu is huge. And there are daily lunch specials. I will say that if you are going to order delivery (do it  around 11:15 or your lunch might not come until after 1:00 p.m.). The prices are pretty reasonable. The staff inside the restaurant have been there forever. It is a little dingy inside, but the food is good. I am a fan of their 6\" inch pizza special. I am also having a love affair with their French fries. I don't know what they do to make the fries so good (I think there might be crack in them)...but man they are tasty."}

Pitcher had a plastic insert in the middle and was told it has ice to chill the beer. We felt it's a clever way to rip you off. Please refer to the picture. We barely got three glasses out of a pitcher."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just returned from Boston Pizza, again a chain restaurant on a Friday night. Wasn't my idea of a good time, but I gave in. 

The food was nothing special. I ordered the pizza burger and my boyfriend ordered the spicy penne. The salad that accompanied my dinner had clearly been tossed long before i ever ordered it which was evidenced by the soggy heap accompanying the burger. The burger itself was just fine. His food seemed fine overall as he is fairly easily pleased flavour wise.

What stood out about the restaurant tonight was that there were employees everywhere. I counted at least 12. Which would make it seem like they would have everything under control. Actually, the opposite. People were running around like crazy, no apparent purpose. Mid meal, our waitress came by our table. She lifted my side sauce off the side plate it came out on, took the plate and left the sauce. It felt like when your mom used to say \"bring me all the plates from your room, I'm doing a load\". And suddenly it was gone, but my sauce remained. I continued eating, puzzled by my sad side sauce sans plate. 

It just felt like we were being rushed out of a normally already quick dining experience."}
{"text":"Have been here twice in the last month, which is unusual for me. But what can I say, it is close by and the family and friends don't have a very exotic taste in restaurants.

First occasion, we had a very friendly waiter, on a very busy Friday night. I ordered a simple small pizza. The food came out hot and just as ordered. He was quick to refill drinks as needed.

Second occasion, a Saturday lunch, was very quiet. There seemed to be more than enough servers available for the 4 tables in the restaurant. However, it never felt like we had their attention. Ordered a $10 lunch special of tiny pizza and salad. It was fine, nothing overly exciting."}
{"text":"Came in with a couple friends to watch Raptors/Leafs playoff games. Seats at the bar were full by the time we arrived so we opted for the lounge instead. Luckily we were seated just before the rush. 

We ordered nachos, wings, and calamari to share. Others ordered individual burgers as it was their Wednesday special ($10 for ANY burger). Food was average, typical of what you would get at any chain restaurants. Our server was attentive throughout our stay, but was pushy once the game ended. We were charged the full price of burgers instead of the promotion price. At this point I had already completed the transaction. Our server told us they \"weren't able to issue a refund\" but offered free lunch instead. 

Lunch card only valid at this location. Go figure."}
{"text":"This place sucks, ordered sliders and it tasted like crap. The meat was undercooked and the fries were garbage. Our drinks were always empty and it took the waitress nearly 15 min for a simple refill. Oh did I mention that they told us we couldn't order the \"team pitcher\" of beer because we were only 3 people? This is a bad Boston Pizza and the wait staff should be fired. I'd rather eat at McDonalds then come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Staff weren't very attentive.  Food all over the floors that wasn't cleaned up.  The food was all processed meat and cheese.  Too salty.  They skimped on the pasta sauces.  Overpriced for what you get.  Would not recommend them for pasta.  We were there because we had a gift certificate.

Overall a very bad place to eat and I don't recommend it to anybody.  The food's overpriced for what you get and very poorly prepared.  The place is dirty, too.  Very gross."}
{"text":"Salt & pepper dry ribs tasteless. No salt or cutlery on table. Steak sandwich tough, unchewable, bread dry & stale. They don't carry Worcestershire sauce. They're out of passion fruit syrup for the Daquiri. Cucumber lime cooler has no lime flavour. Black raspberry cooler sour. To think I used to like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good for pizza,  pasta,  wings & sandwiches. Warning: this location very noisy & busy with groups & families maybe cause it's on the airport strip.  Compared to the Boston Pizza on Rimrock Road, the service is very slow here and they neglect you entirely and they let the kids run wild at other tables without supervision, and then claim they can't do anything. Yes, you can! You can have a word with the parents, not let the toddlers literally run back and forth and stop and stare for long periods at other diners and disturb them from enjoying their own meals. The waiter we had on a recent occasion kept us waiting for 15 minutes before he served us, finally took our drink and food order and TOOK OFF immediately. Didn't even give us time to say HEY! WE HAVE NO CUTLERY!  Brought our drinks and TOOK OFF! Brought our wings order and TOOK OFF! Hey, we still have no cutlery or napkins, let alone wet wipes, you expect us to eat the messy wings with our fingers and nothing to wipe up the mess? After another long long wait, brings us our main dish and FINALLY brings cutlery & napkins, but still no wet wipes. Never comes back to check if everything is OK. Never comes back to refill anyone's drink. I finally in fury, after sitting being stared at for long periods by THREE unruly toddlers opposite us, go and complain to the manager. She says she will talk to the waiter. Asks if we've paid the bill yet. I say no. I thought that meant she was prepared to offer a discount, but NO.  When I see no discount on the bill, I tell the waiter (who stupidly thinks we are going to order dessert -- what, and wait another damn 15 minutes while he takes off again--NO THANKS!) I expect a discount. I wait another damn 20 minutes for the 3.92% discount. WOW : ( I have had bad service at this Airport Boston Pizza before. This is the last straw. I'm never coming back here again. I have a Boston Pizza with EXCELLENT service and no toddlers terrorizing anyone at 333 Rimrock Road. It's not as close to my home, but I've NEVER had bad service or a bad time at Rimrock BP. You've had your chance Airport BP, but you are badly staffed and badly managed. GOODBYE."}
{"text":"I would never come back to this restaurant. First of all, you don't served us old potato fries you just re-fried. And i'm not stupid! i know when fries is old just looking at the texture. It was so saggy. Then secondly, we ask for a new one because we complain that it wasn't even warm nor crispy and i would expect a new set of fries because usually that's what restaurant do and not even a word \"sorry\". How dare you people served as the same fucking one and re-fried again!!!"}
{"text":"We're a group of 12 with three kids. We were craving pizza so we decided to check out the nearest in the area. We asked for a table of 12 but the lady said it's going to be a 10-20minute wait. The 8 others (with hungry kids) decided to leave. The four remaining (me included) had a table ready upstairs. When we got there, there were so many empty tables. I don't get why there's a 10-20 minute wait when clearly, there were so many vacant tables! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Valentines day from Nova Scotia excellent food portions very relaxed homey atmosphere our waitress was exceptional  I would highly recommend the delicious desserts as well :)"}
{"text":"I am rating the service here. Each time we've visited, we have been treated with care, attentiveness and familiarity. The employees are all extremely well trained and there's a general culture of genuine caring for the customer. This could be North America's best Boston Pizza.

The food is typical Boston Pizza fare, delicious, great portions and served fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location once before during the summer with my coworkers. It was decent service at the time and close to our office so we decided to go again this time around for a coworker's birthday. I'm giving a 1 star based on the service we have all received today.

There was a total of 11 people, most arrived right at 12 PM and the rest arrived no more than 10 minutes later. At the time, the restaurant was not very busy. The server took some time to get everyone their drinks. Water was forgotten twice for a couple of people. Our orders were finally taken around 12:20 PM long after everyone got their drinks. 

While we waited, another server came out with a couple of plates. We were pretty sure neither platters belonged to anyone at our table. The server gave us a bit of attitude and tried to place down the food. It turned out the food belonged to the table next to us. The group of 7 people beside us came around 12:15 PM and they received their food around 20 minutes after ordering. Our table was still waiting and everyone was getting agitated by 12:40 PM. Most of us only had the ability to take an hour away from the office. Food started coming out around 12:45 PM. Everyone finally got their meals by 1 PM...except me. It wasn't brought out until another coworker of mine pointed out that I haven't received my food yet. The server forgot my plate completely and I did not get my food until around 1:10 PM. I ended up having to scarf down everything as fast as I could because I was supposed to be back at the office half an hour ago. I was not out til close to 1:25 PM. Half of my coworkers were still in the process of eating by the time I left the restaurant.

For lunch, I ordered one of their $10 lunch combos. With the wait that we all had to do for our food from the moment we were seated, we might as well have gone to the food court and paid for the same price but get our food immediately instead."}
{"text":"Meh! Boston Pizza I expected a lot, yes, I thought you could handle the pressure, you bottled it. The three 15\" inch pizzas we purchased were ok, just ok. The tomatoes on our pizza looked and tasted uncooked. I like my pizza toppings to gel slightly, the ones we received looked like neat photos. GIVE ME THE FILTH! That's what I want when I order junk food, don't make it posh. If I want posh pizza I'll go to a traditional Italian pizzeria and eat a thin base classic Americano.

Quite expensive and not the best, Boston Pizza you didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"If i could give negative stars I would.

Not only did they shouw no consideration for a food allergy when they had suitable accomadations. They did absolutely nothing when we found out about the entire order gone wrong.

The manager needs to be fired. Period. 
Suggesting Common sense as a requirement to manage would be Sublime. Soft skills my man. Soft skills. You are not worthy of being management.

Third the food. Considering my allergy is less severe i went ahead and ate.

My order was 
5x Order of fries 
5x orders of bacon cheeseburgers with no sesame seeds.

What i receieved 
5x orders of fries 
5x orders of double bacon burgers NO CHEESE AND SPLATTERED WITH SESAME SEEDS.

Fries were good. 
Burger aside from obvious fail?
Dry/chalky meat
Cheap \"Vegetable spring mix style\" brown lettuce.

45 dollars wasted"}
{"text":"I came here for the Tuesday Pasta Special and ordered a Spicy Sausage Arrabbiata Penne. 

The food was decent and it was $11.99 for any gourmet pasta, you can also add the salad for $2.25 which isn't bad. 

The service here is slow, even when it wasn't busy at the restaurant. It was hard to flag down a waiter to get anything. 

Again, great for specials but slow service!"}
{"text":"Not so much a review as a few tips.  They serve halal chicken options here which allows for some great options if you are looking for halal food (only chicken) but they can do baked wings, chicken breasts,  pastas, pizza etc"}
{"text":"Family loves the Classic Nachos. Kids love the Bugs Pasta. Adults love the $10 dinner specials."}
{"text":"Went to this Boston Pizza location with a sports team and group of parents. Broke our group into two pieces athletes in the restaurant and parents in the lounge.  Totally screwed up the ordering which attempted to match parent to athlete thru player numbers.  Took an extra 30 mins to sort out the bills. Food was standard Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"Cheese pizza with extra sauce is what we always get, together with fingers or wings. I have never been inside since I always wait in the car when we pick up. Good ranch too."}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I decided to go to Boston pizza after work. I was a bit skeptical because the last time I went there I had a bad experience with my food but I just went with the group. Let me start by saying the best part of our experience was our server Rhonda. She was honest, upbeat and friendly. I think they were understaffed that night as the service was kind of slow but we didn't mind. 

Now on to the food.. I ordered spinach and artichoke dip and shrimp tacos with a side of Alfredo pasta. The dip didn't taste like a typical artichoke dip, didn't really taste the artichoke. Extremely cheesy but not memorable. The shrimp tacos were a huge disappointment! I know how could you mess up tacos? Well there was no cheese, no salsa, no guacamole and no sour cream. Oh your wondering what was on it? Yeah me too, as I moved the batter shrimp to the side. Some measly pieces of lettuce and taco shell bits topped with a sauce. Worst taco I've ever had. I asked for a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. They said it would be an additional 3 dollars. I sent it back and just ate my side pasta because I didn't want to re order food. The Alfredo was so runny and bland. A child with an underdeveloped palate might like it but I didn't.  

My friend order the buffalo chicken sandwich. He said the chicken breast tasted frozen and he wouldn't order it again. The best part about the sandwich was the bread. 

My other friend created her own vegetarian pizza with Alfredo sauce. She said the pizza was dry as there was not enough sauce and the vegetables were overcooked on her pizza and crispy. 

My other friend ordered potato skins and she was satisfied with them. 

My other friend ordered hot chicken wings and cheese pizza and she was satisfied with  her order as well. I highly recommend sticking to pizza and wings. 

When my bill arrived I was charged 4.99 for the side pasta that came with the tacos. I wish I sent it back with the tacos. The last time I went to boston pizza (square one location) I found a big piece of paper towel in my nachos and the shrimp in my pasta was grey. I said I would never go back by choice after that and I still feel the same."}
{"text":"When did Boston Pizza change their recipe and start making pizza from sawdust and old shoes?  They were never great but usually made a decent pie with OK toppings and crust.  What they served us tonight was downright nasty....Pizza 73 or Papa Johns would be a step above this."}
{"text":"It's been about ten years since I've been to Boston Pizza. I tried it when they first opened and didn't really find anything special and found it overpriced.

A decade later, it's still overpriced however their menu offerings are appealing. I went back because Boston Pizza had a promotion offering free individual sized thin crust pizzas as part of their new menu. My mom and I both signed up and had to dine in to get the free pizzas. Listed at around $16 for a small, I felt like I got a great deal, it was a good experience that renewed my relationship with this restaurant.

The new thin crust pizzas have more of an artisan look to them, they use fresher and more upscale ingredients like roasted cherry tomatoes, proscuitto, feta or bocconcini cheeses and zesty sauces. These creations look like they would be served at a fancy bistro and the taste was to match.

I also got their baked seven cheese ravioli which was delicious. The bolognese sauce was flavorfully sweet and there really was tons of cheese. Served with garlic bread, it was very satisfying and exactly what I pictured. I just wish the portion was larger.

The menu is very diverse, you do not have to come here for pizza, there is a range of bar style food, all your classic appetizers like wings, nachos, calamari along with many pasta, grill and burger dishes. Most dishes are priced at $15 and up.
If you come on Tuesdays, they have a deal on \"create your own\" pasta for $8.99, speciality pastas are $11.99

You can sign up for their \"MyBP\" loyalty club online to get free food on your birthday, on anniversaries and regular promotions sent by e-mail.

This place is ideal to come with family or groups as there is a big range of food to please everyone and a friendly kids menu. The interior is spacious with a mix of tables/booths, a separate bar area and lots of outdoor seating in the summer.

As far as big chains go, I know service/food can be hit of miss but we had no issues on this Wednesday evening so I would be open to coming back."}
{"text":"I would give them zero if I could. Came here for dinner and it was sort of busy. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Our server went to every table but ours. Eventually I found a waitress who could take my order. I told her we needed a Coke and a water. She said sure, no problem. About ten minutes pass and still no drinks. By this time the crowd had died down. 

So I find our waitress and ask to talk to the manager. As I'm asking the bar tender says to me \"that's because we're out of glasses\" I'm not sure why that's problem. But it doesn't excuse our waitress literally visiting every table but ours on her route. 

Eventually the manager finally shows up with our drinks and gives us more excuses. No apology for them messing up. 

I never have to have any luck at any Boston pizza. I've already boycotted the one by my house. I will NEVER visit this location."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends after an escape room.

Boston Pizza is fairly standard no matter where you go. However, this one was super busy thus there was a delay in service. I don't blame the server because she had a lot of tables.

I had a couple beers plus a meateor pizza, small size (8 slices - 10\") which filled me up for the day. Usually recommend the meateor to everyone, especially vegans who like to eat it. (joke)

If you're in the area, it's A-OK, but there are a number of other places around the area to eat as well."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not great.  It's Boston Pizza, which used to be a good place to eat around 1995-2005, but then it started going downhill.  Portions got smaller, prices rose.  Food quality started dropping.  We have been to this Chinook location before, and we were on a rut so we didn't have another choice but to go to this restaurant, so we thought we'd give it another try.  Seating was quick, waitress took our order quickly, and food came in about 20 minutes.  Then we said a permanent goodbye to our waitress.  The restaurant was about 30% full on a busy shopping day at a busy shopping centre at about 5:30 pm.  Let that be a warning to you-- nobody else wants to eat here either.  Anyway, we paid nearly $55 for two normal sized meals (salads, an entree, a kids meal, and two pops).  Food was slightly low quality-- cooked vegetables were crunchy, spaghetti was cold, marinara sauce was flavourless, medium rare steak was rare, my wife had some fries that were basically the fry ends and mostly not actual long sticks of fries.  Eventually I had to get up and find our waitress, who was hanging out at the front desk with about six other staff laughing loudly.  They were having a great time, which contrasted sharply with the customers.  They seemed put out that we didn't wait to pay at our table, but they didn't say anything rude.  As I walked out, they said bye, but I didn't turn around, I just promised myself \"never go to Boston Pjzza again\".  Too bad Boston Pizza, you were once a find place to go to eat!  Now you feel like an overpriced, tired pub that just needs to start shuttering your doors."}
{"text":"This is your best bet for a hassle-free good dining experience in Airdrie. 

Above-average service and BP food. Surprisingly fresh and delicious salads. They seem able to handle a crowd, which is nice."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have to say that it's gone downhill...they also really need to clean/fix their bathrooms. 

We were craving some nachos and decided to come here, also for drinks as well. It took 15-20 minutes for the pitcher of beer to come and we were already halfway through the nachos before it even came. It took awhile for the server to come to check up on us to see if we got all the food and drinks... It wasn't busy so I didn't understand why it was so slow.  

Now the nachos...they were the most disappointing nachos I've ever had. These nachos were unadventurous, unsatisfying and incredibly unattractive. There was a bunch of stale tortilla chips with only a few pieces of the toppings (there was only cheese, banana peppers, tomatoes, 5 pieces of chicken and 5 large pieces of lettuce...). It's ironic because it's called BP's \"fully loaded\" nachos. 

The only good: watermelon sangria."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my cousins. It was okay. A little pricey, but the pizza tasted pretty good. Taste pretty much like all the others."}
{"text":"So I came here with a friend to watch Game 4 of the NBA finals.

We arrived right around the start of the game and there were still a lot of seating available. It's a fairly new establishment so maybe not many people know about it yet? People did slowly come in to occupy tables but it never really got that full.

The server we had, whom I will not name because I don't know if this review will help or hurt him, was friendly and sociable. My friend had ordered a serving of honey garlic chicken wings. We didn't find out until later on while just looking at the daily deals that there was a deal on wings on Wednesdays. She brought it up with the server and asked if the deal applied and he to think about what day it actually was before saying yes, and he would go make sure the wings were discounted to the deal price which was $7.99. People make mistakes and I, for one, am prone to losing track of days as well so I don't hold anything against him for that. But so that he doesn't screw up in the future or lose money for the business, he should probably be more on top of that. Otherwise, he was doing everything else right. Was pleasant, came by to refill our drinks often and made sure we were okay. Did a good job building rapport too, using basketball (of course) to create some common ground.

Anyways onto the food.
Like I mentioned above, my friend ordered a serving of wings while i ordered the pizza pocket burger thing lol. I don't remember what it's actually called but I will attach a picture to this review. Honey garlic wings were what you'd expect. I'd usually never order them myself because I find it a boring flavour. But if you like honey garlic, I'm almost certain you'd like them here. The burger pizza pocket thing was pretty good. I certainly like the concept. I ordered mine with a side of fries and i regret not getting a salad. Or at least get a side with vegetables and not potatoes because with all the meat and everything, it's a pretty heavy entree. I'm not sure if I'm a slow eater or not, but the cheese did not stay hot and melted for long enough. Maybe serving the meal and a heated plate would help with that because it would definitely help with making the second half of the pizza pocket more enjoyable. Since it's cut in half, while you're eating the first half, the second half is left open and cools down pretty quick.

Anyway, I had a much better experience at this Boston Pizza than at the Warden and Steeles location. They did try to reach out to me to talk about my bad experience but when i replied to them asking how i could assist them they stopped responding. lol

Anyways, this is a pretty new Boston Pizza and there is still lots of room for improvement, but If they keep it up, i think that can be very successful."}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza has been slipping. It wasn't the greatest Boston Pizza to begin with but they just keep heading south. Servers are mediocre at best, there apparently aren't any uniforms anymore, any stranger could walk up to your table and take your order and you would have no clue.

Anyway onto the food. Ordered the Bacon Mac and Cheese and a side for $10. Got a Cesar salad because they don't have soups after 9pm. Not gonna talk about the salad because there should be no way you can mess up a salad.

The bacon mac and cheese was decent tasting but I'm pretty sure in the past, it had much better presentation. Also for $10, I wasn't event full after eating it. The portions seemed pretty small. Maybe a good thing for a fatso like me but may I remind you that it was bacon mac and cheese anyway?"}
{"text":"I am going to preface this review with the fact that Boston Pizza in general is never a place for a stellar menu. I never look forward to going to one for cuisine. 

It's sort of that perfect place for families. The food is bland enough to please any kid's pallette and they love picking from their own menu and then getting a dessert. It's just one of those places. 

Any time I enter BP doors means either 1) this is about the only sit down place in town, 2) my kids have harassed me to go there for a while (they love it) 3) I feel absolutely indifferent to any place else right now. 

As for my dining experience that night? I ordered chicken Sirachi pizza which was hot (per other complaints here) but I think they went a little too heavy on the drizzled aioli sauce. I had to dab some of it off. 
The kids? They never complain about food there. 
As for the server, he was good. Attentive, conversational and his timing was good. 

I wouldn't shy away from this location despite the previous poor reviews."}
{"text":"Definitely a hit of miss like LZ mentioned. 

I've been here a few times since it's a convenient place to chill in groups. It has a good environment to just hang out or to watch sports on TV. But from my experience, other locations are better overall.

The server I had was great and really efficient. I would give her 5 stars alone if I could, but unfortunately Yelp only supports overall ratings.

The food was awful. I had the mushroom chicken pasta (since it was Pasta Tuesday and it was cheap), but it wasn't good. It tasted like cheap sauce I can buy from the grocery store, and the vegetables in it seems largely cut and undercooked. At least the chicken was okay. 

I like coming here for drinks, but it's definitely not my go-to place for food unless I'm looking for something sub-par"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is garbage. Went here on a Sunday evening at 7:30 p.m.  Upon arriving, the host at the front (he looked like the manager) asked us how many people and I said a table for 2. He continues on to say that the last call for food is at 8:15 p.m.  Bro.... on google and on your website it says you close at 1 a.m. on Sundays.

Anyways, we were then seated next to the kitchen and we could hear and see every conversation the waiters/waitresses had with each other.  The manager telling his staff to take out the garbage etc.  our waiter, who was serving our food, pleasantly obliged to take out the trash, but what he pleasantly did forget to do was wash his hands before serving our drinks.....did I drink this ice cold beverage? Most certainly not.

Moving on, while waiting for our food the staff seemed so rushed, cleaning up tables, picking up plates, throwing away trash  etc.

We ordered nachos, pizza and garlic shrimp pasta.  The first 2 were mediocre but the pasta...jeeez the pasta was waaaay overcooked and was so damn watery like it wasn't drained enough. Microwave some frozen shrimp, drizzle some olive oil and season it with salt and pepper and bam! That was our so called \"Garlic Shrimp Pasta\"

Oh man, never again.  Our food was totally rushed, for some reason they decided to close early, and some of the staff decided not to wash there hands after throwing the trash away.
This place does not deserve a star."}
{"text":"When I first saw that this place was coming, I was excited!  Not that I'd heard of Boston's before, but because I felt like there was a lack of good pasta/pizza places on Prospect.

So when I got there, all the food on the menu looked great, and I was thinking this could be a regular stop of mine.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited on the food.  Literally over an hour and a half.  I don't know what happened, but they ended up giving us a free dessert that night and a coupon for a free personal pizza and soft drink.

That being said, that was the ONLY reason I went back, and I still considered not doing it.

Why?  The food was absolutely terrible!  I got a generic pasta with meat and vegetables in it, and it was pretty much inedible.  I definitely could've made myself better food (and much quicker!).  The sausage was (for lack of a better word) floppy and undercooked and gross, the chicken was mushy, the pasta itself was overcooked, and the sauce wasn't great either.

When I went back, I got a pizza, which was a better choice, but not by much.

All in all, I could get better from a fast food place, and I will since I won't be coming back here ever again!"}
{"text":"We had a gift card so we figured we'd get take out from this place one day (April 6, 2013 to be exact). My husband got an entree, I got a pizza and a dessert. This place is 10 minutes from us. My husband went to pick it up. While he was on his way home, I got a call from Boston Pizza saying that they didn't put the dessert in the bag before giving it to my husband and asked that I phone him and send him back. 

I couldn't get a hold of him so when he got home I just told him to go back and get my dessert.

While he was on his way back, I took a peek at my pizza and got a whiff of some nastiness. My pizza didn't have the artichokes I ordered but anchovies instead. Now, I don't know about you but I see a pretty huge difference between artichokes and anchovies and one of them has no business being on a vegetarian pizza. I phone Boston Pizza and told them. They asked me to send the pizza back with him. I told him he already left - that I checked after he left because he went to go back for the other part that was screwed up on. Eventually, they said they'll make a new one and send it with him. 

By the time we got everything, my husbands' food was cold and it was another half hour later.

I sent a message to head office the same day (April 6) to express what happened and that overall, we naturally were not happy with the experience. It should not take that much trouble for us to just get what we ordered.

I got an auto response saying that I will get a response within 2 business days. 

On April 12 (6 days later) I finally received a response from them requesting my contact information which I included in the original message so that they could phone me in the next 24 hrs to address the situation. The email said that there was no excuse for what happened.

I responded to the email providing all of my contact information AGAIN and never heard back since. I even sent a follow-up email months later and have never heard back.

This could have been a 4 or even 5 star rating depending on how it was handled, instead we were ignored"}
{"text":"Well worth the drive to Balzac to avoid this location. Never offered pop refills unless asked and on more than one occasion the appetizer wasn't rung in or served and the order was incorrect. Definitely better service on the bar side but a little difficult to eat at when your travelling with a minor"}
{"text":"Another friend dinner at a hockey night. We are fortunate that the wait was short. BP is always one of my favourite when it comes to game night.

This night it doesn't disappoint me. The food comes fairly quick, the taste is just right. We enjoyed our night very much. 

I ordered the lemon baked salmon. The dish was delicious. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for light weight dinner."}
{"text":"Placed an order waited two hours, waited so long cancel the order. OMG.... Truly unbelievable in an acceptable."}
{"text":"We frequent this location as the drink specials are great and the food is decent. The service, however, has progressively become worse throughout the years. We came here on a Monday night, and there weren't very many people at the restaurant, but it still took us a while to get seated as there was no hostess at the front. The bartender that usually works in the bar area in the evenings always provides excellent service and is always very friendly and genuine to us. The server working in the dining area, however, acted very rude and does not make us feel welcome in the restaurant. This server gave us attitude when we asked simple questions and also stared me down and crossed her arms while I was paying I guess in efforts to intimidate me into tip higher even though it was evident that we were not satisfied. This made us very uncomfortable.

I would recommend going Boston Pizza for the great drink specials and decent food, but please try to avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"The girls here really need to tie up their hair when serving because I was served a glass of water with a piece of hair at the bottom of it. That is just gross. Already ruined my appetite. 

The service at this restaurant is really bad. Not the friendliest and also really slow despite the restaurant not being busy. It took forever before our server came to ask for our drink orders. Never offered refills until asked. 

Next, we still had a slice of pizza left on the platter and as she was asking us if we were done with everything or wanted anything packed she threw someone else's dirty tissue onto the pizza platter before we got a chance to decide if we're packing the food or not and then tried to pick it off !"}
{"text":"TLDR: Owner is an Asshole

Was a Janitorial Vendor for this Place Early 2018. The owner decided to switch vendors and now it has been 2 months since he hasnt payed me. He doesnt answer any calls or texts.

I had to resort to going in person and he tried to blame me for rust damage on the floor that was already present before I started working with him.

Long story short this guy is an asshole and if you have ever been scammed before or dealt with unfairly im sure you can sympathize and not support this guy ever again. These are the type of guys that make life miserable for small business owners.

There are atleast 10 other restaurants serving similar food within minutes of this restaurant so please do not support this place and its asshole owner"}
{"text":"Went with a group of around 8 people, we were seated almost right away since they weren't that busy. They merged a few tables together to accommodate us. I got their burger and fries, I did expect better fries but I still liked the burger. The waitress was nice and the environment was also nice."}
{"text":"The pizzas are great (thin crust Zorba is my personal fav) but anything else on that menu gets a 1 out of 10.
I used to go here with my guy friends and watch sports and have a good time.
I personally have a problem with their delivery. Every time I order from this place the delivery guy gives me an attitude and just today after ordering over $45 of food the delivery guy doesn't give my change of $50 back! after I ask him for my change he gives me a weird look and tells me he has to go back and get change from his car!!!
I mean come on. What kind of delivery person doesn't carry change with him????
I don't think I would place a delivery order with this place anymore."}
{"text":"The food quality is just alright. They have added new items to their menu recently. I tried the fish taco for the first time and though I can't say it was fantastic, it was good enough for a try. We also ordered mini burgers, which were so disgusting that we asked the waitress to return it. This place is only good if you want to go out and watch sports with a bunch of friends and just drink beer."}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza location is like most others. We came pretty late, so seating was plenty. The food was OK by Boston Pizza standards. Every time I come to Boston Pizza, the toppings are good, but the crust is bland. 3 stars only. -1 bland crust that ruins the pizza, -1 for being expensive."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Boston Pizza locations, and I found that the best food at Boston Pizza, isn't the pizza. On this visit, I went with the Chipotle Penne, a seasonal menu item. My friend and I spent our time out on the patio before a movie. The food arrived hot, and in an acceptable amount of time. Drinks were promptly refilled. Overall my experience was pretty good. They didn't seem short staffed and things looked under control. Washrooms and the rest of the restaurant looked clean and tidy. I'll come back."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few times in the past months. It's a great place to meet up with friends - last minute - for a few drinks, food, and a great time. 

Overall no complaints with this location. Personally I feel Boston Pizza has improved compared to about 5-6 years ago. I used to go often until I had various bad experiences with their food. They were inconsistent with their food items, once I got our pizza burnt, another time the pizza was half uncooked. So I gave up on BP. Until now. (Keeping in mind that was a different location) But image is key, my experience 5-6 times at one particular location reflects on BP overall! 

Anyways, I feel they have improved vastly. I have tried a few appetizers and entrees and they were good and cooked right. I have not tried their pizza since. In the summer months they open the patio, which is nice."}
{"text":"Good service.. The food is ok.. And to be a franchise is not very bad. If I only have the option of eating fast food I will go back here... If not, I would chose something better..."}
{"text":"I believe they hired a new team of people as the service was exceptional today! Both by the hostess and our server. Our server knew what she was doing and was very confident about the menu. Service definitely improved compared to my last few visits.

I had the Chicken Quesadilla today and that blew my tastebuds off my tongue! The pita was lightly toasted to a perfect crunch. On the inside, it was filled with a generous amount of chicken and sundried tomatoes. Didn't taste the other veges such as the onions as the sundried tomatoes were all I tasted... The guacamole definitely added to the overall meal. What is quesadilla without guacamole?! I chose a side of yam fries rather then regular since I'm such a sweet potato/yam lover. 

Overall, food and service was good however, I've always felt that the food here is a bit overpriced."}

Also ordered a steak sandwich which was sub par, service was great tho! I will be coming here again"}
{"text":"Whoever answered the phone is rude! She seemed like she couldn't WAIT to be fired. Anyway, the pizza is pretty good. The chicken strips are really good. Not sure that I  would order from here again because of the rude attitude."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. Our waiter was very attentive and our service was fast. Each table has a pretty good view of the televisions.
Ordered the Santa Fe salad which was a little dry. The Srirachi chicken pizza was great! Would come again."}
{"text":"The portions were big and good for the price; pretty delicious too. The service was fast and the restaurant looked nice and clean. The only thing that I have to say was a bit odd is that when I ordered and drank the ice tea, it tasted like lemonade. Over all it was good."}
{"text":"I came here last night with 4 of my friends for UFC night. We had a small booth originally seated for a max of 4 people. We were a group of 5, so the manager put an extra chair on the side of the table instead. Funny thing was that there were many seats that were avaliable for us to be seated in, instead of the small booth seats. The manager gave us attitude and refused to service us. He also mentioned I should be happy sitting on the chair placed on the end of the booth seat. Hmm... Well I wasn't happy, and the manager didn't satisfy my needs, and gave me a negative attitude. Simple things about moving to a larger table is so difficult apparently. 

I used to go to this location all the time, and now I know because of this new manager working here, I will never come back to this warden & steeles location again.

P.S.  Get rid of the new manager, clearly an inexperienced youngster holding a position that he clearly shouldn't had earned."}
{"text":"This location looks good but has no substance. Poor food ok service.  This area needs a better go to sports bar. The drink specials are decent"}
{"text":"This place was right next to my hotel. After a long day of drinking and gambling. My wife and I decided to stop here and get some food..

#1. THAT PIZZA IS DELICIOUS!! BOSTON SPECIAL!! HMMMM!!!
#2. The fries are really good as well
#3. Only reason they didn't get the 5th star....the wings were dry....SUPER dry...We ended up throwing them away....

Most definitely will be back...For the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I had their prime rib burger and my wife had the Sicilian Pizza.  Both was really bad and the burger patty tasted off."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, almost $100 in food. Came to pick it up thinking everything was there. Came home, and one of the meals were incomplete. Was missing 2 side order of fries and a chicken wings appetizer. Drove 15 minutes there, 15 mins back despite the weather."}
{"text":"The pizza was just ok -  not bad but not good.  I have heard the philly cheese steak sandwich is good, so I may give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Boston Pizza, I know something is going to go wrong. In this case, everything went wrong. 

Came here for a reserved party of 25 and the table wasn't ready on time, despite the empty restaurant. The AC was off and the slushee machines were down, mind you it was 30 degrees outside so it's kind of a big deal when all 25 of us are sticking to our seats from sweating. Our waiter, having been told the bills would be separate, not only messed up our orders, but also lost track of who ordered what without telling us or asking for clarification - he literally smacked a solo bill at the end of the night and told us he lost track halfway through the night so he just combined it all. When the food got to us, it was cold Getting drinks was a hassle as well. We ordered beers and an hour later was told they ran out. When we wanted water, we had to ask three different servers until we finally got it. If it was a busy night, this would all be more understandable but it was so dead in that restaurant. 

The best is when we talked to the manager about all this, she was deflecting the blame and yelling at us back. I'm sorry we brought you a party, it definitely won't happen again."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  

I used to think that going to Boston Pizza was a guaranteed decent meal and experience.  I have steadily seen this place deteriorate into a place I would rather not go.  Let's start with the kids meals.  I have 3 kids and the five of us went out for dinner.  Is there a world wide french fry shortage or something?  I know they were kids meals, but they number of fries was pathetic.  We complained to the waitress and she said they were a \"pre-packaged size\".  My wife's Ceasar salad was the driest thing I ever saw - we had to ask for more dressing.  Very slow to refill the drinks, just overall very disappointing.

I think next time the family goes out we will be looking for a different place to eat!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now with co-workers for lunch and had good experiences with all of them.

It's been a pretty standard Boston Pizza experience which is good so that you know what to expect. I don't know if it's just me, but I find their newest menu to be a little unruly. It could use a little trimming down in my opinion.

My only real complaint was on the last trip where they had the ceiling fans turned up so high we had to ask to turn them down or move us because the ladies were having their hair blown around like they were in a wind storm."}
{"text":"My softball team and I have come to this location a handful of times now after our games and its been a great experience every time.  The service has been top-notch and the food has been great."}
{"text":"This used to be the only BP's in the area a decade ago.  They've done some upgrades over the years but the place still shows it's age.  Never had a bad experience here.  The staff are always competent and the food is standard."}
{"text":"I honestly dislike Boston Pizza very much, but I felt for some decent delivered pizza and dessert tonight.. Halloween night.. and I got the perogi pizza, fettaccini alfredo (extra sauce) and brownies with ice cream. The pizza was very decent.. I enjoyed it.. Simple but good. The pasta was a bit bland but nothing to complain about really (salt and pepper will help). The garloc bread was really good.. the brownies.. of course you can't go wrong with brownies. I am definitely ordering for delivery again. I wouldn't personally dine in though, but for delivery pizza, why not. I recommend the pizza and brownies. Yum."}
{"text":"We are visiting from New Jersey and had an amazing experience here. Our waiter/ bartender, Henry, went above and beyond to make sure that we were taken care of. This was by far the most welcoming and personable experience we have encountered thus far on our trip. I look forward to having Henry as our waiter on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Place was completely empty and the hostess seats my family at the table right next to the commotion of the kitchen. I asked to change tables and the staff seemed offended and talked back to me in a sarcastic way. I couldn't believe the attitude the staff were pumping out. They seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves than serving customers. The place had a very bad vibe.
We walked right out and went somewhere else for dinner. Would never step foot in this Boston Pizza again.
Jim wouldn't be pleased."}
{"text":"50$ for a a small and medium pizza?! ?!?!?!?!!?!??!

 For pizza at that price level, I was expecting something no less than exceptional. But then again, chain restaurants are usually a disappointment for my diva- palettes

 Some friends that used to work at BP once told me all their ingredients are frozen out of a box. I should've trusted my instinct and ordered from pizza pizza for half the price... plus a 2 for 1 coupon for the movies.

They have really good deals on beer, plus many large TV so you never miss a goal. Great place to hang out and drink, don't come here if you expect good food... If you're drunk then dog food would taste amazing anyway... So I wouldn't recommend to eat here unless you swallow a whole pitcher before."}
{"text":"I enjoy the pizza here.

My only complaint is the staff.  Some of the RUDEST customer \"Service\" I have experienced in LV.  The young lady that works the counter should be fired and replaced.  Try and think of me as the guy THAT PAYS FOR YOUR DOORS TO STAY OPEN.

Tuesday is 2 for 1 pizza but you have to ask for it.  So don't forget."}
{"text":"A Bacon in my Caesar!

After our Bacon Fest Yelp Elite Event, I just have more urges to eat more bacon?!

Molson Canadian Caesar ($6.75) is a mix of Beer and Bacon! The 2 things that my Yelp Friend really enjoys!

My Smokey Chipotle and Lime Caesar ($6.75) has a peppered bacon too! Just be careful of the super spicy olives!

Now I don't know if I would ever drink a Classic Caesar about all these different versions. I just could not resist the tangy pickled beans and of course the BACON!

Boston Pizza bar area was packed even on a Tuesday night?! I guess I will be back for more Caesars."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

This Boston Pizza review is based on drinks and service at the bar area only.

This might be one of the best Boston Pizza I have been to. 

The setup though identical to other locations since it is basically a franchise but it does have something unique that other franchise locations does not offers.

Local Crafted Beer Falcon Ale from Stouffville Brewing Co available both in Tall Boys and Draft. Triple Bogey from Toronto in Tall Boys.

There is also daily drink specials including domestic pints for $3.99 on Sundays, Mondays and other tall boys, bottles, bucket specials.

Service here is fast and friendly as there were a few waitress working in the bar area."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst locations in Ontario, I have never ever experienced such a service like this. This place made me so unwelcome, specially with my old school friend. So we decided to leave this place it took them 10 min to sit us down we had to wait because all the tables were empty and the manager was cleaning the counter, and bar tender was eating, very unprofessional. If Jim Treliving was there everybody would have been fired everybody."}
{"text":"This Boston Pizza's location feels dated and the dining room area just feels dark and closed in.

The service here though was always good whenever I come in for a quick bite. Food is just normal Boston Pizza standard, which has always been so so.

Not a bad option to come here to catch a game or a quick drink with your friends since there are not much choices in the area."}
{"text":"What if one night 3 of your favourite teams are playing at the same time, and you just have 1 TV at home?  Maybe come to this Boston Pizza's location would have made you really happy?

With 4 TVs right at the bar area showing Raptors, Red Wings/Boston and Blue Jays games at the same time and numerous TVs around tuned into Raptors' Playoffs game, You won't miss ANYTHING!

Beers on drafts are a little boring. But if you are into Canadian or Coors, they do have a pitcher special on Game Night.

Tuesday is Pasta Night $10.99 which is not a bad deal. Seafood Linguine was meh.. 

And for me, I am just happy to drink my beer at the bar and watch my teams win!"}
{"text":"Fresh salads , great pizza , easy walk from the sandman hotel , come here often when ever I fly into Pearson . I'd post a picture of my yummy beet salad w salmon but it's all gone !!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time at around 11:00 at night, and since we were basically the only table, I can't say for how fast the service usually is. As for the food, the pizza was overpriced for the quality and taste. I honestly found Pizza Hut pizza to taste better. The spinach dip was decent, and the apple crisp was really good! I'd give the food an overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"My cousin and I had just finished a workout at the gym a couple weeks back and we were both craving chicken wings after- so we came here.

Honestly the wings were perfectly cooked. The portion of 7 wings wasn't overly generous and the sauce was too hot for my taste.

Also their service was really slow...it took nearly half an hour to get a pound of wings. yeesh

Food 3/5 Service 3/5 Decor 3/5"}
{"text":"Food is good enough but delivery is often far later than anticipated. Demand is so high that they have random people contracted to do delivery in their personal vehicles. Why not just partner with skip the dishes? Website is not user friendly."}
{"text":"There is no denying Boston pizza is probably the best chain pizza It's a bit on the pricey side but I'll pay it because I know what I'm getting and am never disappointed. The service on the other hand is beyond bad. I normally do take-out and on more then one occasion other customers have been served before me. Perhaps it was because of the color of my skin? But by now the front end staff should know me because I go so often.
Today I had to walk out on a $100 order because I sat for over 15 minutes while I watched 3 individuals walk in after me 2 got seated for dine in and another for take out. Will not be coming here again no dispite how good the pizza is"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It has some of the best chicken ever. It is always hot, fresh and ready 2 go.... I recommend ALL Las Vegas tourist to stop here. Ohhhh and its AFFORDABLE."}
{"text":"It's a Boston Pizza. It's mediocre like the other Boston Pizzas and leaves you asking that question: why do I keep ending up at places like this? If you like BPs, you'll like this one. Mediocrity ftw...?"}
{"text":"Nice spot off the beaten path of the strip. Wings are above average. It's a dive and a ideal place for tourists who like to rub elbows with the locals. Can't comment on Pizza haven't done that yet. Definitely a place I stop in if I'm in that part of town. One more plus. If you're across the street at Dino's hanging. Tell the bartender and your set up for  a barstool delivery. I've done it a couple of times. Have at it."}
{"text":"WORSTTTTT SERVICE. Went there last night after doing some Christmas shopping with a friend. Our food took 45 mins to come to the table. 6 staff stood around the bar talking for 15 mins and staring at patrons. Most tables in the bar side last night were waiting 40 mins to get their food. Not sure if their kitchen staff was MIA, but I definately won't be going back to this location! 

I live in Shawnessy, and that location is much better. They actually have their act together"}
{"text":"I can understand your server quitting, but being a manager and believing in customer service, the serverice is horrible from waiting over 10 mins before being acknowledged, then almost an hour before order was taken. Top it off with the kitchen blasting loud hard metal music. Not even once did the manager come to apologise nor offer some type of discount for the poor services."}
{"text":"OK, this was really really bad. But let's start with the good, it was clean!

Looked like it wasn't too busy so we thought we'd have a meal of appy's. The service started really good and the food arrived super quick, then we started to see why. It was like the food was sitting out and was reheated and the cactus potatoes were like 1/2 newly cooked and 1/2 old and reheated, arriving cool and rubbery - like old food.

Mentioning it to the waitress and she apologized, but when she returned with the bill, didn't feel bad enough about serving last night's food to adjust the invoice. I mean really, they're already charging like $11 for one potato.

Needing to address the issue again she went and checked with her manager who was cowering in the back somewhere I suppose, but who never showed his face, even though there was literally only two tables in the restaurant with people in them. Well I know why now!

After a wait of at least 5 minutes while the waitress cleaned tables in an empty restaurant to waiting at least as long for her to talk to the invisible manager, the waitress returned and offered $2 off for the horrible food.
That is definitely the worst $2  they spent because you can bet, they'll never see my $50 bill in there with such abysmal treatment of customers. 

The worst I've experienced ever at any Boston Pizza"}
{"text":"I always come here for nachos after the movies and had dinner here few times and I don't feel like anything to complain.

We had the BP fully loaded nachos and it was a blessing to have the nacho option for two. This deserves a 5 star when the waitress offers to add chicken (extra points for offering spicy chicken) into our nachos and the topping is fairly evenly spread throughout the nacho (not a lot of bland chips at the bottom)"}
{"text":"WOW - Things have really changed, we went one last time last night and OMG - things are so much better now. Glad we went!!!

First - If found out that they has a new owner, who is there everyday and has made drastic changes, unlike the last owner who seldom visited his own restaurant. From what I understood the old owner was never there, so that's why it was terrible also, if management doesn't care, neither will the employees. 

New kitchen manager that has cleaned up things, the food is so well made and cooked properly - I am still in shock!!!

The server we had was pleasant, knowledgeable and perfect timing.

CONGRATS, I will go again now."}
{"text":"The bar at this location is really good. 
Three stars for the restaurant. 
More often than not the food is cold/not fresh and the quality is not in line with the prices. With the pasta the sauce is really light and the chicken breast is usually over cooked. 
The servers/hostess are always great."}
{"text":"Boston pizza is great for late night eats, as they are open until about 4am everyday. They have really good pizza, and a personal with a soda is only 8 bucks. You also get to choose your topping and its included. The pizza is pretty big and filling with puffy crusts my personal favorite.

Their menu Is huge giving you the option of not only pizza but sandwichs, wings,fries and even salads. Everyone can be pleased here.

In past experiences this place is awesome for after club food as well as for people watching. The staff is usually competent and friendly. It's also funny to see them deal with the characters that come in and the like.

I think this is a great place to go and I used to frequent it when I worked on the strip. I would recommend it to people looking for a cool late night place to grab food."}
{"text":"Worse place to eat, lousy service, Unknown Huygen and very sketchy clients, hop over the street to Aldo pizza- far better service, pizza and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Server took about fifteen minutes before even taking our drink orders. I ordered wings and it was horribly small. More like pigeon wings, not chicken wings. Wings cost thirty dollars for the triple order. I ate it all by myself and was still hungry after."}
{"text":"Boston Pizza is ok if you like mediocre pizza and frozen burger patties. However, I recently had the Market Fresh Salad with chicken and it was delish. If I go back that will be the only thing I will order from now on. Good flavour, nice vinaigrette, I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but for whatever reason this was my #1 favorite pizza of anywhere - medium Pepperoni. Comes out so hot the thing will burn you if you're not careful. Thin crust, excellent simple toppings. Share this after a movie at Moviedome? The best. What a cheap date, I tell you. I mean, the best pizza you can get down heres is from Costco. But then I guess it doesn't matter now that I can't eat pizza. Sigh."}
{"text":"Delivery  said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again"}
{"text":"Always trustworthy! The lunch menu is great and really affordable. Talking about price, Boston Pizza is really a good alternative to all other fast food chain restaurant at lunch time. However, do not expect any gourmet experience. The food is fair! The location is great, close to highways 19 and 440. Easy access to these major routes.

I prefer the bar side with the opportunity to eat outside as well or enjoy sport games. This particular location at 19/440 is clean and good looking."}
{"text":"Your average chain restaurant. That sums up this Boston pizza in all honesty. None of the food was amazing or bad either. The cactus chips appetize r was probably a bit overpriced. The pizza was okay as it should be considering the high price for a small individual pizza. Food came out pretty slow so make sure you have a lot of time for the night."}
{"text":"My all time favourite pizza hang out place in calgary and there is no two ways about the quality and taste of Boston pizza's food. I am in deeply love with the lipsmacking combination of cactus cut potatoes and chipotle caesar dip. Boston pizza offers everyday deal in their menu.

Order:
Chipotle Chicken Club: Grilled Chicken breast, Bacon, Cheddar, chipotle and caesar sauce served on pizza bread with the choice of sides. Its quantity is more than enough for one person as it is quite fulfilling.

Fiesta chicken thinny crust pizza: Do try at least one pizza from their thin crust creation. This pizza was suggested by our server and it turned out so delicious. Honey citrus chicken topped with freshly grated parmesan and drizzled with avocado citrus ranch is a delicious treat for chicken lovers. 

Tuscan Pizza: In mood of having spicy pizza? Try tuscan pizza and you will totally love it with spicy chicken breast, roasted garlic and topped with marinara and fresh spinach.

Oven roasted Quesadilla: With chicken breast wrapped with sun dried tomatoes, cheddar and served with sour cream and salsa.

Quality of food and service not great."}
{"text":"So I am a Philadelphia native so I am a big fan of little hole in wall places. 
My girl had me go here on a Friday night, as she wanted wings. 

I walked into a place which brought me back home right away. 
She ordered wings and fries, and I received chicken tenders and fries with sauce on the side. 
The wings came out fabulous, she loved each piece of them. When my fingers came out they sauce was mixed, and before I could even say anything the counter guy, said hold on they messed up. They gave me the mix-up and made me a completely new batch, even though I did not ask. 
As they were filling I had to take home the mix up and the girlfriend took home some wings.  
Reheated the next day and the wings were good according to her and I tenders were above average for reheated food. 
The price was average, I would of liked to see less nickle and dime charges of things, but overall, teh quaility of the food was very good and well worth checking out. No matter if your local or a visitor, it is must place to stop by."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes to get JUST chicken fingers. $3 upcharge for fries. I have never paid so much just for 3 freaking chicken fingers?? I expected a decent amount for $10. They also charge for every topping; $1 for extra ranch; charges on refills AND have small cups so you have to get a refill unless you don't drink at all. Worst experience. I expected more."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this horrible outfit absolutely pissed.  We arrived at this location at 8:10pm looking for a table for 3.  Raptors game 6 was on so it was a full house and long wait was expected, which was fine and we waited patiently.  At about 8:50 pm,  we saw the couple who came in just before us were seated so we approached the hostess asking if we are next on the list, she said yes but lots of people are just sitting there watching the game, that's fine as long as we know we are next.  At this time there were only us and 2 other people siting in the waiting area.  Those 2 ordered takeout and got their food at around 9:05 pm. 

Around 9:10pm, a table (big enough to seat 4) was freed up and we were expecting to be seated.  All of a sudden one of the hostess came to the front and seated the two who ordered takeout with their food instead of us.  I asked the hostess how come they were seated before us and was told they were here for a long time.  I told them we were waiting for an hour already and was told almost half an hour ago that we were next but she said no.  I looked at their little book that was supposed to keep track of the waiting queue and it was a total mess, with names in random circles all over the place and no logic of order at all, it resembles a 5 year old's draw book more than anything.  Out of frustration I immediately called the store manager and asked him to clarify why we got skipped in line, without even trying to come to the front and sort things out he told me on the phone that the 2 that were seated were next in line and then put me on hold.

I tried to take a picture of their messy queue book and the hostess immediately tried to hide it, acting as if they have committed a crime.  I regularly go to Boston Pizza for over 20 years, while I have been disappointed before I have never been this pissed off by any of their stores.  I would strongly recommend everyone to try their best to avoid this outfit, there are many better choices around the area.  If they are as messy and incompetent in such simple task as keeping an organized wait list, who knows what it is like behind the scenes in the kitchen with your food."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the area, and we both wanted pasta, so we decided to come here. I usually don't expect much from any Boston Pizza location, so here it goes.. 

I got the Jambalaya fettuccine, and it was okay. The portions were really huge at this location, however I felt like it could have had more flavour into it. I literally felt like the garlic bread tasted SO good compared to the pasta (and usually this pasta is amazing).

Service was okay. Our waitress was really kind, but I felt like she could have checked up on us a bit more, but def. a bit better than some other locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Okay, I know I gave one star in my previous review for this BP, but I HAD to share my horrible experience during my recent visit. We came for lunch, and to be honest I did not want to come to this location, but I'm like fine I'll suck it up and try it because it might have changed.. boy was I wrong. 

There was hardly anyone at the restaurant, yet the service was extremely slow. The food was good, however it took forever to get only TWO dishes that were the exact same (chicken quesadilla). On top of that, there was no bartender on the bar side, so I really don't know who made the sangria I ordered, but it tasted SO watered down....

So disappointed at this location. I wouldn't come here again, but I will go to another BP. 

P.S. for dessert try the panookie, it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for dinner and drinks. My friend and I shared the chicken shawarma pizza and it was so delicious! I loved it. It was one of the newer items on the menu, and it tasted so good. 

The service was good. Our waitress was kind and attentive. However, I think she came to check up on us a bit too much, at a point it was creepy.. if you know what I mean. Other than that, I would def. come back here. Probably one of the best BP locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Not the best location I've been to. The food was good, however the manager was rude. He should be happy if people are actually coming to his restaurant to eat, he told our waiter to escort us to this table in the bar and once we sat down the fan above us made it super cold. We asked to move, the waiter was so nice and he was okay with it, however the manager wasn't? As the waiter told us to move, he came back and told us the manager said that we had to move back.. 10 minutes later he said it's fine you can sit there?! We moved about 3 times and finally got our food. Not complaining about the food, it was well done! However the staff at this location need to get it together."}
{"text":"Meh. MEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
 
I like Boston Pizza, I do.  It's a good place for people with kids, if you want to check out the game somewhere that isn't too busy, or if you want something relatively cheap to go with a pitcher of draught.

The Boston Pizza on 130th AVE se offers a pool table in the lounge, plenty of tvs, and even VLT machines for those of us who have addictive personalities.  I suggested we come here with my parents one Saturday night because, well, we needed to eat.  Old people aren't going to feed themselves.  Plus, I wanted to play some 2 on 2 pool.  

The pool table had 6 cues.  5 of them were broken.  The 1 that WASN'T BROKEN was also broken.  BUT taped up.  Fine, whatever, I ain't fancy folk.

Our server, how do I put this, seemed miserable.  Like her boyfriend just texted her and said \"Sorry, can't watch THE NOTEBOOK TONIGHT, game's on. Call you tomorrow.\"  Why was she so unhappy to see us?  My dad was wearing a shirt that said \"CIRCLE OF TRUST\" then an arrow pointing to a dot outside the circle that said \"YOU\".  We were adorable.  Guess she didn't think so.

The food was dece, I usually get the perogy pizza which is super yummy, but opted for the salad.  Guilt due to beer, story of my life.  After it was all said and done, No Smiles McGee gave us our bill and I went to go pay.  We get to the machine and she literally turns away from me to talk to her co workers.  No \"So what are you guys up to tonight?\" or \"Did you enjoy your food?\" or \"What's your ratio preference for peanut butter to jelly?\"  So I gave her less money.  There's no excuse for being bagtastic to a family on a Saturday night.

Come here for lunch, come here with the family, come here for a beer.  I'll continue to come back because I do enjoy their drink prices and availability on game night."}
{"text":"Not worth one star.. Worst dining experience ever. The only good thing was out server was nice.. Although the hour long wait for food.. And slow service means I will never enter the rest at aunt again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service....2nd bad experiences...won't be going back.

1st experience: sitting bar side and waited over 15 minutes for drink refill. No serving staff visible for around 15 minutes; called the restaurant from my cell and asked for service.

2nd bad experience....bar side again. Sat for 10 minutes before getting menus...was not asked if we wanted drinks...waitress dropped menus and ran. 15 minutes in and newly seated people were sipping drinks. A second table that came in after us put in their food order after receiving drinks. After 25 minutes, serving staff rushing past, managers walking by got up and told this same story to the manager now behind the bar....told him we are leaving. 

Walked next door to Montana's...pleased with their services.

TERRIBLE SERVICE at Rutherford & 400 Boston Pizza...we were ignored in general. This location needs a refresher course in customer service."}
{"text":"Been here many times and I'm always satisfied with the service and the food. The cheesesteak nachos is what I always get when I'm here. It's a big sized portion that can be shared among 2-3 people. 

Lots of other choices on the menu including pizza, chicken wings and a variety of pastas. 

Staff are very friendly and kind here too.  Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"We arrove in Toronto after a 6-hour car travel from Montréal, and decided to hit up this BP for dinner after a long ride. Surprisingly enough it wasn't overcrowded and we quickly took a table. The service was fast and the waiters were willing to help. 

As for the food... well... it turned out to be better than we thought judging by what seasoned folks had told. Pretty tasty.

Ribs were sorely dry, but thick slathering of barbecue sauce made it better.

The pizza is not the best in town, but overall it's good."}
{"text":"Wow, read these reviews and I am not impressed. There is some serious lack of taste buds in this town. 
Very pricy, bought a 6 pack of drinks, MEDIUM pizza and small wings and it was $50. Order the food and friend went and picked this up. 

Ok Wings were supposed to be deep fried, can you say microwaved wings? Soggy, not crispy, and they put 2 slices of old celery on it. One had turned color. 

Pizza, LMAO, Medium pizza \"serves\" 2-3 people, really maybe a few 4 year old kids. 13\" pizza is NOT a medium people and $26 for this OMG I am glad I wasn't the one picking this up. How did it taste? Sauce is sad attempt to be called Boston pizza, Boston - sue these dumb asses for making you look pathetic. 
My kids can make better food in their easy bake oven!!

This is a first and last place in my book. First and last time you'll even rob me."}
{"text":"Came home from work and was hungry and saw a flyer about this place. Win win ordered the food took a shower went there. So what can I say? The order was easy and the service was great. 

Downfall! The pizza was no flavor however its didn't stop me to go back next time, maybe it's only the pizza with no flavor who knows? However, the opening hours is great because I'm working late and this is almost next to my house win win! 

One suggestion guys a bit more flavor on the pizza would be good"}
{"text":"Had good deals on Tuesday since pasta is cheaper. I got the Garlic Shrimp Spaghetti and hate it to death. I just didn't like agliolio too much (pasta with pesto sauce/white wine). I love the Jambalaya Fettuccine though. My girlfriend had it and I'm so jealous. Big serving so pasta pretty much can be shared. Loved the side of garlic bread. Had copper moon wine but regretted to buy it in a glass when you can buy it cheaper in the liquor store. Staff is pretty cool though and friendly service. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Very hit and miss. One day the food will be delicious and wings perfect, the next day absolute garbage. There's really is no in between. Disappointing to say the least because when the food is good there's no better wings in town!"}
{"text":"Boston Pizza has been my go to place for the following:
- Late night eats
- Cheap eats on the Strip
- Pizza that tastes really good.

Unfortunately, the pizza is becoming more mediocre, the more I visit. I've had crust so hard, it was inedible, and nearly burnt. I feel that they put an insane amount of cheese on the personal pizzas, just for the sake of having a crazy amount of cheese. 

If you're getting a water and a cheese pizza, don't order the special, it's actually cheaper to buy just the personal pizza with no additional toppings and pay for your water cup. Yes, they charge you for a polystyrene cup for water. Water is the only beverage that you get a free refill on, otherwise, you have to pay upward of $.60-.85 for a refill. I don't drink soda, but I think that's ridiculous when the cost of a beverage from a fountain costs pennies. 

If the food was consistently good, I'd keep this place at 4 stars, but the last 3-4 times I've been, the pizza wasn't that good and the service was extra slow. Boo!"}
{"text":"We came in for a Beer mostly so we only had some good to share. We had spinach and artichoke dip that came with very tasty garlic bread and the dip had baked chees on top! Very tasty. We also had shrimp tacos that were really good. The only thing I didn't like was the Bloody Mary"}
{"text":"Open till 4am!  Grabbing a late night bite is What you go to boston's for.  There pizza might not be the best but really good service and some good wings/fingers for it.  Don't let the hole in the wall feel discourage you."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times when my husband craves gourmet pizza. The menu has your typical Canadian/American food. The portion sizes are super big and two people can definitely share. 
My husband got a thin crust chicken pizza with some white sauce on it. The crust was nice and thin, chicken was well cooked and they put a generous amount of sauce on it. The negative thing was that there was too much oil in it. Not only was the base covered in oil but the top of the pizza was also drenching in it. 
I order the shrimp tacos. The order came with 3 pieces of it. The shrimps were too battered and deep fried but the seasoning was good. The tortillas were over cooked so they got crunchy which I did not like, since I ordered soft tacos. There was also too much lettuce and tomatoes inside the taco. I wish they put some salsa, corn, sour cream, purple cabbage etc. in it.
I have also tried their shrimp fettuccine which is also covered in oil. But otherwise it tasted fine. 
I will probably return to try out different pizzas on the menu!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on Saturday and we had a great time. when we got there (around 3:00pm) there wasn't a lot of people there so it was quite and the waitress was really nice and accommodating. My friend and I ended up staying there for about 6 hours, so we were there when the place got busier with more families and sports fans coming in. Even though we already paid and were just talking, they didn't kick us out and let us stay there well after we paid our bill, which was nice since we were sitting in a really nice booth. 

Overall, the service was nice and friendly, and the food was really good (I had the individual perogy pizza and the chocolate explosion cheesecake , yumm!), I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"No complaints for me.  The waitress asked me if I wanted a refill and I was sorry that I didn't pay attention, and she brought me back a drink anyway and smiled.  They would rather go beyond expectations than anything else."}
{"text":"Bucketing down rain and a lightning storm, there is NO WAY I'm going out in that for lunch. So why not let someone else risk their life to bring me food? Yep, that's how I roll.

I did a quick Google search for \"pizza delivery calgary\" and my first choice doesn't open until 4pm (what?) and here I am with Boston Pizza. Easy to navigate web page and lots of choices for pizza and other items. They have their own creations and the usual classics or simply build your own. I chose the \"Rustic Italian\" which has cheddar and mozzarella, plus sausage, peppers, red onions and tomatoes. $5 delivery charge.

They said it would be 40 minutes. It turned up in 20. Awesome! Your mileage may vary.

Still hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Boston pizza on Tuesday this past week. The cool thing about Tuesdays there is it's BOGO on large pizzas, though their pizza is a little high priced it's still nice to feel like you're getting a deal. Ordered a mushroom and olive and a pepperoni and jalapeño's. They were a bit busy cause they said delivery in an hour-hour and 15mins, they got to our place within 45 minutes so that was nice. I have been wanting to try this place for a while since we live downtown (moving soon) and I have heard good things here and there. Living downtown we have good options on pizza i.e. Pizza rock, pizza lotto, and evel pie. I must say I was a little disappointed with Boston pizza the pizza was overly cheesy (and I looooove cheese) it was just too thick or that type of cheese in excess just didn't do it for me. The pizza was really greasy, I normally don't pat pizza with napkins but I had to on this one I felt like if I was going to eat it the way it was I would instantly cause a block in an artery. On to the crust, it was hard really crunchy not that good crunch that hard dense pretzel crust (hard pretzel not soft pretzel). Also, they sent us an order of fries though we didn't order fries, I asked for two sides of ranch and only received 1 side. The delivery driver said he will try and get the fries refunded for us but never heard anything back.. he also said if can't do a refund he'll get us a credit, but we are moving out of downtown shortly so probably won't eat here again.. all in all it wasn't terrible it was \"not bad\" saw reviews before ordering and most people said it wasn't bad.. right when I took my first bite I said the reviews were right \"eh not bad\" meaning very mediocre not bad but definitely nothing special."}
{"text":"Best burger ive ever had. I got the prime rib burger. The bun was different that other burgers. Delicious and actually looked like the picture. The waitress (Deanne) was really nice and got me a refill right away without me asking. Cool place."}
{"text":"A guy from a liquor store recommended this place to me a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been to this place every time I'm in Vegas. I've only tried the pizza & wings. Both are GREAT for those late night drunken munchies! Right down the street from the Stratosphere.

You can easily tell that this is where the locals go for pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery service, ordered delivery at 11:17pm and wait an hour and 30 minutes. I called for the status only to get excuses to why it wasn't delivered they I was eventually able to get a confession from the manager on duty that they deleted the order because it was too close to midnight which was the delivery cut off time. The manager was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I know I just wrote a review on this place a couple months ago (and am also the most recent review) but I'd like to update it again because something stood out to me upon revisiting about two weeks-ish ago.

I celebrated my birthday on Sunday, November 15th about 11 days ago at this BP and not only was the food great but our waitress Lulu was also really friendly. But the best part was that we brought my birthday cake into the restaurant and they immediately offered me a free dessert and to put the cake into the fridge for us. When my friends tried to arrange my dinner at the Boston Pizza location at Chinook they told them that no outside food was allowed. Lame af. The waitresses and even I believe the manager also personally came to our table to sing happy birthday to me! So you could say that this Boston Pizza is now our favorite location in Calgary and we'll be back for Christmas! If you want to go to a restaurant to eat good, casual food where the staff actually cares about giving you a good time then come here."}
{"text":"Ordered a bunch of food for delivery and when we got it we were missing a large part of our food. We called and spoke to a manager named Ricky who was very rude and combative saying he packed the order himself so there was no way he could have forgotten to pack it. He finally admitted his mistake and sent the food back out. But instead of remaking the food and sending fresh stuff they sent the stuff that they had forgotten, which had been sitting around for about an hour so when it got to us it was cold. We are very disappointed and will from now on take our business elsewhere. So thank you Ricky for ruining what could have been a great meal."}
{"text":"Great evening. Super fast service for the kids orders, the magician kept them entertained, and the food was good.

Very busy and noisy, but not more than any other chain restaurant on a Friday evening after work/school.

Ordered a 10 ounce steak, which was cooked perfectly to my order- rare."}
{"text":"Frequently visit this location on Sunday nights, and it's surprisingly busy as its located next to a movie theatre.  The staff are friendly, and the chain's menu is executed consistently.  I'm a fan of the cajun fries, and they're never too greasy."}
{"text":"really overpriced, small portions that dont taste good and the service is horrible.

look at the picture i posted... the pizza was smaller than my hand.  They charged over 10 dollars for it.... it was salty and did not taste good.  The service was slow, inattentive and borderline discriminatory.

their pecan in the salad came in large super candied clump that would break your teeth if you tried to eat it.  

The chicken parmigiana was a deep fried chicken similar to a mcchicken patty.. and the sauce was not seasoned enough.  overall just not good 

looking at all the reviews i dont see how this place is surviving."}
{"text":"Fastest Delivery I've ever had! 20minutes after I called in my order, it was at my doorstep, fresh, hot and yummy!
The double cheeseburger was very tasty and quite large.
The chicken fingers and fries were moist and just the right amount hot sauce.
Also ordered the greek salad, but I'm too full to eat! Will save for later, but it sure looks delicious.
Highly recommend if you're in the downtown area! Its worth it! I will definitely keep their number on my 'favorites' list"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a pizza place that had real greasy pizza. I read some reviews on Boston Pizza and decided we should try it out. I must say We finally found our spot. This place is amazing!! Great atmosphere REAL  They will definitely get my business again"}
{"text":"Great fun watching the UFC fight Sat night. Excellent co-worker banter, great barstaff, and awesome waitresses. She really made our night by keeping the pitchers full and also calling a cab for us. She is a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"Not great, but not bad, either. Lots of choices - pizza, chicken, steak, salads, appetizers, and desserts. We had nachos and chicken, and the nachos looked and were less appetizing than the picture on the menu, while the meat in all entrees was kind of funky. Definitely looked like bland microwave product - the taco meat was dark and semi-petrified, while the chicken was not marinated or truly grilled - looked like it was microwaved. But the place itself was clean and comfortable with dining room, bar, and patio seating. It was half full at Friday 5:30pm, which reflected the fact that lots of people were out shopping in the vicinity, but only some decided to eat so conveniently to all the shops there. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, nor would I expect to get a dish out of this world if I did go again, but it was worth what we paid ($5 for chicken, $7 for nachos - dinner, mind you) and the amount of time we saved just jetting across the parking lot from Meijer versus going somewhere else. I have a hard time finding anything to say about the place because it was mediocre in every respect. 3 stars for cleanliness, friendly and fast service, and variety, but minus two stars for quality (meat, especially) and lack of anything memorable enough for a fifth star."}
{"text":"I came here with a party of 12 for lunch, and they were pretty good with accommodating such a large group on short notice. Predictably, the food took awhile to come, but that's normal for such a large group when they try to get everyone's food out at once. 

I ordered an individual size Spicy Perogy Pizza: an inspired combination of sour cream, smoky bacon and BP's Favourite Cactus Cut Potatoes with pizza mozzarella and cheddar, topped with green onion and a generous dollop of sour cream. Honestly, the only topping I could really taste was the sour cream. It certainly was a \"generous dollop\" because it overwhelmed everything else. As well, the pizza crust was really bland. I'm a huge crust lover but even I struggled to stomach this one. 

I also got a starter size spinach salad: fresh spinach leaves tossed with poppy seed dressing and topped with sliced mushrooms, smoky bacon, diced tomato, chopped egg and crumbled feta cheese. The portion was very generous,  I could've easily been full from this for lunch. However, I thought there was too much going on with the salad... too much bacon and cheese, in particular, which really weighed down the salad. I want my salads to be refreshing, and not give me a heart attack. 

This was not the greatest meal i've had at Boston Pizza, and I probably wouldn't order the same things again."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food, because no one bothered to even seat us. No one else was waiting, and the manager and another server was just talking to each other at the cashier. Waited a few minutes and then they just walked away like we weren't there. Didn't bother with it anymore and just walked over to Ginger beef next door."}
{"text":"If you want an expensive pizza that has no toppings or flavour, Boston Pizza is perfect. I remember As a kid Boston Pizza was a real treat. Not anymore. Now it's no different then a pizza from Superstore. Sorry Superstore. Your pizza is comparable but for 1/3 the price"}
{"text":"They have a large selection of appys, entrees, pizza, salads, sandwiches.  Went for lunch on Saturday and we ordered:
 - Thai chicken slices - sweet Thai chilli sace strewn on the breaded chicken slices, sitting on a bed of crispy broken noodles and choppen green onions.
- Quesadillia - whole wheat tortillia with chicken, cheese, tomato and peppers.  Came with sour cream, salsa and I had the extra guacamole.
- Chicken Stromboli - whole wheat chicken with tomato paste, peppers, onions - looks iike an empanada.  They ran out of whole wheat dough and made it a little smaller than usual, so they knocked off 50% off the entree.  That was nice of them!
- Cajun Rice - shrimp and spicy rice - not too bad
- Teriyaki Chicken on Rice - a little too sweet, rice a little undercooked

Good for a quick bite but if you're looking for fine dining - look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Honey fried chiccen bomb AF. Make sure u mix tha hot sauce wit tha ranch for them ssmaccin a$$ fries"}
{"text":"This was not very good at all! Should have listened to the reviews. Using tomato paste  as the sauce is horrible.  Was hoping their pizza tasted just like Niagara location, and boy was I wrong!"}
{"text":"First off I love the late hours this place is open! It's the perfect spot for people living downtown that want some good take out food. 
Their pizza has some of the best cheese I've ever tasted, it stretches apart as you break away a slice like good cheese should! Definitely get the Calzones!!
They make their own marinara sauce and you can definitely taste the difference. 
Support a local business and go to Boston Pizza!"}
{"text":"Worst service humanly possible, there is a Hispanic cashier with the most nasty disrespectful attitude not willing to help you or recommend anything, simply there to be a cashier and not useful for anything else, lazy staff take their time to do everything even cook your food. Tho they do take their time with your food, don't be fooled, it's horrible and burnt and not what you expect, I promise. They are sloppy will not be patient with you when ordering and will walk around disregarding you while you wait at the register for 10 minutes, will not go over the menu with you and will give nothing but disrespectful attitude to you. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone, ever. Never have I ever received service as bad as I have here"}
{"text":"Used to come here back in 2009 and the food was great. Driving by today I decided to stop for a late lunch to kill some time with my beau ! I was extremely disappointed with my chicken Philly and wings along with zucchini chips..this was a horrible meal. Bland all the way around.. maybe they changed owners or something"}
{"text":"BPs is definitely one of my go to dinner / late night snack locations. I had a really good experience here late at night on a weeknight about a week ago. Our sever (gentleman with short blonde hair) was so pleasant and continuously checked in with us and our food came out super quickly! In general I always have positive experiences at this location but this one in particular was exceptional!"}
{"text":"You have to be careful with this location they have there till preset to auto-gratuity so when you also tip you pay twice for they same thing be warned"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Went with my kids and husband while we were getting our tires put on at Costco. It took way too long for the server to take our orders, waited forever for our food and again, took forever to clear our plates. I wouldn't complain if we were there and it was a busy time, but we got there at 5pm, the restaurant was empty and slowly began filling after we got there. People who arrived after us had their food and drinks before we got ours. Won't be going back to this establishment"}
{"text":"Went here out of necessity, and even though it was lunch time the place was dead.

The service was unbelievably slow in spite of it not being busy.  Food was . . . as expected, just BP typical. 

Don't go here unless you have the whole afternoon to waste. It'll take that long to get your drinks and food."}
{"text":"I have to say I was surprised when I looked through the reviews and there was nothing but terrible ones. My boyfriend and I often come to the landmark cinema next door and so we come to BPs because it's so close and we love it. We always go into the lounge side and have always had great food and service. Our drinks come fast and our meals or appys are always hot and come in great time. We come so often that some of the girls recognize us and come to the table asking if we want our usual drinks lol. They're always so friendly and fast and we love it here! 

We ended up in a Boston pizza in BC a while back and had such bad service and food that we talked about how we missed this country hills location and it's great staff haha. This place is always my favourite go-to!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this location. They have cut down on portion sizes, big time which is annoying. Their chocolate explosion cake is ridiculous...its so yummy. I always get a slice (sliver now) with my meal. The waitresses that I have had have always been friendly. It's just the food tastes rubbery and fake. Not fresh at all. Blah on the food quality"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to Boston Pizza. I have been going there since I was a kid. That said, we went there for the Nachos and some pasta. The service was slow and the food was below acceptable. The price seems to be going up and the food quality going down. It wasn't terrible, it just seems like they are struggling a bit with getting things right. I will give them another chance, but perhaps just pizza next time."}
{"text":"Out of all the Boston Pizzas I've been to, this location is the best one! The manager and staff are so kind and really look after you. They're always at your service. The quality of food is also much better (fresh), and the portions are larger! A great thing about this place is that almost everything on their menu containing chicken can be ordered halal. Lastly it's very spacious in here."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best spinach pizza in Vegas! Add mushrooms and if nick is on duty tell him Gary sent you.. Yum!"}
{"text":"Brutal - avoid

Sat - 1:00 pm - 3 tables with customers - 4 waitresses - 10 minutes til ' drinks arrived - 25 minutes for food to arrive - this just sucks big time!!!! Staff wandering around like they where all stoned, BP - big problems!!!"}
{"text":"If I had the option of selecting no stars this is what the place would get . 
Ordered dinner from here, called to add something but was told delivery guy left which was ok. Waited over an hour and a half for it never showed up. Called Eden the boy who answered the phone said delivery guy called which he never did. Offered to redeliver my food but I had to pay for delivery again( which I was not going to pay ) never revived the call at all!!! Ask to speak to the manger ..... Manager on duty says this happens every time with my # but I haven't ordered from Boston pizza in forever. These 2 staff members obviously don't give a crap about any customer service. Ended up ordering our food at another place , somewhere they appreciate the business."}
{"text":"Awful    Came here as a last resort because we really wanted pizza and couldn't find anything else that was open.   The service here is beyond slow.  But let's get to it already then...  the food is just awful !   The pizza had a very weird taste to it and none of us could finish eating it.   I seriously think the cheese was bad or something because hours late ALL of us started cramping and fighting over the bathroom.    Avoid avoid avoid"}
{"text":"Great food at a good value . Good customer service as well . The speed of service was on point and the food came out hot and fresh . I would recommend to friends and family . The location is good as well only minutes away from the main Las Vegas Strip ."}
{"text":"There's a burger served inside a pepperoni pizza! 'Nuff said!!

Actually all the food here is good.  They cater well for children, and their burgers are delicious. Will definitely be back.
Our waitress was attentive and friendly, and could sense the eagerness of our son to eat immediately, so arranged for the kids' food to be brought out asap.
They have kids' entertainment in a small pizza box, that contains a number of games and crayons to keep them entertained. Both my kids thought this was excellent, and better than other restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped by before a Jays game for a bite to eat. Beers were about $6 a pint, which is typical for this part of Toronto. I ordered a chicken stromboli. It was below par, but edible. The chicken was bland and had little flavour, and the crust was cooked too crispy. To be fair, the sun-dried tomato vinaigrette was very flavourful, and worked well with the house salad. 

I was sat at the bar, and the server was very friendly and attentive.
I would go back for a beer, and maybe try something else to eat, but overall I was disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"We went last night because it's close by it was busy when we arrived but there were several tables and booths open, the hostess who we later found out was the manager Lorraine was extremely rude.  She told us there were a wait list, we asked her were all the people were waiting considering there was no one there In front of us. She rolled her eyes and with a huge attitude said \"everyone is in the washroom\" lol 
Then immediately after us asking her name she took us too one of the 7 open tables 
Our server Chelsea was amazing and courteous, I had the butter chicken fettuccine which was mediocre but better then most things iv had here. My hubby had steak and fries which he said was decent.
Boston pizza is never great but it does the trick if u want to watch sports have a cold beer and a bite to eat
The manager here should take a lesson in customer service from her servers"}
{"text":"First time I went here? The food was terrific. Best cheesesteak sandwich since I left Philly. 2nd time I went? It was 2 for Tuesday. Where they run specials. BAD idea. They were so busy, they didn't pay attention to what they were doing. And because of that,  BOTH my cheesesteak sandwich and calazone were burned. Not toasted but burned. I didn't check my food until I got home. The last time? Today? I placed my order and waited and waited and waited. Then looked at my receipt? They didn't even get the order right. I wasn't going to bother reordering and waiting more. I just left and left the food there as well. Won't be going back. Service and quality of food just way too inconsistent. 2 bad experiences out of 3? Just isn't good."}
{"text":"My favorite go to restaurant in Oakville, Boston Pizza offers a huge menu and full bar. Unfortunately I always get the same thing -- Mediterranean Pizza (without artichokes, add Jalepeno). It's just so good that I can't choose something else. Not a problem though, because my colleagues and friends can always choose something new :)"}
{"text":"Nous y avons été. Mardi soir service très lent.. Les enfants avaient reçu leur repas et 15 minutes plus tard moi et ma conjointe n'avions toujours pas été servi.. J'avais commandé le spaghetti Ricky mountain.. Il manquait de sauce j'avais plus de pâtes blanche aucun parmesan et la serveuse n'est jamais venu nous revoir pour vérifier si tout était. Correct.. Expérience très décevante"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! The pizza is probably as good as it gets. The customer service is wonderful, everyone is so nice. Husband and I come here all the time!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of Boston Pizza, too many screw ups, underwhelming food, poor service and just having had too many issues as a whole with this franchise makes going here more of a chore than an enjoyable dining experience.

We ended up here after shopping in the area last weekend as the couple that was with us had kids and this place was their choice.  First off it looks like there were some new menu items and an update was long overdue, so kudos on that.  1 star.  Also, the kids seem to like this place and they do offer a few decent choices for kids at a reduced rate on Sunday so for that, you receive another star.

Where this location loses points is the waitress, and the food quality.  Our waitress was MIA for most of the night, in fact, she was overtly catering to a table of men drinking in the corner (rolling eyes) we were not drinking for obvious reasons and had asked on 2 occasions for refills on pop, which she never re-filled.  One of our friends asked for ketchup that she never brought, it was a floor manager that ended up bringing said refills and ketchup, whilst our waitress was still no where to be found. I ordered a salad, I don't remember much about it as it was pretty unremarkable for $18 but it had canned peaches some nuts and feta cheese.

She finally showed up well after we were part way through our meals to ask how things were and never showed up again till it was time to pay the bill.  

3 STARS LOST for the auto gratuity of 18% on the bill. Now, I am generally a very generous tipper when wait staff offer exceptional service, when service is less than stellar, the tip will reflect that.  The worst part is that we tipped her 15% to the already added 18% gratuity!  Never was it mentioned that there is this auto tip and in all honesty, she didn't even deserve the standard 15%.  Makes sense why she never went out of her way to take care of us when an auto tip was imminent.

Done with this place."}
{"text":"I totally forgot how bad Boston Pizza was till my neighbour told me she went, unfortunately, had I known I would have done everything in my power to prevent her from setting foot in this place. 

It was about a year ago, when I last \"dined\" here, it still brings back bad memories, in fact my stomach is churning as I type. I have been back since, but only in the lounge for drinks. 

I went with my good friend for a late lunch here and later deeply regretted it, really we should have gone to Subway, just next door. I was starving and ordered this Alfredo chicken concoction that is no longer on the menu, rightfully so. It was supposed to be a grilled chicken breast with a creamy Alfredo sauce and mushrooms on top with your choice of side. I chose the pasta. 

The \"meal\" came with a starter salad with their signature raspberry vinaigrette. Disgusting. The lettuce was mostly wilted, too much dressing, dressing was too sweet and really nothing special, obviously something out of a bottle, and not made in house. The chicken was definitely precooked due to its rubbery texture and the creamy Alfredo was a flour based roux that tasted like dough. It was an attempt at fooling people with somewhat sophisticated pallets into thinking they were getting an Alfredo sauce but a dismal failure indeed. There were no mushrooms and the only redeeming quality to this entire dish was the pasta, simple spaghetti in a tomato sauce topped with some parm, you really can't screw that up even if you tried. 

First bite, the entire chicken portion was cold and the sauce on top was not even heated! The chicken had absolutely no flavour, it was just grilled as is, no spice, oil, salt, nothing. I guess they were hoping their \"Alfredo\" would save this disaster. Needless-to-say I never finished the meal...I had the spaghetti and a bite of the evil chicken and that was the end of it, or so I thought. 

About midnight that same evening, something was not sitting so well, I did have a feeling it might have been the mystery chicken...and I was right, it all came back out! I was hugging the toilet all night!!!! Thanks BP for an experience I will never forget. 

It makes me wonder what these marketing wizards were thinking when they came up with the initial slogan of \"Come and get it all, at Boston Pizza.\" I'm sorry, come and get what? A severe case of diarrhea? Did these people not ever eat here? Perhaps some did and decided on a new slogan, \"You're among friends at Boston Pizza\" REALLY? Would these be the same friends that told you to come and get it all? These people are obviously not your friends...unless you enjoy a nice violent case of gut rot, loose 'em! 


EWE!"}
{"text":"We came here last not watch the Jays game ! Yes, they lost.. I don't want to talk about it :( 
Anyway! There were some great things and some really bad things about our experience... 
 
The good: we picked this location because it is well located. Just off highway 404 in Aurora, very easy to get to. They are located in a large plaza so there is a tone of parking as well! The place wasn't busy (that was a surprise... or an indication), we were happy because we got a good seat to watch the game! Our server / bartender was great overall, very friendly, attentive; zero complaints about him. Lastly, their beer selection (in my opinion) was excellent as well! They just got blue moon on tap! Between that and Stella... I could be there drinking all night! 

The bad: towards the end of the night our server changed... I guess his shift was done. That in itself is completely understandable... unless the new bartender is not so great! Long story short I had to ask 3 times for water; that's the kind of bartender we had. 

The ugly: because were drinking and having beers, we ordered the Cactus cut nachos. As a pretty regular Boston Pizza customer I'm very used to the cactus cuts, they are slightly spicy and delicious. These came with all the fixings of nachos... sounds delicious in theory... well there were more jalapeños on them then there was anything else! No, I didn't order jalapeños with cactus cuts... I ordered cactus cuts! I spent more time picking off jalapeños then I did eating anything! After attempting to eat some, but the jalapeños taking over, I asked for some sour cream to offset the heat...of course I got charged for that! Really?! So as much as I love the cactus cuts, DO NOT recommend the nacho version!"}
{"text":"If I could give 6 or more I would! Pizza is on point, and don't even get me started on the wings! Bomb.com"}
{"text":"I love so much about this place. 
The pub is the best, big screens to watch the game. Dimmed.lighting, comphy booths and plenty of beer. I love the the menus, and the loctation. A quick drunk stumble to the franklin ctrain station. Super easy. 

Went with my husband and our two friends. Service was excellent, although it took us forever to decide on what to order, their menu is huge. But our waitress kept checking back and no ones glass was ever empty. 

Started with their Spinich Dip, pretty good. But wish they didnt serve it so hot and with more bread to dip. At the end we had half a bowl of dip left with no dippers. But it was good. 

I regret what I ordered. Chipolte Cheese penne. Ahhh it was $16 and not really that big (justified the price by sharing!) and they used way too much seasoning(?) and/or chipolte sauce(?), and I didnt read closly enough as there was huge chunks of bacon. And not like small crispy bacon bits but those cube chunks that taste kinda not cooked and they totally gross me out. I was stoked for a mac and cheese kinda deal but it was more of a bbq bacon dish. (next time im getting their veggie burger with red peppers!)


Everyone else at our table loved what they ordered (and I had some of Norms fries and they were delicious!)

Norm and I ordered desert, I got the chocolate explosion. $7 with dark chocolate moose and a coconut chocolate crust with cheese cake bits in the middle. Pretty good, but coconut is not my fav.

But loved our waitress. And the atmosphere. Fun little bar. Maybe a tad over priced, but we had a good time."}

{"text":"So I tried this place again and ordered through yelp. My goodness!!! My order was confirmed at 4:12pm and it's now 6:15pm exactly and still no food. This is the most ridiculous place to order food from. They're completely lost and not organized at all. Too bad they're so disorganized and don't even care. Please save your money, especially tip since they're so incompetent."}
{"text":"i should learn not to come to any Boston pizza, as it leads to disappointment. 
im not sure why servers this it is acceptable to swear in front of customers, even if its a minor swear word...to further explain the insanity, if you're coming to a restaurant for food, generally speaking you want the food to be hot, i cannot grasp why a server would deliver a plate...that they are holding(so they can feel the temperature...if you catch my drift) that's cold! drinks should be cold! at least they got that right...
the food is bland, lackluster, and probably done in a microwave.
a fair bit of parking, and the restaurant is pretty clean, the bathrooms a hit or miss, depends on the volume of customers. 
lots of t.v's and sports, so by all means come for drinks and a game!"}
{"text":"i would like to think that such a big named franchise would have a standard for being the face of the company.

went here with a group of friends. a dozen or so. 
this place drives me up a wall, as the service from the whole business we recieved was the second WORST service ive ever gotten in my life. 
the restaurant was over heated, as i was sweating the whole time i was in this establishment, we had a very quiet server, who forgot some of our drinks(mine). 
the kitchen didn't deliver all of the food on time either, as my best friends dinner was a good 15 minutes after majority of us got food, and one other friend didn't get a salad after 30 minutes later, which ended up being cancelled. 
refills for drinks were very sparse, no apologies were given on any level.
when it was time for the dessert menus to come out, only one menu was given to an entire table of 12...? WHY?!
the bathroom is an amazing display of not giving a care in the world...the toliet seat had some orangish redish dried something on it, the lock was busted on the partition, the back-up lock for the partition, when you slide the bolt in place, it was short of the latch, and the spacing between the door. finally to make matters worse, every point the partition was anchored, was barely grasped onto the wall...

its really ridiculous when this is a representation of the company that is known for being better then most. 

very dissatisfied and will never go to a boston pizza ever again 

if i could give a zero or a negative number...it would get my lowest vote possible."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from a Boston Pizza - decent pub fare and BIG beers :) Unlike many peoples' experiences, our waiter was very attentive and super friendly particularly considering we were in a large group with separate bills."}
{"text":"Downtown? Tipsy? Need some pizza in your belly?! Boston Pizza is always there for you no matter how late you have stayed up! Great pizza, albeit a bit greasy. But sometimes greasy is exactly what you need after a long night out. ;P"}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends for dinner and I enjoyed my time. They didn't really seat us specifically but told us we could sit wherever we wanted. Our waitress came after maybe 5 minutes to get our drink order and was nice.

My friends got the Chicken Parmesan and I got hot chicken wings. Their food looked amazing and they said they liked it. My wings were so hot they almost burned my mouth.

I will definitely come back here if I am in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here before the Jays game. We were able to get seated right away and wow this place is huge! We were led to the upstairs area by the bar. I felt bad for the bartenders were also our waiter/waitress.

We ordered cactus cut fries but asked for double cheese on top and cooked soft aka not crispy. The waitress didn't seem to understand this as we got very crispy cactus cut chips with the normal amount of cheese. It still tasted okay. My friend and I both ordered a half rack of ribs. I got mine with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, a caesar salad and mixed veggies. The ribs were cooked very well and were so tender and juicy. I'll get a different sauce next time, I wasn't a fan of the flavour I got.

Overall the food and service was good, despite the bartenders making all of the drinks and having an entire section to themselves. Great job!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on a whim and it happened to be 6:30pm on a Saturday night so I didn't think we were going to get a table. We waited about 5 minutes and then were called for a table. The waitress was okay, she barely came by to see us though. My friend got a burger with fries and I got the chicken parmesan with mixed vegetables and spaghetti with meat sauce. Our food came out pretty quickly, within 15 minutes. My chicken parmesan was tasty but wasn't piping hot. Overall the experience was decent and I would come here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends and they said it would be a 20 minute wait, which was understandable because it was a Friday and we didn't make a reservation, LOL. I went to the washroom but before I even finished, my friend got seated at our booth. Our waiter was friendly and did a good job throughout the night.

We were starving by the the 3 of us sat down together. We got The Starting Lineup that came with Cactus Cut Potatoes, Three-Cheese Toast, Bandera Pizza Bread and chose Salt and Pepper Dry Ribs and Hot Wings. I swear this didn't take them longer than 15 minutes to make and it was all hot, fresh, and delicious.

For my main I got the Pesto Chicken Bowtie. There was a hefty portion and it was so good. Pasta was creamy with the right amount of pesto and chicken was cooked well.

I will definitely come back here again if I'm in the area in the future!"}
{"text":"We had a great time, taking a picky 3 year old out is... Interesting. The activity books kept him colouring up a storm, the kids menu is perfect with pictures for him to make his own selections and our server most of all was so great with my son and made sure we were taken care of at all times. Thanks for the great visit Penny, well will be back soon!"}
{"text":"staff - friendly and for the most part, superb.
service - a bit slow
food - 3 times i've been here, all 3 times my food was cold or barely room-temperature."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of someone I know, and must say wasn't let down. Not quite sure if I would rate it as the best but she certainly seemed to think so. It was very good, don't get me wrong.

Ordered a sausage and double pepperoni pizza, though not quite sure if they actually put double on there. It had enough sausage and good amount of pepperoni, just doesn't seem like double, though I have no experience at this place.

The flavor was good, crust had a different taste to it, not bad or great, just different than what I'm used to. The cheese was delicious and pizza came out hot. Sauce was a little skimpy but had some taste.

Will recommend this place to others. Good food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place to a dog. I can't believe the CEO is a Dragon. He has no business giving advice on anything based on the way this place is run.   The food is disgusting and the service was a joke. No idea what prompted me to come here with so many great places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Commençons par la bouf. Beaucoup de choix de pizza à un prix ok. Est-ce qu'elle est bonne? Oui, mais très salé. Si vous voulez pas une des pizza sur le menu et préférer la faire vous même, vous pouvez. Mais attention, le prix va avec et souvent, pour moins d'ingrédient qu'une déjà inscrite sur le menu, cela vous reviendra plus cher.

Concernant les pâtes, les dimensions sont petite. Si vous avez une petite appétit cela sera suffisant mais sinon vous ne serez vraiment pas rassasier.

Pour le service. Je suis allé environ 5 fois en 3 ans à ce Boston pizza et je crois avoir le même constat à chaque fois, service déficient. Quand je suis arrivé sur place, l'accueil était près à me recevoir. On nous assoie proche des cuisines. Dans tout le resto, environ 3 autres tables avec des clients. Notre future serveur a passé devant notre table 3 fois en 10 minutes. Éventuellement elle nous donne nos verre d'eau et repart, sans dire un mot. 15-20 minutes plus tard, elle vient nous revoir et dit \"que prenez vous\". Pas aucune formule de politesse, salut ou autre. Pourtant elle ne donne pas l'impression d'une personne mal élevé ou impolis.

Elle prend notre commande et part. 10-15 minutes plus tard, on nous amène nos assiettes sans rien dire. Nous l'avons reçu 20 minutes après avoir terminer de manger. Le reste du temps elle nettoie des tables vides, parlais avec les autres staff dans le coin, etc. Bref, j'ai trouvé qu'elle manquait de professionnalisme et de présence.

Pour ma part, Boston pizza n'a jamais été un restaurant de prestige, c'est comme un wannabe cage aux sports qui se spécialise dans les pizza.

Tout cela m'a alors rappelé pourquoi je ne vais presque jamais au Boston Pizza même s'il est proche de chez moi. Sans compter que pour le prix, il y a plein d'autre bonne chose chez la compétition"}
{"text":"Ugh. They had no idea what a Yelp check in was and took forever to verify and get me the check In offer. Don't they know I'm elite?? Haha! 

Food was mediocre at best. Service was worse than the food. 

The restaurant was a study in angry and unhappy people. We looked from table to table and saw nothing but frustration and frowns. One family even fought - which I can only assume was about who had the worst meal. I mean when it's that bad, you want to come away with something, so yeah - fight for the right to claim your meal as the worst of the bunch.

I am kind and I look for the good in all, I am entirely too flawed myself to expect perfection from others. So this is hard for me to write but it also means you know it's true.

This place is awful. 

Now I shall go comfort myself with food from somewhere I know I can trust."}
{"text":"I love this Boston Pizza.  
The food is fantastic... 
if there is an issue, the manager does a fantastic job of taking care of his customers.  He has gone out of his way numerous times for me now.
I come here with my friends... I come here with my family... Heck I even come here by myself.  
Great food, great service.  Period."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad and the Pesto Chicken Pasta. The salad came underdressed, so I had to ask for more dressing. Having waited 10 minutes and tried to get the evasive server's attention, she finally but begrudgingly brought me my dressing. 

Having dressed the salad, it was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but decent for the fact that it's a premium fast food. My gf enjoyed the pasta, but it wasn't the best. She also found a couple uncooked pieces. I found the sauce to be extremely bland.

About a year ago I had the gluten free pasta here and it tasted like cardboard cooked in sauté de cardboard. Extremely bland and a terrible gluten free pasta. 

Overall, not too good. Lots could be better, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pizza. And when I get that pizza craving Boston Pizza is usually the most convienent thing next to take out. Plus football was on and it was a Sunday afternoon so I put two together and headed on over!

As we approached the hostess we were given the option of seating in the dining room or bar. We obviously picked the bar so we could watch the game. The hostess told us to take our pick of seat and she'd be over with the menus. Our party of three decided to crash in there oversized comfy cushiony booth.

To start we went with the sliders.

BP Sliders - Three mini burgers topped with cheddar cheese, signature burger sauce banana peppers + bacon $1 
Three sliders in a serving and 3 mouths at are table it seemed like a given. The burgers were juicy, spicy, and perfect with the addition of bacon.

For mains we all got a different pizza

The Great White North - Pizza sauce base, pizza mozzarella, cheddar and smoked ham. Love the smokiness of the ham + ample cheese and that crisp pan crust whats not to love!

Tuscan - Pomodoro sauce base, pizza mozzarella, cheddar, spicy chicken breast, roasted garlic, fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and feta
Great combo of flavours and the chicken does drive a good amount of heat!

The Meator - Bolgnese sauce base topped with smoked ham, pepperoni, seasoned ground beef, spicy Italian sausage and mounds of pizza mozzarella
If your a meat lover get this!

We also ordered a side a pizza sauce for dipping, I love there sauce and it has a little bit of kick to it plus it comes out hot!

Dessert

Chocolate Brownie Addicition - A warm chocolate brownie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce
Your average warm dense chewy fudgey brownie compliamented with cold creamy simple ice cream nothing extravaggant but still delicious and it was pretty big, good for sharing!

Apple Crisp -Slices of sweet granny smith apples in a butter sauce, baked to a crisp with a delicious brown sugar and oat crust. Topped with caramel sauce and served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream
The apples were not sweet pretty tart actually if not for the addition of ice cream and caramel it would have been too sour but the oat topping was good but again nothing extraggant.

Overall service was good, great for relaxing in those cozy booths and watching the game, pizza always delicious, desserts are simple but we came for the pizza and they definitely delivered!"}
{"text":"This location recently went through a complete renovation and finally re opened today! So I came in to check out what they have done with the place and get some grub while I was at it! The reno included a new audio/visual system featuring two 120\" TVs and an updated, modern look inside and out. Basically they gave the place a well deserved face lift and it does look much hipper now.

Our party of five was seated on the lounge/ bar side at a high table towards the back where had great views of all the Tv's and large projection screen tv's. The music was really blasting but it was enjoyable, I suppose they were showing off there new system.

Our waitress was super friendly and really attentive the whole night through! We started off with drinks and in no time she returned with our round of beers and waters. We then ordered an appetizer and she gave us plenty of time to peruse the menus.

Appetizers

Southwest Potato Skins - Potato skins topped with BBQ sauce, chipotle chicken, smoky bacon, melted cheddar and pizza mozzarella, then drizzled with our signature creamy garlic dressing
Good portion size, came with 8 skins were really delicious! Loved smoky bacon, real chunks of chicken and the contrast with the creamy garlic sauce drizzled over top really made the dish!

Cactus Cut Potatoes - Spicy and thinly sliced fried potatoes served w/ cactus dip - a rich blend of crushed chilies, green onion, sour cream and Parmesan
Again another large portion of crispy golden freshly made chips, they looked innocent but definitely packed a good little kick to the them! Luckily the creamy dip helped to cool things down. We devoured this platter in no time!

Finally for mains we all went the wing route. As per our waitress suggestion we went with the Fried Wings (3 different styles to choose from: Breaded, Baked, or Fried and they offer a good selection of flavours too).

Double Order of Salt and Pepper Fried Wings - The classic. Fried until golden and crispy dusted with cracked black pepper and sea salt.
The wings were super crispy cooked well with a nice dusting of spices however the wings themselves were quite small. A double order could of easily filled a single person.

We all still had room for desserts so we all in agreement when our waitress flipped open the menu to reveal what sweets they offered.

Sticky Toffee Pudding - A warm and sweet treat featuring traditional toffee pudding served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and smothered with rich caramel sauce
I am not a fan of toffee nor caramel so I did not enjoy this one, I found it too sweet but the texture of the cake was really nice, warm and moist However mostly everyone else at the table seemed to like this dessert better.

Chocolate Explosion - Ultimate decadence. Creamy chocolate mousse with chunks of cheesecake, caramel, toffee, pecans and almonds on a chocolate crust
As a chocoholic this dessert better suited me. I really enjoyed the chocolate mousse in this cake with the little chunks of cheesecake and the drizzles of chocolate fudge only added to my enjoyment.

Overall service here was really good! Especially since it was there re-opening day and it was chaotic inside our waitress was amazing! Bringing refills of water before we even had to alert her and clearing plates like a pro she was kind and funny too. Overall I'd stick to there amazing apps and pizza but steer clear of there wings."}

En plat principal s'était une pizza individuelle au pepperoni un demi sandwich au buf au jus et un steak frite tous était délicieux 

Pour dessert un mousse chocolat et un Rocky Mountain au chocolat 
  

Notre serveuse était extraordinaire service impeccable 10/10"}
{"text":"Need to update their hours if they don't deliver after dark to certain area"}
{"text":"We haven't had a bad meal here yet.  Food is decent for the price and service is pretty fast.  It isn't the cleanest restaurant I've seen, but it isn't filthy either.  Two of the four times we've been there the Manager has stopped by our table to see how our meal was, this was a nice touch to the service."}
