{"text":"To be perfectly blunt, the fish was NOT fresh.  I didn't get sick, but the meal was simply not enjoyable."}
{"text":"My sister and I are fans, and come here enough to be recognized by some of the waiters there. Decor is not Japanese or anything remotely far eastern, but it's comfortable, and honestly, I don't care when eating. 

Between two people (not including any alcoholic drinks), the bill comes to somewhere $30-$40. For the quality of food and service, I think it's reasonable."}
{"text":"I never heard of this place until I saw a voucher on Dealfind and since I love Sushi I thought why not. 

I live on the east end of Mississauga and it being in Oakville was enough of a trek but so well worth it! They call this place Crazy Sushi for a reason, because the Sushi is CRAZY GOOD! I have been to many Sushi places before (mostly all you can eat) and this one is by far the best. It is an order off the menu style but because of this, they pay much attention to detail, presentation and flavour combinations. 

The staff was very friendly and patient as well. As we walked in, there was a table where I am assuming the manager, chef and others of high authority were sitting and as we were being seated, they all made an effort to say hello which was quite impressive. 

Even though this place is further then close for me, I make an effort to visit because it is just that good. Keep it up Crazy Sushi!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place even to my worst enemy. 

I came here with a friend to use up a Dealfind voucher I had purchased. First thing I noticed was that there were only about 3 tables occupied in the whole restaurant including ours. It was 6:30 which at most restaurants is when they start to have the dinner rush. We were there for almost 2 hours and the \"rush\" never came. Warning sign?... I think so. 

The food was mediocre at best as I didn't find the quality to be great. Some of the rolls were weird and the flavor combinations not at all complimentary. For example, the lobster roll (actually imitation lobster) had a curry like flavor to it and we couldn't figure out what it was wrapped in. Took one bite and nearly spit it out. Almost all the rolls we tried had a ton of shredded imitation crab meat as a cheap and plentiful filler. Our server never bothered to check to see how we were doing or offer drink refills. If we needed anything we had to flag her down. 

At the end of our unsavory meal we presented the voucher only to be told we couldn't use it because we didn't have a reservation. WTF? There was no one in the restaurant, why would you need a reservation?!? After arguing with the server and the manager for 20 minutes, we got so fed up that we just paid the full bill and left. 

This place is in desperate need of a restaurant makeover in all aspects or they should just do everyone a favor and shut their doors permanently."}
{"text":"Love this place.

My house is probably about a 5 minute drive from here, so whenever I'm home, my family usually makes a visit here at least once. My parents have known the owners for quite a few years now, so it's an added bonus that we get extra friendly service.

They offer a mix of Korean and Japanese food, which works well with my family--the parentals prefer to stick with Korean food. The rolls are quite good and they have a decent variety. The Korean food is yummy too. I've tried haemul soondooboo jjigae (seafood tofu stew) and yukgaejang (spicy beef soup) there, and they are both AWESOME. Sometimes sushi joints that offer Korean food kinda slack on the Korean, but they seem to do great in both arenas.

So if you want some Korean/Japanese in Oakville/West Mississauga, definitely check it out! Perfect for dinner and then a movie at the AMC theatres which is like a 1 minute walking distance away."}
{"text":"Groupon brought me here, although I didn't use a groupon.  

First off, I ordered too much food.  When you order you don't think that it's enough food, but when they bring it to you its much more than you think it will be.

Good quality food, and good quantity.  The service is slow, but maybe because right now they are not used to be influx of business that Groupon brought.

I recommend this place if you're looking for something in the are.  The interior is not as nice as some other places.  It used to be a 60's diner and they still haven't update the decor."}
{"text":"This place is well located in the Oakville Centrum and is close to the AMC movie theatre, so it is a great place for dinner and a movie.  

I have previously enjoyed the free appetizers that you get at this place and the portions of the sushi rolls have always been great, to the point that only one set of rolls is usually enough for two people.  

I enjoy the quality of the sashimi and the creativity of the rolls (although they are hard to put in your mouth!). 

I suggest that if you go here, try the items in the menu one by one, so you get to enjoy them thoroughly, and order as you need.  The food usually comes quickly and you will enjoy it much more when it is at the right temperature!"}
