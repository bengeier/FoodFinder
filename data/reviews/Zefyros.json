{"text":"Wow. Wow.  Love the food.  Love the background Greek music.   It really shows a family run business      The pita was one of the best.  Better than marathon and close to what I had in Greece.   Clean, friendly and again amazing food.    The price is fantastic and the amount of food was good.   A gem.   Folks give this a must try you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great new greek restaurant! Felt like home cooking. Small and cozy and very clean. Delicious daily specials. Had the stuffed tomatoes and greek salad. My husband had the octopus pasta and the phyllo wrapped feta with delicious honey and balsamic. Dessert was great too :) Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Zefyros is a family-run restaurant which specializes in Greek cuisine. After seeing some of their Yelp pictures I really wanted to experience what they had to offer. One picture in particular had fries inside the souvlaki pitas so I knew this place offered the authentic experience I had when I visited Greece in the past.  After enjoying a meal here, I can validate in this review that this place indeed offers an excellent souvlaki pita. The pita in itself is prepared the old school traditional Greek way... fried.... then filled with the most moist tasty meat of your choice, drenched in their homemade tzatziki, add savory tomatoes & onions then they stuff the pita with some French fries.... SOOO GOOOD!!!!  About that tzatziki! They serve it really strong here and at first and even though I really enjoy tzatziki I was initially taken aback... then I ate it more... then more... I WANTED MORE.  MOAAR.  Great pita, tzatziki and souvlaki. Fries are on point, Greek salad was just OK.  Plate portion was very generous! Which is awesome for some but for others a little too wasteful. I really don't need half a place of fries but hey, there's value there for some of you gluttons.  We also had loukaniko but it was only OK. I was hoping to have it oiled up, sliced and prepped that way but we just received one long sausage. Meh.  Service was very good, quite friendly.  Price-tag was OK but I'd prefer to pay a little less, perhaps the plate can be a little smaller?"}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars I would. From the outside you cannot imagine how good the food is. The presentation is beautiful. The taste is incredible. The service is impeccable.   In order to compare it in a rightful manner to our other usual Greek outings, we ordered our typical meal. One large Greek salad, one pork souvlaki pita and one chicken souvlaki pita. We were very impressed as soon as the Greek salad arrived. As you can see from the picture attached, the salad looks delicious. You can taste the effort that they put even in the simple meal.   We had another nice surprise when we received our pitas. They were assembled in an unusual manner for Montreal: they came with fries in the pita and with just enough tzatziki in order not to cover the taste of the fresh and perfectly cooked meat.  We can't wait to bring our friends and family. They will love it."}
{"text":"Holy moly!  This place is amazing!  We were visiting Canada for work and found this restaurant through the great Yelp reviews. All of those reviewers were right. The pitas were soft, the meat was perfectly grilled, and the cucumber sauce was the best I'd ever had. Great dinner!"}
{"text":"First time trying this greek resto. First I must say is the service and price were excellent. It alone gave the 5 stars. the food was 4 star but the service was just great......girl had a smile the whole time and went out of her way for anything. Pastichio was good but not like moms and neither was the stuffed tomatoes. Mousaka was excellent. All veggies excellent which came with the meals. Souvlaki on a stick and pita was amazing...just like greece. Fries were heaven and cut in house. Greek mountain tea great with greek honey. Chicken wings were great and best surprise was the greek Halva. Last time I had that was when my mom made it when I was a kid. Great experience and I will be back."}
