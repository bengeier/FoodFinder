{"text":"Very thoughtful owner,  nice clean little place.  Had the lunch special,  shawerma and soup.    Pickle soup? Yep pickle soup,  and it was wonderful,  little pieces of chopped pickles and fresh dill,  potatoes and carrots,  very nice and satisfying.   Shawerma was ok,  not great,  but it's a Persian style sandwich and tasty.  I am accustomed to knock down wraps but this lunch was enjoyable and the owner is a gem"}
{"text":"Waste of money and calories ,  nothing fresh , all reheated , even falafel was from microwave , when I asked the owner/chef, he was very defensive and said \" falafel can never be made fresh to order , just not practical\" my response \" to be practical , cancel my order and give me my money back\"."}
{"text":"This location was convenient. Wanted something healthy & tasty. For a decent price.  The gave me a small plain 3 item salad with a little chicken on it.   It was like I said. Small.  Plain & apx $14.00.   Kinda Crazy!  People weren't too pleasant either. Not very generous with the portions"}
{"text":"i ordered via justeat.ca. ordered a lamb souvlaki with 2 sides 16.99. one would think for 16.99 you would get a decent portion of meat or at least of the sides.  i ordered tabouleh as a side and the persian salad as the other.  the tabouleh was a joke, barely any parsely, all just onion. looked no different from the \"persian salad\". portion was as if it were one side.  and only got one skwerer of the lamb, tastelss and plain too.    the order was made around 5 pm , i got a call close to 6 asking where the delivery was to be made after specifying in details on the online form.   and the food wasnt delivered till around 645."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of different shawarma places in oakville and this is near the lower end of the list. don't get me wrong, it's not bad at all but, in my opinion, far too pricey for the small portions when there are other options in town where you can get a plate of shawarma and rice that could easily make two meals for under $10"}
{"text":"Wow I really don't understand the bad reviews about this place.  The chicken shawarma is amazing!  He cooks everything to order and it's all made from scratch.   I have lots of food allergies with preservatives and had no issues here."}
{"text":"One of the places that we regret trying.. waste of money and terrible customer service. Quality of food is below average,  The shawerma is tasteless,  and we got heartburn, and when we complained they were about to throw us out in a discriminating way and they raised there voices to us... they should be out of this kind of business."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma was very good. Onions were fried with the meat. Good sauces and very tasty. The older man at the cash wasn't very smiley and seemed offended when I asked why the price on my bill was different from the menu. \"It's written on the menu: Prices subject to change! It's because of Kathleen Wynn!\" So it's $9 per chicken shawarma. And I feel like crap for asking a question."}
{"text":"We work in Oakville area and are always looking for different restaurants in the area that offer great food at good prices.  Zagros owner Mo made us feel welcome as he explained his menu and gave us suggestions. We have never been disappointed with the quality of the food and  it has become a favourite for our whole office staff.  Try the chicken shawarma pasta for something different and delicious. I have driven to Oakville from Grimsby on more than one Saturday to treat my family."}
