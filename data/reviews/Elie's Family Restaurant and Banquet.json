{"text":"I eat breakfast here twice a month with a networking group. I've tried a number of dishes and everything has been wonderful. I recommend the spinach/feta omelet.  Coffee is always fresh and good. Service is great."}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and were curious... Sadly, we'll never go back. The chicken fried steak tasted like mystery meat, everything was doused in extra salt, and the vegetables tasted like they'd been in a freezer for years and then poorly reconstituted. Our meals were a disaster.

The only two saving graces: A surprisingly decent salad bar (with a lot of fresh fruit and fresh spinach and other fresh, healthy things) and a relatively chipper waitstaff."}
{"text":"Three words. Corned beef hash. The menu says homemade and they definitely hit the mark. I'm always impressed when I can have poached eggs on the side and these were cooked to medium, just the way I asked.

A hot spot in Monona on this Saturday morning. I'll be back, especially because parking is free and easy, a vast difference from downtown Madison."}
{"text":"It filled a void...I had a salad and soup and somehow left bloated..service was slow....maybe better for breakfast..I will never know."}
{"text":"I first found this place by mistake.  I tried to go another place and I could not find.  My wife and I ended up Elie's after all.

However, we were so surprised by how nice and friendly they are and how good the food is.  All my family love this place and we go to this place at least once a month.  

If there were 6 star option, I would be glad to give 6 stars."}
{"text":"I've been in for a couple breakfasts now and they are really good at what they do - a nice greasy spoon meal! It makes me feel like being back home....I've never had a wait (even on the weekend), everything is cooked in butter, the waitresses are nice and treat you like family. I've done the biscuits and gravy, and the eggs benedict - YUM, just yum. You know, this is the kind of food I cannot do often, it's so heavy and rich, but when I'm in the mood this is a great place to go! My husband had the corned beef hash and loved it....it's very family friendly and I feel comfortable toting my toddler into this place, both times the people working were all super friendly with her and they brought her out some toys to play with!  Oh yeah, they do FREE COOKIES, like warm yummy chocolate chip cookies, with an order. They are so good! If you're looking for somewhere to eat on the weekend in Madison, and you don't want a long wait - seriously check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went this am...NEVER AGAIN! Cheese and ham omelet w hashbrowns and grilled onions light on onion and sourdough toast. Well hashbrowns not cooked barely browned and a ton of raw onions!! And white toast. They would not even adjust bill....the omelet was luke warm butter wouldnt even melt!!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I only had a shake at Elie's, but, let me tell you about that shake. My daughter and I tried the chocolate peanut butter shake. It was fabulous. After a day at Fired Up Pottery, we had painted up an appetite. Being new to town we had been on the look out for places to replace our favorite go to ice cream places in Milwaukee. The owner of Fired Up Pottery recommended Elie's shakes. They were great. Thick, smooth, and flavorful. I can't speak to Elie's food, but we will be back for more shakes!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite breakfast place in the area. The portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable. The staff is always very friendly and helpful, and it's always very clean."}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch. The service is descent. The potato soup was a little bland. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch pita that was a lunch special. I'm glad I got it. Tasted very good and it was filling. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I ventured down Cottage Grove on an Easter morning walk to find that my destination (Cottage Cafe) was closed due to Easter, so on I ventured until I came across Elie's.

Breakfast was my goal, and Elie's looked inviting.  The inside is pretty basic...very open.  I was quickly seated and had coffee within 4 minutes of being seated.  I went simple with 2 eggs over medium, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 sausage links and 2 pancakes.  Eggs were prefect, bacon was good, sausage okay (I am not a big sausage fan) and the pancakes were okay.  The food was delivered quick and hot.  Coffee refills were frequent and plentiful.  The woman serving was pleasant and attentive.

So for breakfast....four stars for the combination of service and food, with service being 5 star and the food more towards the 3.5 star area.

The best comment....I will be back!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the have the best American fries in town. Service is always fast. Very competent waitstaff."}
{"text":"We loved the breakfast we had here. Wife enjoyed the French toast and my eggs and ham and American fries were excellent. Service was 5 star as well."}
{"text":"This place is a great improvement over the former restaurant. It appears to have been completely redone and cleaned up. The result is a clean, well lighted place. Inexpensive meals in the traditional family style but without the grease. I tried the breakfast burrito which was nicely done with the wrap lightly grilled. Coffee is much better than you would expect in a restaurant like this, and staff is prompt, friendly and helpful. We'll be back to try a dinner. Next door to Ben Franklin, Monona Bootery, Bongo Video, Happy Bambino in the Lakeside Shopping Center."}
{"text":"Or first ever visit to Elie's for lunch today.  A very clean, friendly neighborhood place to eat.  Hubby had the chili burger with fries. He added bacon to the burger and the server didnt even bat an eyelash. He said it was a little light on the Chili but the flavor was good.  Burgers are big 1/2lb. I had the jalape√±o burger which was not spicy but still good. The fries are fantastic! They need to brew fresh ice tea instead of the fountain version as it was very yucky and i opted for ice water rather than drink the fountain ice tea. 
Bathrooms are very clean.
Servers are super friendly and the food is cooked when you order rather than warmed under a light.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very clean family diner with all day breakfast and senior discounts. Very good Monte Cristo sandwich, crispy fries and good sized portions. Kept the coffee filled too."}
{"text":"I really wish I could like this place because the people were really nice but the food was AWFUL.  Literally lost my lunch, if you know what I mean.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"I've got to give this place 5 stars purely because they are so fantastic working with GiGi's Playhouse.  This is very much a family style diner, kitchen to the back and loads of tables and booths.  You could easily fit a large party in here and have room to talk.  It's also a very quiet atmosphere, and with LED lights above each booth you can actually see the menu and your companions.

The menu is simple home-cooking American foods: meatloaf, sandwiches, chicken, and homemade pies.  The dinnerware reminds me of my grandmother and just makes me feel warm and fuzzy.  We had already been out for lunch, so we did desert and clearly the cute silver platter serving bowl was a hit with this girl.  The pie crust was flaky and buttery and the service was friendly and fast.  

Sometimes the simplicity of comfort is just good."}
