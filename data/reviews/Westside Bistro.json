{"text":"I've ate here 2 different times and both were uneventful. The first time, I decided to go with the buffet. The chicken soup was good (I had 2 bowls) but the roasted chicken was so dry it actually got stuck in my throat! They had a stir fry, where you choose your own veggies and they stir fry them. When I got back to my table, I tried to stick my fork in a carrot and the carrot flew of the table because it was so hard. The stir fry was RAW and gross. My next visit I decided to eat off the menu. I ordered the 9.00 cheeseburger. The waiter asked me how I wanted it cooked; I said medium. When I got the burger, it was really small and way overdone! I think this academy is simply pushing students through without real training so they can simply get out in the workforce. I'm giving them 2 stars because the waitstaff was courteous. NOT FOR THE FOOD..."}
{"text":"Definitely let down, my coworkers would rave about this place so I thought I'd try it out for lunch today and was underwhelmed. Not awful but not great by any means. The workers were friendly but the food was subpar."}
{"text":"At at the mini buffet.  Food ranged from edible to quite good.  The food itself probably deserves 3 to 4 stars out of context, but in this training environment and for the price, I'm going 5 stars."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the lunch buffet since I was on this side of town. Yes, these are culinary students, and yes they do have an instructor supervising them. The buffet options are limited, but everything is done in small batches so it is fresh and hot. Since there are quite a few students in the kitchen and the dining area, service is very quick and drinks are refilled fast. Even though it is a buffet, the introductory appetizer for each table are some very well done thinly sliced potato chips that are not greasy, but super crispy served with a dipping sauce. At the buffet, you are also served by students."}
{"text":"This \"teaching\" restaurant is part of the Culinary Academy. What I've learned from going there is that it's a great place for an inexpensive yet filling lunch.

The staff is friendly and attentive ... almost TOO attentive at times! At many restaurants, I have to wait to get refills on my drinks. At the Westside Bistro, I've often had two waiters ask me if I want a refill while a third is off getting it done.

Although you can order off the menu, why bother? For the same price (under $10), you can go through the buffet, which is small compared to the casino buffets but provides plenty of tasty offerings.

The staff behind the buffet line serves you, but you can go back as many times as you like. There's always a soup or two, a fresh salad, and a few pizzas, but this time (like most) I skipped these and stuck with the entrees and side dishes. 

Didn't care for the cold corn salad, but everything else was superb. Coq au vin and  lamb shanks were both cooked perfectly, which even the top buffets usually can't pull off. Sides included kalamata mashed potatoes and rice pilaf, which were also executed perfectly. There were a few desserts to choose from, but after two helpings of meats and sides, I was stuffed. I did sample the flan, which was spicy and serviceable, and I had a bite of the brownie, which was pretty much ... a brownie.

Because of the buffet-style dining, I was back to work in less than an hour, so this place is a great option for anyone working in the Spaghetti Bowl area (or even a bit further out). Take a lesson from me, and try the Westside Bistro for lunch. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service, food is excellent.  We came because of Yelp, glad we did.  We would come back, but we are tourists.
  The buffet looked good, but we had sandwiches.  Comes with a free appetizer."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about the WB over the past couple months and jumped at the chance to be able to see culinary students giving their all.

Upon arrival I began to watch everyone to see what they were doing.  Like any other students  some work harder than others but everyone I think overall did their best to represent their school.  There were smiles everywhere.

The food on the buffet line ($8.50) was pretty damn good.  It's not like a typical Vegas buffet; the portions are smaller, the presentation simple but the quality and care in preperation was outstanding.

The asparagus, chicken marsala, apricot pork medallions and the talapia...Oh, the talapia in the magic sauce...awesome.  Three trips awesome.

Be sure to check in. There is a yelp coupon for a free drink or $1 off the buffet."}
{"text":"I came here for an early lunch. They open at 11 am. It's a culinary restaurant where a head chef trains other chefs to cook and serve excellent food. It's $9.00 for buffet and I believe kids under 7 eat for free. We had a buy one get one free coupon at this awesome place, so that saved us money. The waiters and waitresses were nice and were good about refilling our drinks. I honestly felt like royalty eating here. It's fancy and the food here was excellent. 

Everyday is a different menu. I got to try the gumbo, rice, catfish, mashed potatoes, chicken and jalape√±o corn bread. I enjoyed everything except the catfish. Cat fish was really dry because it sat under a heated lamp. Gumbo was good with the rice. Mashed potatoes were soft and fresh. The corn bread was moist and perfect. I was getting full because everything was so filling. I washed my food with a Diet Coke. For dessert I had a strawberry mousse that tasted like a peanut butter mousse as well. It was topped with a crunchy sweet crouton. It was delicious! My daughter had a pumpkin pie and a chocolate brownie. I didn't get to try it but my daughter enjoyed it. 

Plenty of parking up front and it's next to a recreation center. Restrooms were outside of the dining area and surprisingly the restrooms were clean. 

The inside was small but it was very fancy with the food. I definitely would come back if I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"The buffet is $9 and it came with a beverage.   For the price and service I can forgive a lot.  The service was good.  No tip is  necessary.  

I can't say it was the most memorable food I have ever had but I've had worse food and the presentation was good.  All the entrees are $9 so it makes choosing easy.  

The staff is very friendly and upbeat too.

Recommend you check it out.  Good food for decent price."}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING lunch at Westside Bistro today and the Service was EXCELLENT. Keep up the good work. I will be BACK!"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food. You can pick buffet style or one of the weekly items. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Thank you Westside Bistro"}
{"text":"Although they have a menu, the buffet is the way to go. It's small, but there's enough to keep you satisfied. For about $8.50(or $7.50 if you check in on Yelp), you'll find 4-5 meat items, pizza slices, potatoes or rice, a salad item, and 2 types of soup. And the price  includes a beverage. You are served by the staff behind the buffet line and the servings are small, but you can always go back for more. As this is a training restaurant for the Culinary School, you'll be priviliged to sample new and unique recipes.And you are encouraged to critique your food. My \"likes\" usually outnumber my \"don't likes\". But since the buffet menu changes daily, you can come back another day and discover your perfect meal. For me, that would include their chocolate chip cookies which are to die for! And don't forget to try their complimentary homemade potato chips and dip! Yum! The servers are very attentive and more than happy to get you whatever you need(more beverage, more butter). If you get soup at the beginning of the line, they'll take that back to your table while you fill up your plate. I really recommend this place. If I lived closer, I'd come here everyday!"}
{"text":"This place takes customer service to a new level. It's like customer service on steroids. Absolutely incredible. Of course, they are all in training and trying to impress, but it's always nice to be treated like royalty. I have been multiple times and have always gotten the lunch buffet, but this time ordered from the menu. I opted for the Fish and Fries Basket. Outstanding. Hot and fresh fries and hot, crispy fish. Good portion sizes too. The Mrs. got the Chopped Chicken Salad. I stole a few bites and it was tasty. It was definitely big enough for two to split. They start every table off with homemade potato chips and dipping sauce. Both are very good. Lunch for two, with beverages was just under $20. A definite must visit. You won't be disappointed. Keep in mind the menu and buffet changes, as this is a training restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to be a student at The Westside Bistro so I'll be able to give an in depth review on this restaurant. I promise I won't be biased either haha. 

Westside Bistro is located inside The Culinary Academy of Las Vegas. Most of the employees and and chiefs are actually students in training and are being graded in a real restaurant atmosphere . Their service and skills must be on point in order to graduate. 

The restaurant or shall I say bistro is not that big it's actually quite small and only open from 11am to 2pm, so the window of actually getting here on time is quite small. The ambiance is quite nice and has an upscale vibe to it . There are no booths here just table seating and they also have a patio area to eat at that bistro which opens only when the weather is nice. 

The service is outstanding!, students are well trained by the instructor and manager of The West Side Bistro Mrs. Starr Davis. They are not allowed to hit you with the \"what you want to drink\" or \"what can I get ya\". They are trained to say \"welcome to the Westside Bistro my name is____ I will be your bus person/server today. May I offer you a coke or a coffee?\" The students are also trained in tray holding, table clearing, and how to anticipate guest needs. At the Westside Bistro they make you feel very important with big friendly smiles :) just remember they're just students so dropping or spilling your drink is a possibility. 

Now for the food!!!! The bistro has an  al la carte menu and also a buffet that changes everyday. Both are made by the students with the supervision of their superior. I had the Cobb salad which was excellent big serving the chicken and ham did not taste cold or defrosted very fresh ingredients. Also the bistro burger was also excellent ,the burger patty is cooked to your liking and those onion rings were off the chain! Haha  You would never expect this place to have such good food and service but trust me you'll be delightfully surprised. Also the price is crazy affordable everything is literally only 9 dollars and that includes your drink also kids 12 and under eat for free. I do recommend GO GO GO !"}
{"text":"This is our number one lunch spot! Westside Bistro is a favorite around our office, especially their delicious California Burger. We usually go for the buffet, because it's always something new and delicious. The service is AMAZING!!! Danny, the Manager, is great and always ensures we're pleased with our food and service. This is great hidden gem, and we will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We had the lunch buffet.  Service is very good because there are more workers than there are customers.  This place is part of a school.  I have to say they are trying their best and are really nice people and it's only $8.99 per person.   The decor is clean and very new looking.  It's also a little confusing because they hand you a menu and don't even mention the buffet unless you ask about it.  The menu itself has only three main dishes:  Cheesburger. Taco Salad.  Shrimp PoBoy.

The food is hit or miss.  It seems like they are trying some sort of newfangled low sugar, low carb, low salt, low flavor menu.  Two soups.  The potato soup was pretty bland.  The chicken and rice was not bad.  The fish was OK.  The pork \"tenderloin\" was not bad and was the best choice.  There was also something called blackened chicken which is not like any blackened food I have ever had because it had no heat at all.  Blackened food should be spicy.  This was not.

On to the deserts.  It's weird, but they all tasted like diet food.  There was hardly any sugar in these deserts.  It is mostly like little finger deserts you would get on a strip buffet, but with none of the decadent sugar you would expect in deserts.

Of overall it was A-OK and worth the money.  I wouldn't take a date here or out of town guests.  If I had to sum it up in one phrase it would be - not quite ready for prime time."}
{"text":"The Westside Bistro is a restaurant that is a part of the Culinary Training Academy, which is an organization funded by a trust between a couple local unions and a couple local resort/casino companies. CTA provides training for individuals who wish to advance in or join the hospitality industry. The training is not only in culinary skills, but also house keeping and maintenance related jobs. 

The Westside Bistro is a part of the training for those students in the culinary program. Students work as food servers, cooks, and buspersons at the restaurant. Because of this, you will find incredible food and even better service for a very reasonable price.

Yesterday, I visited the WB for lunch with a colleague. We had a meeting down the road, and had planned on a nice gourmet lunch. The WB is only open for Breakfast and Lunch during the week, but they do offer catering. Their lunch menu is very simple with a few sandwiches and salads, as well as a buffet. The buffet is the most expensive option at $7.95/person. The buffet is small, only a handful of stations, but it is AYCE. The food is what makes this buffet incredible. They always have veggie options (and both times I've been there has been a vegan option), and meat options alike. They also have a salad bar, and occasionally have a pasta bar. Yesterday I had the minestrone (which was fresh, full of veggies and delicious), the veggie calzone, the mashed potatoes (wow) and assorted salad and veggies. For dessert I had a small cup with peach and apple cobbler and a lemon raspberry concoction.   According to my colleague, the catfish was also incredible. 
With your buffet, you do get unlimited standard drink refills. 

As previously mentioned the staff are incredible. We went when the Bistro opened at 11am, and there was at least 1 waiter per table, if not more. It got busier the closer to noon it got, but they still have a lot of staff for a small operation. The food servers and the chef were very helpful and knowledgeable. They explained to me what was in the food and how it was cooked. It is exciting to know that this training exists as sometimes it can be real hit or miss for service on the Strip. 

If you are ever in the area, you should definitely give the WB a try. It is a great place to have business meetings as the food is great, its inexpensive and the facility is pretty class (and small). 

It is also great to support an organization that provides great opportunities for our fellow community members to advance in their job, or to train for new careers in the hospitality industry."}
{"text":"This restaurant is associated with the culinary academy so you are the guinea pig of future Executive Chefs.  They start you off with complimentary homemade potato chips and creamy dipping sauce.  The menu items change monthly and the buffet items changes daily.  Therefore, I won't describe what I ate because different items will likely be served when you go.  This is nice because you can go back frequently without getting tired of the options.  The buffet is not super big, like the ones at the casinos, but it has approximately 20 items.  Everything I tasted was very good.  Fresh and flavorful.  They may be students, but the food is prepared under supervision of instructors.  The dining area, kitchen, serving area, and all workers were very clean.  Every person that I interacted with was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The cooking and serving staff are in training and being scrutinized by instructors, so expect everyone to put their best foot forward.  The buffet was around $8.  I think Yelp check-ins get another dollar off.  Great experience.  I recommend everyone try this place.  You won't be disappointed.  Excellent deal for the price."}
{"text":"An excellent place for lunch. The food is solid and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the lunch buffet which consisted of a small but quaint selection. Two soups, five sides, a couple of salads, two meats, and a fish.  Oh and a couple of desserts which I forgot to try.  Service is very friendly, though the in-training server to customer ratio is a bit high.  Would love to try more often except it's too far from my part of town."}
{"text":"When this place is open, can't really beat it. The buffet is quite good and very reasonably priced.  I guess it's less expensive because they have students working there, but the food is always enjoyable, usually some delectable desserts are included as well."}
{"text":"I didn't do my research before coming here and just picked it because it was cheapish and near the 15. We were pretty surprised when we arrived and realized the restaurant is run by students. 

The food was pretty good though the menu is very limited. The buffet did not look very good. The service was over attentive because the servers are still in training. 

Overall it's a good place to stop if you're passing through north Vegas, need a quick lunch, and are forgiving for the little mistakes student staff would make."}
{"text":"I found myself on this side of town and had to check Yelp for guidance on where we should eat & I found this little gem.
Its attached to the Culinary school. When  you walk in you are greeted by many students. They are all waiting on you. We ended up getting the buffet...which is more like a mini buffet. If you check in on Yelp you get $1 off..which makes it only $7 and that includes your drink.
It was a great deal. The food is way above par since they are training to work in the finer foodie joints.
Service was above and beyond as was the food.
I will try  to make it back since the menu changes daily."}
{"text":"Always tasty and the service is excellent. It is a small buffet so really picky people will not have as much to choose from but I have always been pleased."}
{"text":"A cooking school - YAY - what a delight to eat at a cooking school!  I loved it. My friend didn't like his carrots dente - but mine were perfect. The twice-baked potato soup was amazing! And things only got better from there - there was so much to try, I missed the fish, and now I wish I had had it. I'll have to go back.  The desserts rocked my world! Also I had both an Arnold Palmer and a coffee, so I expected my bill to be higher because of it; but they were included! Imagine that!! 
I WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet friendly staff,great service. These students are destined for greatness in the culinary industry"}
{"text":"Great food! The menu changes daily.  Usually, excellent service, but my credit card was compromised last Wednesday!!! :-(. If you visit, please use cash!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am so glad yelp helped me find this place. This is a training branch of the attached culinary school. The menu is simple - one of 6 weekly specials or the buffet. The food was great! I ate the buffet and it was very high quality, low variety - not your typical buffet (i.e. it was good food not just edible). The price was unbelievably low given the nice atmosphere, great service, and great food."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem.  The food was very good, the service was excellent.  Considering that you can order off of a limited one sheet menu or utilize the buffet, my overall experience here the two times I've been here has been great.  Both times I've had the buffet.  Most of the food is pretty good, but there are some things that aren't.  When coming here you are greeted with friendly people.

If you're short on time, and need to eat quickly, this may be a place to come if you're in the area."}
{"text":"When I worked on Owens we used to come 2-3 times a month for lunch. What a fabulous place! Buffet always changing. Staff always pleasant. Price is perfectly reasonable! Came this past week for a quick bite - and they did not disappoint!"}
