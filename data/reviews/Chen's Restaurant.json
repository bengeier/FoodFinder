{"text":"I live in Baldwin and it is sometimes very difficult to drive the 20-25 minutes it takes to get here, but it is soooo worth it! There is no Canadian-Chinese restaurant in the Georgina area that is better than this place. Sutton, Keswick, Uxbridge, whatever - this is the best place to get your Chinese food fix.  They do everything really well, I can't think of one thing to recommend because if you go to a Chinese restaurant you know what to order. Their special \"Chen's Chicken\" is good, though. They also have one of the better hot and sour soups out there.  Best Chinese restaurant in the area. And that's coming from someone from Markham, so you're gonna have to trust me on this one."}
{"text":"Pretty good value both in quality and quantity.  House crispy beef is sweet and tasty, chow meins always good.  General Tso is a must.   Only reason i didnt rate a 5 is because theyre always 5-15 mins longer than they tell you to pickup on the phone (only because theyre always super busy) but you end up having to stand and wait in their crappy restaurant where old plates remain on tables...then you begin to contemplate the cleanliness of the kitchen which is hidden.  Cash discount is always appreciated though!  Food is always pretty good for the $$."}
