{"text":"Pad thai, green curries,  ginger tea to die for. I would write a longer review on how amazing this place is but I kind of want to keep it as my little secret right now. Don't let the fact it's in a movie complex deter you; this is authentic viet thai with the most inviting service to cap it off."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Not your everyday pad Thai. Excellent service. Can be relaxed or formal."}
{"text":"Great, great place!  Not sure what's up with the neg review.  We were here at the end of October and out of our group of eight not a single person regretted the decision.  Food was delicious, between all of us we had the Basil Red Snapper - Yum, Chicken Pad Thai - great, Red Snapper with Sweet and Sour Sauce, Children's pad thai, Ginger Chicken, Eggplant dish (vegetarian)... maybe I'm forgetting someone or we doubled up.  And the portions were generous."}
{"text":"Before I begin let me start by saying I am not a Thai food fan. What I mean is that I have found it hard to find authentic Thai restaurants close to home so I've just stayed away until my daughter raved about this place and OH MY she was correct. The restaurant is small, quaint and simple yet inviting. It felt like a little hide-away even though it was busy. The service was warm, friendly, timely and courteous. Now we ordered the red snapper and my goodness, the presentation says it all. It was flaky, tender and the perfect seasoned crunch to contrast the smooth curry, fresh vegetables and delicate shrimp.   I have nothing else to say besides this is a hidden gem and a great date night spot with the movie theatre next door. If you're a foodie,  A must add to your list! 2 thumbs up and 2 of my friends thumbs too!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. It's great local place if you don't want to go far and you live in Mississauga or Brampton. We had their mango salad and Pad Thai, Pad Sew and everything was great!   Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"While traveling for business I stopped in on a Tuesday around 5:30. The staff was attentive and very nice. I ordered the Thai Vegetable Roll (2) and the Thai Spicy Noodles with vegetables. Both were very good. The place filled up quickly after I arrived and several tasty looking dishes were coming out all around me and being well received by those who ordered them. If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best thai food in mississauga. We've been coming for years and usually regret not coming here when we have thai food somewhere else.  Usually get the lamb shank curry and the red curry with shrimp."}
{"text":"First of all the wait time is horrendous.  It wasn't as busy as Pai or the main stream Thai food. The calamari was small portioned and just full battered.  Did I mention the wait time? We waiting for 30 minutes to get fried calamari. And another for the entr√©e. Yet take outs come and go!!!!!... Seriously...  Food was 4/5...  But the wait time Holy shit. And we ordered chicken pad Thai and got BEEF!... If you plan to eat here go take out seriously."}
{"text":"Came here about a year ago -  got the red curry. Very nice and clean place, very tasty. Servers are helpful and attentive. When I came I came for weekend lunch, quality of the food is very good and prices are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my family. They never like to try new places or foods! And they looooved it. Joey our server was great and even sang a Bollywood song that floored my sister in law! great place!"}
{"text":"Thanks Anna & Henry for one of the best Thai experiences that I've ever had. Everything is made either fresh or from scratch and the prices are competitive. But wait until you have tried the Basil Chicken, fresh mouth watering Mango Salad, and coconut rice. The Food Network must hear about this place."}
{"text":"Visiting the area. Hungry for Thai. This place was great. Started off with spring rolls, which were amazing. I had the chicken golden curry. My friend had seafood green curry. Both were incredibly flavorful and the right amount of spice. A modern family-run place. Would definitely go back if I was from the area! The only problem, albeit a minor one, was that I wasn't familiar with the layout of the complex and couldn't find it. Weird set up. I actually had to call (I was on the wrong side)."}
{"text":"This is a great place if your looking for ambiance and good food. I came here around 2pm for a late lunch with some coworkers. I got the Red Thai Curry and it was delicious. The only think I didn't like was that the chicken had a texture like it was Boiled before hand. It didn't take away from the taste of the food but the texture was just off. I would definitely be back to this place if I was craving thai food :)"}
{"text":"Our first visit,  service was prompt and friendly,  the restaurant very bright and clean with white linen table cloths.  We shared an appetizer plate which would easily feed 4.  The spring rolls were very good,  the calamari excellent,  crispy and full of flavour.   The beef and chicken satay tender and flavourful.  The rice paper rolls burst with flavour.   Our mains,  Basil curry red snapper,  were very large portions and the fish moist and tender,  the curry sauce adding to the flavour of the fish.   It came with curry shrimp and vegetables which were nicely done.   Pricing is reasonable and portions quite generous.   None of the food was greasy,  salty or over spiced,  rather it was fresh and full of taste."}
{"text":"Sept.9/11. DO NOT go to this place if you have a voucher.  Total bait-n-switch operation. Went to this place today for lunch with some co-workers.  Place is decent enough, but service was terrible.  We waited for over 30min for our food.  Food took so long that one of our friend had to leave to go back to work 'cause his lunch hour was up.  Food was so-so, nothing to write home about.  What's more, when we tried to pay our $66 bill (this was for lunch for 4 ppl BTW, so regular price is not cheap by any mean) with a voucher, waitress/owner refused to take it saying that voucher is only valid for dinner.  Nothing of this sort was printed on the voucher.  It appears like they sold the voucher, pocketed the money and refuse to honor it.  What a total scam!  I will be writing to Dealfind to get my money back.  Do not go to this place.  Very dishonest people.  And they're not even Thai - so you know that food is not authentic."}
{"text":"The lunch special is fantastic even if the service can be a little slow when it gets busy. Sometimes the food is a little different from day-to-day (Basil fish!).  Dishes I would recommend: Red curry, green curry, the pho, goat curry, pumpkin curry soup, bangkok street style pad thai.  Skip: Basil eggplant, regular pad thai"}
{"text":"This is my current favourite Thai place in the West end. I have been here for lunch once and multiple times for dinner and it is consistently great. I have been to Thailand several times so I know how pad thai should taste.  The Bangkok street style pad thai at Twin Fish is pretty close to the real thing - excellent flavour and texture.  It is a very popular lunch spot with a lot of office buildings close by, so yup, you may have to wait for a seat.  $10 lunch specials - pad thai with viet style grilled chicken on top and mango salad on the side - so good.  Value and portion size are very good here.  The service has always been good for me here.  I see the owner go around to all the tables and personally ask how everything was at dinner time.  I hope this place stays around for a long time!"}
{"text":"I came here with two of my friends on a Tuesday before a movie at AMC. At first, I was skeptical that our table would be neglected as it was a booth located in the corner of the restaurant. In the contrary, the service was great and food came quickly (around 10 minutes after we ordered).   I have mixed ratings when it comes to their food as it depends on what dish you order. The 'favourite dishes' have the twin fish icon beside them on the menu. My friends and I all ordered 'favourites'. One friend ordered the Thai salad, which was great. I had the Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai with the addition of chicken, which I thought was mediocre because I've had better pad Thai elsewhere (Salad King). I believe my other friend ordered some type of Thai Spicy noodles, which he also thought was 'okay'. We also got an appetizer called Crispy Nest Roll that came with a dipping sauce, which I thought was quite similar to a Vietnamese spring roll. This appetizer was very tasty and I would definitely reorder this appetizer if I return to this restaurant.  Pros:   - Location of the restaurant is great and is in the same plaza, which is a walking distance (1 minute) from the movie theatre AMC  - Service was quick and friendly   Price:  mediocre"}
{"text":"You got to eat here!!!  We visited this restaurant before & after Niagara Falls trip.  The Red Snapper Fillet with Basil Sauce is amazing, we also like the Garlic Shrimp & Fried Rice with Crab meat.  It's too bad that we have to leave..."}
{"text":"Love their food.  Our all time favorites are the tom ka gai, red snapper with basil sauce ( can't find it anywhere else)  and the penang curry.  Service is also good.  This place lives up to its hype.  Absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great staff - always pleasant and very accommodating. Food is always good. The red snapper is thai basil sauce is a must!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night with another couple. It wasn't very busy at all when we went in so we were seated immediately in a nice corner booth. We took forever to look at, and pick apart the menu. The waitress was SO patient with us. She came back several times and patiently answered all our questions about the food and possible substitutions or not. She was absolutely lovely!   The food was mostly great. To start we shared Thai Vegetable Spring Rolls and for the main we ordered the Thai Basil Eggplant and Tofu Cashew Nut. The Thai Basil Eggplant was probably one that I would not recommend. At most Thai restaurants, I quite like it, but here it was just bland and quire tasteless.  The Tofu Cashew Nut on the other hand was great! I love cashews and if you do too, definitely get this dish. For dessert I had the ginger ice cream. I love ginger and I love ice cream. I wasn't quite sure how the two would pair together, but this turned out to be a delightful little combination. I highly recommend it.  The food was good and decently prices and the service was amazing! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I come here every few months, amazing food!  The spicy food does give you the poops! so if you cant handle the spice, don't order it spicy"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for quality tasty Thai food! The management and staff are great, always helpful and pleasant. You won't regret eating here."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch and I was worried we wouldn't have enough time to eat and get back on the road for work. But surprisingly, we were in and out within 45 minutes or so...despite the place being quite full!   There is a short lunch menu but it covers the usual suspects like curry,  pad thai,  and some stir fry's.   Food is great, tasty and quick.  Service is friendly and swift.  For a quick lunch that doesn't involve paper plates or brown bags,  try Twin Fish! I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing service by our server Jimmy! Great food that comes in considerable portions. Would recommend to anyone and will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a large Thai lemongrass soup w vegetables to go, paid $10 and when I got back to work it was broth and vegetables. No noodles. I called them to ask and they told me the soup only has noodles Monday to Friday for lunch. Wtf? I could have gone to Freshii and got a soup for less WITH NOODLES! Never going back."}
{"text":"Wow. What a delicious meal! Family style is the only way to go when there are so many great dishes to try. We had the panang curry, general tsao chicken and Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai. Yum yum. Our new place for Thai and a great spot."}
{"text":"Honestly the best thai place ive been to in my life... It makes getting thai express look like getting those frozen asian tv dinners from the supermarket... The service was amazing, not to say that the owner herself was also serving us... The food was not only delicious with authentic flavours and unique hints of their own creativity, but the presentation itself was also astounding. The aura of the restaurant was also excellent, overall an amazing design and atmosphere. I NEVER go to asian resaturants for the fear of poor quality food, terrible service, and disastrous settings, but hands down not only is Twin Fish the best thai/asian restaurant ive been to, but probably my top 10 quality restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great little place. Seating for about 50 at most. You can hear them cooking in the wok in back and my meal was ready very fast but when I arrived at about 5:45 pm I was the only one here. Although I was going to come last night and it was full at 7. Quick and friendly service and the portions were decent so I thought the prices were good. Nice decor and very clean. Run by a family I think."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today with a couple of people. We ordered cold rolls, spring rolls, and I ordered the green curry as my main.   Firstly, the decor is nice and modern, but it does feel a bit cramped because the tables are pretty close together and this restaurant was jampacked with people at tables and people waiting around for a table to open up.  Service was nice and friendly. The food was very generously portioned and quite yummy. I loved the cold rolls particularly. I would come again just for those. The green curry had a nice amount of medium heat. I was impressed."}
{"text":"We were in the West end of the city and felt like eating Thai food. TwinFish had food reviews so we thought we would try it out.  We lucked out on our early dinner, because there were line ups to get in within 30 minutes of our arrival. Food is amazing, we tried green curry, basil shrimp and lemongrass fried rice...good food, generous helpings and very attentive servers.  Would definitely go back next time we're in that part of town."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. It was excellent and catered to my Thai cravings.  Ordered an appetizer of calamari. It came in fairly large, whole chunks (not rings like Italian-style) and lightly breaded. Upon first glance it seemed really fried, but it was actually light/refreshing and not really greasy. The breaded parts fell apart in your mouth and all that was left was chunks of squid-y goodness.   Had the Bangkok Style Pad Thai (choice of beef, chicken, or tofu & vegetables - I got the latter). Recommend! I always get this because only relatively authentic Thai restaurants will have it. Good portion size. Not as saucy and salty as I expected but taste was still there nonetheless.   Highlight of the meal was PANANG (peanut) CURRY which I ordered with chicken (same choices as pad thai). OH EM GEE. If you're not allergic to peanuts, this is the best curry I've tried. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The server suggested it to me and I fell in love upon first bite. The red curry flavor and nutty aromatics of chopped peanuts bursted my mouth with a ton of flavor and heat. I could eat this curry all day. It's surprising the both of these go so well together and it doesn't come with any vegetables, but damn, it is a real treat  to your tastebuds. More rice was needed as curry was too good.  At the end of the meal, BLOATED. Pretty much fell into itis mode and had to doggy pack it home. Appetizer is not needed as entrees are generous. Would happily visit again as nice atmosphere, had a server who was knowledgeable about recommendations, and reasonably priced for good portions of relatively authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Not sure about the dine-in experience, but this place is not that good for take-out. Portion sizes are tiny for what you pay.   I ordered the Bangkok street style pad Thai with veggies and tofu (~$15). It was filled with crisp veggies but some of them were an unusual choice for pad thai (ie. cauliflower, bell peppers).  The noodles were cooked well but tasted quite bland - I could barely taste the lime-tamarind flavour it was supposed to have. The dish also only came with 2 tofu pieces.   Two stars for the interior and fast service but I would not go back again. For me, if a Thai restaurant can't master the very basics like pad Thai, it's not worth going to."}
{"text":"First time here and I was very surprised. I thought because it was in a movie complex it wouldn't be that good but they proved me wrong.   My must try is the Satay Chicken, and they blow me away. Great spices, nice crispness and so flavorful. Highly recommended.  It was lunch so I didn't eat as much as usual to try a big variety. So they only other thing I can comment on is the Tom Yom Soup. Big portion and just the right about of spices. Great mix of noodles, vegetables and broth.   If your in the area and want a great lunch or even dinner coming here is a great idea. Definitely a must try    The restaurant itself is not big but hold a good amount of people. Beautiful decor and nice atmosphere.   I for one will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place, what a location close to a movie Cineplex and right in front of a dessert place. This is just too good, great service, lovely ambience and awesome food! I had the basil chicken soup with kafir lime which was simply beautiful, that's the only way to describe it - tangy, chicken chunks, flavorful broth and great but with the mushrooms as well.  Then I was told not to worry that I will be surprised by the choice of roll they pick out for me and I was. It was a sharp birds nest roll and wow, what a presentation, plus taste was very balanced. I also had the kaffir line soup which had its own powerful taste and the delicate rolls went perfectly with it.  For entree I had the red snapper in basil Sauce. A batter fried fillet of red snapper with a bowl of rice. The fish is I. A thick sauce of veggies, basil and some shrimp. Although I wouldn't have preferred a fried fish, but it wasn't bad. The thick batter held well on its own in the gravy and didn't become soggy. So gave a nice crunch to the dish. Overall, nothing but a 5 star!!  Also they don't accept Amex"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai and Vietnamese cuisine, curries are made fresh and service is excellent.  Veg, fruit and herbs are super fresh and delish"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was great... it's a bit tight but enough place to feel comfortable.. I got the pad Thai and it was one of the best plates I had. Service was great and my family and I enjoyed everything"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I've been twice now. I should go more often, but I sometimes forget it exists because it's kind of out of my way... a bit of a drive from home.   The atmosphere is lovely, staff are friendly and the food is delicious. I haven't had anything yet that I didn't like.   I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I did not like this place at all.  First of all the chicken was not fresh.  And the noodles we ordered tasted frozen.  The presentation was fine until you put the food in your mouth.  This is the second time I have been here and I found the meat not fresh.  Needless to say I won't be spending my well earned money for frozen noodles and not fresh meats."}
{"text":"Very good food, albeit some slow service...we ordered green curry, noodles and fried rice...so good...will come again"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in Mississauga! It's owned by a cute family and it's a very welcoming, intimate and family-owned business and you can tell they put their heart and soul into it. I go time and time again and the owners know us. I've been going there since they first opened and I'm happy to see the business grow into a busy location.  Overall: wonderful service and great food!"}
{"text":"Came with my colleagues, amazing food! tried the coconut soup, can't ask for a better one. this time on to the tom yum soup :p"}
{"text":"Very rude and unwelcoming owner. We ordered vegetarian lemon grass soup and it came with fish sauce and chicken broth. And when we politely asked the server about the food the owner showed up and very rudely told us that it has chicken broth and fish sauce and nowhere in Toronto will you ever find a vegetarian Thai soup. I told him this is not the first Thai place we have been to and that we clearly requested vegetable broth and no fish sauce which was acknowledged and assured by the server. We were insulted in return.   I am giving an additional one star only because the customer relations manager came By and apologized to us and in fact give us the remainder of our food for free."}
{"text":"Basil beef was really tasty. Veggies were fresh. The food came out quickly. This place has a nice ambiance. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Not easy to find but worth it! Nice atmosphere, clean. Pleasant staff. Good menu selection. Great flavors. Thai coconut soup is awesome! Lemongrass beef was very good too. Will make this a regular stop when in the area."}
{"text":"Amateur hour here, poor service and poor quality preparation.  The Vietnamese spring rolls were flavorless and bland.  The waiter did not write our orders down and managed to screw them both up.   The biggest disappointment was my South Thai Lamb Curry , I was expecting tasty pieces of lamb in a masaman curry sauce, instead I received a lamb shank perched on top of a thick sauce which as I tried to cut the lamb off managed to splash the sauce all over the table. The menu did not mention it was a lamb shank!!  Vietnamese iced coffee that we ordered at the start of the meal , took nearly twenty minutes too arrive.  Overall a shambles of a meal."}
{"text":"I kid you not, this is my all-time favourite Thai restaurant. All the employees are so welcoming and so kind, the service was just purely amazing. Such a comfortable atmosphere as well. The food is beyond amazing but it might be a tad pricey for the portion size. The mango salad and Pad Thai are my absolute favourite because those dishes are always bursting in bold flavours."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family for about a year and a half.  Service: Great, the waiters are always courteous and accommodating. Food can take a little long sometimes with a larger group but nothing to worry about.  Food: The Red Snapper is some of the best fish I've ever had (get it with curry on it). The Pad Thai is good but I prefer a more spicier and curried Pad Thai. Their soups are about average. All in all, I would recommend to stick with curry's and rices (apart from the snapper)."}
{"text":"I went to Twin Fish twice, once for a friends birthday and lately right before watching a movie. This place seemed quiet, but nice and clean. The server was very polite, I ordered green thai curry and garlic beef. It was delicious and the portion sizes are huge lol. I would go back to try other things on the menu. Check it out :)"}
{"text":"What a difference a few months makes. On my first few visits, it would be a five out of five.  The service tonight was terrible, my husbands food came out ten minutes before mine, the mango salad was very spicy ( I usually order this everywhere and previously at this restaurant but this time it was just wrong ). Water glasses left empty. I received my order and had to send it back because of huge chunks of raw garlic.  What the heck guys? So disappointed. You used to be so great. I'm going to try coming here a few more times because I want to believe this is an off night."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, amazing menu selection.. So friendly and hospitable.. Once you become a regular the staff greet you with a handshake, which is very warm and makes you feel at home.. The food is delicious and there is something for everyone.. And the portions are quite big..This place is a hidden gem and I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"I really, REALLY wanted to like this place. After reading good reviews combined with a craving for Thai, I came to try it out. When I opened the menu, the listed dishes all sounded so good that I immediately started mentally planning what I would order in my subsequent visits. I decided to order some basics because you can't go wrong with pad Thai, Thai iced tea, and mango sticky rice, right?  Starting with the drink, I noticed Thai iced tea was not on the menu so I inquired about it. My waiter confirmed that they did serve it even thought it was not on the menu. He mentioned they served it with a scoop of ice cream on top, which I was surprised about because I have never heard of Thai iced tea being served with that. I asked him to omit the ice cream. When the drink first arrived, it was not the bright orange to milky white gradient I was used to, but rather a vanilla looking milky drink. That should have been my first warning sign. I took a sip and it tasted a little like watered down chai tea. Not to be deflated, I just shrugged it off and awaited my entree with much optimism as I was rather hungry.  The dish came out very aesthetically crafted. That was where he good ended. The pad Thai sauce was an overwhelmingly sweet flavor that bordered on sour. It overshadowed every other flavor on the dish. There was a small pule of crushed peanuts on the side and a tentative taste confirmed it to be a dry, stale constitution. Mixing it in with the noodles only produced an overly sweet stale peanuty taste. Forging ahead, I took a bite of the shrimp and found it to be a very fishy somewhat undercooked taste. And the entire dish only had three pieces of shrimp. Very underwhelming.  I should have stopped there but like I said, I was determined to like this place so I went ahead and ordered a mango sticky rice dessert. I crossed my fingers for the best, and then promptly gave up when it arrived with black rice instead of the familiar white rice. The mangoes tasted a little sour. Surprisingly, the rice (which I later researched to be black glutinous rice)  wasn't too bad. However, when paired with the mangos, the two tastes clashed rather than complimented.   That aside, the interior decor was a nice, soothing ambient feel set with dimmed lights and candles. Everything was very clean and both of the waiters I saw were so incredibly friendly and sweet. The low rating was purely reflective of the food and not of the vibe."}
{"text":"What a fantastic dining experience we had here today. Read some good reviews and wanted to give the place a try and we were not disappointed. The decor was lovely, service excellent and friendly. The food was delicious and came out in good time. Would definitely put this place up there with some of the best downtown Thai food establishments. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 3.5 stars. I got the Beef Glass Noodles. The food was tasty but it had a very strong taste of...I'm not sure... maybe it was the fish sauce or the beef seasoning. It overpowered the dish for sure. The restaurant itself had very nice decor and the waitress was lovely."}
{"text":"Can't understand the people who give ratings based on only one visit, only one or two dishes.  While we came here only once today for lunch, the group of us sampled the Twin Fish Thai Platter, which covered most of their appetizers--Spring roll, chicken & beef satay, calamari, chef cold roll & shrimp chips, as well as two of their sauces--peanut & Thai sweet garlic chili sauce, as well as several of their mains--green chicken curry, red chicken curry, panang chicken curry, shrimp pad thai, and their South Thai lamb curry.    The food rivals or betters MANY of the best places in Toronto, where I live, and the only place that I like better in Toronto is Pai, on Duncan (although I still have to try Mengrai).    The appetizers:  spring roll was deep fried, veggie filled, and the dipping sauce went well with it--could have used more flavour.  The two satays were very tasty, didn't even need any dipping sauces, and perfectly grilled.  The battered, fried calamari were delicious, a nice and mildly spicy alternative to Mediterranean-style calamari--probably the best of the apps.  The cold roll had a lot of chicken in it, and went well with the dipping sauces.  The shrimp chips were tasty, but nothing special.    On to the mains:  Portions were more than adequate in all cases--as an Asian, I could have used more rice, but we all agreed that the coconut rice was definitely a much better option over plain.  It wasn't too cloying or clumpy like some places make it.  Rave reviews for the green chicken and panang chicken curries--just the right amount of heat in both cases.  I ordered the South Thai lamb curry, and when the server warned me that it was a lamb shank with bone, I was all the more excited to eat it!  I love lamb on the bone, whether it's in an Italian, Somali, or Thai restaurant.  I anticipate slow cooked, fall-off-the-bone lamb meat, and I was NOT disappointed!  The savoury sauce was so good I was tempted to drink the leftovers.  This was actually the first time I've ever seen this on a menu in a Thai restaurant!  The server also said it would be a mild curry, so I asked if she could get the kitchen to make it spicier--they did so, to my delight!  Overall, we all really enjoyed the flavours, heat levels, service, and even the teas were great!  The only reason I deducted a star was it doesn't rank up there with the creativity I see in the menu at Pai, but definitely a pleasant surprise on a quiet afternoon in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Live up to expectations. Service and food are good. Me and my friend had a good time there. We happened to celebrate 3 birthdays in one night. Pretty cool experience."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to! Everyone at our table ordered different things and left happy as hell. LOVED the South Asia Lamb Curry, but the menu is packed with amazing options that I know I can't go back to that dish again."}
{"text":"Enjoyable Thai food.  Some dishes stand out over others--the cashew chicken is one of the best in the area we found the Massaman curry a bit too sweet.  We ordered the crispy spring rolls for the appetizer, which we  really enjoyed. The fish dishes are excellent-- however I would love the option to have the fish not breaded--especially when ordering multiple fish dishes.  Portion sizes are reasonable and two people could easily share one entree.  Service was very slow--due to the fact they appeared to only have two servers handling dozens of tables."}
{"text":"I came here twice in the past 3 years. Once for Saturday lunch and once for Friday dinner. The food and the service were great although one time they were very busy with a big group of people. I had mixed vegetable and shrimp spring rolls, both tasted good with reasonable price."}
{"text":"Unfortunately every time I have been here, I have gotten the same thing. -_- But fortunately, there's a reason!  The Bangkok Pad Thai here is simply amazing.  I possibly dare say one of the best in Mississauga!  The price is higher than usual places but the portions make up for it.  The noodles are the perfect consistency (that actually blows my mind).  And the flavor tastes so authentic.  I had a serving, and then another half because my wife had not finished hers.  I was so full but my mouth kept wanting more.  My mouth is salivating from just writing this review to a point I am almost embarrassed to say.   Service was great - A couple of male servers were very friendly we had good conversations with each time we went. The ambiance was not too heavy.  A good mixture of romantic and family friendly. Location is right in the same plaza as the AMC theatre (now Famous Players). Great for date nights.   Food and movie!  Recommendation: Bangkok Pad Thai (Beef is my preference) and make it a bit spicy =)  Location 5/5 Convenience 5/5 Food 5/5 service 5/5 Price 4/5 Portion 5/5"}
{"text":"Awesome food. We ordered green chicken curry and shrimp noodles. The curry was yummy. Though the food was not freshly prepared . It arrived at our table in less than 3 minutes of ordering and became cold in under 5 minutes. Overall a decent experience. It was very crowded and you could hear the table adjacent to you more than people on your table . There was a huge line up so get there early . Must try..."}
{"text":"Headliner: Great food, terrible service, not recommended for takeout.  Last visit: November 2013   I ordered the sweet and sour red snapper Thai.  The fish itself was nicely breaded and the sweet and sour sauce was delectable.  However, my dislike is the following:  a) They charged me for rice and I never got it b) Even though I called in 15 minutes in advance, it still took an additional 10 minutes to prepare.  Verdict: Might return, but dine-in only.  Not sure about their takeout anymore."}
{"text":"After trying a couple of Thai restaurants in Mississauga, we got invited to TF.  Started with a Thai style Iced Tea, some Veggie Spring Rolls, a Thai Lemongrass Soup (Tom Yum) and a Mango Salad.   I have never tried Iced Tea, Thai style and was quite surprised with the flavour. Sweet Tea, Coconut Milk and perhaps sweetened condensed milk. Delicious. Ask for a little less ice.   The mango salad was usual. The mango sweet and sour, mint, cashew nuts and the right amount of dressing.   The veggie spring rolls were crisp and well filled with veggies. The dipping sauce way too mild for me but there is nothing that Sriracha cannot fix.   The Tom Yum was a bit too mild for us, but the flavour was good. Needed a bit more heat in it.   After the appetizers, we ordered a Green Curry with Coconut Rice,  Masaman Curry with steamed rice and a Lemongrass Fried Rice.   The Green Curry hit the right notes of flavour and heat. The curry smooth and filled with Coconut Milk. The rice could have used a bit more coconut milk while cooking. The Masaman Curry - never had a Thai Curry with potatoes, was good, but the potatoes spoilt the taste for me. The Lemongrass Fried Rice was unique. Always had a Basil Fried Rice, but this was unique. Much much milder flavour and good if you are looking for a change from the usual.   The service excellent, friendly and helpful. The atmosphere good. There is construction going outside, so the signs are a bit hard to see outside.   Fancy and recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with great friendly staff.  It's casual enough for family but the decor also lends itself to a date night place. Prices are very reasonable. The food was ok. I had the Tom Yum soup to start that was delicious but the pineapple fried rice was just fair. The shrimp still had the tails on them. & the rice was dry. Also the wine list is very thin, they were out of the Pinot noir I wanted.   If half stars were an option I'd give them 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Hallelujah!!! The cooks at this Thai place must be expert...because the Thai red curry with Shrimp was on point!!! Blessed.  I tried the special fish and it was awesome as well. They know how to spice the food to satisfy the spice lover . just ask kindly.  The setting is DIVINE. The artwork on the walla are impeccable...and the service is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Had the calamari salad, shrimp rolls, basil shrimp (spicy), garlic lamb and crab fried rice. Food was delicious. Flavours were very well balanced and enjoyed every dish. Service was warm and friendly but the place was jammed by 7:30pm and the staff was overwhelmed resulting in very slow service. Not sure if it is normally this busy but if it is come early and avoid the rush. The food is definitely worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  This is my new favourite Thai place. Will definitely go again.  We started with the soups - comes in an individual bowl, very cute.   Veggie tom yum and hot and sour soup - both were fantastic. Very flavourful and not too salty.  Chef's roll - HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I had it with chicken. The sauce is excellent and I just love those rice paper wrapped spring rolls. They are so refreshing and don't feel like they sit at the bottom of your stomach for the rest of the evening.  Now, I like my food SPICY. So upon recommendations from our lovely and cute waiter, I ordered the curry noodles. It wasn't that spicy. The dish was delicious, perhaps a little sweeter than I would have preferred but it was not spicy enough. They had a great oil hot sauce that was magical when I loaded it onto my noodles. I ordered it with shrimp - very satisfied with the noodle and shrimp/tofu ratio.  Finally, and this really was THE best part of the meal. Sticky rice in coconut milk with mango. First, the rice is black rice and cooked to a perfect al dente. Second, the mango was just before that over-ripened stage and was super sweet. I just wish I had more room to finish it. So sad.  Presentation and service were exceptional. I always find food tastes better when it's pleasing to the eye as well.  Until next time, chopsticks hi-ya!"}
{"text":"First time visitor here!   I was honestly very surprised when I walked in. A friend recommended that we go here for dinner since she's been here so much. She raves about it. I remember hearing about this place once or twice but never thought much about it.  I walked in to this very clean, very modern looking restaurant. Dinner tables were lined with tablecloths. And paper! For easy clean up :) The cutlery rolls were wrapped nicely in cloth as well. The chairs were comfy - and leather! Very chic.   We were seated near the window but since the sun was beaming down and we were there, we were really hot. Sweating to death. So we asked if we could sit at another table and they obliged immediately! +1 for them!   My friend ordered the new udon dish. It was really good and had a nice herby presence. It wasn't overpowering and honestly very delicious. The noodles were cooked nicely and flavours came together nicely.  I ordered the specialty rice - it's the shrimp paste one with a lot of seafood. From the pricing, I thought they would skimp on the seafood - shrimp, scallops, mussels, etc. But no! Every bite of rice I had was accompanied nicely with seafood! Oh my goodness, it was like tasting heaven itself. Really, really delicious.   I also had the vietnamese iced coffee. I am Vietnamese myself and I was a bit skeptical but I wanted a caffeine boost. Absolutely delicious! Maybe a little less sugar (condensed milk?) would make it taste better but I really couldn't complain. I have a sweet tooth :)   My friend is a regular and they said, \"Welcome back!\" to her, which was pleasant. I saw another regular receiving a hug from a server and saw them exchanging kind words.  Very, very pleasant atmosphere, service and food. Looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Was craving for pad Thai so gave this spot a try before the movie. Which we didn't have much time before the movie started. The waitress&owner that was helping us, was very sweet. Talked us into trying Thai curry. Turned out to be a very good choice. But unfortunately, the pad Thai was just okay to me."}
{"text":"We've been to Twin Fish now about five times, and every time I am there I am even more impressed.  The food is always hot and fresh, the atmosphere is very relaxing and the servers are incredibly friendly and attentive.  The Panang Curry is fantastic!  Just the right amount of heat and flavoured beautifully.  We are also a huge fan of the Bangkok Street Pad Thai.  We've also had the General Tao Chicken, the glass noodles and a number of the curry dishes.  The Pumpkin Curry Soup is lovely and the Tom Yum Soup is terrific as well.  I would also recommend the Calamari as an appetizer or the Satay skewers.  I can honestly say I have not had a dish that I didn't enjoy.  The owners have done a wonderful job of balancing authentic  Thai food in a friendly, relaxing and slighty upscale atmosphere.  If you live in the Brampton, Mississauga are or any part of the western GTA, it is definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Cold roll is simply delicious, hot and sour soup was good but I'be had better. Tiger shrimp pad Thai was fantastic, cooked to perfection, would have prefer more than 4 tiger shrimps though. Will definitely come back again. Servers were very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. The place wasn't too pack on a weekday and was able to accommodate our large group of 8. Our server was prompt and helpful in accommodating for diet restrictions and offering suggestions. This could be a good place for lunch meetings.    Typically, I only order curry at Thai restaurants but was recommend the Thai basil red snapper. I can definitely say it lives up to the hype. It didn't taste overly fishy. The fish was very tender and the crust was perfection. The crust wasn't too thick and provided excellent texture to the dish. If the fish alone wasn't outstanding, the basil sauce at the bottom added an explosion of flavour giving it a sweet taste. I was extremely impressed and would not hesitate to order it again. I would definitely seek this restaurant out and look forward to trying the curries at my next visit."}
{"text":"Had high expectations with all the reviews but this isn't \"amazing\" by any stretch.   We got the tiger shrimp to start, which were delicious. We ordered the green curry which was very good, and lemongrass lamb which had a lot of gristle and a sugary sauce I didn't care for.   The only vegetables in both dishes were onions and bell peppers. Both dishes had onion peel and inedible kaffir leaf pieces.   We also didn't get greeted/seated right away (just stood at the door as servers minded their business for a few minutes)."}
{"text":"Went here for a Valentine's dinner, and it turned out to be a disaster, the manager/owner is not only rude, but abusive and aggressive. Wife and i both ordered entree's with shrimps. The food arrived and the shrimps had the veins in them. Called the server and asked them to take it back, that's when this old bald guy came, and asked what's wrong, you can eat shrimps with veins in them, you wont die, we told him that we dont prefer it like that, would like it if it were clean. That's when he went berserk and we had to leave the place. Never going there again, asking everyone to stay away from this mad house.."}
{"text":"Plus:  Clean and nice decor Serving staff are helpful Food has good visual presentation  Con:  Food taste is somewhat good or OK (I ordered the chicken Pad thai noodle). The food looks great especially with mango salad, but surprisingly the PT noodle was fairly tasteless.  It was somewhat dry and lacking flavor.   I would have preferred PT noodle that looks ordinary with extraordinary taste.  My friend ordered a fish dish.  It was small in size and taste was borderline acceptable.  At least my dish looked great.  Christian music is rather loud.  I respect the owner's religion but keeping the music so loud made me feel like I was at church, and that is probably the effect the owner intended.  Verdict:  I would recommend this place, as overall, it offers a pleasant experience and viable dining option in Mississauga.  But this place is no mecca of Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Been here a few more times this year. Best service in mississauga and maybe even toronto ' s thai restaurants. They know my nephew by name and move tables and chairs around to accommodate.    Red snapper is crisp moist and delicious! I don't feel like too much salt in everything and don't feel heavy when I leave.  Love the desserts too! Definitely worth the visit :)"}
{"text":"Hearty meal if you're having the pho.  Seems popular with lots of regulars.   Friendly service.  Decent value."}
{"text":"I ordered general tso's chicken, it does not come with rice.  Rice is $3 extra.  The chicken was too sweet, and just ok.  Definitely not worth the price.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Thursday June Fourth. I, with good reason, finally make it to Twin Fish. The good reason, It is my first man date. Seriously. A meeting between two male strangers in a highly reviewed Thai restaurant.  Ok, you must be wondering why I would meet a male stranger in a Thai restaurant. Well, let's all go back a couple months ago.   Rivergrove Community Centre Pool. I was taking a break from swimming laps in the pool when I was approached by this individual who entertained me in conversation regarding my underwater headset.  This pool side encounter prompted an awkward in change room conversation regarding this and that and well,, we exchanged cell phone numbers. In the change room!!!???  No,, we didn't talk in the shower or towel whip one one another either.  To tell you all the truth, I didn't expect anything to come from this awkward meeting but he called me a week later. We exchanged texts even made some attempts at meeting at the pool for lane swims. But alas, to both our dismay, nothing came of it up until two weeks ago!!!!  To my surprise I had just missed a call from my stranger buddy, but no voice mail. So what does Benny do?  I call him back and leave a voice mail.  Well, a week goes by with no response  and out of the blue, while snugglin in bed with my Baes, he calls. Omg,,,,.  Should I answer or should I just let it go to voice?!?!  I answer.  We exchange pleasantries, send texts back and forth to one another, and to sum it up, a lunch date is set. Twin Fish here I come!!   Back to the present. It is one o'clock, I enter the restaurant and I am immediately surprised with the restos contemporary design and crowd. I was bit jaded when I initially walked up to the place but was proved wrong.  I quickly eyeball the patrons seated in the resto but do not see my stranger buddy. Anywho, I am promptly greeted by a host. He inquires as to my table requirements and I proudly state, \" a table for two please, I am meeting someone here\". One fifteen. I have strategically seated myself so I can see all who enter the restaurant. Fashionably late I think to myself. I order a Thai Beer - Singha. Well, two beers later and on an empty stomach,,, wait,,,,,, cue music, All by Myself - Eric Carmen version please.   \"When I was young, I never needed anyone,,,,,All by myself, don't wanna be, all by myself, anymore\".    My text to my stranger buddy read as follows, \"I want to think that you are running late, but on this fine afternoon, optimism is not one of my strong suits\".  Cue music,,,,,   \"All by myself, don't wanna be,,,,\".   I call the host and and advise him that I would be dining alone today. Lmfao. I was ditched. Left for dead. I must Yelp this. Lol.   My order from the Lunch Express Menu:  one Mango Salad w/Chicken Satay and to wash that down with, one Basil Fish please and thank you. OMG. Mango Salad w/Chicken Satay.  Soooo good.  Chicken moist and so delicious combined with peanut sauce. Mango Salad portion was huge and so tasty. I only wish it had more heat to it. Next time I will ask for Thai Spicy and see what they come out with. The Basil Fish. Kudos to the chef. He has come up with a winner here. I ate slowly and savoured each heavenly bite.   The Snapper was breaded and cooked to perfection. All the elements, from the basil sauce to the peppers, in this dish melded together in perfect harmony.  Oh man. My only beef with Twin Fish was the daily soup that came with my Basil Fish dish. Pituey!  Augh!  .  Hot and Sour my battie-ol!  I ate it all anyways.  Lol.  . BTW. Wifi password is, \"godblessyou\".  Peace out my fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"We took my fianc√©'s mom here for her belated birthday meal and had a lovely time.Every dish we tried was delicious. Service was a bit slow but we weren't in a big rush so we didn't mind too much.  We ordered a bunch of items to share around the table : Thai sampler platter (yum), grilled beef salad (very flavourful), coconut soup (so good, one of my all time Thai faves), hot n sour soup (yummy), cashew chicken (delish), green Thai curry (most spicy, my fave dish of the evening), and the fried fish with basil (absolutely delicious).  One thing to note : if you sit near the door, be prepared for a few gusts of wind as people enter and exit the restaurant.  Pro tip : tell your server someone is celebrating a birthday and chances are they will be serenaded with an awkwardly loud song accompanied by a recorded piano - so awesome!! They also brought out an order of their fried banana for us to enjoy after the amazing performance, yay!"}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in mississauga and Brampton area. I have frequented it every week when I worked in the area and still make it a point to go back once a month. The red Thai curry and BBQ chicken pad Thai both are both to die for."}
{"text":"Food is great here. Really fresh and you can tell it's not processed. I just wish the service was a little better. It's in an isolated place, but the good is top notch! Try the lunch menu. Great value for your money."}
{"text":"Fantastic surprise!  In town for business and stopped in!  Not a negative comment to make!    Tom Yum on of the best I have ever tasted.  Chicken safe juicy and well flavored.   Garlic beef perfect"}
{"text":"Had a great meal! Came at 7:30 on a Saturday now got, and it was very busy, but the wait wasn't long, was able to get a table within 15-20 mins. There's enough seating but the tables are quite close together, so be prepared to manoeuvre with stealth.  We ordered the chicken satay and fresh rolls to start. Satay was tender, but didn't have the peanut dipping sauce, instead had a tamarind sauce. It was still tasty, but I would have preferred the peanut sauce. Fresh rolls were delicious and veggies were nice and crisp. For entrees we had the red snapper with thai basil sauce and a spicy beef curry. The snapper was delicious! Crispy fried but not oily or greasy feeling. Was impressed that they used oyster mushrooms and green beans and other vegetables of good quality (usually you get filler like peppers and onions). The curry was delicious and comforting. I'm Indian so I would say that it was a medium for me, but I'm pretty accustomed to spice.  I'll definitely come back, there's more that I want to try from their menu"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other...glad to see that there is a thai place that has opened up within reasonable proximity to my office :)  The decor is really nice.  That having been said, it's pretty good value to find myself seating in front of a well-priced lunch menu - for $10, I was served a generous portion of golden curry (I think I might have even gotten a spring roll).  Great place if you want to get out of the office and experience a seren"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food and a cosy environment makes this place stand out from the rest of the restaurants in the area. Went here with the family a couple of times and always received stellar service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hiding in the middle of the plaza. It wasn't easy to find it for first comers if you drive to this plaza if you are not familiar here.  Other than the location, I like everything they have here, the waiters are friendly and they offer not just the regular Thai food, but also their special dishes.  I had the Thai Spicy Noodles with chicken and shrimps. I have to admit that I am impressed by the taste compared to the price for the dish. The dish had a good portion and full of vegetables and the meat. The sauce is so flavorful, mixed with sweet and spicy flavors.   The waiters are friendly and efficient, with the smile on all time. I say it definitely worths your time and money for the Thai cuisine here in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Delicious beef salad and shrimp cakes for lunch today. So glad I went with my instincts and made a meal of two apps.   Fresh, slight spicy and well balanced. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good tasty food except disappointed the main entr√©es don't  come with plain white rice. Had to pay $4.00 ($2.00 each) for two small rice bowls. Have never encountered an Oriental restaurant that charges for rice, or where entr√©es don't come with rice included.  Also most places provide green tea for free. This restaurant charged for that too.  The wait staff was very friendly, but our wait girl forgot to bring us sugar we requested and we had to ask another staff member. The staff seemed overly eager to please to the point that different ones would come up and ask the same questions, even asking if we were ready to order when we had already given our order to another one!!  I ordered the Shrimp with cashews. It was very delicious and the veggies in the sauce included sweet jackfruit strips which were a delightful addition. I love jackfruit and have never had it in a restaurant dish. We also ordered the Crisp Calamari. The small quantity and the overly battered calamari was not worth the $11.00 price.  My wife had the General Tsaos chicken and said it was very good.  Overall good main entr√©es, but expensive for a not very fancy place."}
{"text":"We came here after watching a movie at Cineplex. My brother in law had come here on a date and he recommended it.   Food: I ordered the tom yum soup. I believe it's part of the appetizers but I wasn't in the mood for a full meal so I had that as my entree. It was ok. I liked how sour it was but in general nothing special. My husband and friend ordered the pad Thai. That was delicious! Full of flavour, chicken, peanuts and cilantro! I would come back for that alone. The serving size was also pretty decent.   My husband really really enjoyed his ginger tea. He said that the ginger was just the right amount. My friends also commented that their Thai coffees were delicious.   Service: I was slightly disappointed that my soup was brought out first. I should have said to bring it out with everyone else's food but sadly I did not. The worst part was that the mains didn't come out for a good amount of time so my soup was getting cold (I believe in waiting until all dishes come before eating). I noticed that others who ordered around the same time as us were receiving their dishes while we still hadn't.   Overall experience: I thought it was ok. It's slightly on the pricier side and the food wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"I've read good reviews about Twin Fish, so decided to stop by for lunch after the movies. Place is very clean and staff are very friendly. Ordered the basil Thai fried rice, lemongrass chicken, ginger beef chicken, and street style pad thai. Every single dish was very tasty and delicious. I highly recommend checking it out. Great tasting food!"}
{"text":"I usually have the same food cravings: sushi, pho and fried chicken. But when I heard we were having Thai, it hit all the right places: rice, seafood, noodles and somethin' crispy (spring rolls).  Twin Fish is located in a restaurants-only plaza outside a Cineplex. It's your typical Asian restaurant with booths and tables that can be easily moved together to fit large groups. The staff are super friendly; they serve up authentic Thai food and have a sweet playlist. I went in a group of 5 on a Saturday night and we snatched up the last table in the house. Make sure you make reservations in advance because it fills up quickly!  I tried the Bangkok street style pad thai with shrimp (wish I had been more adventurous but it was still very good) and we had calamari and black sticky coconut rice with mango to share.   My friend, who is a regular, swore by the Thai coconut soup, fresh rolls (2) and spring rolls (2) instead of ordering one large entree. The spring rolls were stuffed, fat and super crispy (based on my observation) and I had major food envy.   The prices are super reasonable and I plan on coming back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"100% the best Thai restaurant in Mississauga. Go out of your way and come here, it'll be worth it! The owners and wait staff are friendly, the food is fantastic, and you can catch a movie after dinner while you're at it :)   Here's what we ordered:  Appetizer Platter - It says it's for 4/5 people, but I think it's more for 4, especially if everyone wants to try everything. While everything tasted pretty good, nothing was spectacular (3.5/5)  Green Curry w/ Beef - Creamy and delicious, with a little bit of an extra punch from those bamboo shoots. If you're not a fan of bamboo shoots I wouldn't recommend this, but this was a real treat for me! (4/5)  Bangkok style Pad Thai - Quite average for me, but ever the crowd pleaser! (3.5/5)  Pineapple Fried Rice - So good, one of my favourite things to get at any Thai restaurant. Savoury and sweet, order this with the shrimp (4/5)  Red Snapper w/ Thai Basil - This was the home run of a dish. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, deboned, well seasoned and all around fantastic flavour. (5/5)  Make this your next food destination here in Mississauga, it's one of the best we have to offer!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a \"outdoor mall\" this is hands down the best Thai in Mississauga. Wonton soup was fresh, clean with nice king mushrooms - a great touch, red curry with beef was loaded and not skimpy like Spoon and Fork or Thai signature in Port Credit - great flavour as well. The owner Henry spoke to us and said he concentrates on freshness and cleanliness in his restaurant and it was evident when we walked in. Other Thai restaurants depend way too much on pre-made sauces - crap. Not here!! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came on a busy night where there was only two staff running the whole night. The service was good and attentive when you could get it. Unfortunately there were just to many misses.  The drinks and the food took a while to come out and many tables around us were also waiting a while. The mango salad was too raw to eat, and my friend's veggie dish had cucumbers as part of the stir fry...which is just kinda weird.  My peanut curry was flavorful, but the rice it came with was not fully cooked. The place seems like it could be a great place on a slower day but they were just was over run and everything feel apart. Too bad."}
{"text":"I was craving something sweet, sour, salty, and spicy.... Thai Food!!   I couldn't tell if this place was closed till I came a little closer and saw people dining in.   Very Friendly service! They greeted us and sat us down. It wasn't busy at all. The wall arts are pretty cool. The ambience is intimate but relaxed. You can also bring your family here for a celebratory event.   I've been here before and ordered the pad Thai, it was OK. Their fish dishes were amazing! So we went with the fried red snapper with sweet and sour sauce. We also ordered the seafood shrimp paste fried rice, calamari and chicken coconut soup.   The soup was great! Very flavorful! You can really taste the lemongrass and the sweetness of the coconut milk to balance it out. The calamari was a bit too oily for the ones that were at the bottom of the plate but the ones on top were very crispy and all were cooked to perfection, not chewy at all! The sauce that came with it is a sweet and sour almost light syrup consistency. The rice dish came and boy was it goooood! You can taste the smoky shrimp paste flavour with shrimp, squid, mussels, and crab meat (imitation kind, not a fan of that). The squid was cooked perfectly. I find that some restaurant can't pull off cooking squid perfectly on a rice dish but this place killed it. The fish has finally arrived! A nice piece of red snapper fillet!! So meaty packed full of flavour with veggies and garnished with lime (which I squeezed all over the dish) and grapefruit yum!!   Now this was my biggest mistake about what I ordered. Both dishes are so packed full of flavour, I couldn't eat much of it. It almost made every bite saltier and saltier. Next time if I order the fish, I would order plain rice! That would balance the sweet and sour fish very well instead of a fried rice type of dish. The fried rice was good on its own. The portion size was very generous on all dishes. The food came out pretty quickly.   Overall this place was great and intimate! I would come here again!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars for the food. Ordered the bangkok style pad thai and general chicken lunch special. Both were delicious and represent the bulk of the 2.5 stars. Things started out well here. Got seated right away and it was pretty empty at the late lunch time I arrived. Only two other tables and one was already served. Food came out in a reasonable time. Then I tried to pay and that was when things got weird. Our server keep disappearing to do something in the back when I already asked for the bill and our food to be packed to go. It took forever for someone to finally bring the bill and then for the debit machine. Service has to be considered from start to finish. It finished poorly and for that I will not return here. If it was a full house I would be very understanding but it was empty and I was more than patient. 2.5 ** stars for the food alone."}
{"text":"A Christian-based restaurant specializing in Thai food, I've returned several times to eat their shrimp paste fried rice, mango salad, and their deep fried red snapper entrees. The way that they've cooked the shrimp paste fried rice is a must try! I can't find another Thai place that can do it as well as they do and the red snapper (though a little bit pricier) was worth a try. The fish was fresh and the design with how they curve the tail up on the snapper makes it a little more special for the dish.  And don't forget the dessert menu - the hot mango slices with coconut milk and sticky rice is fantastic to finish off with. The dessert in my opinion wasn't too sweet and just hit the spot to end the dinner.  Would come again."}
{"text":"Great food!! I had the Bangkok street pad Thai, it's a bit greasy but very flavourful, my husband had the curry pad Thai that was very flavourful and not greasy...great chicken quality. Staff is nice but the server was eatting/sitting at a table while serving us. It was not busy at all. Lots of gluten free options."}
{"text":"Located in a nice location, near to Cineplex.  A small restaurant with pretty decent ambiance, but sitting is a bit too tightly packed for comfort zone. Service is good and prompt, friendly servers.  We had crispy calamari appetizer, which is tasty, but quantity vs price is bit stiff, 3 stars!! Had crab fried rice and spicy beef coconut curry. Yes, spicy means spicy, quite hot (spicy)!!   Overall a 3.5 star experience."}
{"text":"Food was alright, a touch on the pricey side. Service was top-notch though."}
{"text":"I was here twice in two nights for dinner. TWICE! I have literally never done that before. First night was Thai spicy noodles and shrimp roll and it was so good I came back instantly. Second night was snapper covered in basil sauce and shrimp. Very much my favorite place in the vicinity while I was traveling in the area. Service was prompt and friendly. Groups eating here were fun as well, so a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing thai resto in Mississauga. Always thought it was difficult to go downtown for good thai food and thankfully now I won't have to. Large servings, great ambiance and even better servers. It's a family owned restaurant and the staff really makes you feel welcome. The green curry is delicious and very spicy. I personally enjoyed it more than the ones I've tried in downtown Toronto. Also, the snapper is a delight to have, soft on the inside and a very crispy crust. I plan on going there again. Make a reservation because it was packed at 8:30PM on a Friday night"}
{"text":"Food is fabulous here.  Service is ok...place is usually packed when I go which is during lunch.  You almost always have to wait since it's such a popular spot and not a very big venue either.  Still, worth the wait since the food is great."}
{"text":"At first, I was kind of skeptical about this place because everytime I pass by, this place is closed or empty with no customer. Also, this time there is a sign at the front door saying they are hiring for different positions in the restaurant.  The decor are quite pretty so this is not a bad place for dating. The seats are quite comfortable because all of them are with cushions.  Services were great even there were only 3 waitresses. We asked for glasses of hot water and the water came super hot with is nice. It got a little bit busier after 7pm. Maybe ppl just got off from seeing a movie?  Food were a bit salty side but if you order a bowl of rice, it will go well together. The mango spring roll that we had was pretty good with those sour sauce. The most important part about the roll was that they are super fresh.   Overall, I will come with my friends again."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and want a quick tasty lunch go to Twin Fish.   Friendly staff, good food, nice atmosphere. Definitely your best lunch option in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, their menu is extensive and pretty authentic. I always get the coconut soup and it is by far the best I have ever had, creamy and delicious.  I have always ordered out and the service has been amazing, quick and friendly. As for the price, this seems like upscale dining and I usually pay around fifteen-twenty dollars for lunch."}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant often and we have never had a bad meal. They mention us by name say when we walk in the door and from that moment everything is PERFECT!  Service and food outstanding... price is expected for what you are served. I could not give this restaurant enough stars."}
{"text":"After many failed attempts of coming here, they were finally open. I have made trips to Mississauga on the weekends to find out that they are closed. :(  We came on Saturday around 12:30PM and were the second table there..when we left, there were about five other parties.. I guess because they are located near mostly businesses..they would get more busy on weekdays.  We ordered the Thai salad (mix of chicken, shrimp, peppers, onions), beef curry with coconut rice, chicken pad thai amongst three people.  The Thai salad was delicious, we had originally wanted mango but the server advised us that mangoes weren't in season. The Thai salad had the perfect amount of sauce and crunch..very refreshing! I would caution you regarding the stinky onion breath though!  The beef curry was amazing as well, coming from someone who normally doesn't like curry. The curry was the perfect amount of sweetness with a slight kick.. and the coconut rice was very aromatic...so much so that we had to order a second bowl of rice to finish off the curry sauce!  The pad thai was alright..nothing incredibly outstanding but still delicious!  Overall, the portions are generous and the food was great; the staff are also very friendly and helpful.. will definitely make a trip back here again!  Note: They have weekday lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - amazing service. This place never fails to hit the spot - great quality and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Been here on the new year. Nice place and food. Love the bangkok street style pad thai. Would definitly come back again."}
{"text":"Twin Fish is a Thai restaurant in Mississauga. The place is small so there are limited tables but the food is delicious. The service is excellent and they are quick to refill your water without asking (signs of truly good service). I ordered their Pad Thai and it is phenomenal. Also try their basil fish it is unexpectedly delicious. I would recommend this to others to try if you are into Thai food."}
{"text":"Tip:  If you're thinking of visiting, it may be a better idea to check this place out for lunch rather than dinner as it's a bit cheaper.  This is a popular place for lunch, due to the location, so lunch tends to have a higher turnover rate!  In between a 3-3.5*, experience fell a bit short of my expectations.  This is not the restaurant's fault, but I am not a fan of this Cineplex complex  It's just poorly designed for Southern-ON, so during the Winter months, it is such a struggle to access the restaurant.  You are literally walking through a wind tunnel that feels -10 colder than it actually is.  Twin Fish is one of those places that has been bookmarked for YEARS, but I just either decided on another place OR it was closed (Sunday) when I actually had the opportunity.  Whatever the reason, my expectations were quite high seeing the reviews on here.  Food-wise:  GOOD, most lunch items were $12.95, with the exception of the pho - $9.95.  However if I'm comparing the Pad Thai Vs. the Basil Fish, the Pad Thai was a much BETTER VALUE.    At first, I thought the server brought me the wrong order.  I thought it was General Tsao Chicken, based on the appearance.  So the description was a bit different than what I thought I anticipated.  Pan fried looked more like deep fried, think:  Sweet & Sour Pork.  The side of a wonton soup was meh.  The inside of the wontons were barely warm.  It just lacked colour and veg.  Whereas the Pad Thai came with a freakin' generous 1/4 BBQ chicken, on top of a good bed of noodles, and a fresh, bright side of mango salad.  Again, both were $12.95, yet I felt as though they weren't of even-keeled.  I ordered a Thai Honey Ginger Tea, $3, as per menu that came in a teapot.  When I got the bill, I was charged $5!  I didn't bother correcting them.  No water was ever brought to the table, until we asked, mid-way through the meal.  Buff male server was nice though.   Note:  They play contemporary Christian music in the background.  If you were never a church-goer, you probably won't notice, but it was pretty obvious to me.  Innocuous, but slightly brainwashy."}
{"text":"Good service.  Definitely not authentic Thai.  The chicken in the pad thai tasted stale, i wouldnt recommend anything with chicken.  The beef was tender, but was mehhh at best.  Not horrible, but probably wouldn't come back, i think $7.50 for a Heineken bottle is a bit much as well."}
{"text":"The food was so good! I wish I had photos because of others peoples comments regarding portions.  If only I wasn't so hungry! Their portions were very big and very filling. Their food was very delicious and the service was great! I am definitely going to go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Chicken pad thai was good, but mediocre. General tao chicken tasted like the frozen chicken (would not order again) & peanut sauce skewers were just alright. Fried calamari was also good. Service was nice & quick"}
{"text":"Maybe I hit Twin Fish on an off night? Most of the reviews here are good-to-great and my experience was \"just ok\" at best.  It started off rough with being ignored for 10+ minutes after being seated despite there only being one other table. Once our order was taken, food arrived quickly though. I ordered the green curry which was rated \"very spicy\" on the menu. Honestly, it wasn't - not even close. Frankly, the sauce was thin, lacked much in the way of flavor at all (maybe some basil, that's it) and was very, very bland. Not the nuanced, spicy dish I expected at all.  It took forever to get our plates removed and to have the bill brought but they were somewhat busier, so maybe they need more staff? The menu prices are very reasonable - I don't recall seeing anything over $20 and most things were in the $10-14 range.   Twin Fish's dining room is beautiful, with clean, modern decor. I did find the blaring Christian rock music rather off-putting though. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but it was out of place and extremely loud.   Definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Came for a birthday celebration (group of 7) & we were so impressed not only with the food but also with our server!   We ordered: -Calamari ($11) -Red snapper with Tiger Shrimps on Basil Sauce ($18) -Smoked Seafood on Shrimp Paste Rice ($13) - good for 2 -Garlic Beef -Spicy Chicken Thai Noodles   It's a classy Thai restaurant but has affordable & reasonable priced items on their menu. And on top of that, it was very flavourful, not overly salty, and very nice crust for calamari & fish fillet.   WOULD DEFINITELY COME BACK & RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS!!   and btw, they gave the birthday girl deep fried bananas for a treat! need I say more???"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, went out with a friend 4 weeks ago for lunch during weekdays! Food was terrible and i couldn't even finish my dish.   Hopefully! They bring back the passion of twin fish again. Won't go back for now!!!"}
{"text":"First visit, voucher in hand on a late Thursday evening in early January...  Staff was very gracious, and courteous. The restaurant is very inviting & very clean. Service was swift. Our meals were the perfect temperature, with just the right flavouring / seasoning.  We had the pad thai, mango salad & beef salad. The portions were large (we had to take home more than half of our entrees) & competitively priced: We had $40 to spend and made 3 relatively large meals out of it.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I finally came back to further explore the menu (last time I had shrimp curry pad Thai to go). I was absolutely blown away by the food and the service.   We had the sweetest waiter, she was very honest about her recommendations. You could tell she took pride in her job and loved the food.   To start we had fried calamari and the shrimp rolls. The fried calamari was easily the best I ever had. Super moist, tender and the coating was flavourful. I do not usually order calamari but I would order their again and again. We had the shrimp rolls which were good but the shrimp was not deveined which I do not like. The garnish of vegetable was actually dressed and tasted damn good if I do say so myself.  For my main I had the red snapper topped with vegetable and shrimp in a Thai basil sauce and a side of shrimp and chicken pineapple fried rice. I have absolutely no complaints the flavour was amazing! This officially a restaurant that I am adding in my rotation.   I tried a bit if the beef pad Thai and General Tao  chicken. Not bad but u prefer the chicken or shrimp pad Thai and the general Tao didn't blow me away but it was still good and they use white meat!"}
{"text":"With a new colleague welcomed into the team, we headed for another business lunch in the north Mississauga area.  Our last foray into Asian food was horrible (Wasabi buffet) and seeing how this shared the same parking lot, I was reminded of the last experience.  With this lunch, I can pleasantly say that my faith in local Asian restaurants is restored.  The food was good and reasonably priced and in a really nice eating environment.  The service was polite and efficient.  Is it fine dining?  Not at all .... but for a great casual meal with bright Asian flavours, this is a great spot.  Tucked into the 'restaurant row' leading to the AMC theatres, Twin Fish sticks out a bit as it has more of a modern and clean aesthetic.  It's not a big restaurant at all but it can accommodate a table of 8 easily.  When we arrived on a Monday lunch, the restaurant was already 60% full and it was easily 80% full when we left.  I can see why it is so busy as it does offer flavourful food nicely presented and reasonably priced.    We mainly ordered from the lunch special menu which has a soup, rice, and medium serving of a curry or rice/pad thai with choice of protein or even pho!  The prices ranged from $9 to $11.  Our table ordered the spectrum and everyone left quite happy.  The pho noodle soup was filled with lots of beef slices that were more meat than chewy tendon. I was told the noodles weren't overdone or mushy and the soup base had great flavour.  The pad thai was a bit of the sweeter side but not overbearing... I believe they used palm sugar to get that sweetness.  The person who ordered it said they liked it and reminded them of ones they got in Malaysia.  The curry dishes came with large cuts of chicken breast and the right amount of heat.  It included eggplant in the yellow curry and that was a pleasant addition.  I ordered the shrimp salad with a side of vegetables.  I really liked the bold flavours of the fresh chilli, red peppers, green onions, palm sugar, and ginger.  It complimented the shrimp well.  I also got 5 medium large shrimp in it and they weren't mushy but well cooked to get that nice chew.   The side of vegetables had 3 deep fried pieces of tofu in addition to a fresh selection of Asian vegetables (bok choy, snow peas, carrots, and broccoli).    The meal came within 10 minutes of ordering and this was done with the restaurant being 80% capacity.  The service wasn't 5 star but considering they only had 2 people manning the entire front, it was really quite, polite, and efficient.  You really can't ask for more.  Overall, I definitely recommend the dishes I ate and it sounds like all my coworkers were very happy with theirs as well.  I may want to come here for a dinner and try other seafood options."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to have Thai food. The guys that work here are funny and friendly. It's adds to the experience when we come here.   The resturant always clean and tidy. I usually order a peanut curry white rice and a chicken pad thai. I'm always happy with it! The portions are a good size and there isnt a ling wait for the food.   They also offer cheap lunch specials where you can get a selection of items and it comes with a spring roll. We alwats like to come here on a friday or Saturday night for dinner."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night around 7 pm with a large party (20+) with reservations. The restaurant seems like it can accommodate around 75 patrons at max capacity.  But this restaurant is not equipped to handle this many people.    You'd think restaurant owners would know or care that weekends are their most important nights of the week for business but sadly this place falls very short in that category.  Upon taking our seats, our waiter/waitress was no where to be seen for another 20 minutes.  20 minutes to hand out menus and take basic drink orders seems a bit unreasonable during your important dinner service.  Take note restaurant owner.  Our group of 20 was split up in two tables.  We got their ginormous menus but our table of 10 only got 5 menus and were expected to share which I guess is fine if you're running a third tier mom and pop shop but if you want your customers to have a complete dining experience and charge the prices you charge, it's these little details that need more attention paid towards.  Let's get to the food now.  I ordered a beef green curry which came with a bowl of rice.  The taste, texture and consistency of the liquid was comparable to other Thai curries I've had but sadly the gravest tragedy of this meal was serving food just lukewarm and not piping hot.    This is most likely attributed to the fact the restaurant is understaffed when near capacity and part of me wonders how long my food was sitting on deck waiting to be picked up and brought to me.  Anyhow, not the worse experience I've and but certainly far from the best.  Hopefully they will address the staffing issue because it is kind of a shame to be understaffed on weekends.  I'd really like to see this restaurant succeed so prove me wrong!"}
{"text":"I gave you a 4 star in September '14 and sadly within 6 months, you've gone to a new low of 1 star. What happened to the food and service? Such a shame! I used to love this place and would stop by whenever I could because I loved your food, service and ambiance. The last two visits has been such a disaster - I am left with no choice but to change my review. On both occasions, the food tasted like it was a few days old and reheated in the microwave, the chicken was completely inedible and had a strong stench like wet dog food. We used to get complimentary steamed rice with curry dishes and you don't do this anymore ?! (You need to update your menu as it still indicates that you do) !!!  Your service was horrendous, even though the restaurant was not packed for such slack from them - entrees brought out before appetizers and without rice. Were we supposed to drink the curry? No water was served until we asked them which took forever to get, then to refill was like an endless wait until we stood up to signal them to come over and get it done. The spring rolls brought out after entrees were done, had processed canned chicken in them and were disgusting. After putting your customers through such nonsense, have some courtesy to take the apps off the bill since it was an error on your part or at least apologize if you can't afford it and but can somehow afford to lose loyal customers.   Oh and while you have beautiful wonderful Biblical sayings in the restaurant and play worship music there, please behave more Christian like and either offer complimentary tea to everyone dining instead of choosing only a few guests to offer this to or do it on the d-lo at your discretion instead of making other customers look at each other in disbelief at your generosity to only 'certain'  customers."}
{"text":"Checked this place out based on the ravings on IG. My favourite Thai spots are downtown, but needed a place near Mississauga.   Had the Thai coconut soup as a starter, this was not spicy at all and a little sour for my liking. The main, Thai smoked shrimp past fried rice and the lemongrass lamb which the waiter said was a really good pairing...however I didn't think so. The fried rice was good but nothing amazing (again not spicy) and I wasn't a fan of the lamb at all. I ended up eating the rice alone because I was hungry not cause I was wowed...  I probably would give this place another shot since location is convenient, but would try something more basic like a curry or pad Thai."}
{"text":"Excellent  places to eat. Everyone is really friendly and the food is fresh and delicious. Love  the  general  tso chicken with rice."}
{"text":"I go to great lengths to come to this restaurant, and it is worth every minute and every dime. The warm welcome that draws me into the restaurant is paralleled only by the exquisite flavors found in their Tom Yum Soup and Seafood Noodles.   Don't be surprised by the heavy door. It is conveniently made so to allow you to work out your upper body before dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered peanut curry after reading suggestions from other yelpers. Honestly was expecting it to taste a little better. Don't get me wrong, it's good but not great. I like the way tofu is deep fried, the curry sauce is good too but adding raw veggies like cauliflower,  broccoli,  carrots, etc kinda ruins the overall appeal of the curry. Perhaps they could sautee or stirfry them instead."}
{"text":"Twin Fish is one of my favourite restaurants in Mississauga. Now, I finally get to review them since I just went there yesterday!!! I've gone there probably over eight times, mostly for lunch, and I was never truly disappointed!!! I also love the interior design with abstract art on the two main walls.   Happy:  They have lunch specials from $9-13, whether you want curry with coconut rice, noodle/rice dishes or beef soup noodle (viet). The best part is that some of the dishes come with their mango salad and it's delicious and fragrant. It's a generous portion that you can eat as an appetizer or dessert. They are never short of waiters which is nice to see. The food comes hot and nicely displayed. This time, I had their eggplant + basil dish which had the right spice with steamed rice. My friend had the pad thai with chicken and he always orders that one. Must be that good!!   Not happy:  Sometimes, depending on what you order, it can be salty. Well, that's my opinion since I like it consistent. If you don't go at the right time at lunch time, it can get very busy and once, I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Keep it mind, it's close on Sundays.   Verdict:  Duh?? I would always go back when I have a free lunch hour and dinner - to treat myself!! You won't be disappointed. And since you are there, you might want to catch a movie at Cineplex.  Today (March 2017) - Since it appears I'm a regular now, the friendly server offered me a small plate of mango salad to go with my noodle soup. It was complimentary and thoughtful. I wanted to know how much was the add on, and he said he'll take care of it. Love it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A group of us was in town for business and we booked a table here.  They seemed lost about my reservation, but quickly accommodated us anyway.  They started us with the Twin Fish mixed appetizers, which were all tasty.  I especially liked the Thai spiced calamari and the mango spring roll.  The dipping sauces were all sweet, so they brought me some smoky Thai chili paste to use.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Tangy and tart.  Good flavor.  Now, the reason for 4 stars:  I asked for my green curry with beef to be made spicy.  They did it!  The waiter said if it was not hot enough he didn't know what to do, and that if I ate it, he would shake my hand.  I just love it when I ask for something to be made spicy in a Thai restaurant and they don't wring their hands and worry if it's too hot.  Bring it!  They did just that.  The dish was flavorful and not just pure heat.  The green curry sauce tasted very good.  Plenty of good ingredients, good beef.  And spiked with minced fresh red Thai chili.  Nice job in the kitchen!  The waiter did shake my hand, as did a couple others who emerged from the kitchen.  To me, it was not amazing feat to finish it, but I suppose they do not get a lot of requests like mine.  That makes it even more admirable that they did precisely what I asked."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is Mississauga and there isn't much variety in terms of Thai cuisine. The food itself is decent, some dishes better than others. Came here Friday evening for dinner, had the chicken satay (deep fried, not grilled), lamb curry (not enough sauce, but a lot of lamb shank, massaman curry tasted a bit off), golden curry chicken (very good, not too spicy and had some interesting veggies in it like bamboo), and street style pad thai with beef (quite flavourful, though the portion size was a bit small). So the food overall is pretty good, a few standouts and a few just \"ok\" dishes. The service though, is quite poor. Our server never came back to check on us after our food came, and I had to ask two different servers to get a water refill. Overall, it was an ok experience, nothing too spectacular but nothing too bad, either."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The red snapper with basil sauce.   I liked the flavor of this dish but it can be quite salty so you'll have to order a rice bowl to go with it. The dish unfortunately does not come with rice on the side. You have to order it separately. The fish itself is fried and topped with sauce, peppers, basil leaves, and mushrooms. The red snappers texture was soft and not dry. However in comparison to other Thai restaurants I've been, the flavor can be better. More spices and use of the basil leaves to heighten the aroma of the dish would be awesome.   We also had the twin fish spring roll platter and the pad Thai. The pad Thai was good and the portion size was great. The lamb curry we ordered tasted great but I'd like the curry to use more spices. I thought it can be even better.   LAST TIP?!  They also offer pho here so don't be fooled that it's a Thai restaurant and doesn't offer that option as well. If you celebrate your birthday here, they also will change the song to a birthday song and sing the birthday song with you and your loved ones. They bring out a piece of cake with a candle. Remember, if you order the red snapper entree, it doesn't come with a rice. You have to order separately! Only the curry dishes come with a complimentary side of rice!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to lunch spot every time I'm in town for work, and it has consistently delivered!   Despite it being almost always full, the service is relatively quick.  The food is packed with flavors, which is precisely how Thai food should be!  What I love the most about this place is that they are not shy about using spices.  Their noodles don't clump together and every bite is flavorful."}
{"text":"Great beef satay with flavourful home made dressing on the veggies. Explode in your mouth type flavours.  Wonderful hot and sour soup, again not too spicy but filling and fresh tasting. The service was attentive at the end of a busy rush.  This is one of the best Thai places I've found in a while. Portions were just right and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I've visited Twin Fish a handful of times now and what stood out every single time, was the incredible service. From the minute you walk in, you can tell the employees people and what they do (which is apparently rare nowadays). Beyond the service, they have a wide variety of Thai dishes. The food is fresh and full of flavour. I recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for a last minute dinner. We arrived from vacation not wanting to cook and we were feeling for thai. I did a quick search online for something in the area and this restaurant came up and they did not disappoint.  Food was great. It came out hot and tasted very fresh. We were happy with all the dishes we ordered. We recommend you try them - the basil king fish, the coconut shrimp, the thai green curry, and the mixed veg rice. The only 2 items we didn't love and would not order them again - the garlic chicken and the pumpkin curry soup.  The restaurant itself is cute and cozy. The service is ok but they do try. We ordered a bottle of wine and they didn't order it at the table - we didn't particularly like that.   All in all, we would return."}
{"text":"Very disappointing and misleading! None of the vegetarian dishes are actually vegetarian! All of them contain fish sauce. Having been to so many Thai restaurants, I have to say this is the worse experience so far. I can understand if you cannot substitute the fish sauce with something else because it alters the flavour, but calling them vegetarian dishes while they are clearly not is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"OMG can't believe I have have such a good Thai god in Mississauga !! So authentic!"}
{"text":"Small clean fresh decor.  Limited seating avail for groups. Pleasant, friendly young staff on sat late lunch at 2pm.  Washrooms are clean n small.   Good portioning, food plating and taste.  Mango salad fresh.   Thai sampler platter came with fresh roll, crispy calamari, tender satay chicken, satay beef and shrimp chips.   Green beef curry very delicious.  Hints of lemongrass and mint.  Tried a variety of their different fried noodles with chicken. A big hit.   You must have the golden fried banana with honey n  Mango with sticky rice.   Manager walks around. Talks with customers.  Great job twin fish"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai with tofu had only 2 small pieces of tofu in it.   The portion size was small.   I have no idea how this restaurant has such high reviews. I cannot in good conscience give it more than 2 stars. The people were nice. The food was not great. It was really greasy."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of people by a recommendation of a friend. We found out that the owners were Christian and really liked the fact that there was Christian music and also a Bible verse printed on each receipt. I tried the Street style Pad Thai and my husband got the Golden Curry Chicken with Rice. The portions are huge, and the food is really really good. Very authentic Thai spices were used, and the fragrance of my husband's curry was really good. My pad thai had lots of ingredients and was not made of ketchup (the usual pad thai style). We also tried the Thai milk tea, but I didn't like that as much. The colour was more of an orange colour, and it was a bit overly sweet. However, all in the all, the seating was comfortable, ambience was nice, food was great and the service was wonderful."}
