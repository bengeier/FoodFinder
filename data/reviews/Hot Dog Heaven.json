{"text":"Definitely reminds me of the greasy hot dog/Italian beef places in Chicago. The food is awesome and if you are from Chicago you will feel at home here. If it was just a food review I've give 5 stars hands down. However, they don't take credit cards and considering the price of the food I don't understand why. I usually wind up spending almost $10, it's a hot dog stand for crying out loud! I also get this weird feeling from the the goons behind the counter. I'm obviously not one of the regulars and I feel like they're of sizing me up, yeah right, like I'm going to crawl through the window and start kicking some hot dog guy's ass. Whatev, the dogs are awesome, enjoy!"}
{"text":"The hot dog was less then ordinary. We were ignored while the server had a long chat with a friend."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Ordering can be a little awkward sometimes, but the food is worth it. Love the polish sausage with sport peppers and grilled onions. The fries are crisp and tasty too."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to hot dog heaven. Simply hot dogs, italian beef sandwiches, and fries.  I ordered the italian beef and got a chili cheese dog for my lady and cheese fries to share.  This was my first time trying italian beef and it was not good.  The meat was dry with hardly any flavor and the bun was soggy from the au jus.  I ate half immediately and the other half thirty minutes later and was nauseous shortly after that.  The hot dog and fries were typical and a satisfactory quick lunch.  The fries were thick like steak fries.  There were two guys at the hot dog heaven stand and the service was quick but I changed my mind a few times during ordering and had to get money from the ATM (cash only place) so the guy was visibly annoyed and in a rush although I was the only customer in line to order.  Hot Dog Heaven, attitude and hot dogs."}
{"text":"Took the family there for a memorial day treat. Glad we went, but won't go back. Everyone commented the food was OK, but not worth the $$$ ($23 for 3 hotdogs, 1 italian, 1 fries and 1 drink.). $2 for non refill soda, $0.50 for a cup of water? My son had the Italian sandwich which was fantastic. Everyone else had some form of hotdog which were tasteless - despite all the goodies thrown on. Wife said Sam's Club hotdogs were more flavorful. Fun experience that's about it."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Stop by this place for sure:) they have great hotdogs and chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"Let's begin with the good. GREAT hotdogs. Love the Chicago style. The chili cheese is also pretty awesome. But other than the awesome food, there are a few negatives that honestly don't really matter much which is why I am only taking back one star. They don't package the hot dogs well if you are placing a large order so be sure to request to have them separated and not all shoved into one bag which will smash all the hot dogs at the bottom :-/ Location, location, location! Horrible. Worst accessibility ever. No parking available, you must pull up to the curb around the corner. On the brink of a ghetto neighborhood. Also, this is a family owned business, and the guys who run it are sort of ... welp, rude haha. Very loud and sort of bluntly raw. Like you are really IN Chicago. Other than that, the food is really cheap and great tasting so I guess that's really what the review boils down to."}
{"text":"We LOVE Hot Dog Heaven.  Don't forget to take cash, no debit or cc accepted, but so worth the trip.  I'm gonna go the there now!"}
{"text":"I love Hot Dog Heaven! It looks like a small little Mom n' Pops storefront restaurant which was what attracted me. Everything was neat and clean and organized.  The workers making your food and taking your order are very nice and move efficiently and fast. I tried a piece of my co-workers' burger, and it was easily comparable to a Whopper from Burger King. Sooooooooo good! I was more in a sweet tooth type of mood, so I bought the funnel cake fries covered in yummy powdered sugar, as well as the Turtle Sundae. They made me feel so good inside.  Lol. Everything was fresh and delicious. I can't wait to go back and try the actual food."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are ok.  Service is terrible.  The cashier got upset because my wife asked for mayonnaise and was rude to her when she asked questions.  Honestly the hotdogs at Costco are better and you don't get attitude."}
{"text":"parking is a challenge, watch out for that dip. i got a chili cheese dog with onions and a large fry, pretty pricey for what you get imho. Felt like chicago as soon as you order from the menu, pretty straight forward. the food was good im a big guy i shouldlve ordered another dog but i just wanted to try the place out"}
{"text":"A staple of the area, hot dogs with chili sauce and cheese are amazing.  Quaint atmosphere like someone's living room.  Great dessert selections as well."}
{"text":"I don't know of the guy was having a bad day, but today the bald guy with glasses didn't like that I gave him a $20 and he tossed my change down at me and it flew all over.  I asked him if I did something wrong by giving him a $20, like 3 more people after me did also, and he says \"No, that's the just the way I am, have a nice day!\" And he turns around to ignore me.

I don't care how good the food is there, I'll never spend another dime at that stand. He was shaking his head at me in disgust because I didn't have anything smaller than a $20.  They had an AM installed outside too. Guess what denomination it gives out?? Cash only businesses should know they have to MAKE CHANGE.  
It's not my fault you weren't prepared.  Customer lost.  

And the Fire Dog was way overcooked."}
{"text":"He's like the soup nazi on Seinfeld he's rude to the customers but they keep coming back for the food, I get the italian beef with mozzarella, he charges 50 cents for refills it cost 3 pennies cheapskate only on the strip you can get away with charging drink refills"}
{"text":"I have been going to Hot Dog Heaven since I was a girl in high school. I love this place. It was a great little spot to stop on the way home from school since the high school was just down the street, and I had to walk past it with my friends every school day anyway. It has a small town homey feel to it, and I believe that it has always had the same owner. I may be a bit nostalgic about the place, but there is a reason for that. The owner has always greeted customers with a nice smile, and the kitchen workers move fast and get your food out to you quickly. They have different options for the sizes of meals you are looking for, like a partner pack, family pack, etc., and the prices can't really be beat. The only downfall to this place is that it is a bit on the small side, but they do offer a small dining area outside in front. The chairs inside are not the most comfortable (I think that they may even be the same ones I sat on when I was 14 years old, such a long time ago)! The parking lot is a bit small and I've seen people struggle to get in and out of it when it is really busy. It is a great little hot dog place though, and they have fresh cut fries! I would definitely recommend it! Just make sure there is a table available before you unload everyone if you want to sit inside and have a large group."}
{"text":"Everyone's mentioning the surly man taking your order so yeah, don't expect a teenager hopped up caffeine to take your money but the food is good and freshly made. Vienna dog, fries, and a coke cost me around $7.50 and I licked my fingers after. Go there and take cash with you."}
{"text":"HDH has built up quite a reputation and I've been hearing about this place from my brother since last summer. Today I finally had the pleasure of trying their dogs and thought they were just okay. The dog was pretty good but the cheese topping the chili was the premelted sort you would find better paired with nachos.

That said, we had a great time at HDH and I would go again next time I'm in town. Its pretty good for the area."}
{"text":"This is the same place as the hole in the wall on Lake Mead Parkway which is a bit of a Vegas tradition.

The owner Joe, is from Chicago and and has that 'down to earth' attitude that they are famous for.  If your a little insecure or a pretentious type, the personality can be a little in your face (but hell why you getting hot dogs then?) - For me that is what made the first location so great - you try to be a wiseguy and you get schooled in how to do it.  

The location is just next to Starbucks and across the road from 24 Hour Fitness on Maryland.  Very nice and clean inside, with plenty of tables and chairs.  I asked what was the protein content of the dogs since I was after a meal after a workout and was told \"hey Chicago dogs are all meat, the best you can get' and called a name I am sure in the Chicago tradition was a term of endearment.

Very reasonable prices and the food tastes great, but for me as a visitor from overseas the best part is the attitude which is right out of a mob movie.  Some might find this a little too much but a place that has good food, at good prices AND a personality is worth the trip across town to expereince"}
{"text":"Great food, been eating there for 12 years now. But the order taking is a ZERO on a scale of 1 to 10, so you better check and re-recheck your order before you leave if you get the food for take out."}
{"text":"Best Polish in the valley!  Favorite place for French Fries too.  Gets busy during lunch break but any other time the wait is pretty short."}
{"text":"I  can honestly say I don't understand how so many reviews are this positive. I lived in Chicago all of my life; but I have been out here for a year.  Their food is very mediocre at best. If it were a hot dog stand in Chicago I definitely would not make a trip back. But since there are not many options we have been going there since we moved here. The beefs are pretty average but will pass if you have a taste for one. The worst part of their Italian beef would be the bread. Although I cannot fault him for that,  I have heard you cannot buy decent bread here in Las Vegas. Definitely no Turano. Their hot dogs are usually luke warm. 
But truly the icing on the cake is what a jackass this guy is. I mean he is truly relentless. Our last trip here a few weeks ago we ordered two beefs and four hot dogs. He almost refused to make them because he scolded my husband for not calling such a \"large order\"(large order!?) in ahead of time. Mind you it was 2 o'clock in the afternoon and we were seriously the only people there! In the past I kept laughing it off but he's just such an ass I Won't go back. I get how people on here might think that's a schtick-but I've been to wiener Circle many many times in Chicago that's their schtick; this guy is just a jerk."}
{"text":"I think it was good the food the fish sandwich was amazing the only thing wrong with the place is the prices are high on somethings but overall i would like to comeback and try the funnel cake fries"}
{"text":"The Food here is killer the Beef sandwiches, the Hot Dogs, the French Fries. Its very East Coast/Chicago etc and the guys that own it are from there too so dont be offended my lil California friends, these guys are there to make/sell food and they do it good! Sometimes if theres a big wait or whatever they even gave my Wife a free soda."}
{"text":"Fries were crispy and thin - delicious!  I used a bit of seasoned salt on them (on all tables - nice touch!). Lots of variety for hot dog toppings but all appropriate and not too  terribly messy.  Chili on the chili dog had a fresh tomato-y taste. The BLT dog was unique and tasty with small, lean bits of real bacon, just enough lettuce pieces to make it crisp, fresh tomato pieces, and just a bit of mayo to hold it all together. Delicious and satisfying!"}
{"text":"The food is great, especially the italian beef. It is the characters behind the counter that make the experience complete. If you are overly sensitive and are wound around the axle with customer service, you are going to have a bad time. 

Too bad this location is closed. They still have the hut over on Lake Near though."}
{"text":"The food is great, especially the italian beef. It is the characters behind the counter that make the experience complete. If you are overly sensitive and are wound around the axle with customer service, you are going to have a bad time. 

A few things to keep in mind when going to eat here.
1. Know what you want before you get to the window. If you waste their time asking if they have hot dogs, you will be insulted.

2. None of what they say should you take personally. Most of the time if they make some offhand remark it is to either get a rise out you or they are gauging to see if you can verbally play.

3. You are eating at a roadside shack, not the four seasons.

This place has been around for more than 10 years for a reason."}
{"text":"The best Chicago food this side of the Mississippi... Everyone claims to have Chicago this or that but I'm from Chicago n no one in this town comes even close... This place is like I'm eating back home!!"}
{"text":"Old School Hot Dog Stand. The staff was very helpful when ordering. The sausage dog was really good. Fries were great. A pleasant experience all around."}
{"text":"Best Italian Beef in or out of Chicago!  I come from 13 miles away just for the beef sandwiches.  Exactly what I remember from Chicago, including the gardinere which no one else has."}
{"text":"I was recently doing some work by this restaurant and had permission from the owner to use part of their parking lot for about 2 hours,  mind you this is 2 and a half hour before the restaurant opened.  The owner kept coming out being rude and nasty with us and hassled is about his $200 parking spot, he was complaining about us preventing him from making money but yet he wasn't even open yet.  We were out of there 15 minutes after he opened.  I haven't met someone that rude in a long time.  we had thought about coming back to try his famous hotdogs, but certainly not now."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried it for the 1st and last time. The owner is abrasive and cheap. We ordered a Chili dog w/no onions and a polish dog that came with mustard and grilled onions. I asked for the grilled onions to be on the side. He said \"I'll have to charge you for that\". My reply was why, onions come with it? He said I have to charge for the cup. Normally charge .97 I'll only charge you  .25. Really??? How stupid. I laughed at him        My husband informed me the side cups are .02 cents a piece. So we waited patiently for our food. When we open our hot dogs. It was obvious they were not quality hot dogs. Very average. My husband is in the business and told me 7 11 sells better quality hot dogs. Save your time and money"}
{"text":"The service is a bit surly but if you grew up in chicago like I did, it's pretty normal...we are slammed, let's get to it....type of service. Do you want your food quickly and correctly or lip service? I vote for the food. Best Chicago style Italian beef and cheese fries in Vegas. If you aren't a sensitive liberal whimp, you'll love the food and experience."}
{"text":"I was one of their first customers in 1978/79 and just flew up from South Carolina and Hot Dog Heaven is a MUST HAVE. I'll be there tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but lack of customer service sucks. The women are rude and act like they don't even want to be at work. I go there maybe once a month and I dread even talking to them because they piss me off every time. I wish I knew the names of the people, but the one with the ponytail and hat is disgusting rude."}
{"text":"Excellent Dogs and Beefs. That's all that matters. To those crying about the \"rudeness\", grow a couple and come back when you're older."}
{"text":"Hot Dog Heaven has been a landmark restaurant in Amherst Ohio, since 1976. Jack O'Flanagan , former educator turned entrepreneur still works the grill every day. The food is just delicious. From the hotdogs, hamburgers, fish, and kielbasa to their famous French fries you can't go wrong with this dining choice. The French fries remind you if how they used to cook them a Cedar Point in the 1970's in peanut oil.
Their hot fresh family fries can feed a family! You get your money's worth eating here.
You can sign up for coupons to be emailed to you and they accept them by the just showing the emailed coupons on your smartphone."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've worked across the street for years and have never tried this place. Plus, after reading lots of reviews about the customer service here, I was a bit nervous and wanted to make sure I got my order down before I got there. 

To my surprise, the gentleman behind the counter was extremely friendly. He noticed that I had run across the street from the hospital I was working at and told me that I could place a phone order next time. Then I wouldn't have to wait in the hot sun. He also gave me menus to take back to work with me and said if they aren't busy they just might be able to run it over to me in the pharmacy. I mean, how sweet is that?

I ordered the Maxwell Street Style Polish Sausage which came with perfectly carmelized onions. Also ordered the Vienna All Beef Hotdog with everything on it. This hot dog was done Chicago Style and that's my favorite way to eat a hot dog. Especially with that bright green relish!"}
{"text":"Tried today for the first time,been meaning to for a long time.
I'll get straight to it! I tried the chili cheese dogs and they were just ok.
I actually liked the dogs,had good flavor and a bit of snap! The chili was similar to Weinerschnitzel which I like. The bun was ok.
Overall,a decent dog.  Not Heaven but not Hell either!"}
{"text":"The old guy who took my order was very rude, and if he's the owner, he shouldn't be in business. He didn't even greet me and just stood there and stared at me. I didn't feel good about this but still ordered a dog. However, when he went to prepare the food with his bare hands without even washing them and after he touched the counter and other things, I changed my mind and said never mind and left."}
{"text":"I am a Chicago native and I believe this place rivals most hotdog joints in Chicago.

My boyfriend and I got a hotdog wish Chicago fixings and an Italian beef with sweet and hot peppers. Both were perfect representations of home. The dog had the doughy, super soft poppy seed bun with the perfect balance of dog and toppings. They do traditional Vienna beef dogs  - no Red Hots here. The Italian beef was sliced super thin with a very beefy aus jus that reminds me of Johnny's in Chicago. The bun was super soft and fell apart while eating: a great sign of a true Chicago Italian beef. 

It is cash only here, but they have an ATM outside next to the window. Service is quick and the guys who run the place are so nice. Please come here to get a true taste of Chicago and a great dog for a good price."}
{"text":"The salad style dogs always impress with so much flavor and I'm always happy to visit hot do heaven with their friendly workers and building with so much character!"}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch there it was inexpensive and pretty good. Chili sauce was a little sweeter than I expected but can't go wrong with the price. Handcut fries were very tasty! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Italian Beef sandwich in the middle of the Vegas desert...don't get the hot dog..it's fine, but not the Italian Beef.  This place has the complete experience...a grumpy cashier who manages his screen-window like a guillotine...pulling it up just long enough to take your cash and drop your food on the counter.  He once settled an argument my brother and I were having about \"what's in your pickle relish\" with a one word answer...\"pickles\"....and if you've ever been there, you'll be familiar with this little welcome: \"NEXT!!\""}
{"text":"Good, simple, straight forward food. The hotdogs are normal size (like you'd make at home), so some people may want to order two. They only except cash, so be prepared, although there is an ATM on site. The maxwell street style polish sausage was awesome!"}
{"text":"Another guilty pleasure from my Oberlin days.  I would load up the car with weed-addled out of state dormies and take them out of Oberlin and into the deep Old Country for a real hot dog.  You have never seen flaky lefty college kids devour hot dogs this fast, and you have never seen locals stare so hard."}
{"text":"Ok, the guy was gruff, but not mean. Growing up in Chicago I know italian beef and the one I had today was it! Cash is king, no cards accepted.  I believe I will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"The hotdogs are okay, pricing isn't bad, but the guy that was serving me was a douche! I've been to places where the food was good enough to overlook the service... this isn't one of them!"}
{"text":"A must come to whenever I come home to visit!!!! There's something about these dogs that I gotta have!! And let's not forget about the fries with cheese!!!!"}
{"text":"Real deal holyfield! 
Never fails when I come here, I get the same good ol' meal just as the last visit. I had the italian beef and a side of fries this time. Sitting here typing my thumbs away stuffed as all heck, thinking man that was good for 9 bucks. Thank you hot dog heaven!"}
{"text":"Best hotdog in town. Friendly service and quick. I recommend you stop by and give this hot dog palace a try. That is if you're in Vegas"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and beat the rush. A long lone formed behind us soon after ordering. There is not designated parking so you will need to park along the street. The owner took out order and he was nice but also interesting lol. He seemed to take pride in what he does and also has a funny sense of humor. So I ordered the maxwell street polish dog. It wasn't bad but not worth over $5. Had I known it would be dipped I would have asked them not to because it just made it a soggy mess. it looked fine until I picked it up and it all fell apart. The bread doesn't hold up well after being dipped like other places I have been to. I would eat it again if it were cheaper in price. I shared an order of chili cheese fries with my wife and they were just ok. It was a big portion so ordering the chili cheese fries alone for the first time could be shocking. The chili had okay flavor but no spice and because it is Chicago chili there were no beans naturally. There is no drive thru you have to walk up and place your order at the window and they only take cash for payment. There are seats and tables near the order window."}
{"text":"Claims to be original Chicago style food. There claims are spot-on! Sometimes I get the hotdogs and other times I order the Italian roast beef w/sweet peppers. Original Chicago feel all the way down to the owners accent! I stop there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Limited menu of Vienna dogs, a few sandwiches, and fries out of a shack on the side of the road. Heads up that they're cash only and don't have covered seating available. Dog was okay, made to order yet somehow still barely warm for just over $3. Not sure I'd come back if I were in the area, definitely wouldn't come out of my way."}
{"text":"We went to hot dog heaven and escaped hell

POOR SERVICE
CHEAP INGREDIENTS 

Continuously having attitude to customers, he must hate his life.

He even offended the customer in line behind us saying \"Everything we have is right there!\" After she ordered she came over and said \"god that guy was so rude, oh I better not say anything this is the type of place that will poison you\"

Thing after thing proved a RUDE CLERK.

 DO NOT VISIT"}
{"text":"nothing special just a cony dog shack but the staff is kind and they have your order fast"}
{"text":"Hot dog Heaven is a great place to go. You can Eat delicious food on the run or you could sit down. I like that hot dog Heaven is a warm place in both heat and welcoming. Just eating their hotdogs is delicious, they easily have the best hotdogs in town!! It's also a nice place to go because you see the employees every time you go, it's like you see the same exact people that work there  so they know what you like to eat. For my opinion there are really no bad things about hotdog heaven. I hope you go see hotdog heaven in Amherst"}
{"text":"I'm a glutton for Chicago food!  Real maxwell St. Polish Sausage, Vienna Dogs, & a real Chicago Italian Beef!  You get the authentic food with the accent!  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"everything about this place is awesome,  from the little dodgy shack its housed in, to the surly guys running the joints,  its just like chicago.
the pirces are just right, the food is exactly, if not better to what you get in chicago. the italian beef with gardinere is sooooo good and the dogs are awesome, nice steamy bun, fresh toppings and its not tiny liek other places. the polish sausage is great tooo.

if you are looking for a true midwest flavor, this is it!"}
{"text":"The three rating comes from the French Fries. They were excellent--skins on, thin cut, crispy, hot. We also had Mac and cheese, a special, that was fine-- velveetaish cheese on shells.  The plain hot dog and mini corn dogs were nothing special. Maybe the beef dog would be better. Service was fine, but woman at counter seemed impatient with my kids reading the menu.  Bathroom was clean. Slushies are a choice for value meals, my son found that out and was pleased.

Really had higher hopes, a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great. From the Italian beef sandwich to the dogs. You cant go wrong. The wieners are so good that you will be taking two on at a time by double fistting them. Make sure you bring cash though."}
{"text":"I had the beef sandwich, it was HUGE!!!! very good, but too big for me!  The cheese fries were good as well.  They do take a rather long time to make the food, so they do let you call in ahead of time so you dont have to wait so long... OUT SIDE!"}
{"text":"So yum! The Maxwell Street Style Polish Dog was oh so good... And the cheese fries were crispy and perfectly covered in hot cheese sauce. Just moved to the neighborhood and we will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Childhood favorite. Love this place. Unique cheese sauce with perfectly cooked hot dogs and super soft buns. Hand cut French fries and desserts I never have room for once I finish my meal. Always a mist visit when I'm back in town or passing thru"}
{"text":"Best hot dog in greater Las Vegas.
The Italian Beef sandwich is really great.
My favorite place to get a real Chicago dog. They use all Vienna Beef products."}
{"text":"This is how it should be. No frills, no gimmicks and an affordable lunch for the working man. 

If you are worried about parking or cute names for the hot dogs this isn't the place for you. 

Park like a boss and get yourself a Maxwell street and some fries. Take 5 and enjoy the tasty dog then get back to work! Slacker!"}
{"text":"Went to this hole in the wall today-The moron clerk fucked up my order by making sandwiches instead of hotdogs and then but pickled peppers on 1 Beef Sandwich and grilled green peppers on the other-I took sandwiches to go got home and this pissed me off.
Sandwich with pickled peppers made me sick reported this place to Health Dept located only 10 minutes away-Never going back wasn't my money."}
{"text":"I was so excited (and waited ever so impatiently) for this location to open as I love the Lake Mead Pkwy one. But alas, it's just not the same.

Sure, the food is technically the same - it's one of the best Chicago dogs in Vegas. But this immaculate strip mall location lacks the charm of the little Lake Mead Pkwy hut.

There's just something about ordering your hot dog at a walk-up window and eating it outside that adds to the flavor and overall experience.

The staff at this location, though, are just a nice as the Lake Mead one. They've truly gone above and beyond each time I've eaten here."}
{"text":"All hail the Chicago dog.  Loaded with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, neon-green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices, pickled sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt, it is the Lord of the kingdom of hot dogs.  It's seriously the pinnacle of hot dog cuisine.  Every time I make it to Chicago, I go out of my way to hit a legendary hot dog stand and order one.

But we're a long way from the Windy City here in the desert, and I believed the Chicago dog just simply didn't exist in this environment (legend has it that free-range neon-green relish needs to roam frozen streets with -20 below windchill to maintain its florescent hue).  

But Vegas seems to be catching on to the forgotten childhood joy that is the hot dog.  And the Chicago-natives that run Hot Dog Heaven are offering up a perfect Chicago dog out in Hender-tucky (on Lake Mead Road in old Henderson).  Chicago dog not your style?  They do a solid job with chili and cheese on a hot dog as well (or fries for that matter).  

Basically, Hot Dog Heaven is a really good hot dog stand.  How good?  Well, I love the hot dogs here so much that I'm willing to deal with the gruff . . . rather dickish customer service.  Yeah, they're not newcomer friendly and tend to rush people ordering.  So if you go, know what you want to order before you get to the Order Window or they can be real jerks. 

That warning aside, this is the place to go in the valley if you have a classic hot dog craving.  I give them 5 stars for the quality of their hot dogs, minus one star for their customer service failings."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chicago dog in the Vegas area. And it's got all the charm you expect from a hot dog place.

This is a little roadside hut where you order at the window and eat on outside tables. The staff are awesome and very reminiscent of the attitude and friendliness you get at such a place in Chicago.

The Chicago dog is just as it should be - Vienna Beef with all of the classic toppings. Quick and delicious.

The chili dog is pretty darn good too. Though, personally, I always opt for experiencing the chili via the fries."}
{"text":"Great Italian beef sandwich. But that's where the good ends. Hot dogs are way over priced and the owner is an opinionated jackass. He's lucky he has that window between us. The ridiculous prices certainly aren't justified by the ambience or overhead. Used to love this place but not anymore. Over 10 bucks for two hot dogs and a Coke with stale buns. I do not recommend this place and I certainly won't be returning.

May 1st,2017. Looks like the owners crappy attitude could have led to their demise. Rode by there today,the sign is gone,equipment gone and ATM gone. Looks like Hot Dog Heaven has gone to Hot Dog Heaven."}
{"text":"Hot dog heaven is serving up some of my hometown staples, including Chicago hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches and polish sausages. If only it wasn't so far from me, I would probably be here often. Yes, the guy taking your order is not friendly, but I think that makes the place feel more authentic. Yeah I said it :) 

Anyway I ordered a cheese dog and opted to split the chili cheese fries with my friend. The cheese dog was good, I am a sucker for liquid cheese. They use Nathan's hot dogs so you already know that was tasty. The bun was warm and covered with poppy seeds. The chili cheese fries were massive, definitely more than enough for 2 people to share. I didn't particularly care for the chili, but for those of you who like chili sans beans, you might like this. I am looking forward to trying some of their other items, when I make it out to that side of town"}
{"text":"I went there last night for the first time, found out about this place on one of my iPhone apps. I happened to stay at a Motel 6 nearby since I came from CA so I decided to check it out

This place is like a local pizza joint but instead of serving pizza, they serve hot dogs!! It's not a big place, kind of small, could fit around 20 people on first floor but they do have 2nd floor for more seating. I went there on a slow night so there weren't alot of customers.

I first ordered 2 jumbo dogs, 1 was a BLT and the other one with cheese and bacon bites, I got my orders within 5 mins, nice and fast!! They actually bring ur order to ur table instead of having u wait for it, so that's nice!! Both of my dogs were awesome!! Beautifully presented. 

Then later I ordered a small size of their cheese bacon fries. Their fries were nice and warm and crispy, that's the way I like it!! 

I would definately recommend this place to anyone who likes hot dog. It would be great if they have a TV set inside."}
{"text":"I have never been here before. I loved the simple charm of this place and it's a pure Hot Dog enthusiasts heaven. 

It's the perfect place to take a break and go get a very good Hot Dog. 

I had the Maxwell Polish dog. Absolutely delicious! The only reason this place gets a 3 instead of a 5 for me is the portion size of the dog vs. the price. No way that dog is worth almost $5. The $1 Polish dogs at Costco are twice the size and almost as tasty. 

Bring that price down to at least just under $3 and I would prefer this dog to anything else. Unless you decide to offer slightly better seating and friendlier service. That I don't mind paying extra for."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that I am and Italian American from Chicago, IL and just recently moved to Henderson just a few months ago, and have eaten at just about every Chicago hot dog joint in Illinois like Portillos, Boston's Beef, and Super Dawg,  and not all Chicagoans, or other dog joints have people with attitudes working at them.

Now lets talk about the food. 

Good to see them using Vienna Beef in their dogs, but not having poppy seeds on the buns kills the taste right away. Serving stale buns is something you find at a joint not doing well or getting ready to close.
Sport peppers were fresh, dog had a good snap to it, and over all, it was good to eat some home food, but they could do better. 
We enjoyed the fries as well, but a little salty.

Now lets talk attitude!

Owner behind the counter is bald, has glasses, and very very piss poor attitude that kills the food. First thing, his throws change back at the guy in front of us, which to me would deserve being pulled out from behind the counter and made an example out of. Next, we get up to the window, and no hi how you doing, but, \"What do you want\". My wife was ready to leave right then and there, but I wanted to try the food. Next he is talking about going back to Chicago to his partner or employee, and I chimed in and said nows not a good time cause the weather was crappy, then he says with his smart ass mouth, \"Great another critic to but in\", I mean come on, trying to talk to someone I assume used to live in Illinois.

Last, not getting any napkins or paper towels. I mean come on, Chicago Italian Beef sandwich is not very clean, its supposed to be messy, and your gonna need to clean your hands and face, but not here. might as well have asked him to date his wife or daughters. 

Still trying to like this place and enjoy our first time here, and its not going well obviously, I decide to try a little more small talk to see if he warms up at all. I say to him that Italian Ice would go real good with his food, and here comes the owner of the year award as he yells to worry about my own business.

This guy can pound sand for all I care, there is another place on the other side of town called Windy City Beef that will be getting all of our business for now on, regardless its twice as far to get too.

Stay away and spend your money in a better place. Ive given the joint 2 stars cause the food isnt bad, as long as the ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Five stars for the fries.  If they served nothing but fries I'd still want to go here.  The chili dogs are as good as ever, but I'll skip the cheese goo next time it was bland and felt a little slimy."}
{"text":"i swear, if on curb appeal alone... this place always scared me when i drove passed it... but something had to keep the peeps coming back... so i decided to try it...

so i walk up to the window, 2 big dudes (definitely east coasters too with their accents and attitude) asked what i would be having... i said gimme what everyone here is ordering - hes like ok: Italian Beef with peppers, onions and provolone cheese, a bag of fries, and a soda...

good laaaaawwwwddd... seriously, thats a a beef sammich - 5 star quality, it was awesome... and they arent shittin you either, it was literally a brown sack lunch bag filled with hot fried steak fries... whoa.

it was awesome... so why not 5 stars? well... its on the street, and there is no sit down places, they have 2 outdoor tables but it isnt even worth it to try and sit down, crowded and dirty... cant sit on the curb because its at the intersection of lake mead and boulder, so its a real busy street with alot of dirt kicked up... the hours are what ever the two guys running the joint wants it to be, sometimes they are open late / sometimes they arent open at all - wtf - but thats a serious ITALIAN BEEF sammich, and well worth it if / when you can get it."}
{"text":"Vienna dogs with everything on them - 3 stars - nothing to write home about. In fact too small for their $3 price.  French fries were better than most. - 4 stars. However. The owner's angry berating foul mouth cursing of a person who sat at one of the three tables who had not yet purchased a hot dog really soured the experience. This was done as he yelled past me, over my shoulder while I am at the window to order - priceless. No amount of great food or great former reputation can make up for their inhospitable unbelievably terrible bungling of this situation. Turned out others in the shack new the guy. That guy and my guests and myself will never be back to Hamburger HELL,"}
{"text":"We love going here often. We always get very good service and the food is good every time. I love their hot dogs, hamburgers, and especially their fries. We usually go during their one dollar thing. I recommend that everyone goes here."}
{"text":"Get your Chicago Style hotdog. Joe will take care of ya. His authentic food is flavorful and the messiness of it is finger licking good. Try everything once then again. Every time I get your fries they are perfect! I love your menu Joe!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid, Owner can get a little loud it's apart of the experience wouldn't be hotdog heaven without him. The food is great and they have 
Best Chili dogs in Las Vegas hands down!"}
{"text":"I'd give the food here 5 stars, but the guys are just jerks. I mean, usually I can handle a city attitude. I have like 5 italian uncles. But when I see you be nice and respectful to other customers and rude to me, I am not with that. I use to grub here frequently while working up at Lake Las Vegas. They were never SUPER nice, but I never had a problem. Nor did I really this time. I just noticed the way he was to the 2 old ladies ordering, offering extras and to be put on the mailing list (apparently they are moving) in the mean time he literally tossed my to go bag out the window like I was there to rob him, with not a \"here you go\" or a \"thank you\". 
I want to support this place, but I am just not with bad service. I will be sticking with Chi Town Hustler for my Chicago Dog and Italian Beef!"}
{"text":"If you don't love it you just don't get it. It's just a hot dog stand. Like something you'd get in Chicago."}
{"text":"I love this little stand.  My go to order is a cheese dog and small fries.  I've tried most of the menu and never been disappointed.  Chicago and Fire dogs are legit.  The chili cheese fries are huge.  I've never had any problems with service.  They aren't super nice but never rude like other reviews mentioned.  I usually call in my order and it is always ready when I get there.  Cash only but they do have an atm on site."}
{"text":"Was in the area one morning and i have always wanted to try this place because it just looked like a good old fashioned hot dog stand. When i walked up to the window i could smell the hot dogs and see everything out like they were open.  We saw a man inside reading something, we asked if we could order and he said they dont open for 5 minutes and looks back down. he was rude and ruined my desire for even wanting to go back. if he would of said the food would be ready in a minute or something to that extent i would of waited, but he seemed like he could careless I came to his business. Go to Coney Island right around the corner on water st."}
{"text":"sooooo disappointed in this one. My husband got the hot dog with onion and hot peppers. He said it was not the best he has ever had. I got a chicken sandwich and was asked what kind of cheese I wanted. I asked for cheddar and the girl asked if I wanted it melted....yes. 
I was given a warmed up chicken breast that was rubbery, and instead of real cheese, I was treated to a squirt of canned cheese. I could not eat it after the first bite. The sauerkraut tastes like it came right out of the can so if you are looking for a good kraut for you dog, go downtown Cleveland for a delish dog from the karts outside all the main buildings. There are so many good things that could be done with this restaurant....better quality is first, offer other options like vegan or real grilled chicken breast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service is entertaining, he is rude but its not malicious.  The Italian beef is my go to and my husband jumps around the hot dog menu. Cash only, there are ATMs on every corner so that's no biggie."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick hot dog and a drink this is a stop on the side of the road. $6 for a kraut dog and a bottle of water. It was adequate."}
{"text":"The guy at the window is rude. The Italian Beef for 7.00 lacks the real condiments.  They are cutting corners and your not supposed to say anything. Get yelled at if you call it out.
When you say Sweet peppers and hot peppers.
It's not green bell peppers and jalapeños.  That's not Chicago that's Mexico. Sorry taking my 10.00 else where. And it's because your lacking honesty about the food. 
* sweet and hot peppers  are ball peppers.  
You can't throw on Jalapeños and think someone who has been to Chicago doesn't notice."}
{"text":"The buns were stale and the older man with the glasses that runs the registrar is rude, very rude.
This place is alright they really have no competition in the area. There are way better places on the Westside to get Chicago style hotdogsand Italian beef. Chicago hotdogs and Al Chicago hotdogs on the Westside have a 10 times better Italian beef and way fresher ingredients. What do you have to do to get a fresh Bun. Out of five hotdogs that were ordered for the party I was with all five Chicago hotdogs had stale buns.and as far as the old man owner that works the register he's so freaking angry or he's hates men of color. I don't understand why you're so happy when we're coming to buy hotdog from you you should really not be so rude to people and maybe intern you would be a happier person.because of the owners rudeness and the stale buns I give this place one star"}
{"text":"CLOSED ONE MONTH AFTER OPENING.

I dont know what.happened to this place but.only one month after they opened, there was an eviction notice on the door."}
{"text":"I had a friend talking about a hot dog place in this shopping center.  We live close by and are always in the area.  I told him that the hot dog place closed a while back.  He then kept telling me that there is a different hot dog place.  So the next time I went to the Smith I made it a point to check it out and see what hot dog place was now in this spot.  I noticed the sign Hot Dog Heaven and immediately thought isn't that the name of the other hot place in Henderson that everyone raves about?  

So we finally were in the mood for hot dogs and decided to check this place out.  I was afraid that the hot dogs would be overpriced because the last place before this was a little expensive.  Hence, it not being there anymore?  I walked in the door and was greeted immediately by the guys who were working.  I grabbed a menu as my wife instructed me to just get her what ever I get.  I was surprised to see menu full of items that weren't hot dogs.  This place offer baby back ribs, sandwiches, and even hot wings!  The two guys were very friendly.  I had to ask them if this was the same place at the other one in Henderson.  They said it's the same name and they offer more food items.  I kind of felt embarrassed asking if it was as good as the other one.  I knew the answer I would receive.  

I ordered 2 specials which consisted of a hot dog and fries.  The hot dog is Chicago style of course.  Well equipped with the neon green relish, pickle, peppers, and tomatoes.   I had to order a chili dog too.  Just to see what is was like.  

Overall this dogs were good.  I am not from Chicago so I am not going to judge the hot dog so much. It was tasty and the bun to hot dog ratio was good.  The size of the dogs were healthy.  The chili dog was OK.  I think I just like my chili a certain way.  I wish it was a little spicier.  The french fries were really good too.  

If these dogs were a little more expensive then I would have expected more.  This place is definitely worth trying out.  Especially if you live in this area since the dining options are a little limited.  It's a good alternative to the other fast food joints and won't break your wallet like the tapas and other places in the shopping center.  I will definitely come here again. I want to really try the wings! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Okay.....first of all......whoever put \"dressy\" in the description was being totally ironic. 
I drove by this place a couple of times and thought......\"hmmmmm....that's a dinky little place.\" During this last visit to Henderson, I decided to Yelp what's good in the area.....and lo and behold.....this sucker popped up. I called the place to make sure it was open because some yelpers suggested this place has funky hours. Anywho......the man said it was open till \"a quarter to 7 on Saturdays\" 
We ordered the Italian Beef and the Hot Dog. The basic dog comes with mustard, pickle, hot peppers, and onions. I'm a wuss when it comes to hot spicy things so I spit it out and soon as it hit my mouth. (I'm usually not a spitter) But the dog was delicious! The Italian beef was great......I know some of you are going to hate me for this but I think if I added kethup to it......it would be better. 
It's a stand so expect to roast with the outside cockroaches waiting for your order. :)"}
{"text":"Ate the polish dog with French fries again today, always excellent. Got there early, before they were open. Joe asked me what I wanted and I told him. He brought it out to me out the back door, now that's CUSTOMER SERVICE! I have eaten there several times and will continue to eat there for the delicious food and customer service."}
{"text":"Hot diggity dog this place rocks!  Came here today (like literally just now.  That's how excited I am to write this review) for the first time ever.  I drive by all the time but have never stopped.  Today, however, was the day.  And my lucky day it was!
I ordered a Vienna dog with just ketchup, mustard and onions.  Adventurous, I know.  The cool dude working there asked if I wanted fries and I declined but he kindly said, \"Eh, I'm going to throw some in anyway.\"  While my waistline may not appreciate that, my taste buds sure as hell did!  How is it that the smallest mom and pop rinky dink (no offense, Hot Dog Heaven) places have the best freaking french fries?!?!  They were good.  Thicker than shoestring but thinner than a steak fry.  Cooked perfectly - warm and soft potato on the inside and yet cooked enough so that there was just the slightest crunch on the outside.  (Am I a fry connoisseur or what?  Fatty, fatty two by four...).  No joke - even if the dog sucked, the fries would have made everything right.  
The hot dog was great.  Generous portion of condiments and the dog itself was good - you can't go wrong with a Vienna.  The only issue I had with it was that the top of the bun got super soggy by the time I was down to the end of it (which i couldn't even finish, by the way, on account of the french fry scarf down that took place prior to even taking a bite of the dog).  Had it not been for that (and maybe I'm being too nitpicky about it) this would have been a solid 5 star joint. 
Note that there isn't any inside seating here (at least not that I saw).  It's a small shack (for lack of a better word) that only has a walk-up window.  There are a few tables out front that you can sit and eat at but they fill up quickly.  Word to the wise - this place gets packed busy around lunchtime so get here early (or late) to avoid the rush.  Oh!  And check the mirror afterwards - those pesky little poppy seeds lodged in your teeth are NOT cute."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Outdoor carryout window. Wonderful on a gorgeous day, better take it back to your car on a terrible one. Not really a parking lot to speak of so you'll have to park on the side street. Guys who work there are hilarious and friendly. 

Food: I had the Italian Beef. It was amazing. A little on the greasy side, but the giardiniera was awesome. The beef was tender and juicy. It was everything I'd expect an Italian Beef to be. We also had the chili cheese fries. Reminded me of the chili I get back home in Michigan. Creamy but spicy. Totally worth the drive across the city for me."}
{"text":"I see that we all agree that the service is terrible here.  Who has a business and treats their customers like crap???? Really??? This should be appropriately renamed HOT DOG HELL!!!!!! We all just need to boycott this business by not patronizing it so that he is forced to close.  
We visited here once and there was a guy that was very nice and that's why we returned.  When we returned there was another guy who was beyond rude. They don't use gloves so you know the guy is not washing his hands and handling the food.  Yuck!  The thought of it just makes me sick.  We won't be back that's for sure.   Nasty in all respects!!"}
{"text":"Very mom and popish, which is a good thing. Looks like that part of the establishment could be their home. I get that it use to be that way, back in the day,love that aspect. The service was decent, could use more chili on the chili cheese dog, less batter on the onion rings, the corn dogs ate pretty good. 1st timer, but we will try it out again in the future. I have family in the neighborhood so, we will make another trip here again in the future."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! Good Chicago dog and GREAT Italian beef with sweet peppers!  The Chicago dog had oodles of toppings... almost so much that the flavor of the dog was somewhat lost.  The Italian beef was moist and flavorful!  Would definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to O'armour's since the early 80's when I went to high school just down the street.  Now I only get to go when visiting from the west coast.  The food is good and cheap.  One thing that has always appealed to me is that they have malt vinegar for the fries, a taste I picked up at Arthur Treacher's in the 70's."}
{"text":"great chicago food uses viena beef or closest to it that we can find. Bad thing is he doesnt accept any other form of payment accept cash.  We usually order the italian beef sandwich with extra mozzarella and a chicago dog and a chili dog. All the food is very good. The service on the other hand is really bad so i suggest if you are already having a bad day do not go here. They practically spit on you while you are paying them to keep them in business. Very rude and if you dont ask for napkins you will not get them. We would eat here a lot more often if the old man at the front was any sort of respectful."}
{"text":"I'm drooling onto my keyboard right now.
Like hot dogs? Want to make your taste buds throb? That's right, throb.

Pros?
-Curly fries are amazing!
-BEST tasting hot dogs I've ever had
-Delicious chili, cheese, etc. for toppings
-Always hot and fresh
-Great place for groups
-Fast service
-Fun music, jukebox
-CHEAP

Cons?
-Not one!"}
{"text":"If you are local to Amherst, this is a solid choice for food! The hotdogs are fresh off the grill, they had a good selection of toppings, and if you do the bacon it's actually bacon. Not that bacon bits type crap. The fries are to die for and the staff is extremely friendly. They're kind of small hot dogs for the price, but I don't mind paying extra to support a local business."}
{"text":"great value for what you get, especially the topping. i normally load up my hotdog with beacon and chili.

 very fast service. as soon as we finish ordering and find a table to sit down, the food will be brought to us. The fries are really good. skinny and crispy type."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Hotdog Heaven. The hotdogs are the best, and we love the fresh cut fries. We go home with happy bellies."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after hearing some folks talking about it recently.  Very cozy little spot located inside of an old home (which was fun).  The menu board at the counter can take some time to sift through, so best to come prepared by checking out their online menu.  Food was served quickly to our table.  Unfortunately, a little disappointed in the dogs I ordered, as the chili was not very tasty, and the cheese was cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese.  The dogs themselves were good, though.  The fries were shoestring-style, which was a unique variation.  One heads up that I'm sure is mentioned elsewhere...refills of beverages are $.25, so come with your quarters ready!  When I mentioned that all I had was a credit card, they did give me a free refill, which was a nice touch.

Not sure I'll be back, but it's worth checking out if you've never been."}
{"text":"Ordered: 2 chili cheese dogs + small fry
Price: $6 and change

Ambiance: Pretty quaint place with an equally quaint/small parking lot. The restaurant itself is a little cramped with maybe 6 tables on the first floor. The service was super quick because they have dogs on the grill going all the time so all you really wait for is the fries/sides.

Food: Pretty solid dogs about the size of a Hebrew national dog served in a warm soft bun. The flavor was nice and beefy and I liked the slight browning they do on the grill. The chili was somewhat sweet and paired well with the slightly tangy cheese sauce. Overall I had no real complaints, not mind-blowing by any means but hot dogs seldom are for me.
The fries were of the shoe-string variety, decent crisp and freshly fried although mine were fairly greasy and pretty salty. I did enjoy them with the seasoning salt on the table though which had a nice hint of heat.

Overall a pretty good hot dog place with fair prices, not pushing any gourmet standards by any means but it's a great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this place in over 12 years so I decided to take hubby to try it out and see if it was still any good. There is no drive-thru, this is a small little building where you walk-up and place your order. If there is actual parking for this place someone let me know because it seems people still just pull up along the curb, hop out and order, get their food then roll out. I just figure the parking situation adds adventure to the experience ha! There is seating right outside of the ordering window which is nice, if mother nature is being nice :)

As I walked up to the window I immediately recognized the owner. He is a character for sure! He let me know he was celebrating 18 years in the same location. I told him I had read in the Review Journal a few years back that Celine Dion liked to stop at Hot Dog Heaven for a hot dog on her way home. The owner had an immediate response that had both my husband and myself laughing so hard! I'd repeat what he said, but it might not be appropriate so just trust me it was hilarious or ask yourself next time you stop by! 

So I ordered a \"Vienna All Beef Hot Dog\" priced at $2.79 on the menu board, but I was charged $2.89 before taxes. It's only 10 cents, but still the prices should be listed correctly. I asked for mine loaded so it came on a poppy seed bun and had a pickle, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers and true green relish. I asked for the celery salt to be left off.  This hot dog was as good as I remembered it. It really is a simple thing yet hits the spot. I also ordered \"Chili Cheese Fries\" priced at $4.19 and the chili cheese fries only come in one size unlike the plain fries. The chili cheese fries can easily be shared between 2 or more people. The chili is made from scratch and being a Chicago joint there is no beans in the chili. The chili was pretty good, but not as good as Original Tommy's. The fries are nice and fat so they hold up the chili and cheese nicely. Hubby ordered a \"Maxwell Street Style Polish Dog\" that was priced on the menu at $4 and some change, yet I was charged $5.19 for it before tax. Look, I really don't mind paying whatever you are charging if it is fair, but it needs to be posted correctly or it is just misleading and people will wonder about shadiness. 

They serve Coca-Cola here as well Barq's root beer if that is your thing.

They only take CA$H MONEY for payment, so stop at a bank or have some cash on you because cash is king at this place."}
{"text":"I love hot dogs so I was really excited to try this new place that recently opened in Southern Highlands. I guess this chain specializes in Chicago dogs and has been in business for 51 years. Although I don't know what a Chicago dog is supposed to taste like, I do know I didn't dig this dog very much.

I ordered the Chili Dog (with cheese and onions) for $4.50 and Cheese Fries for $4.29. The dog was regular size and was more like a lukewarm dog. The chili and cheese were just okay and the bread was stale on the ends. The only thing I liked about my meal were the fries. They were nothing special but at least they were made fresh and it was a good portion.

The service was good.  We were greeted and were thanked as we left.  I don't think I'd be back again when there are so many other wiener options in town. I'd rather get a hot dog and a drink from Costco for $1.50.

2.5 stars."}
{"text":"It's a pity Northern Ohio has some unwarranted prejudice toward hot dogs. Unlike other nearby cities, there is a real lack of good hot dog joints   Somehow our good citizens think the ground meat and processed chicken that makes up their burgers and McNuggets are more pristine and healthful. Oh well. Back to HDH-I love this place. Chili Dogs. Slaw Dogs. Cheese Dogs. Dogs with Brown Mustard. And some of the best hot, flavorful fries I've had in a long time.Got the munchies? Want to feed the kiddies cheap? Go!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY - OWNER'S ATTITUDE SAYS SO
The owner's bad attitude toward customers hasnt changed but the quality of products has and is causing me to pull this place down from LasVegasBestHotDogs dot com. Used to have high quality products and was right up there with the best in town, but as everyone can see by multiple reports, the Attitude Sucks and the quality has followed suit."}
{"text":"I went to this place twice, the first time someone grumpily told me that they were not open yet (I thought it was close to noon, maybe I was wrong, but it didn't matter, I do not like to be talked to in that manner).  The second time was on July 14th, 2014.  There were several people eating and cars were parked on the side street and I had to park and walk about 1/2 a block back to the business.  An older man took my order.  I asked if their Chili was homemade.  He assured me it was.  I ordered a Coney  with mustard and onion, and a hot dog with mustard and onion.  The Coney and hot dog were rather small and the Chili was the same as Hormel canned chili.  I have eaten hot dogs and Coney's all over the U.S, in about every state I've been in.   This Coney as about as generic, as they come, and if the sauce was homemade, he must have added water to the canned chili to make it so.  The hot dog was average with nothing to make it special or any different than you'd get at a convenience store.  The bill was $7.00.  I do not know about other sandwiches that they serve, so I can't comment on them, only on what I ate.  I would suggest, if you eat at this place, order something other than Coney's and hot dogs as they were disappointing, and do not be surprised, if you are  treated gruffly."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!  Took our family of five here.  Had the family meal.  Was plenty to feed us.  The fires our amazing and with the family meal you get a heaping plate.  We'd been saying for years we wanted to go here, we should have gone sooner.  One of our new favorite places for sure!"}
{"text":"Never mind the grumpy man taking your order - that's all part of the experience!

The hot dogs are worth the wait (usually 10-15 minutes), but I warn you: they are regular-sized hot dogs - like you would cook at home.  Therefore, I suggest you order two of whatever you're going to eat or change it up and order one of each!

The Vienna hot dog was excellent with peppers that had just enough kick and didn't leave you looking for the nearest fire hydrant.  I also had the cheese fries which is basically fries in Velveeta cheese.  Nothing crazy there, I guess.

I don't usually frequent this area, but when I'm there - I'm here... if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"I mean the name says it all! 

I just started working up in Lorain a few months ago. I do not know the area well b/c I grew up in Massillon and went to school at KSU. My coworkers invited me to join them for lunch at \"Hot Dog Heaven\". My eyes lit up with excitement b/c the name alone rocks... and who doesn't enjoy hot dogs?!?! It is a cool old house near downtown Amherst. The staff is friendly and helpful. There are so many hot dog topping and menu choices to choose from. Even if you do not care for hot dogs there are plenty of other delicious treats you can try. They even have chocolate covered banana's! And any place that has stadium mustard on hand is clutch! 
My only complaint is that they have Pepsi products. I am a Coca-Cola girl and fountain Coke is the best! 

Definitely visit Hot Dog Heaven is you are ever near Lorain Co. You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The guy taking the orders was a rude moron. Dudes ego reeks big time. He thinks he's cool acting like obnoxious fool but it's a real turn off. Hotdogs average at best and very small. Never again."}
{"text":"No joke here: Best Italian beef outside of the original Taylor street Al's. Chicago dogs that would be a destination in Chicago - let alone Vegas. A must-visit for any Chicago ex-pats craving a taste of home.  Take it from this former Chicago food tour guide! Hotdog Heaven is the real deal."}
{"text":"It's Gone! Thought they were changing the sign yesterday and drive by today and the place is empty. Not sure if they moved, no sign indicating that. So assume they went out of business."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy going to hot dog heaven. I have been going there for years with my family. They have a very good cheese sauce they put on their cheese dogs and their French fries are very good. The staff is always very friendly. It is a little expensive just for hotdogs but with coupons it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"Dropped into the heaven on lunch break with my buddy Tony.  Both of us are from the Chicago area so we were starry eyed walking up to the window to order at this streetside hut.

The order taker will serve you up a dose of all in good fun attitute to go along with your lunch.  You better leave a tip or he will have something to say about it...and you better leave enough of a tip or he will say something about that too.  

Tony went for a chili cheese dog and an italian beef sandwich and a medium drink ($13.06)
I went for a vienna hot dog, chili cheese fries and a medium drink ($9.33)

Everything is served wrapped in paper and stuffed in a brown paper bag.  There are 3 rusty tables to sit at on picturesque east lake mead blvd.  The food was really good.  The italian beef was dripping out delicious juiciness.  The chicago dog was piled with toppings including two pickles an a sesame seed roll.  The chili cheese fries were excellent and HUGE!  We couldn't even finish them.  Fork definitely required for these fries!

All in all, very good.  I would say it is a bit pricey for a hot dog roadside hut but not too pricey for the portion and food...."}
{"text":"Just amazing. The hot dogs, polish sausage and the italian beef."}
{"text":"You would think that a place called Hot Dog Heaven would have super duper fantastic hot dogs.  Sadly no.  I've had better hot dogs from my microwave.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Hope they're just having growing pains. Went in today the food was OK not as good as I remembered at the other location. The sodas in the fountain were flat and when I told the guy at the counter he mumbled something about \"I'll call them about it\" Wasnt overly impressed. Will try again maybe they were just having a bad day

OK so I went by there yesterday and there was a lock and a 5 day pay rent or vacate notice. I guess their customer service got to them"}
{"text":"Not bad for Vegas but any one from Chicago will tell you the bread is wrong fix that and you got a great sandwich"}
{"text":"I give a 3 because customer service is huge and this place has zero. Everything was great even the soda was amazing.  When ordering for the first time if you don't know what you want or order incorrectly the guy gets all mad.  I'm sorry the rudeness isn't something I appreciated.  I was actually afraid to order after that.  My husband enjoyed his Italian beef immensely we had hotdogs and some chili dogs both were great.  The fries were very good.  I wouldn't stop here again unless I was on this side of town which I never am so cie la vie."}
{"text":"They do it rite! I'm from Chicago it's the real deal taste of the city all the way down to the attitude. Lol  Sure they could kill you with kindness but where would the fun be in that? The menu might be small, but who cares it's a street side stand not a candle light restaurant. The food speaks for its self, these guys brought the taste of Chicago to sin city and are crushing it. You want a hot dog? Then go to heaven, you won't be let down. 

  You will forever be missed HDH! I've never had a better fry. So long and best of luck to you folks."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since they opened. I see where a few have complained about the rudeness off the staff but I have always gotten along well with them. Maybe because I've been going there for so long. I have however heard some of the remarks they have said to other customers that would definitely be considered rude. About the food. Love it 95% of the time but on a couple of occasions the food was subpar mainly due to stale or almost stale bread. Hot dogs are my normal choice but sometimes get the beef sandwich. Also really like the fries. I don't believe they're overpriced as some due but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a local landmark. I ate here as a child. I grew up in a house where we didn't eat national fast food chains or junk food. So, coming to Hot Dog Heaven was such a huge treat. I lived in the Avon Lake area around 2003-2008. I was so excited there was a location around the corner from my house. I would visit on my \"cheat days\". This place brings back memories for me. I blame them for making my favorite food chili dogs. 

I've been living on the west side of Los Angeles since, I moved from the area. I as much as I love, our Pink's out here there is one thing missing..... vinegar. I just cannot have a chili dog and fries, without vinegar on my fries. It's just not the same. Whenever, I do eat chili dogs I subject everyone to stories about Hot Dog Heaven. Just like a grandpa. 

I just visited Ohio about a month ago. I happened to be out on my birthday and I had to have Hot Dog Heaven as my birthday treat. This place, is really like a local pizza shop in some locations. But we in Ohio are a bit different. Our awesome landmark place is a hot dog place. Goodness, do I love my hot dogs!

Oh, they have Cleveland's famous Stadium Mustard. People on the west coast have no idea what Stadium Mustard is. I even have a bottle in my house to show everyone the amazing taste. So, if you order a hot dog here it's not complete without Stadium Mustard."}
{"text":"The jumbo all beef hotdog is my favorite and the fresh cut fries are to die for. The ice cream is great also. The place it's self is cozy. Every time I get a chance to go I go there when I'm craving a great hotdog and fries."}
{"text":"When People ask me where I grew up I tell them Amherst,  They look puzzled for a sec.....I then inform them, you know, \"Hot Dog Heaven\"  and the light clicks.

This place is amazing.........Best Tube Steak Hands Down~

The restaurant is always clean,  Everything is Fresh.  I am a loyal, everytime I visit Lorain County this is my first destination stop!

Fries are amazing!  I love mine w/ a side of cheese ;0)"}
{"text":"I like this place because i ate here as a kid, they have malt vinegar for the fries, they put a giant (GIANT!) santa out front during the holidays, it s in an old house and i always wonder whats upstairs, it s named hot dog heaven, they have a juke box."}
{"text":"I was pressed for time but belly was quite angry and demanded to be reckoned with. I needed lunch fast. Hot Dog Heaven delivered my meal quickly.

The place is a little shack on the side of the road with only outdoor seating. The place is cash only. The menu is dogs and Italian Beef for the most part.

I ordered the Chili Cheese dog with chopped onion. The dog is sourced from Vienna Beef, the chili is homemade per the menu and comes in a poppy seed bun. The dog carries a $4 with tax price tag.

It was served fast and consumed by yours truly but it was a bit on the small side. I left wanting a bit more for my buck."}
{"text":"The last two times I took the time to drive out here to get a dog I have been disappointed.  The buns are old, smashed, no poppy seeds, they seem like they are giving up.

I can understand raising your prices to improve or maintain quality, but to raise prices and serve old hard, smashed and torn buns???

I used to love this place but they are no longer worth my time or money.  For the same price or less now, I can get a dog with a fresh bun from a place closer to home.

It makes me sad that the quality has been given up on.  This is not a place I will be going back to anymore.  Two bad experiences with the hot dogs, shame on me if I give them a 3rd opportunity to disappoint.  

I won't be recommending this place anymore which is sad."}
{"text":"I would give this place NO stars if possible. I work around the corner from this place. The hot dogs are just ok. Nothing special. the guy that takes the orders is a total ass. I have been there 3 times and will never return. in fact, no one in my office will go back.

His attitude is that he does not need, nor really want my business or anyone elses for that matter.

There are better hot dogs with finer owners/employees in town."}
{"text":"Just like Chicago! A dumpy shack with screwball staff and the best tasting dogs and cheese fries! You could skip the cheese on the fries, but that just means you're not from Chicago. If the staff gives you a hard time, it's part of the schtick and adds a Chicago feel. If they give you a hard time, don't be afraid to talk back... It's a Chicago thing. If you want smiles, high fives and crappy food (west coast thing) head on over to wiener schnitzel or Pinks and enjoy your mystery dog with government chez whiz....."}
{"text":"By far the best hot dog stand in town. If you want a good Chicago style dog then come here. The owner is down to earth and a really good guy. I have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"If you can deal with the bald guy with the glasses (I believe he's the owner) attitude it's a decent dog. I thought maybe the first time he was having a bad day but after the third time I realized no he's just an (hate to say it) asshole."}
{"text":"One of those roadside places you wouldn't normally give business to. The chili cheese dog was good but really small for the $4.11 I paid. They aren't much on saying \" Thank You\" or anything. Just handed my dog and that was that. I wouldn't go back again, but it's not to say it's a bad place. They just need to work on their people skills."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to say that when I went today they told me that they were CLOSED FOR GOOD. I guess a bank will be at this location now instead."}
{"text":"We're Chicago transplants, so whenever we get a craving for an Ital Beef or Chicago Dog...this is our go-to spot! Sometimes they get busy & you have to wait a bit, but trust me the food is worth the wait! Hot & fresh. My son loves to talk to the old guys that work the stand too. :) Definitely check them out...."}
{"text":"One word comes to mind when I think about Hot Dog Heaven, \"AMAZING.\" I have been eating at HDH since I was a little girl. Rarely can someone mention that they are from Amherst and not have someone say, \"Isn't that where that great hotdog place is?\"

HDH is located in a charming little house in downtown Amherst. I always thought this was cool because when my dad was younger he actually lived in second floor of this house.

I highly recommend their chili-dog. I am not even a fan of chili and I am in love with theirs! They also have amazing fresh cut french fries. Saturate them with a ton of vinegar and they as close to heaven as you can get!

Because HDH is very small inside it can get very busy before and after local sporting events. Many teams come to get ice cream after their big game. 

If you are in Amherst, Ohio it should be mandatory that you give this place a try! It will not let you down!!!"}
{"text":"I sorta  miss  one thing about  My Chicago roots --  Its   this place..Yes it has it all...   great dogs- great sausage-  great beef and --- attitude---  like  all the Chi town places  My dad took me to \" back in the day\" He even taught me how to order and  get the\" Eff \" out of da way .    I used to come here  with him  when he had  some business here   He always  said   this town could use a  real sausage  beef  and  hot dog stand   Well  its got one  .   
*** unless  your one of the \" Mary's\" (evan)  below  who are  scared of a hot dog stand... or  were expecting a kiss from the  owner?  LOL  enjoy  the  taste of  a real Chicago sausage beef and hot dog  stand"}
{"text":"Yummy! We were in the area for special trip to Tractor Supply (don't ask), and were hungry at 10:30 am. Thankfully, this place opens at 10:30. Huzzah! Cheap, delicious dogs here. Plenty of toppings. Good cole slaw and chili for the dogs. A cute little hometown place - local sports heros on the walls, etc. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere - the place is actually in a turn of the century-ish house. 

No five stars if you don't have all beef dogs (Vienna Beef and the like), and the dogs aren't as snappy as the best places. But you can't go wrong with this place for a quick, cheap lunch. We'll be back."}
{"text":"When it's really hot outside, waiting for food at Hot Dog Heaven can be uncomfortable.  As many yelpers note, it's a little shack across the street from Walgreen's near the corner of Lake Mead Parkway and Boulder Highway.  The good news is that they are usually pretty quick in getting the food out.  So, usually it's not totally terrible.

We get just about everything on the menu, my favorite is the Italian beef with hot peppers and mozzarella.  I sometimes get the combo beef with Italian sausage.  This is a huge sandwich that sometimes falls apart, but it's delicious.  The beef is very tender and flavorful, and the sausage adds some nice spice.  You can get hot or sweet peppers, I highly recommend hot.  Goes great with the beef.

We also get the hot dogs, both traditional Chicago dogs and chili dogs with the works.  Both are around $3.50-$4.  The chili is also excellent on French fries.  Keep in mind the chili cheese fries are ENORMOUS.  Easily enough to share.  The polish sausage with grilled onions and mustard is another winner, thick and juicy sausage.  

The employees are known to be \"mean,\" but I would call them gruff at times.  There are a couple that are pretty friendly and funny.  It's a nonissue for me, just know what you want when you get up there.  When the weather's nice, stick around and eat on the picnic tables.  Overall, the food is great."}
{"text":"When going to college and telling people you were from Amherst, they are best known for Hot Dog Heaven. This place takes hot dogs to the next level and is a MUST VISIT when in town. Chili sauce is amazing. French fries are hand cut and have the skin on them. If you like a little spice, ask them for Hot Fries which are not on the menu, but they will make. It is an order of fries with 2 kinds of wing sauce. Amazing... I am literally drooling just typing this! The milkshakes are great too as is the fish and... heck, just get the hot dog and load it up with whatever toppings you like (chili, ketchup, mustard, onions, sauerkraut, jalapenos, cheese, relish, etc). 

BONUS TIP: HDH is actually an old house and the quaint little dining room has pictures of all the current high school team pictures. Hidden in the corner, is an amazing picture of the Inferno, Ricky Schneider, from his gunslinging days at Bowling Green. Take a picture and tweet it and I will send you a Canadian looney."}
{"text":"I love Hot Dog Heaven 'cause they are a mom and pop shop with excellent food! Just writing this makes me crave one of their cheese dogs. Everything I've ordered from here is tasty. From the good old Chicago Dog to the Chili Cheese Fries you can't go wrong! The poppy seed bun is moist and perfect. If you want authentic Chicago Dogs and Italian Beef you will not be disappointed.

Make sure you bring cash because they do not take plastic. They are a walk up style place and have a couple tables outside or you can eat at the counter. If your craving a hot dog check this place out! Its a rare gem in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Oh I love the fresh cut french fries and hot dogs on the warm buns with chili sauce and cheese. Get the topping on the side if you doing carry out, they do not skimp on giving you the yummy chili sauce and cheese."}
{"text":"Good hot dogs. Shared the all beef Chicago dog and chili dog with hubby and an order of fries. Service was short and curt. I felt like I shouldnt be asking any questions otherwise, NO HOT DOG FOR YOU!!!! LOL!!! Ate in the car as it was boiling hot that day and the benches by the kiosk didn't look inviting at all. Was still a bit hungry after polishing off just half of each dog so ordered another all beef. Yummy! First time I had a Chicago style dog and would go back for a fix in a heart beat, despite the Dog NAZI."}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 hot dogs and they were cold.  No refunds which is fine so won't be back and will pass on the bad news"}
{"text":"I would just redundant to all the other reviews that said that this is the best hot dog stand around. It is an Icon of the Henderson area. Very simple always busy., but always good. Great place to stop on way to Lake Mead or if you have family at hospital across from here. Get your order in your head before you step to the window. It is busy and they don't have time for you to make up your mind. Enjoy it is a must stop if your in Hendo."}
{"text":"Came only for the fries. and they were fantastic. Period. That really is all I have to say."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. I might as well make a hotdog at home. The owner was nice but the price is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ever been to Weiner Circle (or any hot dog shack in Chicago for that matter!)? If you have, you'll know what to expect from this joint. 

Dogs are Chicago style all the freaking way. The veggies, the celery salt, Vienna Beef, LOVE IT ! Italian beef sandwich is equally delicious. 

The tables are dingy, the employees are rude (but in that charming Chicago food shack sort of way), but for a trip back to Chicago in Henderson, NV I can think of no better place ! 

PS - Don't be a dumbass like me and ask if they carry celery salt. You will get publicly humiliated !"}
{"text":"Love this place for their awesome Beef Hot Dog w/ everything & the chili cheese fries are something you'll crave"}
{"text":"This place has amazing italian beef sandwiches and hot dogs stacked high with toppings  , crispy fries that are a perfect size and not greasy.it's in a cool little 1950s building , i go whenever i'm in this part of town, like once every other week . i like that they work fast so its great for lunch breaks. the downside is, they are a bit short or maybe a bit rude ,but i think that's just how people act in chicago(i don't think its done on purpose) you need to bring cash,but they have an ATM if you dont remember."}
{"text":"Have heard good things about this place for a while and finally stopped in today. The loaded dog was great along with hot fries. I was told the owner can be a bit hard to deal with but after what happened today with another customer he was great. A very kind person. Def will be back again"}
{"text":"The Vienna beef loaded dog is so damn good; filled with relish, onions, chunks of tomato and a full pickle on top, all wrapped in a poppy seed bun...delicious! And fresh, hot fries. Not over salted either. I definitely recommend hitting this spot up if you're driving through SE Las Vegas for lunch."}
{"text":"First time stop and won't be back! Kraut dog was good, but the guy was a real JERK!  I definitely would not go back. No reason to pay good money and some jerk be rude, no hot dog is worth that."}
{"text":"TERRIFIC CHILI FRIES!!! Not too soggy, they were generous with the chili as well. The dogs are well priced & the service is absolutely genuine. I can't leave without leaving atleast a few dollars in their tip jar. Needless to say, my boyfriend & I will become regulars at this establishment."}
{"text":"Insulting your customers is one of the charming attributes of this stand. If I had to sit in a shack out out in the Vegas heat, I would probably be indignant as well. It was enjoyable to watch the banter between the regulars and the workers. Yes, that's right, you get lunch and a show.

I am surprised that the guest were not as fiesty, because you either have to stand at the counter or sit at one of the two metal picnic tables outside IN THE HEAT. 

Today's order was the all beef hot dog with the works ($3.02). It is fundamentally a Chicago dog containing mustard, neon green relish, hot peppers, tomato slices, and a pickle spear. They used Vienna Hot Dogs which is a plus, but I was not completely impressed."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to love this place. There is no veggie dog so I wasn't able to get the full experience and had to settle for fries with cheese on them. They were decent. During lunch time it can get pretty busy and they've been at that location for a million years, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after several times passing it by in the last month and after reading reviews. 

It was alright. Definitely nothing overly special. The prices are too high for such a small dog and sausage. For the price, I thought I was going to get the chicago real deal BIG dog and sauasage but nah... I didnt.

i wont return."}
{"text":"Best \"dogs\" in town. You need to try the Italian Beef. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Everything is made to order.  Just a cool little hot dog stand serving some serious italian beef sandwiches.  Very close to my place so easy to get in and out with no fuss.  Always bring cash."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The beefs are good, but the owner is an insufferable a-hole. I've given them many chances, but every time I get burned. Seriously, would it kill this guy's business to hand out napkins with a messy beef?"}
{"text":"Im from Chicago and had heard that I need to get a hot dog and a beef from this place for some time now.  I got the hot dog which was so good and my husband the beef. The beef was dipped perfectly not soaking but just enough to be wet. Those from Chicago know what I mean. I was greatly pleased. I live on the southwest side of Vegas but will make the drive again."}
{"text":"Somebody get these guys a humidifier, because everything they serve is dry, dry, dry. Hot dogs are served on semi-stale buns. Italian beef is so tough and dry that not even a soaking of au jus can redeem it. And their fries are so starchy and flavorless that they represent a complete waste of calories.

Pass on this place."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a dive. It's a little shack with three benchs outside. Inside work the hotdog Nazi's.  That's the charm of Hot Dog Heaven.  I recommend the polish with grilled onions, italian sausage, or beef sandwich. And the fries are really good as well.

No credit cards though."}
{"text":"Marking this place down one star because I picked up just one chili dog here yesterday and it was fairly small for the price, and not that tasty.  

Still think that Tommy's chili dog is king."}
{"text":"This place was very good considering that a Chicago dog is only 2.50, and with fries (a huge brown bag of them) only 3.50.  I got pretty filled up from this but I saw others ordering three dogs and fries.  I would go here again manly for the price. 

 I saw another hot dog heaven location (I have no idea if they are the same) near Maryland and Silverado Ranch that looks a little spiffier than this location, but they hadn't opened yet.  They had all the Chicago food posters in the windows so I assume they are the same."}
{"text":"Man where do I start? Let's go with why we show up, the food. And it's is pretty amazing. The dogs are all pretty good. Call me crazy I don't try anything else because it's a hot dog stand. The fries. Pretty amazing. Nice and warm, just the right amount of salt and they come in a paper sack. So essentially it's like a starch edible mickeys malt liquor. I've tried all of the dogs and they are amazing. The buns are always moist and warm. And that's why we all come for the amazing good. 

Now let's get to the yang to their yin. Every employee there is a jerk. Never once have I dropped in and had anyone ever be even the slightest bit polite. I asked for a refill on my drink today and was charged a dollar. Ok no harm no foul they are not corporate I get it. I hand over a bill and the guy behind the counter pockets it! Wow not only was he  a poor excuse for customer service but he juiced me for a dollar then skims it! But hey look this is a mom and pop old school hot dog walk up stand. So I'm enjoying my fries and dog and I realize I was given 2 napkins and I had used them. I went to ask for more and was given 1 hahahaha this is how they roll. I had to plead my case for more than 1!

So let's sum this up. Good food this place never misses, drop in and have a dog. Cash only they are pretty old school about that. Don't expect a red carpet to be rolled out or maybe even a burlap sack the  way these guys treat their customers. But it's honestly an experience. It's almost like Dicks last resort meets local hot dog stand but they don't get paid to be jerks, they just really are jerks. So go have a dog and a laugh if you can deal with a guy being angry for you showing up!"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to the Lake Mead Pkwy hut I was excited that they had finally opened another location.  I arrived at 3:40pm yesterday and found new winter hours on door stating they close at 4pm.  I knocked on the window and the guy counting his drawer wouldnt look up to acknowledge me.  Why close early?  It isnt going to do anything but piss people off and you need to sell every hotdog you can to meet expenses.  I bet they close this location not sure why they dont open other huts with less overhead?  Based upon this experience and other reviews; I will just make the trip to the hut."}
{"text":"A  little window-front stand on  the corner near Boulder Highway. I like these Chicago style dogs better than Costco or other shops."}
{"text":"I laughed (hysterically) while reading the reviews for this place. I think Vegas is the only place I've ever lived (and I've lived in plenty - Orlando, Los Angeles, Dallas to name a few) where everyday people have elevated themselves to such an atmospheric status that they give perfectly great mom-pop businesses 1-2 stars because they weren't greeted accordingly or didn't feel catered to but the food was great. I mean come on people!!!! we're rating food here!!!  I get that it's all about the experience, but seriously!!  

case in point - Hot Dog Heaven. amazing hotdogs from a roadside take out only small old brick building. four stars all the way. the toppings on the loaded dog was FRESH and the bun was super soft - that seriously made me happy!!

grow a pair if you're actually are too scared to order from here...... yea the guy's abrupt (I certainly didn't get a rude vibe) fast paced know what you want kind of place as the line can get pretty long. so he keeps it moving - don't know what you want? step aside, take your time and make up your mind - don't hold the line up! next!!


loaded beef dog - topped with the classic neon relish, onions, hot pepper, pickle spear and tomatoes. really really good - fresh toppings and soft bun

Italian sausage with hot and sweet peppers - heartier bun than hot dog bun and was excellent in absorbing all the amazing juice from the sausage and peppers YUM-O!

didn't try anything else, but the table next to us had cheese fries and that thing was HUGE"}
{"text":"Loved the guy taking our order - don't change, man!  Loved the Italian beef sandwich even more!!!  It was sloppy, juice, fiery (hot peppers), and freakin' dreamy as far as sandwiches go. Can't believe I passed this place up for the past 5 years - I missed out. I'm coming back and bringing hungry friends soon!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Hot Dog Heaven.

As with many locally owned, non-chains, the prices are not going to be as low as you could find elsewhere.  This is a family owned hot dog stand located on E. Lake Mead Pkwy, just before Boulder Highway.

The Italian beef is very good, and you can get it \"dipped,\" just as you would in Chicago.  The Chicago dog is also great.  I am not a big hot dog fan in general, but don't mind Chicago dogs because of all of the toppings.

I love seeing all of the complaints about the owner being rude - have you ever actually been to Chicago?!!  Good lord, if you ever visit the Windy City - DO NOT visit \"The Weiner's Circle,\" because you will probably leave crying.

Here's a tip:  stand back, read the menu and KNOW WHAT YOU WANT before you get up to order.  Save everyone the time and trouble by being prepared.  Ain't nobody got time to explain what everything is!

Another tip:  it is CASH ONLY, so stop at the ATM before you get there."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing experience.

I visited Hot Dog Heaven near the end of January, 2012.  It is located in what was formerly Famous Uncle Al's Hot Dog & Grill.  While that place was decent overall, it was immensely better than the current eatery.

First Impressions:

The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the feel that someone found an abandoned hot dog restaurant, is squatting in the location, and trying to pass off their own establishment.  Leftover, mismatch and weird decor is everywhere.  It just feels like a strange place the moment you step in the front door.

Menu:

The front of the menu states Hot Dog Heaven has \"51 Years in Business\".  I can not imagine how this is true, at this location or any other.  

The hot dogs range from $3.50 to $4.59, depending on what type you get.  The party I was with tried several different types, all equally disappointing.  You can also get a plain dog for $2.50, which is located in the 'Side Orders' section for some reason.  Ridiculously over priced for the size and quality of the dogs.

The actual dog is a standard, small, boiled hot dog with very little flavor.  As they were prepared, we were shocked to find the cook just grabbed them out of a tray, slapped them on a bun, and started topping them.  He had a griddle right next to him, why not toss the dogs on there for even 30 seconds to add some bite and flavor?

The chili on the chili dogs was bland, can quality at best.  Again, very little flavor.  The tiniest sprinkle of cheese was added, and plain white onions.  There seemed to be no interest in sprucing them up a bit in any way.  It was like I was in line at a school cafeteria. 

The kraut dog was awful, to the point where my friend didn't even want to finish it.   

They also have Hot Wings which are, believe it or not, $9 for 7 wings.  They do come with a handful of fries, but at that price you should get double the wings at least.  Even a pickle (yes, just 1 whole, bulk purchased pickle), will cost you $1.59.

The soda machine seems to be constantly broke, as one of my friends mentioned it was that way when he went his one and only time as well.  

Overall:

I could not be more disappointed in a place.  I was really hoping for a great local hot dog eatery, but this is not it.  Steer clear, while it's still open."}
{"text":"Another stop I have to make when I travel back to the North Coast and my former home.  It is a little different now that Jack O'Flanagan retired and sold the place.  Jack always remembered me from the days he coached me in football and always asked about how Mom was doing.

The good news is the dogs and fries are the same as always, delicious!

I don't think I've ever had anything other that plain dogs with sauce, sometimes sauce and onions and an order of fries.  They are my favorite and I have no interest in trying anything else since I don't get here too often anymore.  The dogs are tasty, have a nice snap to them and the sauce is exactly that, a chili sauce.  Not a lot of meat but a lot of flavor.  The fries till have the skin and there is no doubt they are fried in peanut oil  Really missed them until recently when a local burger joint in Northern KY opened and they cook their fires the same way.  In my opinion it is the only way.

I got there in the middle of the afternoon before the after school rush and pretty much had the old living room to myself.  They bring your food out to you and always include a sheet of coupons.  Can't wait to get back again."}
{"text":"Best hot dog in town. Love me a Chicago dog, pure deliciousness and crispy fries and it's a cheap lunch to boot. For everyone that says the owner is a ass, that's half the reason we all go there. No over sensitive snowflakes in sight he keeps you away and the rest of us get to enjoy our lunch.

Chicago dog + no snowflakes = best lunch in town. I think I need to go for another dog."}
{"text":"Hot Dog Heaven is indeed the place I'd like to go when I die.

Hot dogs, fries, shakes ... all done to perfection. If you ARE going to get a hot dog though, you gotta go jumbo all beef. It's the only way. 
My favourite way to get my dog dressed? 
\"Hot Dog w/Melted Cheese and Bacon.\" 
Literally, not for the faint of heart. It is a salt-fest that would make any well-tuned ticker stop dead in it's tracks ... which is maybe another reason for the name of the establishment evoking themes of the afterlife.

Located in a converted \"old-timey\" house, eating at Hot Dog Heaven is like eating in your own home ... if your home suddenly had a row of deep fryers, a grill and an array of folks ready to take your order.

It is so much like home that, after ordering a massive amount of food, the gentlemen who was working brought an extra chili cheese fries just because we \"hadn't tried them.\" And they were GOOD! I am not a huge Chili fan myself, but this is exactly what \"topping chili\" should be like.

You like hot dogs? Well DUH! Go to Hot Dog Heaven!"}
{"text":"This place was great food. The beef sandwich was just like you find in shy town. 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a quick bite. I was expecting more specialty dogs, which they don't really have. Instead, it's your choice of standard dog or large dog and then pick your toppings (roughly 10 to choose from)

Good food - went with chili cheese dog and fries. Add the seasoning to the fries for a nice kick. 3 stars because it wasn't anything unique or spectacular, but it was good.

Good service - fast, which is all you really care about at a place like this.

Good atmosphere - restaurant is an old home converted into a restaurant, and it feels that way - but it was very clean and they had a great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I drive by here every Thursday on the route I work....I really want to try the hot dogs here but the damn Italian beef with sweet peppers and mozzarella is so friggen good I will go to say gimme 1 hot dog but Italian beef always come out instead!!

If there is a line ....know what you want or step aside til you do...they like to keep everyone moving and not waiting!!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 3 stars because that's what the dogs. I'm not in New York or Chicago, but with the hype I heard of this place, I thought it would be comparable. Sadly I was mistaken. I tried two dogs, a polish and a Chicago. They weren't bad, but not something I'm going out of my way for ever.  It's a small booth with a window and lines can get long, so make up your mind quickly. It's also a cash only business, and while I understand that for business reasons, more likely than not I don't have cash and would rather pay the extra 35 cents for convenience of not having to deal with cash. It's 2015, that's really not too much to ask. 
Final verdict: if you're in a sausage mood and in the area then by all means stop by and chow down. But I say go in with an open mind and hard cash in your hand"}
{"text":"It has kind of lost its luster. We've been visiting here for over 25 years and it seems as if the prices went up as the quality of the dogs went down. Trying too hard to compete with Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are great but the owners attitude is piss poor obviously he could care less because he talks to everyone like this. Don't dare give him a 20 dollar bill or he will give you even more attitude. Really sad because this little place has some great potential but I don't care who you think you are you shouldn't talk to customers with the attitude he does."}
{"text":"It's a little shack on a dirt lot that serves up good hot dogs.  Simply, that's what Hot Dog Heaven is in a nutshell.  Don't go for ambience.  Definitely don't go for service, I was berated for having nothing smaller than a 20.00 for my order that came to about six bucks, but at the same time, it's kind of it's charm.  It's the building equivalent of a hot dog stand.  I've seen a number of reviews citing the rudeness to the patrons and it's all true but still I feel the hot dog is good enough to continue patronizing the joint.  I've become desensitized, I guess you would say, and I'm almost amused and often engage in the terse and curt banter that goes back and forth.  If I didn't know better, I 'd think he was that way on purpose in order to maintain a type of mystique about the place when people talk about it.  So when you want to feed your hot dog fix and get grumpily served, I say go there at least once."}
