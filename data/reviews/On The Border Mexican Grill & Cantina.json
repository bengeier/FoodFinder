{"text":"If you want a good Margarita you will love this place and their Guac live is really good too....I agree with the other the food needs some help but if you like Margarita's and Chips and Salsa this is the place to go..."}
{"text":"The refried beans and tacos are in a class by themselves! Really great in comparison to others. Everything else we've tried was similarly great EXCEPT for the Wak a Mole!  They tried twice and still got it wrong.  Love the place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"El lugar es muy bonito, la música es súper agradable, la comida es deliciosa, muy bien servida, buen recibimiento con nachos y un dip, lo recomiendo, excelente atención, el ambiente muy tranquilo, buen lugar para compartir en familia."}
{"text":"We have been here before and we liked the outside seating.  It was an ok restaurant but, after today we will never return.  We sat ourselves in the outside patio.....hostess said he would catch up to us!  It was a disaster.   Dirty dishes all over. Tables were all dirty.  Waitresses walking over menus on the ground. Our waitress was almost half alert.  Never to return."}
{"text":"We received probably the worst service we've ever had. We had 3 different waiters each only came to our table once. We only received one drink refill that took a half hour to get. The food was the worst mexican food imaginable. Think taco bell but they have chimichangas. Our order took forever to fill and was brought to the table wrong, so we waited again. Even after a comp meal and $15 off our dinner for 5 and an appetizer (queso and guac, a small soup bowl of semi soft cheese and a plate with a mashed avocado $8.5)  still cost over $60. Left a small tip and we will never be back."}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo, crowded but still fast service.  Ok, the drinks were a bit slow in getting to us but the bar was slammed.  Good size portions, even the \"lunch\" fajitas was enough for dinner.  The remainder of the Border sampler got the \"dogie bag\" treatment.  Very pleasing mojito, not too much liquor and the lime was not overpowering.  Too full for dessert.  Total for 2 people $50 including 2 beers, 1 mojito and tip.  Kids may not like this type of food.  It depends on their tastes.      Slightly loud because of Cinco de Mayo day."}
{"text":"Food was good. Liked the stacked Nachos. Baja combo was also good. Overall it was okay for the cost."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was awesome!!!  always a good time i've been here a few times and it's a similar story!"}
{"text":"Walked in, told them I was there for dessert and I didn't need a menu, got sat down with my family.  Waited about 10 minutes and said screw it got up and left. Had at least two waitresses walk by multiple times. The area I was sitting in only had two other tables with people at them so it's pretty obvious that we were new.  Won't be going here again..."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute worst. If your looking for good Mexican food I would not suggest it. To begin with the two girls working at the front are extremely rude. Their treatment to me and my guests was very disturbing. When we finally sat down after a 1 hour wait (we were 4 people) no one had shown up to take our orders for a long while. The inside decor is also very ugly & not pleasing. Then when we finally ordered the food took ages to get here. I got a huge meat burrito and when I started digging in the food was cold & not seasoned well. We ended up paying way too much for food that was not worth the price and service that was inconvenient. Also, to top it all off, on our way out a stranger in front of us was also leaving, stood to the side by a tree, and threw up. It was disgusting. I am never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Really really friendly staff! Food is eh- it could use a little work but the tortilla and chips are fresh. I've never had a problem here. Drink specials are excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been to several On The Border locations and this one was not up to par. We arrived around 5pm on a Sunday with larger group of 6 people with two guests who are deaf. Our server was less then please to deal with what seemed to be an extreme inconvenience to her. She was short with us and seemed to be jarred by any sort of request we had.  Our meal took quite awhile and no soups or salads came before the meal. We asked our server about the salad our family member ordered and she said \"well your order is already up so I'll have to bring it with everything else\". Once our dinners arrived they were cold. I had a cheese crisp and chicken tortilla soup. Both cold, I told our very irritated, hurried server that it wasn't even warm and she took back the soup I told her I wanted to keep the cheese crisp because I was very hungry and didn't want to eat without my party. Once she (actually it was two others who brought out the orders - our server seemed irritated by us and made little effort to attend to our table) returned w my soup and my sister in laws soup they were beyond hot, I was shocked they would bring it out like that. My chicken tortilla soup had little to no flavor. The crisp was fine for it being cold, would have been good hot.  We had to ask multiple times for waters and drink refills. My brother and mother split chicken fajitas and they were cold and dry.  It was just a very blah, uneventful (but annoying) experience with bland cold food. Not the normal experience I've gotten from other locations."}
{"text":"Get the queso!  Actually, I enjoy both the queso and the salsa; they are also good together.  The chips are huge; you'll have to break them up to make them manageable.  I've tried all of the enchilada flavors now and prefer the beef ones just because they come with red sauce.  The rice is a little sweet because of the corn, and the beans have a hint of a roasted flavor.  If at all possible, save room for the kahlua ice cream pie - delicious!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here and was greeted very professionally, and seated with a Hispanic male server. Before I knew it he had passed us off to a a white woman server. So the service was quite non chalant. Tina the server treated us okay. She was more of an order taker and did not seem to care about our experience. She never asked if we wanted any appetizers or any bar drinks. That is okay the food was okay but the thing that got me was she was throwing the n-word around like dollar bills at a strip club. I only mention this because me and my family are African-American. Guess we'll never go here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Last time I went there I got fajitas. It was good, and the service and the price were ok. I like the atmosphere there."}
{"text":"I have always liked On The Border--good but not great food, drinks and service.  However, the service we had tonight was horrible.  When we were first seated, someone basically threw a bowl of chips on our table without even saying hello.  Then the waiter came and seemed quite pleasant but took FOREVER to bring our drinks.  When I order a $10 drink, I expect better service.  We waited on our queso dip for an eternity.  When our food FINALLY came out, our waiter asked if we still wanted the queso--no apology.  We said yes, but it wasn't the size or type of queso we ordered.   We went with it just to speed things up.  Asked for more chips and salsa--none were brought--is it too much to expect them to bring chips with the cheese dip?  My husband finally went to the bar to ask for chips.  We had to flag down the manager to get water refills--I was not going to wait for another overpriced drink.  The bill had an extra item we didn't even order.  Ugh!  I'm not sure we'll ever be back!"}
{"text":"New Manager is ruining this business. Group of 25-30 of us have been several times and former Manager was grateful for our business and would reserve the patio for us. New Guy, not. Seriously we all ordered drinks and a meal and this guy wants us to go else where. Next time we will!"}
{"text":"Service is great and food has plenty of flavor, just wish it was closer to my house"}
{"text":"Pretty good tex mex deal.  I had a conference at Northlake area and went here for lunch last week.  They have a good menu and the bartender was super helpful.  Would def go back if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Expensive and not very tasty. The chips and salsa are horrible. We will never return... Ever! With Lindo Michoacan is down the street why did we ever stop here???"}
{"text":"This will be our last visit to OTB. We've always enjoyed the food but the service has been on a consistent decline our last few visits.  We've interacted with four staff members and their indifference is extraordinary.  The staff will teach great lessons I. Humility as you have to beg for pretty much anything. At least you can refill your water in the sink if you don't mind tap.  Order came out incorrect but we were so hungry and running short on time so just gave up."}
{"text":"A roach was found in my girlfriends food. When you work hard to enjoy a meal it is our desire to go to places worthy of our hard earned money. What else can I say? You want our money please upgrade. Double check... Triple check. Or bypass all together."}
{"text":"Where the food was basic the service made me want to go anywhere else by here. I am front tx and on the border is everywhere. This place doesn't remind me of home. I would go away again but here. We had to beg for someone to bring us another anything. People be aware. Second time here and it was worse. The server spend the whole time talk to table behind me. Me food was cold and if had checked on us once the problem could have gotten fixed. The manager seem like he could have cared less when I let him know which about the time we had to walk to the hostess stand to let him know. It also gave me warm fuzzies to have to hostess tell our server we were complaining about him while we were in the store. I will not be back. Ever!!!"}
{"text":"We, as a family, used to love this place until today. The server Gabriel messed all up in our visit this afternoon. We had ordered chicken (explicitly) he got us beef. He not only unapologetic about that error but made another mistake of adding the same dish twice in the invoice. When we pointed that out he was yet again unapologetic about the whole thing. Extremely poor service."}
{"text":"Just had the worst service since eating here in August. Got my order wrong, took twice as long to get the replacement , then only got one of my two enchiladas replaced and sour cream sauce that I can't eat was on both of them. My plate with beans and rice was removed before they brought my other enchilada so I didn't get to eat those either.  My friend finished her meal before I even got my first replacement and I still had to wait for the second one. The waiter called the manager over when he saw how upset I was getting. He removed my meal from the bill and charged my friend's bill to her card. On the receipt we saw that they had charged us individually for 2 enchiladas! When we called him back over he took the bill & her card, was gone a while,  then came back & told us he reversed the charges and the meal was on the house. We were very glad that he was willing to make it right but I think two bad attempts at eating there was enough. I don't like having to go home and fix dinner after going out to eat."}
{"text":"Remember when grown-ups would say things like, \"If you can't think of anything nice to say, don't say anything\"?  It wasn't the worst Tex-Mex I've ever had, and the service wasn't bad. It's very expensive for what it is. At half the price, I might've given them 2 stars."}
{"text":"I love going to On The Border. The food is great especially the Fajitas. The only thing I do not like is the seating. It is very condensed and small."}
{"text":"After rafting at the USNWC, I was craving some OTB chips and salsa, so we had a late lunch on the way home.  We found out OTB has drink specials on the Brunch menu, but those end at 2pm so try to stick to \"normal\" lunch hours on the weekend to get the best bang for your buck.  That being said, the lunch menu is active until 4pm and it includes some discounts on the normal dinner entrees."}
{"text":"In the past one of our favorites, but recently changed to sides being served family style. \"Endless bowls\" of cold rice and beans. Orders no longer come on sizzling hot plates. And wait time was excessive. Won't be returning until the old menu and serving style is brought back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I's first time.. Very impressed :) fast service, awesome food and great service! We had a fabulous lunch"}
{"text":"Place not clean at all ! Menus had sticky crap on it , cheese dip had a hair , and several tables left dirty , food was just ok , over price for what you get . Don't come here if you really enjoy Mexican food ."}
{"text":"If you like Taco Bell, then you will love this place.  It is nothing more than a fancy Taco Bell.  Definitely nothing like real mexican food.  On the bright side, the host and waitress were very nice."}
{"text":"Come on every Tuesday night.  Service is dropping in quality very fast.  Apparently they no longer serve chips and salsa unless you ask for them.  Waitress not attentive. Drinks sit empty and waiting for the bill takes too long."}
{"text":"If negative were a rating, I would give them just that.  I have been to this place 3 time to say it basically sucks.  The food is horrible and so is the service.  My first trip here I only remember the service being bad but the food was alright.  However, I returned for a lunch trip and the food was cold and made my stomach hurt.  The chips and salsa are great though!    I have avoided this place for years now.  However, the closing of the Macaroni grill (double gift card) and starvation brought me back.  And so, after we received our drinks we didnt see our waitress until mid-way through our meal.  We had to get help from another waiter.  When she finally decided to check on us, I sent my food back and the manager never made it to my table to see why!  We ordered the sampler and I hated it and my daughter got sick!  The service is so bad - You ever been to a place that the service was bad but they took your money super fast!?!?  Well this lady took our money and still took forever to return.  Why?  I was so ready to go.  I immediately remembered why I didn't want to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos and would rate them a 4. Queso for an app and it was ok. So food a three or four overall.  I was dining alone so I sat at the bar. Once I received my food attention time was over. Couldn't get a beverage refill. Couldn't get my check to pay. I was paying by credit card or else I would have just left cash on the bar and left. Since I'm in the service industry I always, always, always tip. This is the first ever that I've even considered not tipping. Still left 15% but I don't know why.  To many other options in the area to ever return. Skip it and enjoy good service by going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Plenty of eye candy here!  The HR person apparently uses that as a primary hiring criteria.  In fact, our young waiter was \"so cute\" that my wife wouldn't let me send my order back, even though two of the four plates come with something other than what we ordered.  My freind sent his back anyway.  If it wasn't for the cuteness factor, I'd have to give them two stars.    We had margaritas and beer, and the beer was the only thing with any alchohol content.  Buyer beware.  The salsa was excellent, and the food was good, but there didn't seem to be anything authentic about it."}
{"text":"Ordered empanadas to go. Three orders and $28 later...I cut them open and 75 to 80% of them were EMPTY!  (They werent great either) I called the manager and she indicated this is a known issue as they are made fresh onsite. Ok benefit of the doubt. She indicated she would send some coupons my way for throwing my cash down the drain... Has not happened.  I guess I'll be calling AMEX."}
{"text":"One thing I know for sure: I am definitely NOT 'On the Border' about this place and I am a big believer in second chances when on the fence.  My spouse and I got $200 worth of Chili's gift cards for Christmas and after quickly getting tired of their offerings decided to try some of the other places that take their gift cards. After all, we weren't paying for it out of own pockets so taking a chance on new place could be fun. On the Border was one of the places that took the gift card so I looked up their menu on-line and thought it sounded promising. So off we went with empty stomachs and high hopes of finding another great location in our neck of the woods.   We were initially pleased with the decor and cleanliness. It was around 8:30 so it wasn't too crowded - maybe 25 cars in the lot. In fact we were the only ones originally seated in our area (most of the other people were in the Cantina area.) I am wondering if this accounts for the poor service we received. Our drink orders (water) were taken and we were given a basket of overly salted chips and salsa while we looked over the menus. Our water glasses came about 10 minutes later when we were ready to order. I immediately drank the whole thing while the server was still there and remarked how thirsty the salty chips made me and requested a refill.  They were running an 'All-You-Can-Eat-Enchilada' special so we decided to try that. I took one bite of my beef enchilada and decided that was ALL I could eat! Admittedly my spouse's cheese and onion was slightly better but he agreed that he'd never order them again. The rice and beans that accompanied them were edible but still in the 'meh' category. Our server checked on us once to see if we were ready for another serving (no thanks!) Our water glasses were never refilled so I had to resort to the water bottle in my purse. We decided not to waste any more of our gift certificate on dessert.   NOTE: It surprises me that in a service-driven economy like that of Las Vegas which is suffering from high levels of unemployment, that some servers who are fortunate to still have work don't apply themselves more to making their guest's experience a good one. I am a highly generous tipper when I get superior service, even when I didn't love my meal. Furthermore, because the unemployment here is so high, these food industries should have the pick of the crop when hiring and training employees so there is no excuse for poor service regardless of the poor meal."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go with family or friends , good happy hour & friendly staff. I am addicted to their chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the servers who are so pleasant when we come here and actually give good feedback on the food and dessert we order. Parking sucks, but it's busy for a reason! Love the fajitas and also the lite options for when I want to pig out in a health way. Thanks for great moments and food :)"}
{"text":"Always a solid choice for my after-shopping munches. I appreciate their \"lower-calorie\" selection. Con: is usually loud, lots of families with kids, no drink specials Thursday-Sunday."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  The first time I went here, the food was good.  This time the food was adequate, too.  We had been shopping in the area, and decided to dine here again.  My problem was the service was dreadful - slow and inattentive!  And when I mentioned it to the manager, he was snotty to me!!  Really bad attitude!!   Defensive and angry. Their entire staff is way too young to realize the importance of good client relations.  We'll not go here again.  These chains need to hire personnel who are trained - not angry youngsters who don't care!!"}
{"text":"The margarita was awful, very chemical flavor. We ordered beef tacos and beef enchiladas and there are no words horrible enough to describe the food.  The salsa was OK but the chips were covered in salt, the only flavor you could taste. I will never, ever eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Half a star wasn't an option.  Went today around lunch and regretted spending $50 for the food and service we received.  Our waitress didn't know what the hell she was doing,  she made little things awkward and complicated and didn't know the menu at all.  The best thing was the queso dip and I'll leave it at that. My husband couldn't finish his food because of the quality.  After hunting our waitress down for the check we had to get the host to find her so we could pay.  I am kicking myself for coming here and wasting $50 I could have spent at the grocery store to make a better meal.  If you like slow service and gross food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Yep. It's on the border. It's consistent, cheap Mexican. Had to order a low cal menu item because I'm fighting being a total fatty. Was very happy with the tasty chicken entree. I could also eat chips and salsa for days."}
{"text":"To even admit to serving tex-mex is the first clue about how bad the food is there.  And whoever that nit wit was that said Arizona has bad Mexican obviously knows nothing about Good Mex food.  Ill admit right from the start that I don't want authentic Mex. food.  Go on down to Nogales and get some authentic Mex. food Ha!  What I want is authentic valley of the sun sonoran style Mex. food the way its evolved for a hundred years from the early Mexican Legal Immigrants.  Ihave been all over the USA and true you can get some decent mex food in cal, new mex., west texas.  But to get the best Beans, enchiladas, red, green, chile, tamales tortillas you have to get it right here in AZ.  Here are a few great places.  Don Joses, Matador, Carolinas. Manuels, Some Burro, Juans, Ajo Als, Macayos.  The two best are Ricardos and Papagayos, oops,  They closed because the new management wrecked the food and drove away the faithful.  And thats THE TRUTH, from \"The Truth\" Ciau!"}
{"text":"Guacamole live is the real deal. The soft shell tacos were so so. Server was ok but the food runner was the man. He sings, always upbeat and more attentive than our server."}
{"text":"My love for On the Border is no more. The last time my sister and I ate dinner here together, we both ended up really sick the next day. It took a few months for me to brave going back, but one day, I had a craving for Southwest Chicken Tacos. I ordered them to-go after work and while they tasted fine (post grease drainage), I can't say that the meal made me want to go back anytime soon. Sigh."}
{"text":"The salad (Fajita Salad)  I usually get here is super delicious and a good clean choice when I am eating out. I usually bring my own dressing but when I forget they have some great options. My family seemed to like what they ordered and I heard no complaints :) Great choice for a family dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing service by Evelyn and Katie.   They are the best at the restaurant and always do everything they can to make sure everything is absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Great food. Wish the would open one in Greensboro NC Enjoy coming to charlotte to visit"}
{"text":"Have never had a good experience here. service ALWAYS slow. Came on busy and slow nights. Been to 3 different locations. Food is good, salsa is good. Only go becuase had gift cards. They really need to work on service. I'm a server and I know things happen but 3 different times it's been bad is no excuse."}
{"text":"As usual on the border delivered. Or food is always just the way we expect, and delicious. Prices are fair and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Had a great V day with my wife, we got there right at lunch rush and got right in, got a good table, AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME server, Michaela was as good as they come!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and the food was SO flavorful. We especially enjoyed the \"guacamole live\" appetizer! Our server, Ian was extremely patient and attentive. We will definitely share this experience and food with any and all we can."}
{"text":"Chain chain, go away, come again another day.  Chain chain, go away, come again another day.   Ok so, as far as chains go, this place is OKAY. Eh, yeah...okay. I've definitely had better. The salsa and chips they give you in the beginning are good. And that's a star right there. Free salsa and chips that are tasty are extremely important. Yum.   But then here comes the food. I got some kind of chicken fajita (FA JIYE-TA?!) that didn't have much flavor or zest to it despite being grilled chicken in onions. Try burger king style chicken among some chopped tomatoes and terrible guacamole. NO! NO! SAVE ME!   Granted, the stuff my sister got, the chicken enchiladas, were much better than what I ordered. That's either a signal that you shouldn't order from the healthy side of the menu (which I did) or you should have the taste buds of my sister. That's your choice.   Dessert was a saving grace, some kind of caramel chocolate empanadas with ice cream that really made the meal better. Well, it at least made me forget what I ate, until now."}
{"text":"First off we were sat right away. Very polite and friendly hostess. The server was so sweet. She waited on us and made sure we were taken care of. Great service!! Now the food is a slightly different story lol. While it all tasted good it definitely was not what we thought we had ordered. The beef brisket tacos are actually pulled pork like tacos that even come with BBQ sauce. Mind you without the sauce they're very good. Cold but good. We ordered the \"green pig\" quest dip. It's just melted orange cheese with a crap ton of tomatoes, chilies, and what was supposed to be chorizo was more like hamburger meat. It was not very good and definitely not worth the almost $8 for it. The chips and salsa is complimentary and very good. Not super chunky but nice kick. The watermelon margarita was divine (my husband ordered it) and said it was good and strong lol. The fajitas were lacking and had pulled pork like meat, 4 little strips of could be steak, a couple grilled shrimp and 4 little strips of grilled chicken. Not worth even half what we paid for it and won't order it again. All in all the service was superb and we will be back to try new things. Fingers crossed!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is GREAT! The staff is GREAT! We are here every week. Love the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. After 45 minutes all I got was a glass of water and placed an order. After 20 minutes after order was put in. I left only have a hour for lunch. Alot of people walking around but it only one waitress. I'm done here."}
{"text":"I love this OTB.  The staff is always friendly, the food is good, and the place is clean...even the bathrooms.  Good value for the money.  And the gentleman who serves the food and sings is always a treat!  He's a hoot!  Friendly, nice people make an establishment even better.  If someone wants \"real\" Mexico City food, then go to Mexico City!  For me, it's the OTB!!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant. The food is absolutely fantastic. I've never been disappointed with something I've ordered. Great service, friendly waiters, managers seem eager to please. They always have great deals going on and the environment is great."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I stopped in last night for a quick bite before our movie and were very happy with our experience.  We were told it would be about a 25 min wait, but we were seated in about 15mins.  We ended up only ordering apps and margaritas.  Our server, John, was super friendly, attentive and quick to bring our items and check on us often. The pear margarita was delicious!!!!  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I visit here every once in awhile when craving great Mexican food. I absolutely love their chicken flautas, chips and salsa and soups. Never had a bad service and never ate anything I didn't like. Definitely try their tortilla soup, it's one of the best things on the menu."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to correct a mistake for my friend's order, then the waitress comes over and drops it on the table and goes \"is it good THIS time?\" like it was our fault. Right. Additionally, the food aint even that great. No way Jose"}
{"text":"We were in the restaurant to celebrate early Mother's day before it gets too crowded. We have always loved 'On the border' for its food quality, but just like the other restaurants, understandably,  we have seen portion size decrease.  But we felt cheated for first time when we ordered Chicken and Vegetarian enchilada. Not only were the enchilada's not baked, it was hard to cut the corn tortilla, which had been merely grilled, with sauce poured on top.  We adked tge waitress, and she said that it was enchilada alright. :-("}
{"text":"We (my son and I) had never been here (in Las Vegas).  It would turn out to be the ABSOLUTE BEST PLACE we could have been.  This may be one of the longest reviews you have ever read, but I think it is worth it for this very special On the Border restaurant.  I believe that sometimes Las Vegas gets a bad reputation, but I think that is only because there are a lot of people who have yet to meet the REAL ANGELS who live among us here in Las Vegas.  My son and I have met many wonderful, caring and friendly people but today would be a Very Special Day for us (even though it did not seem like it could be with the way things had been going).    You see, today we met One of those Very Special ANGELS here at On the Border!!!  PIt seemed like things were not not going well despite our attempts to change that since we had started our early day.  My son wanted to throw in the towel (as the saying goes) but I, of course, refused.  He agreed to at least go have some chips and salsa and maybe share a tea.  We didn't have any money, just what was left on a one year old gift card.  We were seated right away with our menus and then a very nice young man appeared with delicious chips and savory salsa and asked what we would like to drink.  As embarrassing as it was, I explained to the young man that my son was having a bad day and was hungry but that I only had a very limited amount on a gift card and asked what my son could get for that amount.                    At first the young man gave us a couple of ideas and then asked if my son would prefer chicken or shredded beef tacos.  I asked for just one taco and my son's drink which, with 0tax, would max out the gift card.  The young man took the order and said he would get the order right out.  Then a female waitress came to our table, introduced herself and said she would be our waitress.  I thanked her for letting us know and informed her that the young man had already taken our order.  The next thing I knew, both my son and I had a beautiful plate each of two shredded beef tacos with rice and beans in front us!  This young man was really not our waiter (he, I believe worked in a different area in the restaurant).  He told us to please enjoy the meal and not worry about anything, that he had taken care of everything and if we needed anything to just ask him.  Both my son and I were in shock and very touched by this young man, this ANGEL!    The food was very good and all the staff  were very nice, but this young Angel was special and I only saw him once more before we left, and that was to give him the gift card, thank him emphatically for his huge heart and generosity and told him my son and I would be back to pay him back.  He just replied, with a very nice smile, \"Don't you worry about a thing.  It was a pleasure to meet you both and I will be here whenever you need me.\"  I want to applaud  On the Border for hiring all the wonderful staff they have there, the wonderful food they prepare and especially for having Angels in the business who provide a source of light and Good Will to others!!!! My son and I will be back.  Thank you again, our wonderful Angel!!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Food is always fantastic & service is great."}
{"text":"Food was good, as expected. Service was a bit slow, but good. Very friendly! We will be back. Great balue"}
{"text":"Vegetarian options are not that great. The quality of food can be improved. Also, the service was slow."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! I loved the unique atmosphere and the drinks were amazing!! Went with my family for my birthday and had the best night. Can't wait to go back for more. Jenai, our server, was incredible!"}
{"text":"We came here as a party of 2 on a Sunday evening. It was completely empty when we got there. By the time we left it was full. So from my experience, it looks like the place is pretty popular. I just can't figure out why.   The food came out pretty fast, which is a plus. However, the Mexican rice was grossly under cooked. It wasn't crunchy, it was still hard. The flavor wasn't bad, it just wasn't a pleasure to eat.  The refried beans were unusual. There was an odd smokey taste to it. It almost tasted like they took a can of baked beans and cooked them. I'm not really sure if I liked them or not.   With the dishes we ordered, I'd say the food was OK. Maybe I was spoiled by the Mexican food I would eat in Cali, but for some reason, I expected a place called \"on the border\" to be somewhat familiar to the great Mexican food I used to eat. It just wasn't. I was disappointed by that.   The true issue with this place is that the service is awful. When we were first seated our order was taken by someone who wasn't our server. She said that she's \"helping him out this evening.\" I'd understand that if the place was busy, but we were the only ones there at that point. I'm all for getting faster service, but how much help could he have actually needed?  While we were there a large party came in. (Party of 9). We were unfortunately, sat right next to them. The reason this was unfortunate because we actually had to witness what good service actually looks like, while being basically ignored ourselves. It's one thing to get bad service. At that point I just chalk it up to the servers being incapable, and don't go back. It's quite another to witness the same, exact servers giving amazing service to another group, while basically shunning you.  I'm not even exaggerating. I had an empty drink for almost ten minutes. Meanwhile there is a server sitting at the table with this large party, having a casual conversation. To get his attention I just start drinking the non-existent drink, which makes a sound anyone in the food industry should understand. The server actually looks up at me, smiles, and continued his conversation. He wasn't taking an order, nor was he helping them in any way. He was just talking.  A few minutes later the girl who was \"helping our server\" offered another drink. Our \"server\" only made an appearance twice. To actually bring the food, and to drop our ticket. When he actually dropped the ticket he told us to take it to the cashier when we were ready, and pointed to the front desk. We went there right away and we're told that the server handles that.   The manager said he'd take care of it and said our total was $50 more than the ticket actually was! I had to correct him as he walked away saying something about tips. That's pretty audacious to talk about tips with the experience we just had.  Finally some other server brought me the receipt back, and I left the lowest tip I've left in years.  Overall the food was decent, but the service was abysmal. If you want mediocre food and horrible service give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa is the only good thing about this place. Food is mediocre, service is below average. Which sucks because this place used to be decent."}
{"text":"If I could have given 1/2 a star, I would have - and that would have only been for the crappy waitress!  I know good Mexican/Tex-mex food - I lived in CA for most of my life where Mexican food is a daily staple; I come from a Mexican-American family as well. So, being a new resident of Charlotte NC & not knowing any of the restaurants locally, my family decided to try On The Border Restaurant because it was close to the other stores we needed to go to.     We arrived on a Friday about 4:45pm, and were seated within 5 minutes.  Waitress was devoid of any personality & Mexican food knowledge.  (That should have been a clue to get up & leave then.)  We ordered a sampler plate appetizer and some \"queso\".  Very disappointed with the lack of any flavor, except old fryer oil, in the steak nachos & taquitos & whatever else was on the plate-  the \"queso\" was just some Velveeta with canned chilies in it, microwaved until it became blubbery/rubbery!   Yuck!      Sadly, our dinner arrived shortly thereafter- another huge disappointment!  I ordered a Chile Relleno & Chicken Enchilada plate.  However, what i received was a very overly deep-fried greasy & cold brown thing - it may have been a Chile at one point - with cold hard Greasy Jack cheese inside.  I couldn't even take a bite .  The retried beans were very, very wrong, on every level!  They tasted like canned bbq beans that had been smashed & burned & then over salted!  The rice was disgusting - it tasted like oil/grease & old rice.  The chicken enchilada was equally disgusting & lacked any flavor other than old fryer oil.      My kids ordered quesadillas- they took one bite & said it was gross ( they wanted to go home & have me make the a real quesadilla!).   My husband was able to eat some of his meal, but had horrible indigestion later that evening.   I think the local Taco Bell has better \"Mexican\" food than this On The Border!   They should just probably change the name to \"On The Toilet\"! Never returning & sooo not recommending this place to anyone! Severely Disappointed !!! No bueno!! No Mas!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, staff was friendly but they messed up my food, I sent it back because it was cold and they replaced it like it was put in the microwave, I will only go to north lake now if I want on the border ."}
{"text":"As you can see I don't write a lot of reviews - I mostly just read them. I don't know if it's a crime to like a chain either, but this is a chain I definitely enjoy. The chips are huge, you have to break them in 2 or 3 pieces to make them manageable for a regular size mouth.. The salsa is excellent, I'd buy it to take home if I could.   I normally get the fajitas. The only fajitas I would not recommend is the fajitas that comes with every kind of meat, for whatever reason when I had this it came out look warm as opposed to sizzling hot. All their other fajitas are amazing.   If you like Tortilla soup then you must try On The Border's - Mexican food is my favorite cuisine and I've tried a lot of different places - On The Borders tortilla soup is the best I have ever had. I'm not even a huge soup fan and I absolutely love their tortilla soup (can't vouch for any other soups they serve)."}
{"text":"The now two times that I have been here, I have been EXTREMELY impressed. The first time, we got several alcoholic drinks that were pretty great (and big!), and the food was seriously delicious.   Tried it again a few days ago, and had the very same -- maybe even a BETTER experience. The waiter, (Robert?) was so friendly, and helpful, and patient -- even with some of our party's more picky/particular requests.   Both times here I believe I've gotten what's called the Del Rio (?) combo -- SO freakin good. Fish taco, enchilada.. the tortilla chips they bring at the beginning are even good, very lightly salted and the salsa is fantasstic.  Maybe this isn't a bona-fide Mexican place, but it certainly ranks way above your Taco Bells. The food is of excellent quality and tastes GREAT.  Highly recommended. I don't believe you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"One word for this place.... blech.  I'm not too proud to admit I've been here a few times (for some reason my husband used to like to go here...), and every time has been disappointing at best.  The service at this particular location is just AWFUL.  So awful, in fact, that we had a whole meal for three comped once after the food took over 45 minutes to arrive after ordering.  Then there's the issue of the really greasy, low-quality food that always leaves me with a tummy ache.  YUCK.  I honestly can't think of anything good to say about OTB.  Sorry."}
{"text":"We've been going to on the border for over 15 years and love Monterey ranch chicken fajitas. I just wish they would bring back the ultimate loaded queso. They will make it if we ask for it but we have to tell every waiter how it's made or else they bring us the wrong queso.  Overall I love the place and keep going back."}
{"text":"The food is the same as as the rest of the franchise.  The service is horrible, go to the concord mills restaurant.  They don't seem to care."}
{"text":"This is regular tex/mex spot weekly.   Chips, salsa, queso dip, tacos, fajitas, salads, etc it's all good.  Service is top notch."}
{"text":"Got the ultimate Fajitas. The stuff to add to the Fajitas is only enough to make one Fajitas. That sucks because they gave me 5 flour tortillas. That's not fair. The first fajitas was really good"}
{"text":"Going to be honest... We have had some pretty bad experiences mostly with the staff at this location but we always keep coming back because of the food.  We decided to stop in tonight for the Fajita's and we had a waitress by the name of Kaila. Kaila was by far the best waitress we have ever had at On The Border. In fact she is probably the best waitress we have ever had of any restaurant we have ever visited.   Our food was great and the drinks were never empty. Kaila was awesome and we will definitely ask for her next time we come in. Thanks."}
{"text":"I've tried eating On The Border many times at different locations and I was never impressed with the food. The drinks on the other hand are great!"}
{"text":"Cinco De Mayo is a very busy time at On The Border. Waited about half an hour (not complaining by any means as it could have been a lot longer). Levi was the waiter and he was amazing.  The food was amazing, the staff was kind and the place was clean.   Levi and On The Border I want to thank you very much for creating a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Arrived just before 5pm. Not many patrons at that time, we placed our order and waited, and waited for our meals. After about 20 mins. was told the order is coming up soon, another 5 mins. later and it  finally came. One dish was cold, and needed to be sent back, while I had the worst steak fajitas. The beef? had the softest texture to it like it had sat in water for 3 days, definitely not an enjoyable meal.  I had to eat my meal while the wife waited for hers to get re-heated.  All I can say is Adios \"On The Border\"  we're NEVER coming back !!!!!"}
{"text":"Go for lunch.   My folks live here, I live at Arribas. This place is delcious. Two item lunch combo and a tall drink makes for a great day with family and friends. Take your parents here, take a date here food is always cooked excellently, always busy, friendly, and great.   Never have had issues eating here. Sometimes take out would mess up which you just have to make sure when you go for pick up to double check, they are busy.   All and all the food is always good, I like the shredded beef tacos, the chicken chimichangas, Flautas, Dos XX or dare I say Margaritas in small punch bowels that will make you happy.   If you haven't tried swing by, if you have visit sometime."}
{"text":"We visited OTB with our family friends and had a blast! Our server graciously added extra chips to our table with the four hungry kids, always a plus for families!   We enjoyed several great dishes. Yes OTB is a chain and serves chain Mexican dishes. Their chips are always thin & crisp and the salsa has a small bite to it (depending on the jalapeño season). Of all the entrees we tried, we liked the pulled pork fajitas were the best. OTB has added several additions to their menu.   Our server, Lisa, took great care of us, good food and great company."}
{"text":"Good food, but inattentive service and disgusting fellow customers! We went late at night when the restaurant was fairly empty. While our server was friendly at first, she quickly disappeared, rarely to be seen again. Worse yet, while there were 30 empty tables in our section, with only a couple tables filled, they placed customers directly next to us. Why not space apart the customers a little, especially as they did not even have the same server? But, no, we had to listen to them LOUDLY discuss their SEX LIVES as we tried repeatedly to hunt down our server to get out of there. Despite enjoying the food, we won't be returning again. While they may not be able to control their clientele, they can certainly put a little distance between them when almost all the tables are empty."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for almost two years once a week or once every other week for happy hour.  Why? Because we love the $3 strawberry margaritas, chips and salsa, and the price of the appetizers.  We put up with the consistently bad service for the two years because we could both have a drink or two and eat for $20.   What makes the bad service? There can be 5 tables of people and you would think there were 30 occupied due to the the slow service.  When we asked for more chips, it would take forever.  Sometimes didn't get utensils without asking; the check would take forever after done with meal; I had to go to bar and get my own napkins instead of wait forever-just nominal things like that.--BUT EVERY VISIT.  There are plenty of servers walking around so I don't get it.  I even made a joke of it on Facebook when I checked in and gave the weekly service problem.  I sometimes felt the waitresses were doubling up as the cooks and couldn't serve full time.  I say I'm done----but feel I may go back for the loads of chips and salsa and the $3 margarita.  Meh."}
{"text":"The beer was cold and even though it was not happy hour only $3.00 for an 18oz goblet. The decor was very nice and the bar was spacious, but only a few patrons even though it was Thursday and the the football game was on.  The salsa was terrible: All I could taste was cumin and tomato. I added some lime juice and a few dashes from the store bought hot sauce located in the condiment basket and it was passable.  I had ordered the steak nachos, but luckily I saw a plate being delivered to another patron and immediatly asked to order something else. In my opinion... Nachos should be a heaping mess of tasty goodness without ryme or reason, not 14 chips spaced evenly around a plate with exact portions of steak, beans and cheese neatly applied and dressed with 3 jalapeno slices and a scoop of guac and a scoop of sour cream.   Instead, I ordered a combo plate: Fish taco, steak taco and a pork tamale with beans and rice.   The fish taco was surprisingly good: Deep fried fish, pico de gallo, some type of southwest sauce and cabbage, but I have had much better from several restaurants and trucks around Vegas for allot less.   The steak taco was a mixed deal: 5 slivers of steak, some type of southwest sauce and breaded and deep fried, but soggy, onion strings. I have never seen deep fried onion strings on a steak taco, but gave them a try... Disgusting. All I could taste was grease so I took them off and put them into my napkin, but then I had so much grease on my fingers I had to wave over the manager hiding behind a pillar to bring me more napkins. I asked for some pico de gallo, lime  and cabbage and the manager and waitress watched in wonder as I re-built and ate my taco... Decent taco: The steak was tasty, but there was barely any on the taco and I have had much better for allot less around town without having to make modifications for them to be edible.   The pork tamale looked like hot dog wrapped in a thin masa casing with a dark brown gravy on the top. I would say it looked and tasted like it came out of a frozen microwave dinner, but unfortunately that would be unfair to microwave dinners. At least the other stuff looked like it was edible!  I am not sure how you can say you are a Mexican restaurant and not have edible refried beans, but \"On the Border\" managed to do it. The beans tasted like smoked paprika, which overpowered the beans and ruined them. Beans are so easy even Taco Bell manages to not ruin them... Just saying!  The rice was surprisingly good: Buttery with just the right amount of what tasted like soy sauce. I ate them all, but was craving a fortune cookie after I finished.  Kind of wierd, but I was hungry.  In my opinion, \"On the Border\" is another chain restaurant that spent a ton of money on marketing and decor, but neglected to invest in their menu. The staff apparently knows the food is terrible, because they never ask, \"How is everything?\", but instead ask, \"Do you want anything else?\". The bar area is beautiful, but deserted, which is a shame, because there are only a handful of restaurants in the Centenial area and a ton of potential for a decent Mexican restaurant and Cantina to be successful."}
{"text":"First time in here service was great , chips and salsa very good. Had a cheese quesadilla and some cheese enchiladas food was pretty good.  Food was different then what I'm use too but was not bad at all."}
{"text":"The food took a little while to get to us but it was top notch and our server Morgan was one of the best I've ever seen and coming from an ex waiter that's one of the highest compliment I could pay and she handled everything very well."}
{"text":"food ok,great service and nice chips and salsa..loved avocodo fries..they have different menu for veggy ...plus point....can prefer this place many time"}
{"text":"We usually love this place, but this location sucks. The overall experience was awful. We get there and they sit us at a dirty table. The guy apologizes and proceeds to wipe off the table all on to our laps. There was rice evrywhere. The were not busy maybe 5 other tables were occupied. There was plenty of waiters. They didnt seem busy, but just kept walking past us. They never even acknowledged us or brought out the chips and water. We ended up walking out 20 mins later. They didn't even notice."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this really is as good as it gets. We live in North Las Vegas and drive down every single week for Taco Tuesdays in the Cantina Bar. $1.25 tacos..and they are AMAZING! Every server we've met is just wonderfully helpful and sweet. The manager is very nice and eager to help if there's any problems. It's well worth the 20 min drive."}
{"text":"We had these two young guys that seemed to be competing to take care of us, what a fun and great experience.  Cody and Marcus keep up the cool attitude and you probably deserve a raise..."}
{"text":"The food was good.  Not the best and I certainly expected more than three shrimp in something called 'Ultimate', but good enough to go back again if that were the only consideration.  The service was some of the worst I've ever seen.  After waiting outside on the patio with three kids for fifteen minutes, I was forced to go inside and find two menus.  After another ten minutes I went in again and asked the bartender, who'd been outside several times, if I needed to order through her.  She said that she would let our server know someone was outside. (like it was possible to hide three kids and two adults).    Our server was nice enough but no where near attentive.  We (4/5 of us) sat for some time with empty drinks.  We had to flag him down only to wait another twenty minutes for a box and the check.    To be fair, they were busy, but that's no excuse to attend to the tables around us and not at least check in.    I probably won't go again.   (He's lucky my wife left the tip)"}
{"text":"The service was very good. The chips and salsa were ok, but not as good as Macayo's. Ordered a Taco Salad and there were so many jalapenos in it that I gave up trying to fish them out and could not eat the salad. There was a very small amount of ground beef on top. The small amount of lettuce was not very fresh and it was served on a flat plate with a couple tortilla chips on the side. I gave half my salad to my husband and he agreed it was inedible. The SOPAPILLAS were very good. I heard the fish tacos were good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a disgrace to Mexican food. The cheese sauce is definitely right out of a jar and the chicken is 100% frozen chicken that you buy already in strips at the grocery store. Whatever you do, run far away from this place if you want any sort of a decent meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great lunch with a friend. Food was delicious and service was very attentive. It was quite pleasant to have the manager come over and greet us. We were seated promptly. My friend is from Buffalo, NY. He was quite impressed with the experience."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious you just have to know what to order. I recommend the asada tacos. People complain that the restaurant is slow but in reality you just have to know when to come. Mon-Friday it usually gets busy after 6. I went at 5pm last week and I had a nice booth my food came quick and my server was very nice. Around 6:15 this place got packed in the matter of minutes. Well the margaritas here are great. Very fair price. The coronarita is also very good it's a margarita w/corona beer. My very favorite thing about this place is definitely the chips and salsa. My mouth waters looking at it. Haha it's spicy but won't burn your mouth. I also love coming on Mondays the fajitas are half off."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant, food okay. We went on a Monday evening so you'd assume they didn't have too busy a day, if there's any excuse. Trash and food pieces all over the floors, tables not cleared and bathrooms had paper towels on the floors. The food was okay (beer was flat) but unfortunately the food quality was overshadowed by the dirtiness of the restaurant. There are better local Mexican food places that are cleaner, probably cheaper and better service."}
{"text":"Terrible food with lousy sevice.   It all started with cold chips and salsa that tasted like they had dumped a salt shaker in it so didn't have chips and salsa a staple in any mexican tex/mex restaurant.  Then I ordered port street tacos ....they were awful as were the beans and rice. The avocado slice was slightly brown and the slice of lime looked like someone had taken a bite out of it.  There was NO flavor in anything and I mentioned that my napkin tasted better than the food .... the waitress ( or at least that was her title) must have heard me and told management because a guy comes to the table and asks how everything was so I  told him !! He just replied OH...I also told him we would NEVER be back and he replied OH again.  Had I not been in the middle of moving and starving I would have left and gone to Panda Express right next door !!!  Trust me ....Taco Bell would have been much better !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. The price for a Fajitas For Two is crap and the same portion  size as you would get for one but double the price tag for $28.00. Over all I was very upset for a first time visit and will not be back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat ever! They have excellent fajitas, delicious margs and great chips and salsa. This is my go to Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"My daughter really wanted to eat here for lunch today.  We got queso and split a chimichanga. The queso was watery and had a metallic taste. We asked for guacamole instead, the guacamole had large (golf ball sized) chunks of avocado, but at least it was fresh. The chimichanga was alright. A food runner ( or a different server) placed hot food right in front of our baby, several times we moved the food but weren't able to grab the scalding hot side of runny sour cream (why is the sour cream scalding hot?) out of the way fast enough and my baby burned his hand pretty badly. I work is the service industry and I thought it was common sense not to put hot things in front of babies.  The manager came over and was very awkward,  he asked \"is he ok?\" and ran away pretty quickly. Our server, Nicholas was polite and professional and got us our bill quickly so we could get out of there. Next time we will go to Los dos molinos or even chipotle if we want decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"My recommendation at on the border is the Southwest Chicken Tacos. Their red chile sauce is fantastic! Restaurant has a nice, festive ambiance but our service here is always pretty slow, even when it's not too busy. Like many other reviews i've seen on here, we come mostly for the food."}
{"text":"Run the other way. Seriously. My boyfriend and I ate here almost a year ago and it still sticks in our mind as the worst place we've ate since moving to Charlotte. It's actually a comparison for other crappy restaurants (\"Yeah, it was bad. But at least it wasn't On the Border bad.\")  And the sad thing is, it's not that the place was disgusting or the service was terrible, it's that the food tasted that crappy.  The first thing we got was, of course, chips and salsa. I've never had chips and salsa I didn't like, until coming here. Seriously, how can you screw up chips and salsa? Then we got some guacamole, hoping it could alleviate the situation. I like guacamole, and my boyfriend's addicted to the stuff. The guacamole didn't even taste like avocados, frankly, it didn't have much of a taste at all.  I ordered the Dos XX fish tacos as my meal. I like fish tacos, I like Dos XX, this should be good right? NOPE!  After half a taco, I couldn't do it. The super fishy taste blended with way too much cabbage and some crappy sauce. The boyfriend got a steak burrito-his staple at any Mexican restaurant. A few bites later he looked at me and said, \"It's just not good.\" After staring awkwardly at each other and the food, we finally asked for the check. The server asked if we wanted to a to-go box. For probably the first time in my life, I declined. Because who was I kidding, this crap was unfit to consume.  The most surprising part: Beer didn't make it better. And beer makes everything better."}
{"text":"Came in over the weekend for an early dinner. We were seated quickly. Kate was our server and she was fantastic! Food came out quickly but was rather bland in my opinion. I can be picky about Mexican food though. I will likely return for the great service."}
{"text":"I was at On the border first visit and like very much everything we chose the ultimate fajita plate and Takiera our server was excellent help us get how we want our dish and always on top of aervice, making sure we have our drinks on.point also chips and salsa and that we felt like the only one in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the sizzling fajitas.  You must select the carnitas as your meat choice.  Then, top it off with an ice cold dos XX s beer in a frosted mug.  Also really good sangria swirl margaritas."}
{"text":"On my last visit, I had a hair in my salsa and stopped eating without disturbing the appetite of the large party I was with.  When my meal came I had another hair in my entree so I finally let everyone know.  I brought it to the managers attention and they said they would \"discount\" my meal.  Really???!!!!  I will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"Good food but very unconsistent based on the cook of the day. Also portions are based on the cook off the day!"}
{"text":"I do love On The Border, but at this location the host is not friendly at all, and some of the wait staff is clueless. I am from Texas, so I am picky about my Tex-Mex. This food is pretty good. The chips and salsa are definitely above average. All of the entrees I have had are very good, I've never had a problem with that. The past few times I have been, I've had the same waitress who works in the bar area and she is very friendly. Overall it's a good place with good food."}
{"text":"Not very good.  I had the salmon and the BBQ wasn't very good.  The veggies were supposed to be grilled but didn't appear to be.  My father had the ultimate fajita which included pulled pork.  We've never been to a Mexican restaurant that had that in it.  He was also disappointed with his food.  On the plus side the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I had the grilled fish tacos, eh. Not too impressed. The fish was kinda dry and there was barely any sauce with tons and tons of cabbage. However the rice and beans were very good and the cheese dip was off the chain. I think that if I maybe had gotten flour tortillas instead of corn, or the fried fish tacos it would have been better. Not my best OTB experience."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new. Came to On The Border. Went to the bar area for Happy Hour. Only seats available were the two at the end of the bar. The end seat had a huge gaming machine that doesn't move. Who in the hell has those? Finally a small booth opened up. We moved to that. Now we have a new server who is ignoring us... Finally the bartender took our order. Food is ok. Better than Arribas. Presentation was a lot better also. All in all everything was just ok. Don't think I'll be back tho."}
{"text":"Went to on the boarder for a quick happy hour.  Stuffed jalapeños were outstanding.  Server in the bar was so personable and fun, it made it for a fun.  Do not remember her name, but she was from Texas and made us feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and forgot to bring us salsa and the food came out cold and wrong. Beer was overpriced! Not very clean either!"}
{"text":"My husband wanted to take me here for my birthday, Sunday 10/8.  Arrived at what we thought was the tail end of lunch time, 1:00pm.  We were told approximately 15-20 minutes for a table for our party size (9). Didn't get seated until 2:00, on the patio. Chips brought to the table, but we were told they had no available ramekins for salsa. The chips and salsa are pretty much the only thing I like anymore at this place.  We had two kids under the age of 10 in our party, and their drinks were brought out in adult sizes cups, with no explanation as to why a kids cup wasn't offered.  One of our party ordered a margarita, and it took 15 minutes to bring him his drink.  In that time, we still had not gotten salsa, but one of our party had gone to the restroom and saw a table full of salsa ramekins. (Side note, he informed us that the men in our party shouldn't use the men's room as the handicap stall was covered in feces.) He grabbed a couple of ramekins on his way back to the table.  The waitress saw this and told him if he had been patient she would have brought us some.  We asked for a few more, and she brought back one additional salsa dish.  The food came and for most of us it was like warm at best. Another request for more salsa brought 2 more bowls, half full. Our check was brought out, with no question as to if we wanted dessert. No one had tipped them off that it was my birthday, and I am glad, since at that point I just wanted to leave.  Highly dissatisfied, sad to see what this place has become."}
{"text":"The food at On the Border is always wonderful. I just wish the service here was better. The waitress we had couldn't give 2 cents if we were there or not. We felt like we were an inconvenience to her. The rest of the crew just kept gathering up in a corner chatting away while we were waiting on refills and more food. After timing her, we had to wait 15 minutes on more water. Oh and let's not forget...their forks were SO dirty. Do they actually clean anything here? After a couple of drinks and tacos, we decided not to order anymore and leave. It's a pity. We'd love to come here more often, but the service makes my husband and I choose elsewhere. I really recommend the management to step it up or I see this place either getting shut down or the whole team get fired."}
{"text":"Well, let's break it down. Seated in bar......0 minutes Greeted......3 minutes Chips.......6 minutes Salsa.......10 minutes Order taken....20 minutes for appetizer only App arrives....30 minutes....and it was cold More salsa....33 minutes Asked for actual food order.....did not occur Napkins and silverware......did not occur Asked for refill of drink....50 minutes Arrival of Bill.....10 minutes after asking   Not a good trip.  Now I will say that I have had bowel movements more Mexican than the food here, but I do generally like this place....just not today."}
{"text":"Try to go every couple of weeks because it is my favorite Mexican food place but last night was especially good. Used the free coupon from val-pak and had the flank steak as my dish. It really is always a good consistent product."}
{"text":"Took the family for dinner here.  2 out of my 4 kids eat Mexican...had an American kids menu plus 2 Mexican dishes.  The kids even get a little sundae for dessert.   There was no wait at 5pm on a Saturday but at 6 pm it was busy.  I would recommend this place for Mexican.  Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Our server was brand new and made a few mistakes which was completely understandable. The real problem was the manager Shaun. He blatantly ignored our brand new server when she was asking for help. Then he finally had her retype our check because we had mentioned that it was wrong. He came back in and passed us the check and said \"there was only a 70 cents different\" so rudely like we should have sucked up 70 cents, but HE typed it in wrong again charging us all for the wrong meals. When we told him that we only ordered lunch specials, he said that he just typed in what the server told him. But if you already knew that there was miscommunication between us why wouldn't you help her? We went in and he messed up so he starts insulting us!? Seriously?! Literally the worst manager ever!!"}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. We haven't been to On the Border for many years since we don't live near one. Decided it was worth the drive since we got a Local Flavor voucher. Waitress was prompt in getting our drinks and taking our order. We ordered the trio (with chicken fajitas), two kids meals, and I ordered a fajita bowl. We specified several times that one of our daughter's meals could not have cheese as she is allergic. Even asked to make sure the beans did not get cheese sprinkled on it.   After that it went downhill. The food seemed to take awhile to come out. We had to wave down the waitress after awhile because our girls were hungry and we were out of chips (she had not checked on us after she took our order).  No plates, napkins or silverware have been brought to the table so we tried our best not to make a mess eating salsa and chips without napkins.  Our food finally comes out and is brought by someone from the kitchen. We noticed cheese on the taco and on the beans of our daughter's meal. Told the guy she could not eat cheese. He promptly took it back (no apologies from him or the waitress). The dish came back - no cheese on the taco, but still cheese on the beans. I didn't want to say anything else since we didn't want to have to wait for her dinner any longer. Asked the waitress for some napkins and utensils since she did not notice we didn't have any. We waited and watched her go to other tables after she left us, filled up drinks at one, took an order from another and disappeared into the kitchen. After what seemed like another eternity, she came with silverware and napkins for us. My husband and my dish required utensils to eat - it wasn't like we had tacos, etc. where we could use our hands. Would have been nice if she went straight to the kitchen to get our utensils so we could eat. Maybe it was the job of the hostess to have left us with some utensils and napkins?  My husband had ordered the trio which comes with soup, fajitas, and dessert. He realized when we got our meal that he never got his soup. We had to wave our waitress down for the soup. She made a comment that she had put the order in. She never came back to check on us after that.   We tried to wave her down several times but she did not see us. Finally got her attention and she was about to give us our bill (without bringing desserts for three out of the four meals that came with desserts). We asked if we could substitute one of the desserts for our girls since she could not have the ice cream that comes with the meal but possibly one sopapilla instead. She said she would have to ask and whoever she asked was kind enough to let us substitute the dessert for our daughter. We got our desserts and had to ask for water. She came back and filled only one cup of water when there were two set out for her at the edge of the table together for her to fill up (we didn't realize she only filled one until after she left)! She brought us our check again, we gave our credit card for payment and it seemed like forever again before we got the credit card receipt again. In and out in just under two hours, on a Sunday night and there were only a few tables besides ours (not at all busy). Our youngest commented she never wants to return since she had to wait so long. This is from a little girl that loves to go out and eat at restaurants."}
{"text":"We were excited to try out this Mexican cousine..Sorry,but had a bad experience for lunch.Very unorganized,late order serving and nothing like authentic Mexican food.I will never visit again. thanks"}
{"text":"We got a lot of food for our money. Service was good and the food was great. I would go here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We just got kicked out of on \"The Border\" by management for being loud.  The interesting fact is that we had no idea that there was a threshold for a noise level that the public had to adhere to at a bar. I guess maybe management care for my skin color. However if you are going to serve Margarita's you need to accept the fact that we Latin's enjoy a good time."}
{"text":"Being seated promptly is the only nice thing I can say about tonight's visit. Needless to say we left when after 20 minutes we could even get someone to take our drink order. We were seated and given chips and salsa and never saw a server again. I went to the hostess and asked if we could be seated elsewhere and she asked that we give her a moment. I went back to the table and waited with the rest of the party, still no server and no table change, so we got up to exit the establishment. Upon exiting we did let the hostess know we were leaving to which she responded I went to the back to find your server Eric, there was a miscommunication and he'll be right out. No thank you, we don't want to go back to wait on Eric we were already on our way out the front door."}
{"text":"One star for cleanliness and another for quick service.   The restaurant felt fake, trying too hard to be a Mexican restaurant with pop Spanish music. Please people, Mariachi is the music of authenticity. Uninspiring food that felt like I could do better at home. The salsa especially was so bland and tasteless.   I have to give it a thumbs down. Never will go back.  If you get my husband to say he experiences more joy eating from chipotle bowl than eating here then you don't earn the title Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped to get lunch.  I saw the more healthy menu and elected to try 2 of the healthy enchiladas.  One was spinach and one was chicken.  I had a difficult time finding the spinach. The sauce was incredibly awful. The waitress was terrific. She checked on me to ask how I liked the entree. I told I really didn't like it at all. She looked at the spinach enchilada and said,\"That is terrible.\"  She insisted on getting me something different. There was literally one tiny bite of spinach and the rest was just corn tortilla.  She ended up bringing me a taco salad.  It was OK.  What is interesting is I believe it was a manager that brought me my food and I asked him, what is this that I ordered? I opened up the enchilada and he had to see that my enchilada was just a corn tortilla.  He just kept on walking.  I won't stop in here again.  Again the waitress was terrific."}
{"text":"You're in Arizona what are you doing eating at a national Mexican Food chain. I did awhile back as I was given a gift card. If I were living in Idaho this place might be alright but there are so many far better choices in Arizona. The chips and salsa were ok but the plasti-cheese they use has to go. Does anyone think the ads for the Enchilada's look good?"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour, and had a great experience! The bartender was very attentive and funny too. And the guacamole was outstanding. That was the main reason we went there and I wasn't disappointed. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I would give this 0 stars if I could.   This was by far one of the worst meals I have eaten. From the rubber tasting queso to the fake sour cream sauce on the chimichanga, this food is inedible. There were four of us and we probably left the equivalent of three uneaten meals between us. The rice was hard and dry. The refried beans were tasteless. And everything was over seasoned with cumin. A frozen food meal would have been a better alternative.   The service staff was inexperienced and all appeared to be high school age. Very untrained.   Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"The waiter was very friendly, and the atmosphere was relaxing. .  The drinks and food were VERY good!! I forgot to review their online menu ( as I do not eat meat) to see if there were any veggie options, but the waiter was very quick to suggest The avocado and red pepper burrito, with a side of black re-fried beans.  This ended up being a fantastic choice..  The service was very prompt as well.  I would come back if given the choice.."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst meals I've had. The bathroom was backed up and all over the mats. That set the tone of my experience there"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Told to wait for 20 mins, instead we waited for 50mins. No apologies and server was slow and we haven't had anything on even till 9:30pm!!! Asked to talk with manager and no one ever showed up!!! Will never come back!!!  Checked in 8:15, now it is 9:35 and ordered 20mins ago"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why they don't have higher reviews here!?!? I come here a lot with my mother and we have never been disappointed when we are here! We come here quite a bit and order the same thing every time and they nail it perfectly!! I was extra impressed last time we were here because this one waitress we had was very attentive the food was very fresh and by time we were about to leave our waitress stops us to give us some to go drinks, now this just surprised me a lot because I've never had a place do that for me lol I know that sounds dumb to make a big deal over that but that was a cool gesture in my opinion!! I definitely recommend this place for some good fresh Mexican grub!!"}
{"text":"I had the dos xx tacos, they were great, outstanding rice and refried beans. My wife had the fajitas and said they were really good also"}
{"text":"Should have checked the reviews first, super lousy service here  Waitress brought  chips no salsa and no drink My food came and no drink.... Salad came with no dressing No one has been back to my table since my food got here...."}
{"text":"You're not going to read a review of a chain restaurant, if you're not the type to pick a safe chain restaurant, so I'll spare you the, \"this is pretty darn good for a chain restaurant\" speech.  Wink wink.  OTB is put together nicely.  It's warm and inviting and is decorated simple and appropriate.  While I wasn't expecting anything past bland American/Mexican food, I took the advice of one of my cohorts and ordered the Dos Equis Fish Tacos.  Deezam!  These fish tacos are amazing!  I'm certain I'd be amazed at the calorie count as well...but they are fried and dressed perfectly.  The only thing they miss, is bringing you some limes to squeeze over them.  Seriously good folks.  The portion is pretty large, three tacos...yes you can share these.  The service was pretty decent as well.  I'll come back again...but not when I need to lose a couple of inches.  Try:  The Dos Equis Fish Tacos (So worth it!)  Avoid:  Being boring...order something you haven't had."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy On The Border.  The Taco Tuesday promotion is fantastic!  We split an appetizer, have the $2 tacos, a margarita and dinner is done!  And, after asking & asking for years--they finally have FLAN!  It's good, too! The service is always fast & friendly, the food is REALLY good and always comes out hot and quickly. The promotions are a great bargain.  It doesn't get any better than sitting out on the patio and enjoying good food and drink!"}
{"text":"Me and my gf had the strawberry margaritas. They were really good and strong but it was just too sweet for me. I would suggest them but just know they are very sweet with sugar as the rim garnish.   For dinner I had the enchiladas with ground beef. I love enchi's but this place it a tex mex so no that they are not authentic Mexican style. I like the tex mex so I love these enchi's but for others they might be considered bland. But to each his own. Service was quick. Was there on a sat night and was super busy. Sat at bar thinking we had 45 min. Had table in 10 min though. I guess they realized who I was lol:-). Good food and drinks. Chips and salsa really good too. Couldn't stop munching."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fabulous dining experience ask for Tina. By far thee best service we've had in awhile! Tina made sure we had anything and everything we needed. We were upset that OTB was getting rid of the kahlua ice cream cake and Tina went out of her way to tell us the company that distributes the ice cream cake. Thank you Tina! We will be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"We love to come to this restaurant, but lately, it seems to be going downhill.  We ordered queso for our kids who love it and we right away noticed a new \"bowl\" that was much smaller than what they used to use.  No worries, we ordered our food and when it came out, I picked up my empanada and there was a long hair under it.  I was nice, when the waiter came back, I let him know that there was a hair.  He just rolled his eyes and said \"ok, would you like me to get you another one?\"  I said' \"yes, please.\"  He never apologized, just rolled his eyes (I felt like it was a normal finding to him).  To make matters worse, he came back to the table a couple of times and would say \"I am watching for your food and will bring it as soon as it comes up.\"  He did not put a rush on it and I assume he did not tell the a manager since no one ever came to check on us.  Even when he brought the check, he never apologized or acknowledged the hair or mistake.  It is really frustrating, On the Border was a great restaurant, I am not sure what has happened."}
{"text":"What can I say food was good portion size was good good more than what I was expecting the setting was okay the hostess was cool I recommend going there for a good burrito and Mexican food"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, staff is amazing, second visit and still happy here. Consistency is key to good business."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited for soft drinks and waited unusually long for the meal. Also ordered a side of sour cream. Ridiculously small. Overall food was average, bland chain Mexican food. Will not be back. Ever. Too many other fine Mexican restaurants in the area. Adios!"}
{"text":"Just left.   Ordered a 3 Sauce Chicken Burrito WITHOUT ONIONS AND PEPPERS.   Had 1.5 glasses of Coke and Chips.   20 minutes later I get my lunch prepared incorrectly.   I can't eat onions and peppers.   Paid $2.91 for the coke.   No free Soda when you lose 20 minutes and you can't wait an additional 20 minutes for the correct Burrito,  when they prepare your lunch incorrectly.   No manage apology.   Not real busy.  There might be a problem.   No reason to go back."}
{"text":"This place is almost better than some Mexican restaurants that I had in the past. The service is great and the food is not mouthwatering but tasty. One of my favorites there is the beans with rice which is somewhat Authentic (But then this place is Mexican-ish restaurant) and the quality is not as consistent when serving to other customers, but you must understand that some people have to rush to serve the food as quickly as possible without getting the customers mad and the quality must be at least decent. This place is good, but not yet great....yet. I recommend other people to come here if they crave for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Hmmm, not sure what happened. I used to be a big fan of this place. I've never been an overeater except when we go here. Use to be: Good food, great price, salsa always amazing. Now...not so much. Hubby & I normally share the ultimate fajitas, lots of meat, veggies, come out sizzling... not anymore. They seem to be skimping on the meat lately and the shrimp tastes frozen and overcooked. I've always loved their salsa, even stopping by occasionally to pick some up to have at home but the last 3 times we've been there the salsa is extremely hot, maybe more hot to cover up the lack of taste. Last night, our fajitas didn't even come out sizzling on the super hot plate thingy! :( Oh and the last few times we've gone in it has been crazy noisy! Between the music being so dang loud (inside & out) and the people with their out of control kids, you can't hear anything your family is saying!  Hubby, kids, & I are actually pretty bummed out. This was usually our go-to place and now it is not. Where to go now for good tex-mex food????  Dear OTB, Whatever you changed in your service and menu... please undo it!!!! How much money have you lost in the last year?? Thanks, The M's"}
{"text":"This place used to be great, but it fell terribly downhill. We first walked in and no one greeted us. Second our table was filthy which i understand if it busy. it wasnt. the menus were disgusting and had food in them. i wanted to wash my hands after looking at them. the waitress brought the wrong beer and the water cup was dirty needless to say we walked out and went to bj's"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and awesome food I Over the brunch on Sunday's and the pancakes are surprisingly good everyone should check this place out"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years. Late night was the final straw. The screwed up on my meal twice. Soda was bad also (no syrup). Service was soooo slow. Kids get deserts with there meals and we finally left after waiting forever to get them and went to McDonald's for ice cream. At least that didn't take forever to get it. Too many great Mexican restaurants in this town to chose from to mess with a mediocre one. Done and done."}
{"text":"Ewwwww..got pork tacos...or should i say salt tacos w.some porj! I rarely send foid back but i had to! Then the beans tasted rancid...the rice is from a microwaved plastic bag...i saw them uhh nuke it...they served all the adults and the kids had to wait 5 minutes..my parents took us to dinner and i would never go back again even if otgers were paying"}
{"text":"Ordered the three sauce fajita burrito. It was actually really good and you can taste the 3 sauces it's smothered in. Very gooey cheesy texture in every bite, but not super gooey like yogurt. There's enough solidity that you've gotta bite the cheese to release all that wonderful flavor.   Served with rice and beans, which were pretty standard. Nothing super special. Lime cilantro rice would've been amazing with the dish.   Good atmosphere. Can be crazy crowded on some nights. But overall, it was a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Really can't recommend this place at all.  The sides weren't served until asked for and took another 10 minutes.  Very slow kitchen.  Food very mediocre.  The manager was very apologetic and comped one of the entrees."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about On the Border in general, and this location in specific. Visited this location while in town for the NASCAR race, and was lucky enough to have Brianne as my server. She was friendly and attentive and made sure my vegetarian order was made just the way I had requested. The food was delicious as I've come to expect from On the Border, and I lost count of how many baskets of chips and salsa I went through. Brianne was happy to keep me well supplied with the chips and salsa, and I never had to ask her to refill my soda... luckily she said she was a soda lover too and understood how important it is to have a fresh cold soda refill on time! Keep up the good work and hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went to On the Border last week wanting to try something different than my usual order. I noticed the new Mahi Mahi tacos and thought I would give them a try. They were great! The fish is grilled and tender and the chipotle sauce has just enough kick. I finished my meal with the Apple Crisp dessert which was also terrific. I have been and will always be a huge fan of On the Border and my recent visit definitely confirmed that."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Taco Tuesday. BUT thats about it.  Chips and salsa yum!  $1.25 tacos awsome.  However I have yet to find something that isnt fried or \"heart attack on a plate\".  Of all the times Ive been there for dinner I have clearly forgotten that I didnt like it the last time.  Stickin to Taco Tuesdays only....The shredded beef ones are the best! :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here last night (7:45pm on a monday) for dinner and the hostess sighs as we walk through the door and the first thing she says is \"you can sit at the bar or there will be a wait because we only have 4 servers working tonight.\" ...wonderful greeting...  I look around and there were already several families waiting, and over half the restaurant was empty tables because they are severely understaffed and just not seating most of the restaurant. I asked what the wait for a table was and the hostess says \"I don't really know exactly...\" Just as her manager walks up and loudly whispers, \"just tell people 20 minutes.\"   When we decided that we would wait for a table the hostess hands us our buzzer and says, \"just let me know if you change your mind, and ill erase you from our list.\" As if to try and convince us not to stay. My fiancé and I just looked at each other, handed back the buzzer and left.    I have been here and the food was decent, but the service has always been horrible, and something tells me there is a reason they only have 4 people serving a half empty restaurant.    I'm not one to write a bad review either, actually I don't know that I've ever written a bad review, or any reviews for that matter.  This experience just irritated me enough to get back on yelp and let others know to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went to an On The Border in California and it was awesome! Gave this one a shot and it was not do good. Food was pretty good. A little over priced but good. Service was so slow! We waited 15 to be seated then 30 to get our food then 30 after we were done eating and waiting for the check! All in all food is good but service is terrible!"}
{"text":"The one star rating is solely cause of the extremely poor quality of food.    Being a vegetarian, every time I check out a new place, I scan the menu carefully for veg options. To my disappointment, the options were limited. Really limited! I'm well adjusted with a few vegetarian options at several places. However, at On The Border, it was difficult. The Chile sauce for the only two vegetarian Enchiladas was not veg! Thus, I had to go for Ranchera - the only sauce for vegetarians. That being said, I ordered Onion Cheese & Spinach Mushroom Enchiladas. They were stuffy, hard and had a weird taste.     Nonetheless, the real letdown was chips and salsa! I wouldn't claim to know authentic Mexican cuisine. Yet, I'll say this - a Mexican restaurant that cannot put amazing chips and salsa on the table is no good! The chips were thick, salty and partially uncooked.    Apart from this, the service was decent. Just mind your head on the booths with super low lamps. They hover on your head, literally!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sizzler. It came 30 min late and it was cold and undercooked. Horrible service. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend and they suggested we go to this restaurant for dinner.  I must say I really enjoyed the atmosphere and food.  The server was humorous, friendly and efficient.  Love the salsa!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided we had a hankering for Mexican food so we decided to stop at On The Border. It's not a restaurant we frequent, so we were unsure of the service and quality. We were very pleasantly surprised with the food and the attentiveness of our server, Lauren or Taylor (I can't remember her name for sure). I even used mobile Foursquare to check-in and received a Free Queso appetizer.  I tried the fried avocado for my entree which was ok, but overall the food and service proved a place we'd come back to again."}
{"text":"This was the WORST experience ever. First of all the waiter came out 30 minutes late then all my drinks or wrong. Then one meal came out 30 minutes after others. but most importantly there's a hair long black one in our beans and it made me lose our entire appetite so I am probably never coming here ever again"}
{"text":"Carne asada and beef chimi changa is my favorite in this. They serve free chips and salsa which is the best free chips i have ever tried."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time and it will be the last!! The food is disgusting. Our food was slightly warm. The refried beans tasted better from a can and who puts corn in Spanish rice!!"}
{"text":"I did not like this food. The chicken was not fresh and they used canned  Cheese.  I had a burrito. Took half home and decided it was not worth eating. Threw it away. Wasted my money"}
{"text":"I am an OTB patron for 20 years. This one kills my taste. management has failed in so many ways, there isn't enough space to write. 1/2 hr for apps, one hour for main the courses and not accommodating. How can staff be so poorly trained? No silverware, no plates and the food is not what you expect. It!s on the highway, but travelers keep away. Tonight you would have difficulty finding it as the sign and building are not illuminated.  Difficult to keep three kids happy in a disaster, you would expect to see a manager and perhaps an apology.  Plus, guacamole was not table side but a scoop plopped on a saucer. Queso fundido was not quest fundido but sour cheese - had to ask for the tortillas that should come with it. Totally dissatisfied with our visit."}
{"text":"Great food as always, but even better service! I'll be honest, we have not always had the best service here, but keep coming back for the yummy tex-mex. Last night, Oct. 17, 2014, we went out for dinner & had the best service I have ever had. Ashley C. Never let my glass get empty & was just the right amount of attentive without being over bearing.  Awesome service! Good food."}
{"text":"Thought we'd bring out of town friends to OTB. I guess they changed the menu, the food was marginal. We were a party of 6 and had to wait 20 minutes, for a Thursday night, I was surprised the wait was so long. And it wasn't busy, they scrambled for 20 minutes trying to figure out where to put us. The waiter did bring chips and salsa right away after we got our table, and did take our drink orders. Shortly later, our alcoholic drinks arrived, I guess the bar was backed up..? again, the place was dead..?  overall, we will probably never go back, there are way better choiced for mexican food. I was pretty disappointed.."}
{"text":"the best house margaritas in town!!!! huge nacho chips and salsa. great happy hour place."}
{"text":"We had the Best time for Dinner! Great Food, Awesome service, Fun time with Managers and Waitresses! Stacia was Excellent!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I enjoyed it. I did a choose your own combo, you can choose 2 or 3 items. I chose two. I got a chicken enchilada and a tostada, I think I'll try something different than the tostada next time.   It did take a while for our waitress to get around to refilling drinks and such, but I'll give her a break on that because it looked like she was waitressing the entire area where we were sitting with no help.   I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Far and away, the best salsa and guacamole chips in Vegas. They arrive at your table nice and warm, never stale and the wait staff never allows the bowl to reach bottom...just awesome!!!  Come for the chips, stick around for the Herradura margarita.  Great food 2.  Love OTB."}
{"text":"Went to this location a couple of weeks ago for my husband's birthday. I was pretty disappointed this time around. Usually OTB is pretty good. The waitress was a bit of a pain. When she was getting our drink orders I had asked what drink choices do they have since I could not find any listing in the menu. She proceeded to again- in a much ruder tone- ask again what are we going to be ordering. After that whole thing, it took forever to get our food back even though there was hardly anyone in the resturant at the time. Then she didn't ask any of us if we needed any refills seeing that 6 out of 11 of us had ran out of our sodas ages ago. Probably won't be going back to this location for quite awhile..."}
{"text":"I love otb back home and had the same experience here in Vegas. Kelly was an absolute treat as a server!"}
{"text":"Daniel was our server. I have been here so many times but this was the worst. Not sure if he is new? My plate was hotter then the food!  also, took 15 minutes to get a drink! Really?? And since when do you run out of Dos? I had to order a coors light"}
{"text":"Always have great service and wonderful food. We are there all the time! They have great specials! Ask for Kelly she is the best!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat just stopped in for an appetizer and drink. The service was outstanding in the bar. We happened to show up at happy hour and the prices were good. Enjoyed the margarita and a beer and all the chips in the world. What really made it a fun afternoon was the excellent server."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch yesterday at the On The Border located at Ray Rd and I10 freeway.  The food and margaritas were fantastic. But the best part of the experience was our waitress, Ashley. She was very personable and attentive. She is a real asset to this restaurant. When you go, ask for Ashley."}
{"text":"I enjoy this chain. I know, I know... Why would you go to a Mexican chain in Phoenix?! I love Carolina's and the local restaurants, but it's my Sister's birthday and this is what she wanted."}
{"text":"Ok, so they have 3 stars. Inappropriate. Maybe the name is misleading in terms of the food. These guys have some stuff going for them and I'm a big fan. Give em a try. So glad I didn't pay attention to the 3 stars."}
{"text":"The menu is smaller and the chicken and veggies have suffered- they are obviously skimping to make more money. The flavors are actually pretty good but the place always looks filthy (don't sit by the bar with a view of the kitchen) and most of the staff looks mengy like they just finished all night benders and haven't showered (sounds mean but it's true)..sat by the bar and saw one waitress with a super long pony tail  flopping it all over the place.  Bleh. Sorry."}
{"text":"EXCITED ABOUT EATING BY ERNIE HIERS This edition of Excited about Eating takes us not far from home to On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina in Concord.  According to the restaurant, \"Border-style means mesquite-grilled meat, fresh ingredients, hand-pressed tortillas, and sauces made in small batches.\"   Dora here. Definitely a kid friendly establishment. Visitors to their tortilla prep station at the back of the restaurant receive a ball of dough to take back to their table. Great strategy to entertain the kiddos.  I was looking forward to tasting the Grilled Mahi Tacos. A few minutes after ordering, though, the manager approached the table and informed us that they were out of Mahi. She apologized and offered the fried fish or salmon as a substitution. Salmon tacos? Hmmm. No thanks. I opted for the fried fish.   The fish was good, crispy on the outside. The cabbage and red chile sauce complemented without taking away from the flavor. I liked the crunch of cabbage over ordinary lettuce. I'm on a healthy kick, though, and would've preferred the grilled Mahi over the fried alternative, but appreciated their coupon for a bowl of queso for the inconvenience.  Dora here. Good thing they had my Brisket Tacos. I didn't have a Plan B. :)   Pretty, right? Just invites you to dig in. I don't know what's going on with hubby's plate, but they lost points for presentation.  My brisket was tender. The onion strings added a great textural element and the jalapeno in the BBQ sauce a little kick. The vegies were firm and colorful. Overall, I enjoyed the fresh, vibrant vibe, and I didn't leave stuffed like some Mexican restaurants. Maybe that's because hubby sampled one of my tacos? :)  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.

{"text":"In general, overpriced and underwhelming: I was excited to try OTB, having heard decent things about it from others, plus I had a $25 gift certificate so I figured it would be a pretty cheap dinner.   About 30 minutes before we got there, there was an ad on TV for their \"endless enchiladas\" so we figured it would be a good day for our first try.  When we arrived, we were seated pretty much right away.  My children were given a page from a coloring book with two crayons each.  Unfortunately, my daughter received a gray crayon and a white crayon, impossible to color with.  We asked for other crayons but, no go, so she complained about that through most of the meal.    Our waitress came up and apologized, letting us know she was the only one working that day.  She was the only great thing about our experience, as she must have been working her tail off, and still managed to be relatively attentive and prompt.    We ordered two kids meals, the lunch portion of the fajitas, and I tried to order the endless enchiladas, but was told they were no longer running that special, even though the ads were still running.  I ordered the enchiladas combo plate for $1 more than the endless.  They gave us tons of chips and salsa, which was OK.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was spicy, but pretty watery.    When we got our food, it was pretty disappointing.  Very bland, chain-y, nothing thrilling, and not very pleasant textures.  The kids' nachos were just about 6 chips covered in melted cheese, no meat or anything at all to go with them.  The enchiladas didn't seem like they had real tortillas on them, more of a thinly rolled pasta texture.  The bill was the most disappointing part - it cost $7.50 plus tax/tip to get my son's kids meal, which consisted of a handful of chicken nuggets, some refried beans and a \"chocolate\" milk that was still white.  We paid about $50 for lunch portions of pretty bad food, and not even enough to have leftovers the next day.  Not at all worth it.  I won't be going back unless someone else is paying and really wants to go."}
{"text":"This is not real Mexican food. Taco Bell tasting tacos , boxed rice(least thats what it tastes like. ) . For the price you can get fast food that tastes better. won't be back........ 2 stars only because  the server was really good."}
{"text":"saturday night and it was the only place without a 30 min wait time around the centennial area. service was great and i wish i could say the same about the food. avocado fries sounded like a good idea so we tried it. dipping sauce was good but definitely ask to hold off on the seasoning which seemed like paprika. literally had to wipe it off to enjoy the dish. steak was supposed to be medium rare but served on a sizzling plate that by the time it got to me it was well done. no biggie the nice condiments kind of made up for it. the 30 min wait might be worth it next time but if I'm famished, i'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's funny that this place is named \"On the Border\" because it's right on the border of mediocre and actually bad food. Just in between there. Not offensive, just not actually good, either.  Lunch specials are priced right - $8.99 for two items or $9.99 for three. Portions are generous. Chips and salsa are underwhelming, and the salsa gives a slow burn that almost seems authentic (but again, not quite). I ordered Caesar salad, a tostada, and an enchilada.   The Caesar salad was BAD. Because this placed seemed like a weird Mexican version of Applebee's, I expected a very generic Caesar. Instead I got some weird, flavorless Caesar-flavored vinaigrette with wilted lettuce and no croutons. NOPE. I put it aside after a few bites and notably received no questions from the servers. Normally when you don't do more than touch something you order, a server displays some worry. \"Did you not enjoy that? Is something wrong? Is there anything I can do to fix it?\" I don't even care that they're not going to do anything, it's the gesture that counts.   Both the tostada and the enchilada were alright, but very flavorless and underwhelming - pouring salsa on them helped, but not much. The meat was either bad quality or incredibly poorly cooked (maybe even burned a little). Not into it. Beans and rice were fine but nothing special.  The one thing I will say that's positive about this place: they have a great interior designer. Whoever put together the decor in that place has a real eye for it. It's very nice looking and probably draws in way more customers than the food. They also have a huge flatscreen so you can watch the game while you eat your mediocre, bland food."}
{"text":"Came here cause I was craving nachos and they were amazing!! The happy hour is well worth it! Our server was training but he did a phenomenal job and management was super friendly! Found my new happy hour spot!"}
{"text":"One small step above taco bell. Terrible beans and rice.  Food is not authentic at all. Catered to snow birds and white people."}
{"text":"Ehh this place was just ok. Service was kinda slow. The salsa that comes with the chips is HOT! Food was mediocre. We wouldn't come back...only came here bc IKEA is across the street. We've been waiting for our server to take our check now for a good 21 minutes!!! It also didn't help that I got bit/stung by something while sitting outside on the patio that caused my foot to itch and burn something awful!!  Note to management: you may want to spray out on patio if you don't already..."}
{"text":"Omg! My first time trying this place and it was off the charts! Our server Mitchell was AMAZING, his service was A1! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good, appetizer, empanada, were good, but the main course, the daily special of endless enchiladas was terrible, canned mushrooms, beef ones tasted like hot dog chili, chicken wasn't consistent one bite would be hot and the next not have any flavor, am not coming back here"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars because the servers are nice!! The food is not worth the price. Been here about 4 times the last few years now and still not good. Don't ask why I keep coming back! I got tortilla soup the other day and does not taste like it used to. It tastes like watered down soup full of rice and chips. Plus the avocado that was in my soup had a tiny little fruit fly on it. Just Nasty!! I'm not one to complain and send my food back so I just dealt with it, put the avocado aside. Luckily it didn't touch the soup!! But the prices are too much for quality of food. Not good at all!  Okay well the chips and salsa are the best part!"}
{"text":"Oh boy. I have to update my previously GREAT review.  Dropped in for late lunch. The watermelon margarita was still yum, but for the soggy piece of watermelon garnish. Ordered the grilled mahi mahi fish tacos and...they arrived smelling like low tide. I picked up a piece of the fish with my fork and nibbled...OLD. Sent back. Re-ordered with a shredded chicken burrito and it was tiny little pieces in goopy red sauce with tasteless green sauce on top of a gummy burrito. Seriously, like a mouthful of sodium gravy. OMG. Back it went...and I was done. Staff was okay about it. Got the check and the waitress says \"My manager took off the two,\" I'm thinking..yeah, I'm not paying for anything I didn't eat! LOL.  Paid for my $8.59 margarita (which they had these drinks for $4 on a weekend last we stopped in and had them with the former fish tacos that were good and didn't smell) Got out of there and went to BJs to eat lunch.  Thinking I'm not arriving back here anytime soon.  Inconsistent food, consistent drinks with seriously fluctuating pricing."}
{"text":"Wanted to dine at Osaka Japanese Steakhouse but they were booked until 9 pm (it was 5:30 pm when we got there).  Decided to try On the Border since it was across the parking lot.  Waited about 15 minutes for a table.  Waiter was very nice and attentive all through the meal.  Chips were really salty but the salsa was good.  I ordered the carnitas burrito with beans and rice.  The appearance of the food was good but it was kind of salty for my taste.  Overall kind of average food."}
{"text":"One of the best chain restaurants around. I don't understand the poor reviews! Every time I visit, I'm pleased with the food, service, and prices. And today was no exception.  My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. I usually get the brisket tacos, which are fantastic. But I wanted to change it up, so I got the three-item lunch combo with chicken tortilla soup, a ground beef taco, and a mushroom and spinach enchilada. The spouse had the lunch-sized beef fajitas. Each came with a side of rice and beans, and unlimited chips and salsa (we only had one bowl). We had so much food that we both had leftovers. We also each had a grande house margarita, which was good -- not great -- and I had an icy cold goblet of Dos Equis amber. Yum!  My husband enjoyed his food, and my meal was good as well, although I'm pretty sure I will stick with the brisket tacos next time. As I said, I'm baffled by the poor reviews because the staff was great -- from the hostess, to our server, to the manager who stopped in to see how we were doing -- and the reasonably priced food was pretty tasty. I just wish there was an On the Border closer to my house. Or, then again, maybe I don't, because I'd probably be dropping a pretty penny in there for happy hour every week!  If you're in the mood for some Tex Mex, give On the Border a try. It's not like mama (or abuela, if you're lucky) used to make, but it's pretty good in a pinch."}
{"text":"First time ever going and I was beyond pleased. From the moment we walked in till we left was 40 mins. No wait time at all. Everything was quick and fast. Food was freshly made. Our waitress Avis did a great job. Was very attentive. 5 stars for food and service."}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious and the fajitas are phenomenal!  Great service (even when its busy), fresh tortillas, yummy salsa!  Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I sincerely appreciate that On The Border monitors customers opinions and responds to them. Very few do that! I really felt they took the time to understand my issues and were sincere in making every effort to improve. To me that is huge and worth a two star bump. Maybe I hit the restaurant at a bad time around 3PM. I did fail to mention that I thought their tortilla chips were the best, as close to perfect as you can get in my opinion. I look forward to the next trip to see if they are as good as I would hope they would be."}
{"text":"I saw on Google reviews, that out of 36, this restaurant received 3 stars, so I figured it was safe to try. we were seated immediately got drinks & chips within just a few min (chips were good & fresh-salsa was weird, had an extraordinary amount of cumin, but ok-spicy after half a bowl) our server greeted us &  gave us a few minutes to look over the menu, he didn't recommend anything or mention any specials, which was ok with me. I asked him how popular the fish tacos were, he stated that a lot of people order them-which, in retrospect I should have asked if people LIKED them??!! so we order the fried avocado appetizer & I ordered a cup of tortilla soup,   appetizer (fried avocado ) takes about ten minutes to get to us, but , alas, no soup. we finish the app & first basket of chips, twenty minutes goes by - NO SOUP, guess what?? entrees hit the table after 30 min elapsed....we ask the back waiter - wheres the soup??? his blank stare says it all - i tell him cancel the soup  I ordered the 3 fish tacos - my wife orders the fajita chicken salad, my son gets teh shredded beef burrito  to sum up - Son's burrito, ok ok, temp ok, but shredded beef had a not normal flavor, not bad, just weird  chicken fajita salad...platter was barely sizzling at arrival, but that's ok, chicken was very tasty, but the contents of the salad were pretty dismal in my opinion, and the dressing, im pretty sure was Ken's ranch, otherwise a lower quality ranch dressing  fish tacos - ** note to restaurant** A fish taco is supposed to be CRISPY, so taco items should be served on SIDE, if you put all the meaningless crap on the fish taco , IT MAKES IT SOGGY!!!!  server could see we were not enjoying meal but made no effort to even engage us to ask any questions  the restaurant was busy, but I could tell the servers, all of them, were relatively new, none of them looked like they had a clue. i saw our waiter forget things, from other tables, see the dumbfounded look on his face & watched him turn around to retrieve whatever it was he forgot at least 5 times in the course of our meal  there are so many good restaurants in this town, it makes this bold face crapheap of a food establishment, look like the dismal failure that it was wont be back, telling all my friends, STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Writing this review makes me kind of sad, because really, I enjoy On The Border. Their margaritas are huge, delicious, and cheap! Yay for happy hour! The one closest to me closed down due to health code violations (oops)! I figure the alcohol in the margaritas killed any sort of germs anyway... Ok, back to this review. Since the one near me closed, the restaurant on Power is the closest. I've been here twice, and both experiences have sucked royally! Not the food or drinks, mind you, but the service, the hostesses, and the management.  We called to see how late happy hour lasted--stated we understood how busy they were, but it's one simple question. Bitchy, short answer, and then they hung up on us. We go to eat anyway (because it's National Margarita Day) 45 minute wait, not including my 5 minutes of standing in front of the hostess stand without being acknowledged. Open seating in the bar you say? I took a look while waiting for friends--open table = yay! No chairs = boo. I mention this to the hostess, hoping there's a secret stash of chairs. Ignored. We talk to management about being hung up on and the snotty attitudes thus far--doesn't care! We gave our pager to someone else and left... Will NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"have been eating at this location for over 20 years.  The quality of food and service has continued to decline and tonight was no exception.  We waited 45 minutes for the food, had to wait an addtl 7 minutes for the side dishes/tortilla.  All of the food was cold, the service was slow and poor.  I filled our water glasses with a nearby pitcher 2 times.  There were only 5 tables with customers.  It was just so bad unfortunately it was the final nail in the coffin and we will not ever return."}
{"text":"good: i had a sangria swirl margarita.. luv it!!! tried a new item on menu, brisket quesadilla. WOW what a surprise.. very yummy!   also shared the sampler platter with friends, also very good. bad: asked for plates with the chips, took forever to get them. also the waiter only asked if i wanted another margarita but didnt once asked the people i was with if they need new drinks..kinda rude i thought. will i come back? yes i will. i luv this place. hopefully next time we will get better service."}
{"text":"Best bar in Centennial Hills, great beer and food specials. All day happy hour. Glad to to be a regular."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch so there wasn't any wait. The staff was friendly and attentive. We didn't have to flag down our waiter to place our order, which was nice.  As usual I ate too many chips and salsa but they are so good. The salsa was a bit hot but not enough to deter me from eating more   I ordered the lunch quesadilla with brisket and chicken tortilla soup. The brisket was delicious, moist and had lots of flavor.  The soup was excellent because it wasn't the creamy kind of tortilla soup but more brothy. Lots of chicken along with rice and cheese made this one of the best tortilla soups I've had. I really liked the tortilla strips on top too.  Hubby ordered the lunch chicken fajitas and he said that was good. The tortillas came out freshly made and piping hot!  The refried beans were some of the best I've ever had. They had a slightly smoky taste without the slick feel of typical refried beans. These actually have bits of bean.. yummy.  The rice was also good but since I ate too many chips, part of my quesadilla and soup and those delicious refried beans I simply tasted the rice.  Again, the service was great and not too intrusive yet attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"The service is where this restaurant suffers. We had a group of 8 that all arrived at different times. It took 10 minutes for the first ones to get seated even though the place was dead. Once the last of our group arrived our waitress didn't come back for another 15 minutes and then took our order. It took almost 30 minutes to get a pitcher of margaritas and food was another 45 minutes while the restaurant was still pretty quite (only a few other people in the bar area). Food was average but those who ordered endless enchiladas were never offered more and waitress wasn't around to ask. Nothing really worth going back for here."}
{"text":"Meh. Friday night at 7:00. They were busy. That makes sense. Would've made more sense to have more experienced staff working they night.   I was brought the wrong drink, my Del Rio combo was over salted to a near inedible degree.   I'll give two stars because my girl liked her tacos and my server tried hard, and what could I possibly expect from a giant chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great once in a while and they are open late. It was average service and prices. They have a few big screens if sports are your thing."}
{"text":"Not too sure what's going on with OTB these days. I used to order and receive hearty, platefuls of delicious Mexican food, but now, it seems that those days are gone. OTB was pretty bare when I went in with my mother today, so service shouldn't have been an issue, but it was. She ordered a chicken fajitas plate which had an insanely small amount of food on it, especially considering what we were paying. I ordered the Dos XX fish tavos which were plentiful, but different in taste compared to what they used to be, and not in a pleasant way. The refried beans on my plate were runny and the black beans that my mother ordered magically turned into refried beans by the time they hit our table. We were inside of OTB for about an hour and we were offered a refill on our iced teas ONCE. Our cups sat empty for quite some time. The one time someone did refill our drinks, it wasn't even our server. I don't think I'll be venturing back to OTB any time soon. Whatever you guys have changed... change it back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, and the Milagro margarita is superb. It's everything you could ask for in a chain restaurant, without the hassle of bad service or sub par food.   I've been to this location on 3 separate occasions and every experience has been exactly the same. Wait staff was attentive but not pesky, food was ordered and delivered to table within 20 mins of us sitting.   The margaritas particularly the Milagro which is not displayed on the menu is a fine choice it is made table side with Agave nectar."}
{"text":"First time coming here.  The salsa was delicious with just the right amount of spice.  The service was great and my food came out quickly and hot. The shrimp tacos were fresh and tasted good although they were kind of bland.  There was not authentic spices or seasoning on the tacos but they were still good.  Tasted like a healthy meal which I enjoyed. I use to work at a Spanish club so I know how authentic tacos taste.  Prob will only go back to try out their $2 and $3 Happy hour."}
{"text":"On The Border is probably my favorite full service Mexican restaurant. I realize it probably isn't the most authentic Mexican food, if at all, but I love it anyways!  One thing though is that they don't always give a lot of guacamole if you order that. You seem to get more if you order it the live way!   I was pleased with the restaurant decor. Its simple but nice and is one of the reasons I enjoy eating here! The food is all quite good!"}
{"text":"Great lunch.. Fresh Mexican grill with great sauces!  Wish there was one in Washington State!"}
{"text":"Live guacamole (YUMMMM), house margaritas are simply awesome. We really enjoy going to this place with friends and hanging out over a couple of drinks and tasty food choices on the menu.  For Vegetarians- their veg fajita,  avocado enchiladas(less cheesy) and spinach mushrooms  enchilada (more cheesey) are great among other things. Strictly vegetarians must ask for cilantro lime rice coz it does not have chicken stock and for black beans because the refried beans usually at all places including here have pork loin.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Shame on me for going to a chain Mexican restaurant in Arizona.   I must hang my head and sigh.   My defense? I was in the Ahwatukee area, I was SO SO hungry, and my friend really wanted a margarita. Then, she ended up not even ordering a margarita! Oh well.  I ordered the cheese and onion enchiladas (I was craving a grilled cheese sandwich, so cheese enchiladas sort of fit the bill). They were not very good. It tasted as if they pulled a corn tortilla from a package, put the cheese and onions inside, poured room temperature sauce on top, and put it in the microwave for a minute.   I hate paying for food at a restaurant when I could have made it better at home.  Don't go here.   Really."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write because I love on the border just not in Las Vegas.   I have been to this location a couple of times since we moved here and it's just terrible service, lukewarm food and bland at that. I have high expectations from the old on the border in Texas that I used to go to all the time and love.  Our waitress today I swear didn't hear anything that we said. Part of my order I wanted to go they brought it to the table, we requested salsa never got it, the fajitas weren't even steaming or sizzling when they got to the table. I had to have them redo it and there was no apology.  The chips, queso and salsa we're good,  but then again how can you screw that up?  We had to ask for drink refills and for extra napkins twice.  It has been a while since I've been there...they have new updated menus and several different cheese bowl options.   Not sure I will return to On the Border except for chips to go."}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel and ordered on-line.  The order was ready on time. I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga and it was very, very salty. The chimi also had halepeno peppers chopped up with the beef (impossible to pick out) and was very spicy.  The halepeno peppers were not mentioned in the description.  It was too salty and too spicy to eat.  My dinner of chips and salsa had to suffice."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We definitely we will not return. All of the food was spicy even though that wasn't indicated on their menu, ingredients weren't indicated on the menu, service was slow and all the staff was too busy talking and flirting to care about their guests. Waitress didn't even wait to hear our answers when asking how food was. I didn't even eat half of mine and my husband said you could tell I was not happy just by the look on my face."}
{"text":"When I was little, I went here for every birthday up until the age of 9. That's how much I loved It. After that birthday visit, they remodeled It, change the menu and had a completely new staff. This is when things went downhill. The tortillas went flat and didn't taste at all as good as what I remember. The service is really slow and the food hasn't impressed me as It did before all the major changes."}
{"text":"Building 1/2 empty n took 10 min to b seated, took over 45 min for food to get out, you can tell it sat under heat lamps too long, n the Margaritas were super weak. Theres a reason we never come here"}
{"text":"We eat here about every 18 months. We always remember why it's not in a more regular rotation by the time we're done. We sat on the patio and the table was dirty but had a bit more shade. Our server apologized and took care of it. He was very efficient and the best part of the experience. The food just isn't that good. Even my 13 year old felt it: his response when he saw my dish was \"Well that looks disappointing.\" The prices are high for what you get. Also not a fan of a giant goblet when you order the tall beer. There are so many places for this type of food that I would recommend you look around before you settle for the easy chain choice."}
{"text":"The food is normally quite good. However, we did learn today that Taco Tuesday is a rip off.  It would've been more cost efficient to order meals from the regular menu. Taco Tuesday is advertised as starting at $2. It should have actual prices for each taco"}
{"text":"Pretty good! The atmosphere is probably the best part- both inside and outside. The tacos are a solid choice, and the desserts are very good too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family and friends for dinner here last night.  Not a big fan of chains, so not sure what to expect.  Really enjoyed the xx beer battered tacos.  Came because we heard kids eat free with adult meal, and have to save a buck when we can.  Found out after getting here you needed a coupon.  Manager suggested we register for their \"Club Cantina\" offers online, but said we could work it out without the coupon.   We registered, but the coupon never came, but they still gave is the deal.   Have to love great customer service."}
{"text":"This is not Mexican food! The place was nice and clean and the service was good but I would only come back for social happy hour and NOT for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Pay close attention to your bill and if you use a credit card or gift card, make sure the actual charge matches what you signed for. An additional $8 was charged to our MC. Contacted Seth the manager who didn't seem to care about the inconvenience he caused me. He discovered the mistake and never called me to fix it. To me that's stealing. The food was good, service was ok but did not deserve a $13 tip ($5 cash and an  additional $8 on MC)  for a $30 bill."}
{"text":"I ordered cheese enchiladas, they brought me chicken, I told her I wanted cheese, they brought me chicken AGAIN, and I never have and never will come back. Don't think I need to say more....."}
{"text":"It's great for being a chain restaurant.  Food is good but not the freshest. They just started brunch at this location. Brunch is soooo worth it. Mexican food + breakfast = many smiles. They start at 10 am so it's not a early breakfast place. It's a little spendy for breakfast that's why only 4 stars.  I based the review on the fact it's a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The 1 star is strictly for the food I ordered while visiting this On The Border \"Mexican\" restaurant. I ordered the steak fajitas double refried beans no Spanish rice. I got my food and was instantly disappointed when my server placed it in front of me. The steak had no grill marks and looked sad af. Assembled my fajita using the measly portion of pico de Gallo, guacamole and sour cream that comes with the \"fajitas\" Took a bite and set it back down in my plate. I was waiting to get taken back from all the flavors I put in the flour tortilla but instead I got nothing. I don't think the meat was seasoned with salt even. It was so underwhelming and not worth the $17 and change they charge for it. I'll stick to my original place next time I'm craving fajitas"}
{"text":"The crew here tonight was amazing! We were seated quickly and efficiently. Our server came over and got our drink orders and we ordered some queso. There was a large table seated next to us and our server asked if we would mind if he got their orders before putting the drinks in. We were in no hurry so we obliged and he thanked us. As he was taking the other order, another person came to our table to help him out with the drinks so we wouldn't have to wait so long...amazing! Our server was genuine, warm, and inviting. He thanked us again for allowing him to take the other order. He checked in regularly and engaged with the kids.  The food was yummy, which is what we expect from On the Border. The endless beans and rice is a cool touch that I don't remember from previous visits. I also appreciated having my queso split into a smaller bowl for my son and keeping the bigger bowl 'border style' with a small kick!  The restaurant started to get busy before we left around 7 and I noticed a few people who had to wait for a table. The service was amazing, the food was yummy, and we made another memory!"}
{"text":"OTB is our go-to happy hour cantina. They have great happy hour deals, giant fishbowl margaritas for $4, good happy hour food (gotta love the nacho platter and $2 queso!), and the service is always good. They also have a reverse happy hour. The bartenders and crew work hard at this location and also at the Mesa location, while also still being fun to be around. For a chain mexican restaurant, they do it right."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, efficient service and the foot was to die for! Real authentic Mexican food. You're going to walk out of there full and happy."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I decided to have happy hour at OTB at the Concord Mills location.  I was kind of disappointed when we walked in and had to wait for a hostess to come to the front to greet and seat us considering it was not very busy.  But it's really not a big deal and we sat in the bar area for our food and drinks.  Things were going well until I found a bug - still alive and crawling - in my food.  I didn't want to create a scene so when our waiter came by, I let him know I found a \"buddy\" in my food.  He says \"oh no, that's not good\" and simply asks if I want a new plate.  Hmm.. No thanks, I think I will pass on whatever else comes out of that kitchen.  I get my check to find he had comped me $1 for that... No manager came by to check or apologize for the bug.  I completely lost my appetite and I don't think I will be returning for a long time.  Thanks for the added protein in my food but I'll pass and I was disgusted by the whole experience and reaction from the staff. :/"}
{"text":"Have been here twice on the second visit the guy remembered us...impressive! Great service and tasty food only complaint would be the salsa is to hot wish they had a milder option."}
{"text":"Gosh Dang It!  Been here a few times and even though I like the food,  the service...shall we say, just plain ole' sucks.  Been to this location for both lunch and dinner and found the attention to serving, severely lacking. Who's fault is that?  Is it the server? Is it the manager?  Is it corporate?  I don't know.  Honestly, it's not my problem, until a tortilla chip is sliding down my throat sideways and I have not a water or a margarita to help wash it down.  This is what occurred on my last visit.  The food is A-OK as are the drinks.  But if I can't order in a timely manner, what is the point!  Corporate fast food at it's absolute mediocre finest. That's all am I going to say about that."}
{"text":"I met a former student here for dinner this evening at 1830. We were quickly seated. The food came out in a timely manner. I had the chicken taco salad which was palatable but otherwise unremarkable. The noise level was such that it was almost impossible to carry on a meaningful conversation. Although friendly, the  server never refilled or my tea or asked if I wanted a refill."}
{"text":"First time we came here, we attempted to order fish tacos and they came back 20 minutes later to say they ran out of fish. They offered us shrimp tacos which we agreed to. When they brought out the shrimp tacos they were undercooked and the taco shells were broken. We spoke to a waiter who agreed that they were not cooked. A manager came and apologized, providing us with a gift card to give them a second chance. Well here we are, second time coming. We ordered guacamole live for an appetizer and after waiting 20 minutes we kindly asked the server if the guacamole was on its way. She said that she was very busy and unsure if she would have time to make it. She then comes back a little while later to make it and poured the entire salt serving in the guacamole. It was too salty to eat and when we mentioned it was way too salty they said our options were to add other ingredients or they could take it away. We opted for them to take it away. They also serve tables with family style rice and beans, which we did not receive until we asked and the waitress responded by saying \"you should have got it\". EVER SINCE THE NEW MANAGEMENT: menu has gotten smaller, food portion sizes have been cut in half, and prices have gone up. Not to mention service is poor. Skip on this place next time you want Mexico food! Plenty of other great places in this area."}
{"text":"This is a much better mexican place than the overall score would lead you to believe.    The service is pretty great.  No waiting to have your drinks refilled and always cheerful and pleasant staff.  The restaurant itself is clean and has a nice decor with the required Dos X most interesting man in the world cut out.  They have a nice patio  to eat,drink a beer or hang out.  The food here has always been better than I would expect from a chain mexican restaurant. They seem to do a much better job than the other chains in the area.  The salsa is a bit hotter than you would expect, which is always welcome, with some very good chips. The lunch combos offer a few non-meat choices with some excellent tostadas.

{"text":"The food is great but the service has been getting worse over the last year. We were here on a Saturday evening and there was a wait to be seated. The reason there was a wait is they didn't have enough waiters. They were only seating about 1/3 of the tables. The other third had dirty dishes on them and the other third was empty. This restaurant used to have excellent service and I'm disappointed in it lately. Our waiter was great but could only do so much."}
{"text":"Server had no enthusiasm, nor did anyone else walking around the joint. I ordered a beer, finished it before our food came out and was never asked if I wanted another.... We were there for over an hour. Food was fine everything else was just blah about that place."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some Mexican food than you've come to the right place.  The service was phenomenal. Mimi was our waitress and had drinks, salsa, and chips out so quick it was quite impressive.   The menu was very nice and had something for everyone.  I enjoyed the chicken fajitas.  They were so excellent and plentiful that I took home the rest.  They came to the table piping hot and had all the fixings.  Everyone else really enjoyed there meals too.  If your in the mood remember to stop by On The Border!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my sister's birthday with family. Food was great and Jordan is the best server.  Thanks for the 5 star service."}
{"text":"Not too bad, been here dozens of times before.   Got here at 12:30 on a Sunday, were seated immediately on the patio. First of all, I was somewhat embarrassed that I've been here so many times and never knew they served breakfast! I guess it's because I always came for dinner. (They stop serving breakfast at 2, in case you were wondering) Couldn't decide what to get on the lunch menu, so I resorted to breakfast. I had the Gringo Breakfast, which is a pretty basic breakfast plate. It was tasty, a little bit on the smaller side when it comes to portions.  The only reason I give it three stars instead of four is because the food took a long time to get out. I understand that things happen and there may be a million other tables, but it was pretty slow today and didn't seem like there was much going on. Our waitress, Michelle, was very friendly about it though, so not a big deal. Not too bad, I will for sure come back, as I always do."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I arrived after my friends did, they were telling me how bad the service was and how rude the waitress was. I had originally told them to meet me there for the $2 margaritas special that they were having. The waitress had told my friends that they didn't have any drink specials and then went around and told the table next to them all the drink specials they were offering. Smh. She allowed my friends to order $8 margaritas while knowing there were $2 margaritas special going on. And she only ever did anything for us if we waved her down. I asked for the check and she said ok, went to the table next to us and they had also asked for the check, a box and a refill. She left that table, came back and walked past our table and got everything the table after us had asked for. Looked at us, and walked away to take another tables order. I got fed up, estimated our total and left cash on the table and walked out. Smh. Wish her I knew her name. Black hair and bad eyebrows. Sorry but never coming here ever again."}
{"text":"I am a 72 year old Navy Veteran who has lived in the Valley for 20 years.  My wife's favorite restaurant had been the On the Border Mexican restaurant on Bell Rd which we used to frequent at least once a month back in the day. I had not been there for 10 years until this weekend, when I stopped in for a Veterans Day appreciation meal. I asked the young lady that waited on me for a military menu, when she asked for a military ID.  She went on to say, \"alot of people come in here lying about being a vet, just for a free meal.\"  I showed her my dog tags and my drivers license which clearly says VETERAN, but she said the photo didn't look like me. I really felt insulted. Granted that DL photo is 7 years old and I have aged quite a bit since that photo was taken.  What really got to me was when she told me to get a better ID.  I left, and since I live in the area, dug into my file and found my DD214.  When I returned I was given a different waitress, one that did take my order and preformed in a nicer manner.  The food was was OK, but I felt my honestly and integrity as a Veteran was questioned.  I'm sure my wife would have felt the same, since it was always her favorite restaurant, but she is no longer here."}
{"text":"This used to be our choice for tex-mex. The food was pretty dependable and so was the service. However, recently things have changed. The last 3 times we have been there the service has gone down hill in a big way. All 3 times our order was messed up and on one occasion they actually lost our order. We waited for over an hour before they came out and told us they couldn't find our order. That was the last straw.  I don't know if it is a change of management but we will not be going back. Too bad because it is really convenient."}
{"text":"Just got finished eating and the only words we have for this place and our server is: RIP OFF. Our server was a hispanic guy with black spikey hair. He asked us if we wanted guac and didn't even tell us it was $10. We get the bill and we were even charged for sour cream when it's SUPPOSED to come with the nachos. If you're gonna eat here, check your bill. Also, we won't be coming back nor recommending this place to anyone. His service and this place isn't worth your time or money. WORST FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE EVER."}
{"text":"Horrible visit.  Sat at the bar for 5 minutes before getting service.  I ordered 1 double ketl and tonic and 1 double ketl and cranberry and the bartender rang it up as four drinks so I paid $30 for two drinks! Wtf. There should've been a double button on the pos. But they obviously don't train their bartenders correctly.  And it definitely wasn't a 6 count pour for a double.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Now this review is only for the empanadas. I was craving them and ordered these on my way home. They have chicken or beef with cheese. One appetizer order has 5 and you can mix them i.e some chicken and some beef. The empanadas are fried ( I prefer the baked ones ) and come with a processed cheese sauce. The cheese sauce is terrible.  The chicken ones didn't taste like anything really, the beef ones were better. No spices really. They come with chips and salsa. The empanadas taste much better dipped in the salsa rather than the sauce they came in! Won't be having these again I tell ya, no matter how bad my craving!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here, at least not yet anyway. The salsa is always super yummy. Try the XX Equis fish tacos. Deeeeelish!"}
{"text":"Wow, visited Jan 16th for dinner and I would not recommend this place. I was From out of town meeting up with friends I haven't seen in a long time. I was embarrassed we met here.  The bathroom sink was falling apart, and the soap dispenser was broken and we had a wobbly booth so we moved to a table. We had no issues with the food But the service was horrible, slow and once we received our entrees we never saw the waiter again. He was around waiting on other tables but never stopped to see if we needed refills or anything else. We had 3 in the party and I had the enchiladas off the reg menu.  Will not return."}
{"text":"The service at this place is HORRIBLE and management is even worse. However, the server Tia was so sweet and attentive. She really lightened the experience. Thanks Tia!"}
{"text":"The food is OK, but what do you expect for a chain restaurant.  The enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! I love the house margaritas!! Great price for the food! I celebrated my bday here yesterday and great service too!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, they messed our order up. Waitress was slow and just an overall displeasing time."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of six, the last 2 times we came we had the same server and she left a lot to be desired. Tonight Christian was our server and he was friendly and attentive. The chips and fresh salsa are my favorite and the all the entrees I have ever ordered have been delicious. Overall this is my favorite sit down Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't really have anything positive to say about this place.  First the wait was 30 minutes which is to be expected on a Friday night but not when there are several empty tables in the dining room.  The service is also tremendously slow.  Took almost 15 minutes to get out drinks. Not to mention our appetizers never even came out. We got a \"I'm sorry I forgot to put them in\"  Finally after 40 minutes our meals arrived. Just to find out that the tacos I ordered came out ice cold. Not acceptable for the prices this place is tying to charge. On top of that the plate was not \"remade\" as promised. Simply thrown in the microwave. So when it came out the second time it was noticeably dryer and the tortillas were extremely soggy.  No apology. She just took our drinks off the check ..  So I will not be back. Simple as that."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Their sides are better than a lot of \"Mexican\" places. I only gave it three stars because it's close to several other Mexican restaurants all of which have much better drinks and drink specials. The atmosphere was nice but my husband hated all the tacky gazing orbs. They might've been xmas decorations, though. Everything was good and I know I'll go back, but only because I can walk there. Great service from everyone we interacted with and all of the staff were very thoughtful and informative.  UPDATE: I've upped the review a star since going back. Their $9.99 pick 3 combo really is a great deal. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Well-run Mexican chain restaurant. Attitude of employees goes a long way here. They act like they actually enjoy serving food and drink to customers. Who wants to have delicious food served by grumpsters. Our clan had a long wait at the bar and even though only one of us was having alcohol (me!), the bartenders were omnipresent and friendly, handing out bountiful baskets of chips with salsa and making cherry Cokes for the little one. Decor and seating were above average, with a roaring gas fireplace and interesting art on the walls. I think the menu is perfectly fine and a bit more inventive than local chains. Brisket and taco-stand tacos are standouts. The guacamole tasted like fresh avocados and the lager beer was fresh. I usually run far away from chains but when in this part of town there isn't much choice. I'd recommend this place unless you absolutely hate Tex-Mex food, in which case I feel sorry for ya, buddy."}
{"text":"Walked in around 8:30pm - 8:45pm with my family for a late dinner. Ahead of us were were a couple of 4 which found a table pretty quick cause the place was empty. Then we got a booth , here's the problem--- the place is empty and we can't get any service. No chips no salsa no drinks dirty table. I think the couple of 4 ahead of us were thinking the same thing because they got up and walked out and we followed. It's all good though went to Outback on Bell Rd spent 113.00 on dinner with a 30.00 tip. This isn't our first bad service here. ( WON'T BE COMING BACK) Management needs a wake up call. Check the cameras if you don't believe!"}
{"text":"On The Border saved my sanity (and someone's life).  That's right, folks.  You read it here first.  Picture it:  Charlotte in December.  It was a Friday night.  I got out of work, got stuck in ignorant holiday traffic, but finally made it home...about 30 minutes late.   Working a 2nd job and taking a night class, this was my one free night to relax and have a nice meal out.  I changed quickly and we were out the door, heading to PF Chang's.  Cut to: the power-tripping hostess who didn't want to seat our party of 5 at one of their empty tables.  (See PF Chang's review for details on that \"fun\" episode.)  We left and headed toward what we thought would be a slower part of town.  We got stuck in more ignorant holiday traffic and what should have been a 15 minute drive turned out to be about an hour.  It was really turning out to be a great night.  We finally reached a shopping plaza where there was a Macaroni Grille.  We decided to pull in.  An hour wait.  I ran next door to On The Border.  It, too, was supercrowded.  \"We can seat you right away,\" said the hostess.  Really?  Heck, yeah!  Mexican it is!   And we WERE seated right away.    The restaurant was supercrowded in the dining room, but somehow we lucked out.  Our cheerful server came immediately to our table, brought mucho chips and salsa, and took our drink orders.  After the way the evening had gone so far, mama needed some margarita.  The chips were gone in no time and we were immediately brought more.   With my Enchiladas Suizas (chicken and cheese enchiladas covered with green, sweet tomatillo sauce) came Margarita #2.  We were SO pleased with the food and service that we left a nice, fat tip.  Happy holidays to him!  After this exceptional experience, you may be asking yourself, \"Why did he only give On The Border four stars instead of five?\"  And my answer would be because I consider Cantina 1511 a five-star Mexican restaurant and On The Border a four-star.  On The Border's salsa and entree options can't compare to Cantina's gourmet take on Mexican.   They're good...but they're no Cantina.    So now you see why On The Border saved my sanity (and possibly someone's life).  The End."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times and when the team is on point it's wonderful but the problem is they are not always wonderful. Most servers are polite but not very enthusiastic. The real gripe though is the kitchen staff. Some times the food comes out fresh and hot, delicious; on a good day the fajita chicken quesadilla is my favorite. Other times the same quesadilla comes out luke warm with barely any chicken in it. When they're good they're good, but for the price there are better, more consistently delicious places to frequent."}
{"text":"We really like the food.  The young hostess staff seem preoccupied with checking their phones and talking to each other vs. welcoming and thanking the guests.  We will keep going there for the food but never feel welcome."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, food was decent, price is a bit much for the quality of the food and service was not good.   Our server was awkward, he never filled our waters, when we asked, he took awhile to come back with more water but he only gave us 1 water, not everyone else :( all the cups were empty. The queso was good though! We did the free queso if you joined their text club for deals. Server forgot to compt the queso at the end.  There was a sweet lady who brought us the food and asked if we needed anything, I asked for sauce and jalapeños and she was so quick and those raw jalapeños were hot :) went will with my burrito. But when I originally ordered I had asked for those jalapeños but what the server ended up writing and translated into me getting my burrito with some cooked bell peppers on top haha others ordered the same thing without the pepper and just got the burrito itself so that was weird but hey it was pretty tasty, probably miscommunication. Our server was awkward, I mean super awkward!  When we asked for the bill he took my card and left for over 10 minutes. I honestly was in a serious food coma and needed to get home and Netflix, you know? But I started to worry if my server was okay, is my card ok? What's he doin? It wasn't that busy and I saw a lot of employees hangin around. Anyways he finally comes by and gives me my card back and runs off. I wanted to tell him thanks for the service but didn't get a chance.   By the way, I saw a lady making fresh tortilla at the back and that was awesome. Reminds me of being back in Mexico ordering tacos from the stand :)  I finally left and KO'ed from major food coma.  Thanks y'all! Hopefully my next experience is much better next time. I believe in you guys!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the new cactus margaritas!  So good. The Monterey chicken ranch fajitas were well worth the visit.  Grilled chicken breast with carmelized onions and smothered in Monterey Jack cheese and bacon.  The server was perfect!  The only complaint that I had is that the cheese dip is not free anymore. You still get free chips and salsa, though!"}
{"text":"The brisket tacos are delicious.  The meat is cooked just right!   The ranch, bacon and chicken fajitas are what I had last time and are probably my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I give Five stars because they have a great \"happy hour\". Starts at 3pm! I've never eaten a meal here, but I would and I think it would be pretty good."}
{"text":"I love the steak fajitas here! It is what I get every time. I just found out today that fajitas are 1/2 price on Monday! OtB is as close to Tex Mex food as you're gonna get in Las Vegas. The queso was also pretty delicious. I drive here from Henderson to get my fix."}
{"text":"Worst service I have received in a long time!  Food was cold and incorrect.  Was really looking forward to dinner out at On The Boarder, but was left extremely disappointed in the food and service. We will NOT be back anytime soon. Gave one star but would have given 1/2 a star if I could."}
{"text":"My parent's love this place. We attend taco Tuesday every week. Jose is our waiter every Tuesday and the manager is super kind. Everyone is upbeat and kind. Our food comes out hot and fresh. Everything is prepared as we ordered. The best thing is Jose remembers every time what my parents drink and what their orders are for Taco Tuesday since they order the same thing every Tuesday. Even the bartender knows where my parents need to sit due to my mother's walker. The service is impeccable and our cups stay filled. The place is always clean. Jose is always upbeat and kind!"}
{"text":"Very good food!  My wife ordered a chicken taco that had onion strings in it,  I forget the name of the dish,  but it was very good.  I had the standard chicken taco, it was quite good.  I'd like to come back and try some dishes."}
{"text":"I DIDN'T WHAT TO GIVE IT A STAR BUT IT WAS A MUST.... We went here on Saturday 10/07/15 for dinner. Sorry to say we're not happy at all. There was six of us. We ordered our dinner and waited for about 20 minutes. The waitress asked if you wanted anything to drink .  So my husband got  margarita  with the melted  shot or whatever its called .  Anyways  when the waitress finally came  to give us our drink  she spilt  the liquor  and got all over my husband shoes  and my husband's pant leg . We didn't realize it until we left because it was dark in there. Finally they asked us if  we wanted chips and salsa. 20 more minutes came and we finished the chips  and salsa. She never came to check on us if we needed anything else or refills. When our food got there they forgot about my son's food and had to wait a little longer. Well when I got my food I ordered the ultimate fajita and it tasted like metal and the rice tasted sour and I ordered black beans  but instead I got refried beans .The service was just so horrible that we just wanted to leave. When we got home my kids complained to me that their stomach was hurting and I started throwing up. I will never come back here again first of all the people there were rude giving my family and I weird looks because to me it felt like they are being racist."}
{"text":"Omg, although the food was good, once I was home for a few hours I got so incredibly sick and Ill. It hit me all at once and was terribly painful. I'll spare you the horrific details but I hope I never have to have all these symptoms combined at once again. I was in tears.  We called the restaurant manager who said he was \"sorry but it wasn't food poisoning because that doesn't come on until 12 hours after eating the bad food\". I was sick and in the bathroom but I have a medical background and anyone with a brain in their head or access to flippen google knows this couldn't be further from the truth.  So, Dr. On The Border at Arrowhead has lost 2 families as customers and he didn't try anything to try and change our experience. I will be making a proper formal complaint on Monday to the state so that this can be looked into further and hopefully no one else will experience food poisoning from On The Border at The Arrowhead Bell Road location."}
{"text":"I went back a couple of weeks with my sister I had the fajitas the food was excellent the server was great , over all our experience was awesome this time around ..."}
{"text":"0 stars!  I ordered the brisket quesidillas and suffered 36 hours of horrific food poisoning after. All they did was refund my $11 bill and give me coupons to come back again. NEVER!"}
{"text":"**updated review** decided it's been a while since we've tried this location since the last two horrible visits** today when we came in we were seated immediately, but had no waiter for 15 mins. Once they finally came to our table we got drinks, apps & meals, they had an endless enchiladas special for $10 so my friend and I tried it the other two with us got regular menu items. When it came time to check out the manager on staff Luis made the call that they would not apply my active duty friends military discount to her regular priced menu item, even though the endless enchiladas were a deal on a separate check. However the excuse Luis gave us was we sat at the same table. How patriotic. I will urge other military members to avoid this location. Never at any other location have they ever told a member serving their country no you can't have your discount because your friend on another check got a special. The only good things about this visit was our fantastic waiter Christian A. who once assigned to our table was phenomenal and the food quality has gone up significantly since it last visit. But I highly urge ownership to look into their unsympathetic unpatriotic monotone management.    **old review** So I received a second opportunity from ownership to come give this location another try, and I didn't think it was possible but the service managed to become even worse as well as the food. When we walked in the door there was a line and no hostess. The first family had been waiting before us and by the time someone seated them and then us about 10 minutes had passed. The server we had was less than enthusiastic and didn't greet us or get a drink order in until we had been siting for over (again) 10 minuets and three different people had seen us. For a Friday night it was a ghost town, and so was their Cantina. I brought two other couples with us for a group date night and they would all agree with what I am saying. The chips and salsa were fine but the chips some how managed to have no salt on them and it had all been piled up on the bottom of the bowl, and we constantly had to ask for more salsa they gave a table of six people 4 cups of it and two of those people being from Texas... personally speaking we love our salsa. We also had to ask for our own drink refills which having been a server myself is unacceptable. I got a create my own dinner with 3 kinds of enchiladas. The cheese enchilada was so hard I couldn't even cut it with my knife that was sharp enough to cut through meat easily and the onions were invisible to my tongue. The Chicken Tinga enchilada was so mushy and watery I didn't even know it was chicken until I opened it up to check it. The spinach mushroom enchilada was good on the spinach but lacking int he mushroom department. The sauces on all three of the enchiladas were good though. The black beans were so cold that the cheese they put on top never melted. and the rice was yummy minus the very, very dry corn in it. At least he got the order right the kitchen just didn't do what they are paid to do apparently. When it came time to check out I was shocked at what came out of his mouth next... If we split our check to the three couples he couldn't do the military discount. BUT if we kept it in one check he would. Having been in the business myself I know how much of a pain splitting checks are but seriously?? These men that are with us don't want to have one guy pay for everyone, let alone they deserve to each have the discount just for serving our country. I was completely amazed and offended for them. On top of that I had the email for a buy one get one up to $10 for labor day weekend that the server forgot about. The only decent experience was the manager working this shift. She stepped up and fixed my check then added the discount for the Military onto all of our checks which she said she wasn't suppose to do. I love OTB but needless to say I will not be going to this one again anytime soon since this was suppose to be their second chance for us to try them out per- owners. When I lived in Texas I went 4-6 times a month and this establishment is an embarrassment as to what On the Border's standards are. They need new staff. And their 21 year old rule for the cantina is losing them money still, when they desperately need the business having been almost completely empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I can only review the margaritas because that's all I had here besides the chips and salsa. The strawberry margarita with a coronita upside down in it was delicious and strong. It was a pretty big margarita, too. The chips and salsa were on point and complemented the margaritas really well. The bartender and server were so awesome and friendly."}
{"text":"Disgusting...  There is nothing Mexican about this place. It's an overpriced Taco Bell. This was topped off by loud pre teen pop music!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  The service, is another thing all together.  I've never had rude service here, just very slow and indifferent service.  Tonight, for example, my friend ordered a chimichanga with carne asada, but received something else.  We aren't actually sure what was in the chimi he received, but it wasn't carne asada.    Additionally, every single time we go there, no matter the time of day or how busy it is, we wait a long time to be seated, to get our drink orders taken, and getting drink refills is unlikely most of the time.  The manager passed our table at least twice and didn't notice our empty glasses and craning necks looking for our waitress.  We would be regulars if the service wasn't so awful.  The food is very good but not good enough to endure the terrible service more than a couple times a year.  Maybe that's how they stay in business?"}
{"text":"Long wait, but great service, friendly staff and good food. Huge chips and tasty salsa,  too full for dessert. I got the Ranch chkn fajitas, which were good, but next time, I'm getting the Brisket soft tacos! Delish. Tea glass was never empty which is always a plus with chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. Its hard to disappoint me when I know I'm going to eat this food. Yet this place did find many other ways to make that happen. First the host placed me and my wife at a booth that would fit 8 people. The window was facing the afternoon sun and she never asked to lower the blinds. After a few minutes of sitting in the direct sun and starting to sweat, I asked we could be moved. She asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. \" No, please just seat us at another table or booth\".  She did as I asked. Even though the table she took us to was clean on top, you could have filled a waste basket with the food and chips that where under it. She grabbed a broom and did sweep it out. So I started to look around. The place was a complete mess. Tables with plates and food still on them and the floor was a complete disaster. Ok, lets just eat I told my wife. The waitress ask for our drink order. Great time for a margarita. Not really. Time for a lot of sweet and sour. The food was just middle of the road. I hope your experience is better than mine."}
{"text":"Had the Ranchildo.  Real good.  Bottomless chips and salsa.  Our kids got free sundaes!  Service was great."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience during the week. It was really cold outside and they turned on the fireplace to keep all the guests warm and happy while they enjoy their meals.  They had a fajita special going on that day so my whole family ordered fajitas. We also had margaritas to wash down the fajitas. The margarita were fantastic, flavorful and plentiful.  They brought chips and salsa right you our table. The best part was that there was a check in offer that provides a cup of free cheese. The cheese made the chips so much better to accompany with, especially since I'm a cheese lover.  The waitress was extremely nice and helpful. She constantly came in to check on how we were doing and she made sure our chips were topped off at every single turn.  Extremely happy with the service and the food was delicious. Can't wait to have another On  the Border night for some more margaritas and good food."}
{"text":"1st visit. Freshly made chips and flour tortillas. Good stuff Maynard. Guacamole made fresh every 4 hours. Good service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in on a Thursday night around 8 PM, so it wasn't too busy, which is expected for a weeknight.  To start, the customer service here was fast... but almost too fast. We were seated right away, they took drink orders, and brought them right out with some chips and salsa. At this point they took the food orders and I added a margarita to my order (since I had just gotten water before, I hadn't even looked at the menu yet). They brought the margarita out within a minute or so which was great, and then the food came out less than 10 minutes later. Before I was even halfway done with my meal, the server put the check on the table and said it's there for whenever we're ready. She didn't check to see if we wanted dessert, another drink, or just anything else in general. We felt very rushed at this point. She wasn't bad, but wasn't very friendly either.  Now on to the food... I had gone to On the Border back in LA years ago and always remembered enjoying it. I never thought it was the best Mexican food, but the quality was good and the atmosphere was nice. This came nowhere close... I ordered shredded beef enchiladas and they were not good at all. The tortillas were so chewy I could barely cut them and the red sauce tasted really weird. The rice and refried beans were both hard and tasted like they had been sitting out... My boyfriend had ground beef tacos and could barely eat one.   They get two stars because the margarita was very good (I had a double house margarita, grande and could REALLY feel it) and the chips and salsa were pretty good too. I told my boyfriend I'd only come back to have drinks and chips by the bar.   It's a shame because I love the atmosphere of those types of places and I'm still looking for a new favorite in the area."}
{"text":"Poor service, poor food that wasn't worth the price. Never again will I come back should have 0 stars!"}
{"text":"************FOUND gummy substance in sour cream sauce.  Not a chili.  I suspected it was gum.   Service was bad.  Food was worse.  Atmosphere is casual, and quaint.  Tables and chairs sticky.  I would not go back.  Prices high for Mexican food, which is very cheap to make."}
{"text":"Wonderful visit.  The chain has really improved their offerings.  Great service too!   Very happy customer!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! I definitely recommend the chili relleno's and margaritas."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night and the restaurant was very accommodating. We had a party of 9 and a half hour wait. They ended up clearing some tables quick and getting us seated in less than 5. The El Jefe and Herradura margaritas are the better option over the house. House margarita was premade and too sweet. Ordered Mahi tacos and they were pretty tasty for inland North Carolina. Normally don't do the \"chain\" spots but this was a goodie."}
{"text":"I took a friend from out of town there yesterday for lunch 9/17/2015. We got there about 11:45 Ordered lunch I am sorry to say it was the worse lunch I had. The shredded taco was dry could hardly chew the meat the soft one was the only thing I ate on my plate the beans were terrible tasted sour the rice had no taste at all. The waitress was good but did not even ask if everything was ok because I would have told her they need to fire the cook. Don't understand with this negative feedback why they do something about it. I was really embarrassed taking someone here and the food was not even eatable .  9/24/15 iI was contacted by the manager Craig and told me he was sorry to hear about my experience and said they wanted to make it up. I will try it again and see what happens. I love there margarita's especially the Watermelon. I was glad that they took the time to address the issue that I had with my meal hope the next time will be better. Love Mexican food."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the chips and salsa we probably would have starved. The size of the portion for the fajitas reminded me of the samples they dole out at SAMs clubs on Sundays to entice you to buy the real thing. The drinks called \"swirls\" came out plain... What a bunch of false advertising! AND don't ask for extra cheese, because they will charge you a dollar for about a spoon full! Total rip off! There's hardly any music in the place, felt like I was in a cafeteria... Clank clinkity clank!!"}
{"text":"Achiote Tacos on this visit and it was very good with grilled pineapple and veggies.  I didn't love the sauce on the side, so I just skipped it and added salsa to it instead.  Probably my favorite chips and salsa at a chain restaurant and I ate my fair share this trip.  Two margaritas and two tacos and I was good to go for New Year's Eve with friends.  Yes, It's a chain, yes it's a pain to go to the mall to visit, but OTB is pretty consistent and we'll be back I'm sure!"}
{"text":"The service was great but the food wasn't that good. Nothing special! Just OK!"}
{"text":"Many many years ago I use to take the family to the Tucson location and always enjoyed the atmosphere, food, Sangria Swirls and salsa. That location closed back about 6 yrs ago or so. This location was nothing to write home about the Salsa tasted flat with no zip and the swirl was weak. I'll pass next time"}
{"text":"We went in about 4 p.m. for happy hour. We had the house Grande Margarita, for $4 and chips and salsa. Before we went in we read the reviews and was hesitant to go in. But we wanted to try it so we did. We were seated and greeted immediately. We sat outside, it came out in a timely manner. Margaritas were great salsa was good. So we're willing to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go out to eat for Valentines Day. We called On the Border Mexican Grill and was told there was a 15 min wait.  When we arrived there was only about a 10 min. wait.  Our service was amazing and our waitress was Victoria D was a rockstar. She was very helpful and answered all of our questions.  I would high recommend this place and make sure to ask for Victoria.  I think the rest of the help are great, but Victoria was amazing."}
{"text":"As a convenient option for lunch with co-workers, we stop by probably once a month. The service is good, but I think sometimes they get a rush and don't know what to do. The wait staff is nice, but can be spread thin. Our waiter this past time could not have been more than 19, and didn't pick up on cues like an empty water glass.   Our chips and salsa took a while to come out, but once it did it's fresh. Everyone at the table gets their own cup of salsa, which for me is a nice thing. Most recently I got the shrimp fajitas. Although a little oily, it had good flavor. I wish the veggies would have been a little more cooked, but overall it had good taste. For $16 it comes with beans, rice, and tortillas.   Overall, a good option for lunch, just don't expect it to be super quick."}
{"text":"Don't get the Shrimp Tacos! Such a waist of even a name for them.  It was basically a burrito cut in two, stuffed with different types of cabbage and peppers with white sauce.  That's it!  I found a total of 4 nickle size shrimp, one of which was found on the plate and other two tacos didn't have any shrimp.  Plenty of cabbage tho.  The waitress did apologies after showing her and offered something else. They were also out of soda when I was there.  Management should know if there is a problem they cant control, like the soda machine going down, they should focus extra hard on things they can control like the food."}
{"text":"Visited this location for a early and quick family dinner with two little ones.   Well it wasn't quick.   Unfortunately it took us over 15 minutes to get a kid's plan sundae (equivalent to a scoop of ice cream) and 4 very small sopapillas.  In addition the waitress could not ring up my bill correctly which added to the unnecessary about of time spent trying to get out of there.  I spoke to the manager  regarding my experience while still waiting for the kids deserts and bill. He went to look into the matter.  The desert eventually came along with our bill correctly process.  However unfortunately there was no apologies from the waitress for her processing my bill incorrectly nor the amount  of time wasted and the manager never came around to check and ensure all was taken care of.   The food was great but the service was AWFUL.  We hadn't visited for almost 1 year and I remembered why now."}
{"text":"Yet another reason to stay away from franchise chains.  I've only been here due to proximity to where I live and how much I craved some margarita with patron. The overpriced margarita was definitely good.   Would take a free meal if I was offered one. No other reason to go back here otherwise."}
{"text":"Disappointing... with so many great Mexican food restaurants in Arizona I'm surprised this place survives after the experience we had.  The kitchen was backed up, which happens, but unfortunately the food was not worth the wait.  The fajitas had no flavor and we got refried beans when we had asked for black beans, but we had waited so long we didn't send anything back. I gave 2 stars because the tortilla soup was pretty good and maybe it would have been better if they weren't having kitchen issues.  We got quite a few apologies throughout the evening, but no visit from the manager, dessert or reduced bill - we didn't request any of these things, but other restaurants have offered after less disappointing experiences.  We'll stick to Rio Rico for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I'll go ahead and pull out another star just for location. We currently reside about two minutes down the road and had never been to a On The Border Mexican Grill. So, we decided one afternoon to try this place in hopes of adding a new restaurant to our favorites list. Wrong...the service was distasteful. The waitress was upset at my husband for returning his food because he did not like it. It's not like he ate it and was trying to get out of a bill. He legitimately took one bite and was done. I then took a bite of my tacos and was displeased but continue to eat them because I was hungry. However, I told my husband not to force himself to eat the food and to return it for something else or nothing at all. He proceeds to return the food for nothing at all and the waitress immediately caught an attitude. We asked that she no longer wait our table and requested to speak with the manager. The manager then came to speak with us, apologized for the issue and introduced us to our new waiter who was AMAZING! We ended up leaving the new waitress a $40.00 tip and thanked her. The reason for the three stars and not five is because the food was not that good and the first waitress we had was horrible. I'm probably not going back and I hope that the first waitress got her act together."}
{"text":"Parking lot seemed full but we were seated right away. Hailey was everything you want in a server and more: friendly, attentive, and made an awesome tableside guacamole. The chips were big and crispy, the salsa delicious. I had the green chile chimi and loved it. The refried beans had a really nice smoky flavor and the rice was on point. Next time I have to try the margaritas! Unlike other places, refills on the rice and beans were free. Loved it!"}
{"text":"40 minutes for a stinking burrito, the hostess didn't care and food looked and tasted horrible. First and last time."}
{"text":"Service is always very good!  Great margaritas!  Staff is friendly and helpful!   Burritos very good - salsa is excellent"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance for a Mexican Restaurant. Great selection of food and great tasting! Chips and salsa \"Some of the best Salsa I've had.\" It has just the right amount of kick! The Cheese Queso is mouth watering. I love hot and spicy and this is where it's at!! Different, but just decent Tortilla Soup. I'm a very picky Tortilla Soup eater lol."}
{"text":"What a joke 6:00 on a Saturday night can't get a seat in the bar not because it was full but because they are poorly staffed, didn't have servers to serve us. GM should be fired here"}
{"text":"Enchiladas were so good! Ask for Fernando he makes a great margarita and is an awesome server!"}
{"text":"I have had my ups and downs with this place. Twice, they have given me my food over-cooked. But they did make it right where they brought out another tray for free and the whole bill was on them. I do recommend to ask for Alejandra. She is, by far, THE BEST girl ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered by Postmates today, I ordered the smart fajitas with black beans and guacamole. I received fajitas dry tortillas no beans no guacamole. Just mad, I paid over $30.00 for this lunch and didn't even receive all of it! Come on Border! It's one little order to go!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican food chain. The grande taco salad its great. With a side of ranch of course.  But its the people that work there, they have some really good servers. In fact alot of them move up and out sadly.   This specific location had a bumpy start with me and worked really hard to to fix it and over the last year have just been wonderful"}
{"text":"Cute theme place. Both my son and I ordered too much and left with containers. Service was great, waiter kept coming back with drink refills and to see if we needed anything else. I like the build your own combo. My son had the chicken enchiladas and I order soup and a beef chimi. It was all pretty good."}
{"text":"Love the food! My favorite is the chicken crunchy taco and the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. I personally think the black beans are a little salty but when I make black beans at home I use the low sodium so my taste buds may be a little more sensitive to the salt in the beans. I also love the chips and salsa, the salsa is always very fresh. The menus are almost always dirty which is part of the reason why I gave only 4 stars. We have had a few bad experiences with servers being really slow, never refilling drinks and only checking on us when they take our order, give us our food (sometimes) as most of the time a different person brings the food and when they give us the check."}
{"text":"We like this place better than the rest of the chain, boring, mediocre Mexican food joints such as El Torito, Macayo's, Manuel's, Gardunos, or Garcias. The portions are generous, the food seems fresher and more colorful than these other \"Americanised\" Mexican places. Good service too. The chicken quesadilla is great, and their nachos are served as individual chips piled with meat and cheese on them, sort of unique. Like I said, this is the best of the chains, but its not authentic Mexican food at all!"}
{"text":"We had a gift card and remember going to one of these restaurants in California and wasn't particularly impressed.  However, this one had a much more expanded menu with barbacoa and carnitas, for example.  The chunky salsa was flavorful and had a little bit of kick to it and the chips were very good.  I was surprised that the food didn't shot out immediately like at most Mexican restaurants but it was nice being able to  enjoy a drink and conversation before the food arrived(not too slow but not immediately either).  While I have had more distinctive barbacoa enchiladas, these were very good and the carnita taco and spinach/mushroom enchilada were also very good.  Our waiter, Jamie, was very attentive and filled drinks and cleared plates efficiently and was a very nice guy!!  Overall, we enjoyed the experience and like the many choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dining experience tonight all thanks to Cassandra!! She was adorable!! And this place has THE BEST margs in town. They are my absolute fav, especially Monday- Thursday when it's only 5 dollars for a grande strawberry marg !!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was cold. I asked for a manager to complain about the  food, the server came back out and said the manager told him to resolve it. The server was new and had only been there for  2 weeks . Although, the manager replaced the food the service was terrible.  Therefore, I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Server was cool. Beers took awhile to get. Food took also a lot longer than expected. Chips weren't fully fried. Brought me the wrong burrito... But whatever. I'm trying to give this place a good rating but it wasn't what I expected. Won't come here again unfortunately... A lot of other great Mexican food around the area."}
{"text":"Fue un desmadre.   Restaurant was nearly empty yet it took 20 minutes to be seated.  Only 3 of us received menus.   Only 3 of us received silverware.   My son was given 2 random soup spoons.   Out of 5 orders 1 was correct.   The food came out haphazardly.   My enchiladas has sat under a heat lamp but were then allowed to sit and get cold.    All vegetables (lettuce and tomato) were omitted from all orders.   My wife's tacos were cold and served just meat and and tortillas.   The refried beans were the consistency of soup.   Truly an awful example of a chain Mexican restaurant failing at the easiest of things.    This was the culinary equivalent of waiting at the DMV or sitting through the emoji movie.   Skip this unless you're a masochist."}
{"text":"If your hungry for some salty tex-mex this is your place. It's good and it will fill you up. The fish tacos were fried more like tempura. I liked that they were really crispy but too salty for my taste. I like the spinach and mushroom enchilada because it wasn't swimming in cheese and tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Wife and I had lunch here yesterday. I had never before been to this location and hadn't been to any of them in about 6 years. It was never great but it has gotten worse. Food was just bad and overpriced. Tasted like zero effort went into making it. Taco Bell is better. We will never go again."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and everything was phenomenal! The manager Aaron greeted us upon arriving and seated us!!!! the We had the border sampler and it was super tender, chips were crispy.  My bf had the ultimate fajitas and it was delicious.  Everything we tried had a different sauce/ flavor to it and we practically licked our fingers .  The service was top notch, Bret was always available when needed.  this place is very authentic and is definetly our new favorite Mexican food spot, we will most definetly be back..."}
{"text":"I  went there for the first time. The food was great and the service eas also great. The only thing I  would tell yoy is don't order water it had a bad taste to it but I  am used to bottled water. Everyone was happy with the food"}
{"text":"I've edited this review to say that after the restaurant received my complaint, they called me and apologized. I wish they wound have handled it better while we were there, but I appreciate them reaching out. I also threw another star their way for the effort.  If I could give this place zero stars, I would. But the avocado fries were quite good, so perhaps that is where the one star can come from. I wouldn't really know on the rest of the food because after waiting for over an hour for our entrees to show up, we had them wrapped up to go. And by the time I could sit down to actually eat, the food was cold and gross and I threw 3/4 of it away.  I was visiting family in Arizona when we went to this On the Border. Our  party consisted of 3 female adults (including me) and two children, a 5yo and a 16mo old. We arrived at 4:45PM on a Saturday and were sat quickly and ordered appetizers drinks and entrees quickly. We received drinks and appetizers in a timely manner, though we did have to stop our server and other workers to get us refills on drinks and chips.   But that is where the positive experience ends. After we received our appetizers, we waited for 45 minutes before we were told that the food was held up because the 5yo's chicken strips were frozen. We were not given an opportunity to order something else for her, and though we asked to have the rest of the food served, it was not. Then our server told us that there was a complete breakdown in the kitchen, which led to all the waiting. However, we watched no less than 6 tables around us arrive, order, eat, pay their bill and leave. These were tables comparable in size to ours. Also, when we arrived and ordered well before dinner rush, there were hardly any other patrons.   Finally at 5:45 after we had been there an hour, I asked to have the whole order wrapped up to go. Our server was apologetic, and offered us free dessert that we did not want. The manager did not come talk to us, and no one offered to comp any portion of our meal. The order STILL took another 20 minutes to get to us, and we finally were able to leave at about 6:15.   There was a major breakdown in communication that I have never experienced at any other restaurant in my life. I will not return to any location of On the Border. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"3 of us visited (2 adults & 1 child) the day before Mother's Day and I got a certificate for being a Mom.. Yayyy me!  It was our first time at OTB and the food was excellent.. Staff was very friendly from the moment we came in and you get large portions for the money..   The reason I gave the 5th star is because we had a server named John which was outstanding.. He literally would walk fast/run to the back.. When you can show customers that you will hustle that means a lot to me..  Go John D."}
{"text":"Over priced fake Mexican food. I've been to Los taquitos on Elliot and 48th street (I think).   Just expected a little more for what I paid for."}
{"text":"I have to say they have pretty good tacos here, wait staff are very friendly and the manager is pretty attentive to his guests. I will keep coming here. Margarita' s are good too."}
{"text":"I've only done the take out. The food is pretty good for a chain. The staff is superb. Several times my order wasn't right, but i was compensated. Just hard when it's your lunch and you get back to your desk and find out it's wrong. All in all I like it."}
{"text":"For a chain place not that bad-but typical chain Mexican food.  Nothing special. I do have a question though. Do you ever dust the lamps?  You could see the dust on the post that hangs the lamps all the way up to the top.  Kind of nasty."}
{"text":"Service was decent.  Food was o.k. My daughter had the kid's mexican plate with taco.  Appeared to be standard Phoenix Mexican fair.  My son had the kid nachos, cheese was a little over cooked.  My wife had the enchilada with sour cream sauce, she said it was o.k.  I had the fish tacos, cilantro lime rice, and grilled vegetables.  The vegetables and cilantro lime rice were amazing. The fish tacos were good.  I've never had fish tacos with cheese before, and I didn't really care for it.  Debated sending it back but it wasn't that big of a deal.  The placards and menus had grime on them.  That was a little alarming.  Other than that it was good.  Price was right too, $24 for a family of four-no complaints here on that.  One of those places we would go back too, but probably not be like oh le'ts go to On the Border."}
{"text":"This restraint has recently changed their menu and the over all way of doing things. As for the food, It's good food, for an \"OK\" price. I use to feel that I had great value for what I got, Not so any more. A couple of things I like, The combo meal, 2 or 3 item. Not bad, liked it better before they raised their prices. Every meal comes with in-ending rice and beans. What I really don't like, they tried to make a more fancy look by use smaller plates, the are long plates that your entrees barely fit. Good luck trying to add the rice and beans that are served family style in a separate bowl. Also Happy Hour, I hope you like sitting in an uncomfortable bar or outside. Because you can't enjoy Happy Hour in the restaurant. You would think they would use happy hour to attract patrons???"}
{"text":"Usually, when you go to an average Tex-Mex restaurant, you expect average - go figure. The food, the drinks.  Usually, the service is pedestrian - but with a warm, friendly tone to enhance your evening.   Tonight, expectations were met - sort of.   The food was good - not great - just what we were in the mood for - Tex-Mex in the same vein as every other restaurant in genre.  We had the combo plate and Fiesta Chicken and both were full of flavor but nothing original.   Our server was quick and attentive and nice - but had the attitude, face and posture of an individual who may never see happiness again. We wanted to give him a hug.   Ultimately, we came in with no expectations and left with no expectations. All-in-all, a very Buddhist evening."}
{"text":"Stopped in with two firefighter friends (they typically know their food) and had excellent service by \"Lawrence\". We all enjoyed the fish tacos (they ordered them without the sauce because it's spicy hot). The tacos are the real deal. I ordered a carnitas taco and enchilada, excellent! I like the they way the do rice, and beans family style, just share. Chips are awesome. They really seem to have raised their game. Manager stopped by the check how this are. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has turned the corner!!!  Amazing service, sitting at the bar you won't be disappointed in bartender Brad....friendly, helpful and excellent customer service.  Drinks are wonderful as is the happy hour food menu.   Happy New Year!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting an On the Border and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but a gift card brought us in for lunch.  Our waitress was sweet and she started us off with the customary chips and salsa which had just the right amount of spice.  I ordered the fish tacos and I thought they were pretty tasty.  This was my first time trying fish tacos so I'm not sure if they compare to other restaurants but I thought they were great.  The only thing I wasn't happy with was my side of grilled veggies.  They were covered in some kind of seasoning that just ruined the flavor for me.  This made me sad because the zucchini and red peppers looked amazing but after a couple bites I just couldn't eat any more.  The one thing that put a damper on the meal was when the waitress and manager couldn't figure out how to process our gift card.  The waitress was totally baffled and tried to tell us that we had a zero balance on the card when we'd only used half of the card value.  We had to ask for a manager and the manager was so confused she had to call another store to figure out what was going on.  The manager figured everything out eventually and we walked away with half the balance left on our card.  Even with the gift card mix up I would still come back just for the fish tacos."}
{"text":"The food is decent and I've gotten good service here. Some of the specials in the bar area (like the $1 taco Tuesdays) are hard to beat. One disappointing thing is that they charge for sopapillas, which many Mexican restaurants provide free. If you sign up for their e-mail list you get some nice discounts."}
{"text":"It was fine. Food was average, a little bland, but appetizing. Drinks were okay. Service was average. I would never choose to go back, but if all my friends were going I wouldn't put up a fuss."}
{"text":"I came here twice, and will never return. The first time I had an amazing experience despite the food being very mediocre for the price, our bartender made our visit a remarkable one. The second time the food was the same but, unfortunately our server was just average. The reason I won't be coming back is because of the tall shaggy looking manager. He's rude and is probably upset that he will never go anywhere in life. He does not walk around with a smile and he down talked several employees in our two visits. He's probably lost many good employees due to his poor attitude. I'd avoid this place as long as there is a negative vibe like him around."}
{"text":"I have been saving money to get married recently, but we got a gift card for OTB, Chilis, Macaroni Grill or someother place I haven't heard of (Italian).  We always go to Chili's so we decided to go here.  I have been to other locations twice before and each experience was okay.  The chips were okay and the salsa was great.  It seemed fresh.  We got good service and the fiancee ordered a margarita which was tasty.  I just didn't enjoy the food as much as I do at a more authentic Mexican resaurant.  I ordered a chicken chimichanga and rice and beans and the refried beans have not been my favorite and nothing about the experience was bad there, but I just have no desire to go back any time soon.  The service was good, but this place was sort of blah.  If I lived back in Pennsylvania, it would be okay Mexican food, but out here in AZ it is nothing to go crazy for."}
{"text":"9 times out of 10, when faced with a choice of restuarants, I prefer locally owned joints over chains. This place is a good reminder of why that is.   We ended up going here because someone had given us a gift certificate.   So, we stopped in for a late lunch - we arrived well after  the \"busy\" time.   We thought we'd have quick, attentive service, but that was not quite the case.  Our server was friendly, but rather slow in getting drinks out to us & taking our order.   I decided to go simple and have a chicken burrito with rice & beans.  The food tasted ok but was not what I would consider to be particularly good. It was just meh. I can definitely make better chicken burritos with beans & rice at home.    But the worst part was about an hour after eating here, I started to feel yucky.  I was not \"sick-sick\" but felt as if I had eaten too much of something that I am senstive to - like too much MSG .   I think that most fast food and big corporate chains use some MSG in their food but I try to avoid the ones that use way too much of it.  (The problem is that it doesn't always show up in an ingredient list as MSG - sometimes it is just labled as \"natural flavorings\" or  something to that effect).  While a little bit of this stuff is not generally problematic for me, I do find that  when places use too much, that's when I notice the icky feeling.    Places like Applebees, Chilis, On The Border, etc  often use chicken (and other ingredients) that have been seasoned at a central plant, then frozen, and shipped out to the individual locations... these flavorings that are mass-produced are more likely to have too much stuff like MSG in it to try & make it taste better when it is ultimately cooked up & served to the consumer.    Honestly,  there are way too many other good places to eat in this area for me to choose to go back here.  If I end up getting another gift card for  here in the future, I think I'll re-gift it to some one who would better appreciate it.  Next time I have a craving for Mexican when I am close to home, I'll head over to Maria Bonita (Rea/Colony Rd),  Senor Tequila (Piper Glen), or Cabo's (Carmel/51)."}
{"text":"REALLY disappointed!  I've been eating here three or four times a month and decided to take a break in June.  We finally went back on Sunday, and wow...the entire menu has changed, and not for the better.  The taquitos (or flautas) are off the menu now, but they kept that disgusting empanada (all flour, no taste).  So, I was told they would still make them (keep in mind these are small, rolled, fried meat-filled), and what they brought me - as an appetizer I assume - was something thick, still fried, but with a different filling that was a LOT spicier and not as good as the original, AND charged me $10!  We also decided to order their special, which was two chicken fajitas, a bowl of queso and sopapillas for dessert.  The queso was thin, as if they'd been adding water throughout the day to stretch it.  It was also not mentioned that the fajitas would be a lunch portion only (we were there for supper) and no one asked if we wanted flour or corn tortillas (I would have preferred corn), or what kind of beans; they brought watery refried beans that are probably the worst I've ever tasted.  To top it off, they were out of sopapillas!  It's on the special.  Advertised.  And they were out.  But they substituted a brownie sundae to share - which had me wondering, since everyone around us was receiving an individual sundae with the special, why did we receive one to share?  Just curious about that one...  Bottom line: We were told  \"Corporate\" decided to change the menu.  Now it's just like every other Mexican restaurant in town, and we have no reason to drive the twenty miles to eat here.  We don't eat at Chili's because the food is blah, and it seems that On the Border has joined that club."}
{"text":"I placed this order for delivery, I must say  it was terrible.  I ordered chicken fajita nacho's.  I might as well walked to taco bell. Not recommended will not return."}
{"text":"This location is closed today, got a staff meeting.  Can't they do this before or after business hours? They have a table outside offering \"catering\" coupons. What a joke....now off to Macayos, where we should have gone in the first place."}
{"text":"Ultimate fajitas are good for a chain restaurant.  Rib Eye steak, chicken, and pulled pork, on a plate filled with sauted peppers, onions, summer squash, and zucchini. Fresh homemade corn tortillas on the side and a side plate with Tex Mex rice and beans.  Enough food for two people.  Always attentive service.  I can't give On The Boarder a  five because they have limited gluten free items.  Highly recommend for a chain."}
{"text":"Corporate management made contact with us and we did indeed return for another visit / meal.   Much improved."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying before today, I've been here multiple times, and each time it takes at least 2-3 hours to have a meal. Even if it's not busy, the service is just terribly slow. So anyway, the only reason I ended up here again is because my brother from out of town loves their Southwestern Chicken Tacos. So we go on a Saturday night, it was pretty dead, seated promptly. Got queso and avocado fries to start with, queso tasted like melted Velveeta and Rotel tomatoes. The avocado fries were surprisingly tastey, I'll give them that. Also their salsa is very good and fresh, they're good about keeping the chips full. I got the Tortilla Soup, thinking it was the safest bet, considering I never like their food, and it was terrible. Lukewarm, plain chicken broth, One side of avocado, little bits of gross chicken, soggy a tortilla chip, and a big lump of melted jack cheese at the bottom. Never coming back. 2 stars for avocado fries and yummy salsa."}
{"text":"absolutely horrible. am I allowed to give this -15 stars? terrible service, terrible food, terrible wait time. all in all a terrible place. don't go here!"}
{"text":"I'm Sad to say this was not a good experience. While I understand that I went with a large group of friends, 15 girls, for lunch at noon on a Saturday, I was not impressed. Our two waiters for the table came over and evenly divided up the table. Since my friends and I had to get back to our conference training in an hour and 15 minutes, we placed our drink and food orders immediately. Our waters came out within a few minutes. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. 50-55 minutes later, our food arrived. We had to scarf it down in order to make it back on time. So once the food arrived, we asked it we could have our checks (trying to be efficient with our time). Half the checks came, and the slowly the other half of checks came. 20 minutes later, some of us where still waiting for our change. While my cobb salad was good, and the mango vinaigrette was amazing, I was barely able to enjoy my meal, because we just kept waiting."}
{"text":"Portions have reduced and pricing has increased ,overall not a good experience. Had the fajitas for two, use small tortillas and are very frugal with the toppings of shredded cheese,sour cream and pico, hardly any roasted peppers or onion! Ordered the queso dip in the bowl size which looked like the cup size put into a bowl ! Not a good lunch for the money they charge. Would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"One star for the nice server ...but the food was awful. The shredded beef taco salad had chunks of beef that were covered in straight chilli powder... horrible. The after taste it left was disgusting."}
{"text":"There was a time that this wasn't too bad of a corporate restaurant.  Besides the usual musical chairs with menu items that corp restaurants love doing, the food has never been too bad, and some dishes in the past were quite passable and good.  However, it would seem things have took a turn for the worst.    The main problem is the overall service.  My family and I (4 of us total) sat for an hour waiting for our meals and watching people that came in after us get their meals.  Instead of just telling us they messed up our order, they just kept bringing chips and assuring us our dinners were coming out, which they never did.  We finally got up and walked out in frustration and disappointment.   After several months of staying away, we returned to give it another shot.  Again the service was extremely slow and we didn't even get the common courtesy of the waitress checking to see if our meals were ok.  So, not only this time were they slow, they were not even courteous or showed any care whatsoever.    The food overall is just average corporate flair, and through the years they have removed various items I used to order frequently, which is what is very disappointing about corporate restaurants as they don't believe in consistency.   However, what really kills this place is the service and obviously poor management."}
{"text":"Worst first time experience here.  I went in with my fiancé for dinner last night and the service and quality of food was well below standard. We were never checked on during our meal and had to eat the ice in our cups just for some liquid. We were sat in the way back where no serving could see us. The food was no very good. We started out with a half in half of guacamole and cheese. We took one bite of the guacamole and got nothing but the taste of salt. When we asked them to take it back and bring us a different one we were told that it couldn't be done. When our food arrived the hard tacos that were ordered had the chicken in them, and we're very soggy from obviously sitting too long. The rice that came With my meal was good but the beans were disgusting. During the night, my fiancé and I both woke up with stomach pains. The only common food that we ate yesterday together was at that restaurant. I still was feeling nauseous today and even had to leave work early. We will not be dining at this restaurant ever again. I wish I had read the reviews prior to going to on the border."}
{"text":"I always enjoy their food- however recently the server didn't take my dietary concern seriously and if I didn't say anything I would have been sick to my stomach the whole night. Not to mention how disgustingly rude the employees are...do yourself a favor and never come here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this one star because I got horribly sick from the taco chicken salad that I ordered.  I'm still really irritated because I had a 20 mile run scheduled and I had to skip it.  The sickness was around for over 12 hours :(. I will never eat again at this restaurant chain.  I'm guessing that the chicken was either old or not properly cooked.  In addition, I ordered the Texas Cosmo which was disgusting.  what a disappointment!  When I think of Texas, I think of big.  The drink was small without a great deal of flavor.  This is precisely why I stick to restaurant chains such as Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs, and Ruth Chris.  They never disappoint me and the food, drinks, and service are always on point."}
{"text":"The best thing about this experience was our server Greg. He was a tall Older gentlemen with a surfer type accent. Very cool. Once we were seated no one came up to our table for a little while, I am not a complainer but when I have to bring up the wait time for anything to my husband you know it is not good. Thankfully, Greg noticed us and took us on as one of his tables. My husband ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas which were about 16 dollars and I ordered the shrimp ones which were close to the same price. It was pretty bland and your typical franchise tex-mex place. We usually go to Rio cafe by our house and we will be sticking to it because at least there the taste is authentic the portions are bigger and so are the shrimp. For the price we paid at on the border it was a rip off. We won't be back but if you are in the mood for an overpriced unauthentic Mexican style cuisine then go here and make sure to ask for Greg!"}
{"text":"OTB listens to it's customers.  Tonight my enchi plate came out hot with cheese all melted and gooey.   OTB has been consistently good. EAT HERE.  Best salsa too.   I have always been a fan of On the Border.  After a long absence of not eating there due to quality issues I returned and was impressed with some positive changes.  We had the best server ever (Victoria.). The food was very good. I had the queso enchiladas. Sides of bean and rice are served family style. Husband had fajitas and they came out sizzlingly good.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because I think they should heat the enchiladaa little hotter.  Changed to five stars."}
{"text":"My grandmother and I just came in for a late lunch. We got seated and 10 min went by without anyone coming to us. Then a waitress named Alicin asked \"has anyone come to help you?\" We said no. So she took our drink orders and got us chips and salsa. She told us that she was actually serving the other side of the restaurant but she wanted us to be served. She treated us like royalty until we left that door. She even gave us free dessert! We left very satisfied. Hope for her to be our waitress every time we go."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex chain restaurants are as inspired as the American hamburger these days, but On The Border really sticks out for quality service, food, and portions.  I can't say that I was overly wowed by it, but I was quite pleased with what I got.    On all occasions I visited, I have had friendly, personable staff who seemed to enjoy what they were doing and joked around with our party.  Their taquitos are great; crispy fried goodness with chicken, onions, and covered in sauce.I agree with Kathy that the food is greasy, but what can you expect from a chain like this?   Rather than the obligatory refried beans and dried-out, bland rice of most places, they use black beans and well-seasoned rice.   The chips and salsa were surprisingly fresh and not overly salted like other Tex-Mex chains.  For a chain, they have surprisingly fresh food.  Service is quick and On the Border is rarely crowded like neighboring restaurants.  I recommend it for a hearty lunch with co-workers or friends. It's nothing that will leave a lasting legacy, but On the Border probably won't let you down either."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and had no issues. Margaritas have always been top notch but not today, May 5. I realize you were busy but the margarita special was not good. They are usually very consistent in taste. Something was off today. Please don't do specials then cut corners on quality."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a Mexican food lover so it's not hard for me to rate this restaurant decently! Great food, great atmosphere and AMAZING happy hour. Their happy hour has great food/drinks/pricing! Love their salsa and live guac is a must! Their margs TASTE delicious but could use a little more tequila ;) Overall, great experience and food!"}
{"text":"The waitress Meagan was awesome and the manger Casey was outstanding both took the time to make us feel very appreciate as a customer will return often"}
{"text":"Order takeout which is usually a great option when we have done it. Wasn't so good this time, the order wasn't right and the meats in the ultimate fajitas was just ok. Disappointed this time but I will give them a chance again in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at On the Border in Concord today for a late lunch/early dinner.  We always dine in the bar because of the atmosphere and vibe.  We had Neil for our waiter/bartender, and he is so personable.  Our food was delicious and our drinks were cold and satisfying.  He visited with us just enough to make us feel at home and stay longer for another beer! :)  Great place, great service, and great Neil"}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite place to eat. Unfortunately the Mesa location has ruined it for me. I decided to give them a second chance after my last attempt at ordering online ended in a disaster. Turns out they really should just stick to on location ordering. Once again I was told my order was complete by their online site and once again my order was not available after I drove 20 miles to pick up my order. When I arrived some cranky blonde girl seemed too annoyed with her life to help me out. I do appreciate that the manager was willing to get my order made up once I spoke with him, but too little too late. I'm officially over On The Border."}
{"text":"This place was amazing in Texas and is just as amazing in Las Vegas.  I am SO SAD this is the only one in the ENTIRE valley -- where is the South Vegas love, guys?!  Yes, I have made the drive JUST to eat at this place.  And that's almost an hour.  I would drive further if need be.  Sadly, because of said drive, I can't go here as often as I like... but maybe that's better because I'd be super-broke.  Every single visit I have made here (about a handful?) has been epic.  The servers we have gotten each time are extremely awesome, helpful, and always have crazy great personalities.  They seem to genuinely love their job.  Wow!  The food is just as good as it was in Texas.  Scratch that... GREAT.  Guacamole Live is a staple of my OTB ordering.  I cannot visit here and NOT order it, even if I end up ordering other things.  Margaritas?  Awesome and HUGE (and taste like they get extra shots in 'em...whee!), the beans are awesome (and I'm not crazy about beans), their homemade chips are GREAT (ask for a to-go bag of them -- you can reheat them to their cooked perfection with the special bags!) and pretty much anything else I have ordered is stellar.  Carne asada tacos, queso, quesadillas, you name it -- they rock it.  I wish I could teleport here at will -- then I would give it 6 stars.  -;)"}
{"text":"They are consistently confused. My husband and I are trying this place for the second time and they still sucks. My husband ordered a Bohemia beer and the waiter repeated it four times like we were crazy. We pointed to it on the menu and he stared at us still confused, so I asked him to verify they have it in the bar.....he comes back and says yes. Really? Ordering food was the same confusion ... Not going to come back......good was ok"}
{"text":"On the Border is a great place! We've come here twice, in the past 2 weeks, and both experiences were wonderful! ! The watermelon margaritas are amazing....make sure to get an extra flavored shot added to it- I love adding the Madori! The fresh chips, and salsa are always plentiful,  and irresistible! ! They have weekly specials, and the food is nothing to complain about. Both times, our servers were very friendly, accommodating, and very attentive!!"}
{"text":"Went here to #Ontheborder, directly after work recently...and I have to say that although the food is consistently great, the service is hit or miss at best, especially during the times between lunch and dinner.    I don't know why, but I have a penchant for visiting this particular O.T.B. in the early afternoons usually between 3-6pm.  I ALWAYS sit at or in the bar area.  The last few times I've been here, it was like the bar tenders and other employees were too busy fixing, cleaning and organizing  things; things like the margarita machine, changing the Dos Equis keg, cleaning the liquor bottles, etc to provide good, attentive service.    If the staff needs time to organize and prepare for the nightly dinner rush, I TOTALLY understand. Perhaps they should consider simply shutting down from like 3-6pm, plenty of establishments do it.  I rather that, then patronize this place and be forced to play second fiddle to a margarita machine..."}
{"text":"OMG. WE LOVE MADDIE!!!!  Every time we come here, we are looking for her !!!  She is the most delightful, adorable, FUN server we've ever had ---ANYWHERE!!!!   She just is so natural and openly friendly that she makes the world a better place even with just  her smile !!!  What an absolute DOLL.  THANK YOU Maddie for always making our dining experience 100% perfect. And then there's the prickly pear margaritas... lol."}
{"text":"Good was hot and fast... Sat in cantina section. Kelly was our server and sucked.don't get her..."}
{"text":"I love margaritas and they are pretty generous with the tequila here. I've tried a few different flavors (frozen and on the rocks) and they've all been tasty. I stay in the bar area so I can't recall what the rest of the restaurant looks like, but the service in the bar area has always been great. Only things I can remember trying here are the chicken flautas and one of their quesos (sorry can't remember which one). And both were pretty good."}
{"text":"Coming here for happy hour during great weather is awesome! I always request to sit outside on the patio! The happy hour margaritas are AMAZING and the food is good too. Honestly, I love getting a side of rice and beans and then something off of the Happy Hour Menu. All of the servers I have had have been awesome and informative. They are always willing to give their opinion and make sure they are describing to me what is in the food, the best they can. I would recommend coming for happy hour with great company."}
{"text":"On the boarder is a very family friendly cantina. We have never had anything that we didn't like. The staff is always very friendly and the drinks are always cold. All the food is pretty good the price is a little high for the value"}
{"text":"Although they don't have happy hour specials like in NY, the food was great. I absolutely loved my steak. I was not pleased with our wait being that it was pretty slow & it took them a bit to get a table cleaned when they had no one else to attend to. That was on the host not the waitress."}
{"text":"I guess I should have read the reviews before coming. But I came in on a Sunday afternoon, about 2 pm. Not incredibly busy, and wasn't understaffed based on what I saw. I got the chips and salsa before my drinks (water). I finished my entire bowl of salsa before my girlfriend and I received the water glasses. We put our order in, after waiting 10 minutes for a waiter to take our water order, and I had to ask for more salsa, we kept waiting and waiting. Salsa never came, couldn't find my server. She finally comes out of the back and serves another table. By this point, water and salsa and chips pretty much empty. I was waiting on service for too long. We left before receiving any food. Horrible."}
{"text":"Pro's: Free chips. Great customer service from waiter. The burrito I ordered (the Bordurito) was really good. Black beans. My sister ended up paying for the meal.   Con's:  Rice didn't seem authentic and neither did the refried beans."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.    I usually go with the Big Bordurrito with re-fried beans instead of the salad.  They are just much more tasty and seem to compliment the burrito much more than a salad does.  I have had their fresh, made at your table guacamole on a few occasions and can attest to it being \"REAL.\"  Its fresh, and you can taste it.  The chips and also are perfect, they are the quintessential chips and salsa and are what every Tex-Mex establishment should serve up.  The salsa is excellent and always tastes and looks fresh.  I go here at all sorts of times, after movies or shopping at Concord Mills, or my gf and I will grab a Big Bordurrito to go and sit it at home in front of the television.  Sometimes I just go on a random weekend day for lunch and sit at the bar, drink a few Dos XX  Ambers on draft and do work on the Big Bordurrito.  The bar tenders are always chill but on the job, ready to fill you up with more salsa or get you another beer whenever you need.    I can't really speak for any other menu items other than the Big Bordurrito and the table-side guacamole. Both are extremely tasty and you get big portions of each.    I know its a chain, but what can I say, I AM A FAN, and of course, I WILL be back soon!"}
{"text":"The chicken tortilla soup which was served to us was veryyy salty and Again when we asked for the new one .... it was the same salty one. Chicken enchiladas quantity is very less . May be the time., the floor was all dirty with the food on the floor. But the chimichanga which I ate was veryyy tasty. I can give 5 star to chimichanga!!  The tortillas were ok."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We went there to try the food to see if we wanted to use them to cater an event. Glad we tried it out first. Not enough staff. Our waiter did his best but had no help. Took forever to get our food and there weren't very many people there. When the food did come it was luke warm. Very small portion size for the price we paid. Did not taste fresh at all.  The chips and salsa were good thankfully. Overall, it was a poor dining experience. My kids even said they didn't want to go back again. My family is usually very easy to please. Sorry, can't go back, and will continue to look for a caterer."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this chain restaurant a few times at various locations, this one did not disappoint.  Once again I had my traditional Chicken Chimichanga, it was great.  The chips and salsa were also good, great server. Then why a 4 star, salsa could have used another pinch of jalapeño or habernero.  Definitely will be back again. Reasonable prices, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"After work a group of us girls wanted to head out for margaritas and how can you pass up a $2 margarita?!?!? Well... @ On The Boarder you can. We chose to sit outside and the waitress did her best but did admit that the drinks were taking awhile due to them being so busy. When she brought out the margaritas in child size cups we couldn't do anything other than laugh. We asked for her to just bring us another round which she said we could only have one at a time? Laughable. We did order some snacks/dinner and I will admit the serving sizes are huge! 2 people could definitely share it. I think we'd go again for a cocktail after work but would definitely skip the drink specials & they can save the cups for the kiddos."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Mexican restaurant! The chips and salsa are always fresh and they keep 'em coming. Kelly is the best server and always treats us right. I love to get the combo plate and mix it up each time but the ground beef tacos are our favorite."}
{"text":"We had lunch at this location and had Anthony as a waiter. Anthony was horrible. He brought us our chips late. We ordered Queso. When it did come out our chips were almost gone and he did not bring any through the whole meal after we asked him too. When we did ask him for chips he said he would be right back, but went straight to a table 5 ft from us and started cleaning it. My wife's tea was almost empty and he said he would refill that also. This did not happen  until after our food was at the table. I had a full Queso with no chips. I was not happy and will not be back to this location ever. He hardly ever checked on us to even see if we needed anything. I have actually had bad service before, but this takes the cake."}
{"text":"This is an OK place to go and hang out with some friends after work and maybe get some chips and salsa. I went there for dinner and it's basically what you'd expect from a chain Mexican restaurant. I was not impressed. There are much better places to go if you are in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Started by walking in with two people standing in the \"to-go\" area and not saying a word to us. Stood there waiting with multiple servers walking by also not saying a word. Finally a host came up, no greeting asked if we were two. As I walked to our booth the floors looked like they haven't been swept in the last week. Our server showed up five minutes later. We ordered drinks. We asked for more chips because it was taking so long. 50 minutes later our food came with one of the me also wrong. Tortillas hard and cold, missing half the meat, which our server did correct and  have them bring us more.  this would typically be the cue for a manager to touch the table. I used the restroom that had also looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a very long time as well as a broken soap dispenser. Just disappointing overall. Update-the server had the meal taken off that was messed up and the manager still didn't take time to come over and table touch. That's the difference between corporate and family owned. Corporate managers just don't care"}
{"text":"When I came here I was excited but leaving very disappointed. The food was not fresh. The cheese on my meal wasn't melting very well and my sides looked like they were just thrown on the plate and wasn't very tasty. My chicken on my plate was too tender. Our waitress was nice but everything else was very poor. Even the appetizers were not even very good the chips were stale and the salsa tasted raging. I won't come out here I really didn't see effect in this service or cooking for that matter!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 4, the restaurant was busy, but we were seated immediately. The waiter was great, the food hot, an ample serving and our drinks were made well. We will return."}
{"text":"On the border has terrible food the floor was covered in tortillas chips the waiters never show up on time the fork and knife that they gave me had dry up food still on it I paid for my meal and they gave me the wrong change it was two dollars short and they kept arguing with me and I just left it's not worth the trouble,I'll never comeback to eat here not worth the money"}
{"text":"Bleh, I hate chains... and On The Border Ballantyne gave me yet another reason not to venture to the nether regions of Charlotte. Service was incredibly slow, the food was pretty decent, but it took so long to get my bill that any joy felt for my meal was long gone before I left the door.   The only reason I darkened the door of On The Border was a sorority function, the staff had advanced notice that there would be ~20 people in our party and they seemed ill prepared/short staffed to handle us."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Had to wait over 10minutes from the time we were seated to when we got a waiter for our drink order."}
{"text":"How can you not love Mexican food? On The Border offers fresh food at awesome prices. We decided to check this place out during happy hour and left SAT-IS-FIED! First off, you get chips and salsa before anyone even takes your order. During happy hour almost all appetizers are half off so you can't go wrong with the Dip Trio (under 3 bucks), just wait until you try that cheesy goodness. Beer was  cheap too so the only item we paid full price for were the fantastic Chicken Fajitas. Oh man, I totally fell in love with their in-house made tortillas. it's always great to eat anything made from scratch using fresh ingredients! The service was as friendly as anywhere else and if anything, they were quicker than most places. For under 25 bucks, we left as happy campers. I will definitely want to hit up On The Border again soon. :D   Note: Happy Hour rates were only good in the bar area."}
{"text":"Ugh. Not good. Here is a list of crap that happened at our visit. 1. Took forever to get our drinks. 2. 2 of the orders were backwards- had the wrong meats-no apologies no nothing. 3. They forgot to deliver our \"unlimited\" beans and rice-by the time we flagged our waitress down most were almost done with their entree. 4. Found a bug in my drink. Yum. Go here at your own risk. Overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"I had never been to an On the Border restaurant until Friday and I'd always wanted to try it. We ordered the made-to-order guacamole to start which was FABULOUS. They make it right by your table and give you these massive freshly made chips to eat it with. Yum. For my meal I got the fish tacos and they were delicious but really filling. We sat on the outside patio area and it was nice, minus the annoying flies and gnats. It would be nice if they put some screens up on the windows. Our waitress was super friendly and kept making sure everything was fresh and tasty. I will definitely be returning for that guacamole and to try what else is on their menu."}
{"text":"I love happy hour $3 frozen margaritas are great and the chips and guacamole, love the wings... always a table available or not too long of a wait... sometimes the servers have too many tables but they manage to get your food out"}
{"text":"Bad service, forgot two drinks gave us the wrong meal twice. Food was bland worst OTB I've ever been to"}
{"text":"My husband and i go here every couple of months. Service has always been really great. My favorite thing here is the queso! However the last couple of times we have gone the food was really dry and not very edible. I always order the same ultimate fajitas but each time i go back it gets worse and worse. Big bummer they took out the pacifico draft or I would at least come back for drinks and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tuesday is the day to go here. It is \"Taco Tuesday\" and boy are they delicious. I had the soft taco in beef and one in chicken. it was almost too much for me to eat. I love the way the server comes by the table to see if everything is ok and to refill my drink. I never ran out of something to drink and always had plenty of tortilla chips to munch on."}
{"text":"On the Border is one of my families go to spots if we are going out.  We are a family of 5 and we can order for everyone and get out for under $60. The food is good and the chips and salsa are made fresh right there.  I recommend the Dos XX fish tacos, always hits the mark.    If the wife and I make it a date night she likes to get a top shelf margarita or 2.  Never had a bad experience.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time here. Tried it out for National taco day. They were offering 50 cents mini tacos. The choices are beef, chicken or veggie tacos. It comes with lettuce & tomatoes on the side and melted cheese on them. They give you free chips and salsa, it was good. The chicken tacos were actually better then the beef tacos. I thought the tacos would taste better considering the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I just got a new iPhone installed the yelp app, signed in opened it,   With All this spare time I have because. I'm still waiting for the sever to take my order. I've Ben here so long that I'm thinking of leaving but I'm sooooo hungry. They still have to take y order and make it!   Smh,  ugh..... Still writing ....... There's a Osaka across the street."}
{"text":"I am in Huntersville 2-3 days a week for work. There are a dozen or so restaurants that are near my hotel and On the Border is a part of my regular rotation. The food is above average, staff is friendly, and although they have regulars they are just as friendly and engaging to the other customers as they are with the regulars. Thomas has been the bartender on each of my visits and he does a great job."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to order Mexican food. If u like food served cold & 45 minuets after u order, then you came to the right place. I will give them Zero for food & Zero for service. Server TJ 2 was slow in getting anything correct. Asked to speak to a manager, never came. Never again !!! Will not recommend to anyone. Location: 1710 S. Power Road. Went there at 3:30 pm on Sunday. There were a total of 5 tables wasn't even crowded. Unbelievable bad food. Come to think of it I am sorry I left Tip, will be embarrassing when u have 5 other people with you."}
{"text":"What can I say...just plain terrible all around.  Came in and nobody came to our table, two of the servers were arguing who was going to pick it up.  They were trying to be sly by talking about the table number, but since we were the only party seated in the section, it was obvious.  I had the bowl....it was the fattiest fajita meat and the entire thing was tasteless.  Was thinking how Chipotle would have been a better choice and half the price.  The avocado fries were tasteless...wasn't sure if I liked them or not, so I kept eating them.  After getting home, I had an intense urge to vomit and I started to think the oil or batter was old.  Just plain terrible.  Will never return."}
{"text":"This is a typical moderate food joint, not fast food and not fancy schmancy. I  came for HH with a group of girls, the waitress was great and attentive to all of us. She was not cranky because we all wanted to eat and drink cheap or that we did that and took up two of her tables for a couple of hours. I think her name was Christina?  The HH here is pretty decent, I had a $4 regular margarita and $2 avacado fries. But they had plenty of other food and drink specials 3pm-closing time. I have ate a meal here prviously and remembering it to be good, not amazing but it was good. The avacado fries were big pieces of avacado battered and fried (I picked the cripsy coating off but it was yummy with just a bit much for me these days, other wise I would have been in deep fry heaven). The Margs (as my new friend calls them...haha) were good as well. The $4 version was served in a 8-10 oz mug, strong enough for a $4 marg and not too sour. I'd definitely come back for HH again."}
{"text":"How does this only have 3 stars!?!?!?!?!! This place is absolutely amazing! We've been here twice now, excellent service and Phenomenal food! Best chicken fajitas that I've ever eaten in my life"}
{"text":"Only taking one star of because the service is sometimes a hit or miss. However the food and drinks are always great! I come here regularly and never had a bad food experience. The late night bar menu is a great value! Sign up for their email list because on the boarder celebrates a crap load of holidays(national tequila day, margarita day, taco day, on the boarder birthday, cinco de mayo,etc..) with drink and food specials!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been there in a few years. Got 2 seats at the bar for dinner and drinks. I needed to use the ladies room first. Glad I did. Gag much? Filthy is an understatement. If you like to see feces, overflowing toilets (all of them) and wet, nasty, floors and sinks. Ran out of there, told my hubby let's go. It took 15 minutes for him to pay for the overpriced beer. It wasn't busy. Never going back, unless we feel like having a bowl of e-coli or hepatitis. Found a better, clean place after that unpleasant experience. Wonder if the staff washes their hands. Doesn't matter - never going back."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and usually had a good experience.  Last Friday night was the opposite.  The service was SSSSLLLLOOOOWWWWW!!  Our waiter, after being very slow with our drinks, finally appeared with a tray of drinks for another table and said \"I'll just drop these drinks at another table and be straight back to take you order for food.\"  Twenty minutes later he reappeared and took our order.  After another 20 minutes of waiting for our food he finally came back to say it would be out shortly.  By this time I had had enough and that I surely hoped it would be out shortly or we would just change our order to breakfast.  He then did the one thing I find completely inappropriate - he said the reason for the slowness was that the kitchen staff was shorthanded. I said \"That sounds like a management problem.  Don't make us suffer because of your manager's inability to do his job properly.  Now, please bring out the food without further delay.\"  That worked and the inept manager actually got off his butt and helped get food out.  The food was so-so.  I had ordered a chimichanga, which I thought by definition is a fried burrito.  It was not fried, but rather compressed in a hot sandwich press, the kind they use for things like Reubens and grilled cheese sandwiches in other restaurants.  The place was not even that busy for a Friday night.  I may give them a second chance, but one more experience like this and I'm done."}
{"text":"Few weeks ago, went here really to get a drink. Wish the waiter would have been honest.  I wanted a daiquiri, he said oh yeah we can make it. Well it was terrible.  I could barely choke it down. Plus side I had ordered the sampler plate. It was pretty good. Could not eat it all. It was a snack later that night.  I am sure that their house drinks are fine, they are use to making those. But the special order was not working.  Waiter was friendly and check on us."}
{"text":"Chips are very good (fresh and crispy).  Salsa is OK, just not as good as most restaurants. Everything else I tried was sort-of gross"}
{"text":"We went and the service was slow and our food was wrong.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican Grill, I can eat there everyday. Love their Margaritas, their salsa is out of this world, and I know salsa lol. My only complain is how fast the food comes out. I have talked to them so many times about that until I gave up and designed my own system to ordering. If you order a bar drink, soup and dinner, they all basically come out together. I understand it's a corporate restaurant and they like to flip their tables in appx 1/2 but gosh, if people can relax and order drinks and enjoy the evening they would make more money. Now I order the drinks period, when we're done drinking we order soup (their tortilla soup is a must) when they bring the soup we order the dinner."}
{"text":"Ask for Cody. Great food and outstanding service. Appetizers empanadas are delicious. Had chicken tortilla soup and it was great. Tacos and rice and black beans. Delicious. Busy Saturday night but you would have never known it.  Great time."}
{"text":"Sunday night...  Sat in the bar.  One server.  Granted, she was hoppin', but when the food came out cold, and no one came to see how things were...  We had no choice but to just eat it. I usually just go for chips and queso and now I know why..."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Just today we eat there. Very reasonable price!!! Lots of food you get. Always have box up. Salsa homade chips. Great service. We go there every chance we can when in town from Maricopa AZ.  Judy Jenkins and James Mitchell"}
{"text":"Service is below one star, Amanda worst server this year and that's saying a lot, one of the problems we have in a state where servers earn  over $8 an hour. Well putting servers on notice if I don't get a good standard of service you will not get a dime from me!"}
{"text":"They don't serve Mimosa's (or any alcohol) on Sunday until Noon. The service was great on a Sunday! The lunch size portions were perfect."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to On the Border. I think it was when I was in college when I first went and it was pretty wack. It was beyond wack... I couldn't believe this place existed. I guess they did an overhaul on the menu... perhaps I have the restaurants confused... oh well... This day! Kat made the experience and food great. Sometimes when the food is okay, the staff makes the people come back. Kat hooked us up with extra and gave us tips on the food. I've been here a couple times but this time was the best. I customized my fajitas and got the pulled pork and grilled chicken. I put the sautéed onions, peppers, guacamole, sour cream, refrained beans, queso, shredded cheese, and salsa.   Yea... I'm one of those people who puts a lot of sh*t in my eggs... But I like it. Chips and salsa are good. Definitely coming back to this location, especially if Kat is here."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. They serve the best beef chimichangas for my area. I always sit at the bar or take my food to go. The staff are nice. And should I call in a order they do they best to fill it right the first time. Great black beans/rice and they go down hill with the dips. The cheese dips are not good at all. It don't matter if u have it in the store or should u take it home. Each time you go something is very good and something is very bad. They often bring you dirty glasses. That's just so not cute. I'm in a good mood so 3 stars for them but look twice I may give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"The best customer service I've had in a long time. The dining experience was amazing. The food was amazing, the waiter didn't mind when I added something on, and I was here for two hours without ever feeling rushed. I'll definitely be back. 120$ was well spent"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch two weeks in a row.   I was very impressed with the cheese and onion enchilada with red sauce, perhaps one of the best enchiladas out there. Today's meal just as good. Quick friendly service. In place of rice and beans we substituted grilled vegetables. Recommended."}
{"text":"The only reason I rate this 2 stars is because of the staff. Staff is friendly and I'll give them that. Otherwise, this place is probably what del taco would taste like if it were a sit down restaurant. The food is way over priced and very disappointing to what you pay for. I was really craving Mexican food but the usual place I go to (Leticia's) had a long wait and I was just too hungry to wait. They played cringeworthy music for being in a \"Mexican\" restaurant; I felt like I was shopping in a Forever 21 store! And the food was really mediocre. Definitely not an authentic Mexican restaurant. If that's what you aim for, go to Leticia's Mexican Cocina!"}
{"text":"The food and service was outstanding. I'd love to come back because it was a beautiful restaurant to dine. I recommend you going as well. I really enjoyed it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A letter going out to On the Border CEO Clark in todays snail mail.  August 21, 2013 Stephen V. Clark Chief Executive Officer On the Border Corporate Headquarters 2201 West Royal Lane Suite 240 Irving, TX 75063  Mr. Clark.  I thought I would write to you today to let you know that I have been a loyal customer of your restaurant chain for many years. When I travel on business and get to my hotel I usually look to see if one of your On the Border restaurants is in the area and at least once a week I will wind up having dinner there or just hang out in the cantina for a while. Most often on business trips I visit your outlet in Kennesaw Georgia where my company is located.  When I moved from Connecticut to North Las Vegas in the fall of 2011, I was pleasantly surprised to find one of your restaurants not far away in Centennial (5630 Centennial Center Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89149). I actually found out about this particular On the Border because I received an email from your corporate office regarding a free lunch for Veterans Day or Memorial Day 2012 (I can't recall exactly which one.)  And this is where my problems with your organization began and why I will no longer visit your restaurants.  1. I went to the Centennial location for the advertised Veterans special; I sat down and asked for the Veterans Day menu and I was summarily told that this particular establishment does not follow corporates advertising and marketing campaigns. I was not pleased, however, I still ate there that day.   2. The week of August 4th 2013 I took my son to your restaurant. My son is 3 months shy of his 21st birthday and he is an active duty United States Marine (at the time on leave from Okinawa Japan.) While here in the Las Vegas area, my son has never had an issue sitting in a restaurant cantina or bar as long as he is not consuming alcoholic beverages. On this particular occasion we were going to order lunch while sitting in a booth along the windows as far away from the bar as possible. It was not long before we were summarily kicked out of the cantina into the regular seating area. I was informed that since he is not 21 he couldn't be in the cantina. Well, it was annoying but if that's your corporate policy, I figured we would get over it.  3. At least twice a month my wife and I visit this location for Taco Tuesday. The day before my son returned to his Okinawa unit (August 13, 2013), we returned to your Centennial location for $1.25 Taco Tuesday. I walked in the restaurant and mentioned to the manager about what happened the week before, that we could not sit in the cantina, but we wanted Taco Tuesday. He told us he could not serve us Taco Tuesday specials in the main restaurant and that since my son was not 21 and could not go in the cantina, he could not take advantage of the Tuesday special! He wasn't very pleasant about it either.  After I gave your manager a piece of my mind, my son and I did an about face and ate at one of your competitors locations down the street (in their cantina no less!)  As stated above, I will no longer visit any of your locations, local or otherwise.  Sincerely,"}
{"text":"The food and service is top of the line! Anyone who is on the hunt for outstanding Mexican food, look no farther. I had Dos xx fish tacos, and my bff had the 3 sauce burrito.  Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Went th ere today to take advantage of their endless enchilladas.  Service was outstanding. Very good atmosphere.  Food was a real bargain when you consider al you can eat enchilladas for eight bucks  and they were good."}
{"text":"Tonight I had a great night with my sisters. We had gone ahead and stopped by at this location as we were hungry for some Mexican food. We had been greeted by a friendly smile as we were seated as soon as we walked in.  The place was clean and the customer service was great. I did however have to wait a few mins to get a refill and also a few more mins to check out. Overall this place had been a 4 star experience for me."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food for a chain. They have a fantastic happy hour! This restaurant has been here for years. I'm certain the reasons they've stayed in business while others have folded around them include good food, reasonable prices, upbeat atmosphere, great happy hour, and very friendly service. It seems many of the employees have worked there for years, this is a good sign.  Is this drop dead awesome Mexican food? No. But, it's good and plentiful. We love the homemade flour tortillas and salsa.  If I were in Ahwatukee and wanted Mexican food, I'd stop in and eat."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite local places to go but after this last Tuesday I'm not sure I will ever come back. Where do I start; we sat on the patio which may have been a bad choice since we were the only ones out there. Inside was not too busy though either. Waitress sat us, we said \"we're here for taco Tuesday\" she said \"great\"! She took our order and then we never saw her again. No drink refills, no water refills, no check in to see if we needed anything, we had to go inside to get the bill, then go back in 15 minutes later to pay the bill. Wow!!!  Now for the tacos, we ordered 2 tacos each we thought were off the special taco Tuesday menu..... I guess not! We had chicken tacos, ground beef tacos, in hard and soft shells and one fish taco. Only one was a special $2 taco, all the rest were $4+.... what a joke! I just paid the bill without complaining (since there was no one to complain to) and will go to the many other establishments around for taco Tuesday from now on. And the Tacos were sub par at best."}
{"text":"I used to love this place as a kid. But it has definitely gone downhill. They need to learn how to make rice and beans, because what they serve is nasty. Half the time we are waiting a long time to be seated, because the host is nowhere to be found. Would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted a bite before going to the movies.  We walked in around 2 on a Friday, so there wasn't a wait.  We chose a booth and was greeted by our waitress.  She took our drink order and left us to decide what we wanted for our meals. We decided on some tableside guac, which is made to order and fantastic.  You get a serious amount of guac, which I probably ate too much of...if that's such a thing.  Definitely consider this if you're going for some apps. I wanted to go a little lighter on my meal, so I ordered the chicken fajita salad.  It was good.  The chicken was juicy.  I choose the avocado ranch, which was something different.   You don't find that many places.  According to our waitress, it is made in house. Our waitress kept coming over to refill our drinks, drop off napkins, and check if we needed anything else.  I have been to other OTBs, but this one had the best service and food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with the wife and was greeted by a server who didn't have  lot of enthusiasm at first but later found the energy.  The food was great. We ordered the stuffed jalapeños, bs tomatillo ck enchilada 3 sauce fajita and the Dos XX fish tacos.  We ordered the 3 sauce fajita ck burrito for my son and told the waiter to please please please do not include any cheese for this meal we were ordering it to go. Well when we got it who would have guessed ,it had cheese on it.  I was a bit annoyed because we had been there for sometime and wanted to go home so we had to wait again for another meal to be remade.  When it did come the manager Sean Puhl apologized but didn't offer to take anything off the bill for our inconvenience.  It may be sometime before we go back here with so many options to dine in the area. To Sean Puhl and management make it right to your customers, never assume we have to eat here."}
{"text":"Food is great, if you like waiting for 45 minutes for it. There were three of us and its not like we ordered anything complicated either. The server did aplolgize several times and offered us free dessert, which was also a waiting game as well. I love the food there but thats about where it ends."}
{"text":"Always yummy food at on the border. Our waitress was so cute and friendly  clean bathrooms  we got our food fast which was a bonus we had a big group  the only thing I would say was the tables were to close made it hard for the waitress to serve us but she recruited some help"}
{"text":"The staff greeted us with a wonderful smile they were quick to refill chips and drinks they had a great special on Guacamole so of course we took advantage not to mention the offer a reward program to get free stuff  I had a combo meal so did my little one she substituted the rice for beans though. Hubby had a huge chimichanga so big taking all good home for lunch tomorrow"}
{"text":"Much better service and experience than our last visit. I am so thankful for that since I love their food.  One thing I can say is the endless beans not my fav because they don't put cheese on them I love my cheese"}
{"text":"Great food and good variety. The staff was really friendly and service was good. We liked eating outside on the patio. Tried the Border Sampler with my fiancé and it was a great choice to try a little of everything. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Always come for a nice melo dinner nice family enviroment, Foods is pretty bomb I love the big burrito. Its huge always have left overs My kids love chips and salsa."}
{"text":"This is the only Mexican food restaurant you can go to and NOT find a Mexican either cooking or eating. I grew up eating \"mexican food\" this place is on the border just not sure which one. That being said there are some items on the menu which are good, but it's mexicanesque at best. I mean good food just don't get a craving for authentic mexican food and expect to satisfy it here."}
{"text":"Here for Valentine's Day because didn't make reservations elsewhere, but WOW! Food was fantastic, service was amazing, price was right! Heather D, our server was so good, made the experience fantastic. Come here for money well spent"}
{"text":"First time we ate here on a Saturday about 1. We were sat quickly and our server came to offer drinks . We ordered heradura margaritas very fast and they were awesome. Chips and salsa were good tasted freshly made. We were also given queso moments later. Then manager came by to see how we were liking it so far and introduced herself and recommended the green enchiladas with hatch NM chili.  My wife got the new mexico relleno and enchilada. Then other manager came and introduced himself and offered us the queso and sopapillas  free. Great service from everyone and our server was very attentive. We got our food fast not bad at all. Enchiladas were good not as good as I make but not bad. We would be back if in the area again."}
{"text":"We were seated right away, served chips and salsa, no water. Our server took our drink and food order at same time...5 minutes goes by and we ask our server for water...10 minutes later, no server no water. One of the hostesses walked by and we asked her for water. She said she would find our server. I stated we asked him 10 minutes ago and he never came back. She walked away with a audible sigh, returned with 2 glasses of water set them on table and walked off...another server walked by (15 mins by now) and we asked him if he could find the 2 margaritas we ordered. He returned with them and was very nice. Another 10-15 mins goes by and hey, our server comes over and asks how we are doing....we didn't answer him and he said I promise your food will be here soon. 10 mins or so goes by and someone (not our server) brings our meals which were very good. Fast forward another 30 minutes and our server drops our check off.   He didn't ask us one time during our meal if we needed anything or how our dinner was. Between him not being on the ball and the hostess with attitude, we won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant Ive been to in while. I went out on a limb and order mini steak tacos... When they came out it more looked like beef jerky on chips, rice was hard and crunchy. Best thing was the chips and salsa.."}
{"text":"Horrible service along with over priced, horrible tasting food. The only reason why we went there was because my children's school had a fundraiser and we wanted to support. We will never return again. The server dropped our plates on our table with a horrible look on his face and didn't say one word to us. We had to beg for utensils and napkins well after our food was served. It wasn't even busy the day we went. Beans tasted like they came right out of the can and the rice was just gross. The only thing decent was the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Came and ordered the chicken fijitas and house margaritas! We were well pleased with the taste and quality of the food and drinks. Our service was okay, but he couldn't quite hear us due to our party being talkative so I guess that was more of our fault! Overall it's a good chain restaurant to eat at!"}
{"text":"My first time having On The Border ....and I give them an A+ !!! the food is seasoned well , refreshing , and light if you just want a snack"}
{"text":"OK so this isn't the best restaurant around but my kids love it. Those staff seems to be very friendly and enjoy working at that place. There aren't a lot of low calorie options but I guess that's the point. This place can get quite crowded on Saturday night or Friday night. You will not have trouble getting a seat if it is just two of you but a family of 4 could-be waiting 25 minutes easily."}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good, but it is a chain so consistancy is pretty easy. However 9 times out of 10 we get crappy service. First you sit down, get ignored for a while. When you get your drinks, drink slowly, you won't be getting a refill for a while. This is the only location even remotely close to our house, which sucks. If it wasn't for the food I wouldn't come back, but yet I find myself here at least once a month so me and the wife can split the Ultimate Fajitas. The margaritas are also amazing, always strong and fresh tasting. PLEASE reopen the Stapley location!"}
{"text":"Got a gift card from an acquaintance. I decided to try it out. It was, by far, the worst food that I've ever had at a restaurant. It tasted extremely processed, and as if it had come out of a can. For the price of around $15 a meal, I can think of a dozen actual Mexican food places in the valley, that serve great food at a lower price. It's been about six hours since I ate, and I can still taste the food coming up from my stomach. I'm sure my review won't be taken seriously, due to its one star rating, but it was so bad that I had to write something. This establishment was also extremely tacky and food was all over the floor. It was free, due to the gift card, however...I would have rather paid for a good meal that didn't taste like a bad TV dinner."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Chips, salsa, and guacamole (table side) were awesome and the server we had (Lasette) was wonderful. House margaritas were just ok (from the bar while we waited), and we had to ask for lime wedges. Had the spinach and mushroom quesadilla, and that was on point. It's .99 for extra sour cream, which seemed silly. My husband ordered the 3 Enchiladas and really loved it. The refried beans had a nice smokey flavor.  Overall, we'll definitely be back, and I'll probably order the quesadilla again!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going here but it has gone down hill. Went there for lunch today and the enchiladas I ordered came out cold. Also we ordered the queso and were told it would take awhile because they were making it fresh. It came out with a pudding like skin on the top."}
{"text":"I love going here with my husband on the weekends. Tasha the bartender is amazing and always make us feel really special. The food is always good and the price is always right. Everyone is friendly. I take all of my friends and family when they visit me here to meet the amazing staff and have great tex mex."}
{"text":"Only went because we had a gift cards.  Otherwise, based on the yelp reviews and the fact that it is a chain restaurant we wouldn't have gone otherwise.   The garbage can out front was so full it was spilling out on the sidewalk. The free chips and salsa were okay. The service was not very good at all - the restaurant was almost empty, lots of employees standing around and the food took FOREVER. Kids menu options are good and inexpensive.  The meal comes with main dish, side dish, drink and dessert sundae.   The lunch fajitas were good (except the veggies were cold and had to be remade.)  My son and I shared them and had more than enough food. We were charged 99 cents for a side of queso which was not worth the money. Drinks are $2.49 each!!  Pricey! The kahlua mud pie was $6.50.  It wasn't bad but quite small for the price.  I much prefer the one at Elephant Bar and it is much bigger and less expensive."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!! SAVE YOURSELF AND GO TO MIGUELS ON LITTLE ROCK ROAD!!! My husband and I went for valentines dinner.  Please understand that they were not busy when we got there! The waitress was completely untrained. Every question required a walk to someone else to get an answer. Ordered margaritas and a beer. 20 minutes later, after asking where our drinks were, we received a pitcher that was 3/4 full of ice and tasted like plain mixer. The food... for the price, portions should be a little larger than a 5 year olds meal. Our drinks, commentary salsa and our meal all arrived at the same time!! Major WTF MOMENT!! The chicken for our fajitas was over cooked and dry. The place was trashed. Food and debris all over the floor. Vacated tables nearby remained uncleared long after guests were gone. Absolute worst dining experience, ever.  Management/owners should visit Miguel's restaurant off Little Rock rd to see what a real Mexican restaurant looks like. Margaritas are good there, food is delicious and usually can't finish the meal. Much lower price.  Edited on 2-19-18  On the 15 someone from on the boarder commented on this review, asking me to contact the customer complaint department. I sent an email that day and in the email I only stated that I was asked to contact them and nothing more. I get an email this afternoon from on the boarder customer service department thanking me for my comments and they will be sending them to higher up.  What comments?? Nothing was in the email at all stating ANYTHING that happened.  This is what trying to get something taken care of through this company is like. I stand firmly by the first sentence in the review. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I've been here a number of times over the years and I have to say that unfortunately, this will probably be our last.  The g/f and I went there to enjoy their Loaded Carne asada tacos.  They were not what they used to be, but still good nonetheless.  That's about all that I can say was good about the experience.  The Refried beans were gross (they tasted slightly sour) and the same for the rice which also tasted old.  The service was near the bottom of all experiences I've had.  Not the worse, but pretty bad.  Never offered a refill on my beer.  My g/f was never offered  a refill on her water.  Both of us had empty glasses before we finished our meal.  They were still empty when we left.    The worse part was how they served us food and failed to bring out utensils.  I asked the waitress who brought the food for utensil and she was never to be seen again!  So after about 3 minutes of waiting I asked another waitress.  She came back after a few minutes with utensils.  So we were able to enjoy our meal 5 MINUTES AFTER IT ARRIVED.  No bueno!  So we are trying to enjoy our meal and the table next to us experience the same thing...  but only worse.  They get their food and no utensils, so they ask the waitress for some and she says, she will get them.  She then walks over to the register and works on fixing some orders.  Now mind you the people who asked her for the utensils can clearly see that the waitress was not getting them because she was 5 feet from their table.  After waiting 5 minutes themselves with their food in front of them and the waitress they originally asked for them, they finally ask another waitress for the utensils.  They still had to wait another few minutes.  I can only imagine how cold their food was.  About a minute later, I saw a woman waiting by the bar who appeared irritated.  She waited for about 3 minutes and not a single waitress or bar tender was in sight.  She then went to the hostess at the front entrance.  What was she upset about...  She had her food WITHOUT ANY UTENSILS.  This is a restaurant for crying out loud!  By this point, I'm pissed off that what we experienced was very similar to what others were experiencing, so this seemed to be the norm, rather than a one time thing that a simple apology would do.  The waitresses disdain for each other was clearly evident as well.    Maybe I would have enjoyed my experience and would have remembered and cared less if I was drunk...  But I wasn't offered another beer!  So they have no one to blame, but themselves for this scathing review."}
{"text":"I'm spoiled by REAL Mexican food, this is tex-mex average.  The sampler appetizer platter was full of smoky beef tostadas, smoky chicken quesadillas, which we enjoyed both, plus chicken and cheese mini chimis, they were OK  Dinner of chicken enchiladas suiza tasted like chicken n salsa inside corn tortilla with sour cream poured over. Ugh, not impressed.  Refried beans had smoky flavor, rice was bland and dry.  House margarita yuck, tasted cheap as heck.  Service ok, waitress never checked to see if everything was ok.  Headed to baskin Robbins for ice cream"}
{"text":"Service was great just stopped in for a drink and some Tuesday tacos.  Has a normal happy hour and a reverse happy hour. That is nice since most everyone I know Dan only make happy hour if they don't work that day."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chain restaurants.  The chips and salsa are near perfection.  I usually get the combination plates and most items are surprisingly good."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and every time it was great.... this last time ruined it completely for us. I dont know if our server was new or what but our glasses were empty almost the entire time, except when a manager came by to refill them. We watied a fairly long time for our appetizer, which wasnt that great anyways (the stuffed jalepenos were good but thats all) and we waited about another 15 minutes after finishing the appetizer for our main food to bE brought out.... COLD! We were very very disappointed in the overall experience :( We will not return again sadly!"}
{"text":"Togo order: staff was friendly, order was ready quickly and well prepared.  Food tasted great, and well prepared.  Would visit again!"}
{"text":"I go here about once a week. If you go try to sit in mandy s or neils section. All of the waiters are great but they are my favorite. We get the loaded queso and some other food as well and we are never disappointed! Ps. Save room for the brownie!!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of nice spicy salsa. Quick service, but we were there at 3pm, so it's not like they were busy."}
{"text":"The only reason we went here was to use a gift card.... Just as disgusting as i remember."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, I am extremely familiar with great mexican cuisine. Tex-mex has been a longtime favorite since the day I first had unlimited red and green sauce. That being said, my expectations may have been too high coming here.   - The atmosphere was great. The decor made the place really come alive (very similar to many restaurants in Charlotte). You feel like you are in Mexico.  - Sauce is solid, honestly nothing to rave about but it gets the job done.  - The entree's are just really bland.  1) My cousins enchiladas came out cold 2) My enchiladas were just bland 3) Nobody on our table (10+ people) came close to eating their food because it just lacked flavor.   Honestly, I wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to go here and I had no choice. The positive is the staff is friendly and the place is nice."}
{"text":"I give this place 1 1/2 stars because the food is terrible and the waiter we had last night was aggravated from the moment he sat us. This is not good Mexican food. My 3 tacos could have made up 1 whole taco. There were literally 4 tiny blocks of steak in each taco, the cheese was disgusting, the rice was salty and dry, the beans were the same way. My family and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I know that the cool thing to do is hate on chains - pre-prepared food, jarred, not locally sourced, frozen, yadda yadda... yeah, I know.   Whatevs... I am fully aware that I am the opposite of what would be considered cool or hip.    Knowing that I am going to spend the rest of my life alone in a house full of cats, I decided that if I wanted to enjoy the occasions that I get to eat out, I need to learn how to do it alone.  I had a coupon for free queso and a gift card with about $15 left on it, so let's get some Mexican for lunch.  Armed with my smart phone and my handy dandy Kindle Fire, I headed approximately 500 yards from my apartment for an early lunch at the bar at On the Border.   Located at the Promenade on Providence shopping center with a prime corner lot next to Macaroni Grill (both part of the Chili's restaurant group, which is what I had the gift card for), parking was easy on this beautiful Friday at 11:30 am, but I imagine on the weekends, this place fills up quick... parking should still be ample and well lit though.    I was greeted upon walking in and when I said I was alone and didn't need to sit in the dining room I was pointed to the bar area, where I was immediately greeted by Grant, the friendly bartender.  He got my drink order, which he quickly came back with along with a basket of chips and some of their house salsa.  I was given some time to look at the menu, order my coupon'ed queso and the brisket soft tacos with a side of black beans and rice.    The food: Tortilla chips - warm, not overly salty.  Held up well for dipping in both the salsa and the queso. House salsa - slight kick, but it's more of an after-burn.  It was not overly cilantro'ed which for me was AWESOME as I hate cilantro.  Tasted fresh-ish and I thought it was quite good. White queso - white cheese served with pico on top.  Queso was cheesy and creamy.  Grant the bartender said that the yellow queso had a bit more of a kick to it, I found the white to be quite mild and delicious. Brisket soft tacos served with rice and black beans - Black beans were fine, not overly spicy, so that was good.  Rice was kind of... well, rice, with corn in it.  Not overwhelming and good enough.  I found the brisket soft tacos to be pretty darn good.  (tortilla, brisket, cheese, topped with crispy onion rings which were thin and crunchy).  The brisket wasn't something I would find in a BBQ restaurant, but for a mexican restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor.    My Diet Coke was kept full at all times and Grant packed up my remaining queso (he said it heats up well) with another container of the salsa and some more chips.  I had a great lunch, service and food, and will definitely return to On the Border."}
{"text":"No quiero!!!  Wife and I just wasted $60 here. Terrible food. I've been to on the border in Phoenix and it was good. This place is awful, blah! Will not return to any On the Border restaurants again! Also needs to work on pricing $30 a person is way too much for a plate filled with a disgusting amount of tasteless, blah food"}
{"text":"Came in today to have a nice lunch with my son and the ignorant person behind the hostess podium was tacky.  Won't be going to this low class on the Border again.  Great service in different states though.  You can observe the desperation with low qualifications to hire certain people."}
{"text":"First time I've been here, in any On the Border, and I must say I've walked out impressed. The food is above average from any typical Mexican restaurant. Pretty affordable. I had a 10 dollar combo with 4 items and it included rice AND beans with bottomless chips and salsa. I definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"A less-than-average Mexican restaurant in a crowded field. Pros: easy parking. Cons: sloppy presentation, hurried waitstaff (Bailey), undistinguished food, prices inappropriate to the quality of the food. And, the premises were filthy with uncleared tables, food sitting on the floor.  We had to dry our own table as it was soaking wet. We won't be returning so re-evaluate as there many, many better Mexican restaurants all over the Phoenix area. Nough said."}
{"text":"Saturday at 2 late lunch. Just ok I thought. Fish Mango something ok. Drinks where high price. Chips and salsa very good and they offer to get us more."}
{"text":"The food was way salty and the waiters worn saggy pants that are not professional for a restaurant, we will not be going back"}
{"text":"I don't know why the reviews are so low. I enjoyed my food as it met expectations for typical Mexican chain food. The fish tacos are a huge portion and getting 2 is fine. Black beans were awesome. Salsa with the chips are spicy so be careful if you're not a fan. Food came out pretty slow but it was noon and the bartender (Shalonda) doubled as our waitress. She was super sweet and never had to wait on a refill."}
{"text":"Today I went to the location on Centennial and Ann in Las Vegas, NV for the 2nd time.  The last time we went we had a very long wait and bad service but good food, so we thought we would give it another chance.  I guess shame on us.  We had a large party and the restaraunt wasn't busy.  We had to go to the bar to get our drinks because the price difference in the dinning room was unacceptable.  We ordered our food and it took about 45 minutes for half of us to get our meals and another 15 for a couple more to get theirs and then another half hour for two other guests to get their's.  Several of us ordered the Chimichanga which we ordered smothered and none of them came out right, my daughter asked after 15 minutes for her salad dressing and an hour went by before she got it.  One person sent her whole meal back and ordered something completely different and when it came the food was cold.  Then.....the Manager  Dawn came over to the table and spoke to the couple who did not have their food yet and said she was going to take care of their's and when I said really you should take care of the whole table because nobody's was right and she put her hand up to me and said \"I don't hear you!\"  then walked away.  The server Vicotoria, should be commended, it was her third day and she put the orders in correctly and she ran her ass off for us to try and make things right, but she couldn't go back and cook it too!  We asked for the Manager to come back to the table to talk to us and she wouldn't, she went by our table many times and kept her eyes in the other direction.  I can't believe this, it is acceptable behavior.  I don't know if the kitchen was just \"hazing\" the new girl or what but the Server Victoria was the only one who cared.     I hope that you are more concerned than the staff at your restaraunt.  I want to say that I ate at On The Border in Maryland and it wasn't at all like this, but this one has 2 strikes and I don't think there will be a third attempt."}
{"text":"This by far has been my favorite Mexican Restaurant for the past 14 years. I say this because I've never had a problem with the taste of any of their food. There might have been some crazy mishaps before but I'm not going to dwell on that. The servers are amazing here. Jaime is wonderful. He's very quick on getting your refills and anything you need. We've had him quite a few times and he doesn't disappoint. Here are a few problems though. Their decor is dusty, the hanging lights, pictures and anything above is dusty. The women's restroom..ugh..I have yet to go in there when it doesn't smell. The floor is always dirty and usually only one soap dispenser or sink will work. Their table tops are old and gross. The booths are not squishy anymore. Not comfortable at all. Definitely needs remodeled ASAP."}
{"text":"This place has gone to crap. Food was below average  and  overpriced; no one working really seemed to care. With so many other choices on Bell Road why settle for dub-par food and service?"}
{"text":"Made it back for another meal and the service was much better.  Food was very good.  The free chips and salsa are a plus.  I am giving them back a star."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the issue is with the location, however, my last couple of visits have not been great.  About a month ago, my wife, son and I decided to go there for dinner on a later afternoon/early evening Saturday.  The place was fairly busy, but not slammed, and we were seated right away.  It took about 8-10 minutes before a waitress came to our table and we were told that several of the staff had suddenly quit and she advised she would have to serve a large number of tables and apologized.  Since were were already seated, we decided to stay and order.  As expected by her warning, service was very slow, though she was nice about it.  We weren't all that upset, though, and understood the staffing issue.  Well, last weekend at dinner time, we all decided to give it another try, figuring that surely the staffing issues would be corrected.  Evidently not, however.  We arrived to a very light crowd at the restaurant (maybe 8 or 10 tables were occupied) and were told to wait a minute while they found somewhere for us to sit.  We were told the delay was due to a waitress having just received 2 new parties in her area.  So, we sat down and waited about 5 minutes and, meanwhile, other parties are arriving, being told the same thing.  Then, the hostess asks to take our name down on the wait list.  Again, with a very light crowd at the restaurant.  I put our name on the list, but after waiting an additional 5 minutes, decided to leave and go somewhere else, since it was obvious they were still having staffing issues and I didn't want to end up being served by a waiter/waitress with 10 other tables.  So, not sure what the issue is, but they obviously are having trouble keeping staff and also have other management issues.  Bottom line is, I still like On The Border, but beware of this location's issues before deciding to go.  I definitely hope the situation improves, sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly better than expected when I saw 3 stars.  Fresh ingredients and served right off the grill. We had the green Chile carnita chimi Changa and chicken quesadilla"}
{"text":"Food was great & the service was even better!!!  Order the brisket tacos!!!  They are amazing. I will definitely go back & order an adult beverage. They have a wide variety to choices!!!  Great place to gather in the bar & watch the football games on Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently I've stayed away from chains a little too long, because I didn't realize what I was missing. \"gave-in\" if you will on a trip and agreed to eat at a major chain restaurant (which I rarely, if ever, do). Wow, was I surprised. The chips came out hot and well salted, the service was prompt, courteous, and actually quite enjoyable. The menu isn't your boring fake Mexican food and had plenty of both traditional, healthy, and gourmet options. Since I was in a \"give it a shot\" mood, we sampled the ultimate loaded queso and could really have made a meal out of that. Not your typical white cheese boring, this conglomerate of cheese, refried beans, guac, beef, sour cream, and deliciousness was very tasty. For the entree, opted for the enchilada trio and was in heaven with the barbacoa, green-chili chicken, and sour cream version. Also sampled some of the tamales and while non-traditional, had a great flavor and the pork was very tender.  I don't normally say this, but this is one chain I wouldn't mind giving repeat business too! (and already have once before I could write this)"}
{"text":"I took my 3 year old here after a mommy and me morning. We were passed 3 times before someone seated us or even said hello. We sat there for a good 10 min before someone came to get our drink order.  The chips and salsa were good but too hot for my little girl. I asked if they had a milder salsa and she said she would check. She took our food order and I didn't see her again the rest of the time there. A man started helping us. I asked for more tea and some limes on the side and it was never brought. When we were done eating we sat there for 17 min (yes i timed it) waiting for someone, ANYONE to come by and wrap things up with us. Nothing. I had to go to the bar and tell them i was done and couldn't find anyone to help me. I will not be going back. I have worked as a server many times and its not that hard people. To the employees that work there. SMILE, if you are that miserable quit and let someone who wants the job work. K im done..."}
{"text":"I've been to many different OTB's...This was the best customer service I've had at one.  The hostess was very friendly when we walked in. We went to the bar and Tia one of the  bartenders helped us. She was really friendly, fast, attentive and made good drinks.  The food was as good as the other OTB's I've been to. I love the happy hour specials. The food specials are smaller sizes starting at $3. The fajitas were tasty and came with a ton of meat.  When we were getting ready to leave the manager with the cool mustache came by to thank us for coming in, and gave us a bag of coupons to come back again. We will  be back soon!  Tip: The best time to go is Happy Hour.  One of the better ones around.  They have two different times, 3PM - 7PM Mon- Fri and again 9PM - 11PM Sun - Thur.  During Happy Hour you can get a lot of different drinks for discounted price.  I like the discounted appetizers you can get at the bar during happy hour.  You get a cheaper and smaller size which is nice since most of the appetizers are too much food anyway.  I love the stuffed jalapenos, empanadas, corn quesadilla, beef mini tacos, flautas, mini chimichangas and the cantina nacho's."}
{"text":"Food was good and so were margaritas. I give them one star because there's something about Mexican restaurants when you have a margarita and their certainty they can overcharge you. When the check came they had charged us for two extra meals and drinks. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Love the food. The endless tacos was a great deal. Service was well below standard; our glasses were let empty without refills and the time frame for the next order of the endless tacos seemed extremely long.  Location seemed understaffed."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is a great value and provides a nice variety of Mexican dishes. The salsa tastes great, too"}
{"text":"THE HAPPY HOUR HERE ROCKS! Wish it was extended. Love the chips and guac  love the whole atmosphere and the vibe is worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Absolutely amazing! Love love this place.  Was on a date and the service and food was perfect! Wish I knew the guys name who helped us so I can give him credit but wow awesome!"}
{"text":"Note to self... NEVER come to a Mexican restaurant the day after Cinco de Mayo. The service was snail pace, once they got to us. The orders were made all wrong, the food was burnt and the redo was under-cooked. The kitchen staff is in some serious need of help, and sleep evidently."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for a light lunch and a Beer.  The beer was cold but served in a margarita glass, not a beer mug or glass. I had the southwest chicken tacos and my wife had a shredded beef taco.  The tacos were very good.  The cheese crisp was cold, overcooked and bland.  They did take it off the bill. The sink in the women's bathroom was duct taped closed and the stalls were very dirty with toilet paper all around the floor.  Walked by 2 thermostats (they are mounted just below shoulder level so easy to see the top of them.  They were covered with grease and dirt, looks like they hadn't been cleaned in months. Always enjoyed the food but the restaurant felt dirty."}
{"text":"I ate at On The Border which is NOT my favorite Mexican Restaurant by any means. I ordered the Carne Asada which was underwhelming accompanied by a 1/2 cup of veggies and rice and we waited jtoo long for the salad as I had to remind them about it! , what saved this restaurant experiencecwas our sweet, wonderful, polite, delightful waiter NOAH!  What a peach of a guy, who let's the ladies order first and should be grabbed by a PR firm  because this guy has IT!...We had a few other kinks in our food order and timing.  Then the manager came out, whose name I missed, and brought us whatever we wanted and gave us 2 desserts and really cared about us....never was treated so right!  So Cheryl, Vanessa, Dan, Mike, Jason and Hayley send our thanks and we will come back just to see you 2 guys!!  Noah should be the CEO of On The Border!"}
{"text":"The food was good... we had a mix up on our food, the manager came over and said he would fix it. He did and was super respectful.  Good service and good food"}
{"text":"It was taco night last time we came to this location and they were packed, which led us to brush off our negative experience. We tried again tonight. When we arrived the place was empty, but we still waited at the host stand for at least ten minutes before anyone acknowledged our existence. We were sat at a table that clearly hadn't been cleaned, chip pieces on it and drink rings. Our waiter didn't address us for a while and took a bit to bring us water, chips, and salsa.  While waiting to order, we overheard the manager complaining rather loudly in the dining area about her job to other employees, as well as watched our waiter text (come on man at least go to the kitchen or bathroom). When our food arrived it was lukewarm at best. Our waiter never came back to check on us, but texted on his phone a few tables away...he just brought the check when he saw we were done eating, even though we would have preferred sour cream and the correct style of beans."}
{"text":"On the Border is to Mexican Food as tofurkey is to turkey... it's gross... seriously, don't come here. Go to Taco Bell... or Del Taco.   Are you still reading this? Ok, well, I must admit... my expectations were a bit higher than they were received. One the Border is honestly like a \"Mexican\" Applebee's... no seriously, it's very very generic. We had chips and salsa, also known as half taco shells from \"The Bell.\" They were chewy and weird... but tasted ok if you could get past the texture. We also ordered the stacked nachos... don't do this. Nothing about these nachos were stacked... as the bottom was dry and baron. The chicken flautas left nothing to be desired... they were boring and a bit dry.  All in all, icky food... like, super icky. Tasteless and about as close to \"Mexican Food\" as Hot Pockets are to Italian Food. Word of advice, don't do this... don't come here if you want good food. The only reason for my \"uno\" star is because our server was great. Very attentive and friendly... just wish he would have talked us out of ordering more than just booze."}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour and variety but slow.  Big chips and a decent salsa along with a large $3 margarita had this place out to a good start. There are many vegetarian options on the menu, just remember to ask for cilantro rice and black beans as the sides.  The speed at which the food came out was my big concern we stopped in for some enchiladas and a margarita and we were there for 1.5 hours. Over twice as long as we would be at a similar Mexican spot. Factor in kids and things can get a bit difficult.  My spinach and mushroom enchiladas with the queso sauce were good. Topped with a castrated jalapeno slice (spicy parts removed) The frozen margarita was surprisingly strong. Service was decent but it could not fix the slow kitchen. As we left people mentioned a 45 min wait which seems excessive for a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour Menu in Mesa! All I will Say Is Eat the Stuffed Jalapenos......Excellent!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what was going on but they did not have there mojo going! Wow.... when we got to the restaurant it took 15 mins just to get service which I was the one who had to ask someone if we were going to get served. Then we finally ordered and it took a hour to finally get food which I ordered a soup and a single mini chimi and my husband ordered a salad and ONE enchilada. When we finally got our food it was COLD. I'm not talking about warm I mean the side of rice was hard and cold and the cheese that came on the side of the chimi had already started to harden. They kept saying the manager was coming to talk to use and he never came from time we got our food to the time we left. HORRRRRIBLE I haven't reviewed someone in so long and because of the was I felt today I HAD to write something about it."}
{"text":"The fajitas were nothing to write home about. But after a couple of nice big ass margaritas, I just wasn't concerned any more.   Score another victory for tequila over cuisine.   There's better Mexican places around..... but if you just grab a seat at the bar, knock back a few drinks and gorge yourself on their chips and salsa (which are pretty darn good), you won't care enough to notice."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had the Chicken Fajita special for $7.99. It came with flour tortillas, sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole (or cheese). I was debating between this or one of the Bowl options, which look and sound really delicious. My fajitas were good, nothing special but still good. We had 2 rounds of tortilla chips while waiting. It wasn't a busy night at all (it was in the middle of the week), but for some reason, it took forever for our orders to arrive. Would I recommend this place? Meh. They're okay, but I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"I love the food. But they have the worst policy when it comes to splitting checks. We went there with some friends who were out visiting and they put up a huge fight just to split the check. We then went there again tonight with my mom who is visiting and again the put up a huge fight to split the check. The waiter had the worst additude about it. Sad we will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Place wasn't crowded but the server Maria seemed to be taking care of too many tables and visited our table four times before we finally had to ask her if we could order our meal. Came once to bring chips n salsa, another trip for utensils, another to ask if we wanted water. Another to ask if we wanted appetizers. She brought us water and then took our drink order and said I'll be right back. Guacamole was good and food was descent but probably won't be back. We went there for my husbands bday and it wasn't the bday meal he had hoped for."}
{"text":"I went here on Monday night after a quick trip to the mall. It was the best Mexican restaurant I have eaten at.. lots of menu items that are Mexican themed. I had a awesome pulled pork sandwhich thing that had avacado and jalapano peppers on it, with a side of fries. the  white cheese dip is so fresh and amazing. I couldn't stop dipping my fries in it. My friend had the big burrito and a salad that came with an avocado dressing.  The dressing was good too ( as I was dipping my fries in it :P) The watress was great and loved interacting with us. she really made the meal awesome. the portions are big so we had leftovers which I ended up devouring later that night."}
{"text":"Before a trip to the mall on Saturday we decided to grab a quick lunch here.  I have only ever been to the Providence Rd location and its usually pretty good.  It was slow here but we still waited a bit for a server to come by and we were so thirsty, I hate that.  Once we finally get drinks I noticed my Diet Coke tastes grossly similar to root beer, bleh!!  Have to wait a while again to find out server so I can get a replacement.  For food you get the unlimited chips and salsa.  Chips were good, salsa was a little spicier than I like.  For lunch I had the little borderito w/steak off the lunch menu, it also came w/a salad.  It was okay I needed lettuce and tomato in it or something, it was just a lot of steak and rice.  The side salad was not good, straight from a bag and I kept picking out brown pieces.  Honestly I usually enjoy On the Border, perhaps I need to stick w/fajitas.  Oh they did advertise a blood orange margarita which looked delish, so that is something to go back for!"}
{"text":"Been coming to the Power Road 'On the Boarder' location for over a decade, seems we got to know everybody over the years. Lots of good times!   Solid 4 star food with 5 star service, my favorite franchise in the far east valley.   Well ... franchise's being franchise's a corporate action was bound to happen. With virtually no personal turnover in 10 years, the corporate weenies no doubt cleaned house to make the numbers look better. Only ones left are Larry, Curley, & Moe. (Sorry I couldn't help myself)  But seriously there were only 3 employee's left that we recognized, felt so lost we simply quit going ... can you say ...Boring!!!   Only because our bank is next door did we finally stop by on St Patty's Day around 5 PM.  Surprise, surprise we got a decent hand made Margarita ... OK ... lets stay and eat.  While the happy hour specials are ... & have always been 'seriously' uninspiring,  I'd have to say the 'regular menu' food was back on par.   We've been back 2 more times now and surprise, surprise, each was a 4 out 5 star experience. They say time heals all wounds, not quite sure about that, but at least things are starting to flow again around here.  Hell they even have Don Julio 'Anejo' & Micro brews on tap now.  A revamped Happy Hour menu with a small discount on the 'good beer's' & margarita's would have my posse back on a regular basis.  C'mon you weenies, loosen up & let the good times roll."}
{"text":"Not really a spot I'd chose, but in this strip of chain restaurants we were short on time and long on hunger. I'd give this 2 star in terms of food.   On the brighter side, service was great and parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"We visited this place with my family in mid-June. The only dish we could enjoy was the Nachos & Salsa. Everything else tasted poor and very had less quantity (unlike other mexican places). We are Vegetarians. Hence, there were very limited options for us. We ordered 4 Entree and felt like all four of them were same. The food was plain, cheesy and blunt!  Beans were served in a super tiny bowl. You never walk into a mexican restaurant to eat blunt and cheesy food with absolutely no spice or chilis.    The only flavorful food was Salsa (Yes, finally some tomatoes).   Our Server was great. She showed great hospitality. When we asked about the food quality, she mentioned that the chef have been changed."}
{"text":"So sad to see this place going downhill. Over the last year the hostesses and servers have really been downgraded. From waiting over 40 mins for a patio table with no one in front of us. We sat outside and watched another group simply walk right onto the patio, we asked the hostess about it and she stated they sat themselves. Once we were finally seated it took a server 15 mins to even greet us. They had brought chips but no drinks. After nearly 15 mins of waiting again we got up and left. It was simply ridiculous! I should mention too, this was middle of the week and we arrived a few minutes before 5pm.  A time prior to that I had to ask a server twice for a refill on my water. After 10 mins or so I went to the bar myself to get my refill. Any time we sit on the patio the servers there are miserable! This is our draw to the restaurant too so it is rather disappointing. Onto our food, it seems I can never get what I order. I ask for two enchiladas, one white sauce and one red sauce. One of each, not to complicated, I have NEVER been served exactly that. Then I am waiting on my food while the rest of my family eats.  It seems like there is extremely high turn over for patio servers as well. Which would explain the bad service. The only reason I gave two stars was the food. While it isn't right, it's always good and so are the alcoholic drinks.  So sad to drive here from San Tan Valley for such disappointment."}
{"text":"This location is amazing! We learned from our phenomenal server, Jon, that this location EARNED the re-model that occurred and it looks incredible! It's super clean, open and bright. I can't wait to come back when it is a bit cooler outside so the quaint outdoor patio can be utilized. Jon was seriously the best server. We were a group of 6 and he got everything right for all of us and was the perfect amount of attentive. He is seriously the reason our experience was so great. We will definitely be coming back and asking to sit in Jon's section."}
{"text":"Returned back to On the Border for some taco Tuesday madness.  I personally believe that the service at On the Border is subpar due to the fact it's associated with Chili's and I've never seen over-the-top service at your local Applebees, Friday's, Chili's, etc.  However, you don't go to these places for the service you go for the price; so \"you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"It's your typical chain restaurant. Nothing flashy, nothing bad. I went with my friend and we ordered a couple margaritas and some beers. Had the guacamole dip and the meat tacos and fish tacos. All were tasty, but I kept thinking about all the calories and fat I was consuming - oh well.   The main reason I went here is I had a $25 coupon I needed to burn through. Service was standard, nothing bad, came when called (sounds like my dog). I would go back if I was with a group and they had to go here or if I was traveling and did not have another option or if I was at the mall and needed a quick Mexican fix.   I prefer local joints like Cantina 1511!"}
{"text":"I tend to avoid suburban chains unless under duress or facing desperation.  As i was on foot in this suburban sprawl, I had very little choice.  Surrounded by shopping centers and every chain restaurant and big box retailer known to man, there was nary a unique independent store or restaurant to be found.  I was truly facing desperation. The lesser of dozens of roadside evils, On the Border seemed the best option in part because it was unfamiliar to me.  Lunch prime hours had just passed, so the place was quiet.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I had been hankering BBQ so I was pleased to see BBQ brisket tacos on the menu.  The lunch portion of two tacos (8.99) came with Mexican rice and black beans, both of which were completely tasteless.  The tacos themseles were good, though the portions were skimpy.  The brisket was ok but not of the highest quality, with a few chewy pieces, but a redeeming aspect was the chipotle BBQ sauce and fried onion rings, all on freshly-made flour tortillas.  The salsa and chips - the best part of the meal.  So, if you want a reliably consistent decent meal at a good price, this place will satisfy you.  For me, if desperation strikes again in a similar suburban wasteland, Ill try the enchilada combo."}
{"text":"Ordered an empanada platter for mother's day,  and it was delicious! Looked great and tasted even better! Plus it was ready on time for me, yay!   This is one of my favorite mexican restaurants, with really great service and great prices!"}
{"text":"Great food. DO NOT USE UBER EATS FOR THIS RESTAURANT. Had a terrible experience where Uber just said the restaurant cancelled our order over an hour after the initial delivery time. Spoke to a manager who verified it is Uber who cancelled."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch today.   Took my teenager for tacos and our server, Miranda, was just awesome.  She took time out of her day to talk and joke with him and really made both of our days.   And the caramel filled churros she recommended were to die for."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. The food is good, not great. The happy hour specials in the bar are a fantastic value. Service has been good every time. Join the club and they will email you offers quite often."}
{"text":"This place is very good and convenient when shopping at Arrowhead Mall.  I like the salsa, made fresh daily; the corn tortillas made fresh and the flour tortillas (good, but not my favorite).   A little gal named Maria makes the taco shells, the corn and flour tortillas.  We have found the food to be fresh and interesting.  The Margaritas are very good, the black beans better for us than the refried and the fish tacos (on corn tortillas) just plain scrumptious.  These restaurants strive to change their menu with new, creative dishes.  The shrimp appetizer was a meal in itself.  The hostess is charming and all the waiters/waitresses are fun, pleasant and remember you.  That's terrific all by itself.  Try it....we do once a week usually.  Suzi"}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars for the service I just recieved. I come here all the time with my family and today went to have lunch place was not to busy when we got there got sat down hostess was very friendly got out chips from the hostess then just sat and sat. People started to come in for lunch and the waitresses got there drink orders and food and still nothing for us over 15 minutes just sitting there with our menus and not one waitress said anything to us . No drink no I will be with you in a minute nothing!! As I was finally fed up with everyone around us getting there drinks and food orders I left. I told the manager how we were treated and walked out. I have never had such terrible service at a resteraunt. And we eat out every weekend.  They just lost a loyal customer !!"}
{"text":"Despite the crappy reviews, I have to say I'm a fan of this place!  Met a co-worker here for happy hour (which is M-F 3-7p), and was pleasantly surprised by the decent service, cheap drinks ($3.25 mixed well and even less for huge draft beers that the hubby was drinking), and 1/2 price appetizers.  We ordered 2 apps, the Firecracker Stuffed Jalapenos (YUM) and the chicken quesadilla (double YUM).  Perhaps we were just really hungry, but at like $4 each they were awesome!!!  Also, their salsa is no joke.  It's tasty and spicy, just how I like it.  I only wish they had stopped bringing us the \"bottomless chips\" because I just kept eating that salsa all night.  I would say that their salsa would be on my top 10 list...  Hmm, speaking of a list...  Anyway, if you're in the area and are looking for a good, cheap happy hour, give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good, ambience is good... but oh good lord they have dirty cutlery. If they can fix that it will be great dice they are close to the mall which is great. The meal portion is good. They have good margaritas."}
{"text":"Well what can I tell you about this place ?. Well lest start by .. I LOVE IT !!!!. Me and my wife really look forward to the weekend to come to this place . The bartenders are excellent at what they do !! . The food and I'm Hispanic I really like it ! . Now to the drinks !! Again like I said me and my wife look forward for the weekend so this will tell you that we really, REALLY ,LIKE THERE DRINKS !! the herredadura drink is my fav drink here. The restaurant is always really clean and there waiters are really professional at there job . The managers actually take there time to come to the table and ask you how is everything and always with a smile ! A+ place !."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to lunch here since it came highly recommended by a friend.  The place is clean and I was greeted properly at the door.  However, as a single, I was ushered toward the bar. Pet peeve. I spoke up and was shown to a booth.  Service was very slow at first and was told \"Someone will be right with you!\"  No so. Finally a polite server showed up.  Friendly AND a clean uniform.  Ordered Tortilla soup and two cheese enchaladas.  The soup was basically tasteless...more like hot water with a few chips in it. Enchalads Ok, but nothing special.  For poor service and mediocore food I give it three stars."}
{"text":"Take-out works just as well as eating in!  I ordered my usual Fajita Salad w/ steak and it was delicious.  They send you home with plenty of chips and salsa, so you don't miss out on the freebies!"}
{"text":"One of my wife's favorite restaurant.  She loves to eat the salsa and the Guacamole Live (table side) is her favorite.  Made to order with just the right ingredients to taste.  I'm partial to the heart-attack Chili Con Caso, not that it is spicy, but high levels of things that are bad for you.  I usually get the burritos, not much else appeals to me.  The fajitas are so-so, and the other dishes are okay for some variety.  The beef triple sauce burrito is one of my picks."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a lomg time, now we remember why!  Long wait, cold dry brisket tacos, no dressing on my salad.... no server in time to get dressing blah. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years now and it is never a disappointment. The staff is friendly, the environment is tasteful, and the food is incredible. It is authentic and delicious. The last few times I've come here, I've had the pleasure of working with Stevie, Zara, Shaneka and her trainee Tori. They have kept the good impression I have of this place alive. I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I used to come here when I lived on that side of town but moved a couple years ago. I came back with a friend and everything just seemed okay.   Nothing was more than okay. The guacamole was warm(?) But it could've been from the hot plate. So I didn't actually eat it but didn't look fr wish at all.   The taco were fine. Chicken, tortillas, and cheese. The rice was dry. It just wasn't great.   Oh well."}
{"text":"Tonight the food and service was excellent... The new management is making a big difference... We will come back in the near future."}
{"text":"I picked up lunch  and the bartender Andy was very excellent. He is extremely friendly and makes OTB a place worth going to."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is sub par. They were out of Dos Equis draft. This is the third time I've been there that they were out. It's 5:30 on a Saturday. How can you be out of Mexican beer in your restaurant? They leave dirty tables for like 30 min. So cleanliness is an issue when you have like 6 tables that are dirty in the bar area."}
{"text":"Yuck  Two stars because the margaritas were tasty.  The food was horrible.  Everything tasted pre-made, pre-packaged, and horrifically commercial.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"OTB has been consistent the 8 times I've been there. I like sitting in the bar area better because I like glancing at the tv while eating.  There is enough room in the dining area for large groups which is a good thing.  Service has been average- timely, friendly, and professional.  Food is not as spicy as I would like it- but that's ok because I just order a fun drink and that helps out.  I've ordered a few dishes from fish tacos, spinach quesadilla, to appetizers. One thing- dishes come with a lot of food. We always get the leftovers to go. Prices are on level with chain establishments of this kind."}
{"text":"Let me fist say that I do like On The Border. I have had good meals at two other occasions  and everything was great.  Not the case here. The waiter in the bar was a minimalist which is not good when your in the service industry. I'm not sure he's aware what industry he's in.  Food was not good. Black beans tasted like they were poured from a can to my bowl. Barely any chicken in the tacos.  Has to ask my waiter for water and he still couldn't complete the task. Ugh."}
{"text":"Mediocre service, crap food. Water actually tasted of mold. Food came out cold and bland. Server did offer to have it remade but we didn't trust that it would be any better the second time around."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal there yet.  And the margaritas are very good. It's hard to find good restaurants in mesa but this is one of them."}
{"text":"I could be wrong here, but I truly don't think of myself as a snob so much as I have snob tendencies.  For example, if I'm going to a barbecue joint, I'm fine with drinking from plastic cups and eating off of a paper plate, it's part of the appeal.  Something that bugged me about this restaurant is that most of their margaritas and specialty mixed drinks (each around $8.00 a drink) have pictures in the menu to reference.  Each picture shows each drink being served in a bar glass.  Three people at our table were given our drinks served in plastic cups, and not just a regular plastic cup with the restaurant's logo.  I'm talking about the sort of plastic cup that you get a sleeve of at Wal-Mart when you intend to have an influx of guests in your home.  Despite being annoyed by the plastic ware, they have a massive menu of mixed drinks with several that I'd like to try.  That snafu aside, the waiter was friendly, even if he did mess up my order, but he was extremely busy with the Cinco De Mayo crowd.  The food was alright, not the best I've ever head, but not bad by far...though, the queso was delicious.  I'd go back for appetizers and drinks alone.  All in all, not a bad restaurant.  I'll definitely go back when they're less busy and try something different on their menu."}
{"text":"Mother's Day... Very busy. But we sat outside and was served by karrie. Very good service considering the place was slammed. I would consider ordering take- out just to save the $$ for an alcohol bill. Yep we are coming back."}
{"text":"This is mine and my families favorite Mexican food restaurant! Ever since we moved to the area 2 1/2 years ago we found this place and it's a tradition to go every Mother's Day plus every other time we can't decide on something this is our number one pick! I was just here the other day with my two little boys and the service was amazing! They brought my kids dough balls to keep them entertained! They have a great variety and I am always happy with what I order! Oh and the chips and salsa?! By far the best then anyone else's!"}
{"text":"Original Queso dip was good. Service was so horrible we'll prob only ever order the dip again. IF we come back. We ordered unlimited tacos. Took 35mins to get the first two. Another 30 mins to get the 2nd two. And that's was only After we had to flaged down the manager. And they came out cold. Mgr took care of entrees but so what the service sucked. What a waste of a meal time"}
{"text":"Hungry after moving some stuff I came here to fill the void. I had a Negra Especial while waiting and ordered  vegetable and shrimp fajitas . Fajitas were good and tasty and hot when I got home. Price was about $23 with food and beer. Overall a nice spot for some Mexican beer and a bite."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating/ordering here.  I had a gift card and I ordered online.  Why because my kids decided to eat/play at next door Chick Fil A so it was convenient.  They have special parking for to go order pick ups, too.  Service was fair. My order was ready as posted about 20-25 mins after completing my online order.  The menu was extensive and intriguing/different than other mexican restaurants.  I ordered/created the 3 combo deal.  A chicken enchilada which was filled with chicken and 2 fish tacos.  Wow, when I opened my to go bag.  A huge portion/bag of chips! I mean a bowl full that you'd actually get at a table if you ate in.  Plus salsa (which was med spicy) The chicken enchilada was tasty and creamy.  The fish taco was also a good portion and filled with cabbage.  It didn't come with lime wedges but it was soo good and filling that I didn't even finish the 2nd taco.  I think it was also because I finished the refried beans.  I only took a bite of the rice/corn, which was good but I was already full.  So all of this was in my to go bag and all for $12 and some change.  Wow, so much food in comparison to Rubios' prices.  I've got leftovers for tomorrows lunch! I can't wait to try their margaritas next time I eat in."}
{"text":"Wife and I just had lunch here. Amanda C was our waitress (very upbeat and cheerful) and she took great care of us. The food had a great presentation and was fresh. Other restaurants just clump their food together. Our was amazing. Christian the manager was great as well!  Had an amazing lunch. Will definitely come back again!  Thank you."}
{"text":"I've been having difficulty trying to add a review here, because there have been so many good meals I've had there. However, the last time we went, I wasn't terribly impressed with the food. I would have to agree with the other reviewers that it seems to be going down in quality."}
{"text":"Tonight we came here for a friend's birthday party. The place was packed, which was great for a Saturday evening and the Birthday Girl's husband picked a good time to have it. Got right in, was asked for our drink orders and within a minute our drinks were on the table. Everyone ordered their meals while we talked and noshed on OTB's awesome chips & salsa.  I had the Superior Dinner, which consisted of a shredded beef taco, 2 enchiladas (one being chicken with sour cream sauce, the other a cheese with red sauce), a chicken flauta with queso dipping sauce, rice, & black beans. I definitely got my money's worth, let me tell you! The ONLY drawback for me was the fact I couldn't really \"taste\" my food, so I didn't enjoy it as I normally would, all due to my sinuses being irritated from bad seasonal allergies, so my taste buds are off and things are bland to me right now. No way is this OTB's fault whatsoever.   Our wait staff was awesome & despite Shelly's cake being accidentally dropped, everything was fun and we all had a great time. We'll gladly be back here again in the future!"}
{"text":"I love this place...always have, always will!   Each time I've been here, I've had very good service and delicious meals! One year, I even came here for my birthday and that was awesome!   Love the food and staff and will continue to come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"You know, I've  got to agree with Danielle and some other recent reviews. Bordeds has gone downhill.  Still a 3 but weak."}
{"text":"On The Border sent me an email asking me to review my last visit there. Well, the food was good. We went there on Taco Tuesday.  They gave us regular menus when we came in, we had to ask for the menu with the specials on it,  They should be giving you the menu with the specials on it without you asking or it. Maybe, they want you to order from the regular menu!  Anyway, the special menu was disgusting filthy with caked salsa all over  it! YUK! Called a manager over to show him. I believe he said it would be thrown out, but as we were leaving the front hostess was cleaning menus! It looked like that was one of them! When you go into a restaurant dirty menus should NOT be handed to you!!!  Hoping their menus are clean now, if I do go back and a dirty menu is given to me I will walk out! YES, it was that dirty!!!"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant.  Nothing terribly special.  But not bad either.  The chips came out hot.  The salsa was tasty.  We opted for the special all you can eat enchiladas.  They were fine.  Not great.  Not bad.  The consistency of the tortillas was a bit odd.  Not sure how to describe it.  But it was odd.  The black beans are very nice.  In my opinion, better than the refried (but I seldom like refried beans).  The rice had a mild seasoning, but also was nice.  This place is no match for La Tolteca, or a few other places, but it seems to be reliable.  We've eaten at a few other On The Border restaurants over the years, and they have been consistent.  If you have a coupon, there is a special, or something similar, it is fine."}
{"text":"This place seems hit or miss. Last time our meal was two-star. Today it was four.  The chips were hot, the salsa flavorful with just a tiny bit of heat.  We ordered off the lunch menu, and our food came reasonably quickly.  My chimi was tasty, but they skimped on the green chile sauce.  My wife's enchilada combo was very nice also.  Service was speedy and friendly.  A good experience."}
{"text":"Good clean restaurant with good food. But the best part of this place is that we have never received poor service."}
{"text":"Great food! Last time we went we had a great server in the bar area. I believe his name is Andrew. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"this is the last time I eat here. last time there was a dirty folded receipt in the chips. taco tuesday get chrispy taco that was only 25 percent full. first time they served enchiladas with melted cheese that sat so long the cheese was no longer melted.  they obviously dont care about the product they serve"}
{"text":"I like On the Border, i just don't love it. Reasonably priced, good happy hour, but the food is just okay. I haven't had a problem, but I think it's a little bland. I go sometimes when I'm in the area, but I don't drive out of my way."}
{"text":"My wife's favorite! And I'm a fan too. One of those Mexican places where everything is good if you have a US kind of food preference.  You can probably find more aim urgently but my mouth doesn't care. Great taco chips, my wife loves their fajitas.  And this one has some nice outside dining - view of the parking lot but you don't notice."}
{"text":"Tuesday night brought my mom for her 74th birthday.  She ordered fish tacos and asked for veggies instead of beans and rice.  Wrong thing delivered.  When correctly received -- it was all cold.  Flavorless.  Disgusting is the best word to describe it.  Waiter had zero interest in making things right.  I tasted it and horrifically bad.  Probably worse bite of food that I've ever had in 22 years of living in Arizona.  Honest truth!  My dinner was mundane but forgettable at best.  Finally just gave up and paid the bill and got out there given it was supposedly a birthday celebration. Ironically waiter gave us the lemons with the bill that were requested much earlier for the fish tacos to try and give them some flavor.  They made their point.  Also nothing like discovering that we were overcharged as well when looking at the bill when I got home."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was my first time at an On the Border restaurant and I was completely surprised at how phenomenal the service is here. Our drinks were always full, we kept getting checked on, and the manager came by a couple times! The steak street tacos are SO GOOD! Highly recommend coming to this location. I don't know how the others are but they treat you SO well here!"}
{"text":"Though the service was achingly, painfully slow- Wait, I should put that in caps, the SLOOOOOOOOW part. I mean, I had to ask a few times if anyone else in our noisy group had their orders taken. Yet, even with that taking place, I will go on record to say that the fish tacos were delightfully crunchy. And the tortilla chips were so very salty, in a good way. Oh, Our server was really nice. She had a great smile for a Monday night.  This is a great place to watch sports. They had at least twenty, maybe twenty five televisions going on at once. And these aren't small TV's, NO, I'm talking big, super-sized TV's. The big suckers. There was one above the bar in my field of vision that I swear seemed as if it were on the edge of our table. It was even more noticeable when one elderly patron yelled out how much she loved near naked men wrestling in near barely there underwear. It changed my thoughts of the UFC fight to be sure.   This place is just fine if you want noisy. This place is okay if you don't really want to have intimate, or semi-coherent, conversations. But I'd only go with a bunch of noisy malingerers and do so for a raucous time. No need to take granny. Unless she likes near naked men wrestling together on the big screen."}
{"text":"Went for my MIL bday the day and received great service and food. Margaritas were spot on and tasty. Mom even got a free dessert and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hmmm, so the good... They serve booze, which is nice because when you're drunk your standards generally lower- just ask What's His Face or my dignity after last Saturday night. Anyhow, do we really need more than one of these abominations in the valley? I think a chain restaurant should only exist when the food is good enough to warrant more access to the greater population. This place does not qualify.   This is the type of place that inspires documentaries about the shocking cheesy grease stuffed pots of lard that Americans shovel in their bellies for breakfast. Deep fried appetizers, cheese on almost everything, and not just enough cheese to add flavor. It's more like a course of cheese with a side of chips.   They do have quote on quote healthy options, but they are boring as all hell. However, I've noticed a trend with AZ Mexican \"healthy options\". They don't know how to make anything healthy without just giving your some meat and vegetables. It's so boring. I wish more places would attempt to recreate dishes with healthy ingredients. It is possible to make healthy tacos among other things.   Anyway, my friend's plate looked like a cheesy greasy mess. As for mine, I wanted a little healthier meal. I ordered 1 spinach enchilada. I was happy with the fresh taste of the spinach, but disappointed that there wasn't any seasoning at all. It tasted like spinach with salt. It's suppose to be an enchilada for christ sake- some chili powder, maybe enchilada sauce... to contradict myself above, cheese would have greatly helped this item. I also ordered one pork taco, or what would normally be called Carnitas... damn gringo ass Peoria. Anyhow, once again, NO SEASONING! Look, I get than many people can't tolerate heat, but you can use spice and add flavor without adding heat. If you are giving me a taco use some fricking seasoning... This should be a given.  Now, a couple highlights: I liked the Skinny margarita. Though this was a \"specialty\" drink,  Margaritas are suppose to be made with Lime juice, not nasty ass margie mix- So, that's a good thing. The bad? Don't measure me half a jigger and charge me 9 bucks! I don't care what the law or code is, make me a drink that tastes good and gives me a little buzz.The other good thing- fresh guacamole... thank God for this. If it had been something nasty I would have had to smack the chef around a little. The last good thing, the fresh tortillas. Though they were a little thicker than I prefer and not traditional corn ones, they were quite lovely."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight and ordered the mango salad. It came with out mangos and a couple other ingredients listed on the menu so I sent it back. The waiter said he was going to take the cost of the salad off my bill, forgot to do so and then deducted the full amount from my gift card.   This experience, mixed with overall slow service is why I give them one star."}
{"text":"On the Border is akin to a burning ship doomed to sink. I used to love this place... Used to. Owned by the same owners as Chili's which also failing in Vegas. We came here tonight for the Monday special (fajitas) and we left with me gagging not once but three times. The chicken was of such poor quality it had more fat and gristle on it than a steak, I actually had to spit a mouthful of that junk into a napkin 3 times! I used to give good reviews here... I'm done with this place"}
{"text":"We stopped here for happy hour as I was lazy and it is close to work. Turns out they have a decent happy hour with assorted drink specials, half off selected apps and a pick 2 food special that runs open to close for $6.99. I selected the Tortilla soup and cheese enchiladas. The soup was good and enchiladas was also good and came with rice and beans. Our server was great and I wish I remembered her name but after a couple of the happy hour Margaritas names escape me."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last night and enjoyed the happy hour specials.  The bar staff were really nice and the food was delicious.  You must try the Watermelon Margarita.  I always try these whenever they are available and they are hit or miss at other restaurants. The Watermelon margarita was so good I had to order a second one.  Admittedly, I am a sugar addict but it also had the perfect amount of tartness to make it amazing.  If you like chicken tortilla soup, you will love their version.  Lots of chicken and avocado.  I know it is a chain restaurant, so what! Stop being so snobby."}
{"text":"Consistent and delicious! Fair prices and fresh. Great service. I order enchiladas every time and have yet to be disappointed. My boyfriend and I are regulars. If you are looking for a quick mexican bite you'll definitely enjoy it."}
{"text":"Depends on who your server is if you will get the correct order.  Most of the time if I get someone who knows me it will be correct.  But somehow the new people can not read the order i pre write for them to make sure they get it right.  I am a picky eater."}
{"text":"Service was so horrible I could have LITTERELY cooked my the food and refilled the drinks with no knowledge of the restaurant buiseness and severed every customer faster then this service. I apologize for the run on sentence. But I'm infuriated as I still waiting for my tab 20 min after completing my meal."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at On the Border tonight.Most importantly,we appreciated our waiter Jeremy.It is rare to find someone as dedicated and customer focused as Jeremy.I expressed to him how his service was highly appreciated and genuine and as expected he was humble. If you ask me,he deserves recognition for his hard work!"}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here on a Friday at around 6. The place was pretty busy and we waited for about 5 minutes for a large table for 10.   The chips and salsa came immediately. We also ordered their Signature Queso, both yellow and white. They are a bit too salty and too rich for me but in moderation, they are pretty tasty.   I had ordered a Sangria because I saw someone having it while waiting for the table. However, due to some mixups, I got one of their margarita drinks. It was all right; way too sweet for me though.  I had Queso Chicken. It was well seasoned with good grilled flavor. However, it was too salty for my taste. I think the chicken by itself would have been fine but the cheese sauce was just too much. I'd order this again but will ask the cheese sauce on the side.   I also tried a bite of the Southwest Chicken Tacos. I thought the crispy onions were a great touch. These came in flour tortillas.   I usually stay away from any restaurants with free refills of chips and salsa because I have no self control and they are my demise no matter how healthy I try to order my main dish. So although I enjoyed my meal, it will be a while before I am back for more! Lol"}
{"text":"The salsa is great, the food is great, the Loaded Queso is AMAZING! Sign up for their loyalty program they send great specials all the time. I drive 8 miles out of my way to eat here regularly and it's worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered the make it at your table guacamole.  It tasted bland.  Needed garlic and salt. I also ordered the mini steak tacos.. Very disappointed because the steak had no flavor. It's like they slapped it on the grill and put it in the taco and that was it. I expected some kind of flavor. Overpriced food and disappointed because it was my first experience with them.. Service not that great either."}
{"text":"Love this place food is so good and Alana was our server and she was awesome! Thanks so much for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Its a busy Friday might..  we got right in and was seated quickly.  Just basic tex mex and good food. Our server Hector was outgoing and professional, very courteous. He has a great attitude!!  All was great."}
{"text":"Great after Christmas meal..  I love the crispy tacos!!! It was quite busy today, we had a fabulous waiter and the lichen was keeping ip.. the tacos were fresh and crispy."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on two different occasions.  The first time was good enough.  Fine food, not great, but good.  The second time we went, we had to leave before even getting chips because of the awful odor.  It smelled like their sewer lines were backed up.  Not good."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Biggest Disappointment again (as I remember from 5 years ago last time we went) ....The Salsa is TOO HOT!.  We love salsa but barely touched the 2 little bowls they gave us.  What a waste.  I'm sure they throw a lot away.  Please lighten up the spice just a bit!!!   Thank you."}
{"text":"I go there for the tortilla soup....they changed the recipe.....not as good..... And server TJ....if you order a margarita....my wife and the table next to us both did....he likes encourage you to put a shot of liquor to make it smoother......what he doesn't tell you is it doubles the price of your drink.....kind of a sneaky way to jack up the tip...."}
{"text":"What else can I say..just a terrible dining experience.  Bad food, bad service, plates being dropped, sour cream on our legs.  Shaking our heads walking out of here."}
{"text":"Management horribly lacking.   Our experience overall at on the border was average... the worst part is the food was pretty damn good. But the wait staff was terrible.. I don't mean my server was annoying or rude... no she was not given the tools to succeed by her manager. We walked in , greeted quickly and took our seat, 5 kindness plus later our server comes up and offers two obviously above 21 year Olds soda... come on missy, upsell! After that I have to inform her we are ready to order instead of her asking.. we get our appetizer, the sampler, and it is damn good! We finished the whole thing and our server didn't ask us how it was once. While waiting for our food we saw our server back in the kitchen scarring down food for all in the dinning room to see. Our entree , the fajitas, we also damn good. Not once did she ask how our food was. Also just and FYI it was happy hour with super great deals! Too bad I learned about from the bathroom stall. Lastly to top it all off when we were leaving we saw our server walk up to a table with a mouth full of food! C'MON MAN!! if the management would get off their ass and train this staff they'd have a great restaurant!   We will be back and I will be speaking to the manager if I see anything else."}
{"text":"Great experience here! Highly recommended. Fajitas were excellent and margaritas were great too, even the house margaritas. Sat in bar area. Loud but fun. Would certainly go back again if we are in the area. Bartender was a great waiter too!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and the take out is great too. Love the guacamole made to order in front of you! The burritos are spectacular and huge! Drinks are reasonably priced and the service is excellent. Never been disappointed at any location I've been to."}
{"text":"Salsa is HOT and I love it, food was above average with large portions so be hungry ! Service was the only weak link but I'm definitely returning !"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had in a long time.  Our server took drink and food order and pretty much disappeared. Came back about 15 minutes later with drinks. 3 waters and ice tea(almost no ice). Asked if we wanted more chips and salsa but never brought them. About 40 minutes after we ordered food finally came. He also brought chips with meal - not sure why at that point. Our drinks had been empty for a while by then and the food was cold. Had to finally stop another server to ask for the manager since ours never came back. They cooked the food again and brought it out hot. For our trouble they bought us dessert. Not really sure what would have been appropriate but that was not it. We love the food but the service is so bad I'm not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we've been back to OTB. They went above and beyond for us. I got the enchiladas and the hubs got the green chili carnitas and both were delicious. We closed out the meal with some sopapillas and honey. So glad we came back after all these years!"}
{"text":"Best part is ordering online, picking it up after work and eating good grub while relaxing at home. I like that while it's a busy location, we don't have long waits for a table when we do decide to dine in."}
{"text":"I really like OTB. No matter where you get it (I travel alot) it's consistent and tastes good. This OTB location is no different and in Vegas it is the only one I know of. Always go with the Ranchiladas. Nice, juicy steak, cheese enchiladas and beans and rice. All you can eat salsa and chips is also great. Top it off with a Kahlua ice cream pie..... yum......."}
{"text":"I love OTB, I mean I really love OTB. I've tried different things on their menu (Carne Asada Tacos, Ranchiladas, Fajitas, etc) but I always come back to the Ranchiladas. It's a hunk of beef cooked the way you want it with two onion/cheese enchiladas with beans and rice. I don't care much for the beans and rice but the combo of steak and enchiladas are awesome. Oh, btw - the endless chips and salsa are amazing. The salsa is really good. Top it all off with the Kahlua Ice Cream pie and you leave feeling very happy."}
{"text":"We had an awful experience here today. Our server was Heather and she was rude from the get-go. My Mom asked if we could get bean dip with our chips and she replied \"Well is isn't free.\" Nobody had asked for free bean dip. She then argued with my Mom about the fact that she had brought us a side of pinto beans and didn't clarify that in fact they didn't even offer bean dip. Not only that, but our food took forever and my Mom had to seek out a manager (she literally walked around the restaurant) to find out what the issue was. While the management was kind enough to rectify the situation by reducing our bill and informing us that the server had been sent home, it doesn't negate the fact that we were there for over two hours and I left with a pounding headache. We all have bad days-trust me, nobody understands that right now more than my family-however you still have to go to work and treat others with respect and professionalism. The food wasn't bad, but the situation was so bad that it left a bad taste in our mouth and we don't ever intend on coming back."}
{"text":"We started going to this place when it first opened and it was great! After a few months, not so great... They have gone through a lot of employees and it seems like most of the good ones are no longer there.- service is SLOW. Unless you are sitting at the bar. The bartender, Melissa? I'm not sure if that is her name, but she is awesome!  Always pleasant, always professional and has our drinks ready when we sit down. We have gone there twice now in the last two weeks and it seems like something has changed - for the positive. The food was better than it has been in a very long time! We hope it keeps getting better & the service eventually matches the food."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday to get some grub before a movie on a Friday night. I was promptly greeted an seated and the waitress I had was very cheery and attentive ! I ordered the stacked nachos but warning if you order these you need at least 2 people to eat these! The portion is huge and the price was reasonable the bolt reason for the three stars is because the nachos tasted okay and kind of bland."}
{"text":"The to go side of the restaurant resolved an issue with my order in a way I have never seen or even heard of before; outstanding customer service beyond expectations!! Going back soon. Food is always delicious. Thank you to the shift manager on Sunday afternoon, you are a leader in your job!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner as part of a mid-week date night with the Mrs. We were seated almost immediately, as there were plenty of open tables and not much activity. We apparently had just beaten the dinner rush. The \"El Jefe\" margarita came highly recommended and with good reason. Made with Patron Silver Tequila, the El Jefe was big and strong, as a good margarita should be. The complimentary chips were hot and fresh and our waitress, Lenore, was on top of her game. I opted for the Tex Mex Cobb Salad. Loaded with fresh ingredients and plenty of chicken, it was a nice break from my typically carb heavy mexican choices. I went without salad dressing and topped it with salsa. It was outstanding. The Mrs. got the Enchilada Suizas. Of course, I had to steal a few bites for Yelp review purposes. The Suizas were delicious and were complimented nicely with refried beans on the side, loaded with cheese. Dinner for two, with the El Jefe's, ran us just under $50.00 including tax. The food was great, the service was fast and friendly and they had baseball on TV. A solid four star performance from OTB."}
{"text":"Met the girls here for lunch this last weekend. It was.... meh... well just chainy. The chips were really crisp, but sort of bland and tasted like they came out of a box that had been sitting on a dusty Food City shelf since 1999. The salsa was okay, but sort of blah and tasted like it was straight out of a jar. The rice was a little too on the al dente side and tasted like it came out of an air zip bag vacuum packed for the Russian space station. And the the beans, well they were barely beanish and tasted like they came out of those old white generic cans with the bar codes that were the only differentiation between products. All in all the food was rather disappointing, even by chain standards. I mean for God's sake, we're in AZ people! I get that you are part of a chain, but have some pride and at least put out a product that resembles it's Mexican origins.  I will say that the wait staff was relatively attentive. Not easy when you consider that we were an intimidating sort of group... and got more so with each drink.  The highlight of the meal was when I looked up and eyed a HUGE chandelier thing made out of empty miscellaneous beer bottles. Sort of sad when the lighting is the highlight of your meal...  If you are looking for decent Mexican food, mueva su coche pequeo someplace else mi amigo!"}
{"text":"Very good. Great wait staff. Fish tacos were solid and delicious - maybe a bit more sloppy than I'd like as the sauce in them was abundant. They have a gluten free and vegetarian menu which was good for the ones in our group as they had specific dietary restrictions.  They don't carry the tres leches dessert anymore  that was the best! Now their desserts are more ...American and not as good as that one was.  If you've never been, it's worth a try. I like it much better than the typical local Mexican joints with the Speedy Gonzalez specials and such , ew. But not somewhere I eat all the time. Overall good- what you'd expect but not beyond. Just On the Border but not over the top."}
{"text":"This place will always be dear to my heart! Love the atmosphere and the chips are huge! Tends to stay a little busy but that's not uncommon for the area!"}
{"text":"We just love coming here the food the service and the prices are good too!! The Cadillac margarita is awesome ! The fajitas to die for. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by for lunch. The service is great as well is the food. Tuesday's is taco Tuesday and you can order tacos for $1.50 each. If I lived closer to this location, I'd come here more often. Wish they had one in Henderson."}
{"text":"What the heck just happened?  I love OTB, come here at least once a month, service is always great, food great.  This time I had to check to make sure I was in the right place.  The chips were stale. Our server SS LL OO WW!!!! I am not a big fan a super spicy food which is why I like OTB.  When I placed my order for the new bowls they have I specifically asked the server what spices were in it and he said the hottest thing was the pico, so I asked for it on the side.  The bowl was so spicy (for me) I started to choke when to grab my drink and it was EMPTY, as I am sitting here dying my son is trying to get the server and he is just meandering around the restaurant.  This trip sucked and I won't be back for awhile.  Step up your game OTB, I'm starting to see a lot of negative reviews."}
{"text":"We decided to invite some friends for dinner at this location to celebrate my birthday because we have always had good food and good service. We arrived early and were seated right away. The waiter brought the chips and salsa and drinks quickly. After we ordered our food, we waited a long period of time. I finally questioned the waiter as to why it was taking so long. There were people that came in after us and already had eaten and left. He said \"I see it up now\". When the food was brought to our table it was room temperature at best. One person sent hers back and all they did was heat it up and send the same plate back out. Two others just sent theirs back as it was awful. The rest of us just ate most of the cold food as we were hungry. The manager came out and apologized and offered to discount our bill. Considering how bad this was, we should not have had to pay anything. After we were done the manager never came back out to make sure we were ok. I felt she was very insincere. My wife and I have been very loyal to OTB, but with this experience we will not go back."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch! Portions were very good and everything tasted fresh. Our server was pleasant and quick with anything we needed. We will definitely stop back by when we are passing through Gastonia the next time."}
{"text":"Never again,  I'll never return to this location and probably won't go to any On The Border again. I can over look the dirty floors, gross tables and mediocre food. But what I won't overlook is the attitude expressed from one of the wait staff when my child (who anyone could identify as having severe autism) was preparing to leave. He was hurriedly moving towards the door and she's looked at him in disgust and exclaimed \"Jesus Christ\". I made her aware that I knew what she did. She used an excuse that she was discussing UNCC. Maybe Jesus just enrolled at UNCC and this was a complete miss understanding.   But I doubt it."}
{"text":"The food was good, there happy hour is pretty good. They forgot about our food but then they were quick to get it out"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  I had the chicken fajitas :)  I had to wait way too long to get a refill and our waiter never offered to refill the chip bowl.  Come to think of it he never asked me what I wanted to drink so I just had water and tried to catch his attention to order an iced tea but that never happened :/   I will definitely return to see if I have better service.  The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner tonight with some friends, server took it upon himself to make fun of me in front of all my friends for being a quiet person (Im partially deaf in my left ear so its hard to tell how loud I'm speaking), then forgot to put in 3 of our 4 dishes, and didnt even apologize for the wait. Really disappointed with how tonight went, especially since I've been here at least 20 times before and never had bad service. Ive worked as a server before and understand things happen, whether it be kitchen being backed up or a large group coming in, But you should always at least apologize and try to rectify the situation, and obviously not make fun of a guest in your work place."}
{"text":"When you're 3 hours away from the actual Mexican border, \"On the Border\" is probably not the best choice for Mexican food. The all-you-can-eat enchilada Monday special drew us in, but it wasn't really about all you COULD eat but rather all you actually wanted to - which wasn't much.  The chicken was tasteless. From the white sauce to the contents of the enchilada, it just tasted like nothing. The red sauce on the shredded beef was better but by no means good. The cheese enchilada was unexciting but the most flavorful (cheese, after all). The spinach enchilada also came up flat.   I'll point out that our server was great - quick, helpful, friendly. But she had horrible food to contend with. Her tip was for her service and not the food as are any points on the rating.  With so many other Mexican options in the area, there's just no reason at all to go to On the Border."}
{"text":"Although I've heard good things about On the Border Mexican Grill but my trip was truly disappointing. The server we had was nice enough, however service was somewhat slow. The ultimate disappointment was the food! I am an avid Mexican food lover so I naturally appalled how that have the food actually was. Honestly the best thing I had were the chips and salsa. My empanadas where lackluster at best!!! They lacked taste and flavor that you expect from Mexican food. Additionally, they were somewhat overcooked. Ultimately my this was so bad I didn't really want to try any of my friends food because I was afraid it might be worse.   Overall I will not return here and I would never ever suggest for anyone to come here. I believe there's so many great Mexican food places available that there's no need to to give On the Border any additional chances. If anybody asks me I would recommend them to almost any other Mexican food place in town!!!"}
{"text":"Typical \"Mexican\" restaurant...the food was pretty good during my first visit. I will go back...I went more for the conversation than to actually experience the restaurant. The service was excellent though and it was a PACKED house when I went."}
{"text":"We had  a gift card from a friend, so we used it to towards a birthday outing.  The service was great, our waitress was top-notch and friendly.  They had great drink specials ($3.50 margaritas, $2.50 beers), and we loved the chips and salsa.  The Queso, however was so salty and watery.  We should have returned it immediately but we were all pretty hungry.  I got the Try 3 - with the fish taco being my favorite.  I was surprised at the tiny tostado.  Hubby got the steak burrito, and while it was huge, the steak itself was pretty chewy and the flavor was boring, too.  I'd return to Don Pedro's or Azteca or any one of the local Mexican eateries next time."}
{"text":"Happy hour at On the Border can not be beat!  The Sangria Swirl and the Watermelon Rita for $4 is the best around.  We also enjoyed the queso guacamole combo for $4.  Reggie, Alyssa, and the other guy at the bar were cool.  Get there early to get your happy hour table in the bar.  4 people, $40, good buzz, great food, we'll be back.  Just make sure yu get a table in the bar, because they will not honor happy hour prices when seated at restaurant tables."}
{"text":"The food is OK but I prefer Garcias.  The shredded beef on the tacos was bland and the beans had a weird taste. The queso was the best part of the meal but it was runny. Maybe they were having an off day but I don't intend to return.  On a side note, the apple crisp was great but that's not what I go to a mexican joint for."}
{"text":"Liked this place. The food was good and the server was really friendly and checked up on us often."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Mexican food I have ever had. We came in and it was not very busy, about 5 on a Tuesday and there was a lot of servers. However, we waited a very long time to even get our drinks. My boyfriend got a peach tea and I got a mango. They both tasted like someone rubbed their sweat on a straw before serving it to us. We both were disgusted and stayed with our waters.  The appetizer we ordered went to the wrong table and we waited at least 25 minutes for it. They brought us the food and we asked where our appetizer was and they said they forgot it. Then our server said he gave it to the wrong table and still almost charged us for it.  They messed up both of our entrees completely. The tacos were greasy and cheese/beef was concentrated only in the middle of the taco. They didn't bring me my rice and beans which were both cold. My boyfriend got a Grande Taco salad with ground beef and literally got just a salad, with maybe a tablespoon of beef on top of it with ingredients he requested not to be in, still in it.  We both work in food service and we both understand how hard it is sometimes. I hate rude people and not necessary complaints. However this literally seemed like none of the workers really cared for their job."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 4 stars because I wanted my review to be read. This location definitely deserves 5 stars.  Why 5 stars? I am vegan and we happened to be served by Christina also a vegan. She suggested some awesome menu items for us and was very engaging. My spinach and mushroom enchiladas with tomatillo sauce were so tasty. My husband loves the stuffed chile rellano dish.  My husband and I visited two times in less than a week. We used coupons and Christina and other awesome staff members made it a wonderful dining experience for us.  We buy our dogfood at Bonapart's Bone-appetite and the personnel and I are always talking how great OTB is and what we ate there. FYI Bonapart's Bone-appetite is planning on moving into the strip mall that OTB is located. This is so convenient.   We highly suggest coming in anytime but particularly when Christina is on duty."}
{"text":"Our experience with On The Border is inconsistent. I've observed that Sunday nights seem to have the lesser experienced or less engaged employees working.   During the week, we seem to get much better service!!   Tonight, it took forever to get our drinks (Water and tea) and chips. We ordered Queso and guacamole and between our waitress and the people that bring the chips, they passed our table with chips over 3 times and failed to actually care or see that we needed chips.   Our waitress seemed bothered that we asked for anything and she went out of her way to avoid us. She got a 10% tip.   The last time we were there and got outstanding service, smiles and a positive attitude and that waitress got a 30% tip.   Wished we had gone somewhere else tonight."}
{"text":"The place was a huge let down! I know it's \"Americanized\" Mexican dining, but come on! It's a shame to say people actually come here. Although today there's about 3 people right now. The food menu was a shame, nothing sounded appealing. So I went with fish tacos since it would be lighter and to be honest...who can mess up fish tacos? Well first the plate came, the tacos were so sad. No sauce, nothing to make it look attractive. Second the fish came all mushed up and placed in the taco like it was scraps. I had 1 of the 3, and it had a bad funky taste with it. Like it wasn't fresh. So automatically I didn't eat the rest. Why risk it? I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs! The beans were dry like if they scraped the pan to get it all. Rice was dry and flavorless. Only thing that was somewhat decent was the drink and that's because they just have to follow steps. I wouldn't come back! There's way better places out there!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm...  Service is going down. We showed up, only 3 other parties waiting, 10 open booths and there is a 15 minute wait...  it's a Friday night, this is when you schedule people to work."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! The chips and salsa are so addicting my husband and I end up getting more cause our girls divulge it! They even end up eating our salsa. My favorite dish is the New Mexico. I love chile rellenos! My favorite alcohol drink is the Sangria Swirl so delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here years ago after this location first opened and wasn't impressed. A couple of weeks ago, I received a gift card for On the Border that allowed hubby and myself to experience two different dinners here within 3 days of each other. For both of those experiences I placed a phone order that I was told could be picked up at the bar. The first time the order was bagged and waiting, but when I went to pay the girl behind the bar says \"don't forget the tip can be written in here\" when handing me the slip to sign. I was naturally going to leave a tip however it was tacky how she mentioned it the way she did and never once did she say hello, thank you or come again. The second pick-up order was worse. This time the order was not ready at the time promised and I had to wait at the bar an additional 25 minutes for the order and the girl working behind the bar (different person this time) could have cared less about my order not being ready, didn't apologize or reassure me when it would be ready and when it came time to pay was when the order was brought out and she only said \"ok here it's ready\" and took the gift card not even offering a receipt or anything about waiting. Customer service is lacking as badly as the quality of the food here.   Free chips and salsa come with each meal. The chips come in a big bag and actually aren't bad. The salsa instantly reminded me of the salsa I had at Chili's years ago and then hubby reminded me that Chili's and On The Border are owned by the same company, so maybe it's the same. Either way, it was no bueno to me. Looked fresh yet had a funky taste.   Baja ($11.99) - Chicken & cheese stuffed fried avocado with ranchero sauce and a chicken enchilada with sour cream sauce. The fried avocado was tasty and it ended there. When it comes to  enchiladas I prefer them with a flour tortilla and I requested this one to be made that way and I was told that wouldn't be a problem yet it was made with a corn tortilla and it didn't even have the sour cream sauce on it as described on the menu. Not only that, but the enchilada was rock hard! The menu says they are handmade, but maybe they are frozen after? The enchilada could not be eaten. The corn had a disgusting flavor. The beans were actually good.   Street-Style Mini Tacos ($10.99 for carnitas) - Three mini soft corn tortillas with carnitas, grilled onion, Jack cheese, avocado, pico de gallo, roasted red chile salsa. Since I didn't like the rice previously I asked for double beans and they at least had cheese on them and tasted good. The tacos looked so good yet were flavorless! First off they only put onions, cheese and avocado on the tacos and forgot to include the pico and red chile salsa which is a bummer because it might have added some flavor to the tacos. The avocados were half frozen WTF?!?!   I ordered hubby a burrito and asked if they could leave the black beans off and the girl who took my order said it would be no issue. When hubby opened up the burrito it was small and cut in half almost like they forgot to include the other half of the burrito. It was also filled with tons of black beans and very little steak. There are certainly better options for legit Mexican food in the area and with all the things wrong I can't see coming back in the future even with a gift card."}
{"text":"I have been to this On the Border about 6 times, most recently around 3 months ago.  This is typical tex-mex food that is done in the same style as Chili's, considering they are sister businesses.  I like everything I've had there.. mainly burritos with chips, queso, rice and beans.    I like the aesthetics of On the Border.  The decor is very colorful and appeasing.    I do recall that a few of the times I went to this location, a floor manager stopped by our table to inquire on the level of service and quality of food.  I have come to expect that level of attention at our upscale go-to joint Fleming's Steakhouse, but to receive it here at a mid-level fast/casual type of place is pretty cool.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years so we thought we give it a try....Stopped in here on Saturday for lunch with my wife. They seated us right away. Hot chips and salsa arrived right away..Yum! Ordered table side Guacamole (the freshest Guac ever). We also had a taco salad and chicken casadilla. All the food was fresh and delicious. The service was quick and very nice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good , the service is good .  We came here at 8.40 pm on a Friday night was so starving but they can get right in and John bring us chip and salsa right a way !! Food come right after 10 minutes later ."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a total of 3 times. The first time everything was great. We ordered the fajitas for two. Portion size was good and service was great. We came back Friday night. Our server was great but our portion sizes were pretty awful. We ordered the fajitas for two again. We received 6 small strips of chicken and 6 pieces of shrimp to split between 2! So we're talking one small chicken breast for 2 people. Not enough meat whatsoever for $30. We both got 3 small tortillas and a tiny scoop of cheese/guacamole/sour cream. Our server gave us 3 extra slices or chicken since the portion size was so small. The entire meal was the size of fajitas for one from chili's but we were charged double for what chili's would charge us. I happen to like the queso primo so I ordered it to go yesterday and I revived only 6 oz of queso, not 8. No scoop of guacamole for it and hardly any meat inside. The queso was runny as well. We ordered table side guacamole and received 3 small scoops the size of what cafe rio would put on your salad and then got charged $10 for it. The manager was not friendly to me. He was not remorseful and he attempted to tell me prices went up and explained to me how expensive it is for avocados. I can get 5 avocados for $6 at Costco that would have made 5x the guacamole I received for $10. After I told him I didn't appreciate him raising his voice to me and not making things right and that I'd like to return the food and get a refund he smarted off to me saying fine! He will just refund me the money and I can just throw the food out. I have yet to see the refund but it may take a few days. Customer service is very important. I fund your restaurant by eating there and my word of mouth. This was handled so poorly. The portion sizes need to go up for what your charging. And he customer should always be right when they feel wronged. My family and friends will not be returning here. I already spoke to friends regarding it who also left a review about the experience. Very unimpressed with the customer service and food portion here."}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre Mexican food. With so many good Mexican restaurants around there's really no reason to go back here. The staff was very nice though and the restaurant was clean. I just enjoy good Mexican food which I did not get here."}
{"text":"I did not like their food at all. Had one dish, sent it back, the second plate was just as horrible. Not close to authentic Mexican food at all. The atmosphere is very nice though. The authentic music made the atmosphere even better! Haven't gone back since I went the first time. Go at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Disappointed....  Please white people, stop trying to do Mexican food with inexperienced \"professionals\" and mediocre management.  Strike 1: Waitress took too long to take our order. Strike 2: Dirty pitcher, dirty glass and didn't pour the drink we had ordered. Simply stated she would be right back and by that time I had downed half my drink waiting for her to take my order. (I was afraid to send back the pitcher of margaritas in fear of fresh spit filled margaritas, with multiple prayers we drank our drink) Strike 3: 2 sets of dirty utensils Strike 4: None of the used/dirty plates/flatware was removed from the table. Strike 5: Waitress walked by several times without acknowledging us or asking if we needed anything else. (Note: BTW we needed something every time since she was not proactive)  Not sure if the management doesn't care ir if On The Border just doesn't train their employees.  One thing's for sure, I'm not coming back to this place.  On a side note, I had to ask a waitress to get the bus boy to clean a table behind me for a couple that was waiting and waiting to be seated(which they finally had to sit themselves in a dirty"}
{"text":"Ate here several times and the only decent food is the rice. The service is good and the margaritas are good, but everything else sucks. If you are looking for good mexican food, this shouldn't be your choice!"}
{"text":"Use to be our favorite place to eat. We've been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and will more then likely never return. We were directed to a booth and sat down. We got chips and salsa within a few minutes. That was the last time we ever were addressed by the staff. We sat down at 5:37pm. After waiting several minutes I tried to flag down anyone who walked by out table and was ignored. Finally giving up we walked out after 37 minutes.  I informer the manager of this to which the only thing he said was \"oh\". While opening the doors to leave informed the hostess to which she looked shocked.  I get busy nights and I get all the various aspects of what restaurants look like on a Friday evening. But to watch everyone around us place orders, get drinks, get refills of drinks, and be halfway done with their meals simply says there is more going on then a busy night. About 4 of the tables around us were sat after us.   The remodel looks nice but maybe there are other changes on the inside that now are effecting your customer base."}
{"text":"I should not even give them one star they are FUCKING horrible. Customer service is horrible!!! Needs new staff and manager. Never again! Don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"I have rarely been to a place where all the food was uniformly awful. This is one.  The first Margarita I ordered tasted like overly sweetened fruit punch so I sent it back after one sip. They sent me a house Margarita next, but it warm, watered down, and again way too sweet. I gave up on drinks and tried to eat the bland jalapeño poppers. I made it through all six, but suffered horribly with stomach pains and worse (I'll leave the details out) for a day.   My wife made it through half of her shrimp fajita before giving up. The shrimp were overcooked and lacking jn flavor. Everything just seemed like it was indifferently slapped together. I could have paid half as much for a better meal at Rubio's.  About the only bright spot was the service, which was always with a smile. In short, if you want a meal that makes you feel like you got food poisoning eat here! At least you will get your food quickly and the waitresses don't make faces when you send it back."}
{"text":"Place online order 3 times and every time I had to go back because it was wrong or missing things."}
{"text":"Gotta love the laid back atmosphere. I normally go after work which seems to be the after work hang out per the crowd around the bar. Who can blame them with the endless chips and salsa and great happy hour drink specials. I had a frozen strawberry margarita and my friend had a strawberry mango swirl margarita both frozen. The drinks are reasonably priced and aren't watered down. They also have a variety of happy hour food items that are available during the happy hour time.  This is a great spot to grab a quick drink after a long days work."}
{"text":"Went in on Monday 11/7 for National Nacho Day. They were running a special for 50% off nachos which were awesome! We also got free queso with check-in. Thank you yelp! Our server was Austin and he was decent.  Started off slow where we didn't get any refills for a long time but they were busy. Once the restaurant slowed down a bit it seemed like he was more on top of it so no complaints.   The queso was very good and a good size to share. Their regular salsa had great flavor but very spicy so the lack of refills at the start was tough since all our mouths were on fire. Then we ordered the nacho specials for our meal! We got the stacked nachos and fajita nachos. The stacked were very messy and tasty. Loved the queso drizzle on them. The fajita nachos were also good but different then your usual nacho pile. They are more like mini tostadas as they load each chip. Therefore they had a lot of beans compared to other ingredient but still very good.   Overall everything was good nothing to exciting but with the yelp coupon and the nacho special we had a good cheap dinner so can't complain! (: I haven't been here in a long time but did notice they have some good daily specials so looking forward to coming back on endless enchilada Monday's."}
{"text":"I was honestly pretty surprised by a few things here! To start the salsa had a nice kick, I hate bland salsa. Chips were warm.  Waitress was very nice and accommodating, although it took quite a long time to get a beer. Had brisket tacos, were pretty good, wasn't a big fan of the bbq sauce they had on them, although the onion rings on top were a nice touch. Re-fried beans were really good! I kept grabbing chips and scooping up the beans. Couldn't stop! On the other hand I didn't like the rice at all. For what they serve the prices are a little high but not too bad. Typical chain fare. You tend to get what you've come to expect, never wowed, and usually not disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is terrible. It is either canned or stale, absolutely somewhere I would not go while hungry.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money."}
{"text":"We like this place for a good bite of Mexican food. I really like their salsa and queso dip. They seem to have a little bit of a New Mexico style to some of their dishes. This trip my mom, wife and I shared the fajitas for 2. We got steak and chicken as the meats. I like the chicken better as the steak can. Be a little tough. It comes with all of the fixings that you would expect for fajitas including your choice of beans and rice. By youngest daughter is a big fan of rice and really like this place because of it. She ended up getting chicken strips and rice. Overall we will keep coming back here because the food is good and fills you up."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate and instead was just super disappointed. My mom was here from out of state and had fond memories of this place from her bday several years before so we came expecting the same. Instead we got a wet seat, cold food, incorrect drinks, and a waitress who just wouldn't do her job. My son and I never got our drinks refilled but she did bring my mom who ordered alcoholic beverages her drinks twice with the wrong order. We also tried ordering guacamole three times but the waitress just walked off as we were still ordering. Same when we tried to pay, we said we didn't want dessert and we wanted to pay, she just dropped the check and walked off. We HAVE to pay at the table. The manager wasn't any better. We will never go here again!"}
{"text":"I went there for chips and salsa and a drink. We saw it was busy so we went to leave and the manager stopped us. We told him we were in a bit of a hurry and it was ok, he insisted it would be quick. He immediately sat is and took our order, chips and salsa and a daiquiri. After 10 mins of being ignored we decided to leave. I wasn't upset about them being busy and that we decided to leave but when he said he would make the service quick, and we wasted 10 mins waiting in their hot enclosed patio with very little air movement."}
{"text":"Bad service seriously makes everything else so much worse.   We had pretty bad service when we went in. My mom got a coffee but when she got it it was cold. We asked to get another and she seemed bothered about it but she brought it. I tried and it was a tad warmer but not hot. My mom was complacent so I didn't mention again.   When I asked what was good she shrugged and said she wasn't really sure. OK maybe not true but you could at least make a suggestion about what people order alot? When my bf asked what a dish came with she didn't know that either. Now that did bother me. But my bf didn't want me to say anything so we didnt.   Overall service sucked. The food took foreverrrr to get out and my bf had to raise his glass to get a refill of coke. How mortifying.   He had to do the same for check. When it came time to clear table,  me and my mom started picking up with napkin and piling plates together. We typically do this, but the waiter/waitress always jump in to help. This lady literally just stood there and waited for us to finished her job and pile it all up and go. How easy.   Food was not good my chicken in chicken enchilada plate was dry. I only picked at it. My bfs fajitas were sizzling for about 5 min after plate came out. No joke.    Never coming here again. Waste of time/money"}
{"text":"We finally got to go back after not having a very good experience.  They made it right and tonight experience was exceptional.  Our server, Erik, was on the spot.  The food was great.  Everything was better than expected."}
{"text":"Came to On The Border on a Friday night after not eating here for years. At the beginning our server was nice and attentive. She got our drink orders right away and dropped off our first round of drinks and took our order shortly after. However the food took quite awhile. I understand it was a Friday night, but the food came out and wasn't as hot as expected. I ordered the classic chimichanga with shredded beef and their melted queso, and ended up getting ground beef instead of what I had ordered. Honestly, the whole thing tasted like a glorified Hot Pocket. I was so disappointed. I do have to say the margarita I got was good, but would have appreciated more check in with the wait staff and an offer for drink refills. Not my ideal Mexican dining experience. :("}
{"text":"We got the mini street tacos with black beans and rice. The steak in the tacos was sooooo good and tender. My daughter got the kid nachos and she couldn't stop saying how delicious they were. It was a mommy daughter date for us and we are very happy with our choice of restaurant. We had a great time"}
{"text":"Had lunch here this week with Rand H.  My chicken fajitas were good.  The rice wasn't crunchy but it wasn't soft either.  The service was pretty good.  Chains are not noted for their over the top food food but they normally produce perfectly edible recipes and decent service and this one provided just that."}
{"text":"Overall just an OK experience.  Our waitree was very friendly and we ordered immiediately.  Our food did not come out for about 55 minutes.  The restaurant was not that crowded so we were very surprised by this.  When the food did come out, it was lukewarm for all our dishes.  We were very disappointed and spoke to the manager. he was very friendly and helpful and he reheated one of our dishes (we were too busy to wait for every dish to be reheated).  He took all the entrees off of our bill which was appropriate.  I'm not sure why the food took so long but the customer service was nice and helped to resolve the situation."}
{"text":"We always pick OTBorder for Mother's Day and Father's Day....guess where I'm not going for Father's Day. It's really sad how far this place has slipped since the last time we visited, and this is not just a one time fluke. You can tell they have made choices as a company to go with cheaper ingredients among other strategies to pinch on profits. The salsa definitely changed for the worse, chicken dishes seemed more \"prepared\" or packaged. Even the salad I had was just really bad, it's lettuce with taco stuff = hard to make that bad I would think. We had fajitas with uncooked (literally cold) peppers and onions to the point where you could hold the fajita pan when served. We had a hair in the food. And to top it off, my Mom ordered a side salad she was told would be .99 extra that never showed up on the table but did show up on the bill for $4.99. When told, the waitress said, \"oh yeah, I couldn't get it to ring up at .99 and my Mgr. told me we would comp something later.\" They ended up taking $3 off the cost of the salad (that never came) so we paid $1.99 for the salad.....that never came. LOL"}
{"text":"Usually come to On the Border when we want to sit outside. Love their patio area.  We always have decent service. The food is definitely chain Mexican food but above those found in Cleveland County. Their chips and salsa are fantastic and my go to is the sampler appetizer plate. Their fajitas are pretty good and margaritas made with plenty of alcohol."}
{"text":"My wife had been out of town all week, I was sick of cooking and eating out.  Amazon offered $10 off to try a home delivery.  We did, and it was perfect.  Not fast as it was a Friday evening, but he got here in 50 minutes.  Food was great, brisket tacos and chicken tacos.  Really good and will do it again."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in the arrowhead area. What I like to do is go there before hitting Harkins Arrowhead Fountains and get the Tortilla Soup and Chicken Tacos. It's like around $9 and fills you up. Busy enough where you can tell that it's good but isn't overly packed. Most I've ever waited was 45 minutes and that was during spring training on a saturday night."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Came quick. The waitress was giving us many suggestions on the vegetation menu, and chose my dish for me (avocado enchiladas, which are amazing btw). Only complaint I would have is that since it wasn't very busy, she kept checking up on us every 5 minutes to the point it was slightly annoying."}
{"text":"Consistently good food...but it is a chain.  I like their Margaritas.  The BF loves the Sangria Swirl Margarita!  Great chips and salsa and good tableside guac.  I love their Cilantro Lime rice, black beans, and the grilled enchilada wrap thing!"}
{"text":"It was a nice place. Clean, pretty. The service was good, and the portions generous. I feel it could have used more flavor in the beans, meat, and rice. We saved the queso by adding some salsa to give it some flavor. It may be what you are looking for, it was quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Definitely not the place to go for vegetarian dishes. Choices include spinach/mushroom enchiladas, guacamole tostadas, and grilled chicken (no chicken for me) or taco (again, no meat for me) salads. I ordered the spinach/mushroom enchiladas and specifically asked if they contained mushrooms. The waitress explained that the mushroom pieces are cooked with the spinach and may \"shrink\". I opened the enchiladas and searched for the mushrooms --- each enchilada had 2-3 pieces the size of pencil erasers. The waitress offered to bring a side of mushrooms; ten minutes later she brought one mushroom that had been cut into six slices (took that long for the cook to grill it she said), but she did credit back the $.99 cents she had to charge me for the mushroom.  One star is for the chips and salsa (which are usually fresh) and the waitress. Honestly, we get better food, service, and prices at Ricardo's with the Restaurant.com certificates."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The food is awesome, and the service is amazing. Our server that we always ask for is Agustin, he is so awesome. He is incredible and he always makes our visit a wonderful experience.."}
{"text":"I came in on a weekday but it still was a bit busy. Kelsey was getting seated left and right but still did amazing. I ordered the beef empanadas as an appetizer and it was amazing. The queso wasn't super cheesy or spicy; it was just right.   I order the lunch combo, two shredded beef tacos. The rice was so so. It was good rice but didn't have much flavor.  My main issue with this meal was the shredded beef. It was SO DRY. I couldn't swallow it without drinking some tea. It had flavor, yes. But with beef texture is so important.   I pulled the manager over and wow what a nice guy. As a server I would love to work for such a caring manager. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Most of the food is very heavy, even the salads. If it's not salad it's very very cheesy, greasy, or loads of meat. I almost always order something from their little health section, where the sides are healthy vegetables and the portion is smaller.  I get tired of this place because of the grease though.  There's nothing to complain about with the service or the facility itself. Very easy to find. It stands out while you drive by on Providence Road because of the brightly lit letters of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had amazing service tonight! Our server was john and he is awesome. The people here are really on their toes and make bomb drinks! Thank you it did not go unnoticed and was very appreciated."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service even on a Friday night. Everything tasted like cumin, even the salsa. I won't return because ofthat but that's just my personal taste."}
{"text":"Just left there  Waited 5 minutes to be acknowledged at the door. When we got seated the waitress keep saying I don't know what's  going on here today and how sorry she was. When she delivered our food after 35 minutes she said they moved your check to the back.  No condiments offered no check back. no manager came and spoke to us. Will never be back"}
{"text":"Wife and I have been coming to this OTB for many years. Never have had a problem with food and service.  As usual the food and service were very good.  Wife had a combo of tacos and enchiladas. I had the flank steak and enchiladas. Dessert was delicious as well."}
{"text":"beer needs to be colder  every time we go it is cold but not much colder than room temp the dosxx tacos are a must jake potter was the best waiter ever there we would wait for his section"}
{"text":"Just went for the first time last night. The service was great. Chips and salsa were good. But the overall quality of the food was low like buffet food quality. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant chain, and I will not be coming back.  Staff was polite and quick. I got the carne asada dinner with refried beans.  Didn't get the beans, had to ask for them. Found out that that meal does not come with tortillas as is usually standard at most mexican restaurants. But waitress brought some out for me anyways. Realized as I was cutting in to the steak that the waitress didn't asked how I wanted it cooked, but came out medium rare.  I do not typically eat medium rare carne asada.  Pretty sure this wasn't even carne asada cut meat. It is flank or skirt steak.  This was definitely neither. Waitress gave bit of attitude when she brought out tortillas per request and the beans that she forgot. \"I double checked with the chefs and confirmed that tortillas don't come with the meal, but brought your some anyways.\" Thank you for making it seem like you were doing me a huge favor by bringing me flour tortillas and beans about 8-10 minutes after our food was brought out previously. Steak was very plain, had no real flavor. Also, didn't realize a regular carne asada steak dinner would come out like they were fajitas, on a sizzling fajita plate.   Only thing I enjoyed about my dinner was the chips and salsa beforehand. And the rice with the meal was okay. Boyfriend who got a slow cooked meat of some sort said his was very plain. But he ate his meal that he thought was okay because he was very hungry. The restaurant was dead at 8pm. Food took quite awhile to get out to us.   I definitely gave our waitress attitude, and I normally don't. But just the way she acted towards me with regards to the tortillas and beans was just silly.   Like I said, this was my first time coming here and my boyfriend and I will definitely not be coming back.   Thank you for the waste of money and hungry stomach upon leaving."}
{"text":"we ordered the tres enchiladas and the chicken fajita salad.   the enchiladas were cooked well as the shells were cooked perfectly.   the salad had chopped jalapeño which gave it a nice kick."}
{"text":"Endless enchiladas are a good deal. My daughter loves the tortillas. Though not amazingly authentic, the food is good, and the restaurant is nice and clean.  Untold this is the last day for endless enchiladas though."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is usually the only time we're here, but a family member wanted to eat here the other day and we said \"sure!\"  Our service in the bar is  very quick and efficient, but it wasn't that way when we came with a group of 8 and sat in the dining room.  I think the server was pretty new and he might have been double sat so he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off.  The fajitas don't come with as much meat, or veggies for that matter, than other Mexican restaurants we frequent, but there is an abundance of side items that come with them.  We really liked the nachos as an appetizer because each chip is loaded with beans."}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour.  You can get a huge goblet full of beer or flavored margarita for just a few bucks.  The bar is almost always full on those nights, so be patient.  You may have a wait a few minutes for a table/ barstool to clear.  Their food is nothing to write home about.  You can definitely get better and more authentic stuff pretty much anywhere you go, but this place is worth it for the happy hour."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. It used to be one of our fav restaurants to go to, but not anymore. Went here tonight, and the wait for the food was really long (45 mins), some of the food was cold, and half of the meals weren't all that tasty. On top of all this, it was expensive. $1 add on for an immeasurably small glop of guacamole, sour cream, and 3 tiny slices of avocado. EACH! At the prices of the food here, that is not acceptable nor appreciated.   To be fair, two of our six meals were really good. Two were pretty good. One was okay, and the 6th was awful.   The service was poor. Long periods of time with no server around."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie....I go here for their large house margaritas that are priced pretty good and eat chips and salsa.  the food here is typical Chile's chain food (pretty sure same company owns em) so I dont call it mexican food my any means. So if you wanna know of  the food....I will pass. But always go for a few drinks and chips and salsa."}
{"text":"On The Border underwhelmed me. The environment was typical of a Mexican food chain. The food was very pricey for the low quality of food. It came out Luke-warm at best. The service was not good. Consistently waiting for refills. I recommend go to Arriba Mexican restaurant that is only a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Good service from Tera. Enchaladas and tamales not as good as my mother-in-law's but were good. Fajitas were mildly seasoned steak -- not merinated.,,which is VERY authentic as normal, everyday mexican family food."}
{"text":"Great food and they always have new stunning drinks this by far tops their seasonal Watermelon Rita..."}
{"text":"Always great food, drinks and service when we come here! OTH is one of our favor our restaurants to dine at.   Tonight's visit was no different but I must apologize to our waitress, Jade. We were on the patio and there was a very rude couple amongst us. Everyone around us could tell and on our way out; I told them they shouldn't be so rude to their waitress. They tried making a scene as we exited and I just wanted Jade to know how sorry I am for putting her in that awkward position. She was great!"}
{"text":"Came over to grab a birthday lunch. Sat outdoors and enjoyed the weather. Combo dinner and fajitas for two."}
{"text":"Last night we decided  to take mom out to dinner. We have been coming  here for a long time and always have  great service. But last night from beginning  to end was a disaster. We arrived at 5pm and only twelve tables  were occupied, so we were seated right away. Our server came and got our drink order we waited  15 minutes  for those. At no time  was chips and salsa  brought  out to our table. We ordered  a bowl of  yellow  queso that was another 15 minutes  for  that. then when brought out   queso and a  small  bowl  of chips. That was gone pretty  quickly , kept looking for our server to get more chips but never saw him until  he brought out somebody's check. By that time the cheese was cold! Then we ordered  our dinners, mom ordered  the sampler plater everything was way over cooked, I had 2 beef crispy tacos and a chili releno, my plate was Luke warm so was food, tacos had no lettuce or tomatoes so I asked for it on the side. He brought  out a small  dish  with chopped  tomatoes  and slimy rotten lettuce. Such a shame  when it has always  been so good."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. This location has excellent service compared to a few of the others."}
{"text":"The serving staff was very nice however it took a while for everything to be delivered. It took longer than normal for us to be able to order and it wasn't very busy in the restaurant. The food was mediocre and not the best. Probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is by far THE BEST Mexican restaurant I have ever been to!! The service is wonderful, and our server Cassidy was great!! She kept tea and water glasses filled, and kept us supplied with chips & salsa! I will definitely come back here, and most certainly will ask for her again!"}
{"text":"It is an ok chain restaurant. Food is usually good and reasonably priced. I do agree with some of the other comment that they could improve on their service. Usually you get some what good service if you sit in the bar or patio, but in the restaurant part they could use some help."}
{"text":"I know, chain tex-mex. Sangria swirl & Guacamole Live are predictably fantastic. Coupled with a hard working, attentive and welcoming staff make cocktails and I fun dinner and a ball game over the shoulder a good night."}
{"text":"Hostess was like a young model - I was stunned/caught off guard by her  looks - she asked \"How many?\" and I said \"two adults and four kids\" - problem is I only have two. LOL. Promptly seated and then Eddie, our server took over. Love their chips and salsa - the chips are like half taco shell size! The chicken taco salad and my onion and cheese enchiliada platter were both only $7.99 each. Huge portions and very good. Love their black beans with queso blanco. Parker turned five so we had the waiter gather his crew for a Birthday Song. Apparently you have to stand up and swirl a red napkin shouting \"Toro, Toro!\" He was brought a complementary brownie sundae. The waiter wanted to make sure that Parker wouldn't be too shy or embarassed before they did their thing; that was a nice touch. Our glasses never went empty. Solid food and effort from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This was an amazing date night! We started with simple chips and salsa. Then when the food came, I was amazed! I had the Baja Combo and a margarita. The Baja is something I have never seen before! It seemed like an egg at first glance, but inside this fried and stuffed avocado was a true delight! It is stuffed with chicken and cheese... yes, INSIDE the avocado! I have no clue how they did this, but it was delicious! It had the creaminess of the avocado, but the rich flavor of the chicken and cheese inside. Along with this came black beans and Mexican rice. The margarita was delicious also and a great way to compliment the flavors as well as cleanse your pallet due to the rich flavors. I can't wait to go back! The staff was friendly, but due to them being busy, less attentive than I would have liked."}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if I could and here's why. The service was horrible I asked for hot salsa and they didn't have it. The chips were dry and I asked for hot sauce he said he was going to bring it but completely forgot about it and I had to ask a second time and they only had one hot sauce that wasn't even hot he also forgot to refill my drink then when our food came they brought my two friends there food and forgot about mine and had to ask what my order was and then they had to go and make it because they forgot about me and the food was tasteless and wasn't good i order fajitas and the amount of cheese they gave me was very minimal and there was a sauce that came with it I didnt know what it was and when I asked what it was they wouldn't tell me and none of the food was  spicy."}
{"text":"We came in around 6pm not knowing there was a 7pm spring training game, place was packed. Luckily we got the last open table in the bar area. Within 2 minutes of sitting down we had our drinks and chips/salsa. Kudos to the staff and management on being spot on the service. as always the food is very good. We've tried many Mexican restaurants only to be disappointed. Now if OTB will come back to Goodyear with the new mall, we'll be happier."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give less than one star I would do it for this restaurant based on the slow service alone. We arrived to an almost empty restaurant and expected quick attentive service. Service was horrible. We were seated in the back of the restaurant near the to go order door. It's almost like we were placed here and forgotten. The food took over thirty minutes to arrive at our table and it was mediocre at best. The service continued to be dismal to the point that it took 15 minutes just to return with our credit card for the bill. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place unless you have over two hours for a meal."}
{"text":"The nachos were excellent as always. Service was spot-on Seth is a great bartender please come see him."}
{"text":"I have had On the Border before at other locales. It's pretty straight forward Mexican. Like last time, I got the Carne Asada. It was good, but not as good as I remember it. A huge meal with rice and beans, the steak seemed thicker and not quite as flavorful as I remember. I do love the chips and salsa and our wait staff was very attentive. One weird part about our experience is being greeted with a \"Are you doing Happy Hour? We didn't even know the specials and apparently where you sit depends on if you can do happy hour. Quite honestly, a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"Service is great the waiter was wonderful heart an appetizer it was way to pepper hot to eat they should warn people is going to burn their mouth off could not is anything afterwards I'm sure it is good to some people however they should warn you that's going to be absolutely pepper hot could not even eat the dish because of the heat index manager was kind enough to give me my money back however I thought the place was overpriced for the quality of the food"}
{"text":"Low wait time. Hostess was blah but bartender waitress was amazing. Great attitude the whole meal. Food was delicious and came out hot. Waitress kept our drinks full the entire time as well."}
{"text":"I'm not big on chain restaurants, but sometimes you have no other choice but to eat at them. My husband and I ate here last Friday as we just couldn't decide on a place to eat and since we were across the street from On The Border we just said \"let's go there.\" We had eaten here once before about a year ago and I remember the food being ok, but not good enough to make me good back sooner than a year later.  I ordered the empanadas (sp?), which were decent, but all I kept thinking was \"I know this is  pre packaged frozen food\" and the queso dip is clearly Tostino's brand dip. My husband tried one of their new chimichangas and he said it was pretty decent.  The one thing I really liked about our visit was their version of a mojito. They call it a Mexican mojito and it was pretty tasty. Instead of rum they use tequila.  The staff was friendly and accomodating. The manager even came by and gave us a coupon for a free app on our next  visit. The place was very busy and loud and one very unhappy child that wanted everyone to know just how unhappy he was.  The food wasn't too bad, but I've had better and I will probably go back mainly to use the free app coupon."}
{"text":"Bryan was the sweetest server ever! So polite and so on top of everything. Refilled our drinks before they even got halfway empty, constantly checking on our food, seriously such an asset to have on the team! It was his FIRST DAY OF TRAINING from a different state and instantly wowed us!!! Thank you so much Bryan! You are an angel :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! Definitely made up for the food which was so-so. I ordered the chicken fajitas and the chicken was a tad dry and the veggies were completely burned, couldn't get them off the skillet that was a permanent home to them I guess lol. The flour tortillas were way thick kind of like a pita bread. I would have preferred corn tortillas if that were an option. I'll still go back because like I said the service was amazing!!!! I just won't be ordering the fajitas."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! I got so sick of waiting, I finally left!! I went up the road to a better Mexican restaurant instead."}
{"text":"I usually don't frequent places like this, especially for the food-it is just too Americanized.  However I had a pretty banging time, it helps when the bartenders and patrons are all full of laughter and very strong margaritas.  Seriously, I would never attempt to have more than one of these things.    There were people of all ages-college to older folks.  I went with a good group of comical friends who kept me entertained, but I couldn't help from overhear this airhead woman jabbering about the most random subject matter from the seven dwarfs to her political views.  It didn't annoy me though, it just made me laugh.  Oh trophy wives are great.    The bartender was a younger guy who kept the drinks flowing with precision and timeliness.  I might be back if I am around these parts again."}
{"text":"The tamales sucked! Frozen tamales are better. The skirt steak was undercooked and made the partner sick.  It was a good reminder as to why we should all avoid restaurant chains. At least I should. I'd rather have tacos and carne fries from any of the ----berto's than go back. Alcohol couldn't even make it better."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. We waited for drinks that were overpriced and ok at best. The \"guacamole live\" had no taste but cost 10 dollars.  Our meals came out at all different times. We waited for another 10 minutes to get soft shells for the fajitas and tacos. The fish taco was dry and very fishy! We will not be back . Would rather eat at taco bell which we are not even fans of. Overall our experience was horrendous! I can't believe this place has been opened longer than a month. Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"So the last 3 times we went to On the Border my husband found metal and a hair in his food. Different locations of course. We had gift cards so we decided to go tonight and take my mom and two boys. The waitress dumped his soda on him, did not get him another until the food came out, messed up his order, then got everyone refills except for him. She didn't come his food, his drink, didn't try to make up for the terrible service. Food pretty good but service was so bad."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for almost 7 years and it's always been good, but this time it seems that everything had changed starting with the menu. We usually get the combination plate, but they've severely limited the choices.   We got the shredded beef taco and spinach and mushroom enchilada combo. When our waiter brought out the plates, we noticed that they are now very small and the portions are even smaller. They now bring the rice and beans in serving dishes. The beans had no cheese on them and they tasted differently than before. Rice was kind of bland. The plates were so small, you didn't have room to even put more than a spoonful of rice and beans on them.   The enchiladas were always so good, but this time there was barely any sauce on them or in them. Mainly just a glob of spinach.   I wii say that the margarita was good, but the music was weird and annoying.   Very disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for Mother's day and it was a great experience! So geat, that we went back for lunch two days later! The Fajita chicken salad is AMAZING! Fresh tortilla chips and amazing salsa. Love this place and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am normally turned off by the Caucasian-Mexican fare, but came to On the Border at the behest of my step-daughter. The hostess was friendly and prompt.  Of note, the phone rang while she was serving us and a male employee, most likely a manager, looked at her with disdain and sarcastically and within earshot of customers said \"don't worry, I'll get the phone\". Crass dude. But the hostess let it roll off and was kind and pleasant. Right away, our fantastic server Tynese came bearing perfect chips and salsa. I don't care for the greasy chips that one may be used to. These were great. So great that we had to add the fantastic queso dip.  To my chagrin, I learned that the restaurant did not have Jamaica tea listed on the menu.  I was excited to have it and was shot down! Our meals came out promptly, and were enjoyed by all. I opted for the Baja, which is a chicken and cheese stuffed avocado, paired with a sour cream chicken enchilada. I was pleasantly surprised. The rice and refried beans were nothing special, but the overall meal was great. Tynese was prompt and polite, and should be considered an asset to your business. We may visit your restaurant again in the future...probably when the east valley is sans snowbirds."}
{"text":"Salsa and chips pretty good. Really enjoyed the sampler platter and all you can eat enchiladas (only $8.99)."}
{"text":"Guac was fresh but very basic and tasteless. Fajitas the smallest portion I've ever received in my life. The tortilla chips were over salted. Overall, busy and overrated and not great. Would go back in a pinch but not as a first choice. The place was clean and service was professional and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was good. Everytime I come here there is never anyone in the front to help you get seated.  It takes a good while at least the times i eaten here and it wasnt that busy.  The service was okay never asked if i wanted a refill.  But the food was good. Maybe i should start going to a different location and see how the service was."}
{"text":"Went here to take my mom to lunch, just curious to try another tex mex restaurant...service was prompt, a bit slow but our service was nice and the complimentary chips/salsa was great. The food was good, not something to go crazy about, my fish tacos were yum but I dunno why they couldn't serve it 1 grilled & 1 beer battered, it has to be either one :-/  but yeah, prices are little high but overall it was ok."}
{"text":"A-OK about says it all.  I can't say much else about this place.  Their food isn't bad, but the problem is that you've got a chain Mexican restaurant in the middle of Arizona.  Now, if I were back in Pennsylvania, I'd be like, \"Yay! I'm going to get some Mexican food at On the Border because it is slightly more Mexican than Chili's.\"  But I'm not.  So go to Los Dos Molinos, or Macayos, or Serranos, or Espos, or Elmer's, or Los Favoritos... Si Senor?  El Zocalo?  Filiberto's?  Nando's?  Seriously..."}
{"text":"Service was really good. Food was very good incuding tacos, enchiladas, Chile rellano, tamales, tostada. Tasty margarita with lots of tequila. Manager and waiter asked about our food and service. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything was great until I saw our waitress sweep up a mess on the floor from another table then swept the seat of the chair.  Oh and she was having a conversation with her manager at the same time, and he didn't say a thing about it! Gross! Is that how they clean off the tables too!?"}
{"text":"I have no complaints. Great family restaurant with healthy options on the menu at a reasonable price. Our server Ryan was very knowledgeable about the menu, he made us feel welcome, and all his suggestions were spot on. When we come back we'll be sure to ask for him!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! There food is always excellent and there use to be a dish that I got all the time when I was here but then they took it off the menu. Well then last time I went it wasn't on the menu anymore and I was so disappointed and I told my waitress and she said they could still make it for me even though it wasn't on the menu anymore! I thought that was awesome! I usually come every Friday with some coworkers for happy hour and the bar staff is always so friendly!!they have great service here"}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, I know..chain restaurant. But come on people, you know that going in, right?  My husband got a 'gift card' from someone for this restaurant so we decided to spend it last night. The place is cheesy from the get go...the crazy psuedo mariachi music was irritating. However, the service was very good and we got exactly what we expected...and a little more.  We ordered house margaritas and the 'made at your table' guacamole. Both were really good. The chips were warm and crunchy and plentiful and the salsa was OK. Good start.  My husband ordered fajitas that were plentiful and 'pretty good' according to him. I ordered the fish tacos...also pretty tasty. Both were served with pretty bland black beans and rice.  Yes, there were lots of kids and noise and please God, turn off that crazy music...but really when you can have a pretty good meal for that $50 gift card I am satisfied."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this location. Hostess greeted us, grabbed menu's and walked away. We assumed we should follow her. Then a guy brought our chips & salsa. Finally spoke as he placed the last item on the table. I think he said, \"here's some salsa\" and walked away.  We debated on leaving. I thought maybe let's wait and see how the waitress is first before deciding to leave. She was great and so was the food. The manager brought our food and he was friendly as well. (We had the fajitas for two)."}
{"text":"We come here often for happy hour, as the prices are way too high outside the happy hour times. You can only get the mini chimis during happy hour, otherwise they are $4 a piece!! The servers always try to get us to add stuff to our margaritas...and succeed. Can't hear any of the tvs in the bar and no close captioning. Chips are great and free, and queso is yummy. My husband thinks their food is too salty, so we usually stick to enchiladas, mini chimis, and chips and queso."}
{"text":"The food here is good and fairly priced -  however the staff leaves a lot to be desired . My husband and I live nearby and visit this location fairly often.  We have noticed, on many occasions, where servers are sitting around at tables and eating and I have even seen servers giving each other back rubs which I feel is very inappropriate in a restaurant. We sat in the bar today due to March Madness and watched a couple at the bar being VERY friendly with each other - kissing, touching. This location is just getting too trashy for us - will spend my money elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"This was a miserable little place.  After hiking up at Red Rock for 4.5 miles I was in no mood to fix dinner.  To our delight we passed this place on the way home.  We used to LOVE eating at OTB back in CO.  But alas, this was no where near what we were used to.  We were seated right away, but the place wasn't busy.  Our waiter seemed to have great potential but that was just an illusion.  I got my food and it was wrong.  Waiter took it back immediately and brought it back out in about 10 min.  So, I sat there eating chips while the rest (5) of my party ate their dinner.  Yay!  Finally my meal is here.  But wait.  What is this?  It's wrong, yet again.  It's just enchiladas...how can you get these wrong...twice?  I didn't feel like messing with it so I ate it...with no enjoyment.  The food was horrible and bland.  This is not what I remembered from CO.    Well, as we suck down our beverages the waiter HEISTS my brother's empty root beer glass for a refill.  Yes, he took it to refill it and NEVER brought it back until 20 min when something was said.  Then my husband and I wait for water refills which never came until we asked for it.  And my poor niece, wanting a strawberry lemonade...never got it...but we were charged for it.  Of course, the hubby made sure the $1.59 lemonade was removed.  We were all speechless.  Normally, we would've spoken to a manager but it was decided that we will NEVER come back to this place.  So, it wasn't worth the effort.  Overpriced/bland food, lousy waiter, and drink robbers!  No, sir.  You can keep this establishment for yourself."}
{"text":"They just remodeled and it's fantastic!! But the best part is Jon, best server EVER!!! Such a nice guy!! Totally takes time to build rapport with his guests, is on top of his game!! Loved this guy. We had a party of 6 people and that's never easy...but he nailed it!! Definitely found our regular spot with our regular guy, Jon!! See you soon Jon...thanks for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed everything we had there, and we love our mexican food.  I wish there was one closer to Henderson, because it is really a drive."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. My experience at \"On The Border\" has been 99% treacherous. There is no wifi, and is very crowded. The servers ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. They even FORGOT one of our meals and we got it only when we were about to leave... and it wasn't all that good of food. They also forgot things we asked for too, like ketchup and dressing. MANAGEMENT went to us and tried to give us other people's checks, because they lost track of tables. They tried to give us other people's else's meals too. The food they had was terrible. I could've been eating cardboard. The wait time was ridiculously long, and it was a generally terrible experience. I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the value of food vs price. I ordered the \"Create Your Own\" any two combo. It was entirely my oversight, but I thought I had ordered \"mini chimis\" ...only to find out it was \"mini chimi\" singular.  I can't say I've ever been to a run-of-the-mill, big chain Mexican restaurant that offered a \"combo\" and would actually bring out one of the main dish items.   Everything says tacos, enchiladas, empanadas...but heads up it is one baby chimi the size of your thumb. $9.79 for one chimi and some beans and soup seems like a poor \"combo\" value.  The waitress was nice and earned the typical 20% tip. However, I can't say I have the desire to return to an On the Boarder. There are so many other choices out here in AZ..."}
{"text":"Located in the Northlake mall area, this is a nice restaurant.  You can eat inside or outside on the patio.  Food is good, nothing extraordinary, what you would expect from a chain tex mex restaurant.  I've been to this location a few times and I would go again."}
{"text":"Slightly pricey for run of the mill Mexican cuisine, but I have truly enjoyed the food every time I have been. Their grilled fish tacos are delicious, and the black beans are as well! Mmmm"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all and the silverware was filthy, the service was very poor and we were left to go for self finding napkins etc. the food seemed like it was a TV dinner and put in the microwave and the waitress never introduced or washed her hands after playing in her hair before serving others! Extremely disappointed, there won't be a next time for me!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that people actually go here with all of the other choices around. If you're accustomed to the spicier flavors found in the southwest, the food at this restaurant will taste bland.   The chips and salsa are nothing special- it's very much like buying a bag of yellow corn tortilla chips and name-brand salsa and putting it in a bowl. I've had the enchiladas here (the sauce is very tomato-y) and a couple of different combination platters with tacos, chile relleno, tostada etc. Overall, everything was very bland and uninteresting. I don't eat rice and beans unless they're particularly tasty, needless to say I took one bite of each and left them alone. I've also had an appetizer sampler with quesadillas, nachos, and taquitos- it was tasty while drinking but for the price, it's a better deal to put such a snack together at home.   The redeeming factor of this restaurant is its patio. It's set up in such a way that very little sun gets in, and there are misters all over. The breeze blows just right so it's always nice and cool outside, even in the middle of the summer.   This might be a good option to come for some drinks and hang out on the patio, but don't expect to be impressed with good Mexican food- you are looking in the wrong place!"}
{"text":"Chain ameri-mex food with decent fresh chips.  The food is just okay, about what you would expect from mass-chain mexican.  They usually have nightly specials and drink specials in the bar.  Average price to expect for an adult getting an entree and a cold one, $15-17.  The best things are the nice big, fresh chips and the ample portions.  Too bad the house salsa tastes like Pace from a jar.  2.5 stars at best but not offensive."}
{"text":"Overall impression, It was good but I wouldn't drive all the way down to the other side of town for mexican food.   My bf and I both ordered from the 2-3 Combo plate section. I ordered the Guacamole Tostados, Brisket Taco and Cheese & Onion Enchilada. He ordered the Shredded Beef Enchilada, Chicken Empinada and Carnitas.   Food tasted pretty good. I love anything with cheese so of course its good to me, haha.   There wasn't much of any service from our waitress."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service.  No complaints.  They are making me write more but I have nothing else to say."}
{"text":"First time going last night Sunday around 9 pm took my mother out for dinner and drinks . First off they were out chicken product and tortillas. Secondly the drink my mom ordered the first time was nothing but juice mix no alcohol and that was 9.99 we both ordered food her meal barely came with chicken inside her food I ordered the ultimate finijas after almost finishing the food it was nasty but was hungry and had pay for it I really didn't want to pay for it and just leave after me and my mom before I can get to the car I felt sick quick and barely made it to my car because my stomach didn't feel right st all I new right then and their it was bad food and food poising . When me and my mom got home we had use the bathroom and was throwing up . That not good I paid for good food I spent 48.95 for. Nothing and I tip the waitress because she did good job. It not her fault the cook and bartender was t doing good job . Now it morning time today and we are still using restroom bad and throwing up definitely food poising going report it I also would like full refund to my card because no customer should have to go threw this at all this was my first and last time here I advise stay away from this place unless you want bad food and food poising .    (Update )  Spoke with the manager Mary and explained to her she was very nice and said she will give full refund and that she will check back in with us later today to make sure we're feeling better thank you Mary means a lot to us that you care and listen to me as the customer"}
{"text":"Justin W. was not joking when you walk in your hit with a bad odor kind of like a dirty mop water odor. This place is true to it's name it's like a Tijuana out house meets taco bell and has a love child"}
{"text":"Arrived after 8, food is not good (shrimp tacos was soggy/ queso was watery) and the drink (cranberry juice and great goose) was weak and watered down. Server was good. Do better!"}
{"text":"Food and service tonight was great. Had some bad experiences with this location in the past but this time it was really good."}
{"text":"First off let me state that if it were possible to give them less than a 1 star I would. I ordered the barbacoa enchiladas with refried beans. I had felt fine all day until this meal. The best thing here were their chips and salsa. The whole meal tasted rather bland. There was no difference in the seasoning at all on the plate. The margarita was decent at best. We only saw the server for orders and the check which by the was just a receipt they had no tray or book to present with it. as I was out on date night I didn't want my girlfriend to worry about how much the tab was.When other tables were checked on regularly in our area. Then when we left we saw a group of about 12 servers just hanging out by the door when we left. Needless to say I won't be back. I could have gone to filabertos spent less and received much better food and service. And to add to this horrible night when I get out of the car to go see a movie I feel nauseous and throw up in the parking lot not even 20 minuets after leaving. Then when I call to inform the manager he seem to accuse me of trying to receive a free meal. If your looking for a good fun dining experience do yourself a favor and go else where. Because I for one am never coming back here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place! I like the fish tacos and the huge watermelon margarita the best! They also have really good enchiladas. Yum."}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened to Mexican food in America....   I used to eat at on the border a lot when I was in North Carolina and Georgia on the East Coast. I think there's only one or two in all of Arizona  I decided to go back and give it another shot... Because I remembered I love the salsa in the queso of dip.  The salsa is still awesome... But that cheese dip is like a goopy mess.   1) salsa is great  2) cheese dip is not good at all anymore.  Actually it's better if you buy it in the grocery store in the jar and then heated yourself. It tasted better than what they serve supposedly fresh  3) the fish tacos were mediocre at best... They fried the fish they didn't offer a grilled option  It's American Mexican food... So it's worth three stars for what it is. But don't text suspect exceptional food. It's also a chain restaurant... However the food here was better than some local Mexican restaurants I've been to"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here was when it first opened a few years ago, I decided to go back and I wish I didnt. The service was mediocre, not great but definitely not bad. The food was horrible. You would think that getting your food 5 minutes after you order it sounds like a dream, when in fact, its not. Everything seemed to be heated over, if it was heated at all. The food had cold spots and just looked unappetizing. My boyfriend ordered his plate with black beans, and got what seemed to be red ones? I ordered a enchilada and taco combo plate. They didnt include sour cream or guacamole so I ordered some one the side and they had the nerve to charge me almost a dollar for each. I know in most Mexican restaurants those condiments come standard with the meal. We ordered two entrees and two iced tea's and our bill came out to be almost $35 without tip. I will definitely not go back and not recommend this place. Too pricey for bad quality."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in this place in 5 years or so, but my impression this place was good so one afternoon I returned. A lot has changed :(  There was 1 server working the entire place when we entered - poor space cadet was absent, unknowledgeable and slow but hey, slack cut since she was alone!  The menu has alot of tex mex favorites, and then some crap that's trying to be new and exciting but fails. We tried the queso and was pleased with it (hard to ruin gooey cheese, si?) but the fajitas my date ordered came out with 0 sizzle and all the wrong condiments (no guac, double sour cream instead of requested opposite). I had a salad with a jalepeno vinagerette and it was OK - I know it had chicken in it and came in a large tortilla bowl but nothing else so I think that says how memorable it was.  I wouldn't swear this place off, but I won't be suggesting we stop at On The Border in the future, especially if you're on a time restriction!"}
{"text":"We tried On The Border for the first time this past weekend. It was an okay overall.  The restaurant is designed cutely, the menu is pretty diverse with the regular Tex-Mex items and some things I haven't seen before.   I had a lunch combo of 3 items for $9.99. The lunch combo is available everyday, including the weekends, which was a nice surprise. It was a great deal because I got a ton of food for that amount.  I went with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup, beef empanadas, and the sour cream chicken enchiladas.  The sour cream enchiladas were definitely the winner of the trio.  My hubby got the carnitas burrito and it was tasty too.  The meals also came with rice and beans.  My kiddo got the kid's quesadilla and it was an awesome quesadilla too!  What really made our experience was our server Dennis.  He had some extra email coupons that he offered to share with us, so we ended up getting one meal free.  He also was really friendly, on top of drink refills, and quite helpful with out toddler.  Yeah for awesome service!  The place is nice for Tex-Mex food.  It isn't my go to joint, but it will be in our rotation of places to visit from time to time.  If you are planning on going, check out their email club for lots of freebies.  Our server said they are always sending free stuff out, so it s definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I must say, I am confused by the negative reviews other people have posted about this On The Border location.  I have never had an issue with the service here and the food has always been amazing.  I was just there last night to take advantage of the cantina happy hour special on tacos.  I got one of each.  One BBQ beef brisket, one Southwest chicken and one carne asada.  Each was excellent.  The carne asada was the slightest bit pink which is just the way I like it.  It was so tender.  I had juices running down my arm.  The closer it gets to the elbow the better.  This made it about 1/3 of the way there. The margarita I ordered, though served in a beer mug (shrug), was good.  It was refreshing.  The chips are thin and crisp.  The salsa is blended and a little bit soupy but with a mouthful of flavor, it matters very little.  I have had a few different enchiladas here.  I have seen some unique chili relleno's that you don't see anywhere else.  It is not just the standard cheese stuffed fried pepper.  The same can be said for the enchiladas.  They are not the standard boring fare you find at some other restaurants.  I love On The Border.  I have always been pleased with the food and service.  Perhaps that makes me the lucky one."}
{"text":"We had a mixup with our food but Andrew definitely took care of it. It was really appreciated and did not go unseen."}
{"text":"Jason our waiter was AWESOME. Best service I have had in awhile . I had the fajitas and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Came to this location of On The Border a couple of weeks ago with a gift card that we had received for Christmas. It was pretty awful. Service was extremely slow for starters and the chips were cold and overly salted.  I ordered a sampler plate with a cheese enchilada, beef taco and cheese crisp. It also included rice and beans. It took about 20 minutes to come out and when it did, it had a very long black hair right on the top of the beans. It was extremely visible and I do not know how no one could have noticed this before it was served. I understand that sometimes sh*t happens, but this was ridiculous and disgusting. I was quite turned off to the whole experience at this point. It took a good 10 minutes to get the attention of our waitress to bring out a different plate. She apologized and was quite embarrassed by the whole situation. She asked if I wanted another plate and I hesitantly agreed. About 15 minutes later I had a new plate. I really wasn't very hungry after all of that but I did try the cheese enchilada which was really just okay. The cheese crisp was semi cold and soggy.  I do not know what has happened lately but this place has gone down hill fast. I will no longer be dining here."}
{"text":"What a sad experience. We stopped by the restaurant tonight around 6:30pm in celebration of our first date 13 years ago at On The Border. It didn't look too busy. The hostes welcomed us, grabbed our menus and started walking us to one of the many open tables. The manager suddenly walked up and told her not to seat anyone including us, told her to tell guests there was a 10 to 15 minute wait. We decided to wait. We waited for 20 minutes and the manager came out a few more times telling the hostesses not to seat anyone. After about 25 minutes we left. For a Friday night they were so understaffed, even for a partially filled restaurant. Kudos for the hostesses who were very apologetic."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on Sunday to celebrate Father's Day.   On Monday, as I was leaving Phoenix to head back to southern AZ, I stopped at On The Border with my 2 children to eat lunch before our long drive home.  Brittany seated us and was also our server.  She was lovely and recommended the specials that day, although we didn't go with those.  I ordered the Queso Chicken which was very tasty and perfectly cooked.  My children got the Fajita Chicken Soft Taco and the Build Your Own Mini Tacos(chicken).  They ate every last bite which is rare when out at restaurants as they are very picky. On the Border definitely measures up to their standards which is hard to come by.  Brittany was very attentive, friendly, and efficient while not overbearing.  She knew just what I needed when I needed it.  One thing that I feel bad about was that I paid with Credit Card and placed the tip on the receipt in the space provided.  However, once the charge went through my account, the tip was never charged to my card...leaving Brittany without her tip.  I called but the gentlemen explained to me that there really wasn't anything he could do.  So I would like the manager and anyone else who might visit to know what a great job Brittany did! Thank you for another great experience at On The Border!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have gone to this On the Border many times and brought lots of friends with us. This experience was definitely subpar. The restaurant was about half full but we waited 20 minutes to be seated. Then we ordered our food and waited 45minutes for it to be served. There were five of us there and three ordered the same. Those meals all came out barely warm and the rice was dry and crunchy. The other two meals were fine and hot. Then we told the waiter that we needed our napkins and silverware. It took at least another five minutes while we sat there waiting for it to come out. Overall this was not a great visit. I don't know if they were short on wait staff or cooks or had no manager present. I gave a three star review partly based on prior visits but this visit is going to make us think twice before returning."}
{"text":"My bartender Stephanie was an absolute STAR! I will be returning not only for the great service I was given but also for the food which was well priced and tasty. The food was a bit slow to come out but in the service industry all customers must take this into account so all in all I am a happy customer."}
{"text":"Never any problems, place is clean and customer service is great! Always good! Queso dip is awesome! The salsas good, could use some more heat though"}
{"text":"The fajitas were delicious! And we also had the sangria which was really good as well. Our server Hallie was really friendly, attentive, and on top of everything. Thank you for making my sisters birthday special!"}
{"text":"Really slow at the bar for happy hour.  Salsa and chips is great but I hate to say the only thing I liked. Quest dip had weird after taste not terrible. The mini tacos soggy broke when I picked them up. The chicken had a terrible flavor as did the beef. Almost one hour for appetizers now that is what I call slow service"}
{"text":"Just came here last night and actually had an amazing server, incredible margaritas and great food. Everything was amazing until I decided to finish the rest of my burrito today and took a bite and damn near broke my tooth. Turns out, what I had bit into wasn't an undercooked bean - it was a rock. I called and spoke to the GM and he said \"oh yeah I've heard of that happening at other stores, but not here. I can re make the burrito if you want...\". People, I'm not looking for a hand out, a gift card or whatever.... but if you are the GM of a store and someone tells you they found a fucking rock in their food, I'd be so apologetic and furious that this happened to one of my customers. The guys tone was so casual and nonChalant that I'm just dumbfounded at how you are the GM of a restaurant.   It's such a bummer that I was so close to having a good experience here and this happened."}
{"text":"How long can a ball roll downhill before it reaches the bottom? On the border has always been one of my favorite restaurants, but over the last couple of years it just keeps getting worse and worse. I walk through the door with a friend of mine and see an empty host stand. I wait for what felt like five minutes of seeing employees checking in on their tables and looking at me just standing there until finally someone shows up to seat me. Please take note and make sure someone is ALWAYS waiting to seat your guests. The service once we got to the table was amazing. Our server was very sweet and constantly checked in on drinks and chips and salsa, which was really the best part of the experience. The thing that absolutely pisses me off is that every single time I come in, I have to send my food back because the kitchen does not understand the concept of what a burrito is. The burritos here look like taquitos, small and skinny, with open ends.   Corporate America is downsizing portions everywhere, but it gets to the point where it's downright disrespectful to charge people for such an embarrassment. I really miss the days when I used to come here and get a large burrito, or even something that could be referred to as a 'burrito' for that matter."}
{"text":"An impromptu dinner out led us out to the OTB (I went ahead and abbreviated it).  Very quiet around 6 pm, and the hostess and waitress were very friendly. The guacamole was yummy and the bottomless nacho chips were just that... never ending!  My waitress did get my order wrong, but, hey chalk it up to human error.   Cute blondes get away with more anyway!  The fajitas were pretty good though on whole.  They also had a mariachi band...  LOUD!  It scared half the people sitting when he belted out the first note of whichever Spanish song they were butchering!  But was good for a laugh!  Not a guffaw, but a good chuckle :)  Price is about average, 15 bucks or so for a meal...  Just bring someone to split the tab with ya!"}
{"text":"Wednesday fajita deal... on the border rocked it tonight!  I forgot to take a picture,  it looked that good. Sorry about that. Right now they also have $2 house margaritas!"}
{"text":"I went there on a date night with my wife. They almost RUINED the experience.  First we get this waitress who spent more time talking to the customers at the next table than re-filling up our glass of water and taking our order. And when she did take our order, we got the wrong thing delivered. We got chicken served when I had ordered vegetarian. UGH!  And then since she was not around (which was the whole time we were there), we had to flag down another waitress to take back our order and get us the correct one. This waitress was nice and even came out to apologize. But our assigned one was nowhere to be found EXCEPT to deliver the bill and pick up the cash/tips. Our food that night must have been comped, but NO!  NOT going there again!"}
{"text":"Thanks for ruining a birthday dinner. Food service was slow, food was cold and tasted awful. They didn't even ask to make things right by remaking the food. Never going back!"}
{"text":"I don't go to this OTB often but when I do they never disappoint. This location has always had exemplary service with very attentive servers. The food is always good, and I love their chips and salsa. The regular salsa is pretty hot so you can request mild if you'd prefer.  As several other posters have noted, they will give you a bag of chips and cup of salsa to take home, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday evening and sat on the patio, nice evening to eat outside. Problem was the table top did not balance, if we did not all keep control of the table the top would move 4 or 5 inches up or down. It was not possible to cut the meat. We asked the server if we could move to another table and she said they were all the same. The food was good the table ruined the experience. Seems like it could be easily fixed if the manangement cares about the customer experience."}
{"text":"Food was amazing ! They serve so much!!! Our server was the best I recommend Miranda hex!!! She went above and beyond. Never had service like this before"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. My husband and I did not get any drink refills. My son got a refill by having a fresh drink slammed down as the waitress walked passed our table; after a manager noticed he needed a refill. The food was ok. If it had been my first time I would not be returning ."}
{"text":"No trained bartender. Put salt , not sugar in cousin's daiquiri. Poor food quality.  Charged for food not receive."}
{"text":"It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close.    Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place.     I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok,  beans  tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables.   Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken. Usually, unless there's an attempt at \"chefing\" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return.  Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating."}
{"text":"Service was great but food prices and portions is another story. We ordered the bowl... should of been a veggie bowl from the start. We had maybe 4 strips of steak and 4-5 strips of chicken. Looking at this made it look like they were rationing out the meat.6.99 for guac that wasn't that good! For the price. Ill skip this place next time and shouldve looked at yelp reviews first"}
{"text":"there is no good mexican food in AZ. This place is by far the best place I've found, the fajitas r good, the nachos r good, the chicken flautas r good. No complaints, I will be back several more times..."}
{"text":"Got here at 9:30 pm on a Sunday expecting service considering their hours of operation stated they were open until 10:00 PM  We walked in party of 6 getting ready to consume in their restaurant but we were quickly informed we couldn't order anything on the grill... it's literallly in your name guys c'mon. ON THE GRILLL??? NOT!"}
{"text":"Fajitas were like jerky tough and dry.  Smallest portion fajitas I have ever got and probably the most I've ever paid.  Could never get a refill on my drink either."}
{"text":"Yummy drinks, great price. Didn't expect this place to be a great joint from the outside looks of the place but solid food and fun atmosphere. Got the \"ranchiladas\" and chicken nachos . Both Delish!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving \"ok\" or less ratings ratings, I just couldn't give it more. I have no complains with their customer service. Staff is super nice and friendly. It was nice getting the Quezo bowl free with Yelp Check, and also getting some chips and salsa as an appetizer. I just thought the food did not have real flavors and it was just way too salty for me. However, my bf and his friend love this place lol"}
{"text":"We decided to give this location 2 chances.  Don't ask me why.  Of all the MX restaurants in the area it was just stupid to think it would improve.  Poor service, poor quality of food (bagged lettuce preserved with only god knows what that caused itchy palms on my hands), very little protein with salads, entrees, over priced, kitchen can't follow orders or they just ignored what and how we wanted our food prepared.  If I don't eat cheese, sour cream, tortillas, refried beans but want extra protein and veggies, make it plain and clear (come on now, how hard is that??), and since I hold so many things I'm not paying extra for what I want.  I'm polite, mannerly but I'm the customer.  If you want my business you'll do what you can to accommodate me needing to be dairy/gluten free.  These aren't foreign situations that they don't have to deal with on a regular business.  I shouldn't have to ask for the manager for the staff to figure it out!  if I could give zero stars, I would, yes that bad!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for over 10 years. Many times I had dinner at this particular OTB . My question is what happen??? The food has gone down hill at a fast pace. Very poor and it's a shame because it was once a decent place to eat. The  service has fallen short as well.  Our order was wrong and we were served half of the dinner. Our waitress blamed it on the kitchen staff and  it should be a known fact they know what's being ordered and on the menu. After waiting we were served something that resembled what we ordered. It tasted horrible under cooked and at that point we decided to pay the bill and leave . Since The manger was NOT to be found. We were asked if they came over and I replied yes just so I could get the bill to  pay and leave. Not only bad food and service all the way around. The table behind us made it game night at OTB playing their music LOUD which made for some interesting cross noise. Would love to know when OTB became a game stop for playing UNO and drinking! But have to hand it to them they weren't on their phones except for the annoying music. The administration offices really need to evaluate this once decent family restaurant. I will NOT be back that's for certain."}
{"text":"There used to be several locations but now it's down to two which I can't understand since they have great homemade tortilla chips and queso. I haven't been in a long time since this location is a little far but they were close on a Saturday night at 8 i almost felt bad. They have great fish tacos and shredded beef the rice and beans are garbage"}
{"text":"For my fill of TexMex this is it.   I haven't been home since Xmas so I do miss, oh do I miss, El Chico's.   For OTB chips = 3.5 as they are served huge (the 1/2 of a tortilla style) and decent texture. No different that the Restaurant style in a bag from the grocery.  Salsa = 4.55. Why? It has bite. Spicy but not overwhelming. It showed me that I've been outside my LA heritage for quite some time as I am losing tolerance for the heat level. But it's cool~ I'll build up my palette again for this spice and Cajun spicy.   Service = 3. What I love: the chip and salsa guys drops his to do as soon as you sit. What I don't like....we were charged for tortilla's. So much for being new and not knowing anything because nothing was explained. But at least things were kind of prompt and not overly hovering.   Dinner = Ultimate Fajitas and that's a 4. To my surprise Shredded pork, zucchini, squash was included. It was almost as if we were having Hibachi but the veggies are cut thicker.   Specials = Yipppeee. Monday - Wednesday catch a deal.   They don't have Coke Freestyle here but seems like only one place in town even does. So, oh well.   The butter isn't real butter. It's margarine. I guess I've been spoiled by WIsconsin for so long that I forget butter may be a treat. It's amazing how I have developed because I can clearly tell the difference between the real and synthetic stuff (I got that from a Dane county farmer \"synthetic,\" lol).   Anywhoo, I would recommend."}
{"text":"We have been to many different \"mexican\" restaurants in the valley, and this one by far is the best, and they have the best deals on town!!!! We went in for the fajita fest deal and it was amazing and was super well priced. Our waitress Kelsey did an awesome job keeping us happy and our drinks were never empty. We will be back to try out other foods here, and will ask for our new favorite waitress :)"}
{"text":"The beer was warm. The place was fairly warm the ac was not on. Waiting a bit longer to get attended by the waitress, she would stop by enough to refill our drinks. Meanwhile the couple on side multiple people would approach them and offer refills. The food was tasteless, the salsa is only tomato and onions it has no flavor. The cheese made me vomit. The chips were very good those I would go back for only. Not recommended for authentic Mexican food than make my own food."}
{"text":"Food is good. Don't come when it's busy or on the weekend, the service tends to be horrible. Especially in the bar  We definitely come for the food, not the service. You can get similar food at Chili's, with much better service.  To be fair, the staff are typically always nice and apologetic about the delays, but it always seems a little understaffed."}
{"text":"Get take-out from here all the time. Convenient parking, consistent food, and huge bag of chips with salsa.  Just check to be sure order is correct before you leave.  Have been enjoying the fabulous Dos Equis fish tacos for as long as I can remember.  The flour tortillas and sauce really set these apart from your run of the mill fish tacos."}
{"text":"We are moving to Las Vegas and were excited to find an On the Border nearby!  This is a great location , clean and well maintained. The Manager came by and welcomed us to Las Vegas.   The chips and salsa are our favorite!!"}
{"text":"Not much to say.  Service awful. Couldn't get no cheese to save my wife's life. Came out twice with cheese.  The soft corn tortillas were crispy.  Salsa taste like spaghetti o's    The warm tortilla chips were good.  Fish tacos. Garbage,   pretty much pick any Mexican place besides del taco or Taco Bell and it will blow this place out of the water    And don't sit on the patio unless you wanna smell sewage all night.   Place was awful."}
{"text":"I have not been to an On The Border forever now.  We were in the area getting some work done to the Lexus so we decided to try it.  I am glad I did.  The salsa is fresh and the service was great.  It was surprising that during lunch it was not busy at all.... sign of the economy times?  who knows, but I enjoyed it ...  I had the steak and enchiladas with rice and beans and my wife had a salad.  We both enjoyed.  Still not worthy of 5 stars, but I will go back and try other things.  It is one of the better Mexican food joints I have tried in a while.  Good and fresh ... thats the main thing right there."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and my parents. The wait was about 20 min, as to be expected on a Saturday night in December near a mall... we went to the bar to grab some drinks, and this is where the 3 stars comes in... we waited for 18 minutes (I shit you not) without being acknowledged by any of the THREE bartenders. Now you're probably thinking the bar was busy, but you'd be wrong. Less than 7 people at the bar, all whom have already received their beverages. The bartenders just sat and talked to one another behind the bar.. never looking around once. I was in true disbelief. I'm not one to call anyone out on their work because I too, was once a bartender.. and I know it's a trying job. That being said... the customers are literally your only priority and that's going to determine how much you take home at night... so why not serve 4 drinks?! Any who.. we got the text our table was ready before anyone even looked our way so we said forget it and went on.. the rest of the night warranted a 5 star review. Waiter was great, food was great. Nice and quick! We had the fajitas for 2 and they were yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently returned to this restaurant after about 10 years from visiting.  The menus and food quality have definitely been upgraded since I had dined last!  Love the chips and guacamole.  The skinny margaritas are a must!!!  We ordered the Fajita Chicken Salad and the Burrito Bowl - both were delicious.  Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"So, we moved across the city, and haven't been here in a year or so....  We were greeted by the friendly staff, and shown to our old familiar tiled table, and we proceeded to have good surprises all evening. The menu changes are awesome, the specials are updated, and our food was great. Btw, they serve the sides family style now, which is a definite plus.   Fajitas were on point, and the perfect portion size.   On top of that the GM is constantly in motion, keeping things on track and customers happy and engaged in conversation.   It's a great place, and we should start coming here more often..."}
{"text":"Our first visit.  Probably our last visit.  It wasn't \"bad\", but with so many other choices in town we would prefer to go elsewhere.  The chips and salsa were good, not great.  Service was ok.  I ordered the chicken street tacos and lost my appetite after biting into a grisely piece of chicken.  The refried beans were nothing special.  Their rice tasted like something out of a box.  Prices and portions were comparable to other Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Husband and I went to this restaurant for first time. We have kind of given up on any good Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.  We checked into On the Border and got a free appetizer of quest dip. I had chili relleno and chicken taco. The chili relleno came out without sauce and I was excited! Because they are supposed to be crunchy. But then.... the chili still had burnt skin on it and was not deseeded so it was bitter. Hubby had a massive burrito that he said was too dry. Soooo, 35.00 later for two meals, one beer and one ice tea, we probably won't go back. :-(  Update: the General Manager/Owner saw our review and was kind enough to give us a gift certificate to try them again. We had the sampler appetizer which was pretty good. Then I had the combo plate, cheese enchilada and chicken taco. Hubby had fajitas, I liked the taco, but enchilada was just ok. Hubby said fajitas were okay. Thanks for paying half of the bill!"}
{"text":"Good corporate Mexican food.  Just returned from the frozen tundra up north, and we were hankering for some Tex/Mex.  The Blonde bodacious waitress from Tejas was spectacular, juggled Us and 5 other tables with ease.  The HOMEMADE flour tortillas are to die for!  Plus the Happy Hour 'Rita with extra tequila for $1 more, is a rocking good deal.  Chips/salsa freshly made, and table side Guac, - Nuff said.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped here before we did some shopping and before our long5 hour drive home.. Ordered two bowls of soup.. That's it.. It's take us over 30 minutes to get our soup.. It's soup!!! Come on son! Need better service!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed dining at On the Border, the last couple of times the service has been a little slow.   The food was not up to it's usual standards. The bar area is fun! the TVs  make the time go by while waiting for the food.   Overall, because we use to be a regular we will go back again and see how it goes."}
{"text":"On The Border is a great place for happy hour and that's why it gets four stars! Their happy hour beers and margaritas are the cheapest I know of so it's a great bang for your buck. The chips and salsa are always great and easy to get carried away with. The rest of the food though... mediocre. Everything on their menu is very cheap in price but that reflects in the quality. Every time I've been in there and tried anything that wasn't a taco I haven't been upset with my meal. But honestly their happy hour makes it worth the visit and you can try some of their menu items yourself for as cheap as $3!"}
{"text":"You walk in and immediately are greeted by several hosts holding the door for you! Lots of great seating both inside and outside. The manager comes around and asks about the food, overall so many efforts are made to get your food perfect and thats great. Free chips & salsa (salsa is chunky w/lots of yummy tomatoes and onions) is served which is fantastic. However, the food still lacks flavor. Also, the beer isn't served cold... come on guys! I'll be honest, 1 star is for the amazing customer service that you'll get. I still have hope that this place can return to its sizzling and flavorful fajitas and food."}
{"text":"Only REAL reason we went there cuz my wife found a $5 coupon. So, we went. I did not have any big expectations and therefore was not disappointed.   This joint is exactly what you would expect from this kind of chain places - Large, busy, kid infested, loud, etc We got this little girl waitress who had other little girl in tow for training. They did OK, if not were very prompt to remove dirty dishes from the table.   Food was alright. Nothing to write home about. You basic run of the mill chain grade Mexican food. Maybe, a bit on the tastier side of the scale, to be honest.   My Corona was good as was my wife's Rita.   All in all, one CAN go there but should one? With abundance of good Mexican eateries around there seems to be no real reason to go to a chain one.   \"Its alrite\"  Eugene"}
{"text":"Thank God we Had a Gift Card  , because We will Never Go there again ..... Prices are TOO HIGH FOR WHAT YOU GET Lunch plate Bean  Burrito $11.00 Crazy made with a med. tortilla  And Don't Waste You time or money  Which I can give 0 Star"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst place I have ever been to.  The food was awful, the service was below standard.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Don't do it is all I can say and if you do I will be the first to say I told you so. Yuck!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, really spot on waitress. Food was o.k., but nothing special. Nothing objectionable, but kind of run of the mill. I ordered the Dos XX Fish taco hoping that was their signature and it was average. I would go back, but there is probably better Mexican food close by."}
{"text":"I had family visiting from out of state and needed a restaurant close by. I never ate here before and my husband insisted we give it a chance (he had gone to them when he lived in Colorado). It was so good that we came back 2 days later. Their chips are SO good. And I got the steak burrito. It was amazing!!! By far my new favorite restaurant, I can't wait to go back. My husband also loved his food as well (I can't remember what he got tho) the service was a tad slow but nothing to get upset about and we were enjoying the food and company too much to care :)  Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Middle of the road Tex-Mex food. You get large portions for good prices. The complimentary chips and salsa are decent- a good heat to the salsa. I've tried a few things on the menu- from their chicken burritos to the steak enchiladas and tacos, served with rice and choice of bean. It's all pretty good- better than some but just not as good as other chains (Abuelos).   They typically have decent beers on tap, so ask your server what's available. Get the Dos Equis Amber with a lime! The margaritas are good- you get what you pay for. The cheaper house margarita is pretty weak, add a better tequila for a tastier drink! This place is definitely kid friendly with a special menu, and there's plenty of room so they can blend in with the white noise. Have fun!!"}
{"text":"This food sucked, it really wasn't all that. Read people that's all I'm saying. Read all the reviews. There saying the same thing. Bad service with bad food equals bad reviews. Not by far my fav place for Mexican food. Roberto's kills this place, on a bad day. Listen and read. Don't come here with high expectations. There are none here..........."}
{"text":"We go here for their fantastic chips and salsa. They have the best chimichangas too. The women love the margaritas while i do enjoy the ice cold beers they have on tap. We will return."}
{"text":"This isn't your average Mexican restaurant. Everything on the menu is pretty unique and you can tell they care about making new menu items, they have good drink specials, and the restaurant itself is clean & nice looking. Even though they were busy, our waiter was super helpful & quick."}
{"text":"This is the second bad experience in a row which actually prompted us to contact management.  The service was appalling.  Never refilled beverages or chips and when they gave my wife the wrong taco it took us ten minutes to get ahold of her to fix it.  The only time she actually talked to us was at bill time.  The food tasted ok but was at best room temp.  Plate was hot, figure that out.  They weren't busy at all.  The worst part of all was a young black haired girl with kinky hair who proceeded to rub her nose and run her fingers into her hair over someones dessert.  This was brought to the attention of the people at the front who really could care less.  We contacted the general manager, Motz, hasn't gotten any resolution.  It is best to stay away from here, I think the health dpt needs contacting."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the 4th of July and we're served by Jeremy. Wonderful service! We recently became vegetarian and are still learning the ropes, and he was very accommodating and helpful in pointing us in the right direction for vegetarian-friendly options. Delicious food and fantastic service. We will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Notice the mixed reviews from all the Yelpers? Well this is a mixed-experience place. You would have to come here wanting Mexican food (Tex-mex to be precise - authentic Mexican food isn't served here), but not expecting to be amazed. And then they will either delightfully surprise you, or let you down completely.   Me and the hubby-wubby-kins have eaten her on date night too many time to count. We first started coming here when we were dating for their $1 Tijuana Tuesday deal. If you sit in the bar area you will be served $1 tacos all you want all night long. Then they have drink specials (we only ever order margaritas, but they have bucket-o-beer specials too) unti 7pm. This is a fantastic deal - you get to choose between chicken, ground beef, or shredded beef and crunchy or soft shell. Free chips and salsa to boot. However, service is hit-and-miss in the entire restaurant and you take an extra risk on such a busy night in the bar area. Was it worth it for the tacos? Hell yes.   After frequenting this place every Tuesday while pregnant with my first son, we discovered their Thirsty Thursdays. Premium tacos for only $2 until 7pm with drink specials (strawberry margaritas are only $2 also - a supreme favorite of ours). You can choose between beef brisket (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - who knew I would like barbeque sauce on a taco???), chipotle chicken, or carne asada (tex-mex. tex-mex. tex-mex. not REAL carne asada - so don't get your hopes up). Also an amazing deal. Since they're less busy on Thursdays, this isn't a bad gamble. Once we did have to sit without drinks for about 20 minutes, but I can let that slide. They're not getting a 5 star rating.   I've eaten in the regular restaurant, and I wouldn't go back to this place if they didn't have the specials in the bar area. The food is overpriced and often bland, though I did get a salad once that I thought was tasty. The service is mediocre at best and for some reason they're super popular \"Guacamole Live\" appetizer (where they make it fresh tableside) has been \"unavailable\" both times I've eaten in the restaurant and wanted it.   If you're looking for a cheap, satisfying dinner Tex-mex style, come here and sit in the bar for their specials. Otherwise, you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my mother for lunch the other day - we had two of the combo meals and some stuffed jalapenos, everything was delicious - a lot of food, great value. The best part of our experience was our waitress, Jazmine, and the manager JJ - When we told JJ what a great job Jazmine was doing he was very engaging and kind. You can tell he is the kind of person that cares about his employees and everyone's experience at his establishment. While the food was great, we will primarily be back due to the outstanding service. Thank you once again!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight for dinner as a late Valentine's Day date and the food was great, as always! The service was a bit slow but it was understandable as it was a busy Saturday night. Our server, Nick, was pretty attentive even while he was training a new server. MY ONLY COMPLAINT is that the woman who was running out the food was wearing a shirt that was so low cut her chest nearly fell out of her shirt as she bent down to put the food tray and the plates down. This is a family restaurant and I was appalled that the manager on duty allowed her to interact with customers in such a revealing shirt. I will obviously be going back for the food and normally great service, but I hope that this isn't allowed again because there are people in the area far more conservative than I."}
{"text":"We are staying at Great Wolf Lodge and ordered takeout last night. The food is good as always, are used to work at a different on the border so I knew what to expect. The only reason this is a four star review is because I got the healthy grilled chicken with salsa Verde, and the chicken portion was much smaller than any piece I have gotten before. My wife got to go Dos XX Fish tacos and they were delicious."}
{"text":"On The Border is low-quality chain Mexican food.  My wife loves Mexican a whole lot more than I do and it's not terribly expensive so we come here a bit more often than I'd care to.  We went this past Saturday after an evening of shopping since it was close and we were hungry.  It wasn't very busy and we were served promptly.  We tore into the first basket of tortilla chips they brought out which were nice and warm, but one of my biggest complaints about OTB is that their tortilla chips are criminally undersalted.  I'm not sure how they warm their chips...it might be in a fryer but I'm dubious, since they weren't greasy at all (which is a good thing).  But if that is how they warm them, they should salt them right after they come out.  It would make them so much more enjoyable.  I got one of their house margaritas on the rocks.  It was surprisingly tasty and probably the best thing I had all evening.  My wife ordered the Border Smart Tomatillo Enchiladas.  About ten minutes after ordering our server came out and said that they were out of the green tomatillo sauce and wanted to know if red tomatillo sauce was okay.  First, I've never seen a red tomatillo, so I'm not sure what was in it.  Second, we should have been notified they were out as soon as the ticket was fired.  This would have given us more time for her to pick a different entree, since she wasn't super jazzed about not being able to get the sauce she wanted.  She said they were just okay.  I was in a taco kind of mood so I got the street-style mini tacos with chicken.  They were unremarkable.  The \"white corn\" tortilla had no discernible corn taste and may as well have been flour.  We both got grilled veggies as our sides.  My wife had gotten the veggie fajitas in the past and the vegetables were remarkably fresh-tasting and well-seasoned.  This time the veggies were duds.  Not only did they taste unseasoned, but they were simultaneously overcooked and cold when they were brought to the table.  Also, it may be a fajitas-only thing, but I was looking forward to the mushrooms they serve with the veggies but only got squash and red peppers.  That's on me.  All in all this is a cheap, cheap-tasting experience.  You know what you're in for when you come here.  I'm still trying to find that satisfying magic bullet that I can rely on when I get dragged here, and I know I'll be back, but the search continues."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. On this visit our server was Lisa and she was very personable and made us laugh.  She also made frequent visits to the table for water, food taste and most importantly, keeping the free chips full. I tried the burrito with  cream sauce. The rice portion seemed small on the big plate but the taste of the food especially the cream sauce was good and in the end I was full. My family opted for the two item  combo plates and they enjoyed the tamales, enchilada, and tostadas."}
{"text":"While this may be a chain restaurant, in the chain land of the world that is Gastonia, I'm a pretty big fan of On The Border.  I usually head here for margaritas, but occasionally grab a bite to eat. They have \"margy\" specials every day of the week & these things are pretty dangerous. You have to watch out as they taste so good you forget just how sly Tequila can be at sneaking up on you. They have a separate bar area that is 1st come 1st served so you don't have to wait on the list to just grab some drinks. I'm also a big fan of their patio area, which is great when the weather is nice.  As for the food, they have a nice little twist on the Mexican theme. It seems more Tex-Mex than Mexican, but they have all of your typical favorites. My favorite dish at the place has to be the Empanadas, which are like little Mexican Hot Pockets. They're just an appetizer, but wow they are good. They are filled with cheese, beans, & some other stuff but it really doesn't matter because they're so freaking good..  I love grabbing some margaritas here, sitting on the patio on a nice day, & munching on the free chips & salsa at the table. And occasionally I order me up some Empanadas which crave my hunger."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited OTB right at opening during the week. Our server was fantastic and very friendly. The lunch menu is priced perfectly and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Enjoyed watching football with our kids at eating a great dinner. Kids love the make your own tacos and ice cream. Combo plate is an easy choice. Family style sides for rice and beans. Good selection of local beer. Margaritas appear to be popular based on those all around us"}
{"text":"Food was great, service too. I took a brownie with ice cream to go, ate it later on that night and it tasted like onions why? So I complained and that was last Friday got a call today from the manager and he actually said to me that it was probably cross contamination yuck!!!!!!! Why would you tell a customer that?"}
{"text":"On the Border is OK.Not bad but not great either. I was there last night meeting up with some friends and I discovered something pretty cool about them. If you order guacamole as an appetizer they come out with a bunch of ingredients including a lot of avocado obviously and make your own customized guacamole just the way you want it! I don't even like guacamole, but that's awesome! They should start doing it for salsa too!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this was a really good experience.  The food was amazing, the drink selection (beer on tap) was great, the waiter was very competent, that atmosphere was pretty good.  Overall, it was alot more than I expected from a chain restaurant.  In the prices were very decent.  I will be back.  Also, I heartily recommend the caramel churros.... :O"}
{"text":"I went for the first time for National Taco day since they had 50 cent tacos and I was not disappointed! The service was great, the restaurant was clean and well decorated, and the food was delicious. Our waiter Charlotte, was amazing!!!! I'm going to start going often and ask her to be my server. I looked at the whole menu just to check the prices and this place is honestly the greatest. The endless enchiladas caught my attention since it's only $10. Try this place out, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening and we really wanted to sit outside to see the lighting storm. It was windy, a bit of dust blowing, but I was surprised that the manager said It was OK. Also, we got in at 6:57 and the waiter didn't see us till 7:03 but still have us happy hour prices on our initial order. We got out fill, satisfied, and the bill was nothing to shed years over. It's sincerely not Mexican food. The hottest hot sauce they had was Chalula  which is a joke, but i would recommend this place to a friend. I'll just remember to bring my own hot sauce next time ;-)"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Thursday night for dinner and ended up waiting over an hour just to get our food! Our soup was delivered cold and we had to ask for plates twice before the waitress was able to bring them so even more food got cold. She seemed unfriendly as if she disliked her job or just didn't care. The bill was discounted however we do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"When an On the Border opened in WA state where I used to live, we followed the herd and had a go. It was delicious then, but this location is not great. Our service was fine and the chips and salsa were good, but  our entrees were strange. I ordered a three item combo because I was really hungry. Mine came out  on two huge platters, one had of them had a chiles rellenos and nothing else . The other platter had two items resting parallel to each other flanked by beans and rice. Everything had a packaged, Campbell's soup taste to it. I got a stuffed avocado that was obviously old. I won't go into detail but everything else tasted like the crummy \"mexican\" food that was passable 30 years ago, now good Mexican food can be had almost anywhere else.  A better option is Leticia's Mexican Cocina."}
{"text":"Man, was I disappointed in this restaurant.   I love On the Border.  Usually when I have gone here in other states, I love it. Not this spot. I always love the salsa and get the XX fish tacos.   First, the wait staff was not very good.  When our food came, we asked for more salsa. That never came.  So we asked another guy and he brought it.    We ordered the queso and guacamole. The queso tastes like cheap velvetta cheese. The guacamole was ok, but too many onions for my taste.  The salsa was still pretty good.   The fish tacos were just not that good.  Too much cabbage and veggies and not enough sauce. They were bland. The rice was very good, but the refried beans were not.   The waiter did ask how the food was and I made a sour face and said, meh...it was ok. He talked right past it to go get our check. LOL!  Guess he really didn't care.   The manager came by because I had a groupon and when he asked, I told him we wouldn't be back.  I told him what was wrong and he apologized and gave us an additional $10 off.   So I will give 2 stars since the manager, rice and salsa were all good. :)  The rest wasn't. :("}
{"text":"I installed the yelp app just to leave a review. When i gazed at the menu i felt excitement from the enchiladas suizas I ordered! To my disappointment they were not what I anticipated! The enchiladas were doused with such an abundance of cheese that it begged a question of if I'd like some enchilada to go with my cheese that i ordered! The food was flavorless and for the price I should of received much more! I have to give this place one star!"}
{"text":"The drinks are fine, my friends really enjoy the specials on margaritas.  I really like the people that work here, in that respect I give this place 4 stars.  This is not my go-to place for Tex-Mex, it is the opposite.  I prefer to drink and socialize here, not order the food.  I recommend you get your grub on somewhere else and then come on in to have a raucous good time drinking and socializing.  FULL DISCLOSURE: My review is biased heavily by my personal relationships.  I wrote a less positive review and my friend, S.W., gave me so much grief I had to change it.  Take that how you like, the people working here were able to ingratiate themselves with my friend and that has to say something about the service."}
{"text":"I used to go here.  My friend loved Tuesdays here and I am torn because most of my positives are the people (who work here and I go here with) but the negatives are the food.  The drinks are slightly better than neutral.  I like the drink specials and I keep getting the Margarita.  Occasionally a shot of clear tequila.  The food: don't get the empanadas.  Dry; overcooked; and lacking any real flavor. The tacos aren't worth the time, they are bland and lifeless.  I tried chicken and beef with the same problem. What should you get?  The white queso and nothing else.  I didn't try any of the non-drinker friendly foods that I eat at the bar.  Never thought about getting an actual meal here.  I would always rather be at Fiesta Maya for that."}
{"text":"Sampler platter is worth every penny!!   Love OTB. I have always had great food and great servce. This evening they were out of a specific item on my platter so they replaced it with something else and offered to give me more of anything else on the plate. I thought that was nice of them because its not always the servers fault the kitchen is out of food."}
{"text":"Great place for some great Mexican food. I have been to both this location as well as the one in mesa and both are great. The food is great and the happy hour options are endless. I love eating outside the few times a year we can and they have a great area. TV's misteres, and heaters. Great for all year round."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and are waiter was great she was on top of everything, this kitchen made a mistake on our order but our waiter got it situated no problem! I was very happy with my portion size their was so much food we had left overs. some of the best Mexican food you'll get an Arizona I highly recommend this spot if your ever in the area hit it up the drinks and food are amazing!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter and her friend for dinner.   Our server (\"Liz Lemon\") was fantastic. She helped make our evening meal a good one.  The complimentary chips and salsa were tasty. The salsa had just enough spice and the chips were crisp and warm. (Though I remember the chips as being a bit too salty and I worried about my sodium intake for the day...)   We all ordered from the \"Create Your Own Combo\" section of the menu.   I ordered chicken tortilla soup (yummy) and two chicken tostadas (also yummy). The tostadas came with black beans and rice. My drink was peach-flavored tea.  Along with the chips and salsa and tea, I was pleasantly full enough to take home leftovers.   Reasonably priced for about $13 per person, including drinks and taxes.  I think I saw a Tuesday special on the small pop-up table advert...  We will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"LIVE GUACAMOLE!!!  ..you must order this.  That's the reason to come here.. Ok, also their brisket tacos are insane.  I would give this more stars, but Im not a huge fan of their tortilla chips and they dont have cheese crisps on the menu.  You can still order one."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here a bunch of times and the service is always good. Most of the staff know me by name and what I like to eat. They don't even give me a menu anymore when I come in.   They have gone above and beyond when I have come in for birthdays and fundraisers and things like that. Kelly, Katy, Melissa, Christian and all the rest are great.   They have the best queso dip and cilantro lime rice along with a wide and diverse menu. I will continue to go back for more."}
{"text":"For service, excellent! I wish i could rememer the server's name! The agave margaritas were soooo good, i wish i had room for more!!  I had the New Mexican plate. I only had room to eat one of the two items on the plate, besides the delicious rice. The item had shredded chicken & green sauce. I just can't remember what it's called--too many agave margaritas!!! Anyway, i took the the other item home which looks like a deep fried jalapeno or pepper! But nonetheless, it still looks good. The chips & salsa at the beginning were good. Better tasting than at most Mexican restaurants--they weren't deep fried in old grease, that's for sure. But the downfall was the price of those tantelizing agave margaritas-- like $10 for one!!!  I'd go back again. I was surprised to see they even do take out & delivery. But my surprise could be due to the tasty, wonderful agave margaritas, which are a pretty pink color!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and where on our to the bar and the hostess tells us we cant go to the bar because there is only one server and i said \"only one server for the whole wait?\" She didn't answer me so we just stood there and waited and waited and are still waiting!!!! We just left. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Out of the two in the Phoenix area, this one is the best! We actually drive 45min to get here because the one near us is horrible. This location has a great atmosphere and the staff attitudes are awesome as well. They really care about their customers and making sure that everything is correct and anticipated things so we never even had to ask for anything. On top of that, our food is always *perfect*! They even go out of their way to keep our toddler happy (not an easy task!). We'll gladly continue driving longer for our OTB fix!"}
{"text":"If you like being ignored and your food/drinks tasting awful, then this is the place for you! We have given this place too many chances and now we just give up. I don't know if we just have bad luck or what, because we're pretty easy going. The service is always horrible and when you have a toddler with you, that makes it even that much worse. I dare you to attempt to talk to a manager while there or get things corrected. You'll get attitude and it'll still be wrong. We actually now drive 45min to another location if craving OTB-  it's like night and day and so worth it! We're actually valued at the other location. Best of luck if you decide to go here. I hope they make some staff changes and  turn things around.  Side note- our daughter is pretty well-behaved. I've worked in restaurants and seen the aftermath of kid meltdowns at restaurants. We go well prepared so that we are not \"those people\", even though kids are unpredictable."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by here before running some errands for some lunch. The restaurant itself was pretty slow so we were seated right away and our hostess was really nice. I had eaten here before and I remember it being pretty alright for the prices.       My friend ordered their stacked nachos as her lunch ($11.99) and I ordered their carnitas chimichanga with red sauce ($10.99). We finished a bowl of their tortilla chips that came with their complimentary salsa and asked for another which we got no problem except they were a salt BOMB. Like, they were inedible.      My chimichanga was pretty good, although very small and served with a huge chunk of raw jalapeno on top. For the price I definitely didn't get the bang for my buck. I then had a couple bites of my friend's nachos and again HUGE assault on my senses with all the salt. We thought that maybe it was the chips again, but after eating just the meat itself we figured out that this time it was the meat that was crazy over seasoned. It was so unpleasant that she didn't even finish them. As for our server, she started out pretty nice but after sitting there for a while her attitude seemed to change like we were more of a nuisance. Plus, when we finally got our bill, on top of the overly priced food for the size, we were surprised to see they charged us $1.49 for one tiny side of sour cream! You've got to be kidding me! We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This was such an amazing experience of exceptional service by our wonderful server Ally and great food. Nice to feel loved and appreciated when we walk into a restaurant, from sitting down to the end of the visit, just an amazing experience with good people. Feeding someone is the most loving thing you can do for someone, and Ally and manager TJ truly made our very stressful day end on an amazing and loving note. Will definitely recommend them, we are both smiling ear to ear how much they made us feel loved."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious.  Restaurant was clean and good environment.  Server was very attentive.  Good food for a good price.  We had the guacamole live and shared the sampler.  It was ample portions."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of On the Border since the first one I ate in about 25 years ago.  I have since tried them in many locations, from CT to TX to NC, and I find the food universally well prepared and tasty.  It was THE place to go for fajitas when fajitas were a new item on the  menu, and they are still predictably good.  Better than most other Mexican places. And the mojitos are fantastic!  Recently they had a menu change, and have narrowed the choices, but added some new interesting dishes.  If you haven't been in a while you might want to check it out.  The guacamole made at the table is still killer...I don't know how they always seem to have perfect, soft avocados, but they do.  I love the chicken tortilla soup, and the taco salad.  Predictable, yes, but still very tasty and satisfying.    The chips are always served warm and fresh, and the hot sauce is just the way I like it.  The new dessert options include a hot, chocolate filled empanada, which was not to my taste, even with vanilla ice cream.  They use dark chocolate filling, which I prefer in most things, but I think for this dessert it is too bitter, and I just didn't enjoy it. There are four pieces, so it's easy to share, if you want to try it.  I've been to this location about half a dozen times now, and I find the service is very good.  My last server was a trained chef, and when I indicated a few things that I liked or didn't like, he was very accommodating about making sure the food was perfect, and it was.  I wouldn't say service is fast, but it's definitely friendly, and they have free wi-fi if you happen to go by yourself at a slow time and want to hang around a bit."}
{"text":"We use to like coming to on the border but we had a experience last time we were in that made my stomach turn. We got there and they were very under staffed tons of seats open but only a few waiters on staff. We waited almost 30 minutes for our drinks by which time we got them they were warm. We waited over a hour for our food at which time I cut open my burrito I always get and the meat was very under cooked I told the waiter he took it back had to wait another 20 minutes brought me a new burrito at which time everyone else was done eating. An when I cut into the burrito it was still undercooked. I spoke to the manager and I refused to eat the burrito I  was very nice to him and explained he was going to get someone sick. He kind of apologized and didn't even offer to take the burrito off our tab. So I told him I refuse to pay for something I didn't eat. At that time he finally took it off the tab and I told him we won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best contemporary mexican food restaurants around. The staff is friendly and fun, the food is filling and delicious. A must for mexican food lovers. Love their fresh guacamole and house margaritas."}
{"text":"We love On the Border and have never had anything that has been substandard at any of the restaurants. It is not the Mexican food we are accustomed to, however, we always enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"We went on Cinco de Mayo and it was a lot of fun and we got some very cool giveaways. The place was packed (as expected) and they had a DJ playing some fun music. Service was very friendly and attentive and the drink specials were great.   However...the food was not very good. Everything was over-salted. I sent my meal back (and I hardly ever send food back) because I truly couldn't eat it. The Manager came over to apologize and to offer me another dish. I was starving and had been there for quite some time at this point so I just asked for a taco and rice. The rice was ok, but the taco was also too salty and couldn't be eaten. They removed the first entree from the bill and didn't charge me for the taco and rice. That was appreciated, but I wished that the food was better so I didn't have to make a meal on chips and salsa. My husband and son also agreed about the saltiness of the food, but they were starving so they ate what they could and then left the rest.   We really like the atmosphere so and we might return next Cinco de Mayo for drinks, chips & salsa, but I doubt that we will return for a meal."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to an On The Border restaurant for the last year and a half. I know it sounds crazy, but I'm still on my quest to find a great taco Tuesday in Vegas. I have been subscribing to OTB's email newsletters for months now, and I finally made it out on taco Tuesday this week 9/30/2014  When we arrived in the cantina area all of the tables that were empty were completely filled be and sticky and gross. We set up the one with the least debris on it and my friend had to go and get some disinfecting  cleaning spray off of the server's station because no one came by to check on us.  I was dismayed when I ordered a margarita at, & I found out that it was pre made from a giant slushy like machine at 7 eleven. It was overly sweet, and it came in a mug instead of a margarita glass. Our server who is obviously over worked told us that we had to order the jumbo margarita in order to get in a margarita glass. Um ok, but who serves a margarita of any size in a beer mug with only 5 ice cubes?   So I ordered another margarita with a \"floater\" of Cazadores tequila, but I never actually got to see the \"floater.\" Apparently they do it all for you. No, thank you!   So the margaritas suck. On to the food:  The chips and salsa were nice and fresh tasting. I order the guacamole which came on a plate that was formed by two ice cream scoops. 0 stars for presentation or even trying to make it look like they made it fresh sometime in the last day or two. It wasn't pretty. Yes, it contains more onions than a normal guacamole, but I do love onions and the flavor was actually decent. Next, we ordered the empanadas with chicken. There wasn't much chicken and they were very very Fri fried, but whatever. That's all I have to say about those  On to the tacos. I ordered the grilled fish tacos which sounded delicious. They came out and lavish presentation with lots of cheese and lettuce and cabbage like I like. Unfortunately the fish was so salty that as soon as I took a bite my heart started hurting from the sodium intake. The corn tortillas were greasy. I asked our server -when I could finally find her again- if she could have them remake the tacos with less sodium.  Finally our server brought out some more tacos, and they were made \"without salt,\" but they still had a great flavor. I guess the grill was already salty enough from all the other overly salted tacos.  If the service would have been better, then I would have been able to overlook  the discrepancies with the food. Unfortunately. All of the servers were too busy and very inattentive. Our server especially acted as if we were a burden every time we asked for something.Thank goodness for the caring busser who finally brought us the water and napkins our server forgot.  At the end of our meal, instead of thanking us, our server told us to order the fish tacos \"without salt\" next time to save the hassle. How about I avoid your section next time instead?   I'm so disappointed!  After a year and a half of anticipation this is what I get. I might go back and give them one more try only because I really love tacos and Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Good decor, free chips and good salsa. Unfortunately, the food is a bit mediocre. The flavors were not there and some of the dishes portions were pretty small. Good customer service but that could also be because they do not have that many customers walking to the door. I ordered the fish taco which was pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the taco salad which had a big fried tortilla and very little salad, i would not recommend it!"}
{"text":"We ate here early in the year and was pleased by the food and service, so we tried it again.  Nice misters on the fringes of the covered patio to help with the heat.  My wife had steak fajitas, and I had a brisket quesadilla, both from the lunch menu.  Chips and salsa were really good, but the main course for both of us wasn't all that good (too much gristle in hers, not enough brisket in mine).  Good service.  Probably would go back, but we've had better."}
{"text":"I've never been to an On the Boarder before- but I was in the mood for Mexican and I was at the mall shopping with a friend -so we didn't want to go too far.   We started with a serving of guacamole - which was meh - it was basically mashed avocado.   Next I had the tres enchiladas - one of each kind (chicken, cheese, and beef). The tortillas were very rubbery and the dish was way too salty.   Not particularly cheap either for a run-of-the-mill lunch, I paid about $18 for my entree, 1/2 Guac, ...and a water.    I wouldn't return here on my own accord."}
{"text":"We've passed by this place several times and never stopped in. But, when you win a $25 gift card, it may be time to check it out. I'm a fan of 2 local spots in Gastonia for Mexican food but becoming familiar with chain restaurants isn't a moral sin, just in case you need something reliable in a small town or something. Nonetheless, I called hubs and told him to meet me there and off I went. After being seating we were almost immediately greeted with some of the best and warmest tortilla chips I've ever had and two types of salsas...mild for me and hot for hubs. The server took some time to get to us on a slow night so the service was kinda meh. After getting our food the only issue I had was with the mushroom bowl looked nothing like the picture, but does it ever? And, there was a fishy taste to the mushrooms...almost as if they were cooked in the same pan as the shrimp, ick. Apparently, we missed the best thing on the menu; the GUAC made fresh at your table. We'll be back for that specifically, and so we can have more of the delicious chips!!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but this place has gotten steadily worse over the last 15 years. It started off as a big hit with lots of people waiting. But unimpressive management of this restaurant has meant it has become a unvisited, uninteresting, American Mexican food bar and grill. For example, it used to be standard that they would make their own tortillas out in an area viewable by the patrons.  They were fresh, tasty and it seemed like they were always looking for ways to bring you more just to give the place a bit of unique flair. The last few years, I don't ever remember seeing that any longer. The appetizers used to be interesting and unique. Now they all taste bland and meh... The people serving used to be positive and upbeat. Now they seem eager to get off shift and ready to push you out the door.  Add all this up, and the higher prices and it doesn't feel like a place I want to bring my family any longer.  There are a lot of little things that make a restaurant an experience that you want to repeat. Somehow, all those little things have been stripped away from this Tex Mex sit-down eatery. Not sure what is next, but if they want to stay afloat they better figure out how to make it fun and interesting to go back here."}
{"text":"If you like TV dinner mexican food then On the Border might be for you. However if you like legit Mexican food dodge this place and head over to somewhere like El Charro in West Mesa or even Matta's for that matter. OTB is awful and Im not surprised this particular location closed."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered a combo plate, blah. Food wasn't anything I would want again. I ate it so it wasn't horrible but really, who wants to come back to blah?  Service was good, place was clean, but I'm not eating either one of those............"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. In Charlotte from Florida to escape Irma. Food was so so and service was bad."}
{"text":"The food was great tonight. I got the green chili carnitas chimi and my husband got the California burrito. I think I liked the California burrito the best. All of their meat had really good flavor. The chips are always fresh and really hot, I like their salsa too. Only reason I'm not giving more stars was being the service was a little slow and when I showed the waiter the yelp freebie they didn't accept it. It was just a cup of queso, but still don't offer freebies if you won't accept them."}
{"text":"Does this place have a manager?  That was our question to each other when leaving.    Four of us were together and stopped at this restaurant.  We really like Mexican food.  Obviously that had to be the case since this was our third day in a row we were Mexican food at three different restaurants!   No one was in line for a table but we stood for quite a while until the hostess showed up to seat us.  Then, it was another good wait until our waitress appeared.   Drinks arrived and so did the chips and salsa.  We ate the chips but didn't care for the spicy salsa.  By now we were wondering if the waitress would return to take our order.  Evidently, she wasn't in a big hurry to do that.  Chips were pretty much gone by the time we saw her again but we finally got to order.  The order for meals consisted of 3 combination plates of cheese enchiladas and one order of fajitas.  It was another very long wait until our meals arrived.  We were expecting sizzling hot plates as we receive most of the time when ordering Mexican food.  That wasn't the case.   Well, the fajitas came in a sizzling hot plate but the cheese enchiladas did not. The refried beans and rice were served family style with the enchiladas on a separate plate but that plate wasn't sizzling and the enchiladas were not good or hot.  The three of us tasted the enchiladas and none of us liked them.  They were warm (not hot), the red sauce tasted burned and the tortilla tasted a little grainy.  We sent them back and asked for a replacement.  One person decided not to chance ordering again but a ground beef taco in a hard shell was requested by another.   By the time that was received at the table, the person ordering the fajitas was finished.  I think that says just how long the wait was.  A taco eventually arrived which was about 1/3 full of ingredients.  It was a soft shell taco and not a hard shell as ordered.  The approximate teaspoon of meat in the taco was chicken and not ground beef.  That was also sent back.  I know they say the third time is the charm but we weren't going to chance it.    We were not offered refills on our drinks.  The water and tea glasses were empty.  One person asked for more tea.  His tea was refilled but none of the other glasses were.  Terrible food, terrible quality and terrible service."}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service. Thank God for the staff because boy do they need them to keep this place running. Food is honestly terrible, I have yet to find something that's actually good there besides beer and churros.  I have gone multiple times starving because I didn't have a chance to eat that day and even then the food isn't good to me. If you're looking for customer service, beer & churros this is your go to spot but if you're looking for food I recommend McDonald's down the street on 75th ave and bell."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night and was very impressed. The last time I had been out to this restaurant was about a year ago and it really didn't seem too great to me, hence the reason it took me a year to come back. Im not sure if they are under new management, have a new chef, or are just improving.   Friday night was of course a busy night so we had to wait about 15 min for a table for 2, not too bad. Our server greeted us right away and we had our drinks and appetizer ordered with in minutes! I love fast service! We ordered the Firecracker Stuffed Jalapeños. I wasn't sure how different they would taste from original Jalapeño poppers, but I am so glad I ordered them! They were delicious! A mix of cheese, cream cheese and chicken stuffed in a jalapeño, then deep fried! Add the cheese dip they give you with the order and your mouth is in Jalapeño heaven! I decided on an appetizer as my main dish also, for I wanted a variety of food dishes, I ordered the Sampler Platter and SO glad I did. It comes with chicken flautas, chicken quesadillas and steak nachos. It's the sampler so it's a pretty large portion, you get a few of each item, the flautas are my favorite. The chicken had a great taste to it, mixed with the different seasoning, cheese and peppers. My bf ordered the chicken chimi, obviously you can tell we like our chicken. I tried a few bites of his dish and it was also pretty tasty. I like my chimis to be very crispy, so was a little disappointed that the tortilla on this chimi was semi crispy, when they aren't crispy they get a little soggy. It was stuffed with chicken, seasoning and peppers, not a bad combination with the rice and beans.  The staff was very friendly, courteous and quick! We had a great evening!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I had been to an On the Border in some time.  Probably years, perhaps decades.  Had it not been a school fundraiser (tell the server, some percentage of your ticket goes to the school), I'm not sure we would have gone.  Even so, I'm not sure if we'll go back.  Everything went well enough, it's just that it wasn't that great.  For the longer version, read on...  We started with the Guacamole Live.  Fancy name (and even fancier price) for the server to create a bowl of guacamole at the table.  It's actually pretty tasty - and I do love guacamole.  But is it worth the price tag?  Probably not.  You can get what is likely the very same stuff, albeit not made tableside, for much cheaper.  Or you can get it elsewhere.  And it's not like you're watching Tom Cruise in cocktail - the server just scoops out avocados and then mashes everything together.  The chips, as mentioned previously, are endless.  And they are more like half a (crispy) taco shell than any other chip you might have seen elsewhere.  Nothing outstanding there.  When it comes to the meal things get interesting.  One of our sons orders a burger from the kids menu.  No explanation - that's just the way it goes.  The other at least tries to get things going with an enchilada of sorts, and it looks pretty good.  But he didn't care for it.  Probably would have been better off with the burger.  We also had a \"three-sauce\" burrito, that really isn't anything special (hey, it's a burrito).  It just had three different sauces on the top - not together, but in three areas.  Finally, I went for the taco melt, because the description sounds good, all bubbly on a skillet.  This really fell down when there was no skillet in sight.  Instead, everything was served in a partitioned bowl (and a really small one at that).  The food was fairly tasty, just odd that it didn't match up to the expectations that were set.  It's also fairly loud at this location, almost like a fiesta is going on - that may or may not be intentional.  At least the service is pretty decent.  Very rarely had to ask for a refill on either drinks or chips.  If this is what you are after, you should be good to go.  Just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Went in for late lunch. Was quickly seated. Location is easily accessible. Menu had allot of different options. Our waitress had great customer service and kept our drinks coming. It took a bit for our food to arrive, but it was deff favorable."}
{"text":"On The Border...seriously sucks when it comes to service. It's bad. Very bad. It's so bad a pack of Hollywood script writers couldn't dream up some of the mistakes I've seen made here. But slap a bowl of salsa and hot chips in front of me and I almost forget that the waitress has been gone for 12 minutes and hasn't taken my order yet. Set a big lunch plate or dinner plate down with a mix of tamales, enchiladas, and chile rellenos and it's gone before I know it.   I hate the service but when I'm at Ann & the 95 and hungry my car keeps finding it's way here. And I have a hunch it will again, and again, and again.   3 stars...gotta drop a star as I'm not patient when it comes to slow service, and another star gets dropped because dang it, I wanted cheese enchiladas and cheese doesn't sound the same as chicken. Yet I sure seem to get a lot of chicken when I go here. Oh and the email sign up deal doesn't get you a free sopapilla until your next visit and they send a lot of email."}
{"text":"I will never eat at On the Border again unless someone else is paying for it.  The service here was terrible and once we were seated our chips were too salty to eat.  The food was nothing like what I was looking for in a Mexican food restaurant.    This was one of the first restaurants I ate at after moving out here a year ago.  I'm still on the search for great Mexican food in the Mesa/Gilbert area.  I know people that really like this place, but I'm not one of them."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last night and big were we pleased. Since it was a nice day out, we sat on the patio. Our server brought us chips and salsa. Their chips are huge, btw, and the salsa is addicting. Our server was very attentive about refilling our salsa. We also ordered the frozen strawberry mango margarita swirl, which was very refreshing and delicious.  My husband ordered the baja which is an enchilada, with chicken stuff avocado which is battered and deep fried and is amazing!! I had the $12.99 combo meal which comes with a soup/salad, entree and dessert. I got the tortilla soup, which was delicious, the grilled chicken fajita and we both shared the brownie sundae. Everything in our meals was perfect. All in all we had a great experience. We will be back to try more stuff but I don't know if I can pass off on the brownie sundae, knowing it's so good!"}
{"text":"Review update because it's much needed. Last few years we've been here we have had horrible service. Horrible food too. But the past two times we have been here have been excellent. The service was wonderful and so was the food. I think they might of changed their salsa because I don't see the chunky onions anymore but it's still good. Sign up for their emails because you get coupons!"}
{"text":"This on the border is the worst yet..we get here, it took them 10 mins to acknowledge our existence to even ask for beverages.  On top of that they claim to have ran out of chips...a mexican food place with no chips and salsa,  really!? Then we waited an additional 10 mins to get waited on. No beverage refills. This place has terrible customer service and quality is lacking.  Trust me, there are far better mexican food restaurants in the area,  go there and enjoy some chips and salsa for me!"}
{"text":"It's not Mexican, its Tex-Mex so as long as you realize that you're going to be ok. The salsa is awesome, the service is awesome and most of the food is awesome. We drive from the other side of town to go to this place. I have not had anything here I didn't like and most of the servers have all been great. Drinks are great too if you're looking for drinks.  They just redid the patio and it is super nice!"}
{"text":"In order for me to leave a comment I had to give 1 star. We were just waited on by Reggie in the bar area and his customer service SUCKS. It will definately  reflect in his tip. Did ask if we needed anything else and just dropped the bill as he flashed by, HOW RUDE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is by far the best I have ever had. Both our waiter Levi and the manager TJ are making sure we are taking care of!"}
{"text":"One of the few places in Vegas I can go to and enjoy Tex-Mex. Having grown up in Fort Worth, I prefer Tex-Mex to Cali-Mex, and OTB has a great menu that reminds me of home. I especially enjoy their empanadas, their salsa, and the flautas, but just about everything on the menu is great."}
{"text":"Love the margaritas here. My favorites are the Ranchiladas and the Queso dip. The fresh chips are delicious. The salsa has a nice kick."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood at lunch time and thought to celebrate National Margarita Day and wanted to sit outside. We were greeted and seated right away at a table outside. I did noticed the tables could of been wiped down/disinfected better.  Our waiter was good he took our drink orders, supplied Chips and Salsa (BTW their Salsa is excellent, has a nice spicyness). We celebrated with Borderita Grande (Lunazul Reposado tequila, Gran Gala orange liqueur ) and the El Jefe (Patrón Silver tequila, Patrón Citrónge premium orange liqueur) Both did the trick and were pretty good. We then ordered the appetizer Chicken Quesdillas and the lunch Classic Burrito (cheese, pico de gallo) with a side of Sour Cream. All the food was good, pretty basic.  The only thing that annoyed us was when we got the bill, there was an extra charge $1 for 2 tablespoons of Sour Cream. When we questioned the the charge we were told it wasn't the \"Sour Cream Sauce\". I notice a lot of restaurants are jumping in this and this is just another one.  All in all a decent celebration."}
{"text":"They have pretty good drinks like the margarita and sangria. I would say that this is typical Arizona Mexican that splits the difference between Tex Mex and  southwest Mexican food with lots of cheese and sour cream. The atmosphere is ok, it's like the Latino version of Chilis."}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes for food and the waitstaff was extremely rude. It seemed like they didn't want us there. We almost got up in the middle of eating chips and salsa and left. If I could give this place a 0, I would."}
{"text":"No wait & the food was awesome. I had the Brisket Tacos and they were fabulous! Tina was attentive and soft on the eyes. They struck it out of the park tonight."}
{"text":"I've been here on three separate occasions.  The first time I visited, the place was absolutely marginal.  As I was eating I'm thinking to myself, \"Yes, I'm eating a burrito...but I don't know why it doesn't taste as good as, say, Taco Bell.\"  The second and third visits to this place were work related, and I wasn't the one driving or deciding on lunch, so I didn't have much choice.  And I kept thinking the same thing that I thought on the first visit: Why isn't this as good as Taco Bell?    If I give a place one star, that means I'll pretty much have to be dragged unconscious to the establishment in order for me to step back inside.  Yes, I do think Taco Bell is better than this place (especially when it comes to price), but I'm not going to throw a fit if somebody else is footing the bill."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to OTB for lunch today and ordered the Mango Chicken Salad - one of our favorite salads to eat of any place in Charlotte. What was served to us was not at all what we expected. We received a small oval size plate of iceberg lettuce, romaine spines, less than 4oz of chicken and no roasted corn. When mentioned to be server that this was not our first time eating this salad there and that the salad was not prepared the same way it had been in the past. He did not check with his Manager about our concern, but rather stood there and told us the plates have changed. We ate the salad as we were hungry and paid our bill. Before leaving we spoke with the Manager and explained to her what was wrong with our meal. She offered to discount the meals but we insisted on paying because we    didn't want her to feel we were seeking a handout or some compensation. The price of the meal includes good food and good service, and they get one shot to do both right. Let's hope they will next time."}
{"text":"I'd have to say that my experience was average. The good things- the guacamole  was very good, the margarita that I requested with Hornitos was very good (and strong). The pre made Patron margarita was also good, and I'd definitely get the chicken flautas again. The bad- the avocado fries- they sounded good in theory, but had a cardboard type taste. Also the strawberry margarita that was on happy hour for $3, was very weak, like a strawberry slush."}
{"text":"We were here for two hours. The server was friendly but the food was not worth the wait. We filled up on chips and salsa because we had to wait for soooo long. So unfortunate !"}
{"text":"Fantasic chips, guacamole & salsa! Excellent service from our Jon kept our drink FULL, I enjoyed this place a lot Idk why it's only rated 3 stars. I recommend this place to EVERYONE who loves Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"First of the service was great, no complaints there! The food however is at best glorified fast food. The chips were so salty that they were unedible and the salsa was way to sweet and did not taste fresh. The tortillas were very bland and their texture was  that of a store bought tortilla. Not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"food was lacking, not only was there not much of it but it lacked flavor. the server. was rude and charged us 99 cents for half and shot glass of cheese and the meals were ridiculously over priced. we came to this restaurant because the chain Mexican restaurant in our area closed and it was in the area. the bathrooms were not well kept and the sinks were broken. chain Mexican restaurants are usually a gamble but save yourself the trip and make tacos at home for a fraction of the time and cost."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, so craving Tex-Mex in North Carolina... this was the closest thing I could find.  Good food, pretty quick service, and a pleasant atmosphere.  Prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to in Texas for Tex-Mex, so that's why it gets 3 instead of 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food is alright. It's not bad but it's not amazing either. Large portions at reasonable prices. I do have to say the guacamole was very good. The biggest thing I liked about this place was the service. I was pleasantly surprised because they were really busy. We got everything on time and our drinks stayed filled."}
{"text":"The food is usually good but every time we order take out or door dash or to go, it takes fooooooorrrrreeeeevvvvvvveeeeerrrrr!!!! Dining in is usually always great and we hardly have any problems. But man, dine out is the slowest experience I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I just suffered through the worst mexican meal Ive had in phoenix in 20 years.    Chimi was mostly flour t o rtilla and really dry meat inside.  It was luke warm when served w a little sauce.  The onions inside the chimi were the inedible skin.  The whole thing was bland and tortillas had no crunch,  like they had not even been fried.   Endless bowl of rice and beans.  Same. No taste.    At one point the manager came walkin through the bar where I wad sitting, yelling to the bartender about a to go order.  When he walked by me he was yelling right in my ear.  Very rude and annoying.    The waitress was good and courteous.  Only reason I dont give a 1 star.    It will be another 10 years before I come back.  Good Luck OTB. Your restaurant is way below average."}
{"text":"I was ready to settle for Taco Bell, made wrong turn and found myself entering the On The Border parking lot. Their steak street tacos were amazing! Kaylan is my new favorite server with her helping pick the right tacos on through her superb service. She is even tempting with some desert!"}
{"text":"First visit was here. Server recommended me bowl of shrimp. That was awesome. Server was friendly. Food is good,quantities is ok. Ice cream  was yummy . Restaurant was very pleasant n well decorated. I will come again n again. I am love in it ."}
{"text":"Our server Summer was the best part of the night. Food was just ok not the same flavor as others I've been to. Very bland. Salsa was sad. I was excited to finally take my husband to an on the border but sadly after this experience he won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been twice and by myself at that. I sit at the bar and the bartenders are very nice and wait on me hand and foot. Food is wonderful! I will stop in from time to time. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here after our disastrous intro to O'SUCKA Japanese. SO GLAD WE DID! Great food, great service and reasonable prices considering the generous portions. WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"After a 6 1/2 hour shopping spree with my sister, we were tired and hungry. We decided to try this place since niether of us had ever been there. The place was clean and comfortable, very cute. The staff was very pleasant and our server was the nicest!! The chips and salsa were very good! Our entree's had a great presentation and was very filling! I had the Dos XX Fish Tacos, with rice and black beans, they were pretty good but not amazing!! My sister has some chicken enchiladas which were yummy. This place is cool, I will have to go back and check out their Happy Hour!! Although, if you are looking for authentic Mexican, this would not be the place."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Ordered online and was told it would be ready in an hour. Went to pick it up and it wasn't ready. After standing there for 30min I asked for an update. I was told it would be another 20min, asked to speak to a manager. 30min goes by and food is finally ready. Manager never showed up, but after 2 hours I was ready to leave."}
{"text":"I cannot give lower than 1 star. We walked into the establishment and stood at the door for 5 minutes before realizing that no one would seat us. Then we went to the bar and seated ourselves. We waited another 5 minutes and made eye contact with two individuals who were more interested in a personal conversation with another co worker. We walked out, still hungry. We probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Very good service, and atmosphere but my husband and I BOTH didn't enjoy our food. Salsa that comes with complimentary chips was too spicy for my taste, although good flavor. My meal was not good, I barely ate any of it, and ultimately needed to get diner elsewhere. Husband ate his but said it definitely was not the best. Overall, I probably wouldn't go back here, but if worse comes to worse we will know it's there."}
{"text":"Good service, amazing food. After so so reviews I was pleasantly surprised :) Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"Mexican restaurant chains...what can I say.  Some are better than others and if you compare OTB to \"family\" owned Mexican restaurants then you aren't being fair.   OTB is really good for what it is.  Their salsa and chips are unique and tasty. Their Guacamole Live is my favorite.  The serve Dos Equis on tap and Negro Modelo in a bottle which they used to have on tap but no more (shame). Taco Tuesday is the day we go.  Cheap and good.  An after work dinner that won't break the bank.  We almost always sit in the cantina and Kelly is the best.  Great friendly service with a smile.  Thanks Kelly!   It can get busy and longer than usual wait times are expected but that gives me more time to drink beer and scarf down chips. Overall OTB is our go to restaurant especially for the specials.  By some of the other reviews it seems you can't please everyone but they must be doing something right because they seem to always be busy."}
{"text":"Obviously this place is hurting for better management. Did call ahead seating and hostess lost our names. What is one one of their staples? Queso. On a Friday night we order two bowls of queso. Waitress returns and said they ran out and that our two bowls went to a table seated after us. With all these problems the managers tries to avoid us like the plague. Perhaps they cannot find the right personnel. If that's true, do our community a favor and close your doors."}
{"text":"Went here on  Sat night with my husband and daughter.  Great food and great service what more could you ask for. I would definatley go back."}
{"text":"Went here last night and it was a typical chain restaurant.  The queso was mostly Velveta with a couple veggies thrown in.. The chips are magically thin and baked though."}
{"text":"Always in search of a great Mexican Restaurant in Vegas and this ain't it! I wish someone would open a Tex Mex restaurant in town. Wishful thinking I suppose. Beyond disappointed, livid describes it better. 4 people cost $90!   Walked in around 2 or 3 p.m., the place was dead-REALLY dead-no employees to be found anywhere! I literally had to go to the kitchen and ask if anyone was working in order to be seated!   Finally seated, I inquired about a Margarita for Happy Hour and was told since I was in a booth, I would have to pay full price unless I wanted my entire party (me, hubs, 4 year old and 17 year old) to move to the bar! Total BS! We were literally the only people in the joint. You would think the goal would be repeat business or at least taking pride in their job. No such luck. Worst Margarita I've ever had and it made me sick for 2 days due to the rot gut Tequila, despite my request for top shelf alcohol.   Appetizer was sparse and cost $17! Entrees were terrible and tasted like leftovers. Service was equally poor. No tea refills, no chip refills, no free queso like the sign on the table described. Waitress acted like she was in the weeds and we were her only table and in fact the only people in the entire place! I don't know how they stay open.   Driving to Centennial to me is always a waste of time and this experience to me is pretty typical of the area and why I avoid it.   We won't be back. It was so bad that I really should call corporate."}
{"text":"Foods always pretty good. The key is to get good service! Skyelar was a stellar waitress! Very polite ad attentive!! She kept our drinks full and chips full!"}
{"text":"Been going to otb for years now. I used to go to one in virginia all the time as a kid. This place has always been a solid place for tex mex place for me. The food and service is always excellent and quick. I recommend the empanadas"}
{"text":"The previous reviews that mention the service problems are absolutely correct, it is horrible.  We have visited this restaurant several times over the last few years and it has really gone downhill.  You very rarely see a waiter even when the dining room is practically empty.  Yesterday we went for a late lunch and were seated right away in a booth.  There were three tables in the entire place that were occupied by a total of 7 people.  We sat, looked at the menus, and waited...and waited....and waited...and got up and left.  10 mins is my max time in an empty restaurant without seeing a server.  That will be out last visit, too bad, I thought the food was ok for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The one in Rapid City, SD, where I'm from sucked so I have not been to one in years. Figured its close to the movie theater we were heading to and I was craving some chips and salsa. The On The Border chips that you buy at the grocery store are my favorite.   We stood in the doorway while the bewildered hostess who watched us walk in contemplated lord knows what then finally acknowledged us after the ten people in front of is all going to the same table via the manager were being sat. We waited for about five minutes before a manager just coming on duty asked us if anyone had taken our drink order. We said no. In fact we had yet to even be greeted. All the while our movie deadline looming.   First words out of the servers mouth was apologizing and saying there was a mix up. I I have to give her props as after she took charge found she was very attentive. I drank my soda in about two minutes and upon her first pass by the table after taking our order she had a refill ready. Good job. I told her we were pressed for time and our food came out fast. Our drinks were never empty not was really good service. Food was really good too. I had the three sauce chicken burrito and Jen had the grilled chicken. She was very happy with it. Other than the horrible initial impression which had me convinced this would be a horrible experience, the only down side was that the chips at the restaurant pale in comparison I the ones at the store. Salsa was good though with the perfect amount of heat. Just enough to make your tongue sweat.   I seriously was not thinking this would be a good experience but the server really turned things around to shall I say, I was actually impressed. Good job Erica. We will be back."}
{"text":"Bad, just plain bad. Refried beans were not cooked, chewy. Chimichanga had more veggies than chicken. Rice boxed. Wife's enchilada tortilla wasn't even cooked/ heated. Service was avg, unfriendly in the bar."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Always good food! The stacked nachos and the sampler are a goto when drinking. :)"}
{"text":"Went here with my people and it was just okay. I've never really been an On The Border fan and I seem to forget that until I go again and decide I don't really like the food (again). This time I tried some enchiladas (my favorite) but they put this weird white sauce on it and it was not yummy. Chips and salsa were good but that's about it."}
{"text":"Last time I dined here the food, drinks and service were not good. I left a poor review on Yelp and I have to say management was very responsive! They left a message asking me to contact them through their website, which I did.  I ended up speaking with both the GM and DM and they assured me that my visit was a fluke and asked me to come in again and give them another try.   Yesterday, my wife dined there for lunch and the food, service and drinks were excellent! My wife had the chicken chimichanga with a green sauce and I had a Dos Equis Fish Taco. We shared an order of queso and both had strawberry frozen margaritas.   Our server was very polite and attentive and we never waited long for anything we asked for. The food came out quickly from the kitchen and it  was piping hot! The DM even came by our table when I told our server we had a bad experience last time we were there. The DM, Aaron, was very professional and funny.  It turns out my last visit was a fluke because this was the quality of food and service that I was used to."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner here. I had a carnitas chimichanga and husband had carne asada.  I have been trying carne asana  for the last year each time we had Mexican food. I am tired of carne asadas so I only had a couple of bites of his but it was maybe the best I have tasted. My chimichunga was great.   We were seated immediately and drink orders taken promptly.  Chips and salsa was good, dinner was excellent and service was just fine. Ambiance and noise level were very comfortable.  We will come back again."}
{"text":"OMG my mouth was in constant foodgasmic status. By far the best burritos I ever had. Our waitress Amanda Perez is the best and sweetest waitress ever. I will definitely make it a point to come back to see Amanda and eat the delicious food."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the service is terrible. The waitress pretty much ignored us until halfway through the meal (the food was delivered by kitchen staff) and when we were finished, it took her 15 minutes to bring us the check! When you have a restless toddler, that 15 minutes can be agonizing. If they kicked up their customer service a bit, it would be a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a great location. Right next to the Concord Mills. We were seated quickly. Our waitress was super friendly and our food came out pretty quick. The restaurant was clean. We had a nice family lunch."}
{"text":"It's so sad because the atmosphere here could be amazing. It's so fun and full of promises. Sad to say the promises aren't fulfilled. They didn't bring water for over 15 minutes. They didn't bring half the food we ordered. It was so awful. The lady was super nice but the food was awful and the attention to detail was worse. All in all a horrible experience. We won't be back! Ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't crazy about the food or service. Not a great experience, guess I'll try again. The design on the inside was nice though."}
{"text":"I know, I know, it is a chain.....but for my tastes it is one of the best (remaining) Mexican chains.  There are so many \"traditional\" style Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area - I find them bland and same tasting.  A good measure for me is the Salsa....in this case On the Borders uses a pureed FRESH salsa mix, with a strong fresh tomato taste.  The local Mexican places always use a cooked/canned/jarred old tasting salsa.  The Chips at The Border are also very light and not the heavy thick corn chips.   Now on to the food....the Chicken is a highlight and is seasoned very well - it is great in almost every dish. My favorite is the Chicken Burrito or Chimichanga with the sour cream sauce."}
{"text":"I'm leaving a positive review because we have been traveling and have eaten at a lot of the places around the area. Lots of wasted money. Here our food was good and it was nice to have a friendly server Sharay was as sweet as could be and that's hard to come by now days."}
{"text":"I wish i could give it a zero star. We started eating chips and salsa and there was hair in the salsa. We told our waiter and the manager and both were so casual about it when apologizing. Worst service ever. The waiter saw the hair. The manager didn't care enough to even inquire. Needless to say we legt immediately and won't be returning."}
{"text":"$10 all-you-can-eat tacos.  That would be great if they brought you 4 or 5 tacos.  It's 2 at a time, with a 29 minute wait between them.  Ugh.  Yes, the tacos are good, but it's not worth the hassle.  Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Usually find something weird in my salsa.....hard plastic once a thin plastic from maybe opening a container of some sort.. and some funky food piece that wasn't supposed to be there, not sure what it was. There service is decent and there fajitas with fresh  tortillas is very good I have to say ... I would make own salsa or just eat a little pico for spice. I've have lived around the block for around 10 years and now will  try it agin from time to time to give it another shot but I don't eat the salsa.  Haha  . just my own experiences."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews of this place.  This was my first visit to this chain and I was pleasantly surprised.  I got the combo so I could try a little bit of everything the chain has to offer.  The complementary chips are large, lacking flavor, and room temperature.  The mild salsa is a bit sweet and tasted good, while the hot salsa was a bit spicier but had a really weird taste.  The chicken tortilla soup, advertised as having avocado, had one tiny slice included.  Disappointed.  There was plenty of chicken and rice, and the broth was rather on the mild side.  The chicken taco was stuffed well.  The taco shell reminded me of pita bread.  The enchiladas were ok, and the sour cream sauce was the best part of those.  The rice was bland, and the refried beans were delicious and thick.  The server was great.  Water was refilled as needed and needs anticipated.  I had a coupon/discount for checking in via Yelp.  I didn't meet the minimum purchase by a few dollars.  The manager gave me a discount of more than the original discount.  It was very nice and not at all expected."}
{"text":"I love the chicken fajitas. We come here all the time for the fresh chips and yummy salsas. If you are looking for amazing Mexican food at an affordable prices, this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"Experience was horrilble. Server was rude and gave bad service. We stood at the enterance for over 5 minutes before being seated and then had to listen to the hostess curse half the meal. No management in sight. Went online to answer the survey and heard NOTHING back. Obviously corporate didn't care."}
{"text":"I haven't been to On the Boarder since probably 2002 at the location in Aliso Viejo, while I was out in Vegas we decided to give it a try. We chose their 3 for $11.99. Between the two of us, we purchased; House Salad, Chile Rellano, Chicken Tostada, Pork Tamale, Chicken Taco and cheese enchilada.  GROSS GROSS and MORE GROSS. The chicken was dry, the red sauce was more like brown gross sauce. The best thing was the salad, & the rellano hands down. Rice was hard also.    Never going back."}
{"text":"I'm reminded of some 90s song lyric \"if you don't expect too much from me, you might not be let down\". And that's how I feel about On the Border. A  middle of the road chain restaurant with decent service and edible food. Authentic Mexican street food? Not a chance. Decent? Why not. This is a good spot for folks like my parents who (god bless em) like Mexican-ish food for gringos. Think Taco Bell's more mature big brother, Taco Bell after Taco Bell's first divorce.  You have 100 better options in Charlotte for Latin food, but OTB isn't hurting anything."}
{"text":"Drinks where good. Food came out cold. We left and went somewhere else this was a bust.."}
{"text":"The food was gringo interpretation of Mexican food. Which meant the sauce was not spicy but bland with a side of mild. I swear the rice was from Uncle Ben's it was so bad. My chicken tortilla soup was tasty. Typical suburban crowd of tired moms, bitter dads and unruly children screaming everywhere. Our waiter was efficient but odd. The chips and salsa were good but its hard to mess that up.  If we were not meeting friends here I would have chosen a better chain restaurant or better yet a local one. Hell the food from the local food carts downtown is better. Boring is the word that sums it up. Boring."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at an On the Border that I didn't like.  This location was no different.  I had queso and fish tacos and both met my expectations.  It is pretty good, standard tex-mex!  They do lose a couple points because the floor was a mess!  Why are employees wiping off tables with debris and crumbs falling to the floor (and seats) and not sweeping up the mess afterwards?  I'll never understand this method of \"cleaning\"."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We waited for over 35 minutes for our meal. And when they finally brought our order, the ultimate fajita meal was missing. They gave us an excuse about them cooking the shrimp. We waited another 10 minutes, still no fajita meal. A manager came over to apologize and remove the meal we did not get from our bill. He also removed a  plate of nachos from the bill. First and last time we will ever step foot in an On the Border."}
{"text":"I liked it! Cute little place. The watermelon margarita was really good! I ordered the quesodilla, bf ordered enchiladas and we were both happy"}
{"text":"Although, we wait usually to be seated (when its slow and staff is everywhere) I still like OTBs solely for there bomb.com happy hour! There avocado fries are so good & a lot of there drinks. They are located in a very busy area right off the fwy and close to so many other shops. I like this place, its like a new mexi type of place."}
{"text":"Me and my roommate had great and responsive service. Food came out great. Would recommend getting a bowl or dip for the chips however as the salsa is only mediocre."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our ten year old son to this  particular On the Border restaurant this last Saturday after his flag football game.   We'd never been to any On the Border before, and we love Mexican food, so we were excited to try it.   It was a disaster. There was no hostess upon entering, and there were several groups of people standing there seemingly frustrated. Finally after ten minutes a waitress appears and starts to seat us and apologizes for the wait.   The food was terrible. My husband order mini chicken tacos and it looked inedible. It was extremely greasy and the chicken looked burnt. He sent it back, but the new plate didn't look much better than the original.   My son order the mini beef tacos. His looked a bit better, but they gave him enough lettuce and cheese for maybe half of one of his tacos.   I ordered the cheese enchiladas. They looked like they'd been made two days ago and then microwaved. The rice had something in it that left a terrible after taste.   The odd thing was that this place was packed with people, and I can't figure out why anyone would go here."}
{"text":"the food is good. the waitstaff tries, but always seems to act like they are beyond slammed. other places serve as many people and they can handle it so i wonder if they are trained here to do more than smile and be nice. why the 1 star? because i noticed a long hair in the chip basket. pushed that aside. we were done with it anyway. getting my entree anyway. after 1 bite, noticed a hair in that. i kid you not. told the young waitress about both hairs at that point. she gets a new entree and leaves the chip bowl with the hair in it on the table. you are in the wrong job to not be able to think you should have took that away too so we don't have a constant gross reminder on the table. we never received an apology. won't be back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. The chips and salsa are great as well as their fajitas, Chimichangas, burritos, etc."}
{"text":"Don't do it! Way to expensive for the kind of food served. Fish taco's served with FRIED FISH! Yikes! My son had the \"live\" queso and chips. He thought  this would be fun to see them made at the table. All the server did was dump the cheese, etc. in the  bowl and stir! Not much of a show for 8.00! Bad nachos. However the chips and salsa at the table were good."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are awesome. The Queso was good with chips. We ordered the sample plater with Queso cheese. Naturally its crowded on this day and mistakes with orders are expected. But doesnt take away from the flavors. Wore more salsa on my shirt than usual but hey I enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"Before we moved to Las Vegas On the Border was a favorite of my wife's in South Carolina. We have not visited this location that often (maybe three times) since moving to Las Vegas. One reason being that it is very far from our house, and the other that the service is horrendous. The service, sadly, appears to get worse from visit to visit. They also tend to run out of food, this most recent time they had run out of french fries). They also do not carry similar items as other within the brand (no white queso at this location), but sometimes do (1 out of three times they had it. The two times they didn't our server acted like I was stupid for even asking if they offered such an item.The end of this last visit was probably the worst because our waiter practically forgot about us and we had to almost jump up and down and wave our hands to get his attention. When speaking to the gentleman in the table next to us, we found that he had planned to order desert, but because the same server had seemingly forgotten about him as well, he was not going to. It is sad to see a restaurant that used to be a favorite has such poor service. We will probably not be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this On The Border several times and the main thing that keeps me coming back is the guacamole live. I'm a huge guac lover and the guacamole live at On The Border is on point. The avocados are always fresh and delicious. I would go there just to order this.  My husband and I were seated quickly on a busy Sunday and the service was great.  For my meal, I ordered the Cabo Grilled Shrimp Tacos.  It comes with three mini (and they are tiny) corn tortillas with grilled shrimp, lime cabbage-carrot slaw, pico de gallo, and avocado.   The tacos were just OK.  I thought it was extremely spicy.  Normally spice doesn't bother me but today these tacos were so hot, my lips were burning.  It was hard for me to enjoy them.  I've never had these tacos before so I'm not sure if they are meant to be that spicy or mine were just made that way today.  I'll be back to get the guac but I'll stay away from the cabo shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Great place to go to when you are in north las vegas. Does get busy for lunch and dinner, good to go on off hours. Salsa and chips are great. Plates are generous and delicous"}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least 5 times. I always get the fish taco. This time it was too salty and tasted old. I prefer my fish taco grilled. They had it battered. Two thumbs down. But the atmosphere was good. I watched my panthers play and had good laughs."}
{"text":"I think the only thing I can say I am guilty to like is their empanadas and cheese sauce but how to you eff up fried dough stuffed with meat and some melted cheese?  I came because I'm hella bored with the foods around the house that I frequent and we haven't stepped into a On the Border for a while.   Big mistake.   Look now I can't quite possibly prove that my cousin did not give me a stomach flu the night before with his BBQ, but no one else is sick.  Yes, I wasn't feeling great before eating, but it was mostly related to being hungry. I was in pain a few hours after and was throwing up and riding the porcelain bus so frequently that I wish I had a padded toilet seat. It's day two and I haven't eaten and I'm just sipping on pediatric electrolyte....Slowly, because drinking too much causes severe pains.   This place is no bueno!"}
{"text":"The tacos, chips and salsa are really good. This is one of the few places with coronaritas, which is one of the only reasons I go here. But be sure to ask about all drink prices and \"additions\", they'll surprise you with odd charges for different flavors."}
{"text":"Food was up to par with what I would expect from a chain Mexican restaurant... But the server JESSE JAMES is what keeps me coming back. He is an asset to this restaurant! Give this guy a promotion and allow him to train all your servers in the meaning of customer service."}
{"text":"Having moved to Peoria recently, we have been trying to find good restaurants - especially Mexican food.  This is not the place.  We went there on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite slow so the service was excellent.  The drinks were good, chips good and atmosphere very nice.  The food was absolutely horrible and I would go out on a limb to say the worst I have ever had.  I don't know what spice they use on their beef but it is just terrible.  It was not just me, the others in the group agreed.  I wish I would have seen the yelp reviews prior to going in.  The one review that stated the food was abominable was right on."}
{"text":"Awesome little joint to hang out at. My food was amazing and my \"blue lagoon\" margarita was delicious.   The staff are all friendly and my waiter was very sweet and very attentive tonight.   Highly recommend, if you wanna grab a bite and a drink with some friends. :)"}
{"text":"My wife loves their chicken flautas so I was forced to give them another try snd I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Service was efficient food came out hot and very quickly. I even got to meet Christian the general manager who was extremely pleasant and seemed to be genuinely interested in how our experience was coming along.  Very happy with this visit, hopefully things are turning around here."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes, no service what so ever , even after asking the hostess numerous times .  We will take our business elsewhere"}
{"text":"On the border is one of my favorite places to go, the Woburn MA location was my go to place before moving to AZ. The bartender at this location (tonight) was an ass. I had a tough week so I decided to go get a massage then doing some make up shopping so I wore comfy clothes and no makeup. The massage place couldn't get me in for an he so went to get a drink at otb. Sat at the completely empty bar and he came right up to me super friendly when he asked for my id ( I am 25) I realized I left it in my husbands wallet , he couldn't serve me I get it no big deal . I order an appetizer. Then he never comes back ! No small talk nothing , just stands by the service bar . Another women about my age comes in with maybe her mom they order drinks and crazy she wasn't asked for id? She was dressed up make up The whole deal. He stayed and chatted with them for a bit then stood by the service bar after 40 minutes he finally came over got my check and left .  If you have a policy enforce it equally and if your a bartender have a personality"}
{"text":"We tried to go here today after my daughter's dance recital. She picked the place. It was 2:45pm. I asked if we could have a booth, and the hostess said, \"well, here's the problem. A lot of our servers just want to get out of here, so the only room I can seat you is in here\", pointing  to one little overly crowed area. My husband and I looked at each other in shock, and said, \"well, we can help them get out of here. We'll just go eat somewhere else!\" I will NEVER go back! How freakin tacky!!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Mexican chain.  The chips and salsa are very good, and so was the margarita's.  the enchalata's I ordered were average."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I loved it. The music, the environment, the food, and the service was excellent. Our server, Matthew was very sweet and attentive. I am planning my next visit here with my family."}
{"text":"Great for lunch on a warm spring day on the patio. Went with my bf and got some mango margaritas on special for cinco! Waitress was really nice and brought us extra chips and salsa already packed up with our Togo boxes. I thought that was an awesome extra touch without us even asking... Now we have dinner :)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this place. I went during lunch, had the chicken fajitas, and loved them. I definitely recommend this place at lunchtime, as it isn't too crowded and the prices are better. Also, our waitress was amazing! She waited on several tables and even heated up the tortillas. She also gave my family water to-go when she heard we were on a roadtrip. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome first experience! Brooke was super super helpful and sweet and made it fun for us! Everyone was extremely nice and I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice (so far) and it was great. I'm not sure what I ordered but it was made up of rice, cheese sauce, a portabella mushroom sliced up, and chicken. It was really delicious, ask for the cheese sauce on the side though because even for somebody like myself (who loves cheese) it can be overwhelming. Their chips are usually served hot with just the right amount of salt. The servers are generally friendly. The food can take a little bit of time but I work in a kitchen so that could be due to a number of variables. Just go with a friend and enjoy some good conversation! Yum."}
{"text":"With all the choices for Mexican Food in Metro Phoenix, this  place is my last choice. the food is boring. I couldn't believe the taco salad served to my mother!  2 tablespoons of ground beef on a plate of lettuce, and about 5 thick soggy chips. It tasted terrible and my mom couldn't eat it. Del taco has better tacos than what i was served.  The group was very dissatisfied with the food, service, and quality of the food; i didn't say anything at the time, as i was a guest with a large group. I won't be returning to On the Border, even if i was invited out by friends!!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday and got their all you can eat taco special \"this weekend only\" limited to: chicken, shredded beef or ground beef.  I can best compare the quality of the tacos to that which you can find and make for yourself at a lower end casino buffet (think $10 station casinos or silver sevens). Tons of shredded lettuce, bagged cheese, very little meat, huge soft taco shell. Wasn't great.  We also got a half dozen wings to try since they were 35 cents at the time and they were the smallest wings I've ever eaten...typical buffalo with Frank's red hot /butter mix. I hope they don't serve these sized wings at regular times.  We also ordered a weak frozen margarita pitcher.  Service was actually pretty good and the fresh chips and salsa weren't bad. Was gonna shoot this one a 3-star but that \"A-Ok\" rating wouldn't be accurate."}
{"text":"We visited on the boarder last night and had the worst dining experience ever.  I asked for another variation of salsa, and was told to go somewhere else for that. The entrees were delivered on side plates with the food falling off, and when I asked for a larger plate I was told no, they didn't have anything larger. (How about offering an alternative like a second plate). Beans and rice are brought to the table family style, but again no room on the plates. I even asked if we were supposed to eat right out of the bowl, the served offered a sarcastic remark. On The Boarder, your food has always been one bad experience away from fast food. I will never return after the service I received last night."}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  The service, is another thing all together.  I've never had rude service here, just very slow and indifferent service.  Tonight, for example, my friend ordered a chimichanga with carne asada, but received something else.  We aren't actually sure what was in the chimi he received, but it wasn't carne asada.    Additionally, every single time we go there, no matter the time of day or how busy it is, we wait a long time to be seated, to get our drink orders taken, and getting drink refills is unlikely most of the time.  The manager passed our table at least twice and didn't notice our empty glasses and craning necks looking for our waitress.  We would be regulars if the service wasn't so awful.  The food is very good but not good enough to endure the terrible service more than a couple times a year.  Maybe that's how they stay in business?"}
{"text":"Ordered online, came within 35 minutes so that was nice. But what I paid $10 is absolutely pathetic. Tiny little bowl that is barely a snack. I'd consider this a piece of chicken on top of lettuce and tomato. Barely any beans or rice. Absolutely not worth it."}
{"text":"Probably the best chain I've eaten at.  I had the street-style carnitas tacos, because I'm always all over stuff with carnitas. The soft corn tortillas were on the tiny side (even for street tacos, which generally annoy people because they're so small.) but they heaped the pork on, which made he tacos not so skimpy even though the tortillas were small. The pico de gallo and avocado slices were a good touch too.  Probably the only thing they should do to the dish is add more cilantro, actual taqueria tacos usually have copious amounts of it, and the places I go are definitely heavy handed.  The service was good, although for some strange reason my dad's food was brought out beforehand, and no indication was given that the server couldn't carry it all, etc. Just \"oh here's your enchiladas\". He did show up two minutes later with the other three dishes, but those two minutes were kind of awkward. Might have been that the kid was new?  Over all, definitely a solid choice."}
{"text":"The food was good as usual and the drinks were great. Service could have been better."}
{"text":"We went there at 4pm and the place was dead- sat there 20 minutes and asked if we could get someone to please help us and when no one came we got up and walked out! What a joke! Horrible horrible service- the wait staff was standing around talking and laughing and not one person could take Our order! Unless you have an unlimited time to spare do NOT come here! As you can see from the reviews they have 3 stars which they are even lucky to have that!! The manager should be looking at the reviews and cleaning house asap to turn this place around!"}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting last night and I must say the food, drinks  and service was very impressive!   I'll definitely be back for more of those fried avocados. ..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early dinner at this restaurant on Thursday and we were beyond impressed! We had never been to an On The Border before and after our meal we felt it had spoiled every other Mexican restaurant we'd been to for us. The manager T.J. was so friendly and welcoming from greeting and seating us to keeping tabs on us throughout our meal to make sure we had everything we needed. It was obvious he loves what he does and takes great pride in the restaurant.  Chips and salsa can be hit or miss at so many Mexican places, either the salsa is good and the chips are lackluster or vice versa. Not the case here. So delicious! Then we ordered the tableside guacamole, chicken tortilla soup and chicken suiza enchildas. Everything was fresh, tangy and so flavorful! I can't remember the last time I had Mexican food that tasted so good.  So from now on, whenever we get a yen for Mexican, you'll find us at On The Border."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, from the food choices, to the ambiance to the service and staff. They've got it going on. I always order their empanadas, their enchiladas...are awesome. They have various to choose from their sauces are amazing. More like Tex-Mex, the food is delicous!"}
{"text":"The service here is good, but thats as good as it gets. The salsa is disgusting the food is bland and unidentifiable and its just generally annoying"}
{"text":"I ordered out here on election night and got the nachos. Walking in the takeout section of the restaurant, there were 3 workers, Not working who casually dispersed once they realized we were there to pick up orders. So I guess the back room is the getaway from work spot. The nachos were HUGE for $11. It looked to be something for a catered event, in a large metal pan and everything. I\"m not complaining. They served them with all ingredients put on the nachos, which I thought was odd for takeout. They should put each topping in a separate container to avoid things getting mess, with the exception of cheese which has to melt. I forgot to tell them to hold the refried beans, which I don't like. So I ended up having only a few bites. Not their fault. What I did taste wasn't impressive. I liked my chips and salsa better than my nachos. I'd give them a second chance, but be sure to request toppings be put in containers."}
{"text":"Much better service this time. Wait staff was pleasant and very quick. Drinks were refilled in timely manner and food arrived quickly; even though, they were busy."}
{"text":"Great service, ok margaritas, horrible food. Last time I ever order anything from the place. I feel very duped because I ordered 3 shrimp tacos, they were so tiny, 2 small shrimp on each one, 3 strings of cabbage and 1/4 teaspoon of avocado on each 3\" taco. These are not advertised as  street tacos probably because they are smaller than the average \"street taco\". At the table they served all the beans and rice you can eat probably because there was not enough of anything to warrant getting anywhere near full. Never again."}
{"text":"The food isnt terrible but the service is extremely slow.  The queso is good but this place lacks consistancy.  The food is not Mexican... its lazy americanized processed food.  Their rice is not spanish rice... its like an uncle bens microwave pouch. 2 stars because the queso is very good and i really enjoy the bagged chips they brought to grocery stores.  Not mexican.  More like chilis"}
{"text":"I didn't like On The Border the first few times I tried it a few years ago.  I tried it recently in Charlotte and it was delicious.  I think they changed something about their salsa, it's extra hot and so good now.  Their chicken enchiladas are great with the cilantro lime rice.  But the shrimp fajitas are where it's at!"}
{"text":"OK I'll go 2 stars. We went about 630PM on Sept 16, 2015. There were 7 of us. My chimichanga was not covered in sauce, because the guy asked me if I wanted red or green and I took the less picante (hot) and he said that'd be red, but the sauce was dark brown and in a tiny metal cup on the side. So far so good. But !!!!!!!!! the shredded beef was super, super salty, a pain to eat....the salt just RUINED THE TASTE. Order taken reasonably soon, but a lot of confusion as to who ordered what when they came with the plates. They ID'd each dish and asked whose it was. So my chimi was kinda' dry and again, horribly salty. I ate half and brought it home. Still salty. My wife was very happy with what she got, but for my dinner, 2 stars, no mas, es todo (no more, that's all). Lo siento mucho (I'm very sorry). :-( I don't think I'll go back. I like BACKYARD TACOS up on University Dr in Mesa a WHOLE LOT BETTER."}
{"text":"Ive been in 44 states and i eat out everyday......This is the #1 Worst Food out here in the Entire World!! Do Not Come Here I warn you $3.50 For a Bland Taco! Really!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for lunch today. Wasn't anything horrendous, nor was it anything spectacular. We sat at our table for seemingly longer than normal to be greeted; come to find out, per our server, management hadn't clearly defined sections and he wasn't aware he had our table. He was apologetic and professional about the situation, so it didn't really bother us too heavily.   Chips and salsa were great. I had beef enchiladas, they were decent. Refried beans were subpar. Her California burrito was about average as well.   As stated above; nothing spectacular, nothing horrendous. That being said, I don't feel it was worth the full price we paid."}
{"text":"I guess I'm in the minority, but I love On the Border. I think it's the best Mexican food in the area. I also think it receives a lot of unfair hatred simply because it's a chain.   The food is always on the money, and the service has never been bad during many visits. Perhaps we've been lucky. If I'm really fishing for a negative it's too many chips prior to the meal. But that's my own fault.   Overall, recommended. Then again, that's only for those who haven't been. If you have been,  then you know what to expect and a lot will depend on your personal tastes and service standards."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.  This was my first visit to this establishment.  And I can only describe it as utter chaos. When we sat down, there were several different salsas on the table.  Enough for each person to have their own dish!  AWESOME!  NOT!!  No one explained that some were hot salsa and some were mild.  That was fun to figure out with kids.  =/ Then there was service.  I have never seen a place run like this.  Admittedly, we had a new server in training who was also serving our table with a more established server, not that it helped. We had several things delivered or tried to be delivered to our table that we never ordered.  My dinner never came.  By the time it did come, everyone else had finished eating.  And then there was the manager who brought two different bills to our table, neither of which were ours....BEFORE our food even arrived. The food.... eh.  The guacamole is bland, as is what I ordered.  My daughter's meal seemed to be over seasoned.   It is said to be a Tex-Mex place.  An American version of Mexican food is the best I can try to explain it.   The atmosphere is good.  The wait staff is friendly, just inept.  Maybe there were under new management.  Maybe not.  No telling.  I won't be back.  That's for sure."}
{"text":"The food is good and so is the service. My only reason for the lack of stars is the awful smell outside. I believe  there's a major sewage issue and it reeks beyond belief. Management really needs to do something about this and also the air conditioning must have been off when we went because it was soooooooooo warm inside."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. I met some friends from work here for Cinco De Mayo and it was a good time. 5 dollar margaritas were really goo. I ordered the sampler and the waitress was right I couldn't eat it all. The food was really good I swear I had endless chips and salsa. I would go back."}
{"text":"Service was great, free chips were good, but my fajitas lacked flavor.  The decor is ok.  I liked that when I asked for extra napkins they gave me a generous amount (probably because they saw our 3 year old daughter).  We went around 3:30pm on a Sunday so it wasn't crowded.  Bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Incredible service. Pleasant atmosphere. Killer skinny margarita and steak/shrimp fajitas. Everything was cooked properly and they even subbed out my flour tortillas for corn tortillas. Delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain but I really like their beef empanadas and the brisket quesadillas. And can you ever go wrong with a cold beer or margarita?...I think not. Am I coming here every day, no, but it's convenient to my home and it's always an option that is \"in play\" in my household."}
{"text":"Amanda was amazing. She took care of us to the best of her capabilities. The kitchen was messing up our orders, but she kept us happy. I hope corporate sees this, because this lady was amazing."}
{"text":"My family eats here regualary. We have not been here for 3 or 4 months and EVERYTHING has changed. They give you family sized vowls and charge you $3.99 for shredded lettuce that normally should come with the meal. Our bill tripled! Good Job OTB...you lost regular customers."}
{"text":"the chile rellenos were actually ok but how the heck do you eff up rice and beans! it was bleh nothing special and definitely not worth $12 for my meal. the service was good the server was very sweet. the seating was ridiculous though it was a monday night not many people were there so i dont understand why we were squished in a middle table with both our kids. i will never be eating there again"}
{"text":"Our server Patrick was very attentive and fun.  We had a great time and he made sure we were taken care of.  The food and beer were great and sitting out on the patio in 95 degree weather was fun but a little toasty.  But we were the decision makers in that."}
{"text":"On a business trip to Gastonia, NC recently, I had the opportunity to eat at On the Border with some co-workers.  I ordered a margarita grande and grilled fish tacos.  The nachos were on the house.  The waitress recommended I get a two-for-one margarita instead of a margarita grande.  I should've gotten the margarita grande, which is what I order at most Mexican restaurants.  The drink I was served was small, but did include a refill, which wasn't much.  For the same price, a margarita grande would've been much more desirable.  Most of the Mexican restaurants I have eaten at have appeared to be owned and/or operated by Mexicans.  But this place appears to be a chain and is run by Americans.  Who knows who owns the place.  Anyway, the tacos were very tasty and the grilled fish was really delicious.  It's hard to find a great grilled fish taco, but this one definitely qualifies.  As far as the chips n salsa and the sides of rice and black beans, all were very salty.  There was definitely too much salt in the dishes, but again, they were tasty.  I'd eat here again in a minute."}
{"text":"I have to say I've always loved me some On The Border. I'm definitely not a picky person when it comes to Mexican. This Tex-Mex chain is one of the best though. I used to live near the one in Concord, NC and seemed to eat there at least twice a month. Now that I'm on the other side of town, this location isn't that close to me, so I don't make it out to On The Border as much as I would like. The free chips and salsa that they first bring out are the best. I always find this to be a test with any Mexican restaurant. If the Chips and Salsa suck.... then things usually go down from there...lol. I have always seemed to enjoy everything I have ever ordered on the menu, but on this visit I got the Southwest Chicken Tacos with a bed of rice (no beans). I had already told my friends at the table about it, and it just so happened that the Waitress recommended it also. And any good meal at a Mexican restaurant can't be complete unless you have a Margarita, and On The Border has one of my favorites. Its a Swirl Margarita with Sangria mixed in it!!! And you have to make sure you ask for the Sangria one, as there are different selections. I highly recommend this Margarita. If anything go to On The Border just for it...... you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"For years my family has been going to On The Border and I only have positive things to say about it. It is a very different experience than any other Mexican styled restaurant that  I've been to, and not for negative reasons. As soon as you walk in you can sense the true and original styles and environment of a real mexican restaurant. The decorations greatly represent the Mexican culture and traditions along with the music and the set up.           Service is very important in any type of business, especially in the food industry. However On the Border has that concept accomplished at a very high degree. Every worker, no matter what position, clearly cares about the experience of each and every customer. It is very important to me that the money I am spending is worth it, and I have never felt like my money was being wasted when I have gone there.       Most importantly, their food is amazing. Each time you go, you will receive chips and salsa apart from any other appetizer you decide to order and i'm being serious when I say that I don't know how chips and salsa could get any better. You can tell with each bite that the salsa and chips are freshly made with wholesome ingredients, resulting in the best taste. And that's just their chips and salsa. Each and every thing on their menu meets that standard. They have everything you could possibly want when it comes to mexican food and each dish is made at a very high quality. My favorite thing there, is the mango salad. Its a light crisp salad with grilled chicken and a healthy organic mango citrus dressing. Every dish that they have there is amazing and so delicious. If you want to experience real Mexican culture and food, I would absolutely recommend going to On The Border. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"i live for taco tuesdays and this is my new go to! the happy hour is all day long (monday-thursday) so you not only get $2 delicious tacos you can get a $2 draft or a $3 marg, and the white queso is to die for. 10/10 take all my money please"}
{"text":"This was a horrible t o Tuesday meal. ! Dissatisfied beyond belief.  Chili rellano was under cooked and deep fried. Awful inedible. Then a customer was told. O taco takeout on Tuesday. Too many people order more than they can eat and take leftovers home!!! Never heard of such poor business practice .wont go there again   Or recommend it  taco made me sick too."}
{"text":"Superb service!  Food is delivered fast, just the perfect temperature, tasty every time.  I get a 2 taco combo.  When I asked about healthier options, they offered to substitute sauteed or grilled veggies for rice & beans.  Killer queso, fajitas, and salads too.  Staff in the bar area are friendly and get to know you."}
{"text":"Walked in the door and my 9 year old pointed out that the place smelled like a bathroom. I shrugged it off and told her they must have been cooking a lot of eggs. I should have listened to my kid.  Ordered a specialty margarita that looked nothing like the picture and tasted like a watered down regular margarita. The waitress, who was doing double duty as the hostess, explained that all the bartenders \"do them differently\" and offered to take it back. I kept it, as I'm always afraid to send food back, who knows what I'll get in its place. Luke warm, bland food. So disappointed as I have been to a location in San Diego where the drinks and food were great. Oh well, we had to use our coupon..."}
{"text":"Month we went-May 2009.  Out to dinner with a friend and we had a delightful time. Our waitress, Sharona (I kid you not), was friendly and very helpful. She saw me perusing the margaritas and spoke about a couple of them. Our drinks arrived with the chips and salsa. I love that there were 2 little pots of salsa, one for each of us, as we love salsa. The margarita was a 9 out of 10 limes! We ordered a sampler of appetizers, and it was very good. I ordered a combo that included a chile relleno (I love chile rellenos). Our dinners arrived in a timely yet not too quick manner. This gave us time to work on our appetizers as well as have some great conversation. We didn't finish the appetizer as we were afraid we'd be too full to eat our dinners. My combo was hot and tasty. Sharona was a great waitress. She was knowledgeable without being pretentious. She gave us a take out container for our uneaten appetizers and we were on our way. All in all, this was such a relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"This is in our rotation of restaurants that our family of 5 visits regularly.  Is it authentic mexican food?  no.  But then again - hubby does not like true Mexican dishes...This is Tex Mex food.  The one thing we order off on the menu - and that really are top notch, are the fajitas.  Husband has ordered them everywhere - and really, here they are the best.  Mango Margaritas and chips and salsa are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Best chain Mexican food hands down. Great chips and salsa. I've been getting the 3 sauce fajita burrito for years and it's always sooooo good."}
{"text":"This is not the place you would want to go if you are a vegetarian.  There are literally no options. I ordered a veggie burrito and when it came to our table I think it looked like a burrito bu tclearly it wasnt a burrito which I have been having all these years. It was just a tortilla stuffed with veggies. There was no rice and beans were on the side.  I asked for a side jalepones and I got just one lucky jalepone sitting on top on what looked like a burrito.  I will never visit this place."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with a friend, since she had a gift card. The lunch specials were between $8-11. We both ordered the Dos X Fish Tacos.   The lunch was supposed to come with 2 tacos, rice & beans but instead we got 3 tacos which I assume is the dinner portion. After my inhalation of bottomless chips & salsa I could only eat one taco and half the rice & beans. The flavors were delicious and everything was hot.  I was happy with the food, environment, and staff. I'll be back if I have another gift card, otherwise I like to hit up La Unica for my mexican!"}
{"text":"Hi ho this restaurant is a no.  Service slow, food cold and not very tasty.  No need to go back!"}
{"text":"Have been too  this \"chain\" restarurant eons ago, and have stayed away from it since coming to vegas 8 yrs ago. Well last nite gave in a re-visited it. Well in 10 plus years they have made some major improvements in their menu. I was amazed . Have no doubt some of the standard items probably taste like they came out of a can. However the salads were great, gucuamole was fresh, helped w/ a twist of lemon. Chicken dishes are varied. Price is good, much better than a competitor down the street I won't mention (intials LM). Can't comment on the table service, since we ate at the bar. Bar service was very good. Desserts...hummm a yogurt place has just opened across the street...head for it...For dinner give this place a try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here.  The chips and salsa are the lightest, and thinnest I've seen anywhere.  You have to be careful you don't fill up on just the chips.  I had the 2 taco plate which is my favorite and comes with rice and beans.  I love the food the atmosphere and the service.  Definitely at the top of my list when I think of Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Good tex.mex food. Live close so easy for me. Good margaritas. Decent service. Prefer the local mexican places, but this place is good and closeby. Upset that I don't get my work discount anymore.:-(  But will return."}
{"text":"I am quite aware that this is a chain Meican eatery, but I cannot get enough of it.  I'm a traditionalist and always order the crispy beef taco's with refried and rice.  The quality is there, the consistancy is there and always, the service is there.  If your lucky, a guy named \"Philly\" will deliver your food.  He is straight outta Mexico and for sure one of the happiest guys ever!    Bonus: the fresh chips and salsa are free (regular salsa and hot, I like to mix) and the white queso dip is spot on."}
{"text":"Love their food but tried to order delivery according to yelp. They don't deliver unless it's a catering job. Went online after putting all the order online computer gives error message couldn't get the order online. So through not any fault of mine could not get any offers that were given for online orders. Doesn't seem                                                      Wanted to update my review. Since this review had an opportunity to talk to the manager. He was very apologetic about the matter and said to personally contact him if any more problems arose. I greatly appreciated his actions and comments."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this restaurant 4 stars is because they skipped our party of 8 on the waiting list. Other than that, they were terrific. Our waiter was quick getting drinks from the bar and refilling our waters. He had knowledge of the menu, and the food did not disappoint. I had the Dos XX Fish Tacos, and they were great. Overall, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Well, I would probably give 2 and  a half  stars because the floor manager was great at trying  to take care of me- my waitress was very busy and a table of one was not a big tip. Or could it have been???  I waited 8  minutes and he saw I had no water or chips yet and brought them to me.  I ordered a chicken taco (crispy) and a spinach and mushroom enchilada.  The  tortilla  soup never came. I was charged for the combo though. When I asked her she explained I needed to order a combo of three items to get the soup- but it doesn't say that.  The crispy taco was great. Delicious shell, moist chicken and good flavor. I really anticipated that spicy ( it was marked as such) enchilada.  It was... Sweet! They added their corn in the enchilada. The corn is sweet. Ugh... A sweet enchilada. I asked to replace it with a regular cheese enchilada- which I took s photo of, It was good.  Chain restaurant good.   I wish we had those hole in the wall authentic restaurants here in the Foothills.   The menu looked good- lots of choices. And they have a home made tortilla station. That's cool- but I didn't try them. Can't decide if I'll give this another shot or not. Depends on how desperate for Mexican food I get!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of OTBs!  The food and atmosphere is top notch as far as chain restaurants go.  Like many mexican restaurants, the chips and salsa are free.  Free is always nice but their salsa recipe is what sets it above the rest.  Every time I go here, I order an appetizer.  I have yet to order the actual entree courses.  Haha.  From 4-6pm the apps are half off.  Can you really blame me?? Get the Nachos.  They make them just the way I like it.  Each large individual nacho is made with precision and loaded with cheese and steak/chicken/bean.  Do it!  Enjoy!  Oh yeah, a live mariachi band started playing on our way out.. Cool!  Beers on tap:  Dos Equis (Amber and Lager), BL-lime, Blue Moon, Coors.   Ps.  I had to stop here so I wouldn't miss the opening pitch of the Phillies game.  Just so happen that Roy Halladay went on to pitch a NO HITTER in his postseason debut.  Great sign!! Thanks OTB!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Man, this place has become very disappointing. My wife and I have been coming here for years now, this will be our last time. The food the last few visits have steadily gotten worse and so has the service. Their refried beans and rice came out cold and the beans tasted like they came from a can. We had 4 different servers come to our table throughout the night which wouldn't be a problem but none of them refilled our chips or drinks. We finally asked for refills on both and another server came back with different drinks' which again, wouldn't be an issue, except we had to wait 10 minutes for another server to bring the correct drinks. Must have been busy,right? No, it was a Sunday and around 3:30. Not many people at all. The server that did come back more than once was extremely disconnected and oozed disdain towards us. We thanked him multiple times for bringing the food,napkins, and drinks and he acted as if we weren't speaking to him at all. I also let the original server know that it was my wife's birthday when we walked in because I thought that I recalled them singing Happy Birthday to someone else on one of our visits (might be mistaken) after the meal was over, still nothing so now let the current server know that it was my wife's Birthday and his response was \"Ok.............do you want some sopapillas, or what?!) I just responded with,no thanks, can we please just get 2 boxes. With no response, he went to get our boxes and returned 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"Man this place has really gone down hill over the years. The menu use to have a wide selection of pretty good food--not authentic--but good. Lately it seems like they are taking anything that had flavor off the menu. Literally only go for the salsa, quest and margarita now. Decent happy hour but always crowded and poorly handled by young put out staff."}
{"text":"I found it very dirty.  Staff was nice but when I went to the bathroom I saw a cockroach which really grossed me out."}
{"text":"We visited for Veterans Day, and thoroughly enjoyed our service by Zach. He anticipated everything we needed before we had to ask, was courteous, and all around a great server."}
{"text":"We've been here before and liked it. But this time, I was disappointed. All four of our meals were wrong in some way, but we only brought my meal to the waiter's attention. My burrito was steak, but should have been chicken. When I told the waiter, he didn't apologize or offer to bring me a new dish, and didn't even comp it off our check. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We heard that this food was good from our family members, so we decided to try it out. When we walked in no one greeted us or was at the hostess table. We waited for around 10 minutes before someone seated us, and we were the only people in line to be seated. Our waitress did not know the menu and had to look off of our menus to explain the details. We ordered 3 waters and they took awhile to get here, while our mouths were on fire from the spicy salsa. I ordered the Tex-Mex salad and asked for the dressing on the side when she brought them out the dressing was in the salad, but she said she would have them make another one if I wanted her to. The salad was okay, nothing special. Overall, the experience was mediocre."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the chicken tortilla soup.  Has a pretty tasty with slightly spicy chicken based broth.  The salsa is ok - a little too much tomato sauce flavor.  Chips were fresh & warm.  The people who served me were cheerful & polite. Most all employees there had an easy smile they were wearing."}
{"text":"I have to say I was skeptical to come here based on recent reviews. The only logical conclusion I can come to is maybe they were having a bad day?  So the service was wonderful, he even walked us to the door and opened it! My ice tea was never low.   I thought the food was excellent. It was a little on the expensive side. Two of us got iced tea, guacamole, two dinners and some sopa pics and it was 49 bucks but I think worth every bite!  They also had football on in the dining room, huge plus for me! Maybe their lunch service has bad service but the dinner shift doesn't."}
{"text":"For being a chain this is a decent spot that serves nice margaritas, tasty happy hr options. Last time I tried the live guac and it's super fresh. My friend tried the stuffed jalapeños with chile con queso and she did not like.  Shannon has been our server most of the time and does a good job.  I do hope they keep all the existing servers because  most of them are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"OTB's great food is the only thing that keeps me coming back! Service is always terribly slow and waitresses are rude! Drinks do not get refilled and it literally takes an hour or more for food to arrive. I love the tex-mex style entrees, but each time I come back, I kick myself for choosing the restaurant with the slowest service in town!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner last Friday night; I have to admit I wasn't excited about dining at a chain restaurant next to the I-10, but it was convenient. When we arrived, the parking lot was packed and I wanted to leave, but hubby said, \"Let's go inside and see,\" so we did. Turns out we LOVED the place! The hostess, Sylvia, was so genuinely warm; even though she was busy, she made us feel welcome. We waited only 10 minutes before we were seated inside and then our server, Taylor, came right away to take our drink orders. She was fun and friendly and like Sylvia, made us feel welcome. Next, a young man stopped by with a basket of thin, warm, and very tasty tortilla chips and two bowls of salsa - one for each of us. Wow...I've had to pay for chips that weren't half that good at other Mexican restaurants. And after we plowed through the first basket, he brought more...all delivered with a smile. My husband ordered the stacked nachos and I tried the steak quesadillas. The prices were reasonable, service was fast, food was yummy, and Taylor did a great job of keeping our sodas filled and making sure everything was good at our table. Then T.J., the manager, stopped by to see how we were doing. We were just blown away by the service here, especially since we'd dined at The Thirsty Lion in Tempe the week before and the service was horrible...literally nonexistent. That experience made us very appreciative of the friendly, welcoming atmosphere here. In fact, we had such a great time that we returned the next day for lunch with our son-in-law. I was thinking that maybe things wouldn't be as good the second time around, but I was wrong. This time we sat outdoors on the patio and our server was Shannon - again, so fun and genuinely friendly. Once again, the Chip Guy was great...he just kept the chips and salsa coming and those chips are the best - warm and so crisp. Again, the food was very good (this time, we ordered the Border Sampler, a burrito, enchiladas, and sopapillas for dessert) and we didn't have to wait forever for it to arrive. Plus, they delivered bottomless beans and rice!! Wow...amazing! T.J., the manager, was working again and stopped by to see how everything was...that guy really knows how to take care of his guests. I can't say enough good things about this place; as far as casual dining goes, this On the Border is hard to beat. Great Mexican food, wonderful service, and reasonably priced. We loved T.J., Taylor, Shannon, the Chip Guys, the food runners, and Sylvia the hostess...all wonderful people. Plus TV's in the bar and on the patio made my sports-crazy husband and son-in-law happy. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service is great, love, love the chili cheese con queso! Fajitas are great also!"}
{"text":"Service at the bar was over the top for lunch. Outstanding experience. A little pricey but the cheery service made it worthwhile."}
{"text":"There is nothing good about this place. Well, perhaps the chips. And Salsa. Those might be alright, but they certainly aren't enough to make me go back. Ever. I ordered a cheese enchilada. CHEESE darn it! TWENTY minutes later I cut into my food to find chicken. Vegetarian here. I asked for cheese, thank you.  I was so mad I asked for a box and left. I gave the food to my dad. I didn't want to wait another twenty minutes for the correct order to come out. No amount of chips and salsa could satisfy me. Service, obviously, is not great. They will give you the chips and salsa, which is pretty hot, and one drink. Then they will make you wait, and eat your hot salsa. Then, with a hot mouth, you will drink all of your drink. And they make you wait, and wait, and wait, for a refill. In the span of almost an hour, I got one refill. One."}
{"text":"We (stupidly) came back in hopes that MAYBE we could enjoy Taco Tuesday.  Never again. I ordered the Mahi Tacos off the gluten free menu. They came with a slaw like topping (cabbages and carrots) and tomatoes. I'm allergic to carrots and tomatoes.  The gluten free menu and no descriptions (my fault for not asking) so I just picked them off. My complaint about the tacos were that they were ice cold, dry, and honestly tasted how I imagine an armpit would taste. I had 1 bite and couldn't finish.  Our waitress comes back, clearly sees that I haven't eaten and doesn't ask if everything is OK.  Usually if a customer comes in and only has 1 bite of the meal and doesn't get a to-go box SOMETHING is wrong. She seemed like she didn't care about it at all. The margarita pitcher was weak again. We stopped at the grocery store after dinner so I  could actually eat. After this we are definitely NOT coming back here again."}
{"text":"What the heck is wrong with the other reviewers? Have they ever eaten Mexican before?????  I agree with Michael N. Our server looked like a model too. Ha.  The only thing good about the meal was queso and chips and our server. She was wonderful! The enchiladas and chicken was super bland and the rice tasted like a microwaved pack of uncle bens. The ground beef taco was fine if you're like me and love Taco Bell on poorer weeks.   Overall edible and fine but NOT WORTH $40..."}
{"text":"This is our go to margarita spot, we LOVE the drinks. However, the customer service that we get every time is terrible. Tonight we had the pleasure of having Zach as our server. He was fantastic, he took the time to talk to us and he took the time to care about the service we received. Being in the food service industry it's an extremely important part of your job. Most of the girls who work the closing in the bar area don't care about that or care about how they make their guests feel. Wether you are pregnant or not you shouldn't be rude and make rude comments about your guests. With 45 minutes left in your shift you shouldn't be complaining about your only guests in the house and saying that we always do this and complain about making us another drink. They constantly roll their eyes if we order another drink, they hang out on their phones or they complain about having to cover a shift and don't want to be at work. We always give this location a second chance and always regret going because of the terrible service the girls in the bar give us and like i said Zach was Fantastic he will be a good reason to go back, if we return."}
{"text":"This place used to be decent. It has fallen on hard times. Terrible service. Poorly trained employees that hate their job and don't care about customers. They text and talk to each other while people wait in line to get a table. Tried to get in with a table of seven the other night. Place was more than half empty on a Friday night at 8 PM. We were told it would be an hour wait. We were the only ones in the lobby and way more than half the tables were empty. We were told that business had been very slow so they laid off their wait staff and the problem was no waiters to serve the tables. We were told we were welcome to stand in the lobby for an hour and wait to sit. We told them we were in no hurry and that we would be happy to sit at a table and wait for service. We were told that was \"against their policy\". Really. Walked out and had a great dinner at a little Italian restaurant in the same shopping center. Spent well over $200 for a nice casual dinner. Decided to go back and let the manager know what happened so he could better train his hostess and wait staff. The place was dead empty by 9 PM. Manager confirmed it was his policy not to seat anyone even if table were open. Bad idea. These people hate their job and don't want customers as it takes away from their socializing time with each other. Plus, they were making fun of other waiters and some of their customers and we could overhear them. This place really just needs to go out of business at this point and let someone open up a great restaurant in this prime location. Everyone from the manager to the employees have no clue about customer service. We have been here many times as have our friends and it had been a decent experience. Last time we went was a couple of months ago and the food was marginal and the service was slow but we thought it might have just been a bad night and decided to give them another chance. Big mistake on our part. They have deteriorated to a place beyond repair. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant years ago (in NY) but since it was christmas eve our choices were limited so we figured we would try it out. Overall it was ok, our service was great and food was fine, all except the mushroom and spinach enchilada. It was filed with corn with 2 mushrooms and maybe 3 pieces of spinach that were miniscule. It was very disappointing. The beef tacos that i ordered with the combo were fine. My advice is just to be prepared to maybe be a bit let down on what you order.  The salsa was a tad bland as well. Nothing horrible overall but food wise nothing really stood out, the service though was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Yeah, \"just OK\" sums it up.  It's not the experience I recall being a somewhat regular customer of this chain (other state) a decade ago. The salsa was the same recipe - or close and is OK but it's not \"hot sauce\" or even close. The chips were just chunked up corn tortillas and very uninspired. I remember the chips as being a bit better.   On the positive: prices are reasonable for what you get. The dining area was clean. The hostess was friendly. We were greeted and seated right away. A trainee server with a shadow appeared quickly to take drink orders. They were friendly. The meals arrived as ordered. The fajitas and their \"Borderito\" were both \"OK.\"   That's kind of where the positives end.  Endless beans and rice with the fajitas were in massive bowls which seems like a waste since they are \"endless.\" The rice was over-cooked and the beans were bland and had no seasoning at all. Boring.  It was late on a weeknight. The dining area was pretty empty though some late-night regulars were making their way in. This didn't take away from other guests but it's clear there are friendships. In truth, that's probably a good thing. Staff outnumbered guests.  Service was slow out of the kitchen. Follow up for beverage refills was slow. The check was presented with the suggestion that if other drinks or dessert was wanted, the tab could be updated. We asked for to-go boxes (I did say the food was OK), the bill folio was presented on top of one of the open to-go boxes. Nasty! That is contamination and is a training issue that must be addressed.  I've never viewed On The Border (or any of the other Mexican food chains) as a place to go for anything even close to authentic. I go to places like this because they aren't expensive and they have food - usually - with a bit of Mexican-inspired spice and flavor to them. But, On The Border doesn't even measure up on this low standard compared to history.  I think there are better options in the Valley for similar prices."}
{"text":"Great food for the money and clean. So much better than other competitors like Chilis. Friendly employees who always take care of me. No complaints here!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is so BAD. I will never go back here. The prices were too high to have such horrible food. The meat was flavorless and the tacos were so bad!!"}
{"text":"Good fajitas and that's what I stick with when I go here (which is very rare) but ridiculously overpriced for the amount of meat you get. This place never seems busy and its bc the prices and spotty service IMO."}
{"text":"Really? This place is just okay. Everything was way too salty and the waitress was terrible. If you feel like shoving large amounts of food down your esophagus quickly, this is the place."}
{"text":"I've had good food here before, but this visit was a complete fail. We were seated promptly in a recently cleaned booth complete with wet seats. After getting napkins to dry off a place to sit, we were greeted by our server. Nice, solicitous, nervous, really good at apologizing, which will come in handy as the evening progresses. Ordered drinks which took a long time to arrive. Might not have noticed except the server apologized twice. Ordered food, which took a really, really long time to arrive. Might not have noticed, except the server apologized several more times. The restaurant was not that busy, but I can only think that the kitchen was in chaos. The poor server telegraphed his anxiety about what was happening like a public service announcement. Food finally arrived and was barely warm. Chile Relleno looked like a corn dog. We asked for both black and refried beans and got only black. Why give choice of beans if it is served \"family style\" and only one style served? Gave up on fixing that. Burrito was dry. Asked for side of sour cream and guacamole. Got about a tablespoon of each. Gave up on getting more. 2 different people asked if we wanted a take out box, we said yes, no box delivered. After long wait, server picked up payment, asked again if we wanted a box. This time we said no thanks. Server returned with bill and a box (!??). He apologized again. This place is off my list for now. Whatever disaster is happening in the kitchen needs to get fixed quickly!"}
{"text":"Pretty much my favorite chain Mexican food. Although you have a lot of choice for great Mexican food in the area, it's a pretty good place and has a lot of menu choices"}
{"text":"Taco bell quality for restaurant prices. Chips are extremely salty and portions are small."}
{"text":"It's very American Mexican food but for the most part its good .The portions are large the salsa is good all the food is fresh so that's a plus atleast just try this place once."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Our waiter was so great. The food was good and we got a lot for a good price. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very good place for an afternoon lunch.  My guest and I  each ordered the classic burrito, one with chicken, one with steak.  The steak burrito seemed to be abundant with meat.  The chicken, not so much. Still tasted good.  Of course you have the unlimited chips and salsa beforehand which is great.  The chips here are huge and perfect. Light and crispy with just the right amount of salt. The salsa seemed to have a little kick, but after the initial burn, you get used to it. I checked in with Yelp when we got there and surprise, I got free queso!!! Thank you Yelp!!! The queso was delicious. I even put some on my burrito. There are several sauces to choose from to top your burrito. I played it safe and went with the sour cream sauce. Good choice. Also, your entree comes with unlimited beans and rice, but you'll be too full to eat them all. I must mention, I ordered a side of guacamole and it literally was a tablespoon of it. A little disappointing since I love guac. The people were all very friendly, the establishment was clean, food was hot and fresh and quick to the table.  Worth a shot if you're in the area.  9/9/17 Had a wonderful lunch again. This time I got the shredded beef in my burrito. Great choice as the meat was incredibly flavorful and tons of it! Way better than the chicken. I also got the queso sauce on top. Yum, yum, yum.  Chips and salsa were amazing yet again. Our server, Nick with the short hair, was great, very attentive and friendly. This restaurant has improved over the years. I will definitely be going back. And thank you to Yelp! I got 20% off my bill for checking in. I  love you Yelp!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Their food is alright, but service is awful! Our waitress forgot our soup and didn't apologize and simply asked if we wanted her to take it off the check. She also forgot my guacamole, again no apology, and still put it on the check! We had to ask for silverware and it took an exceptionally long time to get our entrees. Called with this feedback and the managed did apologize, but we will not be going back here ever. We get better service at places like Baja Taco, Roberto's, and Leticia's and all those places are cheaper."}
{"text":"My favorite way to treat myself. The big burrito's are the best thing ever, and I love their on the house salsa and chips. The atmosphere is always fun. Enjoyable visit every time."}
{"text":"I like OTB because it's consistent. We go to OTB for Endless Enchiladas every year and they are always excellent no matter which version you choose. Couple that with great chips and salsa (with a hint of fire roasted flavor), and you get a great place to burn a few hours with family or friends. The atmosphere is 'modern southwestern' with interesting decorations on the walls. The Cantina has great happy hour deals nightly and the pitcher of house margaritas with a sangria swirl is a must try...highly recommended, and only $12 during happy hour. Hurray!"}
{"text":"We go to OTB about 4 - 5 times per month....always sit in the bar area.  Usually there for a light dinner.  Was always happy (we had a \"regular\" waitress whom I cannot recall her name, but she was awesome)...lately, it seems to be someone different each time.  The past few visits have been a comedy of errors.  One dinner completely forgotten and was brought out after the other person was completely finished with theirs and three times (including last night) cold food that should have been hot had to be sent back.  Last night, it was something simple...French fries.  They were COLD...who knows when they came out of the fryer.  Waitress was nice....guy who brought the food out and then took the French fries back for fresh ones was a jerk.  OTB is convenient, but definitely thinking of finding a new place.  Wondering if the management has changed."}
{"text":"Great service, fast and v attentive. Crystal was our server, was on top of things and got great sales pitches ;)  Thank you"}
{"text":"I've heard about the great chips at \"On The Border\" in the Bay Area but have never been. This is how I justify picking a chain for dining out of state when other choices might have been better. I'm a chip-n-salsa whore...deal with it.   The chips and salsa delivered! Huge thin, fresh, warm and tasty. Salsa was great too. Then the extra sweet waitress brought this hot melted queso crack sauce that nearly had me dancin' for momma.  All of this was sooooo good, I totally spaced on menu focus and ordered a dinner I knew I wouldn't like--and I didn't. It was like build your own taco melts or something but I didnt fault them with that. The black beans and rice that came with were good enough for me.   And of course, being in the South...it was all washed down with sweet tea. YUM. Loved the convo and Chakira blasting in the background.  It's a decent chain folx...try it."}
{"text":"Slow service and the food is not worth the prices. If you want TexMex style there are a lot of better choices in town."}
{"text":"As I pulled into The Promenade I was torn between checking out two restaurants for lunch, so I did the flip of a quarter to determine my destination. And, I wish it landed the other way after lunch today. I arrived shortly after 12 and was greeted at the door at which time I said seating for 1 and the server pointed me to the booths in the bar & said \"There should be a menu on the table\". Okay, so I seated myself and was approached by Matthew, the waiter with no personality. I ordered my drink and was brought chips and salsa. The chips were cold, and very hard. The salsa was decent, however I had to add salt to both, very bland.  I decided to order the lunch chicken fajitas, my staple item to test Mexican restaurants.   After waiting over 25 minutes my food arrived, with a little bit of a smell & a look of fajitas right out of a frozen bag. The chicken was decent, but I think I make chicken better. The peppers and onions were pretty raw, so I decided to press them on the sizzling grill, hoping to cook them a little more. As for the rice & beans, disgusting, both! Refried beans should be mashed, these were like charro beans, ugh! And, the rice, cold and bland. As for the tortillas, very doughy and the cheese came right our of a package.  The ultimate disappointment! I will definitely stick with the non-chain Mexican restaurants. They continue to remain traditional and serve nothing bland, out of a bag... Not saying that On The Border does, but it sure tasted like they do."}
{"text":"Tucked in Promenade next door to the Macaroni Grille is On the Border Cantina.  It's a pretty typical Mexican place with a predictable menu.    The decor is pretty cheesy with over-done Mexican theming throughout.  It really feels like some corporate big-wig in Chicago said, \"If it's stereotypical Mexican, it's for us!\"  The bright colored tiles, clay colored flooring, really is eye-roll worthy.  The staff was fine, and the drink specials they have are worth checking out.  $2 draft beers, and $3 house margaritas?  definitely the best feature.  Several patrons obviously had figured this out as the bar area had a little micro crowd of folks taking advantage of cheap booze and free chips and salsa.  The food unfortunately, is nothing to write home about and left our entire table with a brick in our stomachs for the rest of the evening.  The chips aren't fresh, and taste blah, my pork tacos, which were the special so they had to be fresh, right?  RIGHT??? were average at best.  They were topped with some sort of chili and supposedly some roasted corn and other veg... I had maybe 3 kernels of corn on each taco, and the chili stuff on top seemed awfully like it had been frozen at some point - it was very visually unappealing, bland, and flat-out disappointing.  Overall, this place is a step above a Taco Bell and should change its name to Mexican Applebees."}
{"text":"I have sadly been to this On the Border more than once due to family members liking it. I just don't get it. The food here is substandard 'Mexican' that tastes extremely salty and is loaded with sodium, calories, and fat (their fish tacos have over 1800 calories... whoa). Their portions are outrageously large. Don't bother looking at their nutritional facts, it will make you sad.... And yes, I get it , Americanized Mexican food is generally bad for you, but at least it tastes good at other restaurants. To their credit, they do have a 'healthy' menu that lists the calories, unfortunately this food is also not very good. On my most recent visit, I got the 'healthy' combo with an enchilada and fajita taco with a side of grilled veg. The veg was fine, the taco tasted like they dumped a bunch of that lime juice that comes in the green bottle all over some prepackaged precooked chicken slices... not awesome, but made better by adding some of the grilled veg and some salsa to it. The enchilada was also nothing special, but not terrible. The husband's enchiladas were a 'salt lick.' A family member ordered the guac, which they made table side. I don't even know how they could make fresh guac so flavorless. I would not recommend on the border to anyone and am keeping my fingers crossed that I will not have to make a return visit."}
{"text":"I know this is not authentic Mexican food; but still, it's Tex-Mex that is really, really good. The patio seating in the bar area is nice.   Their salsa is spicy so be forewarned if you have a problem with heat; but I think it's the best salsa in the valley. The rice is also slightly buttery with corn and is addictive.  You should try: - Fajita quesadillas - Beef empanadas - Fajitas - SW chicken tacos (w/onion ring and chipotle crema) - Beef enchiladas with ranchero sauce - Dessert: sizzling apple crisp"}
{"text":"Meal began with chips and salsa. I can be known to be a picky salsa person, I can happily report that the salsa was pretty good. Just a hint if heat which is good for me.   Since it is taco Tuesday I decided I should go for the tacos. I had a roasted chicken taco. It was very flavorful. I would order it again.   Husband had chicken enchiladas which he enjoyed. He has never been a huge fan of Mexican food, but I am slowly converting him. Rice and beans were also good. If I could give half stars I would rate a 3.5 but since there are no half stars I gave them a 4.   Portion sizes were good for us. My son would probably want bugger, but for us it was good."}
{"text":"The best enchiladas. The sour cream sauce is unique for Mexican food. Great service. Join the club and get great coupons via email."}
{"text":"My all time favorite Mexican restaurant. I've been eating here for years. Their burritos and fajitas are AMAZING. If you're in the mood for dessert, get the border brownie. It is the best brownie I have ever had in my life. My husband and I are definitely regulars. Everyone is ALWAYS so friendly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and people are amazing! The best service i have received. Clean, fun, friendly, and great Guacamole.   It was my birthday and originally expected to go to another location but i am extremely happy we stumbled on this location. They went above and beyond good customer service and that is why i rated them so high.   If you have not tried their Guac please do, its made every 4 hours and is delicious."}
{"text":"Meeeh.... The food was pretty bland. I was pretty unimpressed and the price was too high. My server/bartender Josh was great. Super nice service, just super blah food. No spice, small portions."}
{"text":"Average. Very nice staff, though. I ordered a beef fajita salad. There were 5-6 small strips of beef, and by cutting them in half, that means 10 bites of steak in a sea of lettuce. And of course, the obligatory 99¢ for a dab of sour cream. Not good value. I'll find another place. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I had not been back to this restaurant in probably 6 years and I will never go back again.  Over priced and just plain bad food.  Carpet had not been swept up and looked dirty.  Queso dip was on the salty side and lukewarm.  Guacamole was just ok.  Cheese and onion enchiladas-for $10.89 there was very, very little cheese and onion.  The enchiladas Suizas were not very good and lukewarm.  The rice was totally inedible.  Someone went way overboard with the cumin(?) Whatever it was, it was overpowering and bitter.   Mexican rice is really hard to mess up but this was just awful.  The Mexican beans were at least tasty and hot.  Overall overpriced and not good.  I think you can have all the rice and beans you want.  If it tastes nasty, then you aren't going to eat much are ya? Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This restaurant is off my list for good. There was a time in different states that I would have considered them pretty good. Things have changed and it appears to be nationwide. The service was terrible...we received the \"what do you want, your bothering me\" attitude from our young female server on an early Saturday night last weekend. Our biggest clue should have been the now hiring sign that we joked about in the parking lot hoping it wasn't cooks. Our order was incorrect and I'm fairly positive the chicken in my 3 sauce burrito was frozen. It was perfectly cubed and had a squishy consistency. My friends veggie burrito came with chunks of partially cooked zucchini, squash and red peppers. The rice was just as bad. The only thing I found appealing were the re fried beans.  Add a $5 draft beer and voila, unhappy customer."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often especially on the national holidays like Tequila day, margarita day, taco day, etc and it's usually a hit or miss. When the special is involving just the drinks it's pretty fast & friendly service but when it's food like on National Taco day it's a hot mess all around from wait time to service to losing orders smh. This location gets a 2.5 and if I ever go back it would be solely for the drink specials."}
{"text":"Well, I went to this restauraunt on my brother's birthday, said it was great, so me and my parents decided to go.. After receiving a basket of chips, I almost got full since they were so good! I ordered 2 tacos with no cheese which came out to $8.99.. Okay price but the food should have been better than any other mexican restauraunt that serves tacos... My tacos were outstanding, the rice was a bit cold, my beans were also cold and didn't taste right."}
{"text":"So I have been going to OTB for 17 years.  Withing the past year they reduced the portion sizes on everything and kept the price the same.   Tonight sealed the deal for me.   I will no longer eat here because my favorite dish was cut, the meat was a very small portion and overcooked.  Price of course was the same.   Manager said that is what corporate has been doing.  Cutting portion size and still charging the same price.     Voting with my feet and wallet I am finished with restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for create your own combo and huge margaritas. I liked the plain ones frozen( they aren't afraid to pour the tequila in these babies)!!  Chips and salsa are very good, although not hot at all, so we would always pour hot sauce in to add a little heat. The cheese stuffed chile rellenos were good and cheesy, and the soft tacos were pretty good along with the empanadas.  Burritos are huge! Not really a fan of the beans, but you get to choose from refried or black beans, and they have other choices like veggies instead as sides.:)   Very good prices, servers are very friendly and would go back for the margs:) I would say 3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Didn't want to give a rating because we never got to order, so ignore my one star. I gave no rating because we couldn't get to the point to order food. We were ready to order our lunch when she brought our drinks and said she would be right back...but then went to get orders from the 2 other tables who had yet to order yet. No clue how much my ice tea cost, but left $2.50 on the table and left. Not good for a lunch . Waitress was nice, hostess was clueless (we were the last people she sat and left without eating and she cheerily said, \"thanks for coming!\" This is why I try to avoid chains at all cost"}
{"text":"The fajitas are still good and service was fine. Just don't really like the new \"Family Style\" sharing of beans and rice. Maybe I want my own rice and beans, eh? I'm sure it's a cost-cutting measure and probably saves on waste as well, but I don't like to share :) For the most part though, I must add, the rest of my group thought the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great service, love the chips and salsa. Lots of food for the price."}
{"text":"I love this place especially on Tuesdays!! Such great deals!   We discovered their all day Taco Tuesday deal a couple of weeks ago. $2-4 tacos all day and they are hefty tacos too with the fixins included (not just meat). I go for the $2 veggie tacos, they have nicely seasoned squash, zucchini and bell peppers. For veggie tacos, that's ridiculously awesome. My boyfriend likes the $2 chicken tinga tacos.. Also big and flavorful. This is your place is you want to celebrate Taco Tuesday.   The happy hour prices are amazing as well. I have posted pics of all deals, I gottchu. The happy hour deals are valid during Taco Tuesday as well, double score. Very reasonably priced drinks though I've discovered  the margaritas are too sweet for me. We stick to the $3 shots and $4 22oz dos equis. The white queso is my favorite item on the HH food menu.   This place definitely won't let you down. And shout out to our server Neil, he is super awesome.. Everyone can learn a few things about customer service from this guy! Plus he whips up a mean and spicy salsa, yum. Amazing job, keep it up."}
{"text":"We had the best time at OTB! We came in on the day after Christmas to have a few drinks and a bite. Melissa the bartender was very friendly and attentive. We chatted with her quite a bit and she made the best Mercedes margaritas. I informed her that I used to work at OTB and she brought the manager Christian over. He stood and talked with us for 10 minutes and was wonderful. We felt like we were at home. At the end we handed Melissa our credit card and she came back and told us we had an unexpected discount. I'm telling you it's service like this that the industry is lacking but not here! We will be back. Wonderful place. Also happy hour is Sunday through Friday 3 to close but they always have certain bar and drink specials. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Good service. The food is just ok. Kind of hit or miss depending on what you order."}
{"text":"Recommended !! From the service to the food, everything was so great, our server Antonio was amazing ! And the manager Maurice was great when we asked for special tacos for our kids ! Thank you ! Well done On the border !"}
{"text":"One of the best mexican restaurants for chips and salsa! Whenever I come here I always get their grilled fish taco with side of double rice. Hands down!"}
{"text":"We headed to Stapley branch first only to find out they were closed! It was opened only 2 wks ago though, crazy! Then off to Power location, called and were told current wait time is 45mins! Still we went and passed by a very crowded parking area with bystanders outside On the Border entrance. We dint know where to go for dinner so we called again and asked for any bar seating. We arrived and proceeded to the bar with 2 available seats - we skipped the 45min wait and that was amazing..  I had Big Borduritto (?),  portion was indeed big lol.  Their salsa, which is bottomless, is similar to Chili's but is too spicy for my taste but I liked their chips better than Chili's. Overall the Big Burrito I had was ok, I will probably try a different one next time we head visit the place again. Taste was nothing extraordinary but they were not bad either."}
{"text":"Service stunk...food stuck...overall, wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Question: WTH happened to this place? We used to love this place. Always brought out of town guests here, and pretty much ate here once a week. Had to take a break from them because their service had gotten SO BAD. REALLY BAD!   On top of that, none of my favorite meals are on the new menu. I've yet to find anything on the new menu that I would order again. Which is really a mute point, because after the service we received last night, we will never be returning!"}
{"text":"Came in today Steve serverd me. Sold me something called a melt down in my margarita it was great with the grand Marnie"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!  First off there were six dirty tables that no one had bussed in the bar area when we were seated and they remained dirty until around thirty minutes after being seated. It took our server more than ten minutes to come to our table after more than twenty minutes of being seated we realized no ever brought us our chips and salsa so we had to ask for them.  My friend ordered a salad and never received it.  The food was good customer service sucked worst ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Service really sucked took awhile for us to get seated even though the restaurant wasn't that busy food was just ok... But a little over priced for the quality. Most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for years, and always wanted to give it a try.  I finally tried it this weekend, and found out that I should have kept driving past it.  The food was disappointing, even by my low TexMex expectations.  It took forever for the food to come out, and our server never checked on us after the food was on the table.  Bad food, bad service.  I don't usually give a one star review, but this place does not have any positives."}
{"text":"Good, solid Mexican food with a semi-healthy slant.  Don't know what the other Yelpers were complaining about when they talked about poor service--perhaps they went on a Friday night when the place was completely packed and the servers were crazy busy??  My experiences here have been the polar opposite--GREAT service!    Today our server brought us free queso dip (AMAZING!!), refilled our drinks before they were even halfway empty, and brought each person at our table their own bowl of salsa.  She even remembered us from ONE previous visit--pretty awesome if you ask me!    I just love their enchiladas!  Great vegetarian options too--definitely try the cheese/onion and mushroom/spinach ones if you're not a fan of meat.  Love their black beans and Mexican rice (which comes with corn in it--yum!).  Good chips and salsa; we always get the table-side guacamole too.  And if you have room for dessert, the sopapillas (with a side of vanilla ice cream) are totally worth the extra calories!  ;)"}
{"text":"Veggie fajitas were 100! Our server Robert was so friendly and made sure we had everything we needed! He was on his A game even when we came in late after a huge rush just left. Thanks to Robert we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"If you like dog food then I highly recommend this restaurant.  This is worst food I have had in a long time.  Nothing more I can really say."}
{"text":"I don't typically write a review for a chain or even dig their food that much, but On The Border is pretty darn good.  IF you like your Mexican food soooo covered in cheese and kinda greasy (and some folks do, that's fine!) - this probably isn't the place for you.  It's just lighter and fresher.  I like that.  I love that I can substitute the beans and rice for grilled veggies and that you can get cilantro rice instead of Spanish rice.  I also like variety, so instead of a plate of three enchiladas, I enjoy their 'choose 2' or 'choose 3' - I get a salad (GREAT salad with black beans, corn, cilantro, cheese, tomato - it's a great side salad, pretty big too!), a cup of tortilla soup, and one enchilada - plus I substitute the grilled veggies (usually zuke, red pepper, etc.) for the beans and rice.  Chips and salsa are right up there too.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went here last week with a party of 5. When we walked in the door and asked about Happy Hour we were told it only applied to the bar and to a couple of tables in the vicinity of the bar. WTF!!!  The only table near the bar that met the Happy hour rules was one that had the high chairs. I'm short and overweight and can't get into those chairs so we had to sit at a table away from the bar and out of the Happy hour zone.   Luckily we had a true gentleman in our party (Thank you Rick) that went to the bar and got our drinks, twice.  I'm not even sure the table we sat at was even clean as the chairs were not pushed in and it made the table look a mess.   That being said, the food wasn't bad. Average, non exceptional. It was meh!!  I don't think I'll go back just because of their stupid happy hour rules. There are other places that serve the same food without the happy hour restrictions. Maybe I was soured on the place from the beginning but I've never heard of the happy hour pricing not extending to the whole restaurant. Good luck people."}
{"text":"The service is always great and accommodating (love unsalted fresh tortilla chips). However, the menu is basic and not amazing. Tip: less greasy meals, frijoles de la olla, homemade salsa and steamed vegetables please!"}
{"text":"Always a nice spot to grab a drink after work. Quest dip is one of my favorites along with the southwestern chicken tacos. Our bartender and server tonight was Liz and she did an awesome job accommodating us while running the bar top and making everyone's drinks tonight. Thank you Liz!!"}
{"text":"First let me tell you that I love Mexican food, I've eaten some in Mexico as well as Arizona, and I have developed a good palette for 'spicy.' However - I go to a restaurant like On The Border the same way a film buff should approach a Michael Bay movie. I know what I'm getting and I'm not going to act all surprised when it's not the best I've ever had.  That said - I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to On The Border and would return in a heartbeat (especially for happy hour).  Went with a girlfriend for happy hour and ordered a half-price appetizer in the form of their steak quesadilla. It was very large despite the price and really delicious. I used to have a few quesadillas a week during my \"cheese, cheese, and more cheese\" phase growing up - so I hold quesadillas to a pretty high standard. This was a delicious start to the meal.  The girlfriend ordered the pulled-pork baja fajita with salsa, I ordered the chimichanga with beef and queso underneath. Couldn't resist a Dos Equis Ambar for $2.25. They brought it in a goblet that was frozen and as a result there was a bit of slush at the top of the glass but really, when your only complaint is that \"the beer was too cold,\" you know you've had a good dinner.  I had a few bites of hers and completely devoured mine, which was an impressive feat considering I had eaten most of the quesadilla earlier. Everything was delicious and tasted very fresh. The queso under my chimichanga added just the right amount of spice and I was lucky to have arctic-chilled brew in arm's reach.  Like Rand before me, I'm not exactly surprised by the negative reviews I've read for this location but that certainly wasn't my personal experience at this On The Border. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The mango coronarita was yummy but that was all that I liked. The food was not very good to me. I got a chicken & cheese stuffed fried avocado, chicken enchilada, and refried beans w/ rice. The avocado had no flavor, the enchilada comes with some kind of white sauce (should have asked) I like mine with green sauce and again no flavor really. The refried beans have this smoke flavor and that's all you taste, If I want smoky I'll hit up bbq. Rice was eh not much to rave about there. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We thought we would give it one more chance, but that turned out to be a mistake. We both had to send our food back. And, what canme back really wasn't much better. With another new Mexican restaurant just down the street there is no need to come back."}
{"text":"I love this On the Boarder. They have the friendliest staff. On the rare occasion there's an issue, management does an amazing job taking care of us. Allen was our server today and did Awesome job taking care of all 5 of us. Loved the watermelon margarita."}
{"text":"We normally go here for a quick happy hour. Today is was a SAD HOUR!!! Service sucked and they ran out of the chicken wing special!!! Lololol!"}
{"text":"Food was good and service is semi family style with endless beans and rice. Eric took great care of us and made it a great  meal.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Decent prices, just like other On The Border restaurants. We sat at the bar and avoided the wait. Free cheese dip at check-in on Yelp. Who doesn't love FREE cheese dip?!?  Plus the free salsa was tasty! Grande house margarita was delicious and buzz-worthy. Would definitely visit this location again! $33 for large amber Dos Equis draft, large house margarita, one chicken bowl, a la carte Bean burrito with red sauce, free salsa, and free cheese dip with Yelp check in."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are good but other than that it's worse than a drive through Federico's."}
{"text":"One thing I love about the corporate restaurant model is that service is often reliably better than the local places.  This is true at On the Border.  I love the good service, including the fake smiles, memorized greetings, and checking on my table a little too often.  Fine with me.  I usually opt for the make your own burrito and results are usually quite good, and the same goes for the veggie fajitas.  Whether the tortilla chips are made here or not, I like the thickness & crispness."}
{"text":"We ordered a cup of Queso, fish tacos, and Margaritas.  The service was extremely slow. The Queso showed up only a minute before our meal.  We had to ask twice for chips before we got a bowl of broken pieces.  I drank my Margarita  and the waiter asked if I wanted another one, to which I said yes.  Never received it. We had to ask for utensils. I asked for some extra sauce for the tacos when he brought them to the table. Ten minutes later, I had to ask again.  He never came back to pickup our ticket and credit card, so I pulled out exact cash and coins and we left."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service is great! I love that you can sit on the patio area and have a nice cooling must over you. The food here is pretty mediocre. It just tastes like a typical chain restaurant which is not really my thing. I won't be rushing back anytime soon, however I wouldn't avoids going there either."}
{"text":"The food is good, it's the service that makes this place great! Melissa was awesome, she brought everything I needed before I asked and really knew her food and drink menu. Will be coming back to see her soon!"}
{"text":"Aaron was a delight to has a server for our evening. He made my husband's birthday very memorable by bring a compted dessert. He recommend dishes on the menu and was very confident in his suggestions. We loved how upbeat and fun he was. Such an energetic person. Keep up the good work! The food was also delicious! For a 10pm order the chef did a great job preparing the food. So much flavor and tenderness to the meats. Thank you to all!"}
{"text":"I order queso for an appetizer and it was awful.  I had to send it back.  It tasted like the plastic wrap had melted into it.  The server was nice about it and switched the app to table-side guacamole.  It was okay, but not worth the $8.99 price tag.  My meal was a taco salad.  The first time it arrived the meat was cold.  More than just not hot, it was cold like straight from the refrigerator.  I sent it back and got a slightly better version.  When the bill came, both the salad and the queso were included at full price. I had to ask the server to remove the queso.  I would have expected them to remove the salad or at least offer a free dessert or coupon.  I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Crappy service would be an improvement here. Multiple requests for chips, queso and drinks went unanswered. Will never be back here"}
{"text":"The service, chips and salsa were fine then it all went South.  I had the La Bandera (3 enchiladas) and all of them were tasteless and the meat was tough.  I went because I had a gift card.  As much as I love free meals I would gladly have paid double for good food."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of On the Border!  Their chips and salsa are like crack... it's hard to stop once you start snacking on them while waiting on your main order.  Some of my co-workers used to frequent this location a lot since its close to the office, but I have started to bring my lunch more.  We do our large group get-together lunches here and it's fairly reasonable in price.  I'm a big sucker for tex-mex food anyways so On the Border is always in my list of options when considering going out to eat for lunch (when I don't bring my lunch).  Their lunch pick 2 combo is a favorite of mine.  Get a ton of food for a decent price and you can mix it up so it's hard not to get bored with this restaurant!  The only drawback to this location is during big races, it's really hard to get in and out of the Concord Mills/Speedway Blvd area.  One time we were there for lunch and our server said to \"stay away\" for the race that coming weekend.  I thought it was funny, but she was just trying to save us from the hair-ripping, frustrating traffic jam situations that the races cause in the area."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Wednesday evening. Not to busy....which is always my first concern..but I gave it the benefit of the doubt since growing up this place had great food and service. Well that was shut down real quick.   The service was really good our waitress Ria was super accommodating and agreed with us when we had issues with the food. She really made sure we were getting what we paid for and that our experience was good. However, the issue came along when we ordered the pick two fajitas. Steak and chicken was our choice.   When it came out the server boy or whatever you call him...kept yelling our order like we were incompetent humans and if we didn't answer right away he would get super frustrated and just push our plate in front of someone. He also cussed in front of a table full of children. Mind you there were 8 of us..so patients is the key with big parties everyone knows that. ON top of that the steak was four of the thinnest pieces of steak I have ever seen...it looked like bird food. Here to find out they weigh their food and cheat you out of it...so that's disappointing. I mean this place is no where I will be going back to especially with a person who cusses in front children OVER FOOD!!!! Come on people!  The only reason I would go back is for Ria's service but nothing else."}
{"text":"WOW YOU MUST EAT HERE!! Great food and even better service!!  The warm chips and delicious, spicy salsa kept coming.  The food was really good Mexican style food that came on HOT plates and was beautifully presented.  The kids meal even comes with an ice cream sundae.  The best thing about our meal was that JESSICA'S service was the best service EVER!  She filled our drinks often, checked on us often, made sure we knew food, chips, or drink refills were on their way, and was very friendly to us and our 3 year old.  So respectful and courteous that we felt welcomed to be there because of the great atmosphere.  Thanks for the delicious food and the AWESOME service!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dinner was going great until a cockroach ran down the back of my seat. Got the hell out of there. The waitress was really nice and apologetic. We weren't charged. Didn't even think to tip her as I rushed out. My oldest tried to bring the rest of his home. Hell no. Will not be back."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I decided to go out for Mexican and decided to go to \"On The Border\" as it was close to home and typically has great food and good service. Tonight blew away our expectations and we had great food and the best service we've ever had from a server.   Nicholas ( our server ) was the most attentive and helpful server in our history of visiting restaurants. Ever. Anytime we were low on chips and salsa, drinks, or other needs; he was immediately there with a refill. He provided me recommendations on meals so that I could try something new. He was extremely polite, and even gave a bit of a bow as he left to continue his rounds with other customers and each time he returned he always greeted us with a smile.  After the meal was over he was quick with helping to process the check and even brought our to-go boxes neat and organized to make it easier to store our remaining food.  I would recommend visiting this location and asking for Nicholas as your server!"}
{"text":"I went here on National Margarita Day with two of my friends. They were running a special for $2 house margaritas and $5 coronaritas! We all opted for the $2 house margaritas. The waitress then suggested we each get an additional shot on the side that was only \"a dollar more.\" We all agreed and ordered them. When our bill came, the additional shots that were only \"a dollar more\" were actually $1.39 each. It was not a big deal, but obviously for some people something like that might be. We ordered 3 rounds, so it ended up being another $5 or so on our bill which wasn't a big deal. This is also one of those restaurants that does not list the price of drinks on their drink menu.   We just ordered some appetizers with our drinks which came out fast and all tasted good. We got a special loaded nacho that was a featured item, chicken fajita quesadilla, and queso dip.   This is located on the outskirt of the Concord Mills Mall which means it can definitely get BUSY at times. When we arrived it looked like there was going to be a long wait, but luckily everyone ahead of us seemed to be large parties and we were seated right away."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location almost right after they opened. I always enjoyed their food and service. After all these years, I keep on coming back for more! Jeanine was our favorite server until she moved to the Mesa location and now we have  Christine who is always on top of her game!  A couple of  suggestions: Easy on the salt! you can always add salt to the chips. I assume most people like salty chips but If you decide to stop adding salt to the chips, announce it as part of a \"healthier decision\". The second suggestion is to have a mild salsa if your only salsa is going to be this hot. (I always put a sugar packet to make it milder). Your new additions to the menu are tasty and well made. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I always thought I didn't like On the Border but apparently they have converted me.   They have happy hour Monday - Thursday and have $4 margaritas. This won me over hands down. Forget everything else.   They have these jalapeno poppers that are stuffed with cheese and chicken and fried in a tempura batter. So good. These suckers are delicious.  And you can't go wrong with their chips and salsa. So fresh and tasty.  Our server was good for the most part. We sat around and had to wait on utensils a bit but she got busy. Our food came out hot and as ordered and we had no complaints about the food.  I would definitely return even if just for happy hour and appetizers."}
{"text":"Went here wit my BB- We had fresh chips & salsa and it was on point...We had the tacos platter wit different meats n each taco...it was aight...But the drinks and the chips & salsa were it...Might do a repeat jus 4 the drinks, chips & salsa...The food...Eh, prolly gotta try sumthin different next time around..."}
{"text":"On the Border....of food. Something to say when the rice was the best tasting part of the meal. I ordered the Queso Chicken....the chicken was burnt and completely covered in what I would call ballpark nacho cheese....I'm not joking. Mildly spiced, Velveta covered burnt chicken. The rice,...unseasoned, unflavored, and the best thing on the plate.  Two stars due to the margarita..."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try this place for the first time. The ambiance was okay. Both of us ordered the bowls - I had the portobello mushroom bowl and she had one with shrimp. We were a little disappointed on the serving size for the price paid. The waiter goofed up my order as usual - maybe because the dude didn't write my order down. Would love to give a higher rating but was not impressed. Felt sorry for my wife because she was actually still hungry after consuming her dish. Ended up dropping by the Chick-fil-a for some chicken strips to make it better."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what the heck happened tonight, let's just start off with the fact that it took our server Francisco 10 minutes to come and greet us he took our order and the queso came out which is all great but we didn't have any chips so our server Francisco had said oh I'll be right back with some chips about 8 minutes pass we still don't have chips and our queso got cold, I finally then tracked down Francisco and he then proceeded to ask us if we need anything i then looked at him and said Uhm chips? He then said \"oh they didn't bring it out yet?\" Obviously not Francisco obviously not, at that point i asked him to bring back the queso because it was cold. Our food then comes out (beef fajita) our server than tells us that they're making tortillas and he'll bring some over when they come out. About 15 minutes pass and he brings tortillas to the table behind us with the fajitas while we're still waiting. Francisco eventually had come out and went to the table next to us and that table had said i think that table is waiting for something he then again had asked us if we needed anything and we said Tortillas and a few other things we thought he could handle he then said \"wait they didn't bring them out yet.\" My friend had said no, and just for the future don't bring tortillas to another table with their fajitas while we're still waiting. With this waiting time my fajitas got cold so I asked if they could make a new one and Francisco re heated which then burned all of the onions and peppers on the plate. On a side note bartender working tonight was fabulous, great margarita making."}
{"text":"Tasteless and bad service by far this is the worst mexican restaurant. Menu is limited and just plain. Try other mexican restaurants instead."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. The foods been good and customer service has been decent. The food is very Americanized and not authentic, but I knew that before ever going. The margaritas are delish and they are good about keeping chips on the table."}
{"text":"My oldest daughter took her mom and sister out for a belated Mother's Day lunch to On the Border on Bell Rd. I stayed at home and waited for any left overs. When they returned, they gave me a bag that was quite heavy and I thought they felt bad for me so they purchased an entire entree for me. Wrong...It was their left over entree's. I was hungry so I opened the bag and sadly discovered about 7 lbs. of what tasted like canned refried beans and partially eaten enchiladas and burritos. None of it was flavorful cold so I reheated it in the microwave and there was absolutely no improvement in flavor so I tossed it. Sounded like a brick when it landed! YUK!!! Save the trip and go to Fry's and get some $.99 Banquet T.V. dinners. I felt really bad for all of them especially on this special occasion! Oh well, at least I know where NOT to go if they take me out for Father's day lunch. I hope my daughter isn't angry at me for writing this but I wanted to give you Yelpers a heads up!  They should rename the restaurant  \"Borderline Mexican Cantina\" Ha Ha"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, on the last day of my trip in AZ for lunch. I already expected how the food will be before I decided to have lunch here but we tried most of the restaurants surrounding us.  Since we didn't have a car on the last day, we walked from our hotel to this restaurant which was across the parking lot. We decided to sit outside, the chairs weren't clean and there were spider webs connecting to the table to the chair.  (skull face emoji)  Walking in, we got greeted, and seated right away.  We had complimentary chips and salsa.  Chips were good.  I ordered the Beef brisket taco comes with two tacos, black beans and rice.  It was alright, meat was a little dry. I also ordered the Soapipilla for dessert, which I really enjoyed.  It came with a side of honey.  It was like a hallow pillow shaped churro.  Comes with 2 for 2.99. I personally don't know if I would ever come back.  But on the bright side our waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"Out shopping with my wife and it was lunch time. I have never been to On the Border so we stepped in and waited. There was many tables open but no one to set you. Finally someone came and seated us. Our waitress came soon after and we ordered. We had to wait to get our tea refilled. Service was slow and, (I just did not feel welcome).  I got a burrito I think my wife got the same.  The food was ok. Eatable. By no means great. In this area there are several very good Mexican Food restaurants. For this reason I have no reason to return to this one. I don't want to sound mean. The food was eatable ok food when you can get great food for the same price and the waitress acts like they are glad you are there.  CHOW (purina)"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Zack was very timely and good was hot and delicious! Loved the kick the salsa has and the fajitas are phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time we dined here. And our experience for a Saturday afternoon was beyond our expectations. Walking in and being greeted and seated in a timely manner. Upon sitting, not even 30 seconds or waitress already brought us chips and salsa and took our drink order.   When we mentioned it was our first time dining here, she offered us a \"sauce sample\" giving us a little taste of all the sauces they offer for specific dishes. She was very attentive, and always had a smile on her face when walking back and fourth attending to other tables or walking out of the kitchen with tables order.   Although the food didnt taste as authentic as I wanted it to be, it was still very delicious ! The only downside is that we ordered an appetizer before our meal but that came out literally seconds before they brought out our meals. So the table was definitely crowded. On the plus side they do offer military discount, which is always nice.   Thank you KATHIE for your wonderful service during our dining experience today !"}
{"text":"Vegetarian: I've eaten at On the Border several times and I always get what I expect. They have pretty extensive vegetarian offerings and will even give you a separate menu with those options; I get something different everytime.   Vegans: Many of the vegetarian options can be modified to exclude cheese and so I would recommend this place to vegans.  Service: it's a typical sit down restaurant. Staff is always friendly and speedy."}
{"text":"I've read several reviews about the slow service and have experienced the same but it seems they've corrected this problem when we were there recently.  The place had a good dinner crowd and we sat in the bar area.  We got served quickly for as crowded as it was.  I got the fish tacos and the wife got the fajita quesadillas .  both were very good.  The only disappointment was the stuffed jalapeño in a light temporary.  The batter was heavy, hard and tough to cut through....you had to chip away at it and it basically fell apart...it appears that it was overcooked ...the filling itself was good but you had to work for it."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. It's gone downhill. Service and food used to be pretty good, now both have gone out the window. I must have heard \"I'm sorry w'ere out of that \"5 times in one visit. I even heard the manager yelling at the staff. Just not a good place to go anymore."}
{"text":"Out of the park once again!  I have yet to come here and have a bad experience!    Had my son come in from California and asked him what kind of food he wanted. He said that he wanted mexican so I immediately thought of On the Border!     We both ordered the ranch bacon chicken fajitas.  OMG... they were so good. There was nothing left from either of our orders to box up. I'm not typically a fajita person... and these were amazing!  I will order them again.   Checked in and got my $5 off the bill without issues.  Brennon did a great job as server tonight!"}
{"text":"Love this place, unlimited chips and salsa, family style beans and rice, it's delish. It is seriously my go-to place for chips and salsa - they make them fresh in house and they're great. Plenty of gluten free options, too, for anyone with special diets. Seriously, this is probably the best Mexican food place in town. The only thing they don't have that I wish they did is tamales, but I know tamales aren't always easy to do, so that's okay. Service can vary, but they do have decent people. And they are almost always good to accommodate a large party, which most places don't, and we love it."}
{"text":"The day before eating at the Providence Rd location, I ate the same luncheon steak fajitas at the Greenville, SC, OnThe Border location. There was no comparison in the two experiences.  Greenville was fantastic in every way. Providence Rd in Charlotte was a fiasco from start to finish. We didn't get chips and salsa when seated. It took forever to receive sour cream that we'd asked to go along with them. The waitress failed to bring my husband's salad until after his main course when we reminded her. She dropped my tortillas for the fajitas and I didn't receive replacements until after she helped two other tables and the steak was cold. The steak was a small amount of stringy, dried-up, gray pieces of meat on a cold plate whereas in G'ville it was a generous serving of thick strips of medium rare meat sizzling on a hot to the touch one.  We had to ask and wait for refills on drinks.
