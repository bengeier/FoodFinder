{"text":"Great restaurant! The entrees were fantastic, the wine list is diverse and the service is great. A+"}
{"text":"Overpriced and terrible service. Had to wait ages for food despite the fact that the restaurant was  almost completely empty when we were seated and only half full when they then claimed a rush of orders in the kitchen. 1 1/2 hours later a mediocre and overpriced pizza arrived. Did I mention it's way overpriced and the service is shit?"}
{"text":"Way too expensive. Too bad because the place has potential but like all the new stuff in the hood, it went OTT."}
{"text":"Jane was really good. Cocktails were good and original, not very boozy though ($10 each). Endive, apple, blue cheese and pistachio salad was nicely sized and fresh ($12). \"Schwartz\" pizza (smoked meat, mustard, cheddar, pickles) sounded awful, but was really, really amazing ($20). This was the standout. Pasta dish was decent and fresh ($19). Two of us shared the above and had almost half a pizza and about half a pasta dish to take home. You can order two starters and share a pizza, easily. Service was friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh!!! You know those days that fill up so quickly with \"stuff\" that you don't even have time to even think of eating? Yeah, well, the day we went to Jane, I forgot to eat lunch. Oops. And our dinner reservation was at 9pm. Double oops.

(But hello, skinny jeans...)

And not taking a cab to Jane at -30 degrees Celsius? How many mistakes can you make in one day!? Snowbanks and heels in the crazy cold. Yeah, I didn't take out my camera for that. Needless to say, when we finally got to the restaurant, we needed our food STAT, we needed it to fill us up, and we definitely needed it to bring us to a warm, happy place.

A total fluke, but Jane was the perfect place for this kind of meal. To begin, my friends had a Caesar salad ($9), which was quite sizeable and quite good. And not swimming in dressing? Amazing! Our luck was changing. We even found little fried potatoes in there. Yum.

They also ordered the crabcakes ($13). I'm not the biggest fan of crabcakes - I rather have just the crab and skip the cake - but they were happy, and enjoyed the cakes' fun spicy kick.

I had the beet salad with melted goat cheese ($11) - big and delicious! Rather than creamy goat cheese spread on the side of the bowl, this salad came with a round cross-section of a goat cheese log. With that were roasted pumpking seeds and arugula. Seriously delicious.

Next, we chose to split the Bianca pizza ($17), made with porcinis, béchamel, buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, pesto and truffle oil. I had heard about Jane's pizza crusts and thought to myself, how good can a pizza really crust be? Answer - better than I ever imagined. Instead of the \"thin whole wheat crust\" we're used to ordering to feel less guilty about indulging in this Italian main, our pizza had a bubbly, chewy, doughy and downright decadent pizza crust. Maybe I could compare it to slightly thicker Naan bread? In any case, the entire pizza was rich and luscious.

Finally, we split the brownie ($7) and the crème brulée ($7) for dessert. Nothing super out of the ordinary, but damn good too.

Jane is small, wood-sy and welcoming. The atmosphere is hip but warm, and the food is all about comfort and taste. It's casual dining at its best.

{"text":"On a Thursday night in August, my husband and I happened upon this three-week-old restaurant south-west of Vieux-Montreal.  The small restaurant seats 20 or so comfortably with additional seating at the bar. The place was a buzz with activity. We did not have reservations and the hostess hesitated before giving us a table. 

Rustic wood floors and brick walls made Jane feel warm and welcoming. The menu, as in many restaurants in Montreal, was written in chalk on a large black board. The food was fresh and seasonal. The main courses were mainly pizzas with one Fish option. 

We shared a warm Asparagus salad with duck shavings and mushrooms. All was drizzled with a pleasantly tart vinagrette.

I had the Schwartz pizza of smoked meat and cheeses. (See the Famous Schwartz Deli site). There was cheese in the perfectly baked crust. It was nice and thin under the toppings, but full enough around the edges that I could really enjoy the bread! 

My husband had the cod special - seared cod served on a bed of mushrooms and asparagus in a seafood stock. 

The staff were friendly and the service was very good - I could tell these people knew what they were doing.

A great little place!"}
{"text":"Love this place the owners are soo sweet, and the food is great!! 

Loved the smoked meat pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a VERY long time, partially because a friend recommended it to me, but also because I really like their logo, (I know it's plain, but seriously, it's reached a new level of wittiness, because it's like a logo pun.)

Anyhow tonight, I had the pleasure of checkin' out this place. 1st things 1st: Décor: Loved the paintings, loved the exposed brick walls, loved the openness of the place, and the drink menus on the wall. I noticed a pretty full looking bar, as well as a decent wine list. Cocktails were at $10 a piece, but I noticed how unique their drinks were (example: Gingerbread Man-tini, Clementini, Basil Caesar, Raspberry Mojito, Red Russian to name a few) The lighting for me was a little too dim, and it was nice and toasty inside. They have the no menus at the table concept, which would have worked out fine, except that I couldn't see the whole menu on the wall due to lighting. The vibe in the place was dates, friend gatherings, and let's meet for a drink. It was pretty loud too, and I can't tell you if there was even music competing with that.

Our server was very nice, and attentive, and my water glass never was empty. My firend got the Crabcakes, and Gnocchi with Chevre and I went for the Mac 'n' Cheeza. Pizza with Mac and Cheese, you can't really go wrong with that.  The pizza was humongoid, and the tomato was fresh, the cheese was tasty, and the combo worked.  We were told the most popular pizza was the Schwartza, a smoked meat pizza, as well as the Taco Piza. They even had a lazangza. (if you haven't picked up on the za endings on the different things...)

Aside from the pizza choices, they also have a halibut, steak, spaghetti options, and starters of Mom's Meatballs, Caesar Salad, House Jane Salad, Buffalo fries, and much more. 

As for our food, things were good, I tried some of the crabcake, and it wasn't my favourite by far, (waaay too spicy but good aioli), you couldn't miss the goat cheese with the gnocchi, but I was happy with the pizza choice. 

Overall, I'd come back for the ambience, and to try out the lazangza!"}
{"text":"Je ne peux pas y résister, je dois réécrire un avis pour Jane. Je suis allée hier soir pour une sortie avec mon amoureux et nous avons goûté à quelques nouveaux plats que nos amis avaient recommandés dont les boulettes de viande, les crab-cakes et la pizza Bianca. Et je donne un gros 5 étoiles parce que bien que ça soit des plats assez simples, ils étaient excellents. Je sais que ça n'était que d'ordinaires boulettes de viande à la sauce tomate, mais c'était sans aucun doute les meilleures de ma vie sans aucun doute. Et les crab-cakes....oh mon dieu! Est-ce que ça serait dangereux d'en manger à tous les jours? Finalement, la pizza Bianca avec de l'huile de truffe, des champignons et un peu de pesto frais fondait dans la bouche. J'ai même trouvé la Schwartza meilleure cette fois-ci que la dernière. On dirait qu'il y avait plus de viande et plus de cornichons. Une chance que les portions étaient aussi généreuses que la dernière fois! Comme ça, j'en ai profité une deuxième fois pour le lunch d'aujourd'hui. Et même comme restants, les pizzas étaient encore délicieuses."}
