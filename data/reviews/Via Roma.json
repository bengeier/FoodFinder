{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... I went there with my husband for our anniversary. The terrace is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, it's completely magical and it's what made me want to go there in the first place. I had the meat tortellini with rosée sauce, and my husband had some too. After dinner, he started feeling sick. The next morning, he was okay, but I started feeling terrible and found out I had a bacterial infection. It's been four days now and I'm still terribly sick, I'll most probably have to be hospitalized.  So yeah, avoid this place - or at least the tortellini. I just had a talk with the owner and it would seem it's not the first time something like that happens. She did seem really sorry and I hope she'll try to do something about this.  P.S.: I think the owner also works as waitress, a member here posted a photo of her. She was our waitress too. I must say she acts a little condescending and that pizza thing doesn't really surprise me. She really seems to take people for fools."}

{"text":"The reason we came to this restaurant was because of the place's lovely vines and lights and the big window, letting in lots of light. Charming during the day and even more romantic at night!  However, my boyfriend and I looked really out of place with our kinda carefree outfits (being teenagers doesn't help that much either...), and I think we didn't look like the average clientele they served.   The menu had many delicious choices, and the price was very reasonable. I remember the server serving my boyfriend's plate with mine, and vice-versa, but that was quite funny. I don't remember what I ordered, but I remember devouring my plate and not even finishing it because I was so full!   The ambiance was great. I loved watching people pass by and being amazed by the place. Quite a nice experience!"}
{"text":"I too was at Via Roma last night with the large party and was one of the ones sick. I have been sick all night and Day. And to just find out the manager could care less is very upsetting. I will be calling the heath department about this restaurant! I was a restaurant manager for years and would never treat a guest of my restaurant like this especially one that got sick at my restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Via Roma until tonight, when a friend gathered us together for a thank-you meal after a charity event. Because of the structure of the meal, I was fortunate enough to sample several of Chef Pasquale's dishes. The evening's fare was EXACTLY what I'm looking for when I'm craving Italian food: authentic, delicious, FRESH! The chef got everything right, down to the most minute detail, from the vinaigrette on the salads and buffalo mozzarella and tomato appetizer, to the bubbling cheese on the pizza (oh yum, now I'm craving it) to the perfectly cooked gnocchi. The tiramisu was perfect and the espresso (and I'm PICKY when it comes to coffee) aromatic and STRONG! I highly recommend Via Roma...and you'll probably be seeing me there shortly too!"}
{"text":"There are 2 questions one must ask (IMO) when choosing where to spend your money when dining out. 1. Do you want great service and to be treated like family? Even by the owner himself? 2. Do you like great food prepared with passion and the freshest most high quality ingredients available? Of course the answer is always yes for me. Augusto Conte has hand crafted a gem of an authentic Italian Restaurant in Waverly Walk, south Charlotte. All of the traditional Italian dishes are spot on and if you want to experience the pinnacle of flavor, there are only two things to remember from the menu: The Mare' seafood dish and the Filet Mignon. The filet with black truffle reduction is my favorite steak anywhere in Charlotte! The Mare' is a fresh seafood lovers dream done in a way only Augusto and his chefs can do it! If you sit at the bar you will find Ashley and Annisha to be the sweetest most attentive bartenders and servers anywhere. If you are fortunate enough to meet Augusto after 1 or 2 visits, he will never forget you and you will be treated by all just like family. The generosity of Augusto and his staff never ceases to amaze me. Treat yourself to Via Roma and you will find great friends, exceptional food, top notch service, and a wonderfully intimate and relaxing ambience. All the best to Augusto and his staff! Love ya Paul!"}
{"text":"This place was delish from the moment we walked in. Great atmosphere. Hostess was nice and we were seated immediately. We had an amazing appetizer antipasto and some delicious Italian wine. Our waiter was very patient as we caught up with old friends, even stating this is not a churn and burn restaurant. I had the carbonara. Amazing. All other entrees were delicious as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went here for Valentine's Day. This is a new upscale Italian place in Waverly. The service was excellent. The food was delicious. I had the chicken parmigiana and my husband had the carbonara. We started with the calamari and zucchini. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This may be the best Italian food option in South Charlotte. The Food was good (not exceptional) but good. The service on the other hand was superb. The price is a bit inflated for the meal but a good night out for a family or date night."}
{"text":"I stopped in the other day to meet a friend. Was greeted at the door and was seated at the bar. We received excellent service from Ashley at the bar. I will definitely return. 10/10."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food seemed to be excellent, service was fantastic but unfortunately after leaving everyone that ate a dish that included chicken became extremely sick to their stomachs. Out of 11 people, 7 had chicken and all 7 spent the entire evening into late morning in the bathroom. When I called to inform them last night the lady was very nice, apologetic and said the owner would be in touch ASAP. The owner never called so clearly he wasn't concerned about the chicken making people sick!  I will never return, will share this experience with anyone who asks for suggestions of Italian restaurants and am grateful that the 4 other people with us didn't order chicken alfredo or chicken parm like the rest of us. Shame on Augusto (manager or owner who never called me back) for his poor customer service in regards to this matter!!"}
{"text":"The service here is the worst, we had a group of 30 people in the empty restaurant and I asked to move some tables together and they said no that's impossible.  Then after waiting 45 min for our food I got the wrong pizza and went to give it back, the waitress then wanted to give me the half already eaten pizza which was sent to another customer to me.  She then started to argue that she saw nothing wrong with it, we all thought that was gross and crazy.... I cancelled my order because I did not want someone Else's half eaten pizza! ewww!  From those who did have the pizza said it was hard and had no taste!"}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid, avoid!!! Worst customer service you will ever receive... This mama and son duo just does not do it right, they both have the crappiest attitude and they both made a mistake on an order and instead of replacing the plate, with what was ordered they took back the plate, removed the shrimp from the pasta, placed them on a plate alone and served the fra diavola pasta  alone, and the cold shrimp alone, And charged fully for the meal,  which was not even touched!! when approached about it they started screaming that it was our fault, we did not order right! Excuse me? AVOID AT ALL COST!!! This place should be shut down... Give your money to someone that appreciates you as a customer! I used to go there regularly until I saw their true colors... Oh by the way see other peoples reviews, apparently people have been sick after eating at this place!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner last night and had a great meal! Started with the calamari which was one of the best calamari we have had. 2 of us that the Strozzapretti and we loved it. One had the veal shank which was fantastic and other had a salad and apps which were good as well. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Only drawback is the prices but food was very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was utter perfection. I came for lunch with my business partner. To start we were treated very nicely by the staff and brought to a table right away. We ordered bruschetta as an appetizer, excellent, very light and refreshing. I had the best gnocchi I have ever had in my life. Everything was prepared with the freshest ingredients possible. Over all this is my new favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte. There is no reason this restaurant should have any less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"1. Took awhile for our food to come out with barely anyone in the restaurant  2. Food was a little over salted and had to much oil in my pasta 3. Service was great!  4. Beautiful clean place! 5. Prices vary from 20.00 per meal & up.."}
{"text":"Italian food to me is unique in the sense that it's pretty easy to tell when it's done well and when it's not. This restaurant's customer service is beyond excellent. The waiters were there on their A game for every of our needs. They were nice and very open with what they thought were great choices. The restaurant is nestled in the heart of the Waverly community and the area was very active with people when I was there. The vibe of the area was energetic and very upbeat. However the food was mediocre at best. For what I was paying for it, it did nothing for me. I felt like I could have put the meal together myself and by no means do I possess any significant skill in the kitchen. Viva Roma you guys have most of it right. Your customer service is on point. You chose a great location and your staff and ambiance is great but your food lacks flavor and ingenuity. I would love to come back here, it's a great place but not for food I can put together my self for next to free."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with Ryan our waiter ! His suggestions were spot on! I will say the hostess was very rude not only to me but my future daughter in law and daughter. All I can say great waiter and food, but almost walked out because of person who greeted us."}
{"text":"Wow! Just Wow! I have been craving a good Italian meal for awhile now and while I have had pastas recently nothing ever really hit the spot. But this place was absolutely delicious and I can say that I have officially found my new favorite Italian place. It's so great to have this open up so close to home. Waverly is such a great spot. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and amazing food. This place is worth a try."}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment last evening with a large party. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. In terms of the food it was excellent, so I thought until I returned home and had gotten sick which lasted into this evening. Among our party, a half a dozen of us had the same or similar in terms of protein and each of us experienced sickness as a result. When speaking with the manager he did not take any ownership what so ever.  Pretty positive I won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"My instinct is to yearn for this place to survive and thrive, it's got so much going for it that every time I walk by I quote the song and: \"say a little prayer for you.\" It's just a little further north on St Laurent than the other Italian restaurants of the same size in Little Italy, and I think that means that the few tourists who come through our tiny Petite Italie generally don't make it. But that's a shame - the food quality is the same if not better, and the ambiance, especially on a summer eve, is lovely. The entire front section of the restaurant - storefront and ceiling - is windows that open to leave nothing between you and the starry sky but thick green vines and white fairy lights. J'adore.  If there was a more basic anti-pasto appetizer on the menu I'd eat here more often - you know, a mix of cured meats, cheeses, olives etc - because I could eat this every day, and because the menu is otherwise quite dominated by pizza and pasta.  The ambiance is so pretty it does seem a shame to have that giant TV in the middle of the space - personally I think Via Roma is so romantic and yet unpretentious and classy they would do better to remove the TV, or use it exhibit video art, and focus on drawing people in with events like wine tastings, pizza and pasta lessons, Italian folk music, but hey, maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Via Roma is a authentic Italian Restaurant. Its is owned by Italians, and actually Italians cook there. Its is a Family operated business. It's a great place for a date, so bring your special person to enjoy a great atmosphere, in a cosy/romantic wonderland.  The Pasta and Pizza, is a great touch to your evening."}
{"text":"Date Night-upscale Italian-sister if Toscana in the southpark area. Yes, the Waverly area is insane in Sat. night but since they take reservations you only have the massive busy parking lot to deal with.   Tablecloth place with delicious food and great service. Started out with special eggplant appetizer and crusty bread with bean/basil spread. Our table got Carbonra-Tortellini, and lasagna-all delish. Split desserts of daily changing special of coconut gelato, ricotta cheesecake and tiny  hand made cannoli.   Small bar area but make reservations-totally packed the whole time we were there. Upscale casual-no one in suits or anything."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian in charlotte hands down! Ashley makes some of the most amazing drinks!! Deliciouso"}
{"text":"First time at this place, the menu is encrypted with a Italian themed restaurant. The group that we went with all of that different sorts of pastas and they all tasted amazing. I got myself a chicken with some spaghetti and that was really good. Great place to hang out with friends and family."}
{"text":"Tried Via Roma for lunch. It was alright. Service was alright as well.. I think it says it all. Wasn't blowed away by the experience so I won't be going back."}
{"text":"J'aimerais dont bien pouvoir parler italien pour me sentir comme si j'étais en voyage quand je vais chez Via Roma. Heureusement, Érik M qui avait organisé un bon souper s'en est occupé pour nous et nous a aidé à choisir les meilleurs plats puis nous a montré comment dire quelques phrases simples en italien. J'ai donc mangé la salada capresse (tomate, mozzarella, huile d'olive, origan, sel et poivre) qui était extrêmement simple et autant goûteuse. Par la suite, on m'a recommandé la spécialité de la maison, les gnocchis à la roma. Oh miam! J'ai commencé à en manger en me disant que je pourrais garder la moitié pour le lunch du lendemain, mais après avoir dévoré le deux tiers de mon assiette, il ne m'en restait pas assez pour en remmener, donc j'ai mangé l'assiette au complet. Et bien que j'avais l'estomac plus que plein, vu qu'il y avait du tiramisu au menu pour le dessert, j'ai sacrifié mon confort pour en manger un bon morceau et je ne l'ai pas regretté. La place comme telle est très bien éclairée avec les grandes fenêtres, puis quand le soleil tombe et que les lumières de Noël qui parsèment les vignes du plafond s'allument, ça devient très romantique comme endroit."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Cute little Italian restaurant with great food and service. A little pricey but worth it.  We went for Easter brunch and Cross was a fantastic server.  Very attentive and answered all our questions.  Everyone in the family was pleased.  The special provided a nice appetizer variety with an entree and a sample of desserts.  Well done Via Roma!!  Made our Easter memorable!  And did I mention the mimosas and peach bellinis...A+++"}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner here in the pleasant terrace area. The space was charming, the service was friendly, and the food was delicious -- lasagna, gnocchi, and caprese all delivered. I highly recommend this place and will definitely return."}
