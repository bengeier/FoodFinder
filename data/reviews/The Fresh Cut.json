{"text":"Fresh Cut is the best restaurant in Madison. I have eaten sushi in California, Texas, and here and his is up there or better than any of them. I am not a sushi expert, but am a foodie that's eaten at some of the country's most famous restaurants and this place is a little gem. I hope it's in Madison for the long haul!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Everyone super friendly. You can't go wrong with the sushi there!  Love it!   Mexican was great too!   They also have the Corona margarita drinks."}
{"text":"This is literally the best restaurant food I've ever had...so delicious!! Portions are generous everything is fresh and made from scratch, seasoned perfectly. ..will be seeing Fesh Cut on Food Network!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal. The best salmon I've had.  We will definitely be back.  They recently dropped the sushi however."}
{"text":"Since I pass through Madison frequently, I decided to give this place a try since I heard it had great sushi.  Sadly, the sushi chef no longer works there, but, that meant I needed to try something from the incredible cooked food menu. Just reading the menu tells you this place is much more than it appears. Four pages in, I stopped on scallops, ordered, and was blown away when they arrived.   I'm going back at the next opportunity. P.S.  it's not exactly a formal dining ambiance. Go there for the food."}
{"text":"Went on a friend's recommendation and it was fabulous!!!  We had a tried a bunch of the sushi and it was fantastic!!  They had super white tuna, which is one of my favs, and it was superb!!!  I loved it.  Someone else had the Wellington and loved it.   I will definitely be back.  Great sushi place in Southern Indiana!! Who knew!!"}
{"text":"Interesting diverse menu, but not overdone.  Beer list is getting fuller over time.  Sushi is always fresh and artistic.  Great place to have a date night or a relaxed business dinner. The owner (Wade) is great to talk with and always has a story for you."}
{"text":"We drove an hour and a half out of our way to try this place because of the great reviews.  We pulled up to the door at 1:30 in the afternoon on Saturday and found the parking lot empty.  The hours on the door state 11 am to 9 pm Monday through Saturday but the door is locked.  We tried calling before we got here but just kept getting a generic answering machine. We were really looking forward to eating here.  Does anybody know if they are still in business?"}
{"text":"Great food reasonably priced , my wife had the scallops and pasta and I had the fish tacos, both where very good !! We purchased a groupon which even made things nicer , our waitress was very sweet and filled our drinks many times !!"}
{"text":"Looks like a scuzzy diner from the street... Don't be fooled. I was quite impressed! Excellent food, if it were closer to home I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Don't let the building scare you away.  The food is amazing and reasonably priced.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic lunch at The Fresh Cut. The Fresh Wrap was out of this world good and the homemade chips were fresh and crisp. The surrounding were very clean and staff were very friendly. Will DEFINATELY be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great find in Madison.  We loved the chicken picatta, the wine and beer list and the sweet patio with fans for outdoor dining. The service was friendly.  We will return to try more of the creative selections on the menu such as salmon or scllops or sushi."}
