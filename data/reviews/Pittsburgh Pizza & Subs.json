{"text":"Food wasn't good and arrived at the end of the 40-60 minute time frame. Chicken was greasy and salad had tomatoes (requested no tomatoes)on it and wasn't chopped up just big pieces of lettuce . I also found a small fly on it.  The fries were soggy and greasy (I understand it's hard to be fresh with take out but these were beyond bad) $28 for crappy food! I will never order again."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty tasty, but the wings are outstanding! Best in town. Sometimes the service is a little slow, which is why I selected 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I learned about this place 2 months ago and love it. Ordered for the 4th time tonight. Im moving in  month and will definitely miss this place. Good Pizza and good staff check em out."}
{"text":"This was my 2x time ordering delivery & wanted to make sure service was consistent. It is. Wings are full sized and awesome. We got the wing dust & they're good! Medium pizza is nice size with plenty of sauce & cheese all the way to the end of the crust-- YES!-and the kids went crazy for the Buffalo Cheese Bacon Ranch Fries. Pleasant staff including delivery guys- they are working hard to sell a good product. Try them out- especially the wings!"}
{"text":"Great food and happy they deliver to mount Vernon, becoming a favorite of ours. However giving 4 stars for now as for the few times we've ordered the order gets messed up somehow, and I was not happy that their website showed a daily deal that when I mentioned they wouldn't honor. But overall solid food."}
{"text":"Decided to come to this new pizza shop I heard about called Pittsburgh Pizza and Subs after my soccer game at Pittsburgh Indoor Sports Arena with some friends and it was such a good idea!   We all got this white pizza they call the \"Pittsburgher\" and I don't even like white pizza but this pie completely changed my opinion of them. Also had some breaded jumbo wings on the side that had some of the best seasoning I've had in a while.  Overall an excellent little pizza shop with a wide variety of specialty pizzas at a fair price and a wonderful staff.  Check it out! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"really good subs.  everything was ready for pick right when they said"}
