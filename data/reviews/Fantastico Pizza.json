{"text":"Nothing to write home about. I was really looking forward to this pizza since I haven't had one in years. Big disappointment. Crust was soggy and I'm not sure what that stuff was that they claimed was bacon. Too bad"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this pizza place and I'm glad we did! Good fresh toppings and the crust was absolutely excellent. Nice chew, crisp, and well seasoned with hints of good olive oil.   I had a walk in slice of vegetarian with roasted red peppers, spinach and really fresh bruschetta-like sauce. Quality product, I'll definitely be back here. It's also got a cute, homey decor and a surprisingly pretty bathroom. Beats a chain, hands down, any day. I recommend it if you're in the area. Ãˆ fantastico!  To the other reviewer complaining about the lack of wifi, since when is that a requirement for a local pizza place? Seems silly and petty."}
{"text":"Chucky cheese pizza place is garbage poor customer service greasy pizza undercooked dough wouldn't eat there again ever"}
{"text":"I needed to write this review not because the food is no good -- but because the service is THE WORST.  THE MOST AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. My boyfriend and I have placed a delivery order for Fantastico three times before, and on the fourth time, we were told they do not deliver in our area.  Of course we were confused -- then we were told, if we place a minimum of $35, they will deliver.  Our order was almost $50 the last few times so perhaps this was never mentioned -- however this time around, it really felt as if they DID NOT want to have to deliver.  As we were giving the credit card info for payment, we were interrupted by the owner/manager to clarify the address, and he was upset that my boyfriend had mistakenly said we were south or north of an intersection - from there it became such a big issue.  We had given the correct address -- but they were taking this order as if it was the biggest inconvenience of their lives.  It's as if they didn't want our service and when we questioned them, they said \"Do you want the pizza or not\".  All I can say is WOW.  I personally no longer wanted to order from them but my boyfriend is picky with food so he still placed the order.   The way I look at it is -- CUSTOMER SERVICE is just as important.  These guys did not care if we ordered the pizza or not.  In fact, the girl taking my order even said, well we're closing soon. :- |  And so I guess no one wanted to make the pizza??   Their pizza is not that good to put up with shitty service."}
{"text":"First time here, and this is going to be in my lunch rotation for sure. Pizza tasted good. Ordered a slice and pop that was $5 including tax. Crust definitely was not soggy as other reviewers said. Slice was average in size. Guys were really friendly and seemed helpful. Place also looks nice on the inside. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Oakville and have been trying to find some amazing pizza like we used to get from Vesuvio's in Toronto and all I can say about this place is meh.  It's pizza.  It has that going for it but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I'll always go for the non-chain shops, but I can't really recommend this one. They got the order wrong (askes for regular, got thin crust) and it took an hour. Both lapses would have been forgotten had the pie delivered...which it did not. Bland sauce, soggy crust and cheese/toppings were coming apart. Would choose the chains next time"}
{"text":"I don't know what fantastico means in english, but whatever it is, I bet it means delicious! Me and my two kids call this our favourite, without a doubt! They have a fire oven, just like they used to use before we had stoves, like the in the 90s! Me and my kids will keep coming back, as long as they keep their pizza delicious! (or should I say, fantastico!)"}
{"text":"One of the best in Oakville. The sauce has just a bit too much pureed onion or onion powder but otherwise it's pretty fantastic pizza."}
{"text":"I made it my mission to find a great pie in Oakville that didn't come from a chain restaurant, and my search stopped after trying Fantastico's.    As an aside, my search was motivated by an extreme hatred for Pizza Pizza.  As a Raptors fan, I was always infuriated that Raps fans at the ACC were more interested in cheering for their free slice of cardboard when the team scored 100 points than the home team winning the game.  Plus, I believe that people who like this product (I refuse to call it pizza) have taste like an onion.  Anyways, having said that, I believe that Fantastico's is the anti-Pizza Pizza, in that it is delicious.  The toppings are fresh, the crust is seasoned and flavorful, and the sauce is tasty as well.  Plus, it is cooked in a wood burning oven.  In fact, the whole kitchen is open concept as these guys have nothing to hide and everything happens right in front of your very eyes.  It is quite obvious this restaurant is proud of their pies.    The service here is also top notch.  The staff on the phone are very polite, and welcoming.  The staff in store also make you feel like a valued customer.  Very hospitable.  All around, a great experience.    Oakville as a town has strange taste, for the most part, and seems to love chain restaurants.  This makes it all the more rewarding to find an independent place with a product far superior to the chains.  Fantastico Pizza, I salute you!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Crust is the right balance of crispy and chewy. A great selection of toppings. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I was hoping for a good experience, a place to get great wood oven pizza... you will not find that here. The specifications: thin crust and well done, I even repeated before hanging up, please make sure it's well done. Got there and was excited because there were quite a few people, surly a good sign right?  That pizza was NOT well done, it was pretty much the furthest thing from well done! We had to fold it in half to eat it because the crust was so underdone.  Their sauce was ok, the saving grace was the toppings. The hot peppers were great. I did hot peppers and roasted red peppers on the who thing, green olives on half and pepperoni for the meat eater on the other half. The crust was chewy, and did not taste like a wood burning oven at all."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza place in Oakville. I haven't been able to find any other place that makes their pizza in a wood burning oven and BELIEVE ME, it makes a difference. They have a huge variety of toppings and no one can beat the price. The pizza is fresh and cooked to perfection. Yes it is a drive for most people but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Good slices from wood fired oven.  Service was so so,"}
{"text":"A delicious little pizza joint on Kerr St. I got a medium pepperoni pizza and it was delicious. I'd go there again without a doubt.  Can't really say much more as I got my pie to go. The inside looked clean. There were 5-6 tables and a tv tuned to the baseball game. All in all, exactly what I expect from a pizza joint!"}
{"text":"First, there is no free wifi.  2nd its not a stone oven, its a gas flame.  The hunt for a great pizza is still on. It shouldn't be that difficult.  Oh and its not really a restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a wood oven pizza when I stumbled upon the reviews for this place on Yelp so I decided what the hell.  All you need to know is that the pizza and service are great, you get good value for money, and while you wait for your pie, you can play a short round of 80's Trivial Pursuit to pass the time.  I think I found my new Oakville pizza spot!"}
{"text":"A really good pizza place. I'd rather spend my money here than the big chains like pizza pizza. I never eat the crust of pizza and this place I did. They cook their pizza in a stone oven which gives it a flavour and texture a normal oven just cannot. Great toppings and definitely more fresh and real than other pizza chains. Only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star was that I'm comparing this to my all time favourite pizzas and I've been there multiple times and 1 time the customer service wasn't that great, not rude or anything but just not the best. But definitely recommended and will go back!"}
