{"text":"This place was awesome! The staff was friendly and nice. The food was delicious. I got the lamb shank and there was plenty of food. Great hummus and rice too. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"The chicken shwarma was good. But both times my girlfriend ordered, they came back saying \"oh we don't have that\" even when I asked for tea. And the other employees set in the next room being very loud and obnoxious in their native tongue. It took almost an hour for two all orders because they stood around talking"}
{"text":"Cheap prices, great quality, deluces food. I am a Saudi and they do the rice dish perfect in similer manner to the Saudi style!
Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"You have to try the Somali Tea (ask for no cream if you are Vegan).

Love JUBA.  The Sambusa appetizers are my favorite. The amount of food you get is AMAZING for the price.  It is clean , very good service, and love the middle eastern/ east african vibe and atmosphere.  You can sit on the floor , or at tables/booths.

It is a small restaurant...nothing fancy.  They have goat, lamb, chicken, fish, etc.

I am a Hebrew, so I am very picky about pork products.  NO WORRIES here.  Everything is separated and freshly cooked to order.

Now, if you are looking for a restaurant with more Ethiopian foods and dishes, this is not the place.  It is more Middle Eastern and Somali."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had come here once and he mentioned it was a must try. I'm a very spectacle person so walking into a dark restaurant with no one here I was concerned then siting on the floor (Which is an option) I was nervous to try something new BUT let me tell you, IT WAS BOMB!!!! The Food was authentic with lots of flavor not to mention the plates were huge. The quietness made it relaxing and enjoyable. Happy Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"I love this food here, service-not so much.

As someone with genetically determined diet, it's difficult to enjoy eating out anymore. This place is great because I can go here with my family and we can eat according to our different diets. 

They offer floor-seating. This is a perfect option for large parties. There are two menus, one Greek/Mediterranean and the other Ethiopian. 

Service is sparse. I've only seen two servers for the whole restaurant each time. They also cashier. This makes for very occupied servers.

This is a bummer, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time trying Somalian food at Juba. New management they say but the yummy food, that was left in the kitchen as they ran out of most items on their menu, seemed microwaved instead of being fresh. Not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! I love the food and atmosphere! Friendly staff...and great ethnic food!"}
{"text":"I've never had falafel before but now I never want to have it from anywhere else, the service was great and they accommodated a really big party for us, too. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"I liked the ambience. Quite different from the usual restaurants around tempe. Food tasted good. The service was little slow.  The juice contained more ice and water and less juice. But yeah the food compensated for the horrible juice."}
{"text":"Authentic food great price. Lovely staff. Room of Floor seating and a room for booth seating. Get the green jalape√±o sauce they have and put it on everything ok"}
{"text":"The food is great. the service is a bit slow, but the server was very nice. the reason why I give it 2 stars is because they didn't honor our Entertainment book coupon. the only reason why we even found out about this place was the book, so they got what they wanted out of having a coupon in the book while we didn't. it's a shame because while we were eating I was really happy thinking we had found a new place to dine at. after not having had the coupon honored though, I certainly don't want to go back there. I think it was dishonest of them. they may not have given one of our dishes for free, but they just lost many more dishes they would get in the future from two Tempe residents who eat out every Friday."}
{"text":"This place is a new hookah lounge I found recently and has become my favorite local spot to smoke. They offer great hookah prices that I haven't seen anywhere else and the staff is very friendly! I recommend everyone to check it out, you might see me there!"}
{"text":"Oh boy this spot.... so good!!
First of all, nicest staff ever.

Place has an area with chairs & tables and another next to it with cushions and a small floor level tables.

Not lets get to the mouth watering part. The FOOD.

Dishes are super affordable and rich in flavor. 
My favorite dishes here are the humus and chicken shawarma....please don't forget to order plenty of the green sauce, I am seriously addicted to it.

Service time is average.

Must give it a try! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and decided to give Juba a try. Very happy with my overall experience and I can't wait to go again! I recommend Juba to everyone that wants to try different food with a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is the slowest, and most horrifically unreliable businesses in Tempe. We came in here often in the beginning because their green sauce is amazing, but taking 10 minutes for a water, and terrible consistency in the food is shameful. Way overpriced, and the service is deplorable. We tried it many times at the inception of the business, but lost patience for all of the ridiculous things I mention above."}
{"text":"Small but well maintained. Food is authentic and excellent. 
Try the chicken shawarma with the green sauce. Wow. 
The chicken shish with chapati is good too if you are fan of thinner breads and more chicken filling"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bottle drink because i was thirsty. The place looks very clean and smells good.  The lady was super nice that helped me.  I will be back for food next time I'm hungry."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was pretty good - cheap too. It started as an Ethiopian restaurant but the server told me that some Somalis bought it. The atmosphere was fine and they have a sitting room - see photo. The service was fine and the bathrooms were clean. My date enjoyed her Vegan meal and I enjoyed my beef dish. We left thoroughly satisfied - the portions were adequate. I would come here again. Celebrate Diversity! Solid!"}
{"text":"Worst food I have ever tasted in my life. I went with my husband yesterday around 8.45pm. We ordered Ethiopian food. Sumbusa for appetiser and shared a vegetarian combination platter. The Sambusa was tasting ok. The five Vegetarian dishes we ordered were bland and was tasting similar (Shiro, Cabbage+carrot dish, green lentils, mushroom, red lentils). Injera was sour and sticky.

Please don't go here for Ethiopian food.

Place not to visit when you had a bad day or when you have craving for an Ethiopian food.

Except the service nothing was good. The one star is for the service."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times because some of my family seems to enjoy it since it is one of the few halal joints in town that isn't mediterranean. I have had a bad experience every time but never bothered to leave a review. Today pushed me over the edge. Service has always been terrible and today it was exceptionally bad. Had to beg for silverware, wrong drinks bought out, server not listening to orders and repeating something 10 times until they understand. But what was the worst today was I ordered 2 kofta kabob plates for my kids. Came out and I let them start eating until I looked over and saw the inside was literally completely raw. Charred on the outside and raw on the inside. I was furious, and the server shared no care. Just took it to the back and it took another 30 minutes to being my kids any food! Not sure how this place gets high reviews, probably people used to bad service and inconsistent food. Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Large amount of food and it's really delicious!!
I order the grilled chicken rice.
The chicken is great and the rice taste really special!!
It worths a try."}
{"text":"Blue Nile's Ethiopian menu is still served plus an addition of another menu. Great food! Average hummus though... I would pass on that, but everything else is great."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. It's relatively cheap but the food is quality, the servers are extremely friendly and helpful, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance to it. You can sit at what I assume to be African style dining tables, on the floor, or at a table if you prefer.

This place is great if you're vegan or vegetarian--especially when going out to eat with people who aren't, because there's plenty options for both.

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas, baba ghannouj (my personal favorite) and then getting one of the vegetable (or meat) dishes with 5 different 'platters,' which are sort of like tapas or dim sum but with flavorful African/middle eastern flavors."}
{"text":"This is not authentic Ethiopian restaurant, the menu is kind of mixed Mediterranean (Somali/Nigerian) .. I was deceived by this restaurant. Don't go if you are looking for pure Ethiopian."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan.  Everyone who I take to this place loves it.  Great food with great service.  The guy even threw a couple things in free while we waited.  I like how the one room you can sit on floor cushions as well."}
{"text":"They took on the menu from Blue Nile, which I was excited about. But frankly, the Ethiopian food quality went way down hill fast. Many items are often missing from that menu, and I went in on day in the evening and they \"hadn't cooked that yet.\" 

The middle eastern food there is decent but not very vegetarian friendly. If you're going there for that, you'll get what you expect. If you're going for the Ethiopian food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing hummus, falafel and basbaas cagaar (green hot sauce) and VERY vegan-friendly. 

As a note, if you're rude, leave your attitude at the door. The staff are exceptionally warm, friendly and accomodating, and the food is cooked with love. It's a blessing to Tempe to have such sweet people bringing real Somali food to you at such a good price. Appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Favorite spot in the city of Tempe. Love the setting and service. The chicken shawarma is my favorite. I've been coming to this location for the past 9 years."}
{"text":"Kind of loved this place, but I felt a little weird being only one of two females (dining with my husband and female friend) in the whole place.  Could be a cultural thing. 

Super friendly wait staff.  Nice mix of Lebanese, Ethiopian and other middle east cuisines.  You can sit at tables, or around another section at traditional mesabs (sp?) or on the floor without shoes.  If I would have know this I would have worn better socks.  Of course the husband wanted to eat on the floor.  Food was good, I've had better Ethiopian.  Relatively cheap compared to other restaurant of similar quality.  I would go back, with new socks :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Large servings. The people here were so nice and welcoming. There is an option to sit traditionally on the carpet floors In one room, and table seating in another. We had a large party of 15 people & the staff was so accommodating. Highly recommend for some good Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Delicious food please try you would like it 
Excellent service very clean style you eat your food on the floor which is I really like it Mediterranean style chicken. I like it if you're looking for something you"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Ethiopian food, I'm surprised how good it was. We started with hummus and had chicken shawarma and hill in goat which were really good. The rice was very good. Im surprised how slow the place was for being a Friday night"}
{"text":"went there once the Wait was ridiculous and when u get ur food its sometimes wrong still good just wrong, will try 1 more time

went back awesome! going back"}
{"text":"Its unfair that yelp doesn't let you give 0 stars. Yes, this is a business and they do put in work. But here is the kicker , you are not running this restaurant in somalia or some 3rd rate neighborhood, it is here in the USA. So your customer service AND food needs to be of some minimum threshold.
 Never in my 9 yrs of stay have I been yelled yet by a restaurant receptionist (they have been rude, yes and indifferent , yes, but never ever yelled at). The tall guy at the reception, was extremely rude to start off. When I questioned the difference is the price posted on the wall and on my receipt, I was yelled yet, and a long sue of arguments ensued between me, that guy and his boss. The whole thing was so unprofessional, and I was treated like crap. It felt extremely racist. The food is barely good, definitely not goods enough to withstand this crap hole."}
{"text":"I just love the food here. It does not disappoint every single time. Must try the chicken shawarma and the grilled fish."}
{"text":"Love the shawarma....both chicken and lamb.......also the dining style with floored mats and sofa.....Arabian styleeee....didn't like mango shake though..."}
{"text":"We got a goat dish and a chicken dish.  Fast, hot, and flavorful.  Very ethnic restaurant -- l love it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Great experiences eating there and you can call in an order and pick it up. Large portions and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"It's been ages since I had Ethiopian cuisine. The last time I ate here was when it was still named Blue Nile. It looks like they kept the Blue Nile menu, but then expanded it to include more general Middle Eastern dishes.

We stepped in for lunch, and saw the large advertised sign on the window for $5.99 lunch. There are 2 large menus to choose from. Browsing through the menu, we couldn't find the lunch specials on it anywhere. When I asked the waiter where I could find the lunch specials on the menu though, he vaguely pointed to the 3 pictures on the window in front, and briefly described them. Maybe it's just me, but it's odd to not have at least a printed paper description of your lunch specials at your table if they are so boldly displayed on your window front. Since there were only 3 of them, it would not be that hard to describe or print out!

Anyways, we decided to share the veggie/meat Ethiopian combo ($9.50). My friend asked \"Is it good?\" and the waiter replied almost instantaneously \"It's alright.\" Not very reassuring, no? So we asked what would be better. After some hesitation, he pointed to quite possibly the most benign, Americanized, and uninspiring menu item, the grilled chicken salad. He then went on to say that the combos were quite popular (...But not good?). Faced with this rather odd discourse, we decided to carry on with our plan to get an Ethiopian dish and take the risk!

The combo came out in fairly quickly. The dish came with grilled beef, chicken, and 3 veggies of your choosing. Unfortunately, despite having the waiter repeating our choices for us and pointing to them on our menu, one of the items was not the right veggie. Despite this mix up, the combo tasted good, and the injera bread went well with the meat and vegetables. 

Even though the sign out front says they were open from 11 to 10 that day, they decided to close at 1 P.M. and left the \"Open\" neon sign lit. Quite a few people tried to enter the restaurant only to find out that it was locked. We got there a little after 12 and were still eating when they locked up the door. They let us know that we could take our time and the chef could let us out when we were done, but we felt uneasy being the only customers in there, trapped inside so we left as soon as we finished. I'm not sure if they normally close at 1 P.M., but perhaps changing their signage or leaving a sign describing why you are closed just that day would help clear any confusion.

I used to really like going to Blue Nile for both the food and the service years ago, but since the change in management and name this rather odd eating experience has left me leery to frequent this restaurant again. On to Lalibela perhaps for our next Ethiopian outing!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. 

My favorite restaurant ever. I used to visit this place at least thrice a week when I was going to ASU back in 2012/14. It's been 3 years since I graduated and visited Tempe for a weekend. Drive straight from the airport to this place for the dinner even before checking into my hotel. 

This is not the best place for ambience, but if you're just looking for yummy Mediterranean food, then look no more. Chicken shawarma at Juba is just awesome. I'm so used to visiting the place that, back in 2013/14 the waiter would already know what I want as soon as I enter this place. I would say, I'm a die hard fan. 

The menu has changed a bit in the last 3 years, but the good stuff still remains. They can use a few more dessert options. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Mediterranean food in and around Tempe."}
{"text":"Here's the plan. You have a friend who likes adventurous, flavorful food but who just can't quite manage to like \"mediterranean\" food. You will take the friend to Juba. You will order for that friend the Chicken Shawarma meal. You will see your friend like Mediterranean food.

Or we could drop the pseudonyms and you could buy me some chicken shawarma. The spicing is somehow different from what I've had at Greek restaurants, and I like it better. On some future visit, I may try the goat, though I've had goat before elsewhere, so I don't get Adventurous Points for eating goat any more.

Entrees run about $11-$12, so for a dive ethnic restaurant, this isn't cheap-cheap, but the portions are gluttonously huge. The chicken shawarma is at least the poultry bulk of a healthy Cornish game hen, served on what I would consider to be a week's supply of very nice rice. There is also a frill of salad and a puddle of respectable hummus, with pleasant pita.

Service is sweet-natured and pleasant, and if you're bored during the short wait, you can read the free Pakistan West newspaper and decide that you really need to go to Pakistan to ride the Karachi Circular Railway when it's rebuilt."}
{"text":"Juba is an authentic Somali restaurant right in the heart of downtown Tempe. The owner is great and the food is delicious. The rice is crazy good."}
{"text":"Very tasty, very filling, yet once I found that one piece of chicken was raw on the inside, but this happened only once, so it isn't something to worry about."}
{"text":"Dirty bathrooms. Slow service. Took ten minutes to just get water. Here about an hour and twenty minutes total. 

The food is good, but I don't think it all warrants the high four stars this place had. The owner is nice and polite, but the service is just slow to deliver and non-attentive. 

The hooks area is a pretty cool spot. Wouldn't mind trying that area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place recently because she had very fond memories of the Ethiopian food at Blue Nile. Unfortunately, nothing on the two menus that were handed to us reminded her of the food that she previously had at Blue Nile, so we decided to ask for suggestions. Our waiter suggested the Hillib Goat and Chicken Musahab, so we decided to go with those and a hot Somali tea. Below I've broken down my comments on each of the items that came with the dishes and some extra info:

Hillib Goat and Chicken Musahab: Horribly bland and not hot enough (temperature wise). I've paired these two together because my feelings towards them are pretty much the same. 

Salad: It was aight (though I'm not really a fan of salad so...)

Rice: Decent. Large in quantity.

Pita Bread: Solid pita bread and fresh.

Humus: Holy schnikes. That was some good humus. If I could go back in time and just order some humus, I would be much more satisfied and would probably be writing a 5 star review right now.

Somali Hot Tea: Pretty good. Sweet, if you like sweet teas.

Time of Visit:  about 7:30pm

Price: 30+ for the two entrees and tea, including the tip. Considering the quality of the food, this was way too expensive. 

Service: It was ok. Nothing phenomenal, but it wasn't bad either.

Overall, we were pretty disappointed. The food quality just wasn't very good, especially considering the price (with the exception of the hummus)."}
{"text":"This place has opened up exactly where Blue Nile was closed down. The menu is almost exactly the same (with some Americanized add-ons), so you could just as well say  they changed the name. Same furniture and decor even, though they are showing a lot of wear. Love the the tables with the beans and lentils inlaid. The service is always better than at Lalibela - this is almost like a hidden gem after 4 years, though the strip mall lot continues to look seedy. 

I always share the vegan combo with the hubby, and the Wats kick ass - they have tonnes of vegan options. The sambussas and lentil soups are good too.  Finish off with the orange flavored vegan coffee cake, ALWAYS! How do they make that vegan cream??? Never tried the east of the red sea stuff - there are plenty of places where you can eat hummus and falafal, so why have the usual here? My only gripe is that Blue Nile rarely had the goat cheese on plantain available, and now Juba says they don't make those anymore. That really was some gourmet appetizer!"}
{"text":"Not the best Ethiopian I had. The food was actually less spicy and does not have that flavor I am used to. Dora wat and misir wat is good. Oh and they had shrimp....first time I seen that as an option...."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I went with two other friends and we all loved it. We sat at the floor lounging area and that really added to the awesomeness. Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"People here doesn't seem to write yelp review as often. I almost miss this gem because of the few reviews.

it is a very unique place, with seating choice of on the table, or on the floor, of course we chose the floor. it is just so relaxing sitting on the floor eating :) 

Food here tastes great too, the lamb meat was falling off the bone, and melts in your mouth. salad was refreshing. 

only complain is that the serving for this place is HUGE, the two of us would definitely gotten full if we only ordered one dish."}
{"text":"A spot rice down the street from Arizona state university. A little shack tucked in the corner but man is this place a gem. It was delicious. I had the lamb shank and it was sooo gooodd. I mean that's an understatement. The rice was good the lamb was hot and fresh. The side salad was on point. The service was fast and welcoming. The place was clean. Definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty. I've eaten Chicken Shwarma and Chicken Cotolette twice here. The Cotolette is amazing with delicious spicy rice alongwith fried chicken. The ambience is ok. A bit expensive if you are a voracious eater but if you aren't too hungry, you can easily share and be full in half price. They have lunch special dishes which are subset of the menu with half pricing in specific time of the day. A must visit if you are looking for shwarma."}
