{"text":"If you like gyros, check this place out. I recommend the giant gyro and pita chips with some extra sauce for dipping.  I tried the gyro melt once, but  prefer a much sharper  Swiss cheese so it really wasn't my bag. The service is always fast and friendly at a very good price point."}
{"text":"Yum!! Best gyro in Lorain! Shout out to Ali, great host of Nate's Marathon, home of the giant gyro!! YES, at a Marathon gas station.... he's got a very nice variety of gyros! Along with awesome sides, like red skinned potato salad, coleslaw & the pita chips with special dipping sauce is soo good! Then, to top off everything, you get a free Lorain journal or Elyria Chronicle with $10 purchase of fuel.   #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"Honestly I was hesitant because they are located in a Gas Station but I can tell you from what I seen its is very clean! They have a whole area just for the gyros. I got a gyro and OMG it was delicious! I wish this was closer to me because I would be there everyday ! My husband got the corn beef Reuben and also liked it. All around I was very happy!"}
