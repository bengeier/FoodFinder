{"text":"Creepy fun and Ãœber cheeky!...Just try your hardest not to think about the movie Deliverance.  Me and the gf stumbled onto this \"resort\" after visiting Bonnie Springs Ranch and it's super cool. It's the closest thing I've experience to being in a ghost town. Them donkeys can be pretty intimidating when they roam and approach you.  The restaurant by the pond looked interesting, the pond though, is a different story. Unfortunately, across the pond is a zoo. Avoid it, it's depressing. The ghost town is where it's at. Watch where you're going. The wood planks feel like they're about to break when you walk over them. The school and the Opera house are allegedly haunted. I didn't see anything except blazing heat and beautiful clear sky. I'm not sure how authentic the ghost town is but it it sure was authentically fun. I was hoping Slim Pickens would jump out at you anytime."}
{"text":"I love this place, a great place to just hang. Food was fair, but our server was great, quick and always there when we wanted something (not that overbearing type.) I had the BBQ chicken, must have been half a bird, took it home for my next lunch. We went for supper following doing the drive and hike at Red Rock Canyon. Perfect eveing!"}
{"text":"The cute little western town and shoot out was entertaining. The shabby mini zoo was sort of sad. The animals looked so unhappy. The food was just OK and expensive for the poor quality. Our server was not very attentive. Most of all there were FLYS. A lot of them getting on our food really BUGGED us. I guess with all the animal poop and birds so close not to mention horses you have to expect bugs. It was OK. Not great but OK. ."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take kids and out of town guests for a great hokey \"old west\" experience. We have bee going here since our son was 4 and he is now in college! For a $10 entrance fee, you can walk around the town, shop, got to the quirky zoo and watch an old west show where they involve the kids. Even includes a vaudeville stage show(which is so bad its good) and a \"Hanging\". Very quirky. Love the fact so many animals roam freely in the zoo, kids can pet and feed them, and don't be surprised if a goat or two starts eating your shirt! You can get drinks and alcohol at the saloon and they do have a restaurant, although we have had only snacks there. There is also a little train ride from one of the outer parking lots to the entrance which the kids love. A great day with the right attitude!"}
{"text":"My husband and myself took our son here a few months ago. He had a great time and we ate at the restaurant there it was very good and great service."}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers,  the bison burger is amazing,  staff are friendly and helpful bartenders are hysterical and western town is a lot of fun for children and adults"}
{"text":"The food looks good,  but don't bother waiting to be seated. Seems the way to go is to push your way past the hostess station and just grab a seat. After two full parties behind us helped themselves to tables and the rude, overwhelmed waitresses served them despite knowing we were waiting, we finally just left. Womp womp."}
{"text":"Fun for the family.  Take out of town guests here for a change.  Be careful the donkeys can be aggressive.  Beautiful drive and scenery.  Great burgers!"}
{"text":"The best bison burger I have ever eaten. It was free to come in and eat at the restaurant and view the petting zoo at Bonnie Springs and I am so glad that we came here. My dad got the salmon, and he loved it, saying it was some of the best he had ever had. The service was terrific and our waitress was very nice. The prices were super good for tourist eating and it was easily the best-for-the-price meal we enjoyed in all of the Grand Canyon and Vegas area. The eating area was so roomy with wooden tables and chairs and a fireplace. The bathrooms were decorated with floral wallboards and old costumes. A must-eat place.  The zoo part was also pretty cool. There were peacocks freely roaming around the yards, as well as chickens. They had some horses and a buffalo inside fences and the animals seemed well taken care of. Definitely an impressive spot to go check out."}
{"text":"If you want to be harassed by unfriendly staff, this is the place to be! Not only do they want you to spend $70 bucks for breakfast and drinks for two, but they harass you and threaten to kick you out if you bring any outside snacks for your kids! And don't worry, the staff will be there to watch you every minute until you put snacks away. And if you need help they are more than happy to waste public funds to call law enforcement."}
{"text":"Just showing up and finding designated parking was a treat. After riding the loop we were excited to finally get to our destination which was highly recommended by others.  This place is nestled in the red rock canyon"}
{"text":"I am only going to review part of this place.  Because I haven't got to explore the whole place.  The restaurant and bar at Bonnie Springs is a great hidden gem.  I lived in Vegas for 7 years and I never knew this place existed, and now I am mad at myself.  The bar has really great prices on the beers and plus they serve sarsaparilla for anyone who doesn't want an adult beverage.  The food is tasteful and good portions. Another thing about this place is that they do a ghost adventure at night.  We got to participate in this wonderful experience.  And it was very informative.  Its a definite must do."}
{"text":"We went to today in afternoon.  We parked in lot that allowed us to take the train to the \"town\" .  It is small and run down.  They were doing some remolding.  We enjoyed watching a hanging and talking to some of actors.    Afterwards i had a blast in the petting zoo.  it a few animals.  bring a couple quarters to buy some freed to freed the goats and ducks.   We didn't and had to go to the bar to get some.   And we finish our afternoon in the restaurant.  The menu had a lot of choices prices were reasonable.  I had a bbq burger.  The burger was great.  Juicy meat.  And it came with a side of onion rings.  Onion rings were bater in beer.  My bf had the pull pork.  The sandwich was a nice size but needed a kick. Lunch was 26 with tax and tip   i found a couple coupons and save $5 off admission (which 7 pp and it includes train, town visit and pettting zoo)   I do want to come back for bonnie screams."}
{"text":"At one time this may have been a more than a run down tourist trap.  Last weekend seven of us visited the restaurant and had to ask that four of the plates be replaced because they were splattered with food or coffee. This made us suspect, so we only ordered bottled drinks and fries"}
{"text":"love this rustic redtraunt..great food..great atmosphere..great drinks. Amazing dinner bread n ranch dressing...yumm..been here more then 30 times..the stesk dinner for 2 is a great deal and filling!"}
{"text":"There is an old town, a zoo and a turtle pond in addition to the restaurant.  Being the only place to go in miles, Bonnie Springs provides plenty of entertainment for visitors to red rock area.    After a hike we were starving.  The bison burger was great with big fat fries.  The log cabin serves rugged food with wild wild west salon themed restrooms.  After lunch we found peacocks roaming about and one showing off his pretty tail.   This is not the type of place I would seek out, but it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Maybe it isn't fair to review a place based on a seasonal experience only, but I can't find the option to review Bonnie Screams (the Halloween event at Bonnie Springs Ranch) separately on Yelp, so here goes... I'd never been to Bonnie Springs before and thought it would be fun to visit at Halloween and experience Bonnie Screams. I'd been to a similar haunted ghost town at Old Tucson (Arizona) last year, and hoped this would be as good. Unfortunately, it is not. The actors were trying, but the props and scenes they are given are poor, at best. One haunted house, The Asylum, consisted mostly of white sheets with red paint spattered on them set up in a maze-like fashion for us to walk through and about 3 young ladies dressed in sort of girl-nurse costumes with red splatters screaming at us as we walked through.  Another was set up as \"Circus of Chaos\" and was similar, but with black plastic landscape fabric and a few guys with clown masks, one with a chain saw (which actually smelled like it was burning petroleum - cough!).  Even the magic show was pretty lame. He was trying, but the props looked like he'd built them 15 years ago in his garage.  It's all OK, but for $25, I would have expected better. Oh, and the line to buy tickets was ridiculous. Not even moving. Buy them online. We were going to save ourselves a little bit of money by using a coupon we found, but it wasn't worth the wait and we ended up buying the tickets on one of our phones so we could bypass the line. Now I sort of wish I'd bypassed the entire thing. Sorry, Bonnie Springs. I know you are trying, but for all the people we saw in that place last night (and we're still 2 weeks out from Halloween, so I have no doubt it will get even busier as time rolls towards the actual holiday), you must be pulling in some bucks. Invest it in the experience next time!"}
{"text":"Zoo is the best part  along with the lake full of turtles and ducks,  not to mention the beautiful peacocks.  The only thing that is confusing is a big sign that says : help with donation .  is that aside from the $10 per adult and $7 p/ children ? Considering that it will  be more expensive than going to an actual zoo . Any how .....  The restaurant  is old western look that matches the place but the food is just  a piece of c@$#!p  We order  2 bowls of chilli  Chiken  club sandwich  Chiken sandwich &salad   2 Bbq pulled\" pork\" sandwiches with Cole slaw and fries .  My father in law got really upset stomach with chilli same as my husband.  The salad was full of baby corn and tomatoes and no lettuce at all .   the  Bbq pulled \"pork\"  sandwiches tasted more like road kill maybe road kill peacock.  Food was just awful  I just had one bite , I couldn't  take it! My husband had only few bites since he was hungry .  The whole bill was about $80 plus tip $15  Wasn't worth at all , we had to ask for several things to the waitress . She wasn't serving us properly . The only reason my father in law left tip was because of gratitude based on what we spend . I respect waitress service but seriously  some people don't deserve it .  We decide to give this restaurant a chance regardless of all bad reviews on food but now I know why they have such bad reviews. We will never come back to this place. They should make an effort to make their food better and hire better staff since it's the only restaurant near by. I would think that they could get more business .  Or maybe not ... maybe that's why they have c#$! Food because they know that people that get hungry have no choice but to eat there ."}
{"text":"Before we toured the Red Rocks we satisfied or hungers with bison burgers fries and cilantro coleslaw for lunch. Cherry pie did not seem to have any homemade attributes. We left wondering if we should've ordered the bread pudding on the menu.There was more than a little bit a ' 'moo' to the medium wells one burger. Our enthusiastic waiter can't be faulted for the very standard fare offered by this restaurant.        The big perk a here is the ambience. Men must retire at some point during the meal to check out the best urinal in all of the Las Vegas area. Diners seated near the windows were intrigued as to what passerby's were interested in just below their window upon exiting to inquire they discovered a small mouse unafraid sniffing about while perched on top of a pest control box. Obviously the nearby feed station for the ducks in the pond was a constant attraction to the vermin."}
{"text":"Reviewing for the Halloween event, bonnie screams. A little pricey at $25 dollars. It's not really scary at all. You'd think with all the money they're pulling in, it'd be a lot better."}
{"text":"We've gone out to Bonnie Springs many times over the years, saddened to watch it go downhill. But we've loved the Bison Burgers and their French fries have been worth the drive alone! In fact, my daughter and I took an afternoon trip just for fries and ice tea a few months ago - they were that amazing!  Today we stopped after a trip to nearby Spring Mountain Ranch, bragging to friends that the fries were well worth  our LONG wait in the cramped space between bar/restaurant. We'd had a picnic earlier but just had to stop for the fries. Imagine our disappointment when our two fry baskets (4.99 ea) arrived with completely different and very mediocre fries. We kept asking different wait staff when they changed them out and got 4 different answers, including that they'd 'always been the same'. Even after my daughter showed them a picture of the fries she'd taken on our last trip which were obviously not the same! I don't think we even ate a third of them.   Disappointed, my daughter consoled her friend, saying they could still walk around, feed the ducks and look at the animals. Wrong. The animals were gone, the grounds trash littered and very unkept. Perhaps they'd been moved to their 'not-for-profit' petting zoo which depended on 'donations and volunteers' but was now inside the main fee area. None of the kids felt it was worth the price of a wristband...  It has never been a slick attraction- quaint and rustic a more apt description- but the concept was, and still could be, viable, especially as one of a very few family friendly places to spend a day outdoors."}
{"text":"Went There  to enjoy a hot chocolate at the end of the day ... Nobody was at the entrance to seat us so we seated by ourself ... Waiting for 15 mins, the waitress wasn't coming because was mad we seated ???? ... Was very rude and impolite from the start to the end, throwing the bill on the table And looking at us in a mean way !!! Very disappointed, this place is fun and I'm sure this ranch was made with big heart but if they want to keep it alive they should treat the customers better !!!"}
{"text":"So My family and I  Came out here to eat at the Restaurant and we didn't do much walking around so I cannot Comment on the Ranch itself, But The Restaurant HOWEVER , The lighting in there is so horrible we had to ask to move to be able to see our dinner, and than a party of 3 ppl came in and sat at the table we left at and had to use there cell phones as lights to see the menu, The food is okay , I got the buckin burger , my mom got the fish and chips, and my wife got the famous Bonnie springs burger and they all tasted un- seasoned and bland , I don't expect a 5 star meal from a place like this but at least put some salt on the food, Our server was awesome that was the only good side of this , My overall complaint is the lighting in the restaurant, I could barley see anything, They really need to fix that because no one wants to eat in the dark, Its almost like they don't want you to see the food they give you ."}
{"text":"This place gets one star because the food is ... well... barely definable as food, and the service is horrendous. Perhaps it was ok once, but it is not worth a stop much as well putting down any money as of January 2015. Avoid it like Ebola."}
{"text":"My husband and i stayed here on our honeymoon.  The room was decorated in a western theme simply amazing, the room was very clean, towels were as white as could be. We were also given a bottle if champagne to celebrate. We were able to get to see the wild west show for free just showed them our room key. The restaurant has amazing food and very friendly staff love the potato skins!!!! We went to sleep to the sound of coyotes, and woke to the sounds of roosters. I would recommend anyone to stay here very friendly staff.  Can't wait to stay again.  Thank you all Bonnie Springs staff for your hospitality."}
{"text":"Fun for the whole family!!  Cute little western restaurant, petting Zoo, and old nevada town.  Nice little adventourous get away for the kids."}
{"text":"We were looking for an event venue for a very large group and when we came across BSR on the internet we inquired about the services. Karin was extremely helpful! Even though we didn't end up booking there, Karin's knowledge and help was in valuable! Thank you Karin, for being patient and wonderful with us!"}
{"text":"Very cool spot. The reason for the 4* rating is because of the lady out by the horse stables who clearly doesn't work here. Acting like she's in charge. Some people need to learn to stay in there lane. Mind your own f$@)ing business. She's lucky I had my kids with me. Otherwise she would have gotten served."}
{"text":"Restaurant review: Overall 4 stars. Highlights: French toast and blueberry pancakes were a hit and both were large portions.  Veggie omelet was good, 4 stars. Scrambled eggs were a little overcooked for my taste, but still okay. Coffee was good, but a little cold (and I'm picky). Service was very good and the waiter was very nice. Nice, casual atmosphere. Empty on this Monday morning at 10am. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"It sounds like if we went on the weekend we might have given another star. But we didn't. The town is staffed by two guys, and everything is closed and locked as a result. One of the workers told me they couldn't have the buildings open because of vandals. I understand that, but sounds like you need more staff. The train doesn't run and there is no posse show on weekdays. The petting zoo is okay, but I would have liked to see more local wildlife there, although wallabies are cool. I did have a deer start to eat my shirt, which the kids were thrilled by. Perhaps if they didn't charge full price on weekdays I would have been more understanding of half the features being unavailable. We likely won't be back."}
{"text":"It was the first time visiting this place it was okay,  but the food was definitely NOT good, I orded a salmon salad the salad was very plain and it was very old and damaged,  I returned it,  and then I got the meatloaf and it wasn't that good either,  I wouldn't recommend. Service wasn't that great either. But definitely something different"}
{"text":"Saddest place I ever went to. Actually cut my four day stay short after seeing 3 horses repeatedly whipped about the face & neck with riding crops. They were trying to back away but the girls on the ground were holding their reins while  a female trainer was yelling at them to hit them harder and not to stop. It's the worst thing Ive ever witnessed. When we yelled over the fence to stop hitting the horses, the trainer yelled at us to mind our own business! This all took place right outside our motel room!  We we're so upset, we ran up to the office. The girl there looked horrified and immediately called owners. She said they were on their way & lived on the property. We ran back out just as older man and woman rode up in a golf cart. They were both hostile & insisted no animal was being abused on their ranch. The female trainer continued to sneer and yell at us, saying  there wasn't a mark on the horses and to bring anyone I liked there to check them out. I told them I would be contacting  animal abuse groups and went back to my room &  packed my bags. The owners never once acted like i was a paying guest on their property. What awful people!  Also, horses that were used all day for trail rides in the Nevada sun were put in pasture for evening, again right outside our room, without being rubbed down. Saddle marking and sweat still pouring down them. And don't get me started on the petting zoo. The fact that I had spent a considerable amount of money to enjoy a vacation which was ruined & cut short is nothing compared to the saddness I have for  those poor animals."}
{"text":"Bonnie SCREAMS (Halloween experience) was such a fu**ing joke! Literally hundreds of guests being HAD. So understaffed. Had to wait 55 minutes in the ticket line (even tho we purchased tickets online and printed them) just to wait 70 minutes for the zombie bus which was mediocre. Finally after three hours it was time to go into the park. Took the \"scary train\"...nothing scary happened. Went through one haunted house. And ONE person popped out to scare us (didn't). Fat fucking FAIL! WHERE WERE ALL THE ACTORS?!?! The only place to get ANY food was the bar. The offered pre-packed plain cafeteria hot dogs and hamburgers at $7 BUCKS EACH!! $2 for a bag of chips?! FUCK YOU BONNIE SCREAMS! Needless to say we didn't eat being that my friend is vegetarian. So, nothing to eat, no screams to be heard because the only people working there were the ones taking $40 per person to wait in crazy long lines that led to an utterly underwhelming experience. They probably made $40-$80,000 last night. They did NOT earn any of that. So infuriating. They only things that were scary were the lines and prices."}
{"text":"I have to say - had I written this review last year it would probably have been three stars.  The ambiance has ALWAYS been there - great little lake view - feeding ducks - great roaring fire in the winter - rustic and relaxing however the food wasn't ever very good (save the amazing hot chocolate and bread pudding).  And I'm talking we've been going here for maybe 20 or more years.    My family and I went recently (June 2012) and I have to say the food quality was GREATLY improved!  I'm happy to say it because I love going to this place and getting out of the city.  We got the BBQ ribs, chicken friend steak, salmon, hot chocolates and bread pudding.  From the moment the salad got there I could see the difference in the food quality just from a year ago.  VERY fresh salad with garbanzos, ripe lovely grape tomatoes, baby corn, carrots etc.  Really good.  Ribs were good, chicken fried steak had the BEST gravy on it (and you know white gravy is hard to do well), salmon was 'ok' a bit fishy for my taste but very flavorful and seasoned well and of course the bread pudding and hot chocolate NEVER disappoint.  Our waitress - I wish I remembered her name, was AWESOME - she was refilling before we even asked, pleasant and on the ball. (UPDATE:  Her name was JASMINE - she's the BEST)  I'm happy to be able to write this review.  The food is MUCH better than year's past so if you haven't been in a while - make the trip!  :)  It's worth it."}
{"text":"We saw the chapel on our last visit to Bonnie Springs.  That would be an interesting place to have a wedding, in my opinion.  Not exactly my cup of tea, but there is an ass for every saddle, right?    I wrote a more detailed review about Bonnie Springs, which I am pasting here:  \"My friend first introduced us to Bonnie Springs one day on a drive out to Red Rock Canyon.  Since then, we have returned a few times with other guests on the way to one of our favorite hiking spots.    My friend first told us he was taking us to the \"demented animal farm\".  He said that this place takes in all types of animals, including ones that have been injured or abandoned in the desert over the years.  We are talking everyting from deer, hogs and wolves to exotic animals like the Australian Lynx.  They even have a peacock.  When we arrived, we found that Bonnie Springs was a lot more than a shelter for discarded animals.  There was an old western town, a train, a small motel, a pond with ducks, and a restaurant.  All of that on top of a large (and growing) section of animals.  What makes this especially funny/interesting is that this place is literally in the middle of nowhere!  The animals are my favorite.  Not only is this a free attraction, but you get to pet and feed many of the animals.  Many are in cages or are fenced in, but some are just wandering freely.  One deer, in particular, ate food from my hand as he stood next to me in the corridor.  I would say that this place is safe for children, but know in advance that this is not like a zoo.  Closed-toe shoes are recommended as the ground is rocky and uneven.  I did not see any \"demented animals\" but there are a few that have obviously had some trauma.  I always donate a few dollars.  Everytime I return, the place is larger and there are more animals.  The old western town is interesting.  Apparently, they have shows on certain days, but it was like a ghost town the last time I went.  We had one funny thing happen here.  We went into the candy store to look around.  My nephew wanted a chocolate bar.  As he was getting one from the shelf, I saw a small mouse run across the floor.  I didn't say anything.  When we got outside and he opened his milk chocolate bar, we were all horrified to find it was completely white!  Have you even seen brown chocolate turn white?  I told my nephew to keep it as it may be an artifact.  Overall, this place is a trip.  Truly worth a quick visit if you are passing through, but I wouldn't plan a day around it.\""}
{"text":"Very neat little place tucked into the dessert. Try the bison burger and raspberry tea. Also very friendly staff. My husband and I added a dollar to the bar ceiling (you sign the money & it goes to charity). Overall nice oasis!"}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs Ranch has managed to become a must stop during my recent Vegas trips. As mentioned in my Red Rock Review, this area of Nevada is definitely a site for sore eyes.. being off the strip and all. Bring your boots, cause this town is dirt and dust!   I'm a total fan of places like this. Growing up my father often watched Western movies and shows in excess (still does). Because of this, I've got soft spots for any and all replications with regards to the looks & feel of a Western town and its overall environment. It's located about 10 minutes beyond Red Rock National Park just off Red Rock Canyon Road.. \"Country-side\".  Driving up you'll notice a little train station, house / motel, a few wild animals and a road leading you up to the main Bonnie Springs area. We even encountered a donkey at one point! Tre cool. Although it wasn't crowded during my most recent visit, I've gone up during peak hours where the crowds were of plenty. They have tours, shows, events, zoo and a museum for all your entertainment needs.. and I'll assume this is what the crowd was there for.  The bar / restaurant next to the zoo is pretty neat too! It definitely has that 'Western' cozy cabin-like feel with a fireplace smack dab in the center. A couple of cow horns and skulls, dim lights, deer skins and a lil' more are the decor. The thing you WILL notice upon entering is the plethora of dollars hung from the ceiling. Every so often they'll gather enough cash, add it up and donate it to the charity of their choice! You're quite the righteous gal, Bonnie. They jam out that country music us city folk never get to hear which at times, can be quite soothing to the ear. The only downer, for a beer boy like myself.. is they only have (had) one beer on tap... Flat Tire. I'm cool with a flat tire at home, but it's never necessarily my go to when hitting a bar. A shot of whiskey accompanies it, which they have plenty of! Plus, like most places in Vegas if you play, the tip is really all you have to pay! Via bar top they have your typical digital machines with blackjack, poker and so on.   Bonnie Springs has a lot going and is definitely worth the quick visit."}
{"text":"Loved this little gem hidden away outside of Red Rock. Surprisingly good food and a very sweet waitress. The ambience is fun for sure. If you can handle it, order the 1/2 lb bison burger!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bonnie Springs for years and years.  Little has changed, and a lot has stayed the same.  This place is an \"experience\".  Come with an open mind, while the sun is still up if possible and bring walking shoes.  Bonnie Springs is an old dude ranch/motel/old town museum/petting zoo/restaurant/bar etc. etc.  It's sort of hard to describe really.    If you come during daylight hours you can walk around and see some of the birds and maybe the wild burros that live on the land.  At night, it is not advised to wander around in the dark - the burros are mean.  The bar is fun - no neckties allowed.  If you enter wearing one, you are given two choices - either remove it, or it will be cut off, and hung on the wall.    There is a big stone woodburning fireplace with chairs all around that is perfect for puting your boots up and having a beer while you wait for a table.    The food is wonderful - simple menu, wholesome, basic meat and potatoes menu that can't be beat.  After a day in the saddle, sit down with friends and a hearty apetite.  The salad is fresh and crisp, the ranch style potato is delicious, and the steaks are all divine.  Service is unobtrusive, friendly.  If you want another side of Las Vegas (25 minutes outside of Vegas), this feels like a million miles away!"}
{"text":"Went to Bonnie Springs today. The old town experience was a bit disappointing but ok if you have dome time and want to get out of Vegas for the day. The restaurant had that old Western feel and the food-typically saloon style wasn't bad. I had the ranch sampler and my pardoner had the bison burger which he said was tasty. We shared a home made cherry pie al mode which was really nice."}
{"text":"The photos speak for themselves here, I mean what else is there to say? We've stayed here twice...the first time we got a regular room because I was trying to stay within a budget. This time we splurged and got a themed room w/ jetted hot tub. I didn't know, but it came with a complimentary bottle of champagne. WINNING. I love this place. The family at the check in desk are funny and witty and just all around welcoming and polite. It's beautiful all times of year with the majestic Red Rocks surrounding. I hope we get to go on a Horseback Ride this time. If not, excuse to come back soon! Clean. Big beds. Large jetted hot tub with plenty of mirrors! Lots of pillows. Intricate lighting. Nearby petting zoo and horse stables. Big shower with seats."}
{"text":"Went for a ride in Red Rock Canyon, then to Blue Diamond, and then I was famished. The guy at the bike shop in Blue Diamond recommended the burgers at this place. The waitress here said the buffalo burgers were the most popular. I think both said people come here specifically for the burgers. Good suggestions from both. The burger was good, if a little pricey at $12.99 (iirc.) Better than eating on the strip though, and you have little choice if you're on a bicycle around Red Rock Canyon. So no complaints, totally glad it's there. It's a little tacky theme resorty, but a welcome dose of civilization in an area where it feels like it's so far away!"}
{"text":"The old west hasn't been completely washed away.  Well, in spirit at least.  Bonnie Springs came about long ago when a well-to-do New Yorker fell in love with a western belle named Bonnie who just loved the ol' cowboy times.  He loved her so much that he bought her a huge ranch and bought up any and all old ghost towns and antiques he could find and built her, her own wild west town.  It has been a treasured place for all of Las Vegas for years.  You can enjoy it if your young or decrepit.  It's not so far out into the RedRock canyon and the mountain view is majestic as all Hell.  You will find an entrance to what looks like an old miner town.  Buy your tickets here and see the live cowboy shows.  Explore the long lost era in a semi-cheesy retro amusement park way.  A wax museum, shoot'n gallery, old mill, little white chapel, saloon, school house, \"old mine\" and a small pastime museum can all be experienced in this town.  The entrance to the petting zoo is accessed through one of the trading posts.  The petting zoo is uber neat!  Here you will encounter a Canadian lynx, wallabies, llama, wolf, porcupine, reindeer, donkeys, miniature horses and such along with the usual chickens, goats pot bellies, etc. roaming petting zoo assortment.  The zoo is a swarm of activity that's both fun & quirky even if you've been to a billion petting zoo's.  I used to board my black Percheron draft horse at the stables in the back.  Greatest experience ever.  Exit through the town and you can take a ride on Bonnies train.  What a complete package so far, huh?  After the train ride you can head to the south and see an old pond with turtles and ducks.  behind is the pony rides and a few steer pens.  *Walk into the bar and have a few MEGA STRONG Long Island Iced Tea's* or just have a beer.  Hang out by the fire pit (in the winter) and get a bite of some cowboy grub.  Food is rather good and not pricey for being out of town.  Buffalo Bison burgers, corn fritters (so bomb!) steaks, bbq ribs and the like.  What would you expect if you were at an old west town?  4 star?  Come on, this isn't the strip and it isn't a resort casino.  Sometimes you see ol' miss Bonnie come to the restaurant and visit still.    I am a fan of Bonnie Springs and have been way before I had my kids.  Now I'm happy that this place is still around for my little clones to enjoy too!  Even If you aren't a fan of cowboy movies, I bet you would still have a gay olde time.  hehe"}
{"text":"WEll we took the kids and it was so fun without allot of money. We just had ice cream at restaurant and it was homemade and yummy!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that is in the middle of no where, surrounded with animals and mountains.  I find this place to be very interesting and unique.    Bonnie Springs Restaurant, located far west off Charleston and Gunfighter. Since its way out there, it's not as big of a restaurant but a decent size.  The outside of it, is well maintained, even though it does look run down.  But inside is very nice and kept clean.  A bit confusing at first, since, we weren't sure where the entrance was, cause the doorway was kind of small and  unsure if we should seat ourselves or wait for the waitress.  But the place was busy, and it seem like it's a popular place.  Then again, we went during lunch hours, so I'm sure it was busy cause of that.    The waitress was very nice and friendly, and seated us close to the fire place.  I find it interesting and unique that the tables were made like it was cut out from a tree.  The wooden seats, could be a bit more comfortable, but it wasn't as bad.    Since it was lunch hours, it did take a while to get the waitress to take our orders.  I don't mind the wait, as long as there's a reason for a waitress to be late.  Of course, being lunch hours, it's quite understandable. When the waitress came around, I ordered the pull pork sandwich, that came with coleslaw and fries.  I got my food at a reasonable time.   I did eat almost everything on my plate and find it very fulfilling and tasty.  The pull pork was nice and tender, the bread of the sandwich was nice and soft.  Wasn't to fond of the fries, but It was edible.  (I'm not much of a french fry guy, cause of the grease its cooked in.  But I do love bake potatoes.)   Overall, if you are in the area, don't hesitate to stop in the restaurant.  It may look run down on the outside, but very decent looking inside.  Make sure you bring your appetite.  For a small restaurant, they sure serve you with big portions.  They even have a pond out front that has turtles.  So before or after you eat, you should check them out too."}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision to go to Bonnie Springs for spring break... The staff at the hotel was great... The maid service could use some more work. The beds were the only thing done when we returned.. The coffee was not very well thought out. They should use the four cup coffee packets instead of the single cup ones... Very week coffee.... The restaurant was good... I noticed the same thing that others did... We ordered our food and a big group came in, ordered, and got their food way before we did. We loved the turtle pond and seeing them sunning themselves out on the rocks... Saw someone pick one up...  The old town was just okay.. We did come on one their dark days... Wished they'd have at least someone around to give us a history... The petting zoo was a fun... Enjoyed living in all the animals and watching their antics when someone would put a quarter in the feeding dispenser... Especially the donkey... You can tell all the animals are well cared for... Hoping to go back again, but when the old town is open with shows and all."}
{"text":"just left the restaurant and was waited on by a short tattooed Latino who lacked charm! He rudely asked one of the guest not to fold the menu and snatched it out of his hand because it might tear! He also brought me a lemonade when I asked for ice tea and made an extra remark that he doesn't recall me asking for ice tea as he would've asked which flavor!! additionally when I ordered the gizzard and veggie appetizer he made a comment that he doesn't understand why some people that come here don't order real homemade food and lastly he forgot to bring my veggie appetizer! He needs to get his head out of the cloud and come down to earth! we were generous enough to give him 5% tip."}
{"text":"Apple pie a la mode was the best ever; seriously!"}
{"text":"Not worth the time and money we spent. Restaurant ok not all that. Didn't find any thing interesting and the zoo was just SAD!"}
{"text":"This is a fun way to step back in time to the old west.  Gun fights, hangings, mellow dramas, a saloon with sasparilla, wax museum, one room school house, a petting zoo with very unique animals, plastic a restaurant that is fabulous."}
{"text":"We arrived here on the second leg of our week long spring break trip after 3 nights and 4 days of camping at Jumbo Rocks in Joshua Tree. The views are amazing with the beautiful views of the Red Rocks. Check in was easy and the ladies helping were very friendly. I have to say one person shined and her name is Kay. She was super patient when my kids locked us out not once, but twice!!  Then brought up a bag to our room full of electronics that my son left on the ground by the car. Her husband Roy who is a wrangler at the horse stables found my sons lost watch and she even brought it up. She refused a tip! Such amazing service.  The best was the horse ride in the morning.  Very fun and breath taking views. Steve was very knowledgeable on flora and fauna of the desert. Kris and Roy were great too. My kids had a blast. We ate dinner and breakfast at the restaurant. Both were good and prices were decent. Bar tender was friendly, wait staff were pretty ok. Our breakfast waitress was a bit rude.  The hotel is cute but older. Clean, comfortable and Decently priced. The kids loved the animals. We really didn't go the town or petting zoo. We visited Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire instead.  I say skip Vegas with all of its craziness. Come here and you may even see a wild burrow. We did and it was so cool! It's a little cheesy and a whole lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Cute little place to take the kids. Theres a petting zoo, a \"wild west town\" (more like a street, but there are shops to poke around in), and a restaurant which we didnt try. Theres also a pretty nice train ride.   Its kind of run down, but thats appropriate for the theme, so we didnt mind.  Its cooler up here near the mountains and windier too so bring a sweater!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. A restaurant inside of a themed attraction. Style. Don't expect disney world, but totally is refreshing from the desert."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs Ranch is a pleasant change of pace from Las Vegas. It is about 25 mins from the strip located near Red Rock Canyon. It offers a taste of the Old West in a very scenic setting.    They have cowboy shows, a wax museum, gift shops, a petting zoo and a mini train ride.  One of the cowboy shows is a hanging trial and gun fight. All of these are only $10.   Be sure to check the schedule so that you don't miss the melodrama and other shows. Crowd participation is encouraged--and can make the experience one of a kind.  The petting zoo is small. Some animals are in cages and others walking around. There are pigs, llamas, guineas, goats, chickens, sheep, and wolves.    I like the rustic saloon.  I had a pulled pork sandwich which is good. There is a pond next to the restaurant with ducks. There are a lot of pictures opportunity. I would recommend going on a cooler days."}
{"text":"Come with your best Wild West positive attitude and enjoy this place. I feel transported, with a little suspension of disbelief, when I come here.  Sure, it's tacky. And kitschy.  And corny.  That's part of the fun.  I always have a good time.  You are so close to the mountains, even more so in some ways than at Red Rock.  You can't beat that.  The amusement park part is a hoot.  Fake shoot-outs and a melodrama play. This is good stuff, people. Especially if you have kids, or if you're a kid at heart, like me and my husband! The restaurant has some decent offerings.  Try their burger.  The duck pond and petting zoo are calming, and make you remember what you are doing here...enjoy life, people!"}
{"text":"A fun slightly out of the way place to hang and forget life. The petting zoo is my favorite with the animals (deer, goats, Desert Tortoises, wolves, and some other cute exotic animals that will surely put a smile on your face.They will chew on your shirt if you're not careful. This Old West Town is pretty cool with lots of neat antiques including an old Studebaker. There are three silly hokey Wild West Shows that are probably better after having a drink in the Saloon. There are also shops, a ghost town with tours (I think) shooting gallery and old time photo shoot shop. And stay for dinner and enjoy real ranch type Bar B Que at the restaurant with live country music on Fridays and classic pop rock folky music on Saturday evenings. End the evening with a sunset and search for wild burrows. The burrows have babies now so that is fun to see along with jackrabbits, rabbits and of course some peacocks roaming the main ranch area. Have fun!"}
{"text":"This place is a fun get away that's close to home. It has the old cowboy feel and good BBQ to match. The service is friendly and fast.  I have yet to be disappointed in the food. They are very kid friendly! Huge bonus!"}
{"text":"Had a very fun visit with my in-laws, husband and 4 year old son.  The Old West town is great and authentic.  The shows were fun but the shoot-out/\"hanging\" was way, way too intense for my son.  They have one of those old-fashioned, metal playground merry-go-round things and we just did that while the others watched the show.   The zoo - part is fine, but there are a couple animals that just don't seem suited for the type of zoo they have.  I am generally a zoo supporter but I do wish they would just make it a typical petting zoo and get rid of the few animals which have to stay in their cages.    I would have given this place five stars except for one issue - there was litter all over certain parts - especially in the displays in the wax museum.  We were there three days after Halloween and I understand that they have a big event, so maybe they just hadn't had a chance to do a thorough pick up.    The train ride is short, but you can ride it as many times as you want with admission, so my son was happy.  We did not eat in the restaurant but the food looked great.  We also did not have time to do the pony ride but I did take a look and the animals look well-cared for.    I would expect we will be coming back to Bonnie Springs whenever we visit my in-laws, as they live out near Red Rocks.  Overall a fun, good value.  Oh, and check the website for coupons."}
{"text":"We went here after hiking in Red Rocks and it was fantastic. The burgers are great but besides the food, the service is top notch. Victoria was our server and even though it was her first day, she came off as though she had been there for years and we were regular customers. We plan on making this a traditional stop when we come to Vegas and really hope you do too."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Bonnie Springs Ranch & Old Nevada since I was 5!! Have been here soooo many times & is always a great time! Watch a melodrama, have a root beer, watch a gunfight, visit the petting zoo...so much to do here & is a wonderful family outing!!!"}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs restaurant is a good place.  Our hiking group has stopped there twice as we came through the property from our hike.  Today, we had breakfast or lunch depending on who ordered what.  We also had a birthday cake we brought served to one of our hikers as a surprise.  The crew at Bonnie Springs were very helpful in helping us with the surprise.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries, and it was very nice.  Two others had the pulled chicken, and they were pleased with that.  Three people got breakfast, 2 omelets and some blueberry pancakes, and they enjoyed their meals.  All in all, it was a good place to stop.  The food took awhile getting ready.  This is my only complaint.    One funny thing, as you wait, you can watch the ducks and swans swim by in the pond outside the restaurant.  A few times, the swans swam by and with just the neck showing, it looked like something out of jaws.  I recommend this place if you're out in the Red Rock area.  There is no admission fee if you're there simply for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets a 1 star is because of the restaurant.  The actual town and zoo its self gets a 3 star. I have been going to Bonnie Springs since 1988 and yes the place is a little worse for wear but it's old. The actors are nice and will sit and talk with you in between shows. The petting zoo use to be much bigger but it is still good that animals are still a part of this place. What really sucks is that this place is not open on Mondays, it's only open Wednesday through Sunday   Ok now the restaurant part  They have redone the menu but that is not always s good thing. We were seated and it took about 5 minutes for someone to come over to us and ask us for drinks. We were sitting there for another 10 minutes and a group of 6 come in, no big deal it's not busy in there anyways. We finally ordered a starter along with our meal. Almost 15 minutes later the group gets served exactly what we ordered as our starter, they got ours and now we have to wait yet again for another to be made. WOW!!!!! I got the fish & chips meal and I DO NOT recommend it to anyone that has taste buds. The fish needs to be seasoned and not mushy. Put a little bit of lemon pepper on it for GODs sake. It left a bad taste in my mouth. My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was ok and it was dry, at least put more BBQ sauce on it before you serve it or put some on the side. Our waiter shouldn't have been at work today because serving is his job and he lacked those skills. My 10 year old could have done it better. Customer service in the restaurant needs so much improvement!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always fun and cool to visit.  They did not have the train running from the farther lot as usual to bring you to the front door but still fun.  It has worn down over the years but looks like an old town so the despair is not as noticeable unless you have gone there for years like me.  The restaurant is ok, nothing special but has decent food and prices are not too bad"}
{"text":"Bonnie screams So not worth it! An hour and a half in the general line even if the tickets purchased ahead of time online! Zombie bus sold out even before the attraction was opened. You wait in line to get tickets and then wait again to get on the bus. Can't review it since we didn't get to go on it to my kids big disappointment! The ghost trail is a joke! 10 minute walk on a dark dusty Not decorated trail. The whole trail had one spider in the bushes and that's it! The haunted train is another joke. On the way we encountered a chainsaw guy once and that's it! Even my 6 year old said: \"That's it?\" Haunted houses are so disappointing! There are only 3 and they are not scary at all. There are just a few actors in there and half of them aren't even dressed up! They jump out at you wearing regular hoodies! Very few shows and characters outside the haunted houses. The food is limited, disgusting, and very expensive.   My totals were $100 for 4 tickets (no discount for kids), and $45 for 4 cold hamburgers, 3 hot chocolates, and 1 beer. So not worth it! You better off going to Fright Dome!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise after the Red Rock Canyon scenic drive. We had steak, and it was good and reasonably cooked. Not really gourmet food, to be clear, but very good flavor.  Service was okay, I seriously don't understand some of the other reviews.  It was a bit pricy but surely nowhere near the prices on the strip."}
{"text":"Worth the short drive.  This place is really cool.  No fee to get to the restaurant.  Duck pond next to it.  Also, many peacocks around.  You can look at horses, ponies, a long horn steer, and buffalo.  The place has a real old-timey feel.  A huge fire fit inside.  Great for just hanging out.  They had live music when we arrived.  Simply wonderful atmosphere.  We shared a Bonnie Springs Burger, which had 1/2 lb of meat.  The food was slightly better than mediocre and a little over priced.  Like I said, its worth the drive just to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs is one of my most favorite places to go.  It's far enough out of town to forget the Strip, and close enough, about 1/2 hour away depending on where you live int he valley. I ALWAYS recommended it to tourists when I was a concierge.  It's great for families, a lot of groups I see are Grandparents with their Grand kids. I usually get annoyed by kids yelling and screaming in public places, but this is mostly outdoors and kids are usually to happy to see the animals and wild, wild, west to scream.  The restaurant I'm told was built partially by the hands of Bonnie herself. One of the times we went, we actually got to meet her as she was having dinner at the bar. Off to the side you can see pictures of her when she performed as an ice skater and showgirl on the strip!  This is one of the stories you wish you could have. This is someone who has done something with her (and her husband's) money to not only preserve history, give a place for kids to go, shelter animals. Howard Hughes used to come in the restaurant and hang out. He's offered Bonnie several BLANK checks so he could acquire her ranch and the land. And bless Bonnie, she never budged.   The zoo has become a refuge for animals, obtained from zoos, strip performers like magicians. The sheriffs and BLM have been known to bring exotic animals that have been abandoned in the area that are too big/ unique to bring to the dog/ cat shelters in the valley.   There is always work to be done at Bonnie's. A lot of buildings need maintenance and refurbishing. We usually go to Bonnie's and spend a lot of money there, gladly, to help out. We go to the restaurant to celebrate something and go when we're starving.   You take all this in before you even get inside the restaurant. they used to have the menus printed on 5ths of alcoholic bottles: green bottles for breakfast (which I believe they still use). they changed the menu, so the lunch may not be on the clear bottles and dinner on the brown bottles anymore.   On Every table, you see a proclamation for Bonnie Levinson day every July. Her birthday is on the 31st, which to my disappointment, just found out about. (I write this aug 10th, I may still be able to go over there to wish her well).  We usually share an appetizer, last time it was potato skins. We've gotten beef sandwiches, bbq chicken. We can never seem to make it to desert. BUT, I do order Sarsparilla there, it's one of the few places that has it. It's one of the best sodas that I don't find in stores anymore.  In the winter, it does get cold out there. They have a fire pit by the entrance between the bar. On those occasions, we usually sit around it in the lounge chairs provided and sip a coffee drink, kahlua, bailey's, irish... They play country music which I enjoy. I used to think country sucked and was the music of depression, they always sing about losing a job, wife, dog, etc. But I even enjoy country and western music more because I associate it with this place. i've grown to appreciate it in general, part of it is vintage and a lot of songs are surprisingly topical and tell stories far better than pop/ rap/ hip hop music can.   She's been there since 1952 I believe. Bonnie springs is like a local Knott's berry farm, especially before it became a rides park. The restaurant is one of the most modern places at Bonnie Springs with cable tv at the bar, which is strange, but I suppose necessary for business. I don't believe the Saloon has TV's on, so that may be the most authentic watering hole on Property.  I first went there for Halloween festivities. We even got a hotel room and went on the horseback ride the next morning. I even understand that George Carlin freaked out once and left the strip and stayed at one of the rooms to get away. Was it after the fallout with MGM?   All in all, excellent experiences every time we've gone. when you think of vintage Vegas in the 50's, the wild, wild west, and those postcards of the Grand Canyon when tourists used to dress up like cowboys, this is the place that maintains that classic experience."}
{"text":"Okay, this is kind of a non-review because we actually didn't go inside.  It's in a great location, with beautiful mountain scenery and it could have some great things to do inside, but it's so.......negative.  Don't park here, don't picnic here, don't do this, don't do that.  Don't, don't, don't....We were just turned off from all the negative stuff even before we bought tickets, that we just got back in the car and left."}
{"text":"Located outside of Las Vegas, this old western town features a chapel, saloon, petting zoo and shooting gallery.  It's a fun time."}
{"text":"Went hiking at Red Rock yesterday and decided to go check out Bonnie Springs after the hike. This place is really cool. I loved the old western theme as you pull in. They also had a cool train that picks you up from the parking lot that takes you to the western town. That was fun . We made our way towards the restaurant and bar. As you walk into the bar there are dollar bills hung everywhere with patrons that have visited. I thought that was really unique. We ate in the restaurant side. I ordered a glass of wine and chicken wings. Kind of pricey bit the wings were delicious . Cooked perfectly, crispy the way i like it and not to spicy. The service was good too. They were very friendly. I really enjoyed myself. I saw they had a free petting zoo but i never had a chance to check it out. I will for sure on my next visit and I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great place to get a bison burger. Prices are decent and quality of food are constant. I will always dine here as long as the service and food stay the same. On a cold night the restaurant has a nice fire going."}
{"text":"I loved this place. My husband, my mother and I went for the first time and we had such a nice experience. Totally different then what you'll see on the strip. And that's a good thing!  We had lunch at the restaurant. Mostly burgers and sandwiches on the menu m. They also have a full bar which is nice.   We enjoyed the little ducks, roosters and peacocks! Lovely place to chill and spend the afternoon!"}
{"text":"Usually stop by the restaurant here after a ride through Red Rock Canyon, by far they have the best Bison Burger I have ever eaten.   Atmosphere is old school wild west. 32 different beers at the bar.  Staff and patrons are friendly and fun to talk to."}
{"text":"Quiet getaway from the strip. So much history here and I felt like I was actually at a different place. The whole place had a character to it. The restaurant is a little bit pricey but the food is good."}
{"text":"This place is *bleeping* good.  It's hard for me to not describe this particular restaurant without the use of expletives to get my point across, but holy *bleep*, this food is incredible!  Located just before the main gate, this little restaurant is tucked away to the side.  When you walk in, the scent of food just hits you in waves as you take in the rustic charm.  The warmth of the fireplace on that particularly chilly day was a welcome addition, and just felt great to crowd around.  We ordered a sampler platter with our beers, and some bison back ribs.    Let me make that point again.  Stop cross-referencing Facebook while you read this and look at what I've written here: BISON back ribs.  And I nearly lost it, they were go utterly *bleeping* good.  The appetizer, consisting of chicken fingers, onion rings, and bacon cheddar potato wedges were no slouch, and my friend and I alternated freely between our food options.  For all I know, I may have been horrifying as I greedily consumed this barbeque, but my \"Inner Texan\" kicked in, and it was just over at that point.  I'm sorry.  No, actually, you know what?  I'm not sorry.  At all.  I make no apologies for food that *bleeping* good.  This would undoubtedly be a fantastic winter restaurant to sit in, enjoy the fire, and eat mighty vittles in a cozy atmosphere.  Considering that I found it so late, I'll make it a Spring/Summer place in the meantime so I can get it right later in the year.  I don't know if they have live music there, but I think it would be a nice fit if they did.  I loved the old pictures of Bonnie on the wall.  She's a charming gal.  Want *bleeping* GOOD food?  Here's a spot.  One that I'll gladly and repeatedly return to.  *bleep* yeah...."}
{"text":"We went today (Sunday) & decided to try the restaurant on another review here about the Bison burger being \"the best I've ever had\". We waited about 15-20 minutes to be seated (no wait list or pager system). After we sat down & ordered, the waitress said the orders were taking about 36 minutes to come out. We did notice that the table that sat down/ordered after us, got their food before we did (as others have mentioned here)? Food took about 40 minutes & the Bison Burger was excellent!! My wife got the grilled chicken sandwich, but it was undercooked & was sent back. They brought us another one right away though (must've been another customers order) & it was really good once they cooked it correctly."}
{"text":"Is this the best food ever?  No.  The whole day trip to Bonnie Springs requires you to eat here.  Now, the staff are super friendly.  They get that you have brought your kids for some fun.  They are fast on the refills.  The kids meals are a little overpriced, but yeck, its a fun day!  The kids liked their food and eat it (the way they usually do).  The food was good, if not a little too much of it.  (Not going to take it home to Henderson)."}
{"text":"Dismal faded never was destination. Dusty, smelly, grim. Dying animals. Lethargic staff.  4 of us went one morning. Paid the exorbitant ripoff fee and went inside. Once inside we are told most exhibits are closed. Also the bar is closed. I go to cashier and demand refund. She tells me sorry no refunds. I ask her why, since the place is mostly closed did she SELL US FUCKING TICKETS? She said that is just the way it is. I tell the bitch to hand over the cash or I will fucking ventilate her. The troll handed over the cash. TOTAL CLIP JOINT.  Sad, pathetic tourist trap."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Vegas multiple times and were looking for something non strip related to entertain our whole party of mostly older adults. I came across this brochure, we had a car and it was reasonably priced so it seemed like something worthy of checking out. Its also located in the Red Rock Canyon which is a place I had been wanting to check out forever. Our brochure even had a coupon for 2$ off the admission price of 10$. The brochure didn't give as much info as we needed, but we were able to check the website and learn about the current hours and dark days (no shows) on the website. Make sure you check the show times as this is a huge part of the fun of going here, and it would be a shame to come and miss out on this.  The ride out here was beautiful, being from Washington State we do not have similar mountains or vegetation. I really wanted to stop to get my picture with a cactus on the driveway to the ranch, but no one thought I was serious. The train outside also allowed for some photo opportunities as well, but beware it only runs on the weekends. We enjoyed being greeted by some town folk immediately after entering Old Town. My family enjoys interactive events and loved that you could engage with the actors in both the town and the shows. The shows themselves were surprisingly entertaining, but you may want to bring some sunscreen and water for the hanging as it is in the direct sun.   Afterwards the wax museum opens and you can look at some famous figures from how the Old West came to be. We didn't understand that this was guided and missed hearing most of what was being said. It would definitely be worth a 2nd look as the guide went through very fast and we didn't have much time for pictures or reading the signage. The old buildings are cool to look at, but a little run down as can be expected in any ghost town. The Old West Museum was also cool to look at. I hope to check out the ghost adventures episode about the paranormal activity here, but was able to ask the actors about it while there. The actors are very helpful and had lots of information about both Bonnie Springs and even great recommendations for places to check out in Vegas and the surrounding area.   We checked out the stores as well. My Aunt was happy with her cheap purse, my Uncle kept raving about the prices and I felt like I scored with some 3$ earrings. It would have been cool if the shooting gallery was in working order, but still fun to look at. If I ever go again I hope to make it in October for Bonnie Screams and to check out the restaurant."}
{"text":"It is tough to tell if this place is genuine old west country charm or if it is just kinda run down out in the country...  I think it is just kinda run down and sorta gross.  You definately want to love this place because it has history and lotsa potential.  The owners of this place can do better.  The oldwest town and trail rides are good for the kids but this is about the restaurant.  The food is basic bar food with a few wild game selections.  I had a barbecue pork sandwich that was barely ok.  The restaurant was very dirty.  You can have old west country carm with out being gross.  They have a ranch like area right outside the restaurant where you can walk around.  Peacocks walking around.    The have an American Bison in a tiny little coral and it looked sick.  They had a water tub full of dirty gross water.  They had no shelter for it.  Not even a damn tree to get away from the 100 degree heat!  I don't think the poor thing could even move.  It was sad to see an animal like that penned up for show at some dumpy local attraction...  This isn't a chicken or a pig -  this is an American Bison!    MAybe Yelpers can stage a late night ... Bison Break-out and set him free!!!!  He can run with the burros!   The nicest thing I can say is the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs is a quaint restaurant near Red Rock Canyon outside of Las Vegas. The atmosphere was eclectic with families visiting the zoo and couples enjoying a Sunday afternoon cocktail. I had the salmon on a bed of greens. It was very good!"}
{"text":"We finally made it out here for the 1st time on Saturday. I'll admit some of the reviews made me nervous but I thought it was great. If you want to avoid reading what became a verrrry long review, I would just say head out there. It's worth a trip.  I should probably say that my husband grew up on a ranch, and I have been to many, so I am coming from that viewpoint. Were parts dirty and smelly? Yes. Is that every single ranch on the planet? Yes!  We got the $10 wristbands and headed in to the show in the saloon. It was silly and hokey, but fun, and not too long with lots of audience participation. I will admit, my husband and I enjoyed it more than the kids,  so maybe adults who didn't grow up in the techie age will appreciate old time silly entertainment like that.  Next we headed to the petting zoo. Lots of people have commented on the animals in cages, and yes, it does tug at the heart a little, but I choose to think those are not kidnapped from the wild type animals, but instead wouldn't make it in the wild, being cared for there, animals. My kids loved the variety of animals they had, and especially loved petting the deer.   After that we walked through the various buildings that housed wild west type stuff which was interesting to look at, the mine, which was pretty neat, and the wax museum which was kind of hokey, but still cool, and for some reason, super dark, which actually made walking through more fun :)  To finish up, we headed to the pond, which had tons of ducks and turtles, which the kids loved and past it to where there were more peacocks and peahens then I have ever seen anywhere. The kids were in heaven with that!  Lastly, we took the train ride which was a nice and slow time to rest the feet for a bit and end what we thought was a fun couple hours :)"}
{"text":"This location is a sweet Get Away that is 20 minutes from the busy Las Vegas Strip. The sky and air is clear filled with stars and only the sounds of the animals and nature fill the air at night. I love the nostalgia of this place. I got a room where the carpet looks like a wood floor and the room is large. It is peaceful and feels like your on a vacation with no one else around. The Old Town is awesome and has stories of ghost hauntings and I love all the animals. Great place to bring your kids for history and entertainment. Everyone is nice here. This is a great place to get away from the city. I live in Hollywood and from Texas so I appreciate this place."}
{"text":"We came to ride horses and chew gum, and we were all out of gum. But seriously folks, the staff who conduct the horse rides are nothing short of awesome. Super friendly, patient, informative, and earnestly want to know if you have any questions. The youngest in our group  had a melt down when it came time to saddle up and it was looking like one of the adults was going to have to hang back but the staff preempted that event before it became an issue. Still not sure how they managed to pull that off but when you have kids, sometimes it is useful to have some third party authority around. The ride itself was breath taking in the foothills of the canyon on federal land literally line of sight of red rock canyon. We saw cacti, desert flora, brush, we saw beautiful colors, canyons, clouds, sky, sand, wild deer, rocks, and petrified trees. It was a wonderful experience and one I highly encourage. Our group of youngins in tow can be a real cantankerous bunch at times and every single one of them had a smile on their face and listed it as one of their fave parts of the trip. If you look online, you can even find a $5 off coupon - http://www.vegas4locals.com/coupons/dining-and-nightlife/bonnie-springs-ranch/  I cannot stress first impressions enough though. Bonnie likes to have you sign up for horse back riding in the bar. Which when you have a group of kids is awkward because they have to be in the dining room while you are in the bar. And they are really strict about this no kids in the bar policy. We had a party of 8 and figured we would grab some apps before the ride. We ended up parking the kids around the fire pit in the restaurant while we did paperwork in the bar. The bar tender with the tatt sleeves came off a bit gruff initially. I am sure it is no picnic for him to have to be responsible for the paperwork AND the bar but I did not make those rules. When you are dropping around $300 you want to feel the love. And he was very particular about how the paper work was filled out and by whom. There's also a whole lot of signing going on, both at the bar, and at the stable. So make sure you allow yourself a sufficient amount of time to navigate that mess. We did not have time to order any food that was significant but I can tell you that both the chili loaded fries and the corn fritters with honey were pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"It was cool to go to and look at all the old buildings. Once we went into the part where all of the animals were it was awful. All the workers looked like they had been on drugs and all of the animals seemed unkept and malnourished. Really depressing conditions for all of the animals."}
{"text":"My review is only for the restaurant!! Omfg!! We waited like 1 hour for a table... Standing ... They don't take names and page you... Then we sit and order and wait OVER 30 mins for our food... My son was starving and fell asleep at the table.... The food was good but we ate so fast we all felt sick and I puked it up in the end... Waste of a $12 burger .... People that were sat after us got food b4 we did... Either the waitress forgot to put our order in or they need to work big time on timing orders... If you plan on going on the day of a car show bring your own food there is NOTHING there but this restaurant... Nothing taste that good to waste 3 hours eating .., we missed the bands playing ... The cars... It was all over once we ate..."}
{"text":"Another great place to ride to!!  Great food. Love the karaoke on Fridays, too!!"}
{"text":"Cute as a button.  A nice little drive, just past the Red Rock Hotel (east of the Strip 12-15 miles).  Bonnie Springs is a little touristy, okay a lot, but I like the drive so very much just getting here (you'll also be passing Red Rock mountains...which is AWESOME and a must-stop!).  In the little itsy-bitsy town, it features a Bates-like motel, a general store, and a petting zoo...but I like to sit at the little restaurant bar and get a nice frosty sarsparella on a hot day.  It would be fun to wear a cowboy hat, a leather vest, chaps, boots, and stir-ups...and talk like a Texan, but thank God just a t-shirt and shorts are welcome on those blistering hot, Vegas summer days.  Most fun would be to get some buds together and dress up like the Village People, but I digress.  PS.  Very kid-friendly."}
{"text":"Old town was whatever and the restaurant ... Maybe we are here at the busy hour, but it was impossible to get help. Food was whatever too. My friend recommended it but will never come back and will def. not recommend it to anyone."}
