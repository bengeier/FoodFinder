{"text":"Have been here twice. The first time great, however this time soso. Asked for my dishes spicy. Not what I received. The chicken in the tiki masala was terrible. I don't think I will be back."}

{"text":"Good food, good price & gr8 customer service..."}
{"text":"Dosa buffet is a disaster, went for the dosa night.  Really crowded with music blaring... used to these kind of establishment... Might not be suitable if you are looking for quiet dinner.  , the starter buffet items are inadequate and they keep constantly running out of cups or items.  Then you have to order dosa,  we ordered only few thought it will be quick and enough... Wrong... Dosa's are small like your palm size with a one spoon of fillings in it (so you might need 10 dosa for one regular dosa) ...and it take 40 mins for them to serve... Now to the taste.  Taste of the dosa and sambar are mediocre nothing to rave about.  Will not go for a dosa night..."}
{"text":"South Charlotte finally has a great option for inexpensive Indian!

Copper is nice for a date night, but the Southern part of town needed a solid Indian option, and Peacock has brought its SF-area menu to fill that void.  

We've eaten in once and done take out once (dinner both times -- have yet to go for lunch).  While both experiences were sloooow and no one is going there for a swanky atmosphere, what Peacock delivers in spades is a legit, diverse menu of authentic food.  And they execute it very well at reasonable (though not bargain) prices."}
{"text":"I like goat biryani at peacock very much ... I have been a fan of it ever since I tasted it at Peacock in Raleigh.. It had the same taste here, that's good but I ended up paying 15+ for the biryani alone..."}
{"text":"Nice place. Enjoyed each and everything. Specially biryani was awesome. Staff was really good and helpful . I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"We enter the restaurant, welcomed by an unprofessional waiter. Everyone's wearing very casual clothing, all of the staff workers. The tables were  un-organized. We were dissatisfied by it's cover, but knew not to judge it yet. The casual waiter took us to our seats and we gave our order. My beer took two people to be reminded, just for me to consume. My son's glass was dirty and the water wasn't looking healthy. Our gobi manchuruian arrived, along with the dry chicken 65. The chicken 65 was horrible and the gobi manchuruian  was bearable. We were ready to leave, but we already ordered and find it quite rude to leave. The dishes arrived and as soon as I asked about having my dosa a little spicy, the questioned and laughed. We ate, our chicken dish was good, the paper dosa was too crispy and unenjoyable. The check was too much, we will not return. I remember all the staff workers standing around the table you checked out, playing on their phones."}
{"text":"This is the worst food which  i had never seen. I felt ashamed infront of my relatives. Ordered boneless biryani but its not a boneless i hope its a tomato soup

The worst food which made me guilty.For this worst  food it took around 45 minutes to wait over and finally the taste is tomato soup. Please dont waste your money by investing in this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for New year' s and they cheated us, all our invoices had extra amounts which they refused to credit back. Food was of substandard quality and lousy service."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was excellent. We did not have the buffet or does night, but just ordered from the dinner menu. Had some vegetable samosas, onion and spinach pekora, chicken curry and chicken tikka masala. All of the food was delicious. It wasn't too crowded which was also nice."}
{"text":"When I first came here it was great. Now, the service is completely gone and the food is terrible. I would highly advise not coming to this place. The food takes too long for simple things and when you ask for anything they don't respond to you."}
{"text":"Was so excited for unlimited Dosa, but was supremely disappointed. The quality of dosa was bad. It came out soggy, they were slow to bring food, and very rude when we asked questions. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience. Just wanted to enjoy different kinds of dosa with there dosa buffet but all we got was soggy dosa with a pinch of filling in it. When asked to one of the management that what quality is this we were told this how buffet quality is. So basically they admitted they are serving bad quality in buffet. The staff was rude and arrogant. Whenever we went towards food buffet they were out of half of the stuff and weren't refilling even after we asked them many times. I will not be going back there and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Worst service and they serve cold food. if you object they argue with you. 
We had very bad experience with them.We all went to dosa night and they serve soggy dosas, when we complaint about dosa they said you should order dosa separately, In dosa buffet you get lower quality of dosas. 
We order wine as well which we never get and staff did't informed us about wine. 
They should improve their services, food quality and staff behavior."}
{"text":"We were here yst for the dosa buffet.... Never seen that anywhere before....
The dosas are pretty small and you would need atlesst 4-5... So try ordering them upfront else you will get the second round 15-20 mins after the first and will feel bored of waiting...

The chutneys, sambhar and kheer were very good.... 
The Gunter dosa is nice and spicy.... The chole one literally has 2 spoons of Chole in it...... And the paneer one is totally bland..... The spinach and cheese however and the chicken tikka ones are really good!"}
{"text":"Be careful. According to the South Charlotte weekly June 10th edition they received a restaurant score of 70.5 from the health department."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to South peacock.. First thing very spacious and comfort, I have to agree... 

They have good food options but I'm very disappointed with the taste.  No salt or spices In any of the items - tandoori, chicken curry , Biryani .. Name any item not tasty.. 

Finally if you are Indian food lover.. Then I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Great Food, Nice casual atmosphere. My wife and I tried this for dinner the other night. There were a few Indian families eating there already, which was a good sign to us. Entree prices were $10-15 each. My wife ordered the Chicken Tikki Masala and I had the Butter Chicken. Both were tasty, though we both agreed the butter chicken was better. Our entrees came out in small pots with just the chicken and sauce, with a side of white rice...very nice presentation. We also ordered a side of Naan to dip in the sauce after we were finished and highly recommend that. We had a side of butter Naan and a side of Garlic Naan and both agreed that the Garlic is good if eaten by itself, but the butter was better for sauce dipping. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant in South Charlotte, located in The Fountains.  

Tuesday is the Dosa (Indian taco) buffet."}
{"text":"Peacock, we gave you one last shot, and you failed. Your sign says open Mondays at 11:30 -- we arrived at 11:45, and you're not even here. We did have a great lunch at DB's tavern a few doors down. Good luck."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday afternoon. The food was great, actually delicious but I just looked at my bill and saw that I was double charged for the appetizers we had. I am very upset at myself for not looking closer at my receipt before paying but if they can do this I will never go to this place again. I am beyond angry at myself now. Check your receipts before paying!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my friends again this week.The food is not at good and service is really bad even they don't ask what spice level etc.They just dump the uncooked meat right away.
They mentioned in menu they have special chicken 65 but if you order that u know \" Burned and colorless chicken 65 taste\"
\" Worst service and bad food\" I will never go again to this place."}
{"text":"It was OK. There are better Indian restaurants in town. Location was Off. Service was off. We have ordered something, they served something else. See I did not know about Health department report. I would not suggest/recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We walked in as they opened for dinner. The waiter was texting while he poured us our water. The wine I wanted they didn't have.. It took 15 minutes to get our bread out. Justin beiber and eminem music videos were blasting.. Incredibly awkward. Especially the waiter singing the songs. BUT- the food WAS very good and authentic. Will definitely be getting it To-Go next time."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week Friday.  They had a buffet and I was skeptical since most indian restaurants water down their food during buffets. To my surprise, the food was super delicious!  All the food had amazing flavor without all the heat. I will definitely go back to this place.  As an FYI buffets are only offered Friday thru Sunday, the other days you have to order a la carte.
Please go and enjoy the food, ambience and great taste!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing South Indian restaurant , both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes are great. If you are someone craving for authentic South Indian food , this is the place. If you want to have thalapakatti style biriyani which is popularly made in south Tamil Nadu , this is absolutely  your destination. We are definitely going to try the Wednesday night unlimited biriyani day. I can now say we found a hang out place for our Friday night biriyani cravings."}
{"text":"Have to agree with most of the reviews as this is just another typical Indian Resturant were everything is just enough to were it passes as Indian. Naan on a buffet got old and chewy. Most dishes were cold so I'm assuming these are left overs from the previous day. Sad when you're at such a prominent location in town."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service. We waited for over 45 minutes and no one came to take our order. We finally had to raise our hands and make noise before we can get some one's attention."}
