{"text":"I'm not a big pizza eater but I LOVE Greek food. I found Spiros a little over priced and average food at best.  I ordered the moussaka for take out which came with potato and side salad and it put me back $27. That seems steep for a dinner for one.
And the moussaka was the worst I've ever had. They do, however, make the best Greek salad ever. 

If you're going for the Greek I would recommend Creatus which is down the street. Their Greek food is so much better and more than half the price."}
{"text":"Spiro Agnew was the 39th Vice President of the US who served under Nixon before being forced to resign because of criminal charges.
While he's long since passed, his rather unfortunate legacy is being carried on by the aptly named Spiro's on 17th Ave.  I'll stop short of calling their prices \"criminal\" - let's just say they're a tad on the outrageous side.  I mean, really, $32.95 for a sampler dip platter?  Or $23.95 for a simple marinated chicken breast with a salad and some potatoes?  Maybe these prices would fly in the heart of downtown Calgary, but not in the 'burbs, man.  Thank goodness they sent out a mailer with their menu on it - they saved me a whole lotta loot!"}
{"text":"Simply the best place for having a delicious meal,service was friendly and perfect. We were there for my daughter birthday and enjoyed everything.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Quiet with good service and big portions. Quality of the food not on par with the price however, solid yet not proportionate to the 25-30$ price point on most entrees"}
{"text":"In terms of pizza, Spiro's is hands down the BEST. I can't say the same of the rest of their menu (good, but not amazing) and the decor which I admittedly like and find cozy and awesome could be considered tacky by others who aren't in the mood. I will continue to return to Spiro's every time I need a great slice of pepperoni and mushroom - so good."}
{"text":"Disappointing and pricey!!!!!. Four of us went to Spiros on a week day. Service was good . Food not so much. I had a pep and mush pizza and my wife had moussaka which was rubbery  . I am sure the pizza ingedients were fresh but you could not tell by eating it. Both my wife and felt like the food was frozen and fresh out of a microwave. No reason to go back there."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER. Have loved every bite every single time. Have had delivery a few times. 
When I ate at the restaurant I had awesome service. Not a single bad thing to say about this restaurant. 
Wouldn't get pizza anywhere else after eating spiros!"}
{"text":"We went to Spiros for boyfriends 26th birthday.  We've been to Spiros before and its always been a good experience. The atmosphere is great and it reminds me of something that would come straight out of Greece. 

Boyfriend ordered the cheese pizza and loved it.. not to doughy and not too stiff. And a lot of cheese, which is his favourite. 

Boyfriends mom ordered the baked spaghetti. It was massive, the bowl itself was almost the size of her head. She ate about 1/4 of it and was full and got it to go. 

I had the steamed noodles and meat sauce. It's most likely just me, because boyfriend and his mom loved what they were having, but I found the meat sauce to be bland and kind of flavourless. There was really no presentation thought going into it as it was just a bunch of noodles on a plate and meat sauce dumped onto it. The garlic bread was hardly garlic bread. Just toast with a small amount of melted garlic butter brushed onto it. I mean if you're going to give garlic bread, do it right, a lot of garlic and a clear amount of butter. 

I didn't say anything because I wasn't paying.. but that's how i felt about it.

We decided not to get dessert as everyone was overly full. 

All in all we had a good time, but next time we go back I will be ordering something else besides the pasta and see where that goes."}
{"text":"Excellent greek salad and pizza.  Each piece is like a meal!!  Fresh ingredients, and Saganaki to die for.  Greek wine is still terrible..."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza (we had the Bebas Lamb) and friendly service. Definitely recommend this place. The patio could use some sprucing up, but it was a pleasant place to be."}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious family run restaurant. Appetizer and salad portions are beyond generous; baked bruschetta is massive and a small greek salad is enough for 2-3 servings. Although their pizzas seem to be a bit expensive at first glade, when it arrives you realize how many toppings are included. The service is quick and the staff are all genuinely nice people. Go here!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza delivery from here. Got a gluten free pizza and it was amazing. Pizza was flavourful, the crust was possibly the best gluten free crust I've ever had. This is totally my new pizza joint."}
{"text":"Just south of Westbrook mall on 33rd street is Sprios PIzza and Spaghetti House. Oh and in case you miss it, it's the restaurant painted in blue and white with the big Greek God statue in front of it. 

Went on a Friday night, and despite the place being busy, the service was excellent, friendly and relatively fast for a small restaurant (the pizza took a little time to cook, but I expect that in a small restaurant). The ambiance and decor was nice. The blue and white color scheme is internal as well and Greek Island pictures of white houses next to the blue sea brought me back to my travels in Greece. The place has that house turned restaurant feel, it felt very intimate and cozy. Traditional and contemporary Greek music plays in the background in low volume allowing for one to have normal conversation without raising one's voice.  Nice place!

I ordered the Anjelika Greek Style pizza. It came deep dish style with the thick crust. It was ok, but I expected more. My sense was that the toppings tasted a little watery, the sauce felt a little bland and the dough tasted more salty than sweet.  The price felt high as well.  A large 12' was $27.15.  Perhaps that is why I expected more.  

I would take a date here because its a good intimate setting for some nice one on one conversation.  Might try something else besides the pizza next time."}
{"text":"I found this place quite by accident, and was very happy with everything from the food to the service. I had the chicken souvlaki with a feta spinach and artichoke dip to start. Easily the best meal of my month.

I will return  for sure, and I hope you try it too!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in decades! (Used to visit a lot in high school - but we only ever ate the pizzas back then :-)  

Four of us decided to have dinner here on Sunday. We made a reservation and were seated in a lovely booth by the window.  You would be able to guess by the d√©cor that you are in a Greek restaurant. It has a sunny Mediterranean style that is very welcoming (lots of blue).

One thing that took away from the atmosphere was a blue napkin that was placed diagonally on the table as a centre piece. It was stained and looked like it had never been washed - smelled bad too. Off the table it went and we were set to order. 

We shared DIMITRI'S PLATTER. It started with a small Greek salad that was only so-so. I don't know about you, but I like cucumbers in my Greek salad and there were none in this one. But on to the platter! There was moussaka, 2 beef souvlaki, spanokopita, 4 lamb chops, Greek ribs and both rice and lemon roast potatoes. Every thing was nicely spiced and very tasty. My favourites were the spanakopita and Greek ribs - yum yum yum.  Spiros calls it a spectacular feast fit for the gods, and they come very close. The only drawback was the lamb chops.  By the time we got to them they had cooled off and lamb tastes best piping hot! We solved that little problem by taking them home and heating them up for lunch the next day - delish. All in all a good deal for $98 - especially if you've never eaten Greek and want to try a little bit of everything.

We finished up with some coffee and shared a Baklava and Kataifi for dessert. Both are made from Phyllo pastry with walnuts almonds, cinnamon and honey. One is layered and the other is rolled and both were perfection!

The service was cheerful, friendly and prompt.

I think I'll be back - gotta try one of those pizzas that Spiros is known for."}
{"text":"Food was delish (we had a pizza) but I found the prices REALLY high. When some of the entrees went by, I could see that many had large portions but if everyone in my family ordered something different we would be well over $150 without appetizers or alcohol (incl tax & one soda per). 

Music is WAY LOUD and makes it almost impossible to talk. My 5 yr old loved it, though, and chair danced his way through the evening."}
{"text":"Good food, nice Greek food, great pizza.

You should totally get their food, pizza with meat sauce is Oh my God Delicious."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff. Love the garlic toast too. Well served drinks. The only thing they should do in my opinion is spend a little money on new decor. It is just too tacky and dated. Some parts of the restaurant look almost dingy and dirty. Aside the atmosphere is cozy. The prices are reasonable and the pizza is well served without being soggy, as they have a special metal sheet underneath it to prevent to much humidity accumulating."}
{"text":"I think their pizza is fabulous, too bad it costs an arm and a leg to buy it. We bought two extra large pizzas and it was $75. One time I made an organic pizza from scratch that cost $90, but that was a bit insane. I would give this restaurant a higher rating if the prices were more reasonable."}
{"text":"May try this one again for dine-in. Appears family run - this I like. Sopranos style.
We got our pie from here for take out (veg, my fave) and we could not eat it nice and piping hot so that may have affected the overall taste. For me though, a good pizza should be good eaten cold, warm, hot.
It is a thick Greek crust, an option was not given and we just went with what was offered. The crust is buttery and fresh but I think I will stick with Famoso Italian style thin crust if given a choice. 
The toppings were good, thank God, no canned mushrooms here.
The cheese was ok... I wish there had been a bit more sauce, I liked the tanginess of it. Nothing worse than bland tomato sauce in my books!
The price - a small pizza was $19!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT? 
6 pieces, a little larger than other small pizzas I have seen but still seems a bit high with no additions or alterations even by Calgary standards.
Open til midnight Fri and Sat, last order has to be in by 1140pm."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

After a friend's recommendation, Spiros is the place to go for some great pizza. The crust is thick and filled with tons of meat and cheese (kind of like a deep dish pizza). The price for a pizza is definitely more than your average pizza, but the quality of it is well worth the money. No wonder tons of people come for their pizza. If you love lots of meat, i suggest getting the 'extra special pizza' or the 'spiros special' which has a thick layer of meat covered with cheese. 

The exception though is the one topping pizzas like the black olives my bf got, which was too expensive for just one topping and he got sick of eating it after 3 slices (their smallest size of pizza is definitely enough to share with someone).

As for the Greek food, I tried their Moussaka entree (alternate layers of Potatoes, Zucchini, Eggplant, and Spiced Ground Beef topped with Bechamel Sauce) that came with vegetable and potatoes. The moussaka didn't really live up to its delicious description and was pretty expensive like most of their other Greek dishes. 

The place is really small and crowded- can get pretty hot when it's crowded. It's nothing too fancy, a lot of odds and ends that are hung up on the wall, but I could tell there were a lot of patrons to the restaurant. 

Overall, I wouldn't come here for anything other than the pizza; everything else is expensive and not worth the price. If you do come here to eat the pizza, I suggest you go with a group of friends because you cannot finish one on your own and you might want to try at least two types so you don't get sick of eating one. So if you love thick crust pizzas, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Some months ago we were looking for a great Greek restaurant that carried forward the Greek tradition of spices, quality and quantity. Once one has had great Greek, the benchmark is set.
The first time at Spiros, we were pleased, but not wow'd. Second time, just not that great. Thinking we'd hit a bad night, we tried it again: was so poor that just couldn't consider returning.
The flavours over the course of checking out 6 different mains were just not there. Although the lamb, potatoes and other flavours touched on the use of Greek spices, we left bored. Again, perhaps they've tamed down the menu to please the palates of Canadians, but certainly foodies in the know will be disappointed.
Want great Greek?
Drive to Cochrane to a little home venue, My Greek Plate, and enjoy a dining experience that should wow you. Or check out Broken Plate in Willow Park, as I've heard that it's good.
Skip the dishes at Spiros!"}
{"text":"Great pizzas!!!! Greek salad is very good delivery is sometimes slow and pizza suffers because of it."}
{"text":"Not sure why the mad love for this restaurant.  I have only been in Calgary 8 months and I have already eaten better Greek-style pizza at Matador Pizza and better Greek food at Calypso Taverna. And did I mention that the prices at the other, better restaurants were significantly cheaper? If the ambiance at Spiros was really beautiful and the service outstanding then there might be some justification for the expensive pricing, but neither was the case. My first and last trip here."}
{"text":"Great tasting lasagne but not worth $40 for 2 orders of it. Didn't like dinning in as customer service was always flaky. It's way too overpriced for what you get. Will be going elsewhere for pasta."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza in town! And a wonderful family owned restaurant!! Still have memories of this place as a kid!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Spiros multiple times the first experience was during their dinner time rush, and the seating was inconsequently located near the door (during winter= drafts).

For some odd reason when I think of Greek food, the film \"My big fat Greek Wedding\" instantly comes to mind with dancing Yorba's, Tacky d√©cor from the early 90's and plenty of foe plants and grape vines on the wall.  Comically Spiros has all those stereotypes.

The family owned and run establishment includes daughters, nieces, granddaughters and cousins serving the patrons their dishes, meanwhile the head of the family dealt with the kitchen staff.... it felt like I was in a bad comedy. Any moment the cameras would appear... but no just my highly anticipated  Chicken Parmigiana and Home made Greek style Caesar salad instead. That I might add was delicious...I returned the plate empty (a compliment to the staff and traditional family recipe) the downside of coarse was waiting for the actual meal to arrive!

The busy flow of hungry people. And not having a fork proved to be challenging to get a waitress' attention. Finally I walked to the kitchen (disrupting there flow) and got myself a fork. Only to notice my waitress was getting yelled at for not \"doing her job\". It was brutal and guilt seemed to slip in... I couldn't help but feel blamed in some way for this confrontation. 


After a month I came again, because not all first impression are correct. Heck I've been known to flub and later prove I'm worthy of my job or being apart of something... Anywho I got the same waitress, it appears I made an impression on her, that or she's got an incredible memory.. Anywho I ordered the same thing.

I always search the menu then order that same thing meal, this time the waiting was cut in 1/2 and my meal was delicious, had the same consistency in flavour. I was impressed. However that was the 1 and only time I had great service. Since then I ONLY order out or do take way. Because the first impression was/ is what the place is like 24/7. Except on freak days. I might also add the parking is ridiculous... good luck finding a spot.

Unfortunately now that I have been diagnosed with Celiac s disease my choices have been limited."}
{"text":"Let's just be clear , I really enjoy Spiros but I will not be going back . I have been a customer for many years ( but not a regular ) . We started with a tasty Caesar salad that was good ,but had too much dressing and some yummy calamari that was perfectly cooked.  Then we had  2 awesome pizzas . I had a ice tea and one other in my party did as well plus what I thought was a refill each .When the bill came I was charged for 4 drinks . I asked the ( hostess ) when paying my bill why refills where not free . She stated that we had 4 drinks and they don't have free refills . Then she proceeded to inform me \" that our regular customers know of our drink policy \" which to me was more or less F off .... I realize that businesses are in business to make money but to pay $12 for  2 drinks and 2 refills of watered down fountain pop in a medium
sized glass is pushing it . They made there money on $22 pizzas ,don't take advantage of me ... Guess I wasn't a regular but now I'm not a customer at all ! Thanks for inspiring me to write a review after lurking all this time ! Service was great too :D"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA in Calgary!  Their staff is one of the most friendly Group of people I've ever met. I been more than once, probably been going for nine years! It's a must try. their  other dishes are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Maybe my new standard for Greek food in this city.  

This is a recent discovery suggest by a friend when I dismissed Boston Pizza for dinner. I'm super glad I was \"being difficult\" this evening but I'm not sure how this became second choice to any one behind BPs.  Ahem. 

I've had flambeed cheese in greek restaurants before but Spiros does it best.  The spanakopita was alright but really needed to be served with some tzatziki or something as it was just very dry. The spreads and pita were nice,  I ate the feta and chili one and it was very pleasant.   I stole some roasted veggies off the plate of my fiance and I just love them.    The village salad was great and I'm not a big salad person.  Probably my favorite (so far) was the lasagna with tomato sauce  -  I'm just in love with that sauce and it made the dish very good.   I rarely love pasta but this was great stuff and I would order it again. 

Not cheap but it doesn't need to be because they will remain consistently busy like i've observed in the late evenings on weeknights when almost nothing else still brings in crowds. 

Still haven't had the pizza but from the sounds of it.... that's my next trip!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. You are either going to love it here or think you have gone back to a Jackie Gleason re-run. The decor will knock you back about 35 years. The service is excellent. The servers are small town friendly and down-to-earth. You won't find any Earl-esque type black minis and those to fill them. The food is very good. I had the pizza and it was generous and tasty, The prices will also knock you back into next week. But it is all good fun. If you are looking for retro decor with great food at pretty high prices, then drop in. It was a lot of fun and a welcome break from the chains i.e.. Moxies, Montanas, Earls, Etc."}
{"text":"Food:  The greek salad is good.  The calamari is a bit chewy.
Price:  High compared to 2 other greek restaurants I go to.
The disappointment was trying to fight off the fly that was landing in our food.  The waitress said thats what happens when you keep the door open."}
{"text":"I've been to Spiros several times now, and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. I'll get right to the point: the Italians may have invented pizza, but the Greeks also know how to make it in their own style, and Spiros hasn't been in business over 20 years for nothing. Some of the best calamari and thick crust pizza I've ever had anywhere. Definitely going back again and again, not just for the cozy, friendly atmosphere, but for the pizza...oh, the pizza!"}
{"text":"Very good Greek salad and delicious pizza, almost like a deep dish pizza, even 10 inch is a lot. Salmon is also pretty good. Moussaka is good but not a personal fan of it."}
{"text":"anytime a resto has its own parking, it's extra star for me, esp. for a tourist lol. but does show they care for their customers and no need to look for parking.

Lamb soulvaki really tasty and tender, great portion and value...not as spacious as some but good service, twice refilled my hot water."}
{"text":"Another great neighbourhood gem. Hearty meals and take-out! Italian, Greek, it's all good. Big portions so go hungry."}
{"text":"Between Red Carpet & Spiro's I choose these guys. Gluten free & wheat crust. Vegetarian pizza is AMAZING. Makes me miss \"Martini's\" in Vancouver just a little less. They deliver, the staff is nice and the service is fast. 

Good food, good prices, this is THE PLACE for pizza in YYC."}
{"text":"Friday night is pizza night, ordered in many time always steady, better than any chain in town good pick for pie"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years when we feel like awesome Greek food. There Pizza is the best ever, or the Slovakia plates. They are often busy Friday and Saturday nights, smaller seating arrangements so I'd make a reservation - but this place is well worth the wait. Staff are always friendly; food is always fantastic!!"}
{"text":"5 of us ate here Oct 13 2017 for my wife's birthday, amazing service at this very friendly family run place!!! Katarina was a great host, they genuinely care about their patrons.  Very warm atmosphere, owner came out to make sure everything was to our liking, which it was, it exceeded our expectations... absolutely.  We all shared a couple of lamb dishes along with 4 half pizzas, we were so full and had plenty left over for lunch the next day.  Needless to say I surely will be returning to Spiros!!"}
{"text":"The flamb√©ed  Greek cheese is great!! I really liked this appetizer!! The pizzas are very good too... I wouldn't say they are the best pizzas in Calgary, but they are good... I would definitely go back just for the appetizer!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Spiro's yesterday for lunch.  We were the first ones at the restaurant and there was a steady flow of people after we got there.  We ordered the IOANNIS SPECIAL - Succulent pulled lamb, garlic, tomatoes, onions & feta cheese - so garlicky and so delicious.  Parmesan cheese and chili flakes come automatically to the table without me having to request for them.  I like that!  We also ordered the Lamb Meatloaf plate; came with mashed potato, gravy and some steamed vege-carrot and zucchini.  All were great!  Fantastic wait service.  Will be back.  I want to try the Lamb Kleftiko."}
{"text":"Our wedding anniversary was last night and we were recommended this place from two different friends. Having lived on the Danforth in Toronto, we live for Greek food and have tried many hole in the wall places as well as fine dining. 

 My first impression of the restaurant was a small hole in the wall place. I thought to myself, fantastic! This is going to be good food. Then we got the menus. They are very expensive. Very very expensive for what they have to offer. The restaurant seemed dirty. The tables were very small, almost impossible for two to eat. We were in breathing space of other customers. The table cloths looked like they were from the 80's and had the stains to prove it. The place hadn't been updated since they opened. Which isn't a bad thing but the prices should reflect the restaurant. When you pay $25 for a single dish, I expect the quality that comes with it. 

 We got two alcohol drinks, an appetizer( $3 for a single pita added to that)  and two chicken souvlaki dinners plus a coffee and dessert. All in all it came out to over $100. You could go to the keg much cheaper and get larger portions. 

The appetizer was saganaki which was pretty expensive and then we had to pay an extra $3 for a single pita. The Greek salad came and it was the best part of the meal, although very small. Served on a tiny plate. Then the chicken dinners came. Two tiny chicken skewers, 3 half potatoes wedges and 3 pieces of carrots with a slice of zucchini. We weren't fans of the flavors. The potatoes and chicken were just okay. The carrots and zucchini were just steamed, no flavor. 

 For dessert I had the baklava and my husband had a coffee. He thought the coffee was good. The baklava was good too but for $8 it was a tiny tiny piece. 

 The service was good. But we were so cramped that we couldn't enjoy our own conversation and had to listen to both parties on either side. Which was American politics. That's what you want to hear on your wedding anniversary! We were happy to support a local business but we won't be going back."}
