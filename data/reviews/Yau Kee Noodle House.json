{"text":"Yau Kee Noodle House is located in the same plaza as T&T Supermarket Middlefield location. 

Its concept is similar to Jim Chai Kee. There are more selections though in what you can have in your noodle e.g. wonton, dumplings, fish balls, beef brisket, pig feet, beef intestine... All the offerings are written in Chinese on the wall.... There are no real menus. I wondering if one cannot read Chinese will they have an English menu?

I decided on wonton/fishballs with rice noodles ($5.00), which is the usual I order at Jim Chai Kee. I have to say the noodle is much better than the one that serve at Jim Chai Kee. The kitchen really took the time to prepare my noodle, so it was not as quick as JCK. However, the fishballs are way tastier, with onion/parsley/dried shrimps mixed in with the minced fish. The fish balls does have a lot of flavour and have no fishy tastes at all. The wontons were made with all shrimps. the  shrimps were fresh and tasty! The rice noodle were cut into narrower strips and by doing so is more inline with the fresh pho noodle. Yes it is really tasty! 

The chilli oil is made by the store. It is not too spicy but has great fragrance. You can buy it for $5 a jar. 

I would definitely be back to try out other item on the menu. The price is reasonable with single item with noodle for $4.50.

This is a family runned and owned business, so service though friendly but sometimes can be a little slower.

Cash only!"}
