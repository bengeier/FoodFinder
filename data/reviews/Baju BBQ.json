{"text":"Ooooph. I really wanted to like this place but man was it disappointing. Came here on a Saturday night with my better half and we ordered one each of the brisket and pulled pork sandwich so we could try both. The pulled pork was quite good. Nice flavor and you didn't need sauce to make it work. The brisket was awful. I'm pretty sure my two year old slippers (without sauce) would be more flavorful than that. 

The sides: We ordered one each of the collared greens and 'mac 'n cheese' The greens had zero seasoning it seemed. Collared greens are bitter and love salt. How you can't use any is baffling. The mac and cheese was, wait for it.....penne! Yes they used penne (saw it in the frying pan when I walked past the kitchen and thought \"There is no way that is the mac and cheese\" I was wrong. There was literally no cheese on it which as far as I know is an integral part of the dish. I asked the server if that was normal and he said no we usually use another kind. Well good thing they had the other kind in stock less than an hour after opening! The worst I've ever had by far and I told him as much. He apologized but didn't comp it or suggest something else. 

Like I said I was looking forward to it since Jason Rees is involved but he needs to review the standards and get it up to par because there is no way the place is surviving putting out product like that especially with all the bbq competition out there. My friend swears by their ribs and maybe I will go back to try them but it's going to take awhile to get the taste(less) brisket off my palette."}
{"text":"I was really hyped up for this place. I went with my friend for my birthday. We were both excited to finally have a bbq place here in Toronto to go to. Well this was a huge epic fail. I will not return to this place. The vibe when we entered after climbing the wall of stairs to get there, was not the best at all. There was no hello please sit where you like. We were snubbed as soon as we walked in the door.  Drinks took longer to come than the food. We order the pig out. Huge disappointment. The platter could easily feed one person let alone two. The food seemed like it was frozen packages of food deep fried and tossed in a smoke seasoning. The food was cold. The hush puppies that were on the platter were not cooked all the way through, still doughy in the middle. All the meat was dry and tasteless. We didn't finish the food. Lost out appetites fast. And the server was puzzled when we said we didn't want to take the left overs home."}
{"text":"Walking up the stairs of the Monarch Tavern, turning the corner and into Baju, I immediately got an awesome vibe. A real local, neighborhood hangout with regulars sitting at the bar. Completely unpretentious, groups sitting along picnic tables, chatting away with a few pints and several bites. Baju is new but the bar is untouched by time and the pinball machine helps.  

The beer here is impressive especially those on draft like the GLB Karma Citra IPA and several others.   

The menu is equally awesome with 5 BBQ meats and sides galore to choose from. Some sides sound like mains like the pork wings, burnt ends and moink balls, so you can technically have meat mains with meat sides (I'm not judging, I thought of it). The variety is really great and the Pig out Platter makes sense if you want to try several things out and have at least one other person to share with.

With 3 others, we opted to go with the Pig out Platter $42 (3 meats, 4 sides) and 2 half orders of the other meats (8-9$/each) so we could have all meat options altogether because, why the hell not.

What I recommend:

St. Louis Cut Spare Ribs (smokey, spice rub is slightly sweet and flavorful, meat is tender, not 'Fall-off-the-bone-status' but great anyways)       

Smoked Chicken Thigh (smokey, very tender, flavorful)

Beef Brisket (smokey, flakey, a tad dry but very good with homemade sauces)

Curry Potato Salad 

Collard Greens

(missed the burnt ends but I bet those are bomb)

Honorable Mention:
Moink Balls because they are friggin meatballs wrapped in bacon... 

Overall, I really liked everything about Baju. The prices are good, the service I got was really caring and patient, the beers are great, the food is comparable to the best BBQ in T.O. and the neighborhood is super chill. I will go back very  soon."}
{"text":"Based on the previous reviews here , I would say consistancy is the main challenge.
I am a Certified KCBS BBQ Judge, and Jason Rees is well known and highly regarded in the Canadian BBQ world.
We ordered the Meat Tornado, which was a sampler of 6 kinds of BBQ meats.
Here is my rundown in order of preference.
Brisket is normally the toughest cut to get right. Here Baju nails it. Nice bark, thick, moist and juicy. One of the best in the city. He has used the point / dreckle, which is moister than the flat.
Chicken Thigh, close to competition quality,  moist tender , with bite through skin 
Pork Belly: Large piece of pork belly, fairly tender, nice flavour, not cured
Things go downhill from there:
Pulled Pork. Dry small shreds, sevicable with thier outstanding Carolina Gold sauce.
Ribs: great to see them use St Louis vs Baby Backs, but not meaty at all ( supplier issue?) and dry. Would have liked to see some sauce brushed on them
Wings: Tender but with an off putting flavour, Burnt Paprika?"}
{"text":"Located within the upstairs of the Monarch Tavern, I was intrigued into Baju because Jason Rees of the Pork Ninjas has been running shop since Caplansky bowed out. I tried Pork Ninjas pulled pork a few years back at the Depanneur on College Street, and it was fantastic, so decided to see what the deal was here. 

First, lets talk beer though. The Monarch Tavern has what could likely be the best craft beer selection in the Little Italy area. A lovely selection of options across all flavours and beer types, served in proper 20oz pint glasses.

On to the food. The first thing I tried was the Curry Potato Salad and I was thinking to myself how it was an interesting flavour combination and we were off to a good start. The ribs were also decent, and they have a variety of sauces at the table to work with in adding additional flavours. I'd say that the Kansas City BBQ sauce was the best. French fries were good too. But then after those items things went downhill. The smoked wings were actually insanely smokey. Like distractingly smokey to be lacking in actual chicken flavour. The Moink Balls (bacon wrapped meatballs) were extremely salty. And the weird thing was it wasnt the bacon that made them salty - the actual beef meatballs were the flawed item. Lastly, the pickle chips were just plain bad. 

Despite the hit and miss nature of the food, I'd say the portions were adequate in size... So we left with full bellies, a nice buzz from the delicious beer selection, and not a huge dent in the wallet. So I'd be hard pressed to not give this place the 3 star review."}
{"text":"Dry flavorless meat. You have to pay extra for BBQ Sauce since. Not smoked."}
{"text":"My friend and I had high hopes for this place. We read the menu before hand and everything sounded really good. We ordered the pig out platter so that we could try a little bit of everything (safe to say we didn't finish it). 

Issues right off the bat, we walked in and it took several minutes to be greeted even though the place was basically empty. When our drinks arrived to our table, my glass had a bright pink lipstick mark on it. I had also ordered wine, which was served in a drink glass (not a huge deal, but it's a little too \"rustic\" for me)

We ordered the following on our platter:

Pork Belly - AWFUL. Soggy, undercooked, bland
Spare Ribs - Probably the best thing we had, but nothing special. I've made better.
Chicken Thighs - skin should have been crispy, way too fatty, spices weren't anything amazing
French Fries - Standard fresh cut fries, nothing special but better than most of what we had
Moink Balls - Surprisingly good. Would order those again if I ever went back (which is highly unlikely to happen, EVER)
Pulled pork kimchi egg rolls - Not good. At all. Not enough pulled pork, way too much breading. These were suggested by our server, not sure why....
Mac n Cheese - Cannot call that mac and cheese. Pasta was very underdone, and the \"velvety smooth, rich, cheezy cream sauce\" was in fact a watery, tasteless drizzle of nothing. 

The promise of good flavors and authentic BBQ was definitely NOT what we got. 

We also went with a coupon from Buytopia, and even with the discount, it wasn't worth what we paid. 

With all of the amazing restaurants to choose from in this city, this is one to avoid completely."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork, juicy and flavourful with the perfect amount of smoke.

Brisket was a bit dry but otherwise good.

Was impressed that the collard greens were made on order but would have been better if they cooked longer, the bacon was the best part of that side.

Beans were a bit firm, cornbread was decent.

A great takeout meal for two at a decent price, we will order again."}
{"text":"Great in theory, but the food is mediocre at best. 

We got the platter for 2. Flavours were good, but brisket was really dry and ribs were cold (odd). Beans and greens were great. Mac and cheese was meh. Fries were great, but they should be anywhere. 

Good beer selection!"}
