{"text":"\"F\" Pete's!!! Eds is the best Nathaniel made our mushrooms bomb as \"F\" love it!!! Fish and chips are always made fresh there not sitting there waiting for someone to order up me and the wife miss the west phx location but so good we willing to travel jus to eat here"}
{"text":"Ed's Fish and Chips is a great little Avondale/Goodyear gem.   It's in the older part of Avondale, but is worth the trip down Central Ave.  The fish is amazing, especially when you dip it in the delicious red sauce.  It's slightly spicy and adds the right amount of tang to compliment the fish.  The chicken plate is really good, also.  It's a nice-sized breast piece battered and fried to a nice brown crust.   They have tons of fried veggies, such as zucchini, cauliflower, mushrooms and onion rings. The fries are the fatter fries, not quite steak fries, but still big fluffy fries.  They also have various breaded seafood, like shrimp and scallops.  After you've been there a few times, don't be surprised if you're greeted by name the next time you come in!"}
{"text":"Like Thom below, I dont like giving bad reviews either, but you have to be warned. Going to give this place two stars, because the gal behind the counter was very nice. Even gave me a free sample of deep fried oyster. The place was clean and comfortable for what it is.  On the other hand, I had better fish from Gorton's. Yes, the frozen kind you get in the grocery store. Also ordered shrimp. Looked good, but it was 50-60% breading. Maybe the burgers or sandwiches are better but I'll never know. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been coming to Ed's for awhile, I've never been disappointed yet! We are greeted as we come in.. Ok, we come often, but we are not on a first name basis. 
Service is friendly, yes it's not a fancy dinning area. I kinda like the nautical seat covers and it was cool inside on a 110 day. 
The place is clean, kitchen is clutter free and you can see them cooking as you wait. Fish and chips are piping hot and the chips are freshly made not greasy or see thro with grease, but perfect!
The fish is square yes, but it's crispy and breaded served hot.. So that I start with the chips first. One day I would love to try the shrimp or something else, but I'm happy with my order and the cool people who work here. BTW one of the cooks reminds me of Josh Harris from Deadliest Catch, just sayin..."}
{"text":"Just finished my lunch @ Ed's. Normally I don't like to write a bad review but I think this is one that needs to be out there. The place was clean the staff friend and the service good. That being said when my order of fish and chips was delivered to my table I saw what looked like 2 frozen style fish sticks. They were crispy that is to say overdone. I'm glad I only ordered the two piece because it wasn't worth finishing . 
I have been looking for a good Fish and Chip place in the SW valley and as of now the search will continue . Sorry but as much as I wanted good F & C's this wasn't it."}
{"text":"So long Pete's....Hello Ed's!!! This place is what I Remember back in tha day! Definitely a must."}
{"text":"This place was awful!! We ordered fish and chips with shrimp thinking we'd get the good fried fish meal we were craving. Well were given square patties that we could have gotten from the grocery store in the frozen section and long pieces of overly battered things that they tried to pass off as shrimp....only about 30% of that thing was shrimp. It came with hot sauce, ketchup was free, but tarter sauce (which I believe normally comes when fish is ordered) costs extra. My boyfriend had been the one who really wanted fish and the place we were going to go to was closed so we went to the nearest spot ignoring the number of stars. Needless to say he was very pissed off and the only thing that kept us there was the fact that we had already paid. Never going again and if there was a way to give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"I have to give fours stars based on the food and prompt service by staff. I have been going here since they first reopened and never had a problem other than once when I called in and placed an order and went to pick it up they had no idea about it. The place itself is in dire need of a makeover and I am sure because of that it keeps a lot of customers away. The food is just like Pete's fish n chips only bigger and better. Huge deep fried zucchini strips, humongous deep fried shrimp and tasty burgers. If you don't mind an old run down restaurant (they keep it clean though) then I would recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I gave them 2 stars only because the food was okay. They are very stingy with their sauces, you get one with your meal if you get three pieces of fish you get one red sauce and you can trade that in for a tartar sauce.If you eat in  they will refill them at no charge. Otherwise it is $0.27 per sauce. There is no salt  or pepper on the table or ketchup , I did not ask for any ketchup so I don't know if there was a charge. This was my first time here but I don't think I'll be back I'm all for food waste but nickel-and-diming me is kind of petty. I'm off for the small business owner but customers do have to be considered as well. I hope up by adding up all the extra charges they will be able to last another generation."}
{"text":"Been eating here since 96ish The battered shrimp and submarine cheeseburger sandwich is my go to meal. Hey Scott, long time buddy. GO CARDS!!"}
{"text":"Went today, the other fish and chip was closed on Labor Day! Not a fancy place, but don't care as long as it looked clean, and it did! Young lady at counter was helpful and friendly! Now on another note, the food! Even though fish is frozen squares deep fried it was tasty!  We asked what type the fish was and she said cod! I really like catfish but since we went for fish and chips wanted to see how good it was! But the shrimp was large but all batter! Never seen shrimp look like that, didn't have much flavor! No salt on anything but I actually like that, but no salt on table, but tiny packets were available! Tartar sauce was good, I'm picky about that! Not sure I will return anytime soon because it was quite ordinary but I must say everything was hot, and that's always a plus in my book! And I must note this was my first time here!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty \"meh\" spot if you're looking for good fried fish. Too much batter, not enough fish. The sauce they serve it with is good. Maybe I'll try something different next time, they have fish, shrimp, and scallops."}
{"text":"Shrimp is WAAAYYY better than Petes! Sauce is also tastier than Petes. Fish is not too bad prices are about the same. The only concern I have is that I was here the other night to (catch) me some late night grub and when I pulled up there were 2 employees smoking right outside like literally less than 8feet from door violation one!. Then they come inside and get back to work violation two! No one washed there hands strike three!. Then another employee was puffing it up outside then he comes inside and starts working strike 4 . Then you have girlfriend in the front puffing on an e cig, that's classic. I get that it was late almost about to close however until closing you should still maintain a healthy & professional environment for the sake of everyone else. Staff was still very friendly even though they are smokers."}
{"text":"It might not look like much from the outside. 

If you are expecting fine dining, Ed's definitely isn't the place but if you crave some good casual food at affordable prices this is the place

Ed's Fish and Chips  doesn't look like much much from the outside, just a little hole in the wall.  However, if you like fish & chips, shrimp & chips  you should give Ed's a try.  

Ed's is budget-friendly.  The fish are cake-shaped and fried to a deep golden brown.  Ed's makes their own \"sauce\" for the fish and chips daily, and the sauce is tasty so you won't need  any other condiments.  

I was surprised at the quality of the fish, its crispiness, and its flavor. I have to admit the sauce is addictive; I'm not sure what's in the Red Sauce, but you just keep dipping the fish in for more.

The food is  served piping hot and seasoned just right. Good food, affordable prices, and great customer service.  What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Every time,  yummy! We've been coming here for years.  Veggie combo is perfect.  Their red sauce is delicious, we always order extra. Fries need salt ;-),  but so good. Fish is always deep fried just right! Love coming here, always satisfies the cravings."}
{"text":"Oh my Ed's Fish N' Chips, you sure are cookin' up some tasty seafood! Your quality of food is comparable to some higher priced restaurants. Yippy!  I've had the oysters, the fish sandwich, and the fish and chips, and everything was delicious. (Really it was!) They make their own sauces too.  The building in is a little older, but the restaurant is clean.  The service has always been very friendly.  Check it out! 

Good seafood, friendly service, prices, clean."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food quality because we did not make it past the ordering. My wife and I walked in for the first time ever and the first thing my wife said is the air conditioning off? the young man happily said \" We don't turn on the air conditioning  during the summer because it cost's too much\". With that my wife said, and I agree \" We are not eating here and turned around and left. As we where walking out the door the young man said \" have a nice day!\". I don't care if the food is FREE we are not spending our money in a place that doesn't cater to there customers needs by at least turning on the air conditioning. I can't help but wonder what else they are cutting corners on because \" it costs too much\"."}
{"text":"Not enough shrimp for the amount of batter/ breads. Pls remember to always sprinkle some salt! My shrimp was tasteless!"}
{"text":"Sunday Mother in law wanted fish and she wanted the catfish at Flavors of Louisiana, but they were closed on Sundays. Used yelp to find a Fish and Chips and Ed's came up. It's the closest and thought I would give it a try. 

The young man tending the register was very polite and attentive. The others cooking seemed like something was bothering them or having a bad day without a smile or saying hello to customers who are keeping them employed. 

I'll give 5 stars for the great customer service of the young man, and i would give no stars to one of  cooks who needs to work on true customer service, quality, and price of the food. 

The food is over priced and the quality is not very good."}
{"text":"I go there pretty often. I love it. Penny is there pretty often and is always in smiles. For a fried place it's really good. I recommend this place to all that ask for a great hole in the wall. I have been going there since forever and it's better now than I've ever remembered. Will always recommend"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. Can't say much about the customer service but the food is a guilty pleasure. The tartar sauce is amazing and I love the veggie platter."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of eds and the one on 51st closed from what I hear. We came here cause my husband has been craving it. So far when we walk in the air cond is on... the service is great. They have thursday night special 10 percent off all combos and kids meal deals. There is thursday night karaoke. Nice to get together with family here on thursdays. This location on central seems clean. You can actually see the cooks getting their cook on in kitchen. I will update on food when I try it."}
{"text":"Eds is great the sauce is thicker than Petes. 
Kids love the chicken nuggets from eds."}
{"text":"So we had been craving fish and chips for quite a long time before we finally stumbled upon Ed's almost by accident. It is literally right around the corner from where I live but the outside of the building is so....plain?...that it just looked like some random store front. But I had seen the sign a few dozen times and decided to look it up online. The reviews aren't great , but few were outright bad so we decided we had to see for ourselves.

As far as atmosphere..its much better once you get inside, it's seems like a neighborhood mom and pop place, and it is! The family history is on display in the many pictures on the wall of the dining room.  The food....they have alot to choose from. We went with fish and chips and mixed fried veggies.  The fish comes in squares..that made me nervous...it certainly isnt a fresh fillet..I'm guess it all comes frozen...but it wasn't bad to eat...the veggies were way over battered but I enjoyed the cauliflower. I will go back .... maybe... but I am going to look for some fresher fish first.....the pictures on the yelp page make it seem like it is long fried fillets...but oddly only the shrimp comes in those long strips...the shrimp was all batter...we couldn't taste any shrimp in there.

Sorry guys! The staff already looked angry when we came in...this won't cheer them up any."}
{"text":"They are one of the only mom/pop place that offer a fish and chip/fried foods in the area and that is still open.  We use to go here more often, but the neighborhood is not the best, the restaurant is old, dated, and bearly above a level of being allowed to operate (needs a lot TLC)  now don't get me wrong i love hole in the wall places, but i just don't feel safe going their.  

Prices have risen and quantity (size of fish/chip) has decrease. We took our order to go but was still hungry after eating.   I will go back, its just not one of those place that make me want to go back to.  See you in a few years (if they are still open)"}
{"text":"I was really surprised at the quality of food here! The prices are unbeatable too! 

Most people would brush this place off as a Pete's knock off, but the truth is, this place is just better. They take credit cards, so they've got that going for them too!

The shrimps are delicious, and actually have shrimp in the seasoned batter. The steak sandwich is basically a chicken fried steak sandwich and it's well seasoned, moist, and delicious, if you don't like mustard tell them to hold it. 

I also had the two burger combo. These are not sliders! They are bigger than a McBurger, and a heck of a lot tastier! Under $5.00 too! 

Best thing was the fried cauliflower. It wasn't greasy, just lightly fried, and delicious. 

Inside: The place is huge, and the people are nice. It's a \"mom & pop\" type place, so you know it's bare bones on the inside, with a big area, extra parking in the rear, and even a little arcade section with the kids, that has X-Men vs Street Fighter!"}
{"text":"I paid $27 for 8 fish and chips, cole slaw and hush puppies.  I was very disappointed.  Fish was square patty,  cole slaw taste terriable, KFC's taste much better.  4 tiny tiny hush puppies are $1.50.  I had better fish and chips at Ivar's in Seattle, WA and Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  It didn't worth it."}
{"text":"Unorganized.. 15 mins  wait ya right more like 40 mins .. Pete's drive tru quick n fast better"}
{"text":"Two words...Sea Dog!! Oh my goodness, they are so yummy. Take a hot dog bun (genius!), add a nice piece of fried Cod, coleslaw on top, and their very own red sauce and BAM! you got yourself a great Sea Dog!! The owners are super friendly as well as the staff. Try also the fried clams and oysters-super good!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place because it's a family operation and I like the idea of a family forming together like a team to make a living. Had the 2 fish and 4 shrimp combo and just cannot recommend it.

Fish was a processed brick Style with no mention of what type of fish it was. It was okay but not a lot of flavor. Sort of a weird sauce policy there. If you order the shrimp fish combo you get your choice of either tartar sauce or shrimp sauce. Then you have to take the empty container back up to the order counter if you want the other stuff to get some. Sort of petty if you ask me. Also the shrimp was one very small piece of shrimp cut in half and stretched east and west inside a large loaf of batter. Amazing that their clientele would even accept this as being okay. The price wasn't cheap but was reasonable if you got value for your money which you didn't. French fries were good but didn't come there for French fries. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant!! I understand why people say its not real fish and chips but i grew up on it and i dont care that its not your British pub style its still my favorite! The fried shrimp is not your typical but is sure is delicious. They have the best fried zucchini mushrooms and onion rings you will ever have! Also the super burger and fried burrito are my faves!"}
