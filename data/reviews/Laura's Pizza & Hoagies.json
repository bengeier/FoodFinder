{"text":"Nothing crazy special about this place, but I have yet to have a complaint about the food or service. I often visit here because I always hear about how much this place gives back to the community. The prices are fantastic especially for the quality and quantity of the food. The service is super friendly and very family-oriented. Although the decor of the place is very old-school, I am happy to have a place so close to get some good pizza. Plus they actually chop up their pepperoni instead of putting slices on their pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Although the local scuttlebutt is that Laura's has some of the best pizza in NEPA, I chose to get a Texas cheese steak and some fried mac N cheese bites, to go. And they were pretty good.  The Texas cheese steak is a sandwich consisting of Texas wiener sauce, a turmeric/mustard base chili sauce that's usually a hot dog topping, endemic to the NEPA area, shredded steak and American cheese, inside a hero roll. While the cheese is a bit heavy, overall, it's a sandwich that holds up pretty well in taste and neatness, i.e. you can eat it without worrying about everything dripping all over the place. Their fried Mac N Cheese bites, well, they taste like fried mac N cheese. If they took the excess cheese they put in their cheese steak into the bites, they'd have a hit.   Laura's itself is the standard NEPA decor: grungy walls, aged seating and an all around back-in-time look. With all this probably comes the last of the cigarette vending machines, that dispense real packs of smokes, and a vintage, early '80s video game. The staff and patronage are nice, and the kitchen seems to work their ass off making pizza pie after pizza pie for all of the call ins. The next time I hit the place - pizza and Texas wieners it shall be."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Whenever we visit from Maryland we make sure to get a tray.   My daughter (picky 5 year old) is also a fan.  The rest of the food is really good too.  Local, Cheap, Good.  Doesn't get any better.   Support local businesses!  Support Small Businesses!"}
