{"text":"Pricing is not great for the food that they serve. I tried my friend's food too, and it was decent, but not $30 decent. 

I ended up with a wrong dish and when I asked my server about it, they just said the dish's name in Italian and that it was what I ordered so I stuck with it because I didn't want to start an  unnecessary argument. The bill was $10 more than what I was expecting because of the mix up plus an additional 12% service charge that was added to the bill automatically because we were a group of 8. It's reasonable, but no one told us about this earlier so it was unpleasant surprise. 

Summary: the atmosphere for the place is good in the lounge area, but not so much for the dinning section. The food was mediocre at best but the pricing was not worth it. Service is lacking and it would had been better if they were more willing to be helpful. Would not recommend :("}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Vagabondo III for Valentine's Day dinner.  I am not sure what the restaurant is like on a non-holiday, but I would not recommend going here for Valentine's Day.  

First, the four course meal (that everyone had to get as they did not offer their regular menu that night) was, for lack of a better term, a rip-off.  We didn't have a choice for the first and fourth course and what came out were two small pieces of first, bruscetta, and later, two very small strawberries dipped in chocolate with a little bit of whip cream on the side.  For the second course, fortunately there were two choices, but unfortunately they ran out of one so we both had the same thing again.  And for the third course, while there were 4 choices, they all came with the same sides that tasted very bland.  The main course was in fact, the least delicious of all 4 courses.  That is to say, the bruschetta, the salad, and the dessert were actually not bad.  And, on another positive note, we left with our stomachs full despite the shortcomings.

Also, the restaurant automatically added a 17.33% gratuity to the check without informing us!  My experience has been that gratuity is added to parties of 6 or more and they will note it somewhere on their menu.  Not here, not that night.

So, all in all, the dinner was overpriced for subpar food.  We did have attentive service and nice ambiance, though.  Unfortunately, because we felt the restaurant took advantage of its customers on Valentine's Day, we will not be going here again and do not recommend it.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Toronto. The food is absolutely delicious and the staff is super friendly.  We were there at lunch time and they served us quickly so we could get back to work."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere which was very nice and relaxing as it was located in a quiet part of downtown Toronto. The waiter was absolutely amazing! He was sooo friendly and attentive to our needs! His service was unbeatable! Regarding the food.... I had the Veal Piccata and it was incredible! The meat was really soft and tender and literally melted in my mouth (wish i could say the same about the potato and vegetables though...just meh). The dish that my friend ordered also looked great as well. He had the Salmon Filet which he said was excellent! The Fried Calamari was delicious and probably the best I've ever had (they were big and crispy!). Overall everything went smoothly and it was a superb experience."}
{"text":"A recent gem of a find. We were enticed by its loungy cozy patio setting. The restaurant is impeccable in desigg. Their menu is a delicious assortment of wonderful Italian pastas, pizza's and salads. Our server was super accommodating and helped design on a wonderful seafood linguini in rose sauce. It was all that a seafood lover could ask for! The spice level was fabulous. The serving portion was enough to feed two. Overall a wonderful taste. 
Only bad thing: they don't have any highchairs, not family friendly/baby friendly, and their outdoor patio benches are uncomfortable. The food was too good though to cover all flaws."}
{"text":"Good service but food was disappointing. All entries I ordered were overcooked. The salmon, especially, was dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"We ordered from Just Eat while visiting Toronto. Delivery was so fast (I called the restaurant after placing my order asking for earlier delivery then the 2 hr time slot Just Eat gave us), super friendly and had no problem prepping the meal to be delivered ASAP!  Arrived fresh and hot and with lots of bread and butter! Yum! We were licking the plates after wishing there was more! We'll definitely eat here or order again when we are back in T.O."}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this gem while staying in Old Toronto.  We went on a Monday night so we essentially had the lounge to ourselves.  We would have been worried if not for the sparkling reviews the restaurant got on various sites.  Every word was true.  I had the Caprese salad and the Capellini Toscana.  Absolutely outstanding!  The calamari in the Capellini Toscana was cooked to perfection; it was the tenderest calamari I've ever had in my life!  My wife had the Caesar salad and the Spaghetti alla carbonara.  I had a taste of her entrée and it was incredible as well.

I would recommend this restaurant if you're craving Italian.  It was a wonderful experience from the food to the wait staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had lunch at this place and there was not a single redeeming thing about the food we were served. It was all truly awful. The escargot appetizer was lukewarm and was not seasoned--great if you're worried about salt intake, otherwise tasteless. The pizza promised grilled vegetables, but they had clearly been put on the pizza raw. It was a thin Italian-style crust, but was ruined by loads of bland mozzarella and virtually no tomato sauce. The prosciutto and pear appetizer had dried out prosciutto, very hard fruit and did not come with the promised parmigiano shavings. Instead the waitress offered to sprinkle on pre-grated parm. And the greens were dry--I guess you dress your own salad here. Honestly, it was shockingly bad. The prices are high enough that I anticipated good ingredients--it's not like these dishes take loads of skill to prepare. But it seems the dishwasher got promoted to chef today."}
{"text":"I want to note the positives first (there aren't many) - the food is quite good, besides the cold pizza my friend was served.  The staff is extremely friendly, helpful and attentive.  The service itself is sloooooow.  We waited 1.5hrs for our mains to come out and weren't even comp'd some apps for the wait time.  So here's the experience:

I made reservations here for the patio for a group of 14 for my 30th birthday.  Two different people contacted me on 2 different days to confirm my reservation.  Upon arrival, I noticed that the patio was full.  When we got inside I was told that unfortunately they had the patio booked 2 weeks prior and they were going to put us in their best private room.  Off to a terrible start as two employees confirmed my reservation 3 and 2 days before.  To me, it was a guaranteed group so they filled up the patio before we got there.  As mentioned before, we waited 1.5hrs before any of us got our main dishes.  There were a number of issues that arose throughout the evening and we had made numerous requests to speak with the manager.  Each time, the manager sent a server to take care of the matter.  Close to the end of the night I was so fed up with the managers attempts at evading dealing with the issues that I approached him myself.  He allowed me to voice my disappointment with my experience, however, I had to demand to have my meal refunded and also to use the card he gave us for \"next time\" on the same night.  There is NO WAY I will ever return to or even recommend this restaurant to others.  It's very unfortunate, because the food is quite good, the staff is great (albeit slow) the patio is great, but the management is terrible."}
{"text":"I'm not a professional and is purely my opinion. Went here last night with a group of 10 to celebrate a birthday.

The service was excellent (5/5). We were greeted quickly at the front. The server was super patient and gave everyone enough time to go over the menu and decide on drinks/food. Some individual order appetizer while others did not, but timing of the mains was perfect (allowed people with appetizers enough time to get a head start and then brought mains for everyone at same time). Our server was present when food was brought out of the kitchen and ensure everyone got the correct order.  Service was timely but at good pace (didn't feel rushed).

Food was good (4/5). At the table, consensus was that pastas and pizzas were good. Pasta was perfectly al dente (not undercooked but had a bite). Complain about the calamari appetizer was that it was a tad bit greasy and bland. One individual order entree dish and really enjoyed.

Restaurant decor and layout (3/5). Very typical decor for a Italian restaurant and nothing really worth remembering. There were couple of visible improvements that could be made. Mainly, the restaurant menus had scuffs and looked like they were starting to fall apart. Overall, the decor didn't seem to match logo, branding and feel of the restaurant entrance way which is very modern and hip. Maybe in the long run it is something that could be considered, but this is a personal. 

Overall 4/5."}
{"text":"Good from afar, far from good.

The outdoor patio with stylish furniture and yummy looking menu drew us in -  however looks can be deceiving :(

The patio cushions were dirty and stained all over...and the food was not nearly as delicious as we had hoped for. 

Boyfriend had fixed price option with the sauteed chicken breast (very buttery/greasy and bland) I had the Penne All' Arrabbiata which was mildly better but I found it was overwhelmed by the chilli flakes. I understand it is supposed to be a spicy dish - but it shouldn't just take like chilli-flake pasta.

A positive about my experience?  The service. Though a bit slow at times, the servers were attentive and genuinely friendly. 

Another positive?  If they would spring for new patio cushions  their patio would be a really nice place to have a drink on a summer afternoon or evening.

All and all - nice people and patio. If you're just looking for drinks outside I would recommend, however if you're hungry I'd pass."}
{"text":"A very nice looking Italian restaurant in a nice part of town, ideal for dates and special occasions. Margherita pizza was really good. Don't order the Italian soda, it's just San Pellegrino that they take out in a glass for you."}
{"text":"Reviewing Lunch Express.

Friendly service, good food and decent prices in a nice dining area.

If you work in this area, there is no reason not to go there for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday on a Saturday with 14 people.

Ambiance:
The decor of the restaurant is decent. Nothing too fancy or shabby. We were seated in a semi private room. 

Food:
I requested the Antipasto for appetizer and grilled salmon for entree. They also had a Prix Fix menu. The food was mediocre. The salmon seemed bland and not fresh. I am not a connoisseur of seafood but Ive had better elsewhere. Portion size was generous. 

Service:
Staff was very friendly and accomodating. Especially since we were a group of 14. Everything came on time and the wait staff took care of us. 

Value:
A little expensive relative to the quality of food. Could be because of the lower CDN$? Not sure."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service, good for birthday dinners."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and a family friend, unfortunately as we were walking there we got drenched, also unfortunately it was still summer and the air conditioning was still on full blast when we walked in. However, it was really dead and we got seated, menus handed to us and drink orders taken almost immediately. 
WE all opted to get soup for an appetizer as we were frozen, I had the soup with just the chicken broth and yummy yummy meatballs topped with scallion. It was fabulous I really enjoyed it and it most certainly warmed me up. My main was the the funghi risotto, it was very good but I think they went a little heavy on the wine. Alas it was not ruined, the portion was huge and I had lunch for the next day. My mom had the mussels which she said were very good and was the perfect amount. Our family friend had the eggplant parmesan (another app might I add) for his main and it was ginormous, he didn't even need the soup and only got through about 1/4 of the eggplant. Needless to say it was sent home with us. 
For dessert we decided the split the panna cotta, it was fabulous, beautiful texture accompanied by berries. I'm not sure how much the bill was because I didn't pay but the pricing is middle of the road about 10-15 bucks per entree. 
I really liked Vagabondo and since we are in the area quite frequently I'll definitely suggest we go back."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friends birthday. We had a party of around 20 people and were seated in a sectioned off area. All I gotta say is if you like Italian food, you should definitely eat here. The quality of the food and the amazing customer service is exactly what this place is about."}
{"text":"Good Italian food in downtown Toronto. I had the Tortellini, which is meat filled tortellini in rose sauce. It was good. The portion looked medium, but that's deceptive because the dish is deep, so the portion is large and quite filling. The service was good, with two waitresses taking turns helping me. They take reservations. If you're in the area and want Italian, I recommend Vagabondo."}
{"text":"Off to a bad start when we couldn't have a Caesar since they were out of Clamato! For apps we had the Bruschetta which was ok but nothing special and Calamari which came with an awful marinara sauce. Had the Gnocchi, Rigatoni Agli Spinaci and their specialty Fettuccine Vagabondo. I advise staying away from the rosé sauce dishes which the last two were. Unless you really enjoy peppercorns (2-3 per bite). Sauce itself was heavy and very creamy so not to my liking either.

Also stay away from the creme brulee which was horrible. Was runny and tasted like raw eggs. The cheesecake was actually very good. Service wasn't bad but our main dishes were brought out minutes after our apps arrived which was not cool. Definitely will not return here."}
{"text":"My gf and I stumbled on this place after a Raptor game. Absolutely amazing. If you love Italian food you are in for a treat. This is now our go to spot for Italian food. 

Service: very good and knowledgeable. They know the menu and recommend favorites. They are also very fast and check in regularly (we are big on Check ins lol). 

Food: 8/10. Portion sizes are HUGE. We both have yet to finish a meal here. So it's great value because we both get lunch for the next day every time we hit ip vegabondo. Tip: please have the bruschetta and veal parm. Your mouth will melt. 

Atmosphere: Never really over crowded. The patio is perfect. I threw my bday here and easily fit 40 people. They also gave us our own private section that was curtained off. So rare for a downtown restaurant to do nowadays. The music can be loud at times so if you are looking for a nice quiet romantic intimate dinner,  another venue would be best."}
{"text":"Wow.............

Great Italian food, attentive service and a relaxing ambience (DJ choices were all very tasteful).  

Our group of six started with bruscetta, mussels (pomodoro sauce), fried calamari and ceasar salad.  All good choices and washed them down with cocktails from the very hip bar.

Dinner  was superb!  I had steak and scallops - with a peppercorn cream sauce.  It was delicious and worked well with chianti.  My dinner mates tried vitello, steak and shrimp and grilled chicken. 

Tiramisu with cappucinos for dessert was a fantastic finish to a very enjoyable evening!

All of us highly recommend Vagabondo for your next meal in Toronto!

Buono Gusto!"}
{"text":"We seriously can't imagine why this place only got 3 stars. Our service was excellent, we had a fantastic seat on the terrace, and the food ... The food was amazing. We were really happy to taste Italian food again with nice flavouring that reminded of the Italian cuisine that we are used to. 

We loved it."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Ordered through Just Eat and it was great.

Pizza dough was wonderful and the toppings were plentiful. The meatballs as an appetizer were delicious and my friends who had the pasta raved about it.

The only downfall is that the place is expensive. The standard pasta's are around $20, so it's more of a spot for getting delivery for a special night.

Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 18 people here to celebrate my birthday, and I was quite pleased with the food and service. It's tough handling a large group, so kudos to them for doing a good job.

We ordered a few appetizers: grilled calamari, bruschetta, and antipasto italiano. At first, the waiter made a mistake and brought us deep fried calamari instead of grilled. When we asked him about it, he apologized and told us to keep the deep fried calamari on the house while he went to place the correct order with the kitchen. And boy, am I glad we insisted on getting the grilled calamari because it was the best appetizer of the bunch. The others were good, too, but this dish took the spotlight.

For my main, I ordered their most popular dish: Fettuccine Vagabondo - Fettucine with chicken strips, fresh garlic, sliced mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes in a rosé sauce. It was good and is probably a safe choice, but I believe there were better items on the menu.
I tried some of the Agnolotti Spinaci from someone else's plate, and it was really tasty. It's spinach agnolotti stuffed with spinach infused ricotta cheese, mushrooms and fresh baby spinach in rose sauce. 

Our dishes came out promptly, our glasses of water were filled regularly, and the food and wine were good. Probably not the best Italian food in Toronto (though, I'm no connoisseur), but the food was good, the prices are reasonable, and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Ordered a meatball sandwich via just eat, what a total waste of time and money, untoasted bun, cheese barely melted, the meatballs were literally flavourless balls of minced meat, like they rolled it into a ball right out of the package. barely any veggies, and again, the bun was untoasted, then just to make sure it was crap, they placed into a sealed container to ensure it was a soggy mess. I guess if you have low standards and no palette then this place is for you. if you do, then stay far away from this miserable establishment."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was horrible.  Gummy gnocchi, over cooked pasta, cold bruschetta. So disappointing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pasta and had asked around for where I could find amazing Pasta and a colleague recommended this place so I thought to go check it out on my lunch hour. I walked in and saw a sign asking to wait to be seated but there was no one at the door waiting to greet me. So I walked in further and poked my head around the bar area to see the hostess coming in from the patio area telling me she's coming (shit happens - no biggy) so being my first time I was told I could be seated on the patio and order from the menu or order from the express line up which has pasta / veal / chicken ready to go so they had about 5 different types of pasta so I asked for all of them with the veal, and not a single thing dissapointed. In fact I don't think I even stopped to breathe. 

The Lady at the cash's name is Oma and she's the mom if the owner.

Great establishment, good food, good people 

GO THERE!"}
{"text":"I went here couple days ago and another time before that for my  bestfriends Christmas work party. While walking over to this place, there are a lot of great restaurants I want to try on Wellington. As soon as we walked in, it was fairly busy and we had a section closed off just for our party. The inside is chic and trendy with loud lounge music. There was a group of 20 of us and the servers struggled to keep up. To start we had random shots of alcohol and apple martinis, it took our drinks awhile to come and we had to remind them. For appetizers we had the calamari friti and the bruschetta, which were so good. For main I had te butternut squash ravioli and it was also delicious. This time I had there tortellini and the meat filling didn't taste quite right, and didn't finish it. Other people on our table also found their steak cold or chicken pink and under cooked. The servers were really hard to get a hold of most of time and they were forgetting some of our entrèes that we ordered. For dessert, I had the pana cota and I had more fun making it jiggle to the music than actually eating it. I also tried the créme brûlèe which actually wasn't too bad but still wasn't too impressed. I think because I came here twice with a big group, and this place was busy with other parties and corporate events, that their customer service and quality of food suffered. I wanted to give this place a chance but I'm not sold for the price that you pay. Barely 3 stars for ambience, appetizers and alcohol."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. My friends and I had a reservation, but it was not needed - the place was almost empty.

SERVICE: Extremely Poor

While I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. 

MAIN: Caprese Salad

The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).

MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it) 

These fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate)."}
{"text":"I have been to Vagabondo twice now - once in the summer and the second time just yesterday and I must say the food is impeccable. The first time I went it was with a larger crowd and unfortunately I can't recall what I ordered, except that it was extremely good. Most of my friends ordered different items that night and everyone also agreed it was delicious. The second time I went, I took my girlfriend and we ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it could easily be one of the best calamaris I have eaten. For the entree I order the Fettuccine Vagabondo and she ordered the Linguine Monte Mare. Both of which were extremely delicious, the place is also very generous with their servings and both of us actually had to get takeaway bags. Our server was very polite and took care of us very well. The food in itself is not very expensive and for the portions that you get, very worth it. I would highly recommend this place if you enjoy good Italian food with large portions without having to spend an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Ordered a grey goose & red bull, but they only had intense extreme and served the whole can rather than a side car which was $13. 
Shared grilled calamari which was lukewarm and a bit rubbery. 
Ordered pizza w roasted red peppers & bacon which was lovely. I especially liked the tasty golden cheese & Parmesan. 
My date ordered vodka rigatoni which was delicious, but quite heavy. 
Didn't order dessert. 
Ambience may have been better..the syncapated beat of the music was annoying. Also sound & smell of someone scrubbing the tiles sounded like brushing teeth :)
Our menu had some funny scribbling inside which we found amusing. The server seemed very hurt that someone \"defaced\" it. We thought he overreacted a bit . 
Bathroom was easy to find & clean, nice. 
The outdoor patio looked like it would be nice for summer. There were some smokers sitting out there. I think there were heater lamps...it was chilly.  We were there on a Friday night & hardly anyone there.
May go back to hang on the patio on a warm summers night."}
{"text":"I have passed by Vagabondo many times, and I finally got to dine here.  It is located close to the St. Lawrence Market.  The decor is trendy, they played a good mix of music, and have \"party rooms\" that are separated with red curtains.

Parking is validated which is a big bonus for downtown!  After we were seated we were kept waiting for awhile before the server came to check on us.  They have a summer prix fixe menu of four courses for $35.  The portions were more generous than I anticipated.

First course: Feta Bruschetta on toasted Calabrese baguette served with garlic and olive oil, topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.  The tomatoes were fresh, and the feta cheese was divine.  Tres yummy!  

*NB* This was infinitely better than the bread basket they brought out.  The bread basket was stale, and the bread was cold.  Balsamic vinegar and olive oil are available at the table.  

Second Course: Insalata Estate with mixed greens, strawberries, slivered almonds, goat cheese and a raspberry vinaigrette.  Can you believe I was already starting to get full by the second course?  This salad is the same as an entrée sized Spinach Salad at Milestone's.  I loved the strawberries and goat's cheese.  However, the raspberry vinaigrette was too overpowering.  My word of advice - ask for the dressing on the side!

Third Course: Vitello a la Romana which is a tender provimi veal with fresh garlic, baby arugula and white wine topped with fresh slices of shaved parmesan.  It is served with steamed vegetables and potatoes.  The dish was swimming in oil!  The parmesan cheese was WAYYYY too salty, and the vegetables were bland.  The potatoes however, were quite savoury.

Fourth Course: Strawberry Cheesecake served with a chocolate drizzle.  I absolutely adored the cinnamon cheesecake base.  The cheesecake was quite tasty, although I found it to have a \"chalky\" consistency.  That didn't prevent me from devouring the entire slice, whipped cream and all!

In addition to the summer fixe menu I also ordered a grilled calamari that was slightly burnt, served on a bed of mixed greens.  If I had known the generous portion sizes of the summer fixe menu I would've passed on ordering another appetizer.  Again, a generous portion of calamari showed up on my plate.  

I also got to sample the Pizza Della Nonna, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, green olives, pepperoni and mushrooms.  It was a thin crust pizza that was delicious.  I did notice that some parts of the crust were burnt.  

The cheese ravioli was also quite tasty, although the cheese again had a \"chalky\" consistency to it.  I think the primary suspects in both the cheese ravioli and cheesecake chalky-ness was ricotta cheese!  

A bottle of E.J. Gallo White Zinfandel was ordered for the table.  It rang in at $37 for the bottle.

Verdict:
At the end of the day with tax and tip the bill came to $470 for our party of 8.  A few things I noticed was that the bread basket came out after our appetizers arrived, the servers didn't know who ordered what when the courses were brought to the table (we all had to raise our hands like roll call in primary school to claim our dishes) and there was a delay in the offering of parmesan cheese and ground pepper when the mains were brought out.  Positive things were that our water glasses were constantly replenished, and the hostess did a little something special for the birthday girl's dessert.  

Vagabondo is a nice place to go to for a private dining area, and its complimentary parking.  The ambiance and music make it a trendy restaurant.  I am definitely keeping this on my list of places to book a party at.  That and it is in close proximity to Pravda Vodka Bar in case you want to have an after party ;)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving Italian Friday night, but we also knew we didn't want to venture too far from our apartment. We had been to Vagabondo once before and remembered liking it so we figured since it was just up the street we'd head there.

It was even better the second time!

I had their rigatoni vodka which was one of the best \"a la vodka\" sauces I've had in some time. My girlfriend did their prix fixe menu, which for $35 got you two starters, a main, and a dessert. She said everything was incredible.

Our waiter was incredibly attentive, without being annoying. Granted the restaurant was practically dead, something I couldn't really understand given the quality of the food. There was also a live DJ there who was spinning some great tunes. 

We both enjoyed ourselves so much we decided we'd definitely be coming back more often. And the fact that they do delivery means we'll likely be ordering on those nights when we just can't be bothered to go out but want a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for Winterlicious. First course: feta bruschetta was average, second course: lasagna was very boring it tasted identical to a frozen box lasagna, third course: blueberry cheesecake was pretty good.

My friends got the salad to start which was pretty much just arugula and a couple shaves of cheese. My friend got the salmon which was tiny and over cooked. They also got the chocolate truffle cake which was good but nothing special it tasted like a loblaws cake...

On top of the disappointing food, the waiter was really rude and inattentive.

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Vagabondo is an Italian restaurant for those that aren't too bothered by the fact they serve mediocre Italian food. Overall, it does a decent job with the food and service but it doesn't do anything really well. The ambiance is a step up from an Olive Garden. The patio is one of the few great things this restaurant has going for it but I suspect even that may not be enough to truly set this place apart. After our generally unremarkable meal we were served coffee and each of us received half a biscuit - it was almost as though they were trying to cut costs by halving the cookies. In some way I think that's a great metaphor to describe the restaurant - it could be so much better but they cut corners just to scrape by."}
{"text":"I will not spend my money here again. Vagabondo is overpriced, the food quality is astonishingly low, and the service (although prompt) was less than professional. We were a group of 10 on the patio on a Friday evening after work and this beautiful outdoor space in the center of the downtown core was completely empty. Now I know why. The prosciutto and pear appetizer was unappetizing: the meat looked grey and there was far too much of it to be of any decent quality. The tomato sauce on the gnocchi likely came from a jar and the pasta itself was sticking to the roof of my mouth (i.e. not at all fresh). The pizza looked OK. A decent bottle of wine was $50 and the total for 3 people was over $140. On top of that, we were prompted to put everything on one bill because splitting it would \"take too long\". Extremely inconvenient and inconsiderate for a group of 10. I was also put off by the servers' uniforms: golf shirts for the men and skin-tight, backless and overly revealing dress-type things for the women. It made the restaurant seem cheap when in fact the prices reflected the opposite. This part of town would draw a great after-work crowd at an Italian spot with a large interior and inviting outdoor space but the quality at Vagabondo is just not there (particularly for the cost). Please improve!"}
{"text":"I ordered Fettucinu Alfredo as delivery, AND IT HAS NO SEAFOOD IN IT. so basically i'm paying 34$ for a plain pasta, and it don't even taste good. SHITTIEST EXPERIENCE ON JUST EAT EVER!!!"}
{"text":"I was here last night along with a bunch of other singles for a 25 dates speed dating event.

I don't really think speed dating and me are a good match but at least it was $6 martini night.  Your choice--gin or vodka rail plus olives or a twist.  The bartender was a one woman martini makin' machine.  I think I picked up some tips just watching her.  

Tip was automatically included which was kind of strange and somewhat convenient.  

There were apps but I did not get to any.  So, I can't comment on the food.  A few people out on the patio were eating and what passed by us in the bar area looked good.

As a regular space I can see how this place might work.  The patio is huge.  As a speed dating space, it suffers from acoustics in certain spots.  Obviously if you were here, on a regular date, and the place was packed with other chatty daters, you might have to strain to hear or be heard.  

I would likely not make a special effort to eat or drink here except if the drink special was worth it, such as Tuesday's martini deal.  The location is good and this part of Toronto offers a lot of other great place to spend your drink and food dollar; I'd simply be more inclined to try something else.  But don't let me dissuade you.  Give this place a fair shot and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"Basic basic basic food. I had the Chicken Alfredo and had to eat around all the chicken because it was hard. For the price I expect to get half decent food that I can actually eat. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Great place to meetup with friends.  Not super busy but the patio during the summer was filled. On Thursday, they have drink specials as well as free apps for those who want a quick bite before heading off somewhere else.  However, the dinner menu is surprisingly good.

Staff are super friendly and will try to accommodate your group even if it's over 20 people. Patio is away from Wellington which tends to be pretty busy during happy hour.  They have large umbrellas outside in case of slight rain.  Luckily, the place inside was able to accommodate such a large group when it did end up pouring.

It is a short walk from the core but it is a gem since service is great and not super busy yet.  For those who like Italian food, it is definitely worth a try. I have been on the patio and luckily have gone early enough to get a table.  If you are a regular, they will try to reserve a section on the patio.  Inside the bar area, they have a DJ playing music and for those sports fans, they have a few TVs and have truned up the volume during the playoffs."}
{"text":"The food was great! I really enjoyed the appetizers. We ordered bruschetta and the calamari. I also had the fettuccine vagabondo and it was really tasty. Our waiter was very friendly. Since they knew it was a bachelorette party, they brought out a slice of chocolate cake with whipped cream - a very nice touch. Would definitely recommend this place to friends :)"}
{"text":"HUGE PORTIONS. And ordinary-looking bread that is just shockingly delicious: crispy and fluffy. There was more meat / seafood in the pasta than the pasta itself. I have not seen this elsewhere. Decently priced for a resto in FiDi. Not Terroni quality but, folks, PORTIONS."}
{"text":"Food was good, but atmosphere was horrendous.

To start, they were BLASTING techno music.  There was no dance floor and the place was relatively empty with a few tables occupied, ours included, in the bar area.  Techno has no place in an Italian restaurant!  We even had to ask our server to turn it down twice just so we could hear her!   I longed for classical Sinatra.

I got the Pinot Noir which was \"on house special.\"  Clearly, that didn't mean cheap at $12/glass, which we didn't learn until the bill came.

Service was a bit flakey. Took awhile to get drinks. Got oil and vinegar for bread instantly, but waited another 10-15 minutes for the warm bread, which was tasty and crunchy.  2 minutes later, our entrees arrived. Timing was just terrible.

However, I had the rigatoni vodka w/ pancetta, and it was tasty.  Boyfriend had the lasagna, said it was a bit dry.  He never got the crushed red pepper he asked for.  Also, when they asked if I wanted fresh ground pepper or Parmesan cheese and I said both, the waiter seemed a bit annoyed.

Bottom line, if you go food is hit or miss depending on what you get.  Service appears to be the same.  And choose the patio, even if it's freezing, to avoid the awful music."}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything here over many many lunch breaks, the pizza isn't my favorite style but it is good - its a more traditional pizza, pasta/veal sandwiches always good for 6$ downtown can't really be beat and the toppings are really good as well."}
{"text":"They have a summer prix fixe menu of four courses for $35.  The portions were most generous for a fancy restaurant. However I myself did not order from prix fixe.

I ordered the Pizza Della Nonna, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, green olives, pepperoni & mushrooms.  It was a thin crust pizza that was baked very well as it possessed a very thin crisp layer on the outside of the crust while retaining softness inside which impressed me as the pizza crust itself was extremely thin. Ingredients were fresh & tasted wonderful when consumed in unison. I was very satisfied with my pizza. 

I got to sample some cheese ravioli that was decent. The ravioli was stuffed with what tasted & felt in consistency like ricotta cheese which I found to be quite interesting to consume as the texture of the cheese was kind of like biting into a block of feta.   

A bottle of E.J. Gallo White Zinfandel was ordered for the table. $37 for the bottle. This was a most enjoyable wine to drink with my meal as it went down real easy with no tart aftertaste.

This venue is great for a private dining, the ambiance & music is trendy &   has complimentary parking. I will definitely keep this place in mind as a celebration location."}
{"text":"Was here recently for a private function.  The food was meh...I just got some coconut shrimp appetizers b/c I wasn't too hungry and I needed a chainsaw to cut through them,  zero flavour..very disappointing.  The service was ok...although it took forever just to get some water.  good thing I didn't order an entrée!"}
{"text":"My BF took me here for my Birthday dinner and I loved it. There are 2 seating areas for dinner. One is the more typical restaurant area and the other is a dim light more romantic area with a large bar. We sat in the romantic side of course. Our server was absolutely amazing. very tentative but not in your face. The food was really good and authentic tasting plus the atmosphere was awesome. Even though it was a quite night in there you didn't see the servers effing around and doing nothing, which was good. It made me feel like they were aware of us and respectful. I felt really comfortable and was happy that he took me here.

I would recommend this place for a nice evening dinner. Definitely want to go back again."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

We were here a week or so ago.  It was nice.  We came here for dinner, at night, it's kind of hard to spot from the street....but we found it somehow.  

We were seated at the back, which was fine for dinner, but for some reason, at about 10:30pm, they pumped up the music super loud, and we were seated under a speaker of something.  We left promptly.

The food was good - I think I had the risotto - it was massive.  My friends ordered the veal and chicken parm, and and gnocchi - all delish - got good reviews.  We started with bruschetta and calamari.

A yummy experience, but only a so so dining experience."}
{"text":"I went to Vagabondo's for a four-course corporate dinner and the food was delicious. I had melt-in-your-mouth Bruschetta, a Caprese Salad done just right, a juicy N.Y. Peppercorn Steak, and a scrumptious Tiramisu cake to end the night. My colleagues also enjoyed their meals (and several glasses of wine). 

The only downside was that my waitress forgot to ask how I wanted my steak done, and it came out overcooked. Overall, it was a delicious meal with good service, especially for a large corporate group of 30+."}
{"text":"Vagabondo is an italian restaurant a little bit east of the business district with a nice chic decor and an extensive menu.

After we got seated, we pretty much ordered a bunch of appetizers and our entrees.  I ordered the grilled calamari, the bruchetta, and the procuitto with pear.  As for entrees, we had a combination of the gnocci, seafood linguine, and the angel hair goat cheese pasta.

When we got our appetizers, I must say that I was really impressed.  Let's start with the grilled calamari.  One word... Amazing.  There were two squid cut up and dressed with a balsamic vinegar glaze.  The slight burntness of the grilling and the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar was a superb pairing.  The bruchetta was quite nice.  Fresh bread with a nice medley of tomato, onion and spices on top.  Be sure to go heavy with the parmesan cheese!  The procuitto was actually not the greatest.  It seemed to me the same grade as the stuff you get in vacuum packages at costco.  However, the flavour pairing of the procuitto and the pear and honey glaze was quite nice.  Throw that on top of a bed of mixed greens and asiago cheese and the dish made up for itself.  I wish they used a better procuitto.

At first, all the entree dishes that came looked a bit on the slim side, but after a while of digging, you soon realized that the plates they served them in were pretty deep.  Quite a nice surprise when I was having trouble finishing my own plate.

The entrees were a bit hit and miss.  The birthday boy ordered a seafood linguine (which i tried, i know i'm going to hell).  Out of all the entrees we ordered, that was the best.  I would have traded if i could have.  The actual name of the dish was \"Linguine Monte Mare\".  The seafood linguini was nice and light, with a hint of seafood in the sauce.  Combine that with a nice bed of shellfish and it was quite a nice dish.

The gnocci was quite a bland dish.  All it really contained was a bed of gnocci, with sauce (pick your sauce, they had tomato, creme or rose).  A little bit of colour variance, or vegetable garnish would have gone a long way.  I felt i could have just boiled up a bag of gnocci and opened up a bottle of classico and duplicated the dish exactly.

The angel hair goat cheese pasta (\"Capellini Termine\") was actually quite pleasing to the eye.  Generous chunks of goat cheese, with peppers, herbs and pine nuts sat elegantly on top of a bed of angel hair pasta.  The angel hair pasta that it came with kinda reminded me of asian chow mien noodles, so that kinda threw me off.  but I think the worst thing about the dish was that the amount of goat cheese they put in took over the dish and was extremely overpowering.  Eventually the cheese melted into the pasta and created a giant goat cheese sauce that was not exactly the lightest thing.

The only thing that bugged me about the service was the lack of it after the entrees were served.  When I worked in the industry we were told to check up on the table about 5 minutes after you served the entree.  This was non existent.  As you know, my pasta was quite a hard one to put down and water would have been a godsend.

If I had to go back to Vagabondo, I would defiantly recommend the appetizers.  I would actually suggest this place as a casual wine and app date.  With nice window seating and a beautiful and tasty selection of appetizers, Vagabondo serves up a stylish starter to the night that would impress anyone."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant has been here for many years but this is the first time I went. I found the food to be pretty average compared to the other great Italian restaurants we have the city. We got the meatballs and meat board for our appetizer, which was good, but honestly I don't think I have ever had bad meatballs or meat board. Our main was Chicken Parmesan; it was a huge portion, too much food for both of us to eat. I found the breaded chicken good, however the cheese on top got cold very quickly, which makes me think this was pre-made. Unless you eat this very very quickly, it is not a great tasting meal. We did not get dessert. 
Our waitress was very attentive, and overall the service was fantastic!

I wouldn't come back here any time soon. The service was great but the food wasn't anything I couldn't make at home."}
{"text":"Well I would give this place a one star but the appetizers were delicious... 

The main courses however, were not so good. In fact they were not even edible. The veal and chicken parmigiana were both hard and strange tasting like, fish, yes fish.... I do not know why or how but we both agreed on a fishy tasting chicken and veal parmigiana. They seemed to be overdone, they were so tough you could barely cut into them.. The chicken was only slightly more edible then the veal  but needless to say we sent both of them back to the kitchen.

The night started off so well, the appetizers were fabulous, we got a Caesar salad that was a generous portion with a nice homemade dressing and the brochette pizza which was soo yumm!

Too bad the main courses wasn't good, we were not expecting the outcome to be so damn bad terrible!

I may go back again, even just for the appetizers as they were very good."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner with some friends. The atmosphere is nice. The wait staff is a tad slow, especially in getting our menus - but it was Super Bowl Sunday, so probably quieter than usual. The food was overall delicious. The salmon was very well made, though the veggies were a little bland. Yummy Italian ice cream. If you don't like parsley, make sure to say so - as that is sprinkled on everything (like most Italian restaurants).

Would stop by again."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (5)
Located on the ground floor of a corporate building in financial district. Dimly lit with two distinctly different sections - one more classic Italian restaurant style, the other a sleeker, dark stone and leather lounge. Tables, floors, and washrooms were clean.

SERVICE (3.5)
Was seated immediately when we arrived for our reservation at 6 pm. Our waitress came by with water and gave us a couple minutes with the menu. Service is mostly quick and friendly. However, near the end of the night, when a large party arrived in the other section, our waitress disappeared on us. We were hoping to catch the next train and tried to flag another waiter (2 other waiters in our section), who turned blind eyes. Took about 20 minutes to finally get the bill. 

FOOD (3.5)
Winterlicious menu has a pretty limited appetizer menu but several interesting mains. I ordered the Insalata, Blackened Salmon on Risotto, and their Tiramisu. Salad was standard fare - balsamic dressing on spring mix with walnuts, strawberries and goat cheese. The blackened salmon and risotto were cooked well, but not noteworthy. The tiramisu was soft and creamy though, which I enjoyed.  

QUALITY/VALUE (3.5)
At $33 for Winterlicious, our meals were well priced. However, other menu items are significantly more expensive, due to location (financial district) and cuisine (higher end Italian). Definitely worth a visit for the Winter/Summerlicious prix fixe and is a nice environment for after work drinks. 

OVERALL (3.5)
Everything was A-OK."}
{"text":"After a year of not coming here, I came back to Vagabondo for a re-visit since it was a gorgeous day, and we wanted a patio.

We were placed in the front patio - quite chic and beautiful. It allows you to look over to Berczy Park across the street.  We had a waiter with a cute Australian accent who was friendly and checked up on us every once in a while.

We initially ordered the antipasto salmone ripeno.. However, the waiter accidentally brought over another antipasto dish... We told him that we didn't order it, so he took i back and also told us that there wasn't any smoked salmon in the kitchen.  Bummer.  So we opted for the calamari fritti.  It wasn't that amazing - I think I've had better calamari at Hot House Cafe or whatever. 

Anyhow, my friend orders the Fettuccine Alla Pescatore, and I order the special of the day (I believe it was a Rigatoni Alla Vodka).  I was actually surprised by how much seafood they had in my friend's fettuccine.  My rigatoni was great, and quite filling -- couldn't even finish it.

We ended off the meal with a mango berry cheesecake.  Good, but I feel like I've had better cheesecake as well.

All in all, a great atmosphere.  Quite surprised they didn't have the different sizes for pasta anymore though."}
{"text":"Have been coming here once a week for lunch for the last 8 years. That should sum it up. Lunch express is awesome. Have tried almost everything. Their gnocchi with the white alfredo pesto sauce is probably the best i have ever had. Probably the best lunch meal you can buy for apprx $10. At night, the place becomes into fine dining with a little extra dent on the wallet. But the service and food is solid."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Staff very friendly and attentive. Only wish they had their DJ there as advertised."}
{"text":"It is great for groups during the summer or the surprising hot table at the back where you can have an affordable lunch.

Food is in line with prices and beer selection could be improved and thus great for groups that are not sticking around.

Stiff competition in the neighborhood for great food (mmmm. St. Lawrence) brings the ranking down in my view."}
{"text":"Pleasant and accommodating service. My drink order (classic martini) took a very long time but the food was served fairly quickly after ordering. I had the spinach salad followed by the Agnolotti Spinaci. The salad was a miss - it look like they dumped a bag of spinach into a bowl, threw sliced button mushrooms in it and sprinkled it with an off-the-shelf balsamic dressing. The pasta, however, was pretty tasty. Unfortunately, as we ate and I pulled the olives out of my almost finished martini, I saw fruit flies floating around in the bottom of the glass which was a bit off-putting. I told the server and sent the rest of the drink back.

I'm not a fussy eater and rarely get flustered by small issues - fruit flies are annoying but understandably challenging at certain times of the year and they get into everything. All in, this would have been a better rating if, when the bill came, I wasn't actually charged for my fly-tini. I asked the server if she really intended to charge me for the drink and she said she could take it off the bill \"if you would like\". I \"liked\"...and she did...but I don't see a return visit to Vagabondo."}
{"text":"I came for Winterlicious on a Monday night.
Server was not especially attentive and I got the vibe that we were judged for ordering only the Winterlicious menu and nothing else. She seemed more pleasant to larger groups and customers that ordered from the regular menu.
We got warm bread shortly after placing our order. Bread was hot and fluffy.
First course I got the minestrone soup, not the greatest since the liquid was scarce and it felt like a vegetable stew.
Main I got the Veal. It was generally pleasant, veal was tender and worked well with the mushrooms. Potatoes were beautiful seasoned with a crisp crust. Grill veggies were kind of under, but all in all quite delicious. My companion also enjoyed her salmon and risotto.
For dessert, I got the Fruit Torte. The cake was moist and not overly sweet, but it felt like a slice of generic supermarket fresh cream fruit cake.
I felt the meal was enjoyable and would appreciate better service. I don't think there was much that's memorable that would make it stand out, but I wouldn't mind coming again."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with great food and amazing service. I planned a surprise party for my boyfriend there and they were very accommodating and kind. Service was amazing. They have pretty big portions, definitely worth your money!"}
{"text":"Their salmon pasta was amazing!!!! Came here on a paintnite event with friends and we really had a good time. Server was quick with our orders including the drinks and I cant really say anything bad about this place."}
{"text":"We reserved for a group of 24 people 4 days ahead. 
We got a private room which was great for conversation and the servers were nice. BUT, food took forever to come out!!! Ordered almost 30 mins later then appetizers came out 30-1hr after that and some people didnt get their food until 1.5 hr after they ordered. 
Food was good. Nothing spectacular, but would come here if food came out at a reasonable time.
Pizza, spinach pasta that were like ravioli but shaped like dumplings, soups. Most people liked their food."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious on Friday after work. 
It was quite empty at 5:30pm on a Friday but by the time we were done the patio was full. I had the calamari, chicken and tiramisu. The portions were very generous, and the chicken was cooked very nicely. Bread is only given out on an ask basis for summerlicious diners.
Not a bad deal for a financial district restaurant."}
{"text":"I went for a formal event a few weeks ago. I spoke to the staff beforehand about my severe milk allergy and they seemed to completely understand; however, three bites into my plain spaghetti with marinara sauce, I started to have an anaphylactic reaction. I ended up leaving and going to the hospital, having a near-death experience and spending the night in the hospital. The restaurant never compensated me for my experience and refused to acknowledge that there was milk in my food. Don't go here if you have dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were looking for a dinner joint a few weeks before Christmas. We hadn't made a reservation anywhere, so as we walked south from work, we couldn't find anywhere open that could accommodate our party of 2. 

Enter Vagabondo. Tucked away on the main floor of a large building, I wouldn't have known it was there if my friend hadn't been there before. We walked in and were seated immediately - I didn't get a chance to see the whole space but I think there are multiple areas to house various sizes of group.

We started off with some cocktails and WOW, really LOVE the cocktail menu here! I like trying different drinks at every round and we were not disappointed. We tried the caribbean breeze (delicious!), apple crisp (good, but not something I could drink all night), electric lemonade (great!) and the summer breeze (great!). Honestly, I'd come back here for pre-dinner cocktails anytime. Wonderfully composed drinks.

We split the arancini as a starter and they were delicious. Well seasoned, the sauce was to die for and the balance of cheese to rice to sauce was perfection. We wiped the plate clean with the bread we had!

I had the Piccata Di Vitello (veal piccata) and while it was very good, I felt like they over did it with the lemon. It was almost overwhelming the dish and I ended up scraping most of the sauce off so I could temper the lemon flavor with each bite. The portion size on my meal was perfect but the pasta dish my friend had was HUGE. It looked like she'd barely made a dent after we'd been eating for half an hour.

Overall, a fantastic experience. The ambiance here was wonderful, the area we were seated in was quiet and somewhat dark, it would be perfect for a romantic dinner. The service wasn't overbearing, we had the bartender as our server and she was very prompt and mixed wonderful drinks. It was a perfect evening out, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Vagabondo after my usually pizza joint in the area (Uncle Tony's) let me down by being unexpectedly closed! 

Vagabondo has a beautiful and very large patio which was exactly what we were looking for. It was basically completely empty - and looking into the large restaurant inside, it was empty too. 

We shared a meatball appetizer which was quite delicious, and a Caesar salad (wouldn't order it again, soggy with dressing), and some pizzas. All the food was acceptable, though the meatball appetizer was the stand out. Nothing to write home about. 

The service was only ok, which was surprising considering we were basically their only table. I thought it was slow and abrupt, plus I had something dropped on me twice so that's never fun. 

Overall, I'm surprised such a large restaurant can survive considering how empty it was, but they must be swamped during the week to compensate. 

My overall thoughts are that with a ton of great places in the city, why waste your time on only ok?"}
{"text":"Ideally, I would give this restaurant 4 1/2 starts but since I can't, I rounded up.  

I had dinner here tonight with five friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  I love the vibe and decor of this place.  It has dark and modern decor with funky lighting fixtures.  The music was a little on the loud side but we didn't mind.  It gives the place a \"happening\" feel - definitely not a stuffy place to eat.   There also appeared to be a few more private areas to the restaurant which catered to larger private parties.

Our server was great.  I don't have anything negative to say about him.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive but not in an intrusive way.  

On to the food.  The waiter brought us a basket of bread and unlike another reviewer who said the bread was cold and possible stale, our bread was warm and delicious.  Maybe the management read his review and made a change.  

We shared four different apps and like the other reviewers, we thought that they were superb (all but one of them were amazing).  The only disappointment for me was the gamberi coco (coconut shrimp) which I found to be dry and overcooked.  I like coconut but found it to overpower the shrimp.  

The grilled calamari was outstanding - perfectly cooked and served on a greens on top of a spicy sauce.  I can't wait until the summer when I can come back to sit on the patio with a glass of wine and this dish. The one member of our group who was not a calamari fan actually tried and enjoyed it.  

We also shared the antipasto italiano (which was yummy) and the caprese salad which the waiter brought to us in individual portions (which was very cool).  Each portion had two pieces of flavorful slices of tomatoes with bocconcini cheese on a huge bed of arugula (my favorite).  

We all enjoyed our entrees (five of us ordered pasta dishes and one person had the salmon).  I ordered the linguine monte mare (linguine with tiger shrimp and mushroom in a rose sauce).  It was delicious and the portion was huge!  I took most of it home since I was full from the apps.  Looking forward to eating it for dinner tomorrow night.  

We were pleasantly surprised by the manager's unsolicited offer to treat us to coffee/cappuccino/espressos, etc. which four of us gratefully ordered.  It was a classy touch and a nice end to a great evening.  

I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"We ran into this place trying to avoid a lightening storm last weekend, and were warmly greeted when we came in. We had not planned on coming to this place, but were pleasantly surprised by the decor.

The music was a little loud, but we sipped our wine and beer waiting for our food. We were surprised that we didn't get bread right away so we ordered bruschetta. It was okay. I have had much better. Wait for their regular bread, It's hot, a little doughy, and tastes great with olive oil and balsamic. I just wished they served it right away. 

Their personal pizza's are huge. My mom could only eat 1/2. I got the gnocchi which was good. We waited awhile for our second round of drinks, they never came, so the waitress apologized and took them off the bill.

I definitely think this a good place for groups. We saw some people here on first dates, and seemed too loud for them to have engaging conversations. I am glad we ran into this place. We left full, satisfied,  and it was good place to go to get out of the rain."}
{"text":"I came halfway through a booked event with a reasonably large group, so my review  lacks a lot of the nuances that one describing a full meal might have.  

Vagabondo's patio is large and servers accommodated the 20+ people in attendance very well.  No one was without a drink for longer than a couple of minutes.  

Appetizers included bruschetta, various pizzas, something stuffed and deep-fried into a finger-ready shape, and other usual suspects.  They were all good but smacked of a kinda cheesy North American approach--which absolutely has its place in the big carb-ulous world of Italian food but isn't typically my preference.  

Overall, Vagabondo was unremarkable but not bad, and I definitely appreciated the service.  Big groups are really hard to handle well.  I'd have to return for a proper meal, but my intuition tells me that this is another star in the constellation of expense-account Bay Street establishments."}
{"text":"I came for a nice patio dinner with friends and received horrible service with mediocre food. 
It took 30m for someone to serve us water.  
We would ask for something it would it would take forever to get it.  Otherwise if we didn't get it we would have to ask 1 2 3 times more for the same item.  
To the point where when we didn't get what we needed one of us walked up to the DJ and ask him where he asked our waiter Nevin was doing something else at the back.  
I would understand the poor service if it was a busy night with a full patio and restaurant.  Buy there were 2 groups of 4... 1 group of 8 and us.  Oh I forgot 1 guy at the bar.
I have been here before a long time ago and the service was just the same.  Sad nothing has changed in 5 years. 
FAIL FAIL FAIL."}
{"text":"Really disappointing food quality from a higher end Italian restaurant. We ordered the gourmet burger and a pizza, as well as tiramisu. Everything seemed on par with a fast food diner."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary date with my fiancé and the service was great. The host, bartender and owner all worked together to ensure our time at Vagabond was spent well. I originally ordered the lamb and when I tasted it, it was bland. I am always very worried about ordering lamb. They took the dish away and allowed me to choose something else. I ordered the stuffed chicken breast, it was amazing! My fiance's seafood pasta was also amazing. Love this place. Very nice inside. Would definitely recommend it! Cheers"}
