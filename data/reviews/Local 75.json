{"text":"If your looking for above average pub food with generous portions and decent prices then this is your place...cause Monkland can be $$$$$."}
{"text":"We had a couple appetizers and the service was quick- food was tasty and portions were perfect sizes to accompany a drink. Overall I'm satisfied!"}
{"text":"I can only critique this spot for lunch which I shared with a friend today. Everything about this place works, from the decor, service, and menu options. It's spotless clean including the bathrooms and the music is soft and pleasant. Another positive are the prices for beer, wine, etc. The only negative we found was the food. My veggie burger was just OK but the bun it was served on was dry and too thick, making the whole thing huge and messy to eat. The side salad was fine. My friend's Cobb salad was also acceptable but not special. I will return, however, once the terrasse opens and I can enjoy a drink and appetizers in the sunshine."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening with a friend. It looked cosy and we wanted to check it out since it was new and right there in Monkland Village.  ATMOSPHERE: A laid-back, chill place. Good atmosphere - no super loud techno/crappy music. A plus right there lol.    DRINKS: Drinks were good. I enjoyed the Sangria. They have a good selection of drinks and cocktail. Beer list is a bit limited.  FOOD: We shared a few snacks (didn't have a full meal here - though I found the prices on the high side on the menu). I enjoyed the taste of the Roasted Buffalo Cauliflower- though the sauce was way too thin/runny. And the Cauliflower could have been crispier. The crab cake was ok - far from the best I've ever had, but far from the worse. The Avocado bocconcini snack was good - but again, nothing special.  OVERALL: It's a cute place with a chill vibe if you're looking to grab a drink in a cool place in Monkland Village. I wouldn't necessary go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This place has only been open for 2 months. So we walked in on a Saturday shortly before 5 pm. Grabbed a table (which was a good thing since there are only about 8 tables) near the door. Bad move - it's freezing outside and every time that door opened I wanted to put  my coat, scarf and mitts back on. We said hello to the waitress, she said to sit anywhere. We sat.   Then we waited.   And waited.    Oh, how we waited.    Finally the bartender noticed that we were still there on our own.    He brought over some menus.     Finally the very nice young girl in a white dress blouse and odd Lululemon yoga pants ( with long lacy cutouts on the legs....strange choice of uniform) came over and told us it was happy hour so any drink we bought came with a free appetizer (choice of 4 different appetizers).     We said that was great and we would be staying for supper as well as beer and appetizers.  Ordered our beer and free appetizers.   That's when another waitress started her shift.     The new waitress came to tell us that the appetizers were free during happy hour which only happened during the week, Monday through Friday.    She asked us, \"The waitress told you they would be free?\"    We said yes, she absolutely did.    This one  said we'd have to pay for them.    Now, you could cause a stink and argue but we aren't those people so we said we'd still take the appetizers at a cost. The appetizers were brought to us.    This new waitress gave us our next head-scratcher....... \"Did the other waitress tell you that you can only order your food after 5:30 pm?      Before then, the kitchen is busy doing prep and they only start to cook at 5:30 pm.\" Now, I checked the website before coming, they didn't mention that.   Neither did the first waitress. Again......we could have been cranky but we decided to hang out and enjoy so we said we would wait.    We ordered 2 more beers and the food came.      We started with buffalo cauliflower (great to go with beer but would have been so much better with a blue cheese dip) and honey jerk wings (3 very small wings, good sauce).    Both appetizers are $5.00. We never saw the first waitress again.     It was probably the end of her shift.   Or maybe she had a yoga class.      Supper came......I had the exact shrimp (5 pieces) on pasta with Parm cream sauce dish that you will find at every single restaurant.     Nothing stood out about this dish other than it needed  sauce to actually call it a cream sauce.  There was no sauce in the bowl whatsoever - trust me, I checked.    I moved every noodle, hoping to find a little sauce.     There was none to be found.       He had the Guinness braised lamb shank with lima beans and creamy polenta (totally passable). We actually enjoyed the appetizers more than the main dishes - they weren't very creative but they came well seasoned. The second waitress was very nice, we have no complaints with her at all, other than someone needs to tell her NOT to call people \"guys\".    I'm not a guy.    I'm a 50 year old woman who is spending great money and tipping 20%.     Don't call me \"guy\" or \"dude\", please. Supper came to $100 with tax.  So, would we go back?     Sure, for beer at happy hour with appetizers but not for supper.    I'm NOT a fan of restaurants on Monkland and this one didn't change my mind but if you look at it as a pretty bar to hit while on your way home for a beer, you'll be very happy.     Very attentive bar service is a huge plus as they have a lot of seats along the bar."}
{"text":"I went there recently for dinner with friends was presently surprised. The vibe, service, food & pricing were all very good. We ordered the hamburger which came with a good size salad & fries. Nothing was skimped on here. Also order a shot of Jamieson each. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Local 75 bistro is really quite unique Its classic thirties motif will, your interest, pique: Tiffany lamps and wooden shelves surround a wooden bar. Or grab a wooden table if you'd rather sit afar. If, perchance, your cup of tea isn't just the venue I'm quite  sure you will agree that it is in the menu. There is a separate menu, for lunch, dinner and late. Service very friendly, you never have to wait. There's Cubans, Reubens, salads,  a nice crispy crab cake Pasta, burgers, swordfish,  and tortes they themselves make. And its all homemade, even the chicken pates, And if you aren't hungry, they've a nice  blend of lattes.  Wash them down with a retro mixer -- Martini, manhattan  or some other elixir.  And when you leave it won't feel like Lent, Yet you'll still be able to pay your rent."}
{"text":"Great Food and drinks, what more could you ask for?   I always order the steaks and depending on availability, the cut changes from week to week, they are always perfectly aged, cooked medium rare to perfection and always tasty.  The good is very good.  The place is always busy,  but relaxed at the same time.  The drinks are good, I am not picky as far as drinks go, but appreciate my single malts, and their selection is good.  Although there are other bars and pubs in the area, I appreciate the atmosphere at Local 75"}
{"text":"Pretty typical pub fare. Had caesar salad and a burger. Neither was terrible but not fantastic either. Nice venue but wouldn't go out of my way to return. Service was decent but could have been a little more attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to local 75 a few times and it is my fav place on monkland to get a simple but tasty dinner and a drink or two. They are located on a pleasantly lively part of monkland ave and there's outdoor seating in summer.  Rain, snow or shine, there are always people in there having lively conversations - so if you are in the neighborhood, this might be the perfect spot to shake off the winter blues :)   To me local 75 is the perfect example of what comfort food next door should be: no fuss, tasty food, friendly service and a lively cozy vibe all in a small, tastefully decorated restaurant hidden in your corner of the city, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown."}
{"text":"Fantastic fried chicken sandwich with spicy mayo, seasoned fries and salad. I love the fact that you have a choice of fries, salad or both. Portions are generous and 15$ price point is reasonable. Only had lunch but will return for 5-7 and dinner. My new favourite pub on Monkland!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks here with some friends and loved how cute and cozy this place was that it didn't even bother me that it was packed and getting around inside is a serious mission. There's not much seating yet to get to the bathroom you need to bother everyone in the place. It's a Fight Club ass or crotch situation. My first drink was their take on an aperol spritz which was actually pretty sad. It was tiny, flat and not really tasty. However my following drinks ended up being really nice  I ended up ordering their burger which was deeeelicous! I love a good solid bar burger and it really hit the spot. Can't wait to try their steak next time!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Cute small bistro/pub with a great 5 à 7   Firstly, my search for a place that serves Dublin Pub Cider is finally over! Local 75 serves the delicious fruity cider and it made my evening.  We were informed that their 5 à 7 special is that if you order one of their drinks or beers you get one amuse bouche for free. The waitress highly recommended the buffalo style roasted cauliflower, so I followed her suggestion and also got the caesar salad bites.  My 5 caesar salad bites arrived first, and it was crunchy and refreshing. Small lettuce leaf boats with a dollop of caesar sauce, parmesan shavings, and 1 crunchy crouton. Definitely, a fun mouthful to have. The winner was definitely the cauliflower. If you think it is healthy, it isn't as there is a lot of oil despite being roasted. The generous portion of cauliflower is coated with an equally generous amount of buffalo sauce. The tabasco really came through, and I savoured every morsel. As I looked around, their larger dishes looked and smelled equally as delicious.  The server was very sweet, and I would have to say also patient with us even after we stayed a little longer after paying for our receipts. To be fair I was still nursing my sweet cider, but they were very busy and clearly needed the table. It get's very busy oddly after the 5 à 7 even on a Wednesday!   I definitely will be coming back as it's a great place in Monkland village to grab a delicious cider and tapas style pub food with friends or even a date."}
{"text":"This is a new-ish addition to the monkland village food scene and I finally got around to trying it out for myself. I stopped in for lunch with a friend. The first thing I noticed was the decor, it was so cozy but so pretty inside it almost has a retro/chic feel to it that I really enjoyed. Our server was so friendly and took great care of us. I ordered the Chicken quesadilla with salad on the side and she ordered the shrimp roll with fried on the side and we both had the iced tea. My Queensland was pretty big with nice big pieces of grilled chicken and fresh veggies and gooey cheese inside (what more can you ask for ? :) ) and my salad was fresh mixed greens with a nice light dressing. My friend really enjoyed her shrimp roll and fries she said the food was fresh and well prepared. We both really enjoyed the ice tea also (it tasted home made since it had a really nice flavour to it). The prices were so cheap for lunch and the food was tasty, fresh and at a great portion size. I will definitely be back here to try them out for dinner and a drink , especially in the summer time when I could also enjoy the outdoor seating. This seems like a nice place for a casual date or to hangout with a friend (May not be the best for bigger groups due to limited seating, as the location is not very big). Overall , I really liked this place and it is a nice addition the the restaurants on Monkland."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor! Cozy atmosphere. The food and drinks are delish AND well priced!! The waitstaff is super friendly. Definitely my favorite spot in Monkland village. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Visited a few days ago for lunch. Bistro itself is very nice and well finished. Service was average along with food. Hamburger plate has generous portion . I love hamburgers, this was an average burger. Chicken Caesar was again average. Prices are what you would expect for Monkland Village ( slightly higher than they should be). Might go back if in the neighbourhood and walking by, but many other better places for food are out there."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quiet lunch , cozy decoration and good service, i like a lot the appetizers but for the main lunch i dound too salty fries also salty croque monsieur. It seems very popular and busy for souper."}
