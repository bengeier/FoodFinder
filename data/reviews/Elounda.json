{"text":"Wow, very impressive for me, coming from Southern California.  Saturday night busy and the parking lot was full. But after eating there, I would park on Rue St. Denis and walk a few miles, it's that good. First, the staff was very pleasant and even kept up with my crazy \"humour\".  But the food was the best I've had in a long time. The appetizers, shrimp, scallops, octopus, mushrooms, etc., were served hot and so flavorful that I wanted to go in the kitchen and compliment to chef. Frankly, if I was a competitor, I'd have to kidnap the chef.  We were three and had the lamb, sea bass and seafood linguini, which I had.
The others were enjoying every bite and my seafood linguini was nicely presented, encircled by clams, and \"stuffed\" with shrimps and scallops and a thickened red sauce that added a real punch without masking the seafood flavours. We had a great, light Greek wine and port after dinner. This dinner was definitely the highlight of my Montreal visit. My cousin picked up the tab which was a bit pricey, but well worth the five star experience. Thanks, Cuz!"}
{"text":"this is my favriote high end greek joint in montreal everything you get on the menu is fresh and delicious . if you go dont get full on the great appetizers you should try the lambchop or the chillean seabass .and dont forget the honey balls 
enjoy"}
{"text":"Just took my mom for dinner on Saturday night. The food is good but way overpriced, completely unjustified. For example, an appetizer of 4 overcooked shrimp for $33! Are they kidding? Portions are very small but prices are ridiculously over the top. Unless you have enormous amounts of undisposed income that you don't care for, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nous avons soupé chez Elounda dernièrement nous avons commandé une pikilia en entrée le tzaziki était bon mais  trop épais à mon goût ca avait l'air d'être de la crème sûre, la tapenade de fève ne goûtait rien manque de punch l'aubergine pas à mon goût du tout les autres trempettes était correct ma préféré celle qui était épicé g oublié le nom le prix ok la quantité aussi . Aussi commandé l'assiette de calamar frits c'est  était bons, la portion trop généreuse j'aurai peut-être rajouté un choix de sauce à côté par contre le prix est trop cher pour un Resto du genre le décor ne casse pas des briques je le vois plus comme un Resto du genre apportez votre vin notre serveur était bien serviable et nous fait oublier le prix il a été très aimable"}
{"text":"This is a Greek restaurant with a complete menu of seafood. It resembles Milos (food wise) a bit.

The first thing one notices when you open the menu is that it's extensive, nicely balanced but the prices are pretty steep.  Then you look at the description of the dishes and it's mostly seafood or other expensive ingredients such as lamb chops. So you think, well if it's prepared masterfully by a chef it would be fair pricing. Although the 130$ fisherman's platter for one was still a shocker.

Then you look at the wine list and the prices are simply ridiculous. 

We started out with a typical Greek salad and some saganaki.  Both were ok but just seemed  thrown together quickly.

When we ordered our plate a couple of us asked to substitute rice for fries or salad.  We were told no substitutions were allowed.  I can understand such a policy at McDonalds but not when one is paying 40$ or 50$ for a plate. 

The plates we ordered (tuna sushi style, fried calamari, baked fish, lamb chops) were all good but none were special.  Again the feeling was that it was thrown together quickly by a decent cook but not a chef.  The quality of the ingredients varied from acceptable (tuna) to excellent (vegetables). The quantity of the food was good but not overflowing (which could justify the $$).

The service is informal and attentive. It's a large place (seats over 100) and nicely decorated.  When we were there on a Friday night it was about half full.  Bathrooms are small (one stall was out of order) and not very clean which to me is a big no no in a fine restaurant.

In my opinion, the value is just not there.  It's sad because it's a complete seafood restaurant which there aren't many of in Montreal. If the food was prepared more masterfully and the service more professional they could justify most of their prices.  Unfortunately it leaves the customer with the impression of being gouged.  There are many other restaurants in Montreal offering fish or Greek food that is just as or tastier for significantly less money.

I would not go back.

p.s. This restaurant shares a parking lot with 3 or 4 other restaurants. On a Friday night it was impossible to find a spot on the lot. Parking on the street is far away and requires 5 to 10 min. walk back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the worst restaurants I have EVER been too. The food tastes like rotten liver and the service is worse than a death trap. I will never ever be back. I found spit in my octopus and it's not worth ever going back too. NOONE go there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is similar to Milo's but at half of the cost. They have a full seafood menu and I ordered the grilled octopus and the elounda special (fried zucchini and eggplant with store made tzatziki). One word: delicious!

We then ordered Chilean seabass which was one of the best I've ever had .

The service was nice and friendly and made the dining experience that much better.I would definitely come back and recommend first time guests to try this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place will gouge you. I can list five other Greek places that will give you the same quality of food for less than these prices. Food is the only redeeming quality - calamari, lamb, and swordfish are excellent. Service was slow and amateurish. Prices are obscene for what you're getting vs. expecting. Stay away."}
{"text":"Arguably the best restaurant in Ville St. Laurent. This is my family's 'go to' spot. Amazing, fresh sea food. Be sure to get a shrimp cocktail. My family always gets a large greek salad, oyster mushrooms, and these amazing eggplant chips with tzatziki. For my main I highly recommend the swordfish, but the steak is also out of this world."}
{"text":"Great food, nice people, very personal staff - this is the key, its all personal. This is definitely a family Greek restaurant.
I had the grilled Tunisian octopus, grilled Greek sausage at the bar with an glass of wine.
The octopus was grilled to perfection! I was slightly crisp on the outside and gave it a slightly smokey flavor, not overdone, very tender.
The grilled Greek sausage was excellent! Salty, nicely seasoned and the were texture elements to it.
To me, anyone can learn to grill meats or fish, it takes talent to make sauces or braise. I didn't really see too much in this area. This is why I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I live in the VSL, so I've been here numerous times. I have never been disappointed here. The food is consistently excellent. It's a Greek seafood restaurant with amazing Greek salad, fried calamari, jumbo shrimp, fresh fish, and the list goes on.

I would say this is arguably the best restaurant in Saint-Laurent. The food is excellent, and the prices reasonable. Nuff said!

Reservations are recommended on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Been there a few times and was not disappointed. Zucchini chips with tazikii sauce is a must! Mediterranean authentic food! Great atmosphere where you can carry a great conversation!! Homemade yogurt is the best I have had!!"}
{"text":"if your looking for fresh fish, fantastic lamb chops, and absolutely decadent entrees look no further than Elounda. It's by far one of the best Greek restaurants in Montreal. If you love seafood prepared in the traditional Greek way you have to make a stop at Elounda."}
{"text":"Ok looking restaurant 
Prices that don't match what your served
Plates didn't look anything like pictures other yelpers have posted. 
Elounda special 24$ a small amount of fried zucchini, fried eggplant, 2 spoons of taztziki and the tiniest amount of saganaki I have ever been served. 
Loukanika 1 sausage grilled that's not worth more than 7$ 
Greek salad was tasty but not worth the price 
Chicken 30$ 1 chicken breast and a handful of fries. 
Make money charge what you need to stay in business but make sure the customer gets what they are paying for."}
{"text":"5 star for food, 0 star for menu pricing and 4 stars for service. Using the term overpriced is an understatement. Just order the apps and you will know what I'm talking about. Over $30 for a grilled octopus entré, seriously? $80 for a fish? It's a shame since many will never discover how great the food tastes because the sticker shock will drive them away at the door."}
{"text":"Words that come to mind : fresh. Quality. Authentic.

Food : by far the best seafood I've had in this city. The menu had a wide variety of seafood/fish and each platter is better than the other. I've always said that food of good quality never needs to be over spiced or fancied up. We ordered a little bit of everything and nothing disappointed. The oysters tasted like the sea, they were large and super fresh, amazing. The stuffed calamari is definitely something new for me and I really enjoyed it. The Elounda special, which is a tower of zucchini, eggplant and saganaki (fried cheese) with delicious tzatziki is a great option for nibblers like myself. The fried anchovies are simply addictive, I definitely recommend you try them. But my absolute favourite was the octopus. I've had my fair share of octopus and it was cooked to perfection here. 
The dessert (those honey ball things...:/) was great and the Greek coffee was a delight.

Service/staff : A+. I love the fact that the owner is present and active in his restaurant. He had a great energy. The whole staff really, from our delightful waitress who suggested the wine to the guys who bring water and bread, was great.

Decor/ambiance : the decor isn't out of a Home&Garden magazine, but it's quaint. Everything was very clean (including the bathrooms).

Note : I've read people complain about the prices, but really, I don't see what the problem is. A lot of things are market price and the portions are very fair.

Suggestion : if you want several appetizers, ask for half portions."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my boss at Elounda.   Had the Tuna Tartar and Greek Salad to start which were good.  Tried the Grilled Octopus which is their specialty, but found it not the best.  Finished off with loukoumades for desert."}
{"text":"The only eatable restaurant in saint Laurent. One of my favourite in Montreal. Must try their house special tzaziki. Never get enough. I don't know if others notice, their bread taste sooooo good. U can actually buy one loaf of it. Don't try their sea bass. It is plain. Try tuna, and salmon. The cheesecake was made of ricotta in Greek style. Must try. A bit pricy but it is authentic."}
{"text":"Let me just say... This places serves up a great experience. I stopped in on a Tuesday evening after having flown in from New Mexico.  I sat up at the bar (which was more of a server area - not really for public seating) and they were very accommodating. Not being very Privy to quality seafood from my home State, I elected to indulge on their seafood offering - assuming I couldn't go wrong.  After talking with the owner, Gary, who was very polite and professional, he suggested I try the grilled squid, seared scallops and their house made Caesar salad.  The squid was grilled perfectly and the dressed in a homemade onion and caper vinegarette - amazing. The scallops were perfectly seared and served up In again, another amazing homemade sauce. The Caesar was extremely good. Most Caesars today are so \"vanilla\" - it's just so easy to out a generic Caesar dressing on the salad from SYSCO, shamrock, Ben and Keith's...etc but they, ventured out into the \"verboten\" and made their own dressing. Creamy, delicious, raw and full of flavor - God bless them!!!  I'd highly recommend this place and a go-to on the northern side of town. Thanks Gary for a great experience - best of luck to you!"}
{"text":"Wow, 

I haven't been blown away by the quality of food in quite some time!  

I came here on a business lunch with 5 other people and one in my group is Greek by origin so he took the lead by ordering for us!  

For appetizers, we ordered the Elounda special which was so amazing and tasty!  Crispy and lightly seasoned but so great in tasting!  As well with this there was a side of Tzatziki plus a red pepper-cheese spread.  Then some nice lightly fried Calamari.  The Calamari was amazing.... so light and crispy!   Then onto the next a huge chunky greek salad and as well some bread.  By this time I was feeling lightly full and ready to leave.

Then came to our table the most appetizing mixed grilled shared plate I've seen in my life!  This was huge jumbo shrimp grilled, the most tender chicken, some grilled lamb, with fries and potatoes.  Then they brought out some vegetables, rice and some more fries!  Take a look at my photo but it doesn't do justice because this was enough food for 6 hungry guys!  

If you look at their menu they have one of the most solid seafood selections I would claim in Montreal.  Amazing selection!    

Decor of the place is nothing amazing....like an old neighbourhood Greek restaurant but the food is insanely good!  All was very lightly seasoned but so mouth watering and flavourful!"}
{"text":"My boss where I use to work at a pharmacy brought us all for Christmas supper and the food was delicious the owner is a funny Greek guy who likes to converse with customers but it's part of his job for birthday parties is the best!!"}
{"text":"I'm so full I can hardly type this review, but it was such a great meal that I won't even wait to digest! Elounda is a family style Greek restaurant with warm and friendly staff and a full house on a Saturday night. Expect more large and loud table atmosphere than intimate and quiet, which is perfect for Greek in my opinion. 
We had the Elounda special as an appetizer. This is not to be missed. Thinly sliced fried zuchini and eggplant with saganaki cheese and tzaziki. Delicious! 
Then I had the chicken and shrimp plate. It was great but the shrimp was a bit overcooked. No biggie since the plate came with two chicken breasts that were amazing. 
Finally we had the loukomades  (not sure if that's the proper spelling) but they are Greek style deep fried dough balls covered in honey. Apparently you can get a half order which I would suggest if you're a smaller party because you get about 9 balls in a full order and they are not for the faint of heart. Luckily we were able to take the rest to go so tomorrow's breakfast is covered!
The service was also great. Fast, friendly and professional with a familiar touch."}
{"text":"It's an imitation of Milos... Literally.
I don't appreciate people stealing ideas in the restaurant business... At least have the decency to change the dishes' names!
That being said, the appetizers are very good.
The main dishes are a disaster. 
My husband had the steak and it was mostly just fat for 49$. He wasn't able to eat it.
My sister had the chilean sea bass. She took a bite and sent it back... Smelled horrible. The waitress was super rude about it! 
I had the salmon. Just average. 
I went a few times to this restaurant and every time, you have to cross your fingers that the food will be edible. At that price, it's completely unacceptable.
The bus boys are all nice, but the waitresses and the hostess are consistently rude... Very rude. 
So many better options in Montreal, please avoid."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, you want a great piece of fish and good food overall? Don't care too much if the place looks a little out dated? I travel often and get to visit now restaurants. This place had one of the best pieces of Chilean Bass I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Always a great place to have authentic Greek food. Fish selection is nice. My favorite is the lamb chops, melts in your mouth. A bit pricey but worth it. Service is always top."}
{"text":"Fish --- excellent!  But the most well-kept secrets are the 20 oz rib steak and veal chop. No doubt the best in the city."}
{"text":"I give this resto 5 

We often do family parties ! Been long time dinning at Elounda ! Amazing quality also know the owners down to earth people. We met them while back when they purchased their Ceramics for the resto. (Royal Ceramics).
