{"text":"I love Chik fil a's, but I was overwhelmed by a terrible smell when I walked in here today. Gross. And the bathrooms were full and garbage overflowing. We walked out without ordering.
This was from November 2012."}
{"text":"I'm giving three stars because I love Chick-fil-A, in general, and until the last few months, this location has been perfectly fine. However, I haven't been going to this one lately because of how bad it was the last few times I went. I got chicken nuggets that tasted horrible. How can you ruin chicken nuggets? I got a salad that was significantly smaller than usual and contained wilted lettuce. I don't even think it was the same type of lettuce usually used in that salad. Worst of all, the service wasn't good in the drive-thru, and good service is usually a cornerstone of any Chick-fil-a. The last time I went through the drive-thru was on a weekend. It appeared that only teenagers were working and there were many of them. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but it took forever to get through the drive-thru. I've seen them get two long lines of cars through in no time, but not this time. While I was waiting in the line of cars, I suddenly heard yelling. Apparently two young employees were arguing by the open door between the ordering speaker and the window. I got to listen to that go unchecked for awhile in the slow moving line. When we finally got to the window, there were probably 10 teenagers standing around chatting about their love lives and various other things, but nobody was standing at the window to take my money or give me my order. There was one young lady who was trying to get everyone to work, but she was being ignored. Finally, the one person doing any work got our order together and took my money and gave me my food. After all that, they forgot my honey mustard sauce! My suggestion would be to have a responsible adult member of management work on the weekends, because the kiddos aren't managing themselves."}
{"text":"I always get great service from this store. It's been open since I think around 2003, maybe 2004. I've never had bad food from here. It is a chain, so the food is what you'd expect from a Chick-fil-a. It deffinitely costs more than a chicken sandwich from McDonald's, but I find the spicy chicken sandwiches from Chick-fil-a to be the best fast food sandwich you can get. Just make sure to pick your sauce separately. I had a friend who always complained about them being dry because he didn't know they don't put sauce on there, you get it on the side. After he knew that, he started eating there regularly.

It is fast food though, so don't expect a life changing experience."}
{"text":"This location has great service and as always the food is great. The only thing is the play area. I have been here on so many different occasions that I'm disappointed to have to say that time and time again the play equipment is disgusting. The room always has a nasty urine odor to it. But it's the actual climbing equipment that has made me not allow my kids to come and play anymore. Every time they start climbing their hands, knees and feet end up black from grime. The slide is so gross and sticky you can't even slide down it. I'm not sure what the cleaning requirements are for these types of areas but something desperately needs to be reevaluated and fixed. I understand that lots of kids play throughout the day, but it is just unacceptable to have such a filthy play area.  
I hope they can get higher standards of cleanliness established as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Seem to remember it tasting better when visiting in South Carolina. Was disappointed by it when this store opened in Madison."}
{"text":"Always a very friendly staff.  When one of my visits took a little longer than anticipated the comped my bill.  Excellent experience and customer service."}
{"text":"Carleen was amazing. She greeted me with a smile as soon as I walked in. She immediately went to a register and asked me if she could help me. She was GENUINELY very engaging and interested in how my day was going. Upon paying and receiving my order she thanked me and asked me to return soon. 

While I was sitting my meal, a toddler was crying and the parents were trying to pacify him, but were unable to. Carleen observed from behind the counter. She brought over a small toy for the child  which made him stop crying. The parents were delighted and thanked her. She didn't have to do anything, but she did. It's great to see brand representatives do nice things for customers because they want to...not because it's their job or want to be noticed doing it. Bravo Carleen...Bravo!!!!"}
{"text":"My 1st visit to Chick-fil-A.  And my sons were right. .. FIRE...IT IS VERY GOOD.  The police out here directing the traffic so the line moved very fast."}
{"text":"Great place. Best indoor playset."}
{"text":"We love Chick-fil-A, but coming here was like we entered the Twilight Zone. How can the crew be so wonderful everywhere else and so rude, unfriendly, unkempt here?!?!  We were the only car in the Drivethru and no-one would acknowledge us for a five minutes...then a car pulled up in the other lane and got served before us!!!!  When I mentioned that all I got was a blank stare...NO apology at all!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Chick-Fil-A as it always rank highly amongst US fast food chains. I happened to be in the Calgary airport recently where I'm told has the only Chick-Fil-A restaurant in Canada so I decided to try it out. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. Who knows, maybe I just expected more. I mean, it was good but not great."}
{"text":"I came 2 min after breakfast and was disappointed they had stopped serving breakfast at 10:30. I was craving the little chicken biscuits. The owner bent over backwards to take care of me and gave the the little chicken biscuits even though I missed the breakfast hours. What amazing service especially in this day when companies so often don't have good customer service. I frequently go to this location and have always been pleasantly surprised even when I am having a bad day they lighten the mood with their positivity and amazing food. This will continue to be my restaurant of choice for years to come!!!! Great food and exceptionally amazing service."}
{"text":"What a crappy Chick-fil-A. It used to be one of the better ones to go to around Charlotte, but now.....nope! The floor and tables stay dirty, even when they're slow. Management needs to re-evaluate what keeps his doors open, and being a jerk about Whipped Cream on kids' ice dream cones is ridiculous! Yeah, that's right, you're seriously the only Chick-fil-A that is trying to charge for whipped cream. Customers vote with their feet, and you just lost me as a customer!"}
{"text":"This location is the best in Charlotte!  Of course the food is perfect, it's the staff that makes this location stellar.  Everyone spoke clearly and politely.  Everything was clean and neat.  And most amazingly, they keep the drive-thru moving smoothly.  
If it was closer, I would go every week.
Way to go Woodlawn Chick-fil-a!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a food is always good.  The service is what is at issue - it appears that the staff \"caters\" to the drive-thru and keeps the customers that come into the store taking a \"backseat\"."}
{"text":"Worst Chick-fil-A I've n the area. 
I went to this location because they are usually on point and super friendly!  I went to the drive thru today since it did not appear to be super busy.  I had to repeat myself 3 times. That should have been my first clue that something was off. I get the same thing every time I go her and it has never been an issue.  When I get to the window. Some guy with a man bun yells I'll be with you in a minute.  Not friendly at all. No eye contact... after he distributed a few orders he finishes up to help me. Dude seems like he is already grumpy... than I watch him reach into a cooler and grab a container. Not at all where my order usually comes from. I asked for a chicken wrap with spicy chicken. Again, this has never been an issue at any location including this one. He than rolls his eyes at me and goes to the back. He returns to inform me that \"it is not their policy to put anything into the food, only to take it out.\" Why, when I placed my order was I not informed of this??? If I had been mentioned something to I would have ordered something different. I was handed my bag and he proceeded to start to walk away. Basically, he didn't care. I still said thank you. And I did not get a \"my pleasure\"!!! No napkins in the bag....  I will not go back here!!!! You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I like chick fil a. It's always tasty! 
But the reason I'm giving this chick fil 5 starts, it's because of the people that work here! Not ONCE have I walked into this one and come across a person unhappy!!! Last night when I went through the drive thru everybody was sooooooooooooooo happy and made my night!
Thank you all for being amazing & awesome! The people that work here are why I will keep coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chick-fil-A in my opinion (closely followed by Willoughby) the food is always great and I've never had them mess up an order. The service is the best part, everyone that works here is super accommodating and nice."}
{"text":"My order was pretty simple, 1 large waffle fry to go.  In the time that it took the cashier (Kenny as this is the name on the receipt) to turn around and tell the young lady that he needed a large fry and bag my order, several things took place.  The first he had to repeat it several times because the young lady was not paying attention.  Then he proceeded to scratch his nose, more than once and began digging in his ear.  While he proceeded to take another order the young lady (which I later learned was the manager on duty) was looking/playing on her cell-phone, touching it as well as playing with her long blondish brown hair.  She proceed to scoop the fries into the box and the ones that began falling out, she caught with her hand and placed them back in the box.  At this point I was disgusted and decided that I no longer wanted the fries.  When Kenny returned  with the fries in the bag he apologize!
d for the wait and I politely told him that I wanted a refund.  He never asked why, he just says that he would need a manager to do so.  He told the young lady that I had observed playing with her hair and phone that he needed to refund an order.  She came upfront and refunded my money, again never asking why.  I was very dismayed at the  very health habits each one of them displayed as I hold Chick-fil-A to a higher standard than that of other fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"This review is based on my visit on August 7th, 2015.

I stopped by this location on the way home after not having eaten Chick-fil-A for many years! I used the drive thru, which had a very short line, likely due to the stormy weather outside. I ordered the chicken nuggets with waffle fries and got some of the Polynesian sauce on the side. I had to eat soggy and cold food once I got home, but that's no fault of the restaurant - that's my fault for picking a Chick-fil-A so far from home! The food was good, I love waffle fries! I would definitely come back here in the future."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to grab a quick meal but since the major turn over of employees it's gone down hill. The new folks are So rude!!!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the quality of good and friendly service I receive when I go into a chickfil-a.  This location is always fast,  friendly,  and my order is always correct.  They have always been inviting to both my daughter and I.  Always clean inside and out!"}
{"text":"Best Chick Fil A in Pittsburgh.  Staff are very friendly and accommodating.  If you have a choice in which one you stop at, make it this one."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chic-fil-a. This location can get busy, but there is never a weight for fresh and fast food.

Staff is friendly, courteous, and always greet you with a smile. The food is delicious and I recommend the strawberry milkshake."}
{"text":"Went to this Chick-fil-A yesterday specifically for receipt day (where you bring in your receipt in January to get all of the items on your receipt for free) and did not get a receipt for my order. Have my credit card charge to prove it. I sent a message to the restaurant, they read it, but didn't reply back. My family and I eat at this Chick-fil-A often, but won't be coming back because of this. Way to scam people!"}
{"text":"Food is fine...standard CFA. Service is weak. The GM, David, doesn't impress me. My order was messed up during the grand opening. I didn't notice until I got home when we opened the food to eat. I called to let them know, not that I cared about the $.30 price differential that erred in their favor, but about the principle. If I have to pay for cheese, I at least want to get the cheese, or whatever the case is. I was stuck between two people on hold, and David, the GM, came on but had put me on another hold. I had stuff going on and had to go. He called back, and apologized for the inconvenience and offered to send me a gift card. I didn't want to have them hassle with sending me a gift card, I just wanted (since he called back) to adjust my meal on the next visit to compensate for the error the first time. He says come in next time I am here, ask to talk to David, and he will make it right and comp the meal. Okay great. 

I come in a few weeks later, tell my story to the order taker lady, get a look like I'm crazy, and the lady I talk to goes and talks to David, in front of me. I place my order, told the story, and then there was an awkward wait while the lady talked to the GM. I don't like feeling awkward so I said don't even worry about it, all I originally wanted was to get this $.30 cheese taken care of, and the person taking my order couldn't figure out how to do that. So I said don't worry about it, just let me pay the full price and be done with it. Well I could hear and see David and the other lady talking, again like I was crazy. I told the lady I can tell David himself the story since he was right there getting it second hand now from this other lady. He clearly didn't remember by her telling the story what had happened and what he had told me. Finally I got to pay and be done. Food came out. It was fine, but they still got the order wrong (I ordered no pickles, twice in fact since they had to redo my order).  

I came out of my way to visit this place again. I hate being wronged, calling them on it, and feeling like I'm the bad guy by their actions and the way they handled this situation. All over $.30 cents that I originally didn't even care about, other than wanting to let them know and maybe get the cheese comped the next time since I paid for it once and never got it. 

If the GM tells me to drop his name, ask to talk to him so he can deliver on righting the situation, I expect that. If I follow up, and then I'm the bad guy for doing what he says, well that's not how customer service works. Canes is right down the road, and there's another CFA I will drive a little further to go to."}
{"text":"Charity and Amanda are the best! They really know how to provide great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this chickfila on Tatum 2 stars is because chickfila's food is so good. BUT this chickfila is so poorly run! If you go through the drive thru expect to wait at least 10 min. Do not go when you are in a hurry. It is so slow. Also they rarely get your order correct and you MUST check your order, including your drink, before pulling away. This chickfila needs some help with speed and accuracy, it is not run like all the other chickfila's that I have visited through the years"}
{"text":"Was there today at 6:15 really not crowded but fries were just warm. Also most of the tables were dirty.Lots of finger prints all over the glass. Very unusual thus disappointed !"}
{"text":"This is my boys ' favorite place to come,  so this is our tradition to come here for breakfast together for something special between mom and sons. Food and service are always good and consistent"}
{"text":"best chick-fil-a in the world. also fast and accurate, and most of all always polite. if your in the afton ridge area of concord this is a must stop to eat......"}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, Chick-fil-A, is generally pretty okay! The food is not always super fresh, but it is tasty and their lemonade is absolute to die for. Of course it's a little on the unhealthy side, but it's fantastic, and my kids are huge fans of their kids meals. However, the facilities are not always clean (especially the bathrooms) and the orders are wrong pretty frequently. Otherwise, generally good experience"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of their food but their service is spectacular. All the employees I've encountered are incredibly friendly. I usually don't order food; I just pick up a lemonade. I LOVE that lemonade! But if you are ordering food, the chicken sandwich is doable."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a movie date and decided to go to Chick-Gil-A for lunch before we went grocery shopping.  We weren't thinking about the school noontime rush as we pulled in to the parking lot.  There were several people ahead of us but the line moved quickly.  As we were waiting for our food the rush started and the line was out the door and across the parking lot (we had our food in less than  5 minutes). Again, the line moved quickly and soon there wasn't a line.  The entire rush staff was around the dining area chatting with customers and clearing tables.  I was truly impressed at the friendliness of staff and the quality of food.  We will definitely be back.  
Great job staff"}
{"text":"You want a real chicken sandwich, none of these nasty fake filled other chicken sandwiches from fast food chains. look no further chick fil a has the best around. with premium chicken breast meat with no hormones or other additives. tasty white meat that never disappoints. the staff is friendly the place is always clean. the only downfall is they're not open on Sundays :'("}
{"text":"So I work right across the street and My husband and I decided to try. We love the breakfast sandwiches. Their very good. We actually just came from there this morning and although they messed up our order and we had to go back inside the manager (I believe) asked me right away what happened and corrected our order right away. Got our sandwiches within 2 minutes and we kept the wrong ones as well. Even though we shouldn't of had to go inside, I was really impressed with how fast my order was corrected."}
{"text":"Genuinely friendly employees. Fast food that doesn't taste like fast food. What I really like, though, is that the kids meals come with books!  And they even have board books for kiddos under 3! If you have a smaller appetite, you could order the kid's meal for yourself and then give the book to your kid.  Win-win!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this location is the big, enclosed children's play area.  There's a big Purell hand wipes dispenser just outside the door, so if you're a little bit skittish about kids play areas, you can always wipe your kids down before and after playing.

As with other locations, this one has good food and friendly service.  The sodas are not self-serve, but there is always someone walking around making sure your food is okay and checking to see if you'd like refills."}
{"text":"The worst Chic fil A on the planet.   I am glad they give you their great Christian values because they rarely deliver what every other location in the chain does without issue.  The GM of this location has to be as dysfunctional as his employees.

Sincerely,
My Pleasure!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and the employees are very friendly and the food is always delicious.. tonight I was thrown for a loop and pretty put out to be honest. I ordered the spicy ck sandwich meal with no bun. She asked if I wanted it as a wrap and I said no thanks just as it comes with the regular amount of lettuce. I was upcharged for letting them keep their bun. I asked the cashier why and she said that's just how they do it. That even when ppl ask for no lettuce they charge them the upcharge. How jacked up is that??"}
{"text":"3 stars for this location because it's the slowest chickfila I've ever been too!   

Went on a Monday (President's day) during lunch and they had 3 people nonchalantly working the cashiers, one poor girl running all over the place manning the drive through, a few people slowly making food in the back and no one filling the orders.

Really feel like the staff are not being managed efficiently.

Most chickfila's are super super efficient.  There's several I know that have a complex system to get the drive thru customers in and out during busy lunch hours.

Food - 5 stars of course!  Chick Fil A is also delicious!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hampton Inn next door. I called and ordered delivery on a salad and a drink. 

They were prompt and friendly . The chicken was steaming hot and the salad was prepared exactly how I wanted it.

they came right to my door within 15 min with the food."}
{"text":"Wow, i love chic fil a so much lol , but this morning was especially delicious because im sure like every other chic fil la lover out there i wanted it so bad yeasterday lol but i had it thise morning and was blown back, i just had the usual but it was so fresh and satisfying, there smiles brightened my morning which was needed and i honestly wanna go there for lunch again... today lol"}
{"text":"I feel like chic fil a is a little pricy but usually worth it as the food and service are excellent.  This was my first visit to this location & I only went because of the free iced coffee promotion.  I asked before I ordered if I could have the iced coffee and the cashier replied\"my pleasure\".  I was with my two small kids, I took our food to the table & she said she would bring the coffee out.  She came to the table & told me they were out of the medium iced coffee cups so I couldn't have the coffee.  I said a small would be fine or I didn't care what cup it was in and she clarified \" no, my manager said you can't have the coffee since we are out of the medium iced coffee cups\" oooookay. . .i thanked her, she was professional & polite.  I didn't argue with anyone since it sounded final but I feel so cheated.  They advertised this and I asked before I ordered. . .they were not out of the coffee & there were plenty of other cups in the restaurant it would have been easy to honor their ad & what they told me before I ordered.  My expectation of chic fil a is that they always go out of their way to do the right thing but that was not the case at this location today.  I really wish I had gone somewhere with a dollar menu. . .if I had known they were not going to honor their ad or if they would have just told me that before I ordered I would have gone next door & spent half as much.  Since they did have the coffee I feel like they were just looking for any excuse not to honor their advertising.  I'm very disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"I Love Chick-Fil-A. Just returned from the USA and the food quality at the Calgary Airport Chick-Fil-A is as good as the USA locations. I wish the menu was bigger but the location is small. I like to take my youngest daughter there for something different. Keep it up Chick-Fil-A."}
{"text":"Don't anger the employees or they'll throw your food in a bag haphazardly and make you wait until your food is cold *cough* Austyn *cough*"}
{"text":"I love this location, the problem is that it gets soooo busy here it has an effect on the quality of food being made. The line to the drive-through gets 20-30 cars deep at peak lunch and dinner hours. I've been here about five times total and twice my food has been a bit undercooked.

I know it recently opened, but by now the kinks should have been worked out. If I had to choose, I'd go to the Chik-fil-a at 31st Ave and Beardsley instead of this."}
{"text":"I usually never write a review on fast food chains unless they are exceptionally good or just that bad.  I'm writing because the experience at a chick fil a is far far superior to any other fast food chains.  Your always dealt with in a courteous and cheerful manner by everyone.  I have never ran into a Mc job attitude at chick fil a.   Why don't the other chains take the chick fil a training manual for its employees ??  I am always impressed with my experienc.   Ok food.  It's fast food. So what can I say ??? It is what it is.  I go there for the superior service."}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-a!!!
Im a huge fan! 
I usually get a number one (original chicken sandwich combo) with a sweet tea. If Im in the mood to be somewhat healthy I get the grilled chicken sandwich. Their honey mustard is really good too...my favorite kind from any fast food. 
I just ate at this particular one today and had excellent service. The  lady that was helping me was really sweet. She just seemed happy to be there and in a good mood unlike other places. She even gave me a free breakfast sample (a sausage biscuit) since it was right after breakfast hours. I have never got this from any place before. It was a nice gesture. I didnt try it though, I just saved it for my boyfriend...he said it was really good though (and it was reheated)"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is so damn good. Get a shake! They're worth it."}
{"text":"I heart Chick-Fil-A. I almost said the waffle fries are the best part, but that would be a lie. The cookies and cream shake is. Actually, the chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and cookies and cream shake are all the best part."}
{"text":"There is no greater fast food restaurant than Chick Fil A. As a guy who's eaten at a lot of fast food restaurants over the years, I can say this without question. I used to eat their scrumptious chicken nuggets at their old location at Metrocenter mall when I was little, and I have had a love for their food ever since. If you love chicken as much as I do, you will be hard-pressed to find a better recipe. They know how to prepare chicken better than anyone. The use of peanut oil to fry their chicken makes it healthier and much less greasy than their competitors. Throw in a fantastic mix of herbs and spices, incredible waffle fries, a wide variety of condiments, and homemade lemonade, and you have yourself the most fantastic meal you'll ever get at a fast food establishment. Whether you go for one of their sandwiches, the nuggets, or the breakfast items, the chicken is without equal. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome Awesome. Love the chicken sandwich. Love the honey roasted barbecue sauce. I wish they hadn't gotten rid of the cookie sundae. :("}
{"text":"Great food. Wish they had croutons for their salads. Wish they had more dessert options. Love the honey roasted barbecue sauce. They soooo need to bottle it and sell it."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Chick Fil A since I was a little kid. It is my go to restaurant when I choose to do fast food. I decided to stop by this new location for a breakfast burrito. Unlike all of my encounters at other Chick Fil A's, this time was different. I went in and ordered a breakfast burrito. Most of the time, I get my orders fairly quickly when I go to other locations, which is what is expected at a fast food restaurant. First, it took them 15 minutes to give me my burrito. When I received it, the inside contents were cold. So I asked if they could just heat it up, which would of been fine with me. The employee apologized and notified the kitchen staff. I overheard the kitchen staff questioning why it would be cold and how that was impossible. Nonetheless, they finally took it back. I waited an additional 15 minutes to get a new one. So at this point, I've been there for over 30 minutes just to get a breakfast burrito. After the 15 minutes went by I asked for my burrito. I was finally given a new one. This time, the chicken inside was cold, the cheese is not melted and there was NO EGG. I ordered a breakfast burrito and it had no egg?? I asked why and their answer was the kitchen has turned off the machine that makes the eggs since they are serving lunch now. You would think, it would be common sense that you tell the customer if you are out of something before you serve it to them. It's like when I order a burger and giving me a bun with tomatoes and lettuce only, then telling me they are out of meat. How is that even acceptable for a franchise that is known for their amazing customer service??? So finally an employee came over and apologized for their service. She continued to tell me that they are new and they are young kids, so they don't know what good customer service was. I also let her know that there is no reason for their service to be slow seeing that there are 6 employees working the front area and business was slow. She reported this back to an employee and they said out loud that they are short staffed and how they are unable to work efficiently when they don't have enough staff. If add anymore staff in that area, there would be no room to work efficiently. I looked in their lobby and there was one customer and some in line in the drive thru. Then another staff member came by to offer me another item since they don't have breakfast anymore. I ordered a sandwich this time. The person who came to ask me this forgot to put the order in, so that was an additional 10 minutes. At this point, I just wanted to see how bad my experience can get. I notified the manager and he offered me a free meal if I gave them another try at a different time. Least to say I will be taking advantage of this offer as I will not be returning to this location.I have 2 other locations close to me that I will give me the service that every paying customers deserves. I hope they can change their process there so they can be just like the other  Chick Fil A's that everyone loves."}
{"text":"Fine restaurants, with good breakfast items, but TaylorStreet location doesn't open until 10:00!  Weird decision?!?"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Courteous employees.  Clean restaurant.  A welcome break on a long road trip."}
{"text":"This was also my first Chick-Fil-A experience. Delicious! 

Chicken sandwich was great. Went with the fruit cup instead of fries (though the waffle fries looked awesome, if I ate another french fry that week my heart would have hit its ejection seat button) which I pleasantly surprised me. First fruit cup in a while that didn't use any honeydew/cantaloupe as filler. And the sweet tea was the sweetest I had during my trip to Charlotte.

C-F-A, come to Chicago anytime.

Anytime."}
{"text":"The bells in my stomach were ringing as I was looking for a quick bite to grab. I stopped by this Chick-fil-A for a drive thru when I saw the crowd in the parking lot and was very curious to understand what was going on. I am new in the area so I am not sure if this location recently opened or had renovation but everyone was dressed like a cow! and eating free! Unfortunately my dress code did not qualify for the free meal but I enjoyed the freshly made grilled chix sandwich. All great ingredients and I like Chicks!"}
{"text":"Is this place ever not packed?!  Every one I've ever been to has been practically SRO.  We snagged a table and had our order taken pretty quickly.  I had the Spicy Chicken Deluxe and it was very good.  Of course, I couldn't skip the waffle fries and the lemonade (diet for me) - it's all part of the CFA experience.  Overall, the food is good but it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"One pickle? Received a calendar for Christmas from my mother-in-law....you receive one free item per month. January was the chicken sandwich. I have never eaten at chick-fil-a but one pickel? Tasty chicken but dry sandwich. Most of the rest of the months are free soda...should be safe there."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A will always get 5 stars. Although I understand the reasoning behind being closed on Sundays, I am still disappointed at only having 6 days a week to enjoy the deliciousness that is Chick-Fil-A."}
{"text":"So this isn't the first time this happens at this specific place. They forget an item and I have to drive back to get it what the heck am I supposed to do tell  my niece ugh ur going to have to wait to eat because those 6-7 employees standing around didn't get out order right NO I went back and got those nuggets with absolutely no compensation ... oh and to add the icing on the cake just got home and my food is cooked they didn't ask me hey can we remake ur food so it's not cold NOPE they did not sooo frustrated"}
{"text":"Alway great service, love to stop by whenever we are in the area. We need more people like this in all fast food places and bonus the chicken is good too."}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A and was so happy to find one so close to where I live in north Scottsdale!!!

I go to this Chick-Fil-A often and have never been disappointed!  I always get an 8 count and a large fry, sometimes a chocolate shake if I'm not counting calories that day :)

Their nuggets are delicious and they offer every kind of dipping sauce you could think of.  They serve waffle fries, which if you ask me there are no better fast food fries out there!!!  And their shakes are amazing! So rich and creamy just wish they were guilt free!!

I like keeping my hands cleans and appreciate the abundance of sanitizers throughout the shop!

The staff is always so friendly and courteous and are willing to go the extra mile to make their customers happy.

If you are in the north Scottsdale area and looking for quality quick chicken definitely check this place out, you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience. It a shame they are considered \"fast food\" because they are 1,000 times better than the competition!"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, good food.  New egg white grill was very good and health wise.  Good cup of coffee to go with it.  Not your normal worn out fast food place. Lot's of competition in area, but this is a better choice for overall fast food experience."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Chic-Fil-A. The food is more consistent than half the restaurants in the area for a fraction of the price. I would and could eat here everyday. They also have absolutely phenomenal customer service."}
{"text":"I was helped by Matt (I think he was the manager) who was incredibly pleasant despite it being a busy night. After I sat down, he brought my food to me (most jut hand it to you over the counter) and even asked me before I was finished if everything tasted good. What service! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-a but I was really disappointed when I bough a large fruit cup and got a small plus when I opened it, all the fruit was not fresh it. They were all nasty apples and other fruits... don't recommend the fruit cups here."}
{"text":"Food cold. Girl at window had no personality. Couldn't tell sweet tea dei half and half."}
{"text":"Smallest chicken sandwich ever. Only chick fil a without a law enforcement discount:("}
{"text":"Consistent, fresh food. Love the breakfast biscuits. Not a fan of the coffee. Hopefully they can improve on that. The staff is always friendly. Love the \"you're welcomes\" and \"my pleasure\" responses they give. Very refreshing. Can get free beverage refills, you just have to ask."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place. Service is so bad and rude cashier. Her name is Mykol, she is so rude and no educated. Also she couldn't take order.
Service is so bad, do not go there."}
{"text":"Always great service at this location. The food is always cooked perfectly and is ready fairly quickly as well"}
{"text":"Fast food fried chicken with amazingly good service and even better waffle fries. This location is spotless inside and the workers are always very pleasant. Even during the long lines on a Saturday at lunch time, they get your order and food out quickly. Don't forget they close on Sundays."}
{"text":"Great environment and top quality customer service. I stopped in for a quick lunch with my son.  The place was packed full of people, but a manager was out of the floor refilling drinks and smiling! Great experience and great people!"}
{"text":"Quick drive thru service ! Even though the line was very long they moved it quickly and efficiently. Great food too! So glad to have a chick-fil-a in Vegas now ! Definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the worst Chick-fil-A that I've ever been to. My family and I love Chick-fil-A and would regularly drive to eat at one when there wasn't one nearby. 

First visit: Went through the drive-through. The employees were friendly, but the food was lukewarm. One of the best things about Chick-fil-A is that their food is always hot and fresh. Not so on that visit.

Second visit: Dined in. Another great thing about Chick-fil-A is that their restaurants are always clean and well-maintained. Again, not so. The tables were dirty and sticky. Also, our sandwiches and fries were lukewarm. The visit was disappointing and definitely not up to the usual Chick-fil-A standard.

Third visit: Went through the drive-through for breakfast. There were 3 or 4 cars ahead of us when we pulled up. For some reason, it took nearly 50 minutes to get our food. When we did get it, out of four items, one was wrong and one was burnt. In over a decade of eating at Chick-fil-A, I have never had burnt food from Chick-fil-A. I took the receipt and the two items inside to exchange them, and I asked to speak to the manager. The manager refused to speak with me and told the girl to tell me that he was too busy. This all happened about 10 feet away so I was able to see and hear the whole thing. There were 2-3 employees standing around who could have taken over bagging food, but he wouldn't speak to me. 

We haven't been back to the Surprise location and won't go back until some major changes are made."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  Awesome food. We drove all the way from East Mesa for the sweet tea. We came in on Saturday for lunch. I got the Cobb salad with the apple cider dressing and it was Awesome!!!  It was actually packed and not fluff to look full. The sandwiches, nuggets and of the tea was YUMMY!! Yumm yumm."}
{"text":"Service at this location has gone from bad to worse.  Sat in the inescapable drive thru only to get to window to find it was going to be additional 10 mins to get a salad!!!  Seriously???? You only do chicken - how can you not have at dinner time on a Sat night?  Especially when you see all the employees standing in there doing nothing.  Management needs to address ASAP!"}
{"text":"I love Chick fil A, but after moving to Gastonia and this being the closest location, it is definitely no longer a go-to choice. Always extremely busy with not as friendly-as-expected staff, but the worst is the size of the food! The nuggets are about half the size of other locations and the sandwich is closer to a quarter the size of most locations, as well as dry, slightly cold, and stringy. Never again!"}
{"text":"I lived in South Carolina for three years and ate at Chick-Fil-a twice a week, so I was very excited to see them come to Vegas! Went there for the first time at 11:00 today and was soooo disappointed! The nuggets are about 1/2 the size of the ones in SC and very dried out! The fries were also cold. I never had a bad meal from the one in SC. Hopefully Vegas management will get their act together! I will try them one more time and if it doesn't improve I will wait until I go down South to get my Chick-Fil-a fix!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here for breakfast. I ordered & drove off but my hash browns were not fresh. Drove all the way back waited for new hash browns and they were hot but still gross & greasy over cooked lil hash browns. I didn't eat them but didn't have it in me to complain again maybe they are just always like that."}
{"text":"I grew up on Chick-fil-A. It's been 20+ years since I ate here and ya know what?  Its exactly as I remember it...with a ton of new items. 

The Spicy sammie is really spicy. OMG I thought my throat was literally going to catch fire. It's definitely got a kick & beats Wendy's spicy sammie hands down. 

Use the app & order ahead. Careful driving through parking lot."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's meh but most of the time it's amazing!!!! We love the girl, Amber. She is always nice and always offering to take out tray! The play area is really cool but they need to make the glass soundproof because when we sit beside it, it gets really loud and annoying but overall they are the best fast food place ever!!!!"}
{"text":"This Chick-Fil-A is a crowded complete clusterf*** of Soccer moms. The drive Thru is the kind of nightmare that nightmares have. This place is seriously not that awesome for me to wait 10 plus minutes on some fast food. This place has poor management but at the same time I can see why these employees look so depressed....its because its a few of them against the whole GYSA soccer mom army. Its the perfect place for these soccer moms to take their little rugrats. Of course the waiting times are gonna be long. I'd much rather go to In-N-Out Burger, they may be crowded too but at least their drive thru is faster."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Their so happy and high energy! Made me in a good mood! Plus the food is great! Yummy time to eat!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff..super helpful... fast, fresh, and delicious. Stop there about 3 times a week. From breakfast to party trays, everything is wonderful."}
{"text":"The service by DeJ was perfection but it was another employee on a break that decided to not so silently laugh at my child because of his soccer shorts being bunched up in his jogging pants. She even had the audacity to hold her phone up as if she took a photo of it. She continued to laugh uncontrollably each time he was in front of her.  I didn't get her name but I know she wore glasses and had a ponytail (light brown hair). She was sitting with two other guys on a break. Luckily my husband convinced me to walk away from the situation because I was ready to catch a case. This is not the behavior I expect from Chick-Fil-A employees! The owner/manager needs to do a rehire of the staff there because I've never experienced such rudeness at any Chick-Fil-A location like this one!"}
{"text":"Worst possible experience ever at a Chick-fil-A. From the time we walked through the door the experience was horrible... started with an impatient cashier and progressed to open condiment packages in the self serve bin. By the time, we noticed that the packets were open, there was ketchup all over my hands and legs and the chairs. 
One of the other workers did come out and cleaned up the mess. When I attempted to use the bathroom to wash the mess off of my hands, I discovered that a code is required to open the bathroom door. Asked at the front counter for assistance, I was told to look for the code on the receipt, rather than assisting me.  

To top it off, after all the clean up our food was cold and the drink order was wrong

Last time I ever set foot in a Chick-fil-A!!!  Too bad that you can't give zero stars as a rating.  So much for Christian compassion.

{"text":"This is my local Chick-Fil-A that I live a mile away from and go to all the time. I arrived around 10:10AM to order breakfast and when I pulled up to the window 10 minutes later they could not get my debit card that I use everyday to swipe correctly. They had already given me my food and drink and asked me to give it back. After I pulled out of Chick-Fil-A, I called them to see if they would hold the order while I ran back home and got another card. They said they would make sure to hold it, asked what I had, and I reconfirmed my breakfast order with them. I arrived back to Chick-Fil-A around 10:35, told the person taking orders in person what had happened, waited in line another 10 minutes and when I arrived at the window she said they were no longer serving breakfast so I would need to choose something else. Frustrated for having just wasted 45 minutes of my Saturday trying to get breakfast I said no and drove away. 

I would suggest that this Chick-Fil-A revise their rules, especially for loyal customers, because saying \"Oh no problem that's no big deal\" and letting me leave with my breakfast the first time or even asking if I could come back later that day with a different payment method would have left me with such a better experience. Now they have lost my business completely. Chick Fil A Cotswold needs to have some training on how one bad experience can lose a customer for life...over a $4 breakfast..."}
{"text":"absolutely delicious food, sweet tea doesn't taste like tap water (unlike many of the other fast food joints around), amazingly fast and friendly service even though the drive-thru line was about 40 cars long with heavy police presence to direct traffic. dine-in line was out the door and around the side of the building as well. if you're trying to figure out how to get past all the road blocks, go in by babies-r-us and stay to the right side for drive-thru line. they certainly earned the 5 stars

I didn't know which sauces to get, so here's a list that may help from one of their employees listed by popularity:
https://li.st/catharuin/chick-fil-a-sauces-ranked-7NpvDUW4jCPHSI127k9eMj"}
{"text":"Breaded chicken sandwich.  Ate it and don't get the hype.      I can eat a frozen chicken patty from Costco and can fix it up to make it taste way better than this stale food."}
{"text":"I had 2 simple requests grilled nuggets (received regular) and no pickle on sandwich. Technically there was no pickle but there was plenty of pickle juice - they plucked the pickle off, but could totally taste it - yikes these guys!"}
{"text":"Last Thursday I was shopping at the mall and decided to take a break and get something to drink.  I walked up to the register and the cashier, who had a very sour expression, never acknowledged me. I placed my order and she rang it up and got my drink for me without saying a word.  She rudely shoved my drink at me. It was the strangest experience. I'm going to think twice before I go to this store again."}
{"text":"Just used the Chick-Fil-A One app to order dinner on the 2nd day at Eastern location. I highly recommend using this. A friend told me about it because he used it at lunch today and didn't have to wait. Even though there were long walk in & drive-thru lines. I ordered on my phone & walked right up to the pick up door and my order was ready in a 3 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Great food. Very clean, if you decide to eat in. This fast food chain even puts some restaurants to shame."}
{"text":"The best run chick fil a ive ever been to and I've been to over 50. And this is on chick fil a standards which is already better than other fast food! Whoever the girl who is the shift manager needs a raise. What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Though often extremely busy, if you manage to squeeze in you will not be disappointed by the quality of great American food. The taste is excellent and the service is great too. I normally don't gravitate toward fast food, but this certainly one restaurant worth the stop. Love it!"}
{"text":"What's not to like?  They have the best chicken anywhere -- breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The staff is always extremely friendly, and seem to really enjoy working there.  The drive thru is always extremely fast.  I've never been given an incorrect order, and I can't count the number of times I've been through the drive thru.  I won't go anywhere else for fast food chicken.  Why settle for less when there's Chick-fil-A?"}
{"text":"Why isn't this getting 5 stars. Chick-fil-a are awesome because they make you crave it as you drive by. Staff is always so cool. Drive thru is always packed during lunch time so expect to wait."}
{"text":"Every time I come here everybody is really nice and joyful! Food always comes out fast, and the workers are always there to give you what you need! We were helped by a nice girl named Miranda who refilled our drinks and even cleared our tray. Great place."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 10 times now and I've only encountered 1 problem.  I've always received the right food, and the times that I had to wait awhile were obviously because of the place being really busy.  At those times, I remember there being an apology and that was that!  So, everything runs smoothly here and expect the right food to come out, and that it will be pretty fresh.  The only qualm here is that the staff sometimes (about 20%) ((since i've been here 10 times)) has been weird and uncaring.  One time, I received my food to a singing voice (that was the weird one....which is not bad, but c'mon I just want some food).  The other time was uncaring and completely unprofessional.  The window was crowded with a couple of people just talking and carrying away with the closest guy's back to me (with the window open) until the food came, in which he gave a very insincere \"thanks\" with a fake smile and quickly continued back to his life-or-death conversation about the state of Louisiana or some crap like that.  That was just completely unprofessional, but then again, it's a well known drive-thru service so what do you expect.  That's the only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars but nevertheless, I'm a fan of this location."}
{"text":"Awesome! This is my favorite location in Arizona. The staff is always awesome and they handle the mass hysteria of people rather well. Can't wait to go back ! Their cobb salad is probably the only salad I like to eat haha"}
{"text":"Brand new and first visit was excellent.  Food was hot and tasty. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  We showed on family fun night and the kiddos were treated to games, balloons,  and a free desert.   Will definatly be returning soon."}
{"text":"I am an avid fan of chickfila and have to say that the Afton Ridge location goes above and beyond what's expected from regular fast food restaurants, or other chickfilas. I never have a problem with my order whenever I visit! 5/5 stars compared to other fast food restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"Good quality food, as with all their locations. 
Service at the inside counter was lacking. Employees seem to be most concerned about the drive in window orders. Waited at least 5 min. At counter for beverage refills, before being acknowledged."}
{"text":"If McDonalds is the Toyota Corolla of the fast food world, Chick-fil-A is the Rolls Royce or Range Rover.  Yes, you will pay a little bit more than the dollar menu options at McDonalds or Taco Bell, but the quality is also light years ahead.  Chick-fil-A has pioneered the chicken sandwich, and they do it better than anyone else in town... yes, even better than Bojangles.  And the Plaza location has their act together; every day, they get slammed with a hungry lunchtime crowd of bankers, Duke Energy-ers, etc, and they consistently manage to fill orders correctly, quickly, and tastily.  Their hours are a bit shortened compared to other locations, as they close at 4pm, but stop by for breakfast or lunch (or an afternoon ice dream or milkshake snack!), and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service! Always friendly. If you get a kids meal, turn the toy back on for a kids ice cream!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken! Brand new store that is easy to access from the road and has the trademark great customer service!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how nice these people are and that I am only the first one to leave a review! They opened the door for us, served our food, asked if we needed refills every once in a while, had fresh flowers and always had a smile. I really hope that never changes. Good job guys."}
{"text":"We had dinner here recently.  My husband pulled his phone out of his pocket and a VERY important, work related, security card fell out of the pocket.  He didn't know this happened and was in  panic the next morning when he couldn't find the card.  We searched the house and he realized it might have fallen out at Chick-fil-A.  I called and spoke to Grace.  She said they had the card.  Come to find out they had called my husband's employer and reported that they had found the card and then they locked the card i their safe!  What a blessing!!  The customer service at this place is awesome!  One of our sandwiches was kinda cold and they were very good to replace it with a fresh sandwich and then gave us a card for a free item.  They went above and beyond!  And, thank you Grace for asking me questions before releasing the card to me.  You are awesome!"}
{"text":"My place to go to  everytime I'm watching what I eat...LOVE this place! I like that they have something for everyone. My favorite is the chargrilled chicken wrap with some of their buffalo suace drizzled on top. When I'm not watching my waistline, I LOVE their hot crispy waffle fries. The bad thing is you must eat these bad boys up quick, because once they get cold, they don't taste quite the same. The banana shake is also bomb, but a total gut buster...still awesome though! Service here has always been super efficient and very friendly too. JOSH ROCKS!"}
{"text":"The food, staff, and cleanliness = 5 stars. People who give 1 star and rant about nonsense without any knowledge of the use of punctuation should be ignored."}
{"text":"I love this place. Waiting in line is horrible during lunch but the service is great! They even know your name!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was excellent. One of the employees was nice enough to come to my table and get me a refill w/o me asking for it. Great service!!!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the worst Chick-fil-A's I have visited!  

The set up (parking lot, the drive thru and lack of staffing) is ridiculous!!!

The drive-thru is very slow resulting in huge back ups on South Boulevard. Most Chick-fil-A's have at least two order-takers standing out in the drive-thru to expedite service. The wait time to get your food inside is just as long. 
If you are on your lunch hour, I would suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have a weakness for GOOD fast food. Culver's. In-n-Out. Cold Stone (does that count?). Well, the time has come to add Chick-Fil-A to that list. There are no words for how delicious their original chicken sandwich is. Toasted bread, surrounding a thick piece of chicken that is crispy on the outside, juicy and moist on the inside, paired with the best waffle fries I've ever consumed. No pickles for me, as I'm allergic, but oh dear lord. This place is my diet killer. A month-long health kick met it's end at the hands of this place. I don't even realize I've stopped till I'm sitting there at the booth with my food being brought to me by a friendly, smiling employee. Forgive me, my body, but this will forever be my sin. Delicious, delicious sin."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The chicken and waffle fries are always amazing! AND the lemonade is beyond awesome! Go here"}
{"text":"I think pretty much everyone knows how delicious the chicken is. The hunk they put in the chicken sandwich (reg or spicy) is a whole breast fillet! The downside is they are always busy. It's worth the wait (for me anyway). I gave 5 stars for taste & value."}
{"text":"Just had a great experience so had to write about it. Stopped for drive thru lunch & it was super fast. I believe the manager was helping run the window & she was friendly, yet in full control of operations. She caught the fact that we asked for a special order that wasn't done right & had it corrected before serving the food. Even with the remake the check out speed was far faster than any other Chik Fil A location & most other fast food chains."}
{"text":"I contacted Corporate office twice. First time they didn't answer question. Now they say it's up to individual franchise to allow you to have peppers on the new breakfast platter. Sense I'm inquiry the Clerk/Cashier has taken my order, each time I asked for peppers on platter.
\"NO can't do\" but it's my Pleasure. So result, last 3 visits manager bagged food and first 2 times I didn't get salsa. Then 3rd time didn't get hashbrowns. This location will not do anything different that's on menu and if you press your wants manger will mess up your order.."}
{"text":"Usually is good,  but today it wasn't busy and my order got messed up,  they didn't give us our salad toppings, and skimped on chik fil a sauce.  The tables weren't very clean either and there were multiple employees just standing around.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Food quality is a notch above fast food, and so are prices. Very friendly staff, very clean environment. Closed on Sundays. Hope you enjoy Christian music with your food as that's all you'll hear here. Nice play area for the kids, very family friendly."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  They are probably sick of seeing me bc I am here so much. How can you go wrong?  The chicken is amazing and so flavorful. I only wish I could get hash browns all day!  

Have they made mistakes? Yes but who doesn't?  I honestly think I am their number one customer and I will keep coming back even if there is a mistake!  Got the wrong flavor soda?  I bet they fixed it!  Didn't see that in the reviews though."}
{"text":"Let me first day, we go to Chick-Fil-A's many times in a given week; it is our \"go to\".  This is NOT a standard Chick-Fil-A, the service was not that great (multiple \"in training\" employees on a Saturday at lunch.  

The food was not prepared as requested!  As stated before, we eat at Chick-Fil-A all multiple times a week.

DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is better than a normal fast food restaurant. The quality and the portions are a lot better. I love the Waffle fries they make, they are better than most french fries that fast food places provide. Since they are at the Ross Park Mall they get a lot of business, but the employees they hire at the location are very kind and outgoing. The people who make the food back in the kitchen are very efficient and always provide a good product for what you are paying. The only thing that draws back this location is that the seating areas are a little loud. Overcrowding also happens there as well. All in all, this a pleasing choice for somewhere to eat at the food court."}
{"text":"My family has gone to this Chick-fil-A location many times.  In the beginning, the food was consistently quite good.  However, lately the quality of the food has been mediocre at best.  Earlier this week, my husband and I visited this location about 2:30 in the afternoon.  The place was very busy, so it surprised us that all of our food was cold.  The staff is very friendly, but that day they seemed particularly understaffed.  
It will be a while before I spend money at this location.  Hopefully, other locations still have the same good food."}
{"text":"The classic chicken sandwich with cheese is fantastic for a quick lunch.

But I have stopped going altogether because the woman who works the dining room during lunch insists on having 3 different interactions while I am trying to chew my food.

First time she asks if everything's ok.  Next time she asks if she can refill my untouched soda.  And the third time she asks if she can take my tray. I recognize that probably follows her training guidelines. But it is not working for this guy.

All I want is 20 minutes of peace while I eat.  I am more than capable of expressing any unmet needs."}
{"text":"We love Chick fil a! We have been coming to this location for years and the staff has always been so helpful and friendly! When my kids were young, they would offer to bring my drinks to the table, bring high chairs over, anything to help! The food is great and our orders are accurate. I would recommend this location for sure!"}
{"text":"they forgot my clucking sauce!! How am I supposed to eat my chicken without my clucking sauce?! My order was chicken nugs whit some sauce. And not to mention home girl look like she hates her job, don't take that out on me Chick fil A!"}
{"text":"Clean, great food, and a great family restaurant. I like to go as an adult, but I can take my niece and nephew for a day as well."}
{"text":"Mobile app ordering is limited to $25 dollars.  Order two large fries and they were nearly half full.  If this company is so oriented about family, you can't order carry for a large family because you can't spend more than $25.  When I got the food, the food was cold, not even luke warm from the travel home.  I only live like 5 minutes or less away from this place.  For a place that's so busy and packed how can the food be cold?"}
{"text":"When I went home to Cleveland and saw they built this Chick-fil-A I was so excited.  The food is great, staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean- what more can you ask for from a fast food place?  

Lines are a bit long, but since the place is still pretty new, I guess that can be expected.  The only downside is Chick-fil-A is closed on Sundays! I guess everyone deserves a day off though!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil A, but this location needs to get it together. They've been open a couple weeks now and the service is still sooooooo slow! One person working the window taking orders, payment, food, etc.  The were completely out of honey. The breakfast biscuit just isn't complete without honey:-/ Today, I'm going with 3 stars- ridiculously slow service and ran out of an essential condiment."}
{"text":"Wow! The people here are so nice. Walking into the door me and my family were welcomed by everyone. Ordered our food, and it took less than 5 minutes to get our food. Food was great and I think it was a manger that was walking around asking if everything was okay. Definitely would recommend this place. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is awesome. There food is always fresh & taste great. The employees are friendly and always make you feel welcome. No matter how busy the drive through or in the dining room the service is always top notch. You can get in & out very quickly. All the times that I have dined in the dining area is very clean & well stocked with condiments. I have never received bad service. I believe that is why people continue to go to Chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"The service is great and you can customize your sandwich any way you want, but one thing they never remove is the homophobia. Sell chicken sandwiches and don't go around imposing your bigoted evangelical ways about who gets to marry and who doesn't. 

PS- hot sauce and pickles is a good combo."}
{"text":"We just had Breakfast!!! It was pretty good!!!This is a new location and it seems where ever they open a new location they do well! I would recommend breakfast over Mcdonalds any day! I believe this is long enough to be posted!"}
{"text":"I agree with previous posts. This Chick-fil-A is not like the others... just stopped there for ice cream 30 min before close and they had shut down their machine and just stopped serving. 
Customer service is not like the others locations."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  A woman in front of me orders a ton of food on the drive thru. Can't believe they allowed it. They had the speakers shut down and two girls taking orders which was stupid because we all had to wait for this lazy woman to order all her food. The drive thru is for speed. Where are your brains chic fil a??!!"}
{"text":"Came to this Chick Fil A for the first time with my daughter and grandkids. As soon as we walked in I could smell something that smelled like strong air freshener. Apparently they have some sort of fragrance delivery system. The smell is nauseating and giving me a migraine. Not appetizing at all. I would leave but the kids want to play. And I'm not the driver. Why have this thing? It's bad enough when they are in bathrooms but why in the eating area? It adds nothing good to the eating experience. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great location - always love their willingness to make sure you have what you want and are taken care of. :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst ever place. You should always check your bag before you drive away I got all the way home and they forgot my chicken sandwich which was highly overpriced by the way for what we received. I got three bowls of chicken noodle soup horrible tasted like rotten chicken will never be back again."}
{"text":"Perfect food & service! 

Dined in, welcomed by Geena behind an extra cashier stand so that I wasn't kept waiting. I tried the chicken breakfast burrito combo, which was delivered to my table within five minutes by another friendly employee. The establishment was mostly quiet, and several attentive employees glanced my way as they did other tasks, with Kimberly unexpectedly asking me if she could take my tray and refill my drink right when I finished my meal, to which I delightedly confirmed. 

This place hits it outta the ballpark!!"}
{"text":"Employees and management is very nice and great at what they do but the owner, With a bald shaved head, was very rude to the employees and customers. I recommend supporting better businessmen. Will not return because of the owner only."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chik-fil-a since I was born (grew up near the original one outside Atlanta)  and am glad it finally came or Nevada!   Used the app to pre-order and it was great.  Since it was their 2nd day open I knew it would be crazy so I got dropped off next door, walked across the parking lot and into the takeout door!  Within 30 seconds of getting there I got my food and was out the door to the amazement of the 200 people waiting in line! 

For others that have put a bad review, yeah it's just a chicken sandwich but it's a great quality, yummy chicken sandwich that has the best fries and lemonade ever!  Being an east coaster I guess I understand though because I feel the same way about your highly overrated In n Out Burger.

Chik-fil-a ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. I eat here frequently as I work within walking distance, and have never had it any different. Great place for a quick lunch or a family outing. My son loves the playground here too!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is the best fast food place there is. They always have exceptional service. Will be eating here often."}
{"text":"I placed an order online, and when I arrived and hit the arrival button on the app, a pop up informed that there was an error and to speak to a manager. I spoke to a manager right when I walked in and they apologized and had my order in less than a minute. The app was slightly annoying, but the service was amazing."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is amazing and we need one in Chicago. I went to the one in the Carolina Place Food Court, delicious! I got the grilled chicken & fruit salad and it was ready before I had even finished paying the lady at the cashier! Came with everything in your usual salad, plus some amazing freshly grilled chicken fruit and granola, sunflower seeds and croutons :) was delicious and next time im in the area im definitely going back. oh and they even approached us while we were eating-in the middle of a busy mall food court-and asked how us our meal was! if that isnt southern hospitality i dont know what is"}
{"text":"Worst food court restaurant ever! Bad food, extremely slow service, not open for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This Chick fil A offers decent food at this location but the owner/operator of this establishment as well as ALL Chick fil A restaurant locations could offer at least a reasonable discount to active duty military, veterans and retirees.  Arizona policemen in uniform are offered food here at no cost!  Arizona firemen are offered discounts also, etc...  The owner here Mr. Phil Thomas stated to me that, \"they reserve the right to choose whomever they want to offer discounts to....\"  He went on further to state that Arizona police in uniform with their guns offer his restaurant a sense of \"PROTECTION\" against possible altercations from the outside.  This type of discrimination against certain government officials must stop if Chick fil A wants my respect going forward.  As of now, I would not return to any of their organizations until they can respect ALL government institutions on an equal basis. Thank you!"}
{"text":"What sort of fried chicken fast food joint doesn't have a spicy chicken option?  It's absolute insanity."}
{"text":"My favorite place. The chickfilea sauce is just amazing. Staff is very friendly. I like the chips as well."}
{"text":"First time I have ever been to this chick fil a, I usually go to the ones on the south side of town. The drive thru line was insane. Took at least 20 min to make it to the window. Love the food but the wait is ridiculous. It's supposed to be \"fast food\"!"}
{"text":"Trey and Andrew helped us with our some what big order! Trey was the BEST! Great customer service. So sweet... highly recommend coming to this location:)"}
{"text":"Horrible  the chicken sandwich was so thin. Their chicken sandwich are usually thick and juicy. No this was flat and look like it had been pounded to death!  Is this the new way. Not happy!"}
{"text":"Love this place....The employees are ALWAYS so nice and friendly.  Can't beat their chicken sandwich.  Best in the fast-food world!  Their lemon aid rocks too!"}
{"text":"I wish the could give all the restaurant advice on customer service and fresh food. Starting with Boston Market."}
{"text":"Typically on every visit to this fine establishment the service and food and has been spectacular. However this time I suffered from a subpar experience. The meal was less than adequate and was quite underwhelming."}
{"text":"Been coming here 7 years and recently it appears everything is headed downhill at this location. Started when new franchise opened only a couple miles away. 
Apparently the owner isn't checking procedures. Opening includes setting up ice cream machine. Half time it isn't done. Why is it a problem for me? My son is special needs child and he loves chick fil a 
I am loyal customer but I will leave soon if things don't change.
In last week alone it's taken 20 mins to get my order, one day they actually had ice cream they didn't put the top on and by time I got home it had melted and ruined everything.  Last chance franchise owner. Nest event l am leaving and my next report will be to corporate"}
{"text":"Excellent service and outstanding food here at the mall the staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Excellent job!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. This is probably the worst location in the area.  We typically frequent the Huntersville location which is great. 

Was stuck in the drive thru line for over 30 minutes. The line wasn't even that long, just really slow."}
{"text":"I think chick-fil-a has great food.  Right when you step in they greet you in a happy way.  They were so helpful they took are tray and dumped it in the garbage.  It took 3 minutes to get our food and it was amazing.

                                                                                    -Ryan a boy who likes Chick-fil-a"}
{"text":"Just had my first Chick-fil-A. And while the chicken was a real breast and tender the bread was a pasty. The only vegetable on the sandwich was two pickles. Yuck! The service was excellent and they moved a lot of people through very fast. Don't think I'll return. McDonald's spicy chicken for a buck is just as good."}
{"text":"The quality control at this Monroeville chick-fil-a is amazing, given the daily lunch volume. This should be the gold standard for all fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Cleanliness seems to be an issue at this location.  The windows have been greasy and with finger prints the last two visits.  The inside entrance glass doors is all smeared up with greasy smudges.  The windows by the booths looking into the play area are all greased up with hand prints.  The dividing wall between the counter and front three booths has greasy finger smudges all along it facing booths.  A soapy rag and some glass cleaner would take care of this.  These windows can be a reflection on the entire store."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Great service! My son works there (15) and I love the way they hire kids 14 and above!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Chick-fil-a. We live around the corner from the Arcadia location and we go there often for a quick bite to eat. It's always clean and they have fresh flowers on tables. Unfortunately the past few times the food has been stale. Tonight the nuggets came back cold and chewy, like they have been sitting in the bin for a few hours. I politely asked for some new nuggets, they apologized and brought me fresh ones. Fries were also cold and stale. I just dealt with the fries. Service is okay. Lots of young kids working there so just wonder if they keep a close enough eye on the food. Never seen the manager there. At other locations we've always seen the manager very involved and helping the staff. Hope they make some changes so it becomes the chick-fil-a we know and love."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. Had a pleasant experience. For was alright, but the portions were a bit misleading. The staff was super friendly and very helpful. The place is new and updated, seems clean. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Go to this particular location weekly and all the staff knows me by name and are very friendly. Obviously the food is awesome. Owner is a tad too serious and is never personable, I'm in there once a week, he knows who I am but always speaks to me like I'm a first time customer. Relax and smile! Always hum and sing to the Christian music that plays and always enjoy talking to David! They always have fun activities for kids."}
{"text":"Love this place, so glad it's here finally!! But not sure I like my taxes paying for the multiple policemen working the drivethru. Chicken, egg, and cheese!!!"}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air. We walked in this evening and they found out that it was my daughters birthday. The girl at the register was going to give her a free cookie when the owner walked over and comped our entire meal. Honestly I was shocked. Later he came over and checked on us and then brought us cookies and milk for dessert. I'm blown away. What a class act. I highly recommend this location. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The one named will do slow things. They should fire him. There accounter are lazy and always long line. Their food are quick and quick made."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's chick fil a. Best fast food place ever in my opinion. This location (and really all of their locations) is always very clean, service is top notch."}
{"text":"This has become our go to place for fast food. Beats the heck out of any burger place and the employees are great."}
{"text":"Great addition to Madison!  Huge crowd but minimal waiting times. Staff was very friendly and professional. Food was awesome. The person in the cow costume was hilarious. I cannot believe this is opening week things were going so smoothly. Great job and welcome to Madtown!"}
{"text":"Super speedy and friendly service from everyone despite there being a crazy line! I particularly want to mention how sweet Brianna was.  She's so awesome! :)"}
{"text":"If I could give it a 1/2 a star I would bc I don't know what the big deal is!! I spend $40 dollars that day and I have never had such bad chicken and soggy bread in my life. We waited for months to go there after it opened!! And it was a just big disappointment!! Never going there again!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but the service was great. Not as good as CA locations but still decent. Would go if it was closer to me."}
{"text":"Management here sucks what happen to there chicken nuggets they used to be good and crispy the fries used to be great now you get them two ways cold or not cooked so what ever just wish you didn't have to give a star,we will be going to a different location"}
{"text":"Nice play area. Annoying older lady that works here is constantly going in to fuss at all the kids though. Super rude.  Typical food, polite cadhiers."}
{"text":"The staff are usually good here, although here are a few bad eggs that like to make out with their boyfriends in the parking lot.  The food is always hot, and always tasty, and the order is never wrong, but not the cheapest because the place has a lot of overhead and stupid billboards to pay for. 

All in all,  I eat here a lot, and keep going back because it's f'ing Chik-fil-a, and there is crack in the food, but the wait in the drive-thru is just ridiculous... 2.5 mins per car, and there are usually about ten in front of me no matter when I go through.  

That's a long time to wait after a fifteen hour day. With a staff of like fifteen at any given time, I don't understand the wait.  It's an excellent location if you go inside, know what you want, and don't mind ten bucks per person for fast food, but the drive-thru trap has to be dealt with before they find an aging corpse in the line."}
{"text":"Definitely never coming back they messed up my order and forgot the other half then going back to get it they downgraded it and for how much I paid for my order this was horrible not to mention my boyfriend got really sick after. Nope"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this chick fil a I have the best service. They are very polite, kinda and fast. I never have to wait even though it is always filled with customers. I've notice they do family activities almost every week and I don't even have kids! Wonderful place to grab fast yummy food."}
{"text":"the location is perfect and it's clean and nice but customer service is probably the worst i've seen. i went inside because the drive through is always a long wait. i was the only in who ordered and waited 10 minutes for my meal while my friend waited 15 minutes for one sandwich and others who got there after us were getting there food before us. when we went up to the counter to ask about our food we were ignored and the workers don't give off a good vibe either."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, always done right.  The food is second place only to the service.  I just can't get over how well the employees take care of everything.  The owner sure is lucky to have such an outstanding bunch!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Chick-fil-A and have to commend them for their excellent staff! The lines can be super long, but they take orders at your car, have the option to prepay by swiping on an iPad, and usually have someone standing outside of the window to hand you your food. The employees at this location are super friendly and polite, especially the young man who usually stands at the window. The only con about this location, which sometimes keeps me from eating there for lunch, is the traffic. The location itself is not a safe place for a busy restaurant like this. Sometimes I go around the block rather than deal with the stress of trying to cross lanes of traffic to turn left here. The line is often backed down the street, which is problematic. As for the restaurant itself, the hot food and smiling staff make it one of the best Chick-fil-A locations in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE CHIK-FIL-A. Unfortunately, this location always has been a little hit or miss. Today, I picked up my 12 count nuggets and took them back to work (5 minutes away) only to find that I only had 9 of my 12 nuggets, they were cold and half of them were burnt. Please tell me why I paid $7 for this. If you're wondering, yes I ate them but only because I was starving and couldn't leave work again.

One more thing, if I could add a picture of my food to this review, I would."}
{"text":"When me and my family stopped here after shopping at the mall, we were really pleased! The staff was SUPER nice, and the guy who helped us took a lot of pride in his work, which I really like. I ordered the chicken nuggets but got the strips instead, but it was a busy Friday night, so I know people will make mistakes, it tasted just as good as the nuggets. The establishment is very neat, clean and organized and from what it looks like on their walls, they are really involved with the community. Overall experience was really good (4.7 out of 5) I would recommend this place to others and return in the future."}
{"text":"Good chicken didn't take too long. Not much more you can say. I'd go back. Soda was also good."}
{"text":"Great place!  Super clean and nice new design and building.  The staff here are so nice!  I couldn't believe how professional they were and how quickly the food came out even though the place was packed.  Awesome job!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this chikfila! They are speedy and great kind customer service. Always clean and organized. I recommend the spicy chicken sandwich. Chikfila sauce is my fav of theirs although if you're a fry sauce fan- try mixing up a few of there mayo & ketchup packets for a special sauce. I've also added their BBQ to it and it's delicious. Another hack- if your kids get a kids meal you can trade in the toy that comes in the bag (who uses those anyways) for a FREE ICE-CREAM cone! A fabulous deal I love it! Looking for a healthy choice get the Cobb salad with garlic herb ranch- simply delicious. This location is the best I've been to. My kids love there play area too which is typically fairly clean (bonus!). Chikfila is a great Christian run - family business!"}
{"text":"Yes I like this location there very friendly and love thi waffle fries and burgers every once in a awhile Yummm"}
{"text":"Ok we all know this is about as good as it gets when it come to a piece of chicken between two piece of bread. Tasty!.  This location is brand new and for some reason doesn't seems as busy as most, at least not yet.  Only complaint is there's only one entrance to the parking lot which is on 44th street heading north."}
{"text":"Great service, great and friendly staff. Keep it up guys! Thanks for making the environment enjoyable."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and tasteful. Customer service is better than ANY fast food joint that i have ever been into. The ice cream is amazing."}
{"text":"Num, num, num.   For fast food one of the better choices you can make"}
{"text":"Always good for fast food...drive thur was very quick..  love the ketchup packets, I don't understand why every place dosent use these amazing packets"}
{"text":"Best chicken around!  So fresh and flavorful!  and the customer service is OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Excellent service & good food.  I like the chicken sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, side salads, sweet tea, & milkshakes.  Sandwiches come plain, you must ask for the toppings/condiments that you want.  Watch for the freebies & giveaways including free breakfast, & entrees for wearing cow attire.  Drive thru for quick in and out."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick stop for some waffle fries and the girl that helped me out was really nice. I think her name was Nia but she's the one that looks like Skai Jackson. I would eat there again for sure"}
{"text":"I'm assuming the food is the same at the locations, and the food we had was the same quality as all the other Chick-Fil-A's we've been to.

You get a number, and they bring your food to you.

The first thing I noticed was the play area. It was really nice, but then we noticed a sign that only 3 and under could be in there, and we didn't get that. My kid is 5, and is still in that age to play, but whatever...

I like this Chick-Fil-A because it wasn't crowded. And this is the main reason for my review. It wasn't like the other Chick-Fil-A's that are the mecca for stay at home moms which they turn into stay at home mom HELL.

If you want to avoid that crowd (like the Mooresville location), and if it's possible, come to this one."}
{"text":"Very Yummy Spicy Cgicken Sandwich cole slaw was very tasty good service a little pricey but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and excellent service in a fun family oriented environment.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a employees are always so friendly. Love eating their original chicken sandwich. Sometimes I get the nuggets with the buffalo sauce. The waffle style fries were great and the catsup packets are so convenient to use."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Long awaited visit to this restaurant not what I hoped for. Chichen has no taste. Waffle fries. Did not enjoy@all."}
{"text":"Great customer service! It was raining , and a 
nice young man ( employee) actually 
walked me to my car with an umbrella! 
I've always loved Chick- Fil-a , and certainly 
will come back to this location! Food/ service
was excellent too!!"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the cleanest Chick Fil A's I've ate at, and that's saying something for it to look that good during thier lunch rush at 12:30.

Another good thing is they had three people taking orders, so you werent waiting all day just to palce your order.

I think other place should take note during the lunch hour!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best chick-fil-A I've ever been to. They truly represent customer service. Those who work in customer service know how difficult people can be and how annoying customers can get at times.

These people do everything with such grace and elegance. To the person who walks around handing mints out, to the manager who also helps people out in the dinning area. I'm coming here everyday"}
{"text":"I have been to this and several other Chick-Fil-A restaurants and have always found the food fresh and tasty.  The restaurants are clean, including the bathrooms, and the service is outstanding.  If you are trying to eat healthy, this is probably the best choice out of the fast food restaurants.  As for me...I'm sticking with the chicken nuggets and waffle fries.  I love them."}
{"text":"Very clean!  Their sanitation rating was like 98.5, or 99.5!  Very impressive for a small food-court location.  Our visit was Tuesday evening abt 5:30pm.

My daughter had a grilled chicken sandwich, and side of fruit.  My daughter said it was hot, delicious, & the best chicken sandwich she's ever had!  It also was a very big piece of chicken on the sandwich!  The fruit was very very fresh & crispy - flavor was great!

The guy at the counter that helped us was \"Derrick\" & her was extremely polite and even did a dance thru the door to the kitchen area.  My daughter thought that was cool!   Derrick even called us \"young ladies\".  Very nice!!  Give that man a paid day off Manager!!

Will be eating here when we visit the Carolina Place Mall!"}
{"text":"Had the cool wrap.  Tasted good for fast food.  While I was eating, I looked up the ingredients and nutrition.  Whatever happened to just plain food?  There are so many additives in the wrap.  Because of this, I would come back very seldom. Unfortunately, this chain purports to be healthy food.  I encourage anyone who eats here to check the ingredients in their choices before ordering."}
{"text":"There food and service is amazing but I clearly stated no chicken no cheese on my salad And when I saw chicken it was really hard to remove it because I don't eat that"}
{"text":"My least favorite Chick Fil A location. A lot of blue shirts stand around often, my online order has been  incorrect on the last  8/10 orders., and they like to use excuses for mistakes. Do better."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of chick fil a but this location doesn't seem to be that good. I've been here around five times so far and have already got wrong items twice.  They either forget to put the fries in your order or upgrade them to something you never ordered..and charge you for that. Glad they will refund you but it's a hassle to drive back. Have to be very careful and check the food before leaving at this location."}
{"text":"Just tried the newly renovated Chick-fil-A in Belmont today.  Had plenty of time to check the dining area, seeing as how they forgot my order.  Had to go back to the counter and ask about my order in which they took my receipt and then gave me my food.  The three tenders I had were barely above room temperature and the awful fries, excuse me waffle fries, were under done.  Definitely was not \"MY PLEASURE\" dining there today.  Doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The food is great, but DON'T rush from the drive through without checking your bag for all of your ordered items.  And also check your receipt for that matter.  I ordered one meal, one sandwich, and one small fries.  Did not get our fries and the receipt says we were charged extra for the drink that came with the meal (that was given to us WITHOUT a straw).  So frustrating!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if this location is up to Chic-fil-a standards,  might need some corporate attention.  Bench I'm sitting on has duct tape covering a hole and not one person serving me or bringing the food said thank you or even the traditional my pleasure.  Overall the place is filthy."}
{"text":"Came in again on a beautiful Friday afternoon to be given excellent service once again, this time by Jazmine and Sydney, they were both so sweet and had my order executed flawlessly!!!! Love this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. The chicken is always moist and tender. The fries are good. The milkshakes are great, if you don't mind paying a little more. Of all the fast food restaurants, Chick Fil a easily has the best customer service, maintaining consistently great customer service across almost ALL restaurants. They hire a lot of kids in high school with a lot of potential and develop great customer service skills in all employees."}
{"text":"Two strikes in three days.  I met a friend here for lunch two days ago.  There was one person ahead of us in line but it still seemed to take a while just to order.  As we caught up and visited I didn't mind the wait but on another day it might have been a problem.  Eventually we ordered our food and were given a plastic tower and told to have a seat and to place the tower on our table.  So we sat down and continued our visit and in several minutes someone brought a tray of food with our sandwiches and fries on it.  No drinks.  So my friend hopped up and volunteered to go and get them.  Well, there must have been something going on because it took about 10 minutes to get the drinks.  They did apologize for not giving us the drinks earlier.  Unfortunately, by this time, our food was lukewarm.  Nothing like lukewarm french fries.  I ate about 1/3 of mine and that was all I could do.  We ate and continued our discussion.  No follow up by any employees like i am used to at other Chick-Fil-As.  Usually someone comes around cleaning up, offering drink refills or just checking on things.  Nothing.  I also kind of expected a manager to stop over and apologize for our delays and the failure to provide our drinks.  But things were about to turn bad.  Shortly after returning home my stomach began to rumble and within a couple of hours I was sick with what appeared to be food poisoning.  My friend had a couple of hour drive and just made it home before getting sick as well. Given that we had not anything else together that day, it made me suspicious but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Fast forward two days and I had an early morning and needed a quick breakfast out.  I'm not that picky about breakfast food and decided to swing back by Chick-Fil-A.  As I pulled into the drive-thru I was reminded of previous visits where choosing the wrong queue (they have 2 queues that merge into one) meant extra waits as they seem to often service one line more quickly and frequently than the other.  Today I chose my line and waited.  And waited.  And.....5 cars went through the other queue and in the same period of time 1 car went through my queue.  I calculated that if the pace continued I might be there for 20 more minutes or longer.  As I was running out of time and my line was showing no signs of improvement, I left.  I had a meeting a couple of miles away and all of my cushion (and then some) was gone.  I'd been in line 12 minutes.  Since this wasn't the first time I'd been burned by their double queue I thought I might call and explain what I had been seeing to a manager.  

So I called and spoke with a bubbly young (sounding) woman who claimed to be a manager.  She listened to my feedback (most of it) and apologized for the problem and then said they'd had a rush.  As I tired to clarify my issue she cut in again with more apologies and an explanation that it was busy because kids were back in school.  (It wasn't that busy, it was just slow).  I finally got her to understand the issue and she assured me that she would speak to the person who was currently staffing the headset.  She aid that \"sometimes they for get to alternate between the queues\".  I tried to point out that just talking with that one person would not solve the issue.  There's a fundamental weakness in their system if they rely on a single person to remember to alternate lanes on the drive through.  She didn't get it.  But she assured me she would speak to everyone on the opening staff so that they were all aware.  I gave up at that point.  The breakfast may have been good but I didn't even get any today.

Chick-Fil-A, if you are listening.....
1)  Something about your new dine-in system isn't working.  If you're going to bring people their food then bring all of it.  Drinks are pretty core to the meal.  I'm sure you agree since you feature them as part of combination meal.  Doing this half way makes it far more inconvenient for your diners and the meal isn't nearly as pleasant after it's cooled.

2)  You have a fundamental problem in managing your double queue drive through.  Because this is a systemic problem with a single point of failure (and in my experience it fails far too often) you need to address the flaws.  Until you can properly manage and maintain a double queue you should block off one of the entry queues and ordering stations.  Channel everyone through the same ordering station so that customers get a consistent experience in their delays.  If you can figure out how to manage the double queue, please bring it back.  Clearly, right now, this is outside of your skill set.  

If you're really that lost on how to handle business, perhaps send your managers down to the Arboretum or Stonecrest.  Both seem to be very well run.  I visit Arboretum fairly often and it's a juggernaut by comparison.  How come they can get it right?  

And, please, handle your food carefully.  I was over the possible food-poisoning by the next day but really."}
{"text":"Disappointed to have to write this but my last visit was a complete turnaround from previous experiences.  

It wasn't super busy but still took too long to place my order.  There were two people in front of me.  It was between 5 and 10 mins before I got to place my order.  Not sure what was holding them up.  

I ordered a #1 combo with a soft drink.  

The soft drink was almost all ice.  Usually this isn't an issue with dine-in because Chick Fil A employees used to walk the dining room cleaning up, offering refills, checking on orders, etc.  Not this time.  I kept waiting for someone to make the rounds (there were 8 tables occupied) but it never happened.  

My entree was OK.

My side was about 60% of what I would call a normal serving.  Not sure why they were so stingy with the potatoes but it was definitely a sub par experience. Since nobody came by to inquire about my experience I didn't provide feedback.

When I got ready to leave I was still thirsty and had been out of my beverage for a while.  I went up to the front counter and set my cup down.  I stood there for several minutes while employees walked by.  Nobody noticed me or stopped to ask if they could help.  After seeing a number of people go through the line at the register I gave up on getting a refill and simply left.  

No idea why their service has slipped so far but I might as well go just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have to first say the food was good. The issue I have is an employee of theirs had a friend come in, the started talking to each other (in Spanish) loudly. She then told her to go sit down and wait for her (right next to me). I had to get up and move, being a veteran and a citizen of this country it bothers me that these people won't learn our language, English. It's fine if you want to know other languages but this countries language is English and you should at minimum speak it. I don't support or endorse places that have employees like that. If they want to talk, then do it after work or in private. You represent that company and lost my families business and whoever else's business after I let them know of my experience. It's my loss I know, but I pick my country over a business enabling employees not to learn english."}
{"text":"The service first and foremost was outstanding , very speedy and friendly of course, the chicken was honestly to hot to eat so i had to wait to eat it but i dont mind at all cause cold food that is served is my absolute pet peeve i hate it .. But this wasnt an issue, but overall it was very clean and a pleasant visit"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a has been one of my go-to places in recent. The food here is great, the staff is great, but parking and lines are not so great.

If you really want some fast food go else where, chick-fil-a are for people who don't mind waiting. It's really a good place to eat but can get pretty hectic.

The drive-thru line is pretty bad and the parking during busy hours can be a bummer. Overall I do like this place and will come here when I have time."}
{"text":"This is by far the cleanest and friendliest branch I've gone to. And we eat here with my son who has many food allergies and they always get our order correct and his food is handled really well...that's very important to us."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chick-fil-A I've ever been too by a substantial margin.  Employees were arguing with each other and the service was painfully slow.  The cashier had to go get food for people in front of me while other employees did nothing.  I recommend CFA corporate should completely take this place over."}
{"text":"Last week we stopped on a Thursday and got free breakfast entrees. In addition, we ordered a side of fruit. I decided to save the fruit, and held onto it until Friday. I was quite surprised to see mold on the strawberries. Yuck! Fortunately for me, I held onto my receipt and politely took the bad fruit to the establishment where I'd purchased it. Please note, that this is NOT the reason for this poor review. We stopped for breakfast again and sat in the drive-thru line for every bit of 8 mins; though it seemed liked 20. 

Why hold up the line for someone's missing waffle fries/tater tots? Why can't they pull to the side and have their meals brought out when ready? Sort of like their nameless neighbor on the East side of the building (eh'em!). There no apologies, no explanation or anything. I find it completely unacceptable to have customers waiting that long; but in the early am commute? Seriously? Who does that? Then, to top it off, we get 15 miles away to find that the key piece to those biscuit chicken bites is no where to be found. No honey! Even after it was confirmed that there was some in the bag. Argh!

The ONLY thing that Chick fil a can get me right now is a strawberry milkshake."}
{"text":"Placed a mobile order rushed down there on my break to pick it up to be notified that the app wasn't working and that I would have to wait in the back of the line that was almost backed up to the door. I only have a 30min on my break and didn't have the time to wait In line and then for them to cook my food which is why I placed the mobile order in the first place. It's not there fault the system wasn't working and I understand that but when I kindly explained my situation I got \"sorry bout that\" very frustrating to work a 9 hour shift with nothing to eat. By the time I got out of there it was time to rush back to work. Very annoying."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite ones to go to. They always are very friendly and when we go inside to eat there is usualluy a kind lady who is working the floor  helping customers as myself  to get refills so I don't have to go to the counter and drag my kids. My order is always right too."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever experienced at a Chick Fil A! I'm actually shocked how rude the employees were today."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad thing to say about a Chick fil a but this place is so dirty! The play area is covered in trash, tables not cleaned. Just gross."}
{"text":"We got sandwiches from them that were still a bit raw and pink in the middle. I would give only one star but the employee who served us at the register, Jose, was very nice and polite. Otherwise, very disappointed. I always have a much better experience at the arrowhead location."}
{"text":"Worst chic fil a experience ever!  The lemonade was rancid, the waffle fries were over cooked and medium warm, and the chicken strips were rubbery and over cooked as well.  I had it to go, so it was too late to go back.  Will never go to this location ever again.  
Or is Saturday at 3:30pm the wrong time to go?  Blech. I didn't finish anything."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location since it opened. Usually is a good experience but not as of late. One of these times they'll get my order right."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A has been a great addition to the fast food market here in Fairlawn.  The lunch rush can get a little busy, but the staff does an excellent job getting all the orders out in a timely fashion.  They're usually in a very friendly mood as well.

I know some people do not agree with chicken for breakfast, but I've been a fan of their spicy chicken biscuits as an alternative to McDonald's slop."}
{"text":"Great place.  The \"politics\" is what makes the place what it is.  Friendly and polite staff.  Food was great as always.  Max was very Friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a work meeting, I told the guy that took my order that it was my first time at a Chick Fil A, I asked for a bacon chicken burger combo without tomatoes, I said it twice, the guy at the cashier confirmed my order. I had to also ask him about the sauces and what they taste like, his answer was \"you can pick any\" didn't sound like he wanted to assist much. Got my burger and guess what? Burger had tomatoes, I was gonna bring the burger back but the line was long and I was hungry, I removed the tomatoes myself but the flavor was still there, didn't really enjoyed the burger much."}
{"text":"Best kid friendly place I've been to since I become a parent 5 yrs ago!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a protein packed chicken sandwich fast. The people that work here are friendly and the drive thru moves pretty fast. I only wish they were open on Sundays for my afternoon workout post meal. Other than that I like this place and that says a lot coming from me. Only downside is that it does get pricey but you get what you pay for and it's better than McDonalds (Which I never eat)!!!"}
{"text":"It's chick-fil-a, it's awesome. This is a new location and it looks great. Service is friendly, just like you would expect from chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"Yonka je hi hoo Bob loves Mary bob loves Mary bob loves Mary bob loves Mary blob loves Mary Maryland was a great night out there was that he was just a bit and the guys that were very good at getting it and the guys who are the most awesome  I had to do the first thing they do me the most awesome  was my new shoes I was so happy they had the awesome  was the best I have ever had and I love you guys and we love it the service was so cute and I was so impressed by my car I was so excited for my new bike and we had the car wash car car wash my bike and got to get it and get my bike out and get it back on the car I would definitely go here if I had to get a bike I had a car car wash car car for a great car I had the auto repair auto and I got my bike and they did an amazing bike shop for the auto car and they did an amazing great auto sales manager I would recommend this auto shop for a car and I will be coming here for my next shop to try this place if I can I have been there to get a car for the price I can get my bike out for the next few days and we can get the guys out of the way and will definitely go here for the most awesome bike shop."}
{"text":"Always clean, always friendly, always fast, and always delicious. If your going to go fast food, this is about as healthy as it gets."}
{"text":"Usually we thoroughly enjoy our time at Chick-fil-A....but this one in Homestead, PA was another story altogether.  Actually...it was hard to believe that this was actually a Chick-fil-A.  The restaurant was extremely dirty...trash all over and under tables...open sauce packets (ketchup/mayo/nugget sauces, etc) all over serving areas.  We were so tired from a long day of travel we actually stayed and ate...but we had to clean a table before we could use it...and we will NEVER go back to this location. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Closed on Sundays in respect of the Lords Day. Praise God! Putting faith before finance....how blessed is that! People here are sweet spirited and of course the food is good. Thanking my Creator daily for moving us here."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at any chickfila, horrible customer service, thanks for not helping at all."}
{"text":"Kids Nite Tuesdays! Mascot, face painting, fun and more!  

The staff was so cool with all the kids. And CLEAN!  This location brought your order to your table, removed your tray and were just all around great! I even heard \"my pleasure\" when another customer asked for a refill. The staff member, Eric,  took the cup, refilled it and returned to the customer's table, smiling the whole time!  Both the young men working the dining area were polite and helpful.

The food was great too!  My son and I shared nuggets and waffle fries.  Okay he didn't share the waffle fries to much, I think I got one or two.

It was a great time for my son and I!"}
{"text":"Friendly people and amazing food. I love to bring my kids to this safe Christian environment."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a \"F\" they get our order wrong more often than they do right. Today wrong sandwich, last week Friday's sandwich had cheese when we asked for no cheese. Monday's bagel sandwich was an English muffin and I got 2 bagel bottoms with cream cheese. We never order biscuits on Monday because they are dried out and hard. Then there was a time the bagels were so hard you could knock on wood with them. The people seem nice - so not sure if this a training issue or lack of caring. Oh and if you order hash browns - be prepared to get anywhere from 9-15 of them.  Sigh I guess @mcdonalds is our alternative-at least the orders are right and consistent."}
{"text":"Best Chick-fil-A team I've ran across. Smart and courteous youngins keepin it real. Munchis satisfied. Westside OUTLAWZ"}
{"text":"The best chicken and pretty healthy I've ever had! Service is the bomb! I respect a Christian company that stands up for God!"}
{"text":"I almost feel bad giving chik fil a a bad review because generally I love it. However with this location I have  had many issue. Almost every time I go to this location I feel like I am getting jipped. They skimp a ton on what you pay for. I ate here a few weeks ago and we ordered large fries but when we got them they were barley half full. Finally yesterday I got a salad from this location and only got three pieces of chicken. For a freaking 8 dollar salad! 


I would totally recommend chik fil a just don't go to this one if you want your money's worth. Drive to the location on Thomas and Camelback, I have never had tons of problems there. The lines are crazier but they won't straight up screw you out of your money like the Indian School location will."}
{"text":"under cooked chicken sandwich. busy is not an excuse for under cooked food."}
{"text":"I love the Mesa Chick-fil-A on the 60 and Stapley. That being said... The San Tan location does not compare. I cannot go on a lunch break because they are so slow. The wait is unbelievable. The Stapley location can be jam packed and still keep a flow going with great food and awesome customer service. I sometimes visit San Tan in the morning. The wait is not as bad but the food is not good either. My portions are small and the food is typically cold. Being that it is the only breakfast place close to work I continue to go a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Food was good, kids like the meals they get. I like that they give kids books with the kids meal instead of a silly toy."}
{"text":"I had Chick-fil-A for the first time when this location opened up, and I have to say that I was impressed with the quality of the chicken that was in my spicy chicken sandwich. It is miles above the \"chicken\" that they serve at other fast food restaurants, and the flavors are great too."}
{"text":"Seriously:  other quick service restaurants should be taking notes.  For that matter, all restaurant-types should have their management teams taking notes.  Service is unbelieveably good - friendly, efficient, professional, genuine, etc.  Never understaffed.  Never had my order come out wrong (N= ~300 visits).

I'd also like to compliment them on their focus on community integration.  From the grounds of the building itself to the multiple school functions and daddy/daughter nights, Chick Fil A rocks.  They're not just a restaurant, but rather a part of the lives of the members of the local community.  Cheesy, I know, but I believe it.

Handwritten notes on soft drink cups, table service, passing books to kids as the enter, \"my pleasure, sir,\" fresh-cut flowers, the water feature outside, the clean play area for the kiddos with the wet naps next to the door, etc.  They handle all of the service details really really well.

3 paragraphs later I'm getting to the food......  consistently good.  Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner (or sometime in between) - doesn't really matter.  They provide great food at reasonable prices.

If I had a complaint, and I really don't, I would point out this particular location can get very crowded on \"school-partnership\" nights.  If I had a magic wand, I'd make the restaurant 50% larger.

Good work."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location fewer times than others in the area because the busy location off of 83rd Ave/Bell makes the dining process a little too hectic generally.  But the food itself is good, and the staff are generally friendly.

Familiarize yourself with Chick-Fil-A's nationwide generous coupon acceptance policies and you will save yourself a few bucks.  Unfortunately, two of the counter staff needed to be schooled in the policy during different visits to this location.  In visits to about 15 CFAs in a couple of states, that is unusual and it should probably be something that employees should be trained or re-trained in."}
{"text":"I have visited this location for many years.  It has been fairly consistent as far as friendliness and food quality go.  Perhaps it has slipped on a few visits with the clean-up on chairs and tables (crumbs of previous diners), but those were isolated incidents.  With one exception, the register employees seem to understand Chick-Fil-A's generous coupon acceptance policy, and that person might have been new."}
{"text":"Most Chick-Fil-A restaurants are run well, and this location is no exception.  I do not visit here too often because of my own sodium concerns, but the food quality, cleanliness, and service are always excellent.  

The parking lot is a bit awkwardly laid out, and you really have to watch out for vehicles at the drive-thru entrance and exit, especially at night."}
{"text":"I've come here three days in row now. The customer service is the best of the best of the best, sir. This place is no joke good. They're on a whole other level. Go get you some!"}
{"text":"It's what you expect from a chickfila but as others have noted, this one is a little slow... I think chickfila is the best fast food you can get!!! The new grilled nuggets are delicious (and try the honey roasted bbq sauce, you won't regret it) and the waffle fries are always amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the long line, this is a well oiled machine! They pump out food faster and better than I've ever seen! I've been eating here regularly at lunchtime for over 10 years - my order is always right and we all know how delicious chickfila waffle fries are - need you say more?"}
{"text":"This restaurant has yet to get my order correct and I've been there tons of times. I am always very specific but yet they can never get it right. They never give me the sauce I ask for. I just got home to find my 12 count nugget only have 4 dry and hard nuggets in It. Whoever manages this store does not know what they are doing and should be fired. I run multiple businesses and I would never allow my operation to be run like this. I can understand messing up once or maybe even twice, but literally they have yet to get an order correct they always mess it up and I just don't know how a business can operate like that. Absolutely pathetic."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying I love chick-fil-a but this location at Dunlap my wife and I went there at 930 in the evening we each place our orders I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich there was not many people in the restaurant a few employees but they were sitting down at tables over 80% of the tables were dirty... one of the employees who is sitting in the Restaurant walked behind the counter and placed her order directly at the register her name was Olivia... Holly was the cashier who took our order. My wife and I were sitting not too far away from the area that you place your orders at we noticed that Olivia walk from the booth that she was sitting in and got her food probably 2 minutes after placing her order she got her food before ours next we hear employees yelling out for Olivia they were yelling to come back after she was sitting down for a couple of minutes and for her to bring her food with her. I immediately got up and walked to the cashier area and I watched Olivia hand off her sandwich which was in a in chickfila box they told her she grabbed the wrong sandwich I watched the manager pass the sandwich back to the kitchen I asked Holly the cashier if that was my sandwich and if it was I do not want it as it went out to a table and was out there for a few minutes I would like a new sandwich I figured it was mine as there was no one else in the restaurant ordering food. She asked the manager and she said yes it was a grilled chicken sandwich the manager then told the employees in the back they're going to need to make another chicken sandwich I thought this was real tacky as they were going to serve me that sandwich I forgot to mention yes that sandwich along with my wife's sandwich and fries were already on a platter ready to be served to us. I confronted the manager about this she denied all responsibility and just said that she didn't know I told her you did see the employee bring it back to you and hand it to you and you handed it to the back all she kept saying is I'm sorry I didn't know. This chick-fil-a is obviously poorly ran which is a first that I have seen... the employees obviously do not care about customers do not care about cleaning the restaurant and have absolutely no pride"}
{"text":"10am...asked for chicken strips but they needed fifteen min to cook some if I wanted them. said no. got the free iced coffee which was too sweet to drink. asked for hot decaf but they didn't have any made and said it would also take 15 min.  didnt get. dining room smells like tinkle from the kids play area. gross. won't come here again."}
{"text":"One of the friendliest,  if not the friendliest fast food place you could ever visit and eat. Food is always top notch quality and the service is above any expectations that one could have!! The staff is always super friendly and engaging! Never have had a bad meal or experience here!!!"}
{"text":"We got in line to get Chickfila behind some people who were ordering. Both cashiers proceeded to walk away and we were left standing there not being helped. Assuming they were busy we waited. After about 6 minutes we see 3 kids who came after us behind helped. Getting kind of antsy I say so is anyone gonna help us? Nothing not even a look. While 2 of the workers were just standing there talking amongst themselves. We opted for Show Mars instead. Usually CFA has amazing service, what happened?"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever in a Chick-fil-a...
1) waiting time in line: more than 10 minutes
2) food delivery to table: 10 minutes. Despite  the color system, and being alone, the employee asked if I ordered a kid's menu.
3) the tangerine pieces in the Asian salad were unfresh, slimy, disgusting.
4) the \"chicken soup\" was a slimy substance  with pieces of noodles and no chicken.
5) while I am still writing these notes, I am already felling pain in the stomach.

Last time coming to this \"restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Messed my food order up without hesitation brought me a fresh order and a free cookie to sweeten the wound. Awesome service and always so nice."}
{"text":"Staff meets basic expectations, but the food is not very good at all. I keep forgetting how bad the food is here compared to other Chic-fil-As in the valley. Food tastes like movie theater food. Not fresh at all."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite for dinner and sat on the patio with our dog. Attendant brought our food outside and then offered to bring out water for our dog. Wonderful service! 

Food was delicious as always too!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to getting a store near us so much. The lines are big and even when you make a mobile order, you still have to wait for your order. I didn't mind it as much because we enjoyed the food. The worst thing is the service. We made a mobile order and went to pick up. You know when you have the kids and just want to get your food and leave. I get home and it is missing items, so I called and talked to an Anthony, who was so rude and said: we can't give you your money back and if you want your food, you need to drive back over here. It is a 30 minute drive and he basically raised his voice to me and spoke like: it is just the way it is! No apology, nothing! So disappointing. Not sure I can take that attitude anymore by going back there!"}
{"text":"God bless chic fi la! They can even make a salad delicious and filling. The market salad with Polynesian dressing is my go to diet dinner. Y'all know the chicken sandwich with waffles fries is a crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Managers and staff were friendly throughout the drive thru. Would recommend trying it out to newcomers."}
{"text":"Food came out and the cheese was cold on my Spciy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich. Asked for it to be reheated and waited for about 10 minutes for it to come back out. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Maybe we came in on a bad day or something, but I will let my picture speak for itself. First off, the young woman taking our order was completely dead inside she had no personality and looked like she hated her life. I felt like I was inconveniencing her because I didn't want the entire meal but just the entrée and when our food came out it was basically pieces of fried breading. Maybe if this location wasn't so preoccupied about providing diapers and warming bottles for all the East Valley religious nut jobs they might learn how to cook chicken better."}
{"text":"Great as always. I've been three times already. 

I went today, YES AGAIN, and my only criticism is that the girl taking my order was wiping her nose with her fingers. Then she offered to scan my card. That was kind of gross. I know it was windy and cold but that should be addressed. Luckily I had cash, which I never do. 

They should have tissue or take breaks or heaters to avoid this. 

Otherwise, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is the by far the best and the nicest chickfila I have ever been to. Its chickfila so you know the service is great and it's located in a very nice and new area. This chickfila may be spoiling me."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing and very consistent. The service is super fast. Everyone is always so friendly. Definitely would recommend it! Get the cool chicken wrap with avocado ranch with their waffle fries, and a shake! You're welcome"}
{"text":"Always quick, friendly, and satisfying! Everything I expect from a chic fil a and its the same experience every time! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Love the chick-fil-A chicken sandwich with some honey roasted BBQ sauce. The staff is always friendly at this location and never once had a bad experience"}
{"text":"I've had nothing but kind things to say about Chic fil A but Friday night was a poor impression....
I asked for 10 packets of sauce. I was willing to pay, I understand food cost. That's what I needed to enjoy my food and I was also grabbing some for my son who hadn't enough with his take out order. Didn't feel like I had to explain myself to the rude cashier Hailey who felt it necessary to mock me by laughing at my 10 packet request and announcing it rather loudly to her manager on duty.
I would've been OK with a \"no\"....Just not OK with the juvenile laughing. Please coach this young lady about customer service."}
{"text":"Menu prices appear to be set in real time based upon what the student cashiers think they can pocket in overcharges; recommend paying with c-card to provide recourse for overbilling."}
{"text":"Great customer service food is good staff is well mannered and polite. They have been trained well. They will make an effort to not leave you waiting in line. So that impressed me a great deal. It is obvious that the customer experience is a top priority. Need something quick to eat?  Go for it."}
{"text":"Closes at 6:30pm on a Saturday night. Ridiculous. The whole airport appears to shut down for that matter. For a city that's up and coming, really disappointing. Traveling with a family through Cleveland in the evening? Beware."}
{"text":"Always down for some Chick-fil-a!  Love the spicy chicken sandwich & waffle fries."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I tried Chick-fil-a   I can't believe what I've been missing out on!  Drive thru service was polite, super fast and friendly.  Food is excellent!  Grilled chicken is so tasty!  Chicken salad sandwich is good too.  Hot food separate from the cold is appreciated and thoughtful!  Decent price for the tastiness! I will be visiting this location more often after jumping on the band wagon!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and still a lot of kinks. They  often mess up my order and their cookies are hard as rocks every single time. Also their customer service isn't as friendly as other chick fil a restaurants I've been to. It's close to me but I would rather drive to the one in Gilbert to ensure good service"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The grilled nuggets are juicy, the superfoods salad is so tasty and what can you say about the waffle fries except I want more!!! People are friendly and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent! Far more friendly and attentive than your average fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I eat at this place at least once or twice a week. My favorite is the breakfast menu, but the original sandwich and waffle fries are also addictively delicious! The chick-fil-a sauce is good on everything, especially strips and fries, and I love the new frosted lemonade! The service is prompt and friendly, the place is always clean, and I love the family friendly, cafe-like atmosphere. They have several places to plug in a laptop and free wifi, which makes it a great place to grab hot, yummy food AND get some work done!"}
{"text":"Last night was my 1st time coming to this location. I have been to the PV mall & Scottsdale & Mayo locations a few times in the past. Oh & does anyone remember the OLD location INSIDE of PV mall, where it had 2 stories?! That location was the shit. Any way I love Chick-fil-a! Their nuggets beat any fast food joints out there-McDonalds, Wendys, all of em. I also love their waffle fries, so addicting! I haven't had one in a while, but their milkshakes are bomb too! The employees are also very friendly which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"I love everything about this Chick-Fil-A! The food is good, staff is friendly and fast, restaurant is clean, and just a great overall dining experience! Not all fast food restaurants are equal and this Chick-Fil-A is clearly going the extra mile to serve great food and give an all around enjoyable experience. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at a Chick Fil A but these employees at this location are so friendly. Always smiling and in a good mood. Makes the whole experience pleasant!"}
{"text":"Dooooooooode,
I'm in love with this place,
Absolutely the best customer service you could ever ask for.
The food is delicious, fresh and just yummy in general.
I go here as often as possible.
They have the best fries! The best grilled chicken sandwiches! And I love their honey mustard barbecue sauce, I find myself eating like 7 or 8 packets of that stuff.

Anyhoo, the only bad thing is the parking, it's always takes like 5 minutes to park and sometimes it's really packed when you go inside, it's really crowded.
But that's what you get with good food:)"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. After dealing with the rude cashier I cancelled my order and left out of principal. 
Furthermore, this company is racist and It's probably better not to support them."}
{"text":"What a great business ! The staff is amazing ! They treat you like you are at a 5 star restaurant the manager that works their is amazing ! I love how they say my pleasure lol honestly it's the little things ! I'm not surprised at all how busy they are they run a great business with great food and staff and location = great business ! This is the only fast food place I ever go to !"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a food with poor service and poor quality. Pulled up this morning and waited for 8 minutes after paying cause I wanted a spicy chicken, which for some reason they are not making for breakfast anymore.  Expecting the same quality as my local store, I got a blackend bagael, and cold hash browns. No sauce and no honey.  Paying over 9 dollars for breakfast and waiting for 8 minutes after sitting in the parking lot this was unacceptable. I called and they said I could bring it back and they would make me a new one? That's crap, some of us have big boy jobs that are not frying up frozen chicken.  I love chick Fil a, but I will never return to this location.  With as many spots for breakfast in the area, you can do allot better. Don't be fooled by the sign that says Chick Fil A, this place is not up to par by any means."}
{"text":"Eh. Food is really good for fast food but they leave out items many times. Always check your bag before leaving this place to insure you got everything you ordered."}
{"text":"This has got to be the absolute worst location. The parking lot setup, the entrance, the drive-through! Whoever decided this location is a complete moron."}
{"text":"Great service all the time from management to servers. They have a great ordering system that just makes the whole process so efficient. Even when there is a line, it goes by fast, but they don't make you feel rushed. I order the chicken sandwich all the time and the Polynesian sauce goes great with it. They have a lot of employees working there too so I think that's why the whole system works so well. Kudos to the food and great service!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service! The drive-thru was a block-and-a-half long but and move by pretty fast there's even people with light things like in the airport, to help you move along. The food is pretty cheap and good. It's nice to have an establishment like this in Vegas. Would recommend and will come back!"}
{"text":"Nice people but they often mix up the grilled vs. fried chicken nuggets. 
Just ordered the 8 piece grilled nuggets at the drive through but they gave us the fried ones our child will not eat (again).
No sweetener in the iced coffee as well.
Too far way to go back sadly.  
Check your order before you leave the window."}
{"text":"Everyone is so incredibly nice there!  This is way better than any other fast food place. The food is delicious too!  I wish there was a little more room for parents to sit in the kids' play area.  But I really appreciate the wipes they keep handy to clean little hands on their way out."}
{"text":"The customer service was Excellent. We are from Chicago and the service was the Best. 
The Food was very good also."}
{"text":"Was at the Ribbon cutting a couple weeks ago and loved the samples, but today I ran in to Cobb Salad heaven.  Had it with the Peppers and the Avocado Ranch Dressing it was awesome, large portion which I licked the plate when done.  If your looking for a better choice than other Fast Food so called Salads, you gotta try this one, it's the bomb...
Oh and the New lemonade Smoothie was also great..."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Didn't like my biscuit crumbling as I bit into my sandwich. I got a sausage, egg, and cheese. My sister got chicken, egg, and cheese. I like the chicken better than the sausage (not surprised since it's famous for chicken). Will be coming again for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best chick fil a I've ever been to. Always super fast and my order is always right. Staff is very nice and willing to help however they can. This is also probably the busiest chick fil a in my area and they manage to keep wait time lower than most."}
{"text":"Clean.  Great customer service. Family oriented.  Excellent tasting, high quality food.  They have a program to promote family togetherness by challenging the family to put our cell phones in the box for the whole meal to earn a free ice cream....the kids were all over this!  Brilliant!  The marketing director greeted us and took care of us the whole meal...refilled our drinks, asked about us as people, and spread positivity to our experience.  I believe her name was Sylvia...what a great person.   We do not have this restaurant where we ar from.....we are very impressed."}
{"text":"I've never had anything but good customer service at a Chick Fil A, but I guess there's a first time for everything. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich meal. The food was, as always, great but the person working the drive through certainly didn't live up to the Chick Fil A ethic. First, my drink cup had soda all over it so I asked that she wipe it off. She got an attitude and sort of huffed under her breath. Then, I asked if there was any sauce in the bag and asked for Polynesian. She acted like I asked for a miracle. To top off my less than stellar experience at this establishment, when I told her \"thank you\" she didn't say \"my pleasure\" she said \"welcome.\" This worker definitely did not embody Chick Fil A principles. Get over yourself and quit being rude."}
{"text":"I went the first day they opened because I had never been to a chick fil a and had heard great things.  They handled the crazy opening with surprising ease.  I am happy to saw that the friendly, courteous service hasn't changed.  Lemonade is great and I really liked their spicy chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"There has to be a camp somewhere they brainwash their employees to be so damn nice that it can border on creepy.  The place is also clean, orders are out quickly no matter how many people are there and food quality is better than average for fast food.

If you go during the morning try the chikin minis, they're addictive and calorie / sodium count isn't horrible."}
{"text":"Since there's few affordable places for breakfast in the area I hit this location more often then I should.  As other reviews have said this place is usually busy in the mornings but wait times are never very long, the staff are friendly and prices aren't much higher than what I think the food is worth.

I almost always get the three count chicken minis, these things are some of the best breakfast food items I've ever had anywhere.  The oatmeal is also pretty good with all the extras dumped in, not a big fan of egg & cheese on a biscuit so I can't say anything about those.

This place is pretty good for a quick breakfast that you won't hate yourself for eating."}
{"text":"The manager was pretty cheerful and great customer service. However our first visit got ruined because of poor customer service and unwelcoming gestures of an associate named Bella. Hope next time she can at least put a smile and greet people with enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give 0 stars? 

Make the drive to Belmont; this Chick-fil-A is a joke. Their service is awful and the orders are almost always wrong. It is incredibly slow, whether you do the drive through or walk in. The staff is rude and I often see them just standing around talking. 

I could write of several bad encounters here but I'm sure I would run out of room. So I pick this: I was in line for their breakfast, which ends at 10:30am. I was in their drive through line before this time. As I mentioned before, they are very slow so by the time I was ready to order, it was 10:31 and they refused to serve me breakfast. Seriously?! Don't cross homegirl on the breakfast! 

It was \"my pleasure\" to write this."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is known for NEVER messing up an order. This location always messes up my order or forgets an item. Something needs to be addressed at this location. I do not mind a messed up order here and there (stuff happens), but not every time. This location lost my business. P.s. check your drink machine because ontop of forgetting some items, you gave me watered down fruit punch. Actually, more like water with red food coloring in it. I ate your dry chicken biscuit with no chick-fil-a sauce and no drink. Thought I was at Popeyes."}
{"text":"Always loved my morning breakfast from chic fil a. I went recently to find out the one and only decent item has been discontinued!? the spicy chicken biscuit of all things!? come on :( unfortunately I have no more business to do here"}
{"text":"This particular establishment's staff has noticeably great attitude/service. Uniquely accommodating with a sense hospitality which is rare for a \"Fast Food\" venue. Praises for the owner/manager. The food is what you would except from a Chick-Fil-A, attitude/service is where this place puts itself ahead"}
{"text":". Came to Chick-fil-A for lunch today had to listen to one of the employees talk consistently Non-Stop about nothing. Looked at Food on the floor for about 10 minutes with 5 people walking around not picking it up. Also watched one employee with her back to the counter while customers were standing there completely rude and disrespectful. Employees seem to be more concerned about gossiping and talking to each other then actually dealing with customers and making their experience Pleasant. Two employees seem to be the only outstanding workers at this restaurant,Sydney and Allision. The last thing lacking was the my pleasure usually given when someone saying thank you I have not heard it one time since being here."}
{"text":"They staff is always so polite & the salads are always fresh. They raise the bar for fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Clean and tidy.  Fast and fresh food. Drive thru lane often has two or more workers during rush times."}
{"text":"Welcome to Las Vegas, Chick-fil-a and all that hype that comes with it. We tried many items on your menu: Chick-fil-a Nuggets (and the grilled ones), Chicken-n-Strips, Chick-fil-a Chicken Salad Sandwich, Chick-fil-a Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap  and waffle fries and they were all fantastic! Welcome to this neighborhood and we sure will be back to have more of your delicious meals!"}
{"text":"The staff is very kind. The food was quick and fresh. Very clean restaurant and restrooms.
Will repeat my visit."}
{"text":"Wanted to not like this place but ok it's delicious. And I love that they have a play place for little kiddos. Gave me some time to relax."}
{"text":"The drive-thru line is always long! But if you decide to walk in, you're looking at less than 5 mins standing in line. Maybe another 5 to get your meal (which they bring out to you). Customer Service is the best, I've seen in Vegas! There is someone always walking around (checking on you enough not to be a pest). Their manager (I'm assuming the guy in a regular shirt w/glasses) is amazing! Food is Great! I been twice in the last week! Just for the great food and even better customer service."}
{"text":"I was in the drive-thru line before the restaurant opened. They opened at 6am, I ordered two number ones. One for me and one for my coworker. When I got to my destination, (work) we started to open our food and I was disappointed. The biscuits were not done, they were undercooked. And the hash browns were stuck & smashed together. I'm always disappointed when I pay for food and I get it, it's not edible. Chick-fil-A stands out from the other of \"fast food\" restaurants. Chick-fil-A does better so I expect better. I mean don't give me what you wouldn't eat yourself. The only thing I was able to enjoy was the drink."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to go for a chicken sandwich. The lines for the drive-thru move pretty quick, but the way its set up it blocks people trying to get their cars out of their parking space. Everything is quick, tastes great. I wont go anywhere else for a fast food chicken sandwich. Only 4 stars because of the parking interfering with the drive thru lines."}
{"text":"Great food as usual but the service at this location is not what you expect from a    chic-fil-a."}
{"text":"Ugh. Bad service, bad food. I was at an appt. over here and I decided to go I for lunch! Bad decision!"}
{"text":"By far the best experience I've had at a chicfila. Very loud and excited employees. All greated us with a huge smile. Walked to the front of the line and it turned into a comedy show staring I'm assuming the General Manager who I think is Rex Ryan twin brother. Food was extremely fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Today my wife and I visited this store for lunch. After receiving our order I noticed a hair attached to the breading on my spicy chicken sandwich. I took it up to the counter for another sandwich. The manager not only gave me another sandwich he gave me my money back for that combo that I purchased, and a card for another free sandwich in the future. This is what I call great customer service. My hat is off to Chick Fil A. I have had this happen to me before and the restaurant  just gave me another meal, and no refund. Andrew S. was right this is the best Chick Fil A in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Service is at a new low at this location. My last three orders have been wrong or missing items. I ate in today to kill some time and my grilled sandwich had the wrong cheese and no honey BBQ sauce. Extremely irritating after spending nearly $10 and get two things wrong on one order.  You would think with 15 college aged kids they could get a single order correct. Guess not. Plus, the concentration on the drive-thru leaves in-store customers waiting lengthy times. I had 2 folks in front of me and waited about 8-9 minutes before my order was taken. Ridiculous. 

Fortunately, I have moved away from this location and won't have to deal with this continued incompetence. 

Good luck to the owners. You should be in a little more often to see the lunacy. However, being this location is prime real estate, people will continue to forgive and forget. Not me..."}
{"text":"all i see are random complaints on here about things that could be avoided . people, check your order to make sure you received everything you ordered, BEFORE you drive back home. duh!!!!! and if your wallet is hungry for cash then PLEASE, this is a new decade, go online and check the prices too see if you can afford it, complaining about prices and missed food is something that can be avoided!!!! use your head!!!! kudos too this chick fil a team. keep on keeping on!!! you and your management team are doing a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"I just received some of the worst customer service I have ever had at this location's drive thru.  And it was a manager who did it!  I would stay away at any rush hour time as the management does not seem to be up to it or understand decent behavior."}
{"text":"Pleased to give 5 stars always to an establishment that worships on Sunday and encourages employees and us to do the same.

We came in today a party of 8 and 2 grandkids and were waited on by Aamar a fine, polite,patient, and friendly employee. This 5 stars is for him."}
{"text":"Very good shit.   Thanks.   Chicken rules.   I'm going to go back there everyday.  I luv Fatty Fast Food."}
{"text":"I didn't know about this chain until i saw a YouTube video of a drive thru customer being nasty to the cashier. While in AZ, I had to stop at one and to my surprise, this fast food restaurant puts the competition to shame."}
{"text":"I placed an order on the mobile app 30 minutes before I went to lunch(11:30ish). Drive the 15 minutes to chick fil a(45minuntes into the order). Get to chick fil a to find out my 3 meal order isn't ready yet. It takes another 10minutes for them to bring me my order only for me to leave without my drinks they forgot to give me. So 15 minutes back to work, then 15 minutes back to chick fil a to pick up the drinks.. poor execution on their part. Then the guy offers me three free cookies, no thanks! Obviously going to keep eating at chick fil a but not at this location I'll drive the two extra miles to Afton."}
{"text":"This use to be the best place I knew! until they started messing up my order, even giving me the wrong sauces. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Marco was the most polite and great guy ever he even had a lil fun sliding our cards:)"}
{"text":"We are huge Chick Fila fans, but this location seems to be having a difficult start up.  We waiting over 30 minutes in the drive thru line during a time window in between lunch and dinner.  As a result, we have not been back.  We've been driving a little further out of our way to the location near the Chandler mall to ensure more reliable service.  Very disappointing.  Not sure if and when we'll try this location again.  I thought that Chick Fila used to send a team of experienced workers to ensure a smooth transition of newly opened stores...not sure why the opening of this location has been so bumpy."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'd go here every single day if I could afford to. The staff here is ALWAYS super friendly and always eager to help you with anything. The food here is superb, and always fresh :). The fries and milkshakes here are orgasmic. I can't think of anything wrong with this location. I'd reccomend this to anyone:)"}
{"text":"My wife and I are here now and I have to say, this place has absolutely amazing service! Toni was extremely kind and understood our order perfectly. Our food was handed to us as we were paying, which has never happened before. I do expect a wait, especially when there is a line like there was, but it was literally handed to us as we were finishing payment which blew me away. As we were finishing eating, Toni came to our table to offer us a mint and a refill on our drink. Definitely a 5 star rating. Thank you, Toni and the rest of the staff, for an amazing experience here. It made our day that much better!"}
{"text":"ok liked there food but the chicken I got it had hair that wasn't
t mine and it was so loud I left to consetrate but I couldn't focus inside"}
{"text":"I absolutely love chick fil-a. This is like fine dining on a budget.  The owner Ken was wonderful and professional.. It so important to bring religion into a business and more importantly to be closed on sunday to give reverence to god.  More business should consider this practice. 
It so imperative to have a balance and family time."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service. Everyone looked like they hated working there. No one smiled. The restaurant was also quite dirty and not inviting at all. It's just all over was a horrible experience. Food was cold!!! I don't think I will ever be back."}
{"text":"On Tuesday, I had problems ordering on-line for a nuggets tray for NYE. I tried everyday through Friday. Finally, I went in on Friday to order in person. I notified the rep about the inability to order on-line and proceeded to place my order for the next day. I watched her write down my order for a 5pm pickup the next day. My son went to pick it up and they did not have the order.  Not that it wasn't ready but they had no record of my order at all. My son had to call me and so I can place the order again. He had to wait 1 hour and 15 min for them to complete the order.  For $50, we got a small tray equivalent to 4 orders of 8-piece nuggets. On top of that, they didn't even give us any sauces. We couldn't go back and get sauces because they closed early. Never again!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE coming here, their chicken was so much better than everyone else's. The past few times I've gone I've realized their chicken has gone DOWN hill. as in, the majority of my chicken sandwich was fat. As was the majority of the nuggets I got there on a different occasion. Their fries are about the only part of this chain that stayed GOOD. Will return and try again considering \"the third time is a charm\" But I don't have very high hopes."}
{"text":"Tad bit disappointed this morning with the breakfast. Chicken, egg & cheese bagels were bland and seemed to have shrunken in size. Both were ordered regular but one came without the cheese. To our luck as the Mrs. Didn't actually want cheese. The restaurant must not have been wiped down the night before as it was plain to see that the booth walls and backs of chairs were covered in greasy fingers and hand marks. However the highlight was that service was adequate and associates were polite as always."}
{"text":"This location is run well. Employees are always kind and courteous and the one time we had to wait in line they handed us a coupon for a free chicken sandwich. They have never gotten our order wrong and the restaurant is clean. Food is always hot and they stick to chickfila standards for food quality and fast friendly service. This morning we were in line waiting to order we have never ordered breakfast close to 10:30am lunch switch so we called from the line to ask if we could order breakfast before they stopped serving breakfast. They had absolutely no problem and we're kind and courteous over the phone. Good job management and thank you to all the employees. We love the car who comes to the drive through if you have kids every so often :) while chickfila is a tad pricier than other fast food the quality of the food and service are well worth it. This is one of our favorite places to stop if we are in a rush. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's crowded at lunch. Why? It's simply the best quality and service of ANY fast food chain. If you're looking for variety, it's not your spot. For the very best fried chicken sandwich you've ever tasted, you can't go wrong. 

Eat the waffle cut fries right away, they contain no preservatives and aren't as good cold. I really like the Polynesian sauce on mine. 

If you have any problems here, ask for Jamie. He is the manager and super nice young guy."}
{"text":"I usually have positive experiences at all Chick-fil-A's.  However, this one on Camelback and 16th Street is really impressive. The staff is great and the dinning in is clean and comfortable. What really impressed me was the shade and the fans they have outside while you're waiting in the drive thru."}
{"text":"10:32 told me they stopped serving breakfast and threw all the extra away. Worst chick fil a bar none, I'm usually down to drive further to the one on power going toward queen creek but simply didn't have the time. I absolutely won't make that mistake again!"}
{"text":"I write this from the drive thru I. Which I've been in for almost 20 minutes.  Your food is good, this wait is ridiculous.  I've never gotten quick service here.  Other chic fil a's are quick, why can't you be?"}
{"text":"Gone thru drive thru at least two times now.  The second time I went they not only requested back the photo copied menu that looked nothing like the thick card stock color print supplied on grand opening day.  I actually still had my original menu in the car and after they had already asked ( and gotten back the menu from today) continued to try to ask me for a menu previously that was never asked for as if they needed it back.  I find that giving people used menus is a bad business practice.  Never the less I got a spicy chicken sandwich both times and got sick both times.  Maybe it was all the hands that had touched the menus throughout the first couple weeks? :(  either way I ordered a sandwich verbally from a man that I told CHEESE AND MEAT ONLY Plain - and some how the sandwich still ended up with pickles on it.  I didn't get to eat my lunch because of the error and since have not been reimbursed.  It would be nice for the fast food industry to be able to credit people back for food they didn't receive etc - instead of telling them you can stop back in etc.  Previously I had a impression that they don't make mistakes like other places - My last visit proved the point it doesn't matter how much money someone makes or what they are dressed in.  When you want a sandwich to have just cheese and meat on it and nothing else you should always check it before leaving.  No matter how much confidence you have in their team.  Only takes one person to mess the whole order up!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand what the big deal is with people this place is below average Wendy's chicken sandwich is better hell even McDonald's buttermilk chicken sandwich is better the this place don't understand how stupid people are that will wait in a drive thru line for 20 minutes for a chicken sand which like they are at some authentic restaurant plain stupid"}
{"text":"I come here at least 2x a month. The staff are wonderful and friendly, food is delicious. There are almost always long line, but they usually move quickly. My kids love it too!"}
{"text":"Even though being my first time there and it being really crowded it was perhaps the most well organized restaurant I had been to in a while. Food was really delicious and they had great customer service!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a chick fil a. I ordered the cool chicken wrap with creamy salsa dressing on the side & a frosted lemonade. The wrap was quite bland without the dressing, so I was happy I got the creamy salsa to add on. The frosted lemonade was pretty good but not what I expected. I thought it was going to be a slushie type drink but it was basically just a lemon milkshake. It was good just not what I expected. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. The place was PACKED but line moved very quickly. The menu was too bland for my taste. I just expected a bit more considering the hype about this place"}
{"text":"So good. the sandwiches, the salads, the ice cream. and of course, the fries. sooo good. and chik fil a sause is the best. and it is all pretty healthy for you too!"}
{"text":"Fast service good food for the price. I love the grilled chicken sandwich , I will be back."}
{"text":"Best service in a while I feel like I'm in a 5star restaurant! And the only place that had said merry Christmas this year! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Everyone is always so friendly. There today with my daughter...balloon man making treats for the kids, manager helping a lady with a baby with the high chair and placemat, and always coming up asking to refill my drink.  For a fast food restaurant I think this is impressive."}
{"text":"Some of the best fast food chicken sandwiches you'll get. Staff members are always super nice. When I had to wait for my order they gave me a gift card. Good chicken. Love the frozen lemonade."}
{"text":"foods kinda bland, but service is pretty good, i thought the food would be worth the hype. kinda was disappointed on how the food tasted and how much it cost. this place needs traffic lights on Rancho just to exit to turn left is hard and was stuck there for at least 15 mins just to turn left to get on Sahara. in conclusion wouldn't really come back since the food is a bit too expensive and bland, i rather go to other places that taste so much better."}
{"text":"The tastiest fast food chicken around. That being said, it's still fast food. I've visited this location about 15 times in the last few months. Here's what I gather: 
- for being fast food, it's good. Above average and consistent. 
- it's still fast food. Sweet, salty, and a little greasy at times. It's an indulgence. 
- service is fantastic and no fast food joint compares. 
- ambiance/design/feel is incredible. Again, unmatched in the fast food segment 


The food deserves a 3.0 the service and ambiance deserves a 4.6 lets average that out to almost 4 stars."}
{"text":"Young employees and their friends yelling and cursing at the manager in the middle of the dining room over some type of disaster in the women's room...interesting lunch. Drive thru is really slow. Still good food though."}
{"text":"The Mooresville location is THE BEST I have ever been too!  The staff & service is amazing I always leave with a smile :-)"}
{"text":"It's a Chick-fil-A. It's got alright food and decent service, but I've never understood the hype."}
{"text":"Anton was quick and friendly when taking our order.  Food was fast and other staff were friendly and busy keeping a clean environment. Would definitely consider dining in again when I need a quick bit to eat."}
{"text":"Ok,this place is amazing!If you had a stomach ache before,(which I did),I never got one for 2 WHOLE YEARS!!!!And don't get me started on the chicken deluxe...

They have everything from Soup to chicken to sandwiches to salads to you get the point...And they have also a lot of dressing choices,hot sauce,ketchup,ranch,etc.I also want to tell you about their Chick-Fil-A sauce..If you like eccentric/Unusual sauces,it's good.I think many
Would like it either way..

Overall I rate 5 stars.Now,this is \"Overated Review\" but Food is good,not to greasy,AMAZINGLY customer support,and CLEAN restrooms.They also clean every table when the person leaves,and another clean every 5 minutes,so there's that.And the Play Area,(not
5),but I can tell it's amazing,EVERY kid wants to go there,and from the looks of it,it's clean!The drive thru also serves the Best Drive Thru food,and it's exactly if you were to go inside!Also,The cashiers say words like \"Your Welcome\" and have a positive smile that you can't resist!"}
{"text":"pricey but good.
 I have always really liked Chick-Fil-A, but don't eat there a whole lot because they are pricier than the other fast food options out there"}
{"text":"the food was k nothing special but the service. let me just say it was amazing. The waitress named Gigi was a sweet old lady that kept you very entertain and made you feel like you where eating back home with your grandmother. Ive never been a fan of chick filet. But because of Gigi i would definitely come back. Even if its just  to say hello!"}
{"text":"Best chik-fil-a ive ever been to. Very clean, very friendly.  For some reason the food tastes better. Next time im around this area i will stop here again"}
{"text":"Tried calling in an order at Chik Fil a in Tempe at least 10 times while driving into work.  It was a catering order, so I knew it was going to take a while to prepare.  The call goes straight to an answering machine.  When I got to the store.  Manager stated.  Yep. We are short handed.  So if I took that call.  We would be that much further backed up.  My daughter works for Chik Fil A...no way would this be acceptable at her location. Attached receipt if anyone at Corp would like to now more details."}
{"text":"I think their chicken nuggets are so good. The people that work there DIDNT look gross. The girl that took my order was very pretty( but to young for my taste."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! I have zero complaints- because they are always fully staffed and the line always moves quickly. They have a good system here."}
{"text":"We love the family friendly atmosphere of Chik Fil A. The customer service is always professional and the employees know how to greet and treat their customers. They offer quality food at a fair price.  We are happy to give them our business."}
{"text":"Really like the lay out of the new Chik Fil A on 59th and Thunderbird. Staff is amazing and friendly and do a fantastic job of making your experience here enjoyable."}
{"text":"Love chik fil a! It's definitely my family and I's go to fast food spot. The two stars isn't for the food it's for the fact that every time I've ever gone through this drive thru they always mess up my order. Whether they forgot my fries, the sauce, or the drink. It's something every time! Being a mom I don't have time to run inside and grab the food so it's really disappointing that they always forget something. Just went there today and I asked for two medium fries. And they gave me just one and the person who was taking my order even asked me twice!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst drive thru experience I have ever had!! We ordered our food from a girl standing in the drive thru and she was pleasant and polite. We got to the window and payed for our meals. After they gave us our fries and my sons kids meal we waited for 5 minutes before they told us they ran out of bread for the chicken salad sandwiches. Then we told them to just put them on buns so we could leave. While waiting for them to get us our sandwiches we got to listen to two teenage girls talk about \"who was having sex with who\" in their group of friends. Definitely what I want my wife and son to hear while I'm still upset over them messing up my delicious sandwiches. Beyond disappointed in you Chick Fil A."}
{"text":"After already charging me 8.25 for a smallish salad they wanted to charge .60 for an extra salad dressing and also for a cup of water. SO LAME. No other Chick-fil-a  does that. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Chick fil a! I had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo and wifey had the regular Chicken Sandwich combo. Absolutely Delicious! Service was spectacular as well. We will be back again, soon!"}
{"text":"Got to give the South Blvd location 3 stars, against the benchmark location (Cotswold). Staff, wait time, and cleanliness are decent; but far from exceptional"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm writing a review for a Chick-fil-a, but the service was excellent! It is large, clean, and the workers are smiling and very polite. The training manager helped me with an order for a platter and coffee traveler and I can see why he is in charge. Keep us the great work!"}
{"text":"I drive all over the metro Phoenix and surrounding. All chick fil a's I have been to have good customer service and great food.  However,  the Deer Valley and Surprise location are too conservative with their condiments. The Arrowhead 83 location seems more inviting and welcoming.  Seeing sauces sugars creamers full and stocked (not having to ask), just feels more welcoming.  When given the choice I will pass on the other 2 but will definitely make the Arrowhead 83rd and Bell my location to visit."}
{"text":"No matter what time of day, the drive-thru is always full, which is always a good sign.  I'm rarely dissappointed & my son loves the play area. I wish their milkshakes weren't so good, as I'm addicted to the strawberry shake!"}
{"text":"Moldy juice boxes in the kids meal. The manager Michael said he would refund the kids meal, but not the other items. Said sometimes things \"slip through the cracks.\"  Ruined lunch at school with grandma, but they didn't seems surprised or like they cared."}
{"text":"Always a great time at chick-fil-a. Food is delicious as usual and the staff super friendly and ready to help! This time there was no music on though. Who knew I'd miss the uplifting music while I ate my chicken sandwich and fries! This is always a go to for lunch when we are crunched for time!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the fascination with Chick-fil-A.  I do like the whole marketing thing they do with the cows trying to prevent people from murdering them and convincing us to murder chickens instead - that's good fun, but the food isn't spectacular.

I have now consumed a total of THREE chicken sandwiches from this location. They were all tasty, don't get me wrong, but it's less of a sandwich, and more of 'A piece of chicken in a bun'. There's just not much to it, and it results in some bites that have little or no chicken, and some that have a ton.  There's no sauce, no lettuce, no tomato - it's pretty uneventful.  Maybe I need to order a different sandwich, but I don't feel like there's anything 'deluxe' about lettuce.

To their credit, this location is fast, and the people are friendly. I'd rather have a chicken sandwich from Wendy's though."}
{"text":"Good in a pinch. Not my favorite thing in the world and with 5 guys opening across the street they'll definitely be seeing less of me, but overall nice to have around, although I always seem to crave it on Sundays."}
{"text":"I stopped by this morning and there was a long line in the drive thru so I decided to go inside since there was no one inside..I figured it'd be a shorter wait (I was on the way to work). I was wrong. 

I placed my order for a breakfast burrito (that's it). After I placed my order a few people, approximately 6, placed their order after me. Well orders started coming out and they were calling everyone's nar except mine. So after a while everyone ahead of me received their order except me. As I had mentioned, I was on the way to work. Feeling a little frustrated, I asked \"how long will it be for my order?\", the worker replied, \"they're warming it up now\".....warming it up?!..if they're warming it up, it should not take that long...

I looked over to the drive thru window and the car that would've been 3 cars behind me if I would have waited in the drive thru line, received their order. 

Long story short, if you want your food faster, just wait in the long line in the drive thru bc apparently you'll get your food faster than waiting with no one in line inside."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd receive rude service at a chick fil A but I was wrong!  I did not hear one thank you or my pleasure from the 7 front end workers I saw. Not good for your brand!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Friendly staff. There's nothing like the original sandwich!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the chicken biscuit, but the reason I keep going back is the coolest staff on earth. I'm on a first name basis with the entire window crew, mostly because, if I'm going to miss the 10:30 breakfast cut-off, I call on my way, and Jessica, Michelle, Danielle, Nick or Damon will say \"is this you Chris?\" and set a couple aside for me.  They're amazing and courteous and I love this place because of them."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Chick-Fil-A in Charlotte, I travel around Charlotte and hands down this is the best.  They never forget to give you silverware, condiments or extra pickles on your sandwich.  The chicken on the sandwiches is always large the lettuce in the salads are fresh.  I just stopped at the Chick-Fil-A on Rea Road and Audrey Kell because it was closer to where I was and the lettuce in the salad was wilted.  They usually forget something and aren't as friendly."}
{"text":"Chicken nuggets are very dry and salty .Bad experience. Edk!"}
{"text":"Man I love a good chick-fil-A sandwich! The secret is to put the Polynesian sauce on the sandwich! Mmm-mm good! This Chick-fil-A is a really nice and neat location and it has a really cool kids area! (in its own room so noise is at a minimum) Give it a try! Not open Sundays!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here! I had the spicy chicken sandwhich. So good! So fresh! Server so pleasant!!"}
{"text":"Great until recently.  They stopped giving trays or placemats off of which to eat.  Instead you relegated to eating directly off the table or your paper \"to go\" bag."}
{"text":"All chick-fil-a's are awesome but on my visit today they were taking orders in person super customer service especially considering it was drizzling rain on & off. Great job folks!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Chick-Fil-A before, but I expected it to be like any other fast food place. Boy, was I in for a surprise! We were greeted coming in the door and the people that helped us were quick and very nice. They even brought our food out to us. My son had a blast playing in their little toddler area, too. With service and an atmosphere like that (not to mention the food was really good), how could you not go back?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food place. Everybody is nice and helpful  (at least at this location). Place gets crowded at lunchtime,  but some how they handle it. Food is great and always cooked  (not like some other fast-food places).  A lot of big names in restaurants should take notes from this guys."}
{"text":"My fav place, great outstanding service! Food to me is amazing & I love there watermelon lemonade so good & refreshing! Very clean place & always a smile on everyone's face when you walk in."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant with great friendly chick fil a employees! Food was up to standard with other chains! Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich combo and it was quite delicious as usual! Even though the restaurant was packed I received my food very quickly! Great lunch experience and would recommend to others!!"}
{"text":"This place is such a great place to get food the workers are nice and effective and the food is never burnt I just can't explain how good it is. The only reason it got 4 stars was because it can get crowed because so many people go there to eat"}
{"text":"This is a model Chick Fil A.  You could power a small neighborhood with the wattage of the smiles among the staff.  Always clean, always fast, always accurate in order fulfillment.  Just a very well run unit."}
{"text":"The owners here are awesome, and they run a model Chick-Fil-A.  Dependable, friendly ... and, as always, that fantastic (as far as fast food goes) product."}
{"text":"Chick Fil A is awful! A friend took me here for breakfast. I hate fast food but went. The chicken was terrible (and terrible for you)!! It tasted like vat oil. That's it. Terrible quality meat, everything soaked in salt and grease. It would be healthier to eat Krispy Kreme donuts!! What a lame excuse for a meal. Never eat Chic Fil A again!"}
{"text":"I love chicken fil A but no the one on 44th st and indian school today for the 3rd time they did something wrong  i askd for 8 pc chx nuggets and they 5 regular pc and 3 of them were so tinny! 1st time they put pickes on my sandwich! And i ordered with put it! 2nd they didnt give me sauce, napkins, and instade of niggets they give me strips! U need to check everything before! Thanks!! But food its DELICIOSAAAA!!!"}
{"text":"Love love this place and so does my Nana. Hot and fresh,The sauces are an extra bonus! Will come back. Spicy chicken sandwich all the way."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice. So far really good! Waffle fries are really good!
Sauce is the best!
Platter has a good portion!"}
{"text":"Worst chick fil a I've ever been to....  Yes this is chickfila express but its the same items as any chickfila but worse. I worked in the area so would come here all the time (only cuz it was fast and ready) . 
The sandwiches are always soggy, the bread will be \"smooshed\" and wet from sitting in the wrapping and the chicken is devoid of any taste.. Also I once had a sandwich halfway uncooked no joke. The fries are decent but its the sandwiches that don't have that chikfila quality taste, this is a step below any other chick filA. I would go for the nuggets as they aren't so bad and the chicken mini bisquits in the morning are decent. 
Another odd thing is that they have the bags near the cashier (last step). That means if you want to take something to go, you'll need to carry it in your bare hands... If there is any sort of line at the cash register that extends beyond the \"bag pickup\" enjoy holding steaming hot fries and nuggets in your hand for who knows how long the line moves at a snails pace during peak time.  So a tip- if you're Getting to-go and theres a line at the cash register, skip the line and grab a bag BEFORE you pick up your food, otherwise your hands will be have 1st degree burns from holding hot food. Its weird but they laid out the bags oddly (poor management)

Place overall is just not worth it unless you have no time to wait for food at places like the bytes cafeteria nearby , this will be quick so it has that going for it i guess. I'd rather take the food to go because the place is usually loud and bustling and will oddly sometimes smell like soapy from being cleaned I assume (which could be a good thing as at least their cleaning the place)"}
{"text":"The food was hot, fresh, and delicious! The drive thru process was quick for us. One guy showed us a menu, took our order on a tablet and also swiped our card at that time. We drove around to a booth where we were given our receipt. Then at the window there was another person outside who handed us our food from the window. We ordered 2 chicken sandwich meals which came out to be 14 and change. Everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"I love the mini nuggets on the sweet breakfast biscuits! But since finding this last year that I have a severe digestive reaction when eating corn, I have been cautious about eat out. I asked the girl at the window if there was any corn meal in the chicken breading. She said she didn't think so but would check. She actually printed a list of all the ingredients for me!!! Oh my goodness! I was so happy. She looked a bit shocked by my glee- which is kinda funny in itself because the would chick fil A, my pleasure business.... but apparently it's common and not a problem. ( I tried to get a list of ingredients at other places and it just wasn't available) I'm so happy that I can add a safe place to eat on my list. Food allergies are so difficult and having a place that doesn't shame customers for asking is a huge positive. Plus my little biscuit nuggets were delicious!"}
{"text":"Before I start this review...you should know, my husband and I love Chick-Fil-A so much...when we lived in Kansas City, bought an entire CASE of honey roasted BBQ sauce packets from the local franchise there, so we could grill chicken sandwiches and re-create them at home!  (Alas, we never did finish the entire case, and should have given some away.)

Chick-Fil-A is one of my favorite, if not favorite \"fast food\" chain because the chicken is fresh and the service is always A+. Never have I had a wrong order going through the drive through, or been treated rudely.  Even first thing in the morning at 6:30am, the drive through server is chipper and says \"my pleasure\"! 

(I should say, when I worked in KC, I did a story with a Chick-Fil-A owner, and he told me the owners and managers pray before hiring someone, to ask God if the person is a right fit.  It may some outrageous to some, but I tell you, it must work.  The people who work at every CFA location I've been to are incredibly polite and hard working.) 

Faves...the chargrilled chicken sandwich, original (both deluxe w/lettuce and tomato) and for breakfast, the chicken burrito.  I also think the unsweetened iced tea here is the best out of McDonald's, Wendy's and every other drive through iced tea.

PS:  Enclosed is a photo of me during Cow Appreciation day, when I put on some black spots, and got myself a free sandwich! NO SHAME!"}
{"text":"Was on vacation, heading off  to the ocean, wanted to get a lure at Bass Pro Shops, saw this restaurant and decided to find out what all the hoopla is all about.  I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich meal replete with the waffle fries. I had never had either.  I had never been in Chick-Fil-A, either.  The lady behind the counter told me she would bring me my order.  Okay, that's a twist, a fast food joint bringing out your food. I guess not the only one that does that, but far and few between.  She arrived with my order but not my cup of coffee.  She pointed over to a coffee pot - my bad, didn't see it, thought she was bringing everything to me.  No, no, she says, I'll get it for you.  She went and got the next size larger than what I ordered and brought it to me.
The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious.  Wow type of delicious.  The waffle fries were good, too.  I kind of like my fries a bit crunchier but they were tasty and they certainly can hold the ketchup in those waves that are created in them.  The restaurant area was immaculate.  It was an \"experience\" in itself.  I'm definitely going to start frequenting Chick-Fil-A more often."}
{"text":"CHICK-FIL-A IS AWESOME.  I absolutely love this place. The food is awesome and my quote for you is \"eat mor chicken\""}
{"text":"I'm never coming to this location again.  The lady literally burped the second she opened the window to give me the food. She also gave me the wrong order and I didn't get a chance to look at it until I got home. I called to let them know they gave me the wrong order and the manager offered to fix the order if I drove back to the location,  but it wasn't worth my gas money to drive back."}
{"text":"The people are always so nice! Kimberly is especially amazing! You can tell customer service is a priority."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed the the service I received at this location this morning. I usually come here multiple times a week for lunch and am always satisfied but today I came for breakfast instead. I pulled up right before 10:30am and ordered my breakfast item. Pull up to the window 5 mins later to be told that they ran out of the item I ordered. Now, because it's after 10:30, they don't have any other breakfast items besides a burrito and bacon egg and cheese sandwich. I came to chick fil a for chicken not bacon. I told the girl at the window that neither of those items would work for me and she said \"Sorry\".. Didn't offer me a coupon or anything for my breakfast tomorrow. I'm extremely upset with the way this was handled. And now because it's after 10:30 I can't even go to another location to get my breakfast! So annoying!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is friendly and attentive.  Chick-Fil-A is SO gay."}
{"text":"Really good food. Sometimes they are a little busy but it's worth it.

They have the most friendliness staff I've ever met. I love that they always end with \"my pleasure \" and seem to actually like their jobs. Why wouldn't they, they're  serving quality foods."}
{"text":"Politics aside...what's not to like about Chick-Fil-A?  The food is great and the workers must be trained to be helpful and pleasant.  A playground for the kids gives the parents a chance to talk amongst themselves.

Most people cut through the gas station next door to enter the parking lot...this is an accident waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Their food is good, and the sides are good.   

Now, on to the big 3:

Price:  Pretty typical, and non-effective in correcting the high prices of fast food.  A single diner can expect to pay $8-11 to eat one meal.  I'm guessing that no energy is expended to correct the high prices of one dinner meal.

Service:  Everyone I've talked to has been pleasant, and smiling, if even on an only-superficial basis.

Taste:  The chicken items taste just like chicken.  It's everything you would expect.  Nothing fantastic.

In Summation:  They close as early as 9pm, and ALSO on every Sunday."}
{"text":"This is our favorite location in the valley! The employees are super nice and helpful. Especially for a busy mom like me with a handful of kids. It's mostly frequentedIt's mostly frequented by business folks in the area, so the playground is not that busy."}
{"text":"Chick FilA is one of the best fast food restaurants out there. They have really worked on the friendly-ness factor. BUT...This particular location has the most languid bunch of workers I've ever seen. I saw four people walk out because the 7 people working behind the counter didn't step up to wait on the customers -- they were too BUSY doing other stuff like paperwork, and stacking cups. 

When it was my turn, I waited at the counter for 5 to 7 minutes in awe of the complete lack of service. Only one cash register was open while four more customers behind me waited to get somebody - anybody's attention. Plenty of employees were there all milling about and chatting amongst themselves. Hello???

Is there anything more important than the customers? Here's a case where they have gone out of their way to provide decent fast food, a clean environment, small extras like diapers in the bathrooms, fresh flowers, and great attitude by the employees, but then FORGOT to take their orders. I won't go back to this one."}
{"text":"I am not exaggerating when I say this: best fast food experience I have ever had. The staff member taking our order was kind and courteous, our food was ready before we had even found a table, the waitstaff was kind and even gave us a free drink because we looked thirsty. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The best fast food chicken out there!  Very consistent every time I visit.  These guys simply know how to cook chicken right.  

Four stars for a fast food drive through is top notch in my opinion."}
{"text":"Offers the same great service that every chick-fil-a delivers. Great people, great food! Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and \"It's always a beautiful day at Chik-Fil-A\"!!  I love that every time I go through the drive thru, they give my dog a dog biscuit."}
{"text":"Clean, overly friendly staff (my pleasure!!) and nice extras during Family Night Tuesdays. Drive thru always packed and breakfast items come out painfully slowly.  Best Chick around though."}
{"text":"Great customer service, always friendly and polite!   Food is delicious and fresh.  Happy to have this only a few miles from home!"}
{"text":"I love a good chicken sandwich and ordered two of them for my brother and myself with a fry and a drink!  

His sandwich was fine and he ate it all!  However my other sandwich had some very nasty chicken and was extremely unappetizing for me to enjoy and I threw all of it out!  
I was very displeased and called the new owner of the place the next day to let him know that it was a bad experience for me!  He said he would take care of it when I came in the day i called!   
He was extremely rude and seemed like he didn't want to refund my transaction so I just asked for another sandwich to try it again and he comped it for me.  This time it was ok and not as nasty!   
I will never return to this place again and don't recommend it due to this experience.  
The fries and drinks were great though!  Horrible new owner!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best chick fil a I have gone to my service is always fast and amazing!!"}
{"text":"First impression is slow. At lunch the drive through is wrapping around the building.  Inside service is not much faster.  The food is fine. Standard for the chain. Clean and a good place for families. Calories provided and a variety of choices make eating here healthy.  A good place if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Staff is awesome and my kids love it. We've never had anything bad. They also do some really neat activities with the kids on special nights."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat. Food is always fresh and warm. Been coming here for years and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"The place is always packed I don't get it!! It's overpriced fast food. Portions are small. You can go to Viva Chicken get real fresh chicken of the bone for the same price but the portions are 2x the size. Your full when you are done eating. I never feel full after eating here. Yes the staff is friendly, but food is just average and the prices are not what you would expect for fast food...."}
{"text":"As always good food what you expect but this location Is one of the slowest I haver ever been to. Typically the drive thru is backed up. One morning arrived to wait for breakfast rounds. Seriously waiting at 7 30 am to get breakfast rounds. Hate to hate but slow service and bad service has become the norm and we all too often just accept it."}
{"text":"Okay... I'm going to be really nice with this one. There is nothing worse though thing going through the drive-through, ordering $40 worth of food, being extremely specific as to what sauces you need included in your order... And then finding out when you return to work with everyone's order that they did not give you what you ask for.  That makes for really bad office relations.

So I'm giving four stars because I love Chick-fil-A. I am the very frustrated with this being the second time this is happened in a three week period.

Pull it together Chick-fil-A... pull it together."}
{"text":"Very clean, friendly staff, great food, has kids playground.  It was busy but still had a excellent expeirence. As a side note (some people might not know this) you can trade in your unopened kids meal toys for ice-cream.  I believe all Chick-Fil-a do this."}
{"text":"Good food as expected but too crowded and did not feel efficient. As with any chick fil a I can respect their focus on customer service but many times it gets in the way of customer service.   Getting a refill during lunch hours is quite a task and the parking lot is just plain dangerous.  In fact the biggest drawback to this location is the parking and parking lot.  Adds unnecessary stress to lunch."}
{"text":"Eat a lot of these and this is consistently worst location in the area.  Staff is very slack and not concerned.  That \"my pleasure\" we're all used to is robotic at best.   Every other visit something is wrong with our order where this never occurs at other locations.   Has to be the poorest managed location in area and possibly country."}
{"text":"Very freindly ,attentive cashiers. As far as the food I ordered the spicy chicken sandwhich...pretty good and my daughter the nuggets a lil too small if you ask me but my babygirl has a pretty big appetite for her size lol so maybe thats why.  but i think the hype was a lil over exaggerated. I prefer the chicken from pdq preferably . Experience wise it was very nice. Manager checked on us to see if everything was ok. ....and it was . :)"}
{"text":"Worst Chick Fil A ever!!! Been at this location either going to or from Costco in Charlotte. I have no issue with staff but the sandwiches are cut in half , nuggets are tiny. I do know this is to cut costs. I have yet to ever get a receipt. The machine is down or it will take 5 min . To change the tape. Really!!! At 1030 am a receipt tape should not be empty. No longer going to this location .. One at Whitehall and on cheery rd in York. Bye !! You sux!!"}
{"text":"I just left there...the food is good as always, and the customer service was GREAT!   I should have made a note of their names...so nice! And very clean..."}
{"text":"POOR QUALITY FROM A NAME I TRUST !!! I went in at 6:35am. The drive through line was about 8 cars deep, and yeah....it was 6:35 in the morning. I had just left the gym and figured I'd stop by the gym to grab a quick power sandwich.  When I pulled up to order, I was greeted by a voice that was reminiscent of a agonizing, and painful drone that I had heard on a war movie some years back. Only thing was the guy in that movie was dying, this person was simply taking my order. Just to speak to someone who sounded so miserable & unenthused completely drained me. Oh, and yeah...it was 6:35 in the morning. So I went against my better judgement and ordered 2 egg white and chicken muffins (no cheese). Since this is \"fast food\" I decided to open the sandwich up and eat it in my car. YAYYY AMERICA FOR THE BLESSINGS OF FAST FOOD ! I was greeted by a burnt muffin, blackened chicken, and a sliver of egg that seemed like it had probably had been delivered by the mother hen 2 weeks premature. (I like eggs, so Im not a fan of egg slivers). I was immediately taken back when  I took a bite of the sandwich that was filled with carcinogens (not a fan of consuming that) . So I decided to go in and ask for new food. I walked in and was greeted by what some call a manager ? I politely placed my carcass on the counter and showed the \"manager\" my concern. She saw the burnt muffin, the burnt chicken, and the egg slivers. When I told her that I wanted new ones she immediately said that,\" Our toaster is set up to make them that way\"! UHHHH, NO. I threw both of them out and demanded new sandwiches. After all, I remember a time when my 7 year old daughter made me breakfast in bed once. How delightful it was to have perfectly toasted and buttered english muffins on that occasion. Oh well, she was 7 then. Cant complain about the past, rite ? So here I am dealing with a grown woman who seemingly thinks that burnt food is OK to sell & serve. Now we all know: Chick-fil-A is not cheap. I mean I think about how much 18 eggs cost, a bag of english muffins, a tub of butter, and a package of thin sliced chicken breasts. I spent  $14.67 on some sandwiches and yogurt and was made to feel shamed about actually complaining about my burnt food. THIS PLACE SUCKS and I will never go back. Why ? Not because of the poor service, or pricing, or even long lines. But because the management there thinks that selling burnt food is ok, and that it is also a unapologetic event. I will not knowingly contribute my hard earned money to fund the employment of morons (unless its the U.S. government)."}
{"text":"We just love Chick Fil A, but this location is our favorite! Every time we come here my boys and I are always greeted by JERRY...he usually opens the door for us. He is always friendly, courteous, helpful, hardworking, and attentive to this busy mom's needs. I always mean to write a review so I can brag on him. I see him act the same way with other customers. I truly believe it's just his nature! Employee of the week..the month..the year...for sure in my book! Thank you Jerry for your positivity and dedication!!! We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A, what has happened? I thought you prided yourself on great service? 

Well, this location needs some help. I will say that they do a great job when they are slow, but boy when they are busy, they fail to keep up. Severely. I've never had the same issues at other locations. 

Today, I ordered through the mobile app, which I have been doing for some time now. It's typically faster than waiting in line, and I have a very short period for lunch. For those of you who do not know, the mobile app lets you know when you're order is ready, but just Iike all the other dine-in orders, you get a table marker and they bring it out to you. 

WELL, this is now the third time I have waited at least 5 mins (if not more) after the app says my order is ready for them to bring it out. After 5 minutes of patiently waiting, I decided to go up to the counter and check on it. Lo and behold, it is just sitting on the counter getting ignored while other orders are being brought out. 

Not sure if I'm cursed, but I reiterate this is the THIRD time my order was ready and just got ignored. The cashier today said \"I think they were looking for you but didn't see you\", but no, I was watching; they never came out with it. 

I'd understand if this was the first mishap, but I felt obligated to write a review as this is the THIRD time this has happened. Third time's a charm, eh? 

FYI - I write this as I am having to scarf down my food at my desk while my boss isn't watching - wasn't able to eat at the restaurant bc it took too long to get my food."}
{"text":"This was an overall great experience! The individual taking our order was very friendly. The food was super as well! Another individual came by when we were at our table for about 10 minutes to make sure everything was tasting OK and to see if he could get us anything else. When we were done with the meal and sitting talking, he came by again and got our trays and took our garbage from the table. As we were walking out we got a refill and super friendly service again. The restrooms are clean and the store in general has a welcoming feeling. The AC didn't make the environment uncomfortable either which was nice. Highly recommend this restaurant. I felt like tipping even though it isn't really that type of restaurant."}
{"text":"After a 1-star experience at the store on stephanie I decided to try this one. Boy was that a bad idea as the service here was even worse and the food again about as bland as you can get. I do not understand the hype?"}
{"text":"Bad service, bland food. Thought it would be better considering this is the IN place to eat. Overall about as disappointing as it could get. Oh well."}
{"text":"I am highly disappointed in the size of the chicken strips and nuggets. The skimpy pieces not only happen at this location, but at other locations. 
I feel so cheated out of the a nearly $10 meal when the strips are the same size as my short skinny finger. 
The fries and the employees were great. 
However, please quit cheating the customers on the tiny pieces of chicken, this is unacceptable.
I do not plan on returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I placed an order on the app for the curbside service. I placed the order and clicked on the arrived button. It thought for about 8 minutes saying it was preparing then finally clicked it was ready. No one came out I waited two minutes and went in. A rude girl at the register where it says mobile pick up said \"you have to click the button\". And did not further acknowledge me. I waited another 4 minutes standing there no one said anything. Then another girl got my order and walked past me and outside. Time from order on app and arrived to pick up 26 minutes!
I could have walked right in ordered from the register and been gone in less than 5! Couldn't believe the rude girl next to mobile pickup"}
{"text":"Good food, great prices and well managed. 

The dining area is always kept well cleaned despite being busy during rush hours, and the restrooms are also immaculate.

Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had never been to Chick-fil-A before and never understood what all of the hype was about. I went there for lunch yesterday and it was wow. Now I know. Despite crowds of people inside the restaurant as well as in line service was really quick and waiting times extremely short. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich with fries and buffalo wing sauce as well as the sweetened ice tea. You're given a vase looking thing at the register that you can use to fill with your sauces and any other condiments you might need at your table. And their condiment options are great. They have Heinz Ketchup (not generic kind), Hellman's mayo, concord grape jelly etc. Once I sat down I thought it would be great to have some ranch sauce to go along with my sandwich and conveniently the lady who brought my food to the table asked if I needed anything else. I asked for the sauce and within what seemed like a second someone else brought me the sauce. Talk about fast service. The food itself was really tasty and the entire meal with drink cost less than $8. My chicken sandwich was hot and crispy and not too greasy. The bun was fresh. The ice tea was delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just experienced the drive thru...they are doing a great job keeping everything moving!"}
{"text":"Waited in the drive-thru line for 5 minutes then was told that I had to go inside for today's promo deal.  Waited in the drive-thru line another 5 minutes to get out.

{"text":"Server at drive thru window did not exhibit the qualities nor standards this company is known for. She appeared stressed and unfriendly.  I had ordered an ice cream cone, in a cup, because I was driving and by myself. She brought it to me in some sort of mini tray and was rude when I requested again for it to be in a cup. She did not apologize, or say anything to me. She literally threw the one in the tray into the trash. I watched as a new cone was being made and a co-worker of hers looked back at me a couple of times. It was obvious she was talking about me, why I'm not sure. I thanked her when my order was complete. She never smiled, said \"my pleasure\", nothing. It was disappointing because good food, good service and friendly employees have kept me coming back for years."}
{"text":"Yum fresh fried chicken and for all of you that don't know it they hand batter it all them selfs! The peach milkshake is the best but it is only seasonal!"}
{"text":"I was delighted to have my chicken strips and chips. We also tried the chicken soup, but I wouldn't order it again--nothing bad, just nothing special about it. The service was great, and the place was spotless."}
{"text":"Always a good experience here. They have signs in the drive thru to let you know they want to be the fastest Chick Fil A drive thru and I believe it :)"}
{"text":"Great team of employees, smiling faces, polite and helpful when dining with children! Food is always hot and fresh. The original sandwich is delicious, unlike any other chicken sandwich. Easy access off 77 at exit 25."}
{"text":"Great food. Great value. Great fast service. Great people. My favorite fast food restaurant on the planet. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Not the standard Chick-fil-a! Most Chick-fil-a restaurants are exceptionally clean and have awesome customer service, but this location is more on the level of a McDonald's. After multiple visits to this location over the past few years, it seems like I always leave with a bad taste in my mouth.  Not because my my experience was bad; more because it was just average and didn't reach the expectations that I have become accustomed to from other Chick-fil-a restaurants."}
{"text":"Best fast food chicken restaurant. I am always impressed by the friendly and courteous staff, clean dining area, and delicious food. This location definitely caters to families, and even has extra diapers in the restroom in case of an emergency and/or forgotten diaper bag. I loved the food, and definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I came here last night and the lady taking my order just wasn't paying attention unfortunately.. I received my order and it was wrong. This is the closest Chick-fil-A from dove valley. By the time I got home I saw my order was wrong and received the wrong sizes. I've never had a complaint with this fast food place, hopefully next time the person taking our order pays attention and I won't be upset to find everything is wrong and a waste of my money."}
{"text":"I always wonder why more fast food places, especially major chains, don't offer Wi-Fi to their customers in this day and age. Who are these CEOs? I eat fast food as little as possible; but let's face it, when you're on the go and you're hungry, sometimes you have no choice. What brought me to Chick-fil-A? Wi-Fi. Why I will look no further next time? I have never received such service at a fast food restaurant in my life. Highlights: Wi-Fi, USA Today, they bring the food to your table, the staff are all competent and friendly. Some quotes, \"the straws are going to be right behind you Mr. Kellar...have a seat anywhere and we'll be right with you.\" \"Here you go sir, do you have everything you need?\" and the reason for this yelp, \"Can I get you a complementary refill while you work?\" (as she cleans my table mind you). Are you kidding? Where am I? Isn't this fast food. Props to the team at this location and to Chick-fil-A. Some CEOs know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the hype about this place. My friend and I went today for the first time to try this supposed amazing food...well needless to say it was very disappointing. I ordered the spicy chk deluxe combo and she ordered the original chk combo. Our sandwiches were pretty bland and mushy, I didn't even taste any kick at all with my spicy chk. The fries and the Chik fil A sauce are the only reason I gave them 2 stars. The employees were nice enough, but I really don't like feeling like I'm listening to a sermon while I'm trying to eat. One of the employees was pretty loud when talking (preaching)to another table about \"our lord and savior Jesus Christ\"...Does this company realize where they opened? This is SIN CITY, ha ha ha...but to each their own. I understand and respect other peoples beliefs, but apparently the owners of this company really really want you to know where they stand. If the food had been good I would deal with it and keep coming back, but it wasn't anything special. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, if I was starving and their was nothing else available....maybe."}
{"text":"One of the better ones I have been to. I would say, for myself, that this one is the premiere Chick-Fil-A for Charlotte, NC. Parking can be an issue and according to what time of day you go there may and could be a very large crowd. So plan accordingly. Food has always been hot, fresh, and good."}
{"text":"The friendliest chick-fil-a ive ever been to! It seems super busy during lunch rush but the service is super fast in the dining room and the drive thru!"}
{"text":"This is the only \"fast food\" place that I will eat at and for very good reasons! The chicken is great and the staff is definitely held to a higher standard. I enjoy seeing young people taught to treat customers with respect and to also have respect for themselves. I appreciate the values and standards of this business and it is in part why I purchase food from here. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We come here a lot as my kids love their chicken and as a mom, the grilled chicken option seems better than a burger when it comes to fast food. I also order the grilled chicken which is so good. I also love their lemonade! Very fresh and very family oriented environment. They also have little events every once in a whine. Like they had a father daughter princess day, with the characters from frozen and they took the parents and kids fur a ride in a limo. It was so cute! They have other events to every so often. They said to check online to see when they are coming up! Overall live this place!"}
{"text":"Had to find that \"fast food\" meal and this was a perfect choice for this Cali fam to try.  My kids said this is \"real\" chicken sandwiches. Of course they eat at Mc D's alot. Not only that, the manager came by and checked on us and re ~filled or drinks personally.  Now thats service for a fast food place. We were out in 30 minutes and happy to leave Arizona satisfied in or tummies.  Can't wait til Chick Fil a comes to Norcal!"}
{"text":"Probably the best chick fil a location near South Charlotte. Never too crowded, not rude employees & its just in a good location. I don't like very crowded restaurants & the food at this chick fil a is very excellent"}
{"text":"Time for an update, as I've been going here a few times a month ever since they opened. Service speed inside the restaurant has improved somewhat, and the management seems to be more attentive about covering off on drink refills for customers lurking at the counter.

Fact of the matter is - if you've been to a Chick-fil-A, you've been to this Chick-fil-A. They're all consistent and this one is no longer an exception with their improvements to service. I do appreciate that they don't play religious music in the restaurant, though, which is something I find annoying at a few other local Chick-fil-A's. I'm a heathen and I'm there for my guilty chicken fix, don't try to convert me. 

One start docked for a simple reason: The booths are starting to get worn and overall the restaurant is beginning to show its age. Everything doesn't need to be sparkling new, but if someone has slashed the vinyl in one of the booth seats, get it fixed, yaknow? The profit margins should cover general maintenance."}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A store forgot to put a 12-count nugget in my drive thru order. A simple enough mistake - it was crowded that day. I called upon realizing their mistake and the manager who took my call assured me they would send me a coupon for the 12 count nugget in addition to other coupons. I made sure to clarify multiple times that I would be getting at least this much, because I would rather have an immediate refund rather than coupons to be mailed.

Over two weeks later I finally received a hand written note from Chick-fil-A and a coupon for less than the value of a 12 piece nugget.

I love Chick-fil-A's food, but I will never return to this store. This location is almost always crowded and probably won't miss my business, but I hope for their sake they become more conscious of how they treat customers so as to not lose anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Friendly and fast! Alex our cashier was great!! Restaurant was clean and comfortable!"}
{"text":"Can't stand this place unless Kellen, the 6'5 Hunk, is working. All customer service by Kellen is more than exceptional. He not only deals with my sassiness but is also good with his hand (no pun intended) The guy can make anyone laugh, I almost hooked him up with a gig at the comedy club I own but he's moving up at chick fil a so he didn't want to jeopardize anything. Tells you the kind of guy he is, super loyal!"}
{"text":"I'm normally impressed with Chick Fila Service,however not this this one ..The cashier Thomas is what's listed on my receipt but it's a lady so I'm not sure if that's her last name or what but she saw nothing wrong with dropping something on the floor and placing it back in the bag on top of my baby fries..Just nasty ...smh"}
{"text":"Had lunch 
The spicy chicken sandwich with extra pickle
Pretty good service food was good as well
The restaurant was clean and very friendly"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! Love eating here don't feel as guilty even though it is fast food lol"}
{"text":"Really excited to have the first ever Chick Fil A come to Vegas.  Apparently they opened two locations in one day (today) but I visited the one on Eastern & St. Rose Pkwy.  We got there around 11am and there was a long line of cars- which we expected knowing they opened early today- I think maybe around 6:30 am.    We met the owner- or owners wife- Dana.  She was very friendly and the staff was really on the ball.   I had the chick-fil-A sandwich with no pickle. (all sandwiches always come with a pickle but you can special order it without it).  I also had waffle fries and a lemonade.  I took a kids meal home which consists of chicken nuggets, small fry and a small drink plus a kids toy.   Even though they were crazy busy...the food was just as expected \"hot and fresh\".  The service was really 5 star (this is fast food but they were all really helpful and smiling).  There is a play area for kids inside.  Outside is a sitting deck for nice days to enjoy the meal and get some fresh air.  There was two lanes for the drive thru.  Today is an exceptionally busy day due to the grand opening and I'm guessing they had around 30 cars in the drive thru.  

Complete meals (chicken, fries and drink) are around $7.99 and kids meals are $3.85

We were really happy to meet the cow today (costume person dressed as the iconic cow in their marketing ads)!  What a cutie.  Too bad he's not there all the time to hang out with customers.   It's a special treat."}
{"text":"The best chicken anywhere.  And their chick filet sauce is good.   But the most impressive part is the staff.  Do you know how nice it is to have a counter person respond with \"My pleasure\" instead of the usual \"No problem\"?  These people are well trained to satisfy their customer base and go above and beyond.   
I do wish that the local franchise hadn't dropped their carrot raisin side salad.  It was my favorite and I do miss it."}
{"text":"I don't mind the 30 minute wait for lunch rush because I enjoy their food, however, today I waited, got the wrong order and gave it back only to get the wrong order again...I certainly wasn't going to wait a third time. Sorry cows, only 1 star today."}
{"text":"An east coast chicken chain that is simply awesome at what they do. The staff was very friendly employees assigned to the dining area made sure the area was clean and asked if they could assist on refilling drinks. The food was delivered in a timely manor and the employees I interacted with went above and beyond."}
{"text":"The place has been opened for about a month now and after several failed attempts to enjoy my favorite fast food I was finally able to enter and enjoy a meal. Their food is simple but delicious. Who would have thought a chicken breast a pickle and a bun could taste so good. That along with waffle fries and a frozen lemonade equals a well balanced meal. The place was busy and had plenty of staff to accommodate its patrons. The manager made rounds to ensure guests were satisfied with their meals and service. He even stepped up and got a guy at the next table a refill for his drink. Way above the service you get at competing fast food joints.  For those of you who have kids they also offer a play area so you can enjoy your meal in peace."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Just don't try to come on Sunday."}
{"text":"By far the worst Chick-fil-a I've ever been to. We went through the drive thru today and once again our order was messed up. It was $10 worth of food and shouldn't have been that difficult to get right. This was the second time in a month our order has been wrong.  They are even worse than McDonalds.  They may need to consider given their employees literacy tests before hiring them."}
{"text":"I'm not a chicken fan, but I love the chicken here. Lightning quick service with a smile. Only complaint...not open Sunday :("}
{"text":"How are you going to have a grand opening and not have the full menu? It's like going to an ALL YOU CAN EAT Buffet and all they have is salad. I am livid. Worst Grand Opening Ever. I love Chick-Fil-A but this location dropped the ball. You had months and months to plan and train employees. Saying \"We're getting used to the breakfast menu\" is no excuse."}
{"text":"A month old and still a huge line, staff still seems overwhelmed and inexperienced. My order is correct about 50% of the time. I will still go as it is the closest location to my home, but I prefer the Paradise Valley location, which is cleaner, has better staff, and I've never had a problem with my order being wrong, either. Drive thru logistics are mind boggling, but can't really be blamed on the franchise. Hopefully the experience will improve over time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff And a clean dining area are two things I noticed immediately.  As always the food is superb and does not leave you feeling like there is a brick in your stomach as most fast food places do. Kids play area was clean as well."}
{"text":"Best fast food place I've eaten.  Perfect if you have children.  Nice play area.  Food good and timely, service excellent.  Would eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is awful - the get orders messed up and lose track of customers.  I ordered a sandwich and 10 minutes later am still waiting and then they tell me the kitchen cancelled it - amateur high school
kids who are clueless"}
{"text":"Stopped for a late breakfast. Dominic chatted with me while he was cleaning the dining area. He was incredibly friendly, funny and happy. The cashier - I didn't catch her name - but she welcomed me the moment I walked in the door, but she immediately let me know she was ready to help me when I was ready to order, and didn't wander off like people are prone to do even though I wasn't ready - so when I had questions she was there to answer my questions, which I found helpful. She was thorough in asking questions like did I want sauces, which size, meal or just an item, etc. She asked my name, which maybe customary but I have a unique name, and I left without taking my drink. She remembered my name and called me back to get my drink as I was walking away. My food was brought quickly - I didn't have to wait more than maybe a minute for it. Overall, a pleasant breakfast experience."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I had a chance to experience a chick fil.a .I am very disappointed. The meal did taste good however I had to go back for my drink , and when I got it back to my hotel room I found that I did not get the amount of strips I ordered, and they were a   ridiculous size. They must have come from very tiny chickens.i am very disappointed. I think that I will stick to canes in my home town!"}
{"text":"Love the food but this location is so freaked slow for some reason. Always n line for ever and no one seems to know what they are doing ."}
{"text":"The worst customer service.   Very unorganized at the cash register.   Waited over 15 minutes for food.  The employees socialize with customers rather than provide service.  Never coming here again when I can drive up the road and be served the correct way."}
{"text":"Reason why I'm not giving this place 1 star is because they always get my order right and their drive thru is pretty fast. Reason why I'm giving it only 2 stars because I would ask them the amount of sauces I want & they would only give me one of each of what I ask for.....  so my boyfriend went inside and told them that they didn't give us the right amount and an employee specifically said, \"I'm sorry about that, they never give the right amount\".... what a shame. 

Cm'on y'all, I'm so tired of coming out of the drive thru and having to walk into the store and ask for the amount of sauces I originally ASKED for. And at the window, we specifically told them to not forget to give us the right amount of sauces and lady at the window said she got it all. But nope.... checked the bag and still.... I also checked the receipt to make sure they got it down at the speaker box. Lady got down the wrong amount and STILL gave us one of each. 

I would love to go to a different chick-fil-a, but this one is the closest to our place. And I absolutely love chick-fil-a, so it's so hard to not go lol. Especially this place specifically."}
{"text":"I love this location and the service is good. The only problem I have is my fries being super over salted. All the fries should be unsalted period. Other than that I have no other problems."}
{"text":"This chikfila is not the best. The one on Power and the 202 is better. Customer service is terrible, the chicken is on a diet at this location, but what finally made me say no to this particular location is the chicken noodle soup that contained no chicken. Pictures to follow"}
{"text":"By far the best Chick-Fil-A in Charlotte - service is always great as well as the food.  Always a frequent visitor - a very convenient location - worth being patient for when crowded!"}
{"text":"This  place has a great employee . Everyone is so friendly and clean. They are always clean , working,&  smiling . It a great place to take your family it way better than taking them to Burger King or any fast food place . Our food was good and the sweet tea ."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my daughters on my way to work and ordered 3 meals drive thru, I only ordered one of the breakfast sandwiches special order and it took them three tries to get it right. SMH. The manager did bring the food curbside and gave me two gift card for a free breakfast treat and small frosted sunrise. The food is great but servers need training on taking proper orders"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Always clean. Always exceptional customer service. We have never had bad experience and come here often! And of course food is always fresh and good!"}
{"text":"I have to say that besides the deliciousness of their chicken, their customer service is the reason I keep coming back. I love the fact that when I take my children there, I can place my order and sit down, and they will bring it out to me. They also have someone walking around re-filling drinks, which is again a plus when you have a little one in a high chair.  There is also someone always walking around cleaning, which again is a plus. There is nothing worse then sitting down to a table with sticky spots. The play ground is always clean, I just wish parents would keep a better eye on their children while they are in there. Since it is all enclosed parents send their kids in there and pay no attention.  Other than lazy parents, I do not have anything bad to say about this location."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Great food. Chicken was moist as always, frys were crunchy just how I like them! Will be back again"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Cleanest, friendliest, and most welcoming fast food location I have ever been too.  Flowers on the table are a unique touch.  The staff walking around asking how your meal is and if they can get anything for you is really nice too.  Not a huge fan of the french fries... but other than that I'd say this Chick-Fil-A sets the bar for fast food in my head."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't take time to write a Yelp review about a fast food place but I need to give this one some props. Great food of course, but also extremely courteous staff and great service. Always blown away when I go here. It feels like I'm in a different dimension with how polite the staff is. They actually seem like they enjoy their work. I hope they are getting paid well! They deserve it! A+"}
{"text":"Wow! Thank you Chik-fil-a for coming to Las Vegas. If you haven't had Chik Fil a yet you are seriously missing out.  This is by far the best chicken burger place anywhere. The best part of this establishment is that you have a full meal and don't have that greasy i wish didn't do that feeling after. Been here multiple times in the last few weeks. Staff is awesome and food is great.  Also, even though it hurts thank you for staying true and closing on Sundays. The Nuggets are to die for!"}
{"text":"My dad, my husband and I just ate their for lunch today. Everyone was so nice and helpful and actually looked happy to be there. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, always polite and I love the food.  Very fast and sufficient."}
{"text":"Man best service ever!!!!!!!!!! They are quick on their feet , very clean and just awesome attitudes . If you eat in they check on you as if you were in a restaurant !"}
{"text":"The salads are the best!!  The restaurant is clean and the environment is welcoming.  The workers was very nice and they always serve a smile while being very professional and courteous!!  My puppy loves the doggie treats they give out!  This restaurant has good food, good customer service, but can be pricey!  Good job Chick-fil-A you deserve a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I've been coming to this location for the past two years. I work close by so I usually come here for lunch. I love that the service is fast; I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes (even during the holiday season) which is convenient! Your employees are warm and friendly and the managers have always been polite. And of course the food is always good, especially their salads. Overall,it's a good place to eat and you can tell they really care about their customers. :)"}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service of any Chik-fil-A I have been to. We pull into the drive thru at 10:24am to get served by the walking agent at 10:31am for him to tell us sorry breakfast closed at 10:30am. Are you serious you saw me sitting here in line prior to the 10:30am cut off. Than has the audacity to say let me see what's left over like giving us scraps is customer service. But had we been served at 10:29am they would've made us our entire meal. The managers Diane and Denise on top of that have no care or sense of customer service to take the time and just make the meal. I will not be coming to this location again. Very poor customer service. Business here must be that phenomenal that you turn away business."}
{"text":"I have been to many Chick Fil As in Tucson and this Phoenix location has the best service I've ever seen. Me and my school group (about 20 people), came in and we ordered and got our food within 10 minutes. The workers we really nice and very efficient and productive. The food was good for fast food. I also recommend the frosted lemonade!!"}
{"text":"The food is great! The service is horrible. The girl walked up to my car window and ask me what I would like to order, I asked if I could have a menu and she replied very rudely \"oh you never had food here before??\" I told her I've had it many times as I'm from Florida where there's as many Chick-Fil-A's as McDonald's but that still doesn't mean I can't see a menu before ordering. It hasn't even been open a week and the workers hate their jobs."}
{"text":"I am a huge Chik-fil-a fan and this location is not up to par. I have gone twice now and the service was terrible. The first time I went our order was missing items the second time the salad I got was old and the chicken was chewy. I will stick with the location on Chandler Blvd.  Always friendly, fast and fresh food. I hope they can get it together. I won't be going back. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"My go to place for an amazing chicken sandwich. I order the spicy chicken sandwich meal with diet lemonade and I enjoy every bite. I use chick fil a sauce and dip my fires and sandwich in it as its the best. I love chick fil a and will always continue to eat here."}
{"text":"They are slow like a lot of reviews have stated. I stood a long time waiting for my order and I could see there are a lot of employees behind the counter, but the orders weren't coming out. But unlike other fast food restaurants, here at Chik-Fil-A your food will be hot and fresh and it was. Just too bad if I were in a hurry I would have to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's chic-fil-a! How often do they go wrong? Great service and hot food. Had the chicken strips my new favorites. Too bad I couldn't eat in for my second helping of tea."}
{"text":"I was having a rough day so my go to for comfort food is Chick-fil-A. The food was delicious as usual but what made it a great experience was your employee Nick. He was very polite and courteous. He engaged us in enjoyable conversation and really turned my night around. He is a great addition to your staff. I was told he has been there a little over a month but he seems to be really excelling in the customer service area! This is my first yelp review but I wanted to make it positive for a special person that made us feel special! Great job Nick , keep up the good work! We will be back to enjoy the delicious milkshakes and kind staff!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food places goes, this place is FAST. They do breakfast and lunch really well and know that there target market is working in one of the many buildings around and wants a quick grab and go lunch.

I walked down here today to grab a salad and I think I was in and out in like 3 minutes! The only downside to this location is they don't carry the Asian Salad. I know, I know, getting a salad at a fast food place is like denying my inner fatty but this salad is absolutely amazing and has fried chicken on top! No clue why this place doesnt serve it and the SessemeDresing to go with it :("}
{"text":"This place sets the standard for fast food chicken.  I have been here several times and each time the place is extremely clean and the staff is super friendly.  They always welcome you as soon as you walk into the door and go above and beyond in the customer service department.  The food is made quickly and always tastes fresh, unlike other places.  I know it's just a chicken sandwich, but the quality is above and beyond other places.  The last time I went I had a spicy chicken sandwich.  It had a good amount of spice and was tender and juicy.  I understand why people follow this place as if it has a cult status. 

Hopefully this will the first of many future Chick Fil A's in the valley.  The only negative thing is that there is usually a huge line in the afternoons.  It moves quickly, but hopefully the \"newness\" will wear off shortly and it will be a regular place to eat soon."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A. Their food is good, but their customer service and staff are incredible. With their help we pulled off an amazing fundraiser for my daughter's teacher who is fighting cancer. We had a busy night and they kept everything running perfectly. Thank you Robert, Stephanie, and the rest of your staff!"}
{"text":"The best Chick Fill A I ever been to. And we been all over the world and ate at Chick Fill A..Very friendly staff. Restaurant is spotless..you wont be disapointed, unless you're a chicken. :)"}
{"text":"Customer Service is great. I always feel welcomed. Food is always prepared hot and ready."}
{"text":"For a place so new, they really had the efficiency nailed down and the line moved quickly. The food was served to our table hot & fresh and was very prompt. The employees were all top notch friendly and I can't wait to go back. I simply love their chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"I honestly love Chic-fil-A!! This is one of my favorite locations, because it's super clean and the employees are always friendly and fast with the service. Yesterday I had a what should have been an embarrassing moment and the cashier helping Domonique provided me with my meal on the house! I was completely shocked and very appreciative. I hope someone who works there reads this review and lets him know how great he is:)"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and the food is always good.  Our order wasn't right when we had already gotten home a couple of years ago and the manager sent us a $20 gift card as a sorry. They will have our business for life!"}
{"text":"Great service & excellent food! I love the app & the curbside service as well as earning free treats on the app. Also greatly respect their decision to be closed on Sundays. Wish more restaurants & shops did that."}
{"text":"Very good

Enjoyable. Better quality than fast food. Reasonably priced. 
Chick fil a sauce was so tasty
Lemonade was excellent."}
{"text":"It has some good food. During my pregnancy I ate here too frequently and I lost the desire to come here again. The food is pricier, though it is supposed to be healthier for you. I would visit In N Out burger in lieu of here. Also my sister had applied to work here but they would not give her the time of day to listen or even accept her application, which shows the staff of this location are not considerate to others."}
{"text":"Amazing food for fast food, very friendly, great for family. Here are my pros and cons.

Pros
+ Great food, everything I have got here has been above part
+ People there remember my name, may have something to do worn me being there every week
+ For families, they have events and a play area. They are a true family place
+ Good food for the money

Cons
- With Chris who works there, I'm not sure if he Hayes me or really really loves me

All in all,  a great place to go."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Busy but employees were efficient. Happy they are in the neighbor."}
{"text":"Love  it's the bomb.com never disappoints either go to sandwich or the chicken fingers happy all the time"}
{"text":"Used mobile app to order line had 13 ppl in it.  All 13 orders were placed and a few more taken and the 13 in line recieved their food before I did. Poor service. I frequent various chick-fil-a restaurants in various states this one is by far the worst for service timing. It does have an indoor playground tho."}
{"text":"I love and respect the ownership and closing on Sunday for religious reasons. Good for you guys."}
{"text":"Every single time we have an issue especially in the drive thru.... they rush you when taking your order, cram all of your food in 1 bag, make your order incorrectly or forget parts of your order before pushing you through to get to the next person.I have tried to give them the benefit and go back but its a reoccurring issue.

Last time I stopped and checked the order and with no surprise we were missing a sandwich - I went back in and spoke to a manager who was unapologetic and rude demanding a receipt when I had just pulled off the drive through, I explained this is a reoccurring issue and he directed me to the wall to get information if I would like to let the operator know.

The management needs to get it together - Don't waste your time go to somewhere that cares about your business. Plenty of other options in that area."}
{"text":"Service was super fast. Crowds have
died down. I was the first one in line & when I got up to the window, my food was ready. I've had Chick-Fil-A in Cali. before, so it wasn't a big deal for me. I just wanted to try it again since it's been several years. I still don't get what all the fuss was about with people camping outside, etc. when it was opened. The chicken strips are OK, but I've had better. I don't care for their dry, bland waffle fries. The service was good & friendly, but it's not a place I would frequent."}
{"text":"Most assuredly the worst Chick-fil-A I have ever seen.  This place was a disaster!  It was dirty, slow service, and it appeared the staff was there to visit with all their friends hanging out at the place.  Tough parking and tough clientele. Bad experience."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Chic-Fil-A I've ever been. I've been there 10-15 times since moving to the area and they have screwed up something in the order 8-10 of those times. No joke. From giving fried chicken instead of grilled on a salad to not putting fries in the bag to forgetting to give you straws and napkins. They constantly screw spending up which is very odd if you've ever been to this chain.... Usually the service is perfect. Not here. 

To top it off, the last time they screwed it up I called to talk to the \"manager\" on duty and though she offered to make it right if I came back (was already driving home with a take out order) or to mail me something she did everything in her power to not put me in contact with the store manager. I think I know why the service is bad.... The on-duty managers probably never tell the store manager when they constantly make mistakes or I would expect it to be corrected which would be standard for this usually excellent chain. 

Food is typical quality for CFA here which is the only reason it didn't get 1 star."}
{"text":"MAJOR FAIL!!
You'd think a Chick-fil-a was perfect, but Friday at lunch we stood in line for 10+ minutes when without a warning or word the order taker at our line of 15-20 people just turned around and went in the back.  No comment from any employee.... after waiting about 3-5 minutes the customer in front of the EMPTY register asked the server next to it and we were told to move to another line!!???!!.... THIS WAS 12+ MINUTES INTO OUR WAIT!!  We went elsewhere since it didn't matter to C-F-A how inconvenienced their customers were.  We wont be back to this location.  Zero customer consideration."}
{"text":"Quickest drive thru ever!!!! Staff is always so nice. Try their frosted coffee. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Today we had the chicken strips with Fil-A sauce great stuff and pretty good service next time I have to try the nuggets they look pretty good"}
{"text":"Went here last April 22 (Saturday) and expected that there will be very long line at their drive thru since it's lunch time. Good thing there were only 4 cars infront of me. I ordered 2 spicy chicken deluxe combo and a kids meal. I told the order taker 3x that I want apple juice for my daughters kids meal. I asked him if I can get 3 Chick-fil-a sauce & 3 Polynesian Sauce and he said it's fine.

When we went home, my daughter took a sip on her cup and said it was soda(root beer). I opened the take out bag then found only 1 chick-fil- a sauce & 2 Polynesian sauce. Quite disappointed. Food was good but their service...they still need some improvement."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time and usually get good service. This morning however I received stellar service! Robert  and the manager on duty were awesome. She made floral arrangements while interacting with customers and kept A smile on her face. Robert was very helpful, cheerful, and energetic creating a wonderful ordering experience this Morning."}
{"text":"They forgot all my sauce for the second time in a row. I'm starting to think they ask just to check it off a list. Do they even have sauce? Guess I'll buy my nuggets elsewhere."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I've ordered food for me and my coworkers from the drive-thru a few times. The first time our orders were wrong then the next time the orders were wrong again. The third time I returned to the location and the manager gave me a hard time because they had given me too much food and overcharged me. I brought the extra items to get a refund and she was plain rude to me. Needles to say, I will not be returning to this location...three strikes, your out!"}
{"text":"Wow, I have never had such great service as I received  from the staff at this Chick-fil-a. Everyone was friendly and happy and the food was great. My food was fresh hot and delicious. Congratulations to the management of this location. Well done.

I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is the one place where I'd come and just order the chicken, no sides, don't care about drinks. Just take my money and give me your delicious chicken! 

Seriously, their chicken are stand outs. We ordered  the spicy chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets, chicken strips, lemonade, and waffle fries. 

The chicken is deliciously seasoned and fried to perfection. 

The sauces:

Polynesian (what a totally random name for a sauce, not sure why it's given this name - maybe because it's like a paradise in your mouth?): think sweet and sour sauce from a Chinese take-out place. 

Chick-fil-a: a BBQ-y honey mustard

Pete's hot sauce: omggood! Best mixed with the Polynesian sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, order is always accurate, they're fast, and it's always very clean. I love chick fil a !"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a's seem to be consistent no matter which one you go to. Their drive thrus (while most of the time have long lines) move fairly quick, the food is yummy (can't go wrong with their sandwiches or nuggets), and the employees are always pleasant! Don't forget to download their app, if I recall correctly you can earn free food that way."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Staff so friendly and helpful. Ordered chiken strips for the kids and since they took to long, they gave us extra fries and dessert for free. Manager is a great.Clean and neat always keep going back."}
{"text":"This time I went by the drive thru and always AAA in customer service. Trinity, took our order in such a pleasant way you feel welcomed to go again and again.Only bad thing, It was nighttime and the menu boards at the drive thru had no lights and it was difficult to read the menu and the whole place in the back is dark. They need lighting in the drive thru for security. Food is always great."}
{"text":"This fast  food chain always goes the extra mile to offer it's  customers a AAA service. Employees always with a smile, so helpful, looking happy to work at this place. It was wonderful as always. Employees were friendlier than other Chick Filets."}
{"text":"Your typical everyday chick-fil-a except this one is in Monroeville. The staff is friendly. Food is always good, the milkshakes are amazing. If you have kids, they have an indoor playground and a bowl of peppermints near the exit."}
{"text":"Their chicken minis are always so fresh and delicious. There is one person that works the drive thru who doesn't seem as pleasant. She was working this morning and seems like she doesn't want to be at work or doesn't want to serve the public.  Other than this, pleased as usual."}
{"text":"Awesome service! The manager, Rafael,  was walking around checking on tables and made sure everyone was happy.  My food was delayed a bit and he took care of me and gave me a free meal for my next visit there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It doesn't even seem like a fast food place because of the outstanding customer service, and clean/modern interior. The food is also the BEST!"}
{"text":"All chick-fil-as are wonderful with amazing food where the price is worth it and fast service. However with this chick-fil-a the service is even better than usual. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this Chic-fil-A.  It's busy, but rarely ever a crazy zoo. The building is larger than most, which makes it feel way less crowded. Even at lunch, the crowd is pretty much adults lunching vs. hoards of screaming children. Staff is so, so friendly. I'm thinking of asking Mary, the floor attendant to adopt me as her granddaughter:)"}
{"text":"The day team here is great. They deserve more than one star for sure, but the crew at night?  Negative five stars. 

First off, it's always so insanely busy here in the evening. Drive thru line wrapped around the building and often no spots in the lot. Tonight, the inside line was wrapped three lines deep through their little rope maze almost our entire visit. It was just painfully slow. And it was a school Spirit Night.  

There were never more than two registers open and for much of the time I could only see one steadily open. That young man should be commended because he was working very hard. The rest of the teenagers were: taking breaks (7 kids at one time while the line is 3 deep!!), walking around trying to look busy, talking to and distracting the kids trying to actually work or generally keeping busy doing things that didn't seem to actually help the line flow. I'm not kidding that I didn't see a single  adult supervisor present to provide leadership. I wish I could say this is the first time I observed this at this chic-fil-a, but it seems like this is the norm for the night crew. I mean maybe having 7 workers on break at 6:45 during dinner rush is a poor idea???

Also, while it's generous of Chic-fil-A to run spirit nights, I think this location should cease offering them because they never staff appropriately and it's just a painful experience for the customers. Or maybe they could just schedule an adult front end manager to work that night. 

The next time my kids ask to come here for dinner I'm going to do something more fun - like go for a root canal, slam my finger in my car door or maybe step in a fire ant hill."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. You can get fast food, without being treated like you're eating at a fast food restaurant. 
There are live, growing flowers on every table, free wi-fi, impeccably kept restrooms and dining area, little cups of cheerios to keep small fry entertained while waiting for meals, the list goes on and on.
Every Wednesday is family night, with a different entertainer like a baloon artist (who won't accept tips), a magician, and others.
They help out local schools with fundraising nights and accept any coupon, expired or not.
These are just a few of the reasons that this place deserves five stars.

Amazing

(they also do online ordering. How cool is that?)"}
{"text":"I had never really been to Chick-Fil-A before and I admire their Christian stance. I don't have a car so the other restaurants were kinda too far for me to get to. I was thrilled when I learned one was opening up on Camelback and 16th street. I went to the opening day and had the charboiled chicken sandwich, waffle fries and a drink. Food was great. I was simply amazed at the service provided. It does not have the fast food feel to it. Numerous employees stopped by to see if I needed a refill on my drink or if I needed anything else. They brought my food to me. All employees were courteous. Right before i left, I decided I needed a milkshake. So I ordered a cookies and cream and it was amazing. 

Thankful I have a restaurant to go to that stands up for what's right and is pro traditional marriage. :)"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A and they really do a great job getting you through the line.  but I'm finding a problem with this location. Missing food items and no forks for the salad no nuts for the salad forgot my Salad.  Today when stopping for a large superfood salad and some chicken nuggets my nuggets were kind of sad looking and my superfood salad was definitely not a large.... package was only filled about halfway luckily I got the nuts.  So me having to check my food before I leave just slows the line down."}
{"text":"Protein style spicy deluxe isn't exactly low carb. It is dellish though. Talk about fast drive through service. They have their system down."}
{"text":"Excellent service! All the employees were extremely professional and well mannered. I've never been here before, but they were the nicest fast food place I have even been. I will definitely be returning strictly for the service!"}
{"text":"Love Chick-fil-A. Came in to use my $100 gift card I got for Christmas. Unfortunately, their gift card system was down. The cashier (according to the receipt), Kaylene, said he would take care of me and charged my two entrees for $0.00 so I got my whole meal for free  Greatly appreciate the customer service. Food was delivered promptly and the seating area looked well maintained."}
{"text":"We finally made our way out to the location on Eastern.   We chose to order inside, as the drive thru line was RIDICULOUSLY long!  We ordered and recieved our  food to go in about 15 min.  I was impressed with that given how many people were there. 

I ordered the basic chicken sandwich, and my wife got the spicy chicken sandwich.   Although the chicken itself was tasty, and fresh, i really feel the same quality can be found at other chicken places.  (Without the mayhem of a thousand other customers)

However... the waffle fries were BORING, and BLAND.  They were similar to the fries you would get in the freezer section of your local market.  May i suggest adding some type of flavor enhancer.  Seasoned salt or something.  

No disrespect but,  we have no plans to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So my husband bought me the spicy chicken meal and the nuggets, I specifically ordered the sweet tea. When he came home my drink was full of just ice and the sweet tea is approximately like 4 sips and no more. They trick their customers who pays so much money to eat and in return they fill your cup with 90% ice and 10% drink. Their nuggets is overcooked and the spicy chicken deluxe is saggy with its pickles. My husband paid almost 20$ for my meal. I don't mind paying so much money for food but the food and drink must be the quality and appropriate amount. Don't go here or any of their restaurants it's NOT WORTH of what you pay for. Spend your money to a really nice fast food or restaurant that will give you what you pay for. It's a waste of money here. I would give it a Zero if I have the option! Look at my picture of all the ice they have in my cup. I promise you it's not from my fridge because the ice make is just from restaurants. So don't question it! I never complain if there's nothing to complain about. I also give compliments to those who exceeds my expectations!"}
{"text":"Went here twice already since they opened, their chicken sandwich and Potato wedges are good. Not too salty. Their original sauce is good too, grilled chicken sandwich is not good. Over priced though I mean their portions are not that big. Like the soup is like too small, their chicken club salad is so small, potato wedges are like maybe 13 pcs  and be aware that they put too much ice on ur drink like I looked at the cup and half of the large drink was just ice. Wth! Their cookies are good. Nuggets burned all the time and portion is small like you won't get filled up for a 36$ fast food. Which consists of 2 simple chicken sandwich, 2 potato  wedges, 2 cookies, 1 soup, and the salad cup and one large drink. So yeah! It's expensive and the long wait is still annoying after so many weeks they have been opened at least no more cops which is unnecessary... 3 stars only. So if u don't want to spend too much don't go here, is u want big portions don't go here, if u have no patience don't go here. And if u want ur drink appropriate with what u paid for don't go here!"}
{"text":"Love this place :) so busy always but worth it. All employees are friendly. Good fast service!"}
{"text":"Really like their food, any Chick Fil A is usually great food and great service. 4 stars because this location is SO busy for lunch. Recently found out their mobile app can save you tons of time. The lines do move fast, but don't like the anxiety of all the traffic during lunch rush. They have new menu item, chicken sliders, good and crispy, but expensive and small portion."}
{"text":"I come here during my lunch break for work. It's like any other Chic-Fil-A I've been to. Good food & great service. The only downfall is how busy it is during lunchtime, but all the restaurants in the area are PACKED during lunch, so it's inescapable. I'm not gonna stop going here anytime soon. Mostly because I love waffle fries. And the cool ketchup packets you get only at Chic-Fil-A."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful. Chicken egg and cheese bagel was awesome! The owner Dave appreciated our business and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decent pricing, food was very good.  Spicy chicken had a nice bite without being screaming hot"}
{"text":"Very good Chicken and don't forget to get the honey gold sauce to dip your chicken sandwich or just chick n strips in.......  I like to call this stuff LIQUID GOLD.
They also serve breakfast as well.  The restaurant is always clean.  I have even been in there when they have LIVE ENTERTAINMENT.  Usually a two person small band singing songs.  Very well run and great for the family."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest chick Fil a I have ever been in. The store manager spent more time teasing her employees than serving needs of the restaurant. The men's room was filthy with no hand towels. The waffle fries were cold and it took about 20 mins to get food. Given that the minimum wage is $10 per hour you would think that they could do a better job. Typically this location is good but I will think twice about coming here and so should you."}
{"text":"The staff was more interested in talking with friend rather than serving the customers. Food was cold and service is horrible even for mall food. Go somewhere else. The wait for food was 15 mins or more. They got my order wrong twice to top it all off"}
{"text":"Went in and like I expected a great friendly welcoming vibe that I don't really get anywhere lol the men and women that go out to the lounge area to accommodate guest are the real rockstars!! To remember someone by name is very meaningful in my world ! Also asking me if my meal was good is another kind and simple gesture that makes a guest feel good !!"}
{"text":"Fast & friendly service and fast food as good as you can come by. I wouldn't expect anything less of Chick-Fil-A!!"}
{"text":"I was raised in the south and have been eating Chick-Fil-A since before I could talk. My favorite fast food place without a doubt!!!!

Food quality is good, employees always seem to love their job and if you eat inside you get table side service! What's not to love?

I have never had anything that wasn't good a CFA and they have some of the best milkshakes EVER!!! I highly recommend their summer special Banana Pudding filled with little bites of Nilla Wafers!

Super friendly location that is kept clean and food is always fresh and the play area will keep my almost 2 year old and 8 1/2 year old content!! 

For fast food, it is truly \"As good as it gets!\" for fast food. There you go Chick-Fil-A, you can have my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love be this place. I am so happy that it finally moved to the Las Vegas valley. I have yet to be to this location but I know from my experiences I had in Southern California it's amazing food. The sauces are awesome and your can't go wrong with the waffle fries. I mean come on they are amazing. Seriously try the food it's delicious."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to say but I went in this CFA yesterday to wait for someone to land at the Mesa airport. I ordered a couple of items and waited to retrieve my drink at the counter. When the young lady brought it to me I said thank you and she said uh-huh. I thought it strange since I've always been told \"my pleasure\" with a smile. Then the young man who was replacing the ketchup wouldn't budge for me to get a straw and napkin or even a ketchup packet. He then brought my food to the table and when I said thank you - he GRUNTED!!! I have to say - I didn't feel the chickfila love yesterday. I was surprised that the shift leader was also not friendly and didn't seem to be interested in what was going on either. Needless to say - I hope these unhappy employees will move on and let someone have their jobs who would be happy to have a job."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their chicken sandwich. This is the only chicken sandwich that is not dry in my opinion. Food is always fresh and hot and hits the spot every time. The staff is always polite and attentive. One of the best fast food restaurants around. I'm just sad that I only discovered them about 10 years ago.  A+++"}
{"text":"Listen, I love Chick but this one sucked!  Went for breakfast and had to wait because they ran out of coffee. Really????  It's coffee and it's breakfast. How could you let that happen. Add into that the quality of the breakfast burrito was substandard and you'll understand my rating. I still love you Chick but not this location. I'd recommend some re-training for the breakfast crew!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience at this chick-fil-a! Wow. My boyfriend and I were coming back from a shotgun range out north to celebrate the fact that he finished his first semester of grad school. Upon ordering a huge milkshake and fries (which we never do), Becca bought us the milkshake! We thought she was just kidding but then it was actually free! What a kind person. Chick-fil-a should be extremely proud of an employee who really goes the extra mile to make their customers day. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Let me start off that when I went here, it was PACKED. Tons of people were inside that day, but that didn't hurt my experience much at all. The service was pretty fast and actually pretty nice for a restaurant that full. I ordered some chicken nuggets with fries and a soda, and it was tasty. I wish that I could go get a refill myself instead of waiting in a long line. But, their employees are always helping around the restaurant, so you just need to ask one of them. Also, I like the little ketchup packets :) Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good place to eat, but it can be packed. On the day we went there, the parking lot was full and we had to park at Longhorn Steakhouse and walk across the street."}
{"text":"Here is my gripe. The food is good. No complaints there. It's the employees. While standing at the register and ordering, there were three girls behind the counter that kept staring at my wife, whispering, and rolling their eyes. They were literally looking her up and down. I had sunglasses on so they could not see that I was watching them, and actually my wife didn't notice it because she was busy ordering for our kids. After we went and sat down, I continued to watch them, and from a distance I not only observed the girls gawking at various femaie customers, but two of the male employees were also gawking at various girls and nudging and elbowing each other and staring. I have noticed this going at a two other restaurants, Rubios just up the street, and Port O Subs at Desert Ridge. And it's not like I'm looking for this, I just have a habit of noticing details in my surroundings. I would like to know if I am the only person in the world that notices things like this, because this behavior seems to be very common and management knows nothing (or does nothing) about it."}
{"text":"Food was yummy ordered chicken nuggets were crispy and fresh and the fries are real potatoes facilities are well maintained but I think what did it for me was the staff all attentive and service was awesome"}
{"text":"Speedy, efficient process with a friendly staff and delicious food?! Yes, please! This place rocks. I just wish they were open on Sundays"}
{"text":"Just because you want to stay the fasted drive thru in Arizona doesn't mean that the food should be made quick. The chicken nuggets were way over done and the fries were pale and soggy. I'm badly disappointed. Prefere it to take a little longer but being able to enjoy my food!"}
{"text":"If your looking for good fast food, Chick-fil-a is about as good as it gets.  Very consistant in both food quality and service.  Place is always clean, staff is cheerful and, they give back to the community."}
{"text":"I was so excited for the Sahara location to open because it is near my office and I rarely go to Henderson. Unfortunately, this location completely disappoints. There has been something wrong with my order each time. The last visit it took them over 25 min...it was early morning with only 5 customers. The employee gave our order to the person before us..he said he didn't order that and they took it  back and gave the same order back..not once..but twice before we realized it was our order. The other person put his hands all over it and we had to leave because I was late for work. We asked the manager for a refund and he looked at us and shrugged his shoulders ran the card offered no apology or anything. Ugh...looks like I'll be making the trip to Henderson..it runs much more smooth."}
{"text":"I love this place. Part of my daughter and my daily activity at this point. Always good breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My daughter loves the nuggets and fruit!"}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this restaurant.  I miss it so much that when my boyfriend and i are in AZ we plan the trip around how many times we can eat at Chick-fil-a!  I so wish you would bless us with just one in the state if WA. I'm willing to travel. But it is sumply the best chicken sandwich on the planet! !!!!!!   :-)"}
{"text":"Went in with a friend around 745 tonight. There was no one else in line and 3 associates in the drive thru area, all three looked at us and kept doing what they were doing. A fourth came from the back, looked at us and kept going, and a fifth came from the dining room put stuff down and then continued working on that. It took me saying something about the fact that we were just there to stand and not order food before anyone acknowledged us. Worst visit ever. The food was probably good but we left instead of ordering..."}
{"text":"To start off I love this location and their service, although tonight I went in and got spoken down to by the female manager of this location who should in my opinion have at least better customer service than the employees she is in charge of. They forgot an order of fries of mine so I went back in with receipt in hand to explain the situation. Any other fast food chain I would have brought the bags of food back in for proof but I thought Chick-Fil-A would have just taken my word because of the customer service they usually uphold and also it was just an order of fries. The manager on duty explained to me very rudely that \"it would be impossible\" to have forgot my order of fries because she \"verifies each and every bag\". I had to explain again that I was missing an order of fries and even offered to run outside and get the bag of food. She then told me \"let's not waste our time\" and proceeded to get me my order of fries. I come to this location once or twice a month and never had an experience like this. She even seemed to be talking down to her employees when I went in. I understand people have their bad days but don't take it out on other people especially employees or customers. I was very unpleased about my visit although Jonas up at the front running the register was awesome and very polite. The manager tonight should take a couple customer service pointers from him."}
{"text":"Oh wow! We love ChickFilA and I never thought I would ever be writing a bad review for CFA! But this LOCATION IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST! The place is filthy, workers are unfriendly and incompetent and the management could care less. Not once, not twice but THREE TIMES IN A ROW we received the WRONG ORDER in the drive through!  Every time we go here, the place is a mess, food all over the floor, dirty table after dirty table, sticky counters, employees who could care less about helping out. They are so cheap about everything. (really, I ordered 4 meals and you give me 2 napkins and 2 BBQ packets in the bag when I asked for \"lots of BBQ sauce\"?). The comment about the mints was spot on. They nickel and dime everything! I've had it and from now on we will be going to the location on Gilbert Rd and 202 even though it's farther, it's worth the extra minutes. Those people understand customer service over there! Maybe this location should take some training from them!"}
{"text":"The place was packed. Line out the door & cars wrapped around the parking lot for the drive through. Went in and ordered a couple of 8 piece grilled nuggets to go and was in & out in less than 10 minutes. Great customer service! I never eat fast food but had to see what the hype was all about. Good, not great, a little salty, & I thought the portion would be a little bigger."}
{"text":"Great food, great location and actually the best booth seats I've sat in within any fast food restaurant. Period. 

Get grilled chicken nuggets with Chick-fil-A with their specialty sauce and Buffalo Spicy sauce along with their shake and it's the perfect meal."}
{"text":"First of all, this restaurant is located in a very nice shopping plaza called Rivergate. 

Upon entering the parking lot, even in the cool temperatures, the smell from their garbage containment area overwhelms you, thus losing your appetite!

 I was again visiting the area a couple of days later and the temperature was about 45° with a moderate breeze out of the north. I was going to the Best Buy store and office supply store nearby, you could smell the rotten garbage smell from the dumpsters waftng all the way over there! This place is absolutely filthy, I do not recommend eating there for your health!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Anyone who give this place a one star like david V. is an idiot. Wastting too much time writing bad stuff about restaurants for what ? Seriously .? Who would give chick fil a one star?  David you wasting the real reason why god create you. Do you something good with all the time you spend online writing bad review about a restaurant and go save someone instead. Just because you dont get what you wan and go online like an idiot and whine about it? david you the reason why peple hate yelp and you give yelp a bad reputation.  You dont know the owner? if so prove it. David you are a total hater and no wonder why everyone avoid you like a plague that you really are. Let someone post review about you see what they say about you.  The world is not perfect so if you wan perfect world then go create one. Writing bad reviews about the restaurant just to prove that you are just another senseless weirdo ."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Quite frankly the best I have experienced in \"fast food\" 

Lisa greeted us when we walked in and our food was waiting because we used the iPhone App to place our order. Overall Excellent Experience A++"}
{"text":"Always exceptional service. Bobby J is pleasant and polite. Kudos for great customer service and great food"}
{"text":"Do not give these people your money. Possibly the rudest Chick-fil-A workers I have EVER encountered. I eat at chick fil a at least 3 times a week and I was astonished of how horrible their customer service was. Not once did I hear the words \"my pleasure\" and was handed the incorrect order after waiting 15 minutes. 

When I went to return my order, after ordering a spicy chicken sandwich and receiving a regular, the rude manager took it out of my hand and didn't say a word. 

I will never eat at this location AGAIN."}
{"text":"Love love love Chick-fil-A. 
Hate hate hate the lines and the traffic at this location. It's always busy no matter what time of day you go! One day, Chick-fil-A had 3 delivery trucks in their parking lot at one time. The entire parking lot became grid locked and every car was trapped in. They had to call the police to rectify the situation and direct traffic.  Instead of trying to over compensate and offer great service, the employees were staring out the windows watching the mess. :("}
{"text":"I realize I've been on a 5-star streak, but I really can't lie and say that Chick-fil-A doesn't deserve it for what it is, and for the sheer joy it brought me on Saturday.

I was driving around a million places. Baby was fussy. She finally fell asleep and I did NOT want to get her out of the car. (You know how you just drive around because you are desperate for time to yourself and you don't want the motion of removing the baby to wake them up?) Anyway. I'm realizing more and more what purpose drive-thrus serve. The purpose of making it slightly easier on someone with one or more whiny, tired, sleeping, or cranky kids in the car. So, yeah. From now on when I go through the drive-thru I say \"I'm not lazy. It's because of the BABY.\" uh huh.

Anyway, I have had a desire to try Chick-Fil-A ever since I (silly me!) tried to go there on a Sunday and it was closed. You wanna play hard to get, chicken? You're just not that into me? OK. I understand that game.

By the time I pulled into the parking lot on Center Ridge Rd., I admit it. I was desperate. I was so happy they had a drive-thru (I'd been counting on this, but realizing it might not happen). There were a few cars ahead of me so I had time to decide what to get. But I tried to play it cool and not stress it. 

Am I the only one who gets stressed out at a drive-thru if I've never been to the restaurant before, because there's not enough time to look at the menu? I think it's a valid concern. First of all, I need to see what they have. Then I have to make a good decision, because I can't change it once I've driven past the order window. Lastly, I have to deal with impatient fucknuts behind me who think that they're literally gonna DIE if they don't order YESTERDAY.

But I handled myself well. I got the deluxe sandwich, no drink, with an order of fries. Let me tell you. Those fries tasted (gasp!) like actual potatoes!!!!!! Oh my gosh. They were so good, and perfect for eating and driving. I saved the chicken sandwich until I got home. 

Of course the baby woke up as soon as I turned the car off, so I had to endure yet another \"eat against the clock\" fiasco until she started crying. But that's ok. I mean, fast food is meant to be shoved down your trap as fast as possible, right?"}
{"text":"Stopped by chick fil for a quick dinner. This location is very quick, clean, and had great service. The food was also great...but then again, isn't every chick fil a?? 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If they keep hiring these children they will continue to go downhill. On a busy Saturday they are laughing about silly stuff. Do your job or go home."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and tasty. 
Manager(black tall guy- sorry i dont know the name) and casher (steffanie) were super nice to me. 

I ordered breakfast biscuit , chicken mini meal and extra fry. Everything were fresh and tasty. 

U can tell they use fresh meat and oil. 
The sauces were yummy too. 
Its differnt than other fast food place.

I will definetely go back.  I wish they are going to open in southwest side too. Its faaaar from my palce lol"}
{"text":"I love Chick-til-A!!! I have never had a bad experience here ever!!! Until today I just left 2 minutes ago but I'm sitting in the car to write this review. I usually only come in later in the evening but Cox line was ridiculous so I came over to grab a quick bite. My girlfriend got nuggets fries and a coke. I got a spicy deluxe combo with a small chicken noodle soup and cheese sauce for my fries. We chose to dine in after waiting for a little over 10 minutes they bring the food(longest they've ever taken) my sandwich is totally wrong and it should have been called chicken flavored carrot soup I had a piece of chicken and two noodles. My gf takes the sandwich back and BOOM sandwich is wrong again terribly put together cheese ice cold chicken warm enough lettuce for a salad a single pickle! Shall I continue? I dress the crap sandwich the way I like it and bite into it because I'm hungry and tired of waiting at this point. Two bites in third bite in I'm done now highly disappointed my late lunch ruined I clear our table go to toss it and BOOM both cans over flowing with refuse. I look over at not 2 or 3 young employees but 7 of them 2 whom should've at least tried to look busy. I have worked in the food service industry for years so I understand a lot. If you have time to lean you have time to clean! We come here for the wonderful food and great service please don't make the manager do what LeBron just did to the Cavs to you all. Defend the LAND!!! P.S. the fries were great! Thanks"}
{"text":"Well I have been here a few times now and really like it.
It is very clean inside, the restrooms are clean as well. The staff is always pleasant ,even when they are very busy.
Now the chick-fil-A\"s all serve Breakfast as well. I have not got to try the Breakfast yet. But, I will one day soon. I have been checking out several different stores through out the Valley.
The food is always fresh here. I love their lemonade and they have an Ice tea that is not sweetened, which I love as well. I am not a fan of sweet drinks and I do not drink Soda. So I like that they have other Options. You can also buy Bottled water.
You might find it a little hard to find at first, even though it is on Ray Rd.
It is in the same parking lot as the AMC. That is the largest thing you can see from the road,so you can use that as a marker. Also there is a Petco in the same Parking Lot as well. From the street, the best marker perhaps is\" On The Boarder\" restaurant.
They do have a drive thru as well, but so far I have always just parked and gone in.
Give this place a try. It is fresh, hot, and very good."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I choose to go home down University Drive, I stop here. We all like it. The store is very clean, as well as a very friendly staff. A bit unusual for a fast food place. That is one of the reasons I like it so very much. I am not really a fan of the bun it comes on. So I may take a bite or two then, toss that part of it. 
But, no denying that the Chicken is wonderful and cooked just right. As well as the lovely Cottage fries. Or Waffle fries as they call them. They even have a drive through that makes it even nicer. I have to love Chick fil A"}
{"text":"I love this place the staff is fantastic the food is always fresh and good. I'm so happy that we have chick-fil-a in Las Vegas it would be even greater if we have one close to me in north Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I am not sure how long this Chick- fil-A has been at this location. But, I just discovered it in July 2017. In my opinion it is a great find.
I really like the fact that if I am shopping, getting a Massage, or doing anything else in the area I can just pop in here and I know it will be great!
McDonald's is right next door if you are finding a hard time finding it in the shopping center.
However, I would choose Chick-Fil-a any day over McDonald's.
The food is always cooked fresh here. So it is nice and hot and fresh. I have been here about 8 times now, and it has been good each time. We always get it to go because, it is always one of those days that I have 20 things to do.
They always ask you if you want any sauce and read your order back to you. Which is great because, I do not like pickles. So they come with the chicken Sandwich, they read it back and then I know if they got it right or not.
I always place my order and then go to the rest room to wash my hands. Then when I come out, it is pretty much ready. It is a great setup.

They have a nice Play gym for children inside. We know in the Summer here in Phoenix, it is far too hot to be seated outside for any reason.Yes, it is . Next week it will be 97 degrees and we will be past the point of October. you just have to be inside all the time during the day,. So it is very nice that they have that indoor playground.
Lots of parking in the lot and they do have a drive through.But, I never use it, I prefer to go inside. The ladies room is nice and clean."}
{"text":"We came here today after a very long walk. Chick Fil A is the place man. 
This is the king or should I say the Queen of fast food.
I know they have all the political stuff going on, but let us just deal with the food at this moment.
The chicken here is divine~ I mean really good!
I love the fries , cut fresh from a potato and just fried. They are fat and just perfect waffle fries. They use real green lettuce, find that any where else.
 I even got a lemonade, which is made from real lemons, sugar and pure water.
Of course they do have sauces and dips with good old High fructose corn syrup in it. But, you almost have to leave the country to find a place without it.
The food is great! The staff is well mannered and friendly, and the price is good.
I say that is all I need. Right O!
Plus, the staff all gets Sunday off, I give the owner major props for that . It is a really good thing."}
{"text":"This location was great for fast service, hot food, and friendly staff. My mom, brother, and I visited around 11 am for an early lunch. We placed our order for dine-in and were served our food in less than 5 minutes. The food was hot and fresh out of the fryer, and the ice cream was cold and not at all melted. The staff were very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. In conclusion, my family and I would visit this location again."}
{"text":"Great service from beginning to end! Ordered while on the way on their mobile app. When I got close by the app asked if I was ready to pickup. Walked in and immediately was greeted. The food was in my hands within about 15 seconds. Actually sat down to eat, and was asked while at my table if I needed anything. Clean restaurant  with great atmosphere of service and friendliness. Oh, and BTW, the order was exactly what I asked for and delicious."}
{"text":"Great customer service but the chicken was not that great, specially since I found hair in my chicken. Literally cooked into the chicken too. 4 gray short hairs I found, after that I stopped eating them. I am disgusted."}
{"text":"Went with my parents for lunch and had a great experience always so near and clean. Great staff and great food."}
{"text":"Although my family usually avoids fast food, occasionally, we do \"partake\" in it. I think in general, Chick-fil-A is one of the better fast food choices. The kids grilled chicken \"nuggets\" are tasty and don't seem like the artificial nuggets of other fast food places. They offer fruit as a side or waffle fries. The fries taste good, too. As far as this location, the times that I have gone here, I have always had helpful workers who are personable and very customer-service oriented."}
{"text":"Being someone from the Midwest, I can't really say enough about how much I love having Chick-Fil-A regularly and this one is right down the street from my house!  The service is always top-notch, even when there is a line stretching out onto Woodlawn and that is often.  Although a little...ok a lot....crowded at peak time, it's still worth the wait if you are craving a chicken sandwich like I so often am.  I also happen to HATE mayonnaise, so for me, the bun and the pickle is all I need, maybe a little Polynesian sauce on the side.  Their milkshakes are also really good....try the cookies and cream, lots of chunks of real Oreos and just thick enough."}
{"text":"I've already visited this place 5 times since opening. This is my go-to fast food restaurant because of their lemonade ice cream drink"}
{"text":"I swear the morning crew of this place is superior in guest service!! As a hiring manager, I'd gladly take any of these people on my staff! 

So early in the morning - both inside and drive thru staff are cheerful and so helpful! 

Your not just another person coming Thru the the queue. You A person, they make jokes they connect, they laugh. It's very refreshing!!!"}
{"text":"1 star is for not having the FULLLLLLL MENU in the morning. I was gonna rate this 2 stars cause they were nice and I'm a nice guy but NOPE. Vegas has been waiting for a Chick-Fil-A but this location gmfu. Stephanie got a full menu but not this location? I'd rather drive the extra miles for some Chicken Sandwiches and WHATEVER ELSE I WANT. 

Good people tho, Just didn't satisfy my needs."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food restaurants with good quality chicken. They give you a real piece of chicken in your sandwich that is juicy and and crispy!"}
{"text":"First time for me personally to eat here tonite. I was very impressed with everything. From the order to the finely and neatly stack condiments --- to the food. This place has got it together. For being a fast food joint-- it's very smooth in its operations. The employees are friendly and work hard-- which overflows into the cleanliness of the restaurant. 
I got the chicken wrap and my daughter the deluxe chik sammie. Both were very good and exceeded our expectations. 
I honestly just couldn't get over the condiment station -- how clean and organized it was. 
It was refreshing to see such pride taken in a fast food place. 
Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered at the drive thru, got home and an entire meal was missing. My ice tea also had no ice in it. Drove ALL the way back up there to retrieve my missing meal (I paid $21 so I was going to get my food). There were ATLEAST 15 employees on duty and there were only two or three actually working.  
The staff made me feel like I was wrong for coming back to get my missing food. But I got it and went home. Open the box and my sandwich is cold and doesn't have the extra pickles I asked and paid for. This store is off my list. They need some work."}
{"text":"There are a lot of fast food places out there but I have NEVER been to a place like this where the customer service is above and beyond any restaurant I've been to, fast food or not. It's hard to explain, you really just have to experience it yourself. It's not the \"my pleasure\" routine I'm talking about, it's the personal attention you get as a patron. There are staff circulating the dining room asking if you need a beverage refill, or anything else. I was very impressed and will continue to come here for lunch."}
{"text":"Terrible service.. the drive through girl laughed at me ordering, took way too long and when my phone app wouldn't scan she decided to get the most rude Latino lady ever who proceeded to give me a disgusting look as well as continuing to tell my my phone app doesn't work after just trying one time but after i insisted she try again it magically worked!!! She needs to be fired. Worst experience i've had at any Chick fil a and I'm embarrassed you call yourselves a part of their franchise."}
{"text":"Never been to a Chick-fil-A, came today to try it , so simply and easy to read  menu. My wife loved it and so did I. I'm not saying wow! incredible sandwiches . Just simple and delicious . We are for sure coming back. You be the judge of it , very very good for the first time visit. Check it out....."}
{"text":"I love this Chick-fil-A but most of their old employees left and they had to hire new ines other than that the food is great."}
{"text":"Best chic fil a in town , their Service is always above and beyond and their food at this restaurant seem to taste a little better than the other Chick-fil-A's in in town."}
{"text":"A must in any town. Used to drive to Utah now is here in town ahhh progress. But I must admit that the size of the nuggets are getting smaller but cost is not shrinking."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. Just tasted like a fast food chicken sandwich. The sauce was pretty dam good though."}
{"text":"I eat at this chic fil a about once or twice a week. Every time I go through the drive through I receive the worst service. Inside, I receive moderate service. But at the drive through I always get stuck with some sassy girls that are trying to rush me through. And it's only this chic fil a. All the others I've been to are awesome and have great service so I expect great service from chic fil a. Disappointed. 

P.S. THEY FORGOT MY SAUCE AGAIN AHH!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best chicken ever...sorry colonel sanders Nothing better around and so glad the franchise arrived in Las Vegas. I've been enjoying chick-fil-a for years in Ohio now my joy is finding the franchise approval for Las Vegas. I've been treated with nothing but pleasantries and huge, warm smiles Plus I am very proud and happy that they, along with a few other company's, choose to NOT operate on Sundays in respect for our Lords day set aside for family"}
{"text":"Great quick service but this time I received 3 chicken nuggets when ordering 6. Was very disappointed considering they were not busy at all."}
{"text":"I was really REALLY disappointed in this location. I'm originally from California, and LOVE chick fil a!! But I stopped here yesterday after a long drive home coming from California.. and not only did they completely mess up my order, the chicken was SO THIN. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich meal and they rung me up for the deluxe so I ended up paying more for something I didn't order. Not only was I upset about that but my boyfriend hated his sandwich it was completely overcooked and dry along with my thin chicken patty. I have never had an experience like this before, and I really hope it is corrected."}
{"text":"Ohh why do you always forget my chick-fil-a sauce. You batting .200 with my chick-Fil sauce. I love it so and you always forget. You say \"Chris why don't you just look in the bag\" because I got looked in my eye by the man with the tie and he said \"yes\" it's in the bag. It's never in the bag. I munch my fries and chicken club with such sadness when u forget my chick-fil-a sauce. It's all I can think about in my ride home. I say to myself \"I bet they forgot my sauce\" Waaaaaa. I cry and go to bed so unsatisfied. But I keep coming back for that most amazing Tang. I think I've gone insane and I'm starting to think they keep it out of my chicken bag in purpose!!"}
{"text":"alright seriously.. my friends and I are going through the drive thru, not only is there a guy standing out in the 108 (not lying) degree temp, but then there's another guy running to my car window to get payment to make the transaction as fast as possible. I have never had someone run for fast food like that. good job chick fil-a, you made us feel like rockstars."}
{"text":"I'm not coming back again to this place
Simply it's not what I was expecting
Small sandwich small size of chicken strips I'm still hungry"}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype. Maybe it's something you had to grow up with. I won't complain about the lack of condiments because you could just add your own and it would still be no better or worse than any other fast food chicken. Gave two stars because the service was good."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this Chick-Fil-A I leave in a better mood than when I came in! The entire staff here is so polite and amazing! One of their employees literally just walked me to my car in the pouring rain while holding an umbrella over my head so I wouldn't get wet, meanwhile he's getting soaked!! Now that's what I call customer service!! Thanks Chick-Fil-A, you guys are awesome everytime!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service, clean and the food is superb.   My kids enjoy playing here and have cool goodies.   They also do books for 3 and under.   I never had a complaint and love their food choices.  If I had to choose McDonald or chick fil a it would be chick fil a."}
{"text":"I have been to many locations but this was very frustrating! The line for the drive-thru was long so I went in. I was using the new app to check in and it was acting up. I ordered from the counter- 2 meals with chocolate shakes, I waited and they gave me 1!!! GRRR! The were screwing up on exchanging, I suggested just refund and rering. Finally right- so much for faster by running inside!!!!!!! Not sure if I will go back!"}
{"text":"Free coffee all month! I am not a coffee drinker but the employee recommended the French vanilla, so I tried it... evaluation. ..it is good!!  The grilled chicken strips are always delicious, i can eat a quick meal and be healthy! I dig the kid placemats and the staff, well they are THE NICEST in town!!!!"}
{"text":"While I do like Chick-fil-a, some things I like more than other. I was thrilled to walk in today and see the \"empty seat at the table\" for Memorial day to honor our soldiers who have passed on!! I really like the peach sh as kes, but the 4 piece nuggets wss a joke! $2.08 plus tax for 2 bites of chicken. Not a good deal!!!! It w as super busy though, so I guess I am not the only one who likes Chik-en!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken nuggets, wasn't a fan of them at all. Waited 30 minutes in drive thru and didn't even eat the food- I've never had chick fil a before and I don't think I'll be going back. I'm not really sure what the big deal is? There's defiantly better chicken places in town. & again I only had the chicken nuggets & waffle fries, so I'm not sure about anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS! Friendly staff and quick service for being so busy. I couldn't care less about the political side of it, so don't bug me with that non-sense. I'm still gonna eat there and happily give them my money!"}
{"text":"Customer service is extraordinary. Came in with a 3 families and eager to play in their play area. Edgar and Zeek took care of our families and made our experience great! Thank you"}
{"text":"Chicken is bomb. Order it with pepper jack cheese! I didn't like the chick fil a said at first but it grew on to me. Spicy chicken and honey mustard goes well together. Breakfast biscuit is bomb. Grilled chicken and egg white sandwich is OK. I think because my egg whites were burned. They came brown and crispy - McDonald's makes better eggs whites, but at least the grilled chicken was good."}
{"text":"Love this chick fil A! We have been going to this location for many years and we always get excellent service, I never have to wait too long to get my food     even when it's crowded, the employees work so hard, thank you chick fil A!"}
{"text":"Great fast food!!! Yummy chicken!!!!  Always superb service!
Great Breakfast too!!!!"}
{"text":"I go to this Chick-fil-A pretty often for lunch, and the chicken sandwiches and fries consistently taste fresh.  Overall, for the price and the speed of service, I am very satisfied."}
{"text":"Just stopped by yesterday to try it out again for the second time and this time the food was cooked perfectly. I applaud this location for being organized and well managed with the huge amounts of people visiting this location daily. I was so impressed with their service and food quality we have planned a team lunch in the next coming weeks at this location."}
{"text":"After horrible messing up our order normally is great but after finding this hair in my food I will never eat at none of them again soooo gross on top of being cold!! Horrible not worth a penny"}
{"text":"This chick fila is so close to my house and I have always had a good experience here. If they mess up my order they are always happy to correct the mistake. Yesterday morning In the drive through I was given beyond custom service then what I ever expected! She helped me out so much! Thank you! Also Gabriel has always given us great service!"}
{"text":"I have had some good experiences at Chick-fil-A, but I have also had a couple bad experiences where I have felt sick afterwards.

A compliment that I can give is that the employees certainly are very pleasant and polite. It is actually pretty surprising for a fast food type place.

The food is decent and reasonably priced. It just needs to be a little more consistent."}
{"text":"Spent $20 on 3 meals. Cold fries and luke warm chicken.  One chicken sandwich was full of gristle and fat.  Never going back..."}
{"text":"No doubt is the best fast food restaurant around in my opinion.   I have visited the drive thru countless times and every single time- order accuracy and friendly service.    My favorite is the chicken sandwich #1.  There is nothing else like it.   My 2nd favorite is the grilled chicken sandwich.. very tasty with honey mustard.  The waffle fries.. never greasy and so good.    I have used Chick Fil A - catering dozens of times and always accurate and a hit with everyone at the office.  

No matter what time of the day I visit the resturant .. its always packed - so the opposite of hit or miss - its right on point- people !  

  Thanks Chick Fil A   !!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place! Had the spicy salad and it was good! No complaints! Service was fast! Drivethru was fast and convenient as it should be. Great place for a salad and chile lime dressing!"}
{"text":"This more better than when they open. No mad house. Tried the market salad . Looks and taste delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Go Jesus!!! There food is great and the people that work there are great people! They one time gave me a free meal just because they wanted too!!"}
{"text":"This chick fil a location is always busy, which I assume is because of the freshly made food and friendly employees. During peak hours you will find employees standing in the drive thru line to take orders, ensuring the line speeds right along. In the Arizona heat this is no easy task. I highly recommend the spicy chicken deluxe sandwich with pepper jack cheese but really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. If you happen to swing by during breakfast hours definitely try the sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. We don't eat fast food hardly ever but chick fil a is the exception."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Chic-fil-a. Glad I did! Food was great, had some chicken biscuits for breakfast. The owner Ken was incredibly friendly and helpful. Excellent experience! Will stop by here again whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service & after 4 tries & not getting an order right or being personal or caring about their customers to make it better I wouldn't go back. I told the manager & I got an apology."}
{"text":"Taking into consideration that this is a CFA express, this is still the worst cfa in existence.. 

I don't want that to seem like an exaggeration. The food can sit there anywhere from 5 min (yea right..) to an hour.. Food always tastes like it's been on the higher end of that timeframe. 

Honestly don't think I've ever even been able to finish my meal. The only reason I get it (which is very rare) is when I'm working from home and need something quick. I think this might be the only time I've ever thought that it's probably a good thing this one isn't open on Sundays. or Saturdays. Or after 3pm.."}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with my visit to Chik-fil-A. I ordered an 12 piece nugget meal, which comes with fries and a drink. Unlike most fast food places, they bring you your food. The food came out very quickly and was nice and hot. All of the food tasted great, and their lemonade is very refreshing. Not only is the food good, but the service is unmatched. For a fast food restaurant the workers are all very kind, and even offered to refill my drink! The only downside, is that so many other people love coming here it's often very busy, although they do a great job of getting people orders done quick and their food out fast. Overall they turn fast food into a great experience."}
{"text":"Used curbside service for the 1st time via the app. It asks for a description of your vehicle. All of the curbside spots were full and no people were in the cars. When my food was brought outside, it was hard for her to find me since I was not in a curbside spot. I would try this service again to see if it's faster next time"}
{"text":"I think the solar eclipse is affecting things!

This is the 1st time I EVER received something incorrect at Chick Fil A!!

I ordered a egg white grill and got to my destination and it's on a biscuit! Just messing up my caloric intake! It normally comes on a wheat English muffin (way less calories). I called the location and Alan( I think) and Caleb  answered the phone at the same time. I informed them about the issue. They asked if I could return. I told them I could but breakfast will be over by then. He offered to send me a coupon in the mail.

I still think the eclipse messed up something. I don't eat fast food often, and this week I had to rely on it heavily due to my busy schedule. Every place I visited, my food has been incorrect. I guess it's back to cooking for me..."}
{"text":"It's CFA, what's not to like?! It's clean, comfortable and affordable. The staff are friendly, professional and helpful, unlike most fast-food joints. CFA always provides great good at great prices. I'm hooked on the spicy chicken!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of chicken sandwiches and lemonade but the chicken sandwich I received was very Bland and the frozen lemonade taste like  a yoga"}
{"text":"Ahh Chick-fil-A... The holiest of all fast food chains (no pun intended) 

In this review I will comment on Chick-fil-A as a franchise in general as well as this specific location. 

This is the only fast food restaurant that gives me some type of vibe when I am there eating. You are greeted when you walk in, everyone is smiling, all the employees respond with \"My pleasure!\" This is an overall eating experience that you can only get from Chick-fil-A! 

As far as the food goes, it's all good, really really good! I usually go with the spicy chicken sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich or the strips. Don't forget the Polynesian sauce on EVERYTHING! One of my favorite things about Chick-fil-A is when you ask for sauce they ask you how many. EXCUSE ME?!?! You mean I don't have to use one sauce for 2 lbs of food??!?! God forbid you ask for extra sauce at McDonalds... they act like they are hand churning the sauce and packaging it up themselves. 

Once you order they hand you a little plastic cup thingy and you can go sit down. Yes, they even bring your food to you when it's ready!  Once you start to eat they even have an employee that is walking around the dining room periodically checking on you and getting you refills!!! I'll give you a second to catch your breath... 

Once I was finished with my meal I went to wash my hands and freshen up. While in the restroom I caught myself humming the instrumental music that is lightly playing throughout the restaurant but is more prominent in the restroom. The song I was humming was \"Open the eyes of my heart Lord\" I knew at this very moment I needed to go to church the following Sunday. And I just wanted to thank Chick-fil-A for getting me back into a more spiritual mood as of late since this location opened and is very accessible to me. 

I cannot say enough good things about this place. I am happy when I know I am going, I am happy while I am eating and I am happy the rest of the day knowing I ate there earlier. If I had to guess I would say I have been at Chick-fil-A hundreds and hundreds of times and ALWAYS had a pleasurable experience!

P.S. Drew the manager is absolutely spectacular. His positive attitude reflects on the entire staff and the restaurant as a whole. I am not kidding when I say I come to Chick-fil-A not only for the food but the overall dining experience, and there are not many restaurants I can say that about!"}
{"text":"This is a Chick-fil-A that delivers on the Chick-fil-A brand. Great restaurant and very clean with great staff and a wonderful playground. 

It's just chicken but somehow they make it addictive."}
{"text":"Fast fried chicken. I do really like Chick-Fil-A, but I can't say that it's my favorite thing in the world. My husband goes wild for it, but I just can't seem to muster up the same level of excitement. This location is a typical mall food court restaurant. Tons of teenagers and wild children, morose workers, and strange line formations. 

Some nuggets, a ton of sauce and those waffle fries are good when I have them, but I wouldn't really go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the management and service at the actual drive up window.  
I ordered a dm shake for my daughter.  The young man taking the order super polite and efficient. 
I pay one person and received my order from another.  Told to have a good night.  It wasn't until I was few miles away with my wallet on my lap did I realize they never gave me my change back $17. I called, spoke to someone about it... felt like I need to justify myself and was told to drive up and get it. So I sit in the drive through line waiting to get my money, get to the window and the kid looks at me \"like what?\"  I said \"my change???\" \"Oh\" hands me my $17 and NOTHING.... no sorry for your inconvenience ... or maybe.... here the shake is on us... nothing.... so much for the whole \"my pleasure\" crap. 
I called after I left, honestly a little pissed and asked for the manager... she politely listen but honestly felt like she could care less."}
{"text":"Grand opening day. It's true what they say, Chicken is juicy and tasty. \"Eat More Chicken!\"
The Manager and his crew are awesome and friendly!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A but this one is the best. Very nice and clean as usual but the employees are exceptional. I will return. Thanks for the great service keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place but, i was disappointed when i did. The food is average for fast food and its pricey for the portion sizes. I do like that they offer a fruit cup with an assortment of fruit and the service is very professional and nice. Overall i would not eat here again it's too expensive for the amount."}
{"text":"Oh chick fil a how I love you! The lines moved quickly, my food came out fast & hot, and the staff is impeccable. I got the #4 meal (add bacon) and asked for Polynesian sauce. I think the lady behind the counter knew about my love for this sauce so she really loaded me up. This sandwich is my favorite and the waffle fries are to die for. Chick fil a is definitely my favorite fast food, and it being so convenient in the airport was even better! My meal even came with a little Wet Nap & a Chick fil a mint! How cute!"}
{"text":"really don't want to give one star. greasy dark fried strips. had to dab oil off with napkins. 
chicken noodle soup had zero chicken in it. 
the restaurant seats, table and floors were filthy. 
quit promoting your app and spend more time having employees clean the place. monitor your oil and temperatures. I won't go to any chik fil a's again.  Posted a pic of greasy chicken in box but I wouldn't be surprised if the pic doesn't get posted."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst chickfila I've ever been to. The cashiers were incompetent--even after they correctly repeated my order back to me, I was incorrectly and overly charged."}
{"text":"Just went here last night the food was not fresh it taste like it had been sitting out,French fries were not cooked all the way through me and boyfriend were eating and the lady that worked there started mopping right by us.I told her we are  eating and I don't want to smell cleaning supplies while I was eating it was a whole other section she could have been mopping super rude. I will not be returning here again shame on this location."}
{"text":"Nuggets or a chicken salad sandwich, waffle fries, extra chick-fil-a sauce, and a cookies and cream milkshake, freshly brewed sweet tea, or fresh lemonade! You can't go wrong. Friendly, positive staff as well."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop in for breakfast on Monday 4/11/2016.  Normally this is an excellent stop for any meal but today I can only rate it as mediocre.  

The tortilla on the chicken burrito that I had this morning was hard and crusty to the point that I felt like I was tearing at it with my teeth in order to eat it.  The Frosted coffee however was excellent and caused me to raise my rating one star up to 3 total.

I was also pretty disappointed to see two or three members of The Establishment standing around talking on cell phones and to each other instead of coming around and asking people about their meals.  My issue was a very simple one that they could have remedied very quickly had they come around to the tables like they normally do.

At the time I came into the restaurant I think I was only the third or fourth person eating inside so it's not like they were very busy or anything in the interior of the place."}
{"text":"Edit::::: Corporate messaged and called back after I called and told them what happen. I didn't want to go back but... I just left there and they made me a veggie wrap and a refund for the wrap and fries disaster. Wow. Ok. 

I do know that if I'm desperate and too lazy to get a sushi burrito a few blocks down, I can go here BUT just check the order after the drive through to make sure I didn't get a mess!!!! From one to three stars because this veggie wrap is really good!!!!!!! (see my pic)







I just wasted $19.10. Oh well. Fail.

Soo for the past 1-2 years ever since MommyTang did a MukBang on vegan at Chick-fil-A I wanted to go there. Even despising the company and their ethics I thought it would be fun.

I wrote a list exactly what to ask for and here is how it turned out: a total disaster.

Super food side: actually this was an edible item. I'm scared to know what the dressing is and I don't like sugar nuts, so those got tossed. For $3 something it was ok.

Fruit cup: smelled kinda weird, like an old refrigerator and I'm pretty sure they toss everything in sugar.

Half unsweetened tea half lemonade: was looking soooo forward to this item but instead it just tastes like a sugar water with lemon juice in it. How much sugar does this company have to put into their products?!?! Wow.

Fries: nightmare. They were half cold, half sooooo fried they crunched like a potato chip. No joke. Somehow they rang up two large sides and I only got one. Also they are soooooo salty they hurt my tongue. 

Veggie Cool wrap: it wasn't at all. They gave me a chicken wrap that smelled rotten and the only thing other than chicken on it was lettuce, red cabbage and carrot. This was suppose to be:::: Corn, carrots, black beans, red cabbage, tomatoes, and lettuce, all wrapped in a flaxseed flat bread. Unbelievable.

Sauces: I asked to all the vegan sauces they offer. See my pics. They all tasted the same. Sugar and salt gel. Just different tangy levels.

Call me CLEAN but I have learned my lesson. It's no wonder 'Murica has the diabeetus and super obesity. 
I feel sick and dizzy just eating a few fries, some superfood side, a few drinks of sugar salt water, fruit cup, and tastes of sauces.

I called them to tell them about their chicken mess up and the lady who answered sounded like blah blah. She has probably been sugar and salted today.

Two thumbs down. See my pics."}
{"text":"Can NEVER go wrong with Chick-fil-A! Love the sweet tea, shakes, and chicken sandwich. Of course long line since it's still pretty new here in Vegas. But it goes very quick and they're so good about keeping it all organized with their 1,000 employees on staff lol but seriously. Amazing."}
{"text":"Chick fil a at the Waterfront sucks so bad. Every time my fiancé and I go in there the food sucks. We go in there so much and got one or two fresh meals. The other times the chicken isn't fresh or the fries aren't. Cold, under cooked or over cooked fries  At first we got an apology for putting pickles on my sandwich then after months we found hair in our fries and got no apologie. The manager thought we lied. Then the drinks are 9/10 nasty! I finally say something about my drink and basically get called a liar! So never go to that one!!"}
{"text":"Okay I knew I wasn't gonna stay away long after the horrible service I received last time. I was hungry been at work all day and still hadn't made it home so I decided to stop. Pulled up and the pleasant gentleman that was standing there took my order at the menu board and since I had a card I was able to pay with him. Pulled around to the 2nd gentleman in the middle who called my name and gave me my receipt. Pulled around to the window and it took a little minute to get my food but the young lady made small talk with me till my food was ready. SHE DIDN'T CLOSE THE WINDOW AND SHUT ME OUT!!! Yes Chick Fil A you are redeeming yourself to the c customer service I've grown to love. I think they had to make my wake fries cause they were piping hot! 

Got my food and immediately dug into my bag for those delicious yummy hot waffle fries. There's just never enough of them.  Nonetheless they were absolutely cooked to perfection. My spicy deluxe chicken sandwich was absolutely amazing, juicy, and flavorful. And to rinse it all down I had some of the BEST lemonade on the planet and nobody can tell me any different!!! 

Thank you guys for restoring my faith in you guys and providing me with the continued excellent customer service. You haven't lost me as a customer yet so keep doing what you're doing!!!"}
{"text":"One of the times that this location was not busy. Walked right up and redeemed a free 4ct due to my free monthly calendar treat. Saw advertisement for a limited time white peach tea lemonade. I asked if I could get it with diet lemonade. Yes and yes. All is well with me."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A biscuits are excellent ,every worker is respectful , and drive thru is great it's all around excellent service and great food!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location at least a dozen times and have always had great service. Any issues that we've had food wise which have always been minor, we're rectified right away. Food is good and fresh and chicken sandwiches and salads are always a pleasant change from burger shops. The kids play area is on the small side, but kids always seem to have fun. Plus it's always clean which I'm sure is easier due to the smaller size. 

On this occasion I stopped in for a free bowl of chicken tortilla soup that had come by way of their text club. They occasionally send texts for free or discounted food which is always nice. This soup was different from the usual chicken tortilla soup I'm used to in that it had a lot of navy beans. It had good flavor and crisp tortilla chips on the side. I will continue to frequent this location for their good service and great food!"}
{"text":"Every time I try to give this chik fil a a chance, they let me down. Courtney told the other worker not to add extra lemonade and less ice cream to my frosted lemonade, which is a small hurdle to keep a customer. Usually, the service here is super slow as well. But that just goes to show the location needs improvement. I won't be back. I will drive the extra distance to the Northlake location. They are always amazing."}
{"text":"Frosted lemonade on a hot day nothing better!! A new employee in training today was our cashier, what a nice polite young man!!"}
{"text":"The service is always great, even when super busy. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because they never get my order correct. A cob salad with grilled chicken should not be that hard to mess up. When you have to tell them several times grilled chicken and not grilled nuggets, and they still get it wrong, there's a problem. The staff need to be better trained if they are having issues understanding how to take and correctly make orders."}
{"text":"This is probably one of our favorite of the fast food places. It is just about the only chain place that I will order chicken nuggets from, as are chunks of chicken instead of pressed/molded. Each location has a kids night, and my daughter regularly asks to go to these.  I went on line to view their menu, and found out all the offerings they do to help you ordering. Needless to say, now that I know protein-style is an option, it's the way that I order their grilled chicken sandwiches. =)"}
{"text":"I love the food they have, and their service is great... EXCEPT that I don't get what I order so I will take my business elsewhere. It doesn't make sense to me that 3 times in a row I order the Cobb Salad with spicy BATTERED crispy chicken but every time they give me the standard grilled chicken. :(  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent and energetic customer service. Food is great. At first I thought having a pickle on my chicken sandwich was disgusting. Then I tried it and it tastes great."}
{"text":"Love the employees at chick-fil-a! Normally I dine-in but with a newborn is was easiest just to go thru the drive-thru, and shout out to the employees that are out there in this Arizona heat taking orders with a HUGE smile :) decided to try the new BBQ Bacon Sandwich but only thing missing was the BBQ in my sandwich??? seems like they placed a nickle size of BBQ. Paying $10.13 for a small size meal expecting BBQ in your sandwich then realizing once you get home that you didn't get BBQ sauce is not acceptable. Tried calling the store manager but phone number states \"not accepting calls at this time\". Well looks like I'm out of luck trying to talk to someone at the restaurant and fixing the situation. Would have been an amazing sandwich I'm sure if it had BBQ sauce, bacon was delicious btw!"}
{"text":"Fast food is not really my thing, but I really like this Chick-Fil-A. Other than the food being pretty good (amazing for fast food) but they have Family Nights on Thursdays (http://www.cfarestaurant.com/santanvillagemarketplace/events). I assume the other Chick-Fil-A's do as well, but I've only seen them advertised at this particular location. I took my children there tonight and for $15 (cost of dinner) my 5-year old was able to make a sock snowman craft (turned out really cute), have face-painting (by a professional, not a bored teenager) and a balloon animal (or princess, buzz light-year, batman, whatever the case may be). I was thoroughly impressed with the event and can't wait to go back for the next one.

Besides all that, the restaurant was clean. The food was fresh and the chicken wasn't gross. The staff was super friendly and uber polite. I was fan! Great place to spend the evening with your family."}
{"text":"Service and staff are on top of everything and give wonderful service to their customers.  I don't go to Chick-fil-A like I have in the past.  The slaw that they discontinued after 20 years or so, was that extra side that got me to order from there.  If they brought that back you would see me there more than twice a year now."}
{"text":"Always crowded, always delicious, always closed on Sunday.

Hands down the best tasting, juiciest and yummiest chicken nuggets ever. Dipped in Chick-fil-a sauce, and I'm happy! Not a fan of their waffle fries...never have been, never will.
This place is always busy, no matter when you come...because all the food is made fresh to order. Well worth the wait. 

Just tried their fresh squeezed lemonade with Splenda and it is soooo good!"}
{"text":"A secret Santa just bought everyone's food in the whole restaurant!! 
And of course, the service was excellent and the food was great"}
{"text":"This is purely for their service on the app that let's you order ahead. We made an order through the app last weekend. This is supposed to save time, since their drive through is usually about a 15 min wait. Turns out they told us they don't start making that order until you come to the window. Ah excuse me? If I wanted to wait another 15 min, I wouldn't have used the app and gone through the drive thru or ordered to go inside. Take a page from Panera if you're worried about food getting cold or not showing up. On their app, you order, set your pick up time then pay. We'll never use the app and/ order that way ever again!"}
{"text":"Om nom nom. I love the service of this location! Always fast and friendly. They get my order right every time - get the cobb salad but sub for grilled chicken instead of the breaded to save on calories."}
{"text":"So I decided to go here for breakfast today and I was disappointed that they opened at 6:30am instead of 6:00am just like the other ones.  I decided to wait anyway and other people must have had the same thing in mind.  I am a huge fan of their spicy chicken biscuits but I forgot they don't carry those anymore so I opted for the regular chicken biscuit combo.  

My oh my oh my oh my!!!!  I ate my hash brown in the car to work because I didn't want them to get cold on my 30 minute commute into work after this pit stop.  I am at work now and believe it or not the chicken biscuit was still very warm and the biscuit was still fluffy.  Perfectly buttered biscuit with that delicious chicken I am in heaven again.  

It's a little out of my way to go here before work but I will be coming back again and make that sacrifice (my time) to enjoy some good food and service.  

Again they always knock it out of the park."}
{"text":"I went to Chick-fil-a a few days ago.  I don't go there too often but I am starting to get hooked.  The food isn't anything special, but the level of service is AMAZING.  They are efficient at getting food out and they do it with a smile!  Even at 9:00pm when they are starting dining room clean up and preparing for closing, I received my food within a minute of ordering.

I gave them a four star rating for excellent service and food that makes me feel I am in a Panera instead of any other fast food place."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A as does my whole family. We are frequently at this location. Recently it's seemed like a staff turn over and to be completely honest...I've had issues with two of the workers recently. One being a cashier who I have encountered now 3x. Every time I see her she looks like she's had a rough shift and doesn't feel welcoming. She seems annoyed with my business more than anything. She does say the company required, \"my pleasure.\" However it's obvious it is definitely not at her pleasure, more like being forced against will! Haha. I hope the owners will take recent employee complaints from multiple customers and do another turn over to make my home Chick-fil-A better again!"}
{"text":"What a cluster-f*ck!  This is one of the most disorganized fast food restaurant I've ever seen.  Needs a complete overhaul of its staff and procedures."}
{"text":"This is the 2'nd time that I've had issues with a drive-thru order at this location. One time I was given the wrong order - chicken nuggets instead of chicken fingers. Today, I ordered a side salad and a small iced coffee. When I got to the office, the container wasn't even half full of salad. To add insult to injury, my silverware packet was already torn open!!  Luckily I was able to find a plastic fork at work. This particular Chick-fil-A is tarnishing the whole Chick-fil-A customer service oriented reputation!"}
{"text":"Great location, but horrible place to go if you're on a time crunch especially if you go during your thirty minute lunch break.

It's great location but always has a line!"}
{"text":"Good food. The place is great for families with young kids. They have cherrios and diapers available for free. Very friendly staff. This location is my favorite chick fil a."}
{"text":"Ok, yes I am writing a review for a fast food restaurant. I realize that seems a bit strange and quite possibly extremely unnecessary. I mean, fast food is fast food right? Everyone knows what their getting into and what kind of food to expect, right? While this is true I felt it was worth writing a little snippet for the always refreshing Chick-Fil-A.

It's nice to have a fast food experience where the food tastes fresh and actually like real chicken. The nuggets are yummy, flavorful but not overbreaded. My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy. We also enjoyed the sweet tea which is a classic Chick-fil-A staple.

One important thing to note was that this location was super busy when we walked in right at noon but soon after we ordered our food was ready in a flash. And for those of you who have never been to CFA before? The icing on the cake is the wonderful assortment of dipping sauces to suit whatever flavor mood you are in at the moment. Or you can do what I do and open one of each and dip to your hearts desire. Who doesn't love variety?!"}
{"text":"This place is running too fast for it's own good. Multiple items were left out of my order today which is extremely frustrating when you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I've avoided the other locations since I heard from a lot of people how crazy it was getting but today, my craving was too strong to ignore.

The location is in a pretty good spot with ample parking & access to the highway. The line was out the door but 2 employees took orders efficiently & customers just paid at the cashier. 

Seating areas were clean & employees were super friendly. Food was warm & so good. No complaints here. Glad you're here now Chik-fil-A. It means no more random drives to St. George, lol. :)"}
{"text":"Yummy every time! I can eat ths food every day!"}
{"text":"My daughter and eight of her friends (ages 15-16) went to this Chick Fil A location on Thursday, May 25, 2017 after school, approx. 2:30-3pm.  
EVERY SINGLE PERSON who was in this group, was throwing up within a 24 hour time frame.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON!!  It is midnight on Saturday night and they are all just starting to feel normal.  All of the kids ate chicken nuggets and fries.  I am wondering how many other people were sick after eating here on this day.  Someone needs to check quality control and sanitation at this location!!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Charlotte, I've been to A LOT of chick fil a's. I started working down the street from this one and wasn't expecting much due to the area, but this is by far the best chick fil a i have ever been to. The food always tastes so fresh and perfectly cooked. The service is SO quick, even at lunch rush i don't think I've ever waited more than a minute for my food. And everyone is so friendly. Don't let the location fool you."}
{"text":"Make sure you check your bag for all your items. Hard to eat a salad with no dressing."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chickfila in the greater Charlotte area. The staff is extremely helpful and caring and they serve the food extremely quickly but still maintaining the great standard of quality. The staff will come and clear your table when you are done with your food and then wipe it when you leave for the next client. The food itself is always excellent whereas some other locations are hit and miss."}
{"text":"Love this Chick Fil A. The workers are always friendly and welcome you as you walk in. Great location on Independence as it's not busy with only one by Mathews. The food as always is good and the store is always clean. Just a good Chick Fil A store."}
{"text":"Great location great quality food that is always hot and fresh.. Generally this chain is the cleanest most sanitary you can go to so
Quality is never a question here... Plus the forces always stop and eat here which i guess is another good indication"}
{"text":"Great chicken at this location. The spicy chicken sandwich is awesome and so are the nuggets. All of the sauces are also delicious and accommodate the chicken very well. My personal favorites have got to be the Polynesian and buffalo. Also the buttermilk ranch is on point. Enjoy your next visit with a refreshing lemonade. God bless"}
{"text":"I have to eat grilled chicken only. Went to drive thru got regular nuggets. Management sent me a certificate to make it right, great. Go in and they don't honor what certificate says.....then ask for a ice cream and chocolate said they don't do sundaes?? Good try management but....."}
{"text":"Great food as usual but the service at this location is very slow. I definitely prefer the arboretum location"}
{"text":"I'm done with Chic-Fil-A, at Davis Lake. Constant let down on weekend service. It's like they have the B team in there on Saturdays. I order a small tray of nuggets all the time from Huntersville location,  at lunch hour. That's the fastest, most economical way to feed a family of 4. Go to Davis Lake and try to order it and all they do is biatch and moan. No worries, I take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everyone here is so mice. I especially liked Analyse who helped me in the drive thru the other night. She made sure my order was perfect and gave me a new drink no questions asked after I didn't like my first one! She truly went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"It was my first Chick-Fil-A experience ever!

I loved it.  The service was SOOOO NICE!  Everybody who worked there had such a pleasant attitude.  Being from Miami, the city of terrible service, I was just knocked out by the service alone.  They brought our food to the table so we wouldn't have to wait the 2mins it would take to put it together.  The place was spotless.  Clean as a whistle!

The food was great.  I had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich.  Caliente party in my mouth!  The waffle fries win, win, win, no matter what!  Fresh lemonade?!?!  Seriously!

I'm sad because there aren't any near me.  :'-("}
{"text":"By far the worst CFA I have ever been to. Very rude guy at the register, dirty tables and my food literally took 15 minutes. Ice cream machine has been \"broken for days\", according to employees while they laugh about it. Pretty pathetic and very disappointing for their standards. So incredibly slow. My order was also wrong but after waiting so long I just ate it. Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The chicken bagel breakfast sandwich is the best fast food item you can get in the morning anywhere! Do yourself a favor and try one especially if you liked to be filled up."}
{"text":"I take my wife and 2 girls here all the time until recently. Management couldn't do their job and stop the taller-overweight kids from going into the play area. My wife asked the manager to so something and after 15 minutes of waiting I found the kids parents and told them off myself.  I wouldn't have made a scene if management had balls and did what they were supposed to."}
{"text":"Finally a Chick Fil A that is close to where I live and work. Yeah! I think they are great. Really good chicken sandwich. Plain and simple. Although I do add mayo and mustard to it. Got to love waffle fries!!
Really nice and clean. Of course they just built it and it opened on Monday so I would hope so. It is a grand opening so all the corporate guys are there handing out cookie samples and coupons for free breakfast sandwiches. Line moved really good. A little confusing when we first walked in but figured it out. That is what you get for just blindly getting in line behind someone. Not as mobbed as I was expecting given that it just opened. Got right to the front of the line and food came out pretty quick. We got our food to go, a coworker and I, and took it back to the office to enjoy it.
I will definitely be back at lunch time or dinner time. Chick Fil A is great.
Plus they get extra points for serving Coke Zero."}
{"text":"This location is fantastic- great staff, facilities, environment and of course, food is great! Brian, the owner, is awesome and cares deeply for his store, employees, and customers."}
{"text":"Greatest Chick-fil-A EVER!  They get really busy for lunch and such but it always feels like I'm in and out of there fast.  They have all kinds of sauce like all Chick-fil-As but this one has them all outside.  You could feel free to stock up and not feel weird asking for more sauce.  OK now this is the greatest part about this Chick-fil-A.  Are you ready for it?  It is the Chick-fil-A Guy.  This guy is awesome.  His greeting is awesome.  Makes the place seem so magical and whimsical.  You may be asking yourself \"how do I know I've been attended by the Chick-fil-A Guy?\" well trust me.  You'll Know!  I love you Chick-fil- A Guy!"}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite Chick Fil A to go to.Maybe because it's right across the street from work or maybe because the staff is so friendly (seriously, how can you not smile when someone says \"My pleasure\" in a sincere way?) There's always a line however it moves fast even with the lunch time rush. They take expired coupons so if you have one from a couple years ago, take it in and they will honor it! 

Around Christmas time, if you buy a $20 or $25 gift card, you get a free Chick Fil A calendar for the next year with coupons for each month. It's becoming a running joke in my family that I always ask for this for Christmas because it's such a great deal. They sometimes hand out samples of their milkshakes while you wait in line which is a nice gesture while you wait. Everything at Chick Fil A is bomb from their waffles fries to spicy chicken sandwich and they offer healthier alternatives such as their salads, wraps, fruit cups, etc. 

Be sure to check your receipt when you go because it may have a survey that you can do online in a minute or two and you get free code for one of their sandwiches or a drink. Eat mor chikin!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come at least once a week. Everyone there is so nice... Almost too nice. I have chuckled at the overly excited employees. Look...I know I'm amazing & it's a pleasure to serve me but tone it down a notch. Just kidding...I love friendly people & delicious Jesus chicken. I've actually had folks buy my meal a few times & I've returned the favor to the vehicle behind me. Sometimes kindness is contagious. And chicken...did I mention the chicken? Good good."}
{"text":"This is toddler heaven.   For about $20, I can feed a family of four with chicken that can be identified as actual chicken and not particle-chicken.  The staff at this location is young, courteous, and friendly.   It's highly family oriented at this location, you can pretty much bank on traffic in the play area every evening.    The facilities are kept reasonably clean; there's going to be a bit of a greasy feel sometimes no matter how much you do when there's 18 deep fryers going all day.

It seems like the fries are always a wee bit underdone, so we just get fruit which is better for us anyhow.  The chicken is always blistering hot, with the meat juicy and delicious.  Trading in the Veggie Tales cds in the kids' meal for a tiny ice cream cone is a no brainer every time.  

The only drawback to this Chick Fil A are the parents who don't monitor their children's activity in the play area.   I tend to end up being mother hen, demanding 11 year olds stop climbing on the outside of the equipment so that they don't fall and squash a 2 year old below.   

Overall, this place has saved me from making dinner once every couple weeks quite admirably."}
{"text":"This place definitely has its act together.  Whenever the lines get too long, employees are standing outside to take orders via an IPad to move along service quickly.  The staff is friendly and understanding.  Also, this place takes part in online ordering which is a great advantage if you want to get out quick.  The lines move along pretty quickly.  The reason I gave this place a four star review instead of five is the location.  It can get pretty busy and at times may cause traffic jams.  Other than that, I love this Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Fine!  I will praise the huge corporation with a positive review, they have earned it!  Today was my second visit and the place just does it right.  Very nice staff, so much so that it is surprising and seems out of place at a non sit down get a menu restaurant.  Of course it is being run by folks from the company at the moment but hopefully that will not change once those folks leave to open the next location.   The food is above average right above McDonalds/Wendys and right near Culvers.  But it is the service.  They way they treat employees must be pretty decent, it would be hard to be that pleasant if they underpaid, overworked.  Bottom line, it is a quality product served by better people."}
{"text":"We randomly went on a Tuesday evening and were surprised to see the cow and some activities for the kids going on. It was super fun for them and what stood out to me is just how the employees are always smiling. It says a lot about a company when the employees are happy to be at work. We even needed to trade out a kids meal prize and they were super nice about it. As usual, the food was good. My favorite treat is a cookies and cream milkshake."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum..... I wanna rub chick fil a's chicken all over my face! It's soooooooooo good! 

Get a number five. 12 piece... The 8 will not be enough. Yum. Honey as ur dipping sauce is amazing! The waffle fries are delightfully delicious. 

The lemonade is the best you have ever had! I'm scared that this location is so close to my house. 

This location is clean and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I can't express how bad this place is...  I just had $10 for a meal that shouldn't be served.  The chicken look strange and the fries looked as if they were cooked in old grease.  This location is owned and operated outside of the regular locations. Just all together strange..."}
{"text":"What can I say except I have soft spot for Chick-fil-A.   Perhaps it's their world-famous chicken sandwich. Or perhaps their hatred of the sacred cow.  Either way I like it.   I prefer the plain old number one sandwich combination, hold the pickle.   Also, their milkshakes are rather tasty.  However, their waffle fries could use some improvement, . as could their approach for filling up soda behind the counter. Other than that, I'm sorry Yelp, I'm giving a fast food restaurant four stars."}
{"text":"This is my local Chick-fil-A that I frequent 1-2 times a month. Today I tried something new besides the nuggets and wanted to share a real satisfying and reasonably priced meal.

My husband and I both got the Spicy Chicken sandwich with cheese meal deal. The deal includes a nice order of waffle fries and a drink. The two things I love about this meal deal is the unlimited amount of sweet tea I can drink and of course the way the food, no matter what you order here always comes out fresh looking and tastes pretty decent.

That was the case with our Spicy Chicken sandwich. The sandwich is not really spicy like what  I think is spicy. For me spicy is like eating Indian curry. Curry usually has spices. This sandwich is made for American food palettes and has a nice \"spice like,\" taste but it's not spicy at all.

Anyways, the sandwich tastes fresh because the lettuce, cheese, tomato and pickle are nicely stacked on this sandwich and there's no mayo. The waffle fries were hot, the sweet tea sweet and the service always good. This is a great place for a quick lunch.

All in all we left satisfied and got 2 meals for under $17.00. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Slowest Chic-fil-A ever. I didn't know there were any slow Chic-fil-A restaurants. The food is good. Don't come to this one if you're in a hurry. It's been this way for the nine months I've been working nearby. They just recently started giving out table markets so they can find you when your food is ready. They are making progress."}
{"text":"This place is overrated need improvement how to distribute or deliver the food for the customer, everyone is running around and asking is this your order . Feel bad for the employee and the portion is small need to retrain to get the food in the process that everyone will get it in timely manner that's all . Good luck!"}
{"text":"Robert S went over and beyond. He was very friendly and inviting and made a great impression on my first chick fil a experience. Thank you Robert!"}
{"text":"We live around the cornor from yhis spot and were frequent visitors until they started to get our order wrong EVERYTIME. Im not sure what is so confusing about plain biscuit, either they add chicken or forgot to put them in the bag and recently they have been giving me plain english muffins. I personally don't care for fast food but will make exception for their breakfasts, but not anymore. 

This location has a problem, to many teenagers not listening to what customers order."}
{"text":"As someone that grew up with Chick-fil-A, I'm so happy that we finally have two locations in Vegas! I've gone several times since they opened a few weeks ago. The food is consistently good, but I found the service a little lacking. I went in to pick up an order placed through their mobile app. There were at least 5 employees standing behind the counter doing absolutely nothing. Nobody acknowledged me when I walked in, and I had to interrupt their conversation after standing at the counter for about 2 minutes. I definitely expected more."}
{"text":"Hands down, just about the best fast food you can find. In fact, you'll leave here wondering why every fast food chain hasn't copied this model. The food tastes superior compared to all competitors. Why would you ever walk into a McDonald's again after eating here? The particular location serves up fast, friendly, courteous service and displays manners that are impressive. They actually made you feel at home in a fast food setting. 

Once of the things that I like about this place is the sides are interchangeable. Meaning if you want a spicy chicken sandwich (my favorite) you can order a salad to go with it instead of fries (and the salad is fresh greens and awesome dressing) or fruit. They cater to everyone - those who strive to be healthy and those who could care less. 

This place is ideal for kids and adults. There's a chicken option on the menu for everyone (whether it's fried, grilled or in a salad). When it comes to fast food, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Being from Texas I say I'm very happy there is finally a local store. 
My only complaint keeping me from 5 star, there always seems to be something missing from the individual items ordered.  The Cobb salad had no egg which is one of the things I love on a salad. The wrap came with no dressing (neither on the wrap or on the side, just nothing).  Every time its always been something similar - all there but still missing small from the order.  Everything else was excellent as always!"}
{"text":"First all, let me preface this review by saying that I DO NOT EAT FAST FOOD. EVER. I raised my kids not to either, but they become teenagers, and then they go off to college and they start eating what their friends eat!
Because of how they were raised, they are pickier than your average fast food patron, and my daughter especially had been telling me I needed to try Chick Fil A \"just once\".  
They opened one up in the Seattle area where we're from a couple of years ago, and I had been ignoring her for that entire time until we visited Scottsdale recently looking at property and were famished, and looking for a place to get a quick lunch. Not knowing the area at all, or where to eat, my daughter suggested Chick Fil A as she had seen some down there. We quickly found this one and went in to order lunch for our family of four. 

The first thing I noticed is that we were greeted by not one, but two employees when we walked in. We told the kid working it was my husbands and my first time there, but not our kids, and they wanted us to try it. Upon hearing this, he told us he would take care of us, and he sure did! They were awesome! Super friendly, helpful, and just plain nice in every way. The kid who helped us (can't remember his name) is a senior in HS and also has a brother that works there that we met, and the girl who helped us with our ice cream cones was great too. Very genuine, nice kids! And I must say, for fast food it was pretty tasty! All in all, it was a great experience, and someplace I (who never eats fast food) would visit again the next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast this morning. The chicken biscuit was so soft and delicious, and the hash browns had just the right amount of crisp to them! I was greeted very friendly upon walking in and I received my food in a very timely manner!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they've opened including their opening weekend and so far it's been excellent customer service. Their mobile app really helps kill the pathetic long wait time - not to give away my secret but honestly it does make it faster to get in and then out. 

My only real complaint so far would be the time I ordered a Large Milkshake and they gave me a Medium. I didn't bring it to their attention because I didn't have the time to wait but why charge an extra 40-50 cents if you aren't going to provide the larger size?

Other than you can't expect a brand new restaurant to be perfect. The police helped them out for a good solid 2 weeks I think and now they seem to have it down. Why else would people actually waste their time and money coming here for FAST food if it wasn't good?"}
{"text":"I love this location however the drive through lane always seems to be eight cars deep so I run in to dine or grab some yummy, Chick Fil A goodness to go. As always, the staff is friendly, accommodating and throwing out My pleasures like there is no tomorrow. I found out the other day they offer whole wheat bun options which is fabulous and I think it's only $.20 extra. They also offer you fruit instead of fries with your combo which is also fabulous however their waffle fries are one of the reasons I heart the Chick Fil A so fries it shall be forever! If you go to the condiment bar, they have pre-wrapped good quality mints (which I may or may not take a handful or two when I go in there). They also have free wifi---always a plus! 

Show me a carnivore who doesn't like Chick Fil A and I will show you a crackhead."}
{"text":"It's Chick-fil-A, how can you go wrong.  Very clean location and the food was good. The staff was accommodating and very friendly. I have never been to a Chick-fil-A that disappointed me."}
{"text":"Great service.  Quick and friendly. Order was correct and the sever was very friendly. The restaurant was spotless. I mean clean! This franchise is probably the best Chick-fil-A I have visited."}
{"text":"Come to this location about once per week. Staff is always friendly, great service and food. My personal favorite is the Spicy Chicken lunch with fries. It is even available for breakfast. Highly recommend 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Always good food, obviously. The app works better than any other restaurant app. They always have my order ready quickly."}
{"text":"How do u not have chicken ready?...drive thru took 30 min????...total bs never coming back"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on President's Day holiday on 02/20/17. I half expected it to be pretty busy since it was a long weekend but hopefully it was nothing like the Eastern one I've driven by countless times. 

This location is located about 2 miles north of the 215 Stephanie exit after Warm Springs. Parking for Chick Fil A itself, very minimal, especially since they blocked the area off for drive through directing and snaking of its line. But in comparison to the one on Eastern, this was nothing. I decided to park my car a little bit away in the larger parking lot northeast of Chick Fil A by I think TJ Maxx? and walk over. 

The drive thru line snaked out of the small parking lot, not even into the \"intersection\" just northwest of the building. Not bad considering Eastern snakes into Lowe's parking lot and looks like Snake Way (anyone get this reference? LOL). The walk-in line came out of the front doors and about half way towards the drive-thru. There was 1 person in the line taking orders electronically and they can pull it up at the register by first name, first initial of last name. The line went so fast that the girl just told me to go up to the cashier to order. I placed my order and got my food within like 2 minutes. They have you stand to the side at a standing table to wait for your order. A few people are designated to bring out the food to you. All in all, took about 15 minutes or so total. NOT BAD !! considering the holiday weekend ! Originally, the cashier only gave me 2 sauces. I asked the girl for some more and she got me 4 more ! Score ! I ordered 3 deluxe spicy sandwiches, 2 large waffle fries, and 6 piece chicken nuggets. 2 definitely was NOT enough. xD 

This is not the first time I've had Chick-Fil-A and probably wont be my last. I've had Chick-Fil-A twice at Atlanta International Airport twice, to and from Cancun during layover, once in Orlando International Airport, and once in Corona, CA. Most of the times, I've ordered the spicy deluxe sandwich, and once a spicy deluxe biscuit sandwich (breakfast time lol...) 

Since I was super hungry, I thought the chicken nuggets would be able to hold me off until I got home (about ~30 minute drive, clear on the other side of town). At first, I thought they forgot my order, but realized it was on the bottom, below the fries. Very tiny box. 6 pieces chicken nuggets, each about the size of a tater tot. TOTALLY unexpected on the size. As mentioned before, never ordered this before. In comparison to any other \"fast food place\", I was expecting it to actually be like, a \"normal\" nugget size. Guess not. It was good except it became more of a teaser than anything else. Ended up eating 1 of the 2 waffle fries orders on the way home T_T 

The spicy deluxe sandwich was much smaller than I had previously experienced before as well. I had remembered the sandwich I had gotten at any of the previous locations to be much bigger, especially the chicken size. That's one of the reasons why I had liked Chick-Fil-A so much in the past. Huge juicy chicken filet with a good amount of flavor and spice (uhh as much as a fast food place can give anyway... hehe). Large enough to have trouble going through the entire sandwich in one bite (hehe... oh boy... Lol) It was still good but a little disappointed at the size. 

Overall, unexpectedly, it wasn't the wait time or service, as I expected originally, to be the main point of this review, but the size of everything received. I mean its still good, but maybe won't go to the Vegas locations anymore, not for a while anyway..."}
{"text":"This was a definite first for me ~

    I stopped @ Chick~Fil~A drive thru on Eastern this afternoon. Such a pleasant experience!! The girl thru the speaker was nice & HELPFUL, then the next girl identified me by name, I paid her,  next stop food pick up. Very well coordinated, fast & convenient \"Isn't this what you want in a fast food, drive thru restaurant 
??

    My spicy chicken sandwich with the BBQ Ranch dressing, REALLY REALLY good. I would have never expected this. The chic cooked perfectly still moist & juicy, nice bun with some substance to it, pickles & lettuce.   

    Their \"famous\" waffle fries ~ well these were ok, they were a bit floppy, not crunchy. I should have asked for salt 

   Won't hesitate the next time someone's Chick~Fil!!!"}
{"text":"From Midwest where the lines for this chain are hours since there are only 4 or 5 (2 in my area)
Well I enjoyed no wait and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday  around 6:30 p.m. I Google'd the hours and it said until 10:00. It's not very well lit, and we were the only one's in the restaurant so wasn't sure if it was open. There was one guy further back behind the counter and he noticed us and came to the front.
He took our orders and said he would let us know when it was ready. I just had a chicken sandwich, it came out hot and fresh. The bun looked a little flat but other then that it tasted okay. My boys had chicken pieces with dip. 
I'm assuming this is a lunch time place, because it sure was dead in here tonight. There was just 3 other people that came in while we ate out dinner."}
{"text":"I gotta lotta love for Chick-Fil-A, we go way back. Our relationship is almost entirely to blame for my Freshman 15, thanks to the location of a CFA in the basement of my dorm. I could literally roll down the stairs and swipe my dining card for a sandwich in the morning and/or do the same on my way back in at night.  Moving to Vegas, without any CFA locations, was an adjustment. I'm happy to have them back for quality on-the-go grub.

The classic sandwich is my go-to,  their lightly-breaded, always-juicy chicken doesn't even need sauce. Nuggets are available for those who can't resist the allure of the Polynesian sauce. The grilled option is available if you need to make good choices, but it's nowhere near as good IMO. Waffle fries are always awesome, though.

The breakfast menu is still fairly new to me, and what I've been acquainting myself with at this new location. The grilled chicken English muffin sando is hearty, but I'd suggest adding some sort of hot sauce for more flavor to start your day. 

Service at CFA is comparable to In N Out- they set the standard for their industries by being attentive and polite, all the time. There's a smile on every face, tables are always cleaned, and the lines move fast. I'll happily EAT MOR CHIKIN now that Chick-Fil-A is back in my life!"}
{"text":"Chick fil a is one of the best fast food establishment you wanna check out if your thinking this is like KFC no your actually wrong think about eating a chicken pattie burger the chick fil a chicken is sold breaded not the deep friend Stop. If your a christian like me you will enjoy the friendly atmospher and the staff at both the strongsville and the montrose fairlawn location. 

   Don't forget to enjoy the christian music playing in the background."}
{"text":"I stopped by this location the other day and I ordered a 3 8piece chicken nuggets snack pack which I have gotten before they were so salty. This chick fil a is good but never had problems until now when we ordered a simple snack pack to go just to tie my self and another family member over until dinner 

   I have notified management and so far no response"}
{"text":"Great! Chick-fil-A in NC

Great service. Great food! And flowers on the tables - does it get any better? 

The service was friendly and patient - even with my craziness - they always seem to smile. The restaurant was clean and given we had arrived during the lunch hour everything was speedy."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMM IN MY TUM!

Amazing chicken and Lemonade!

Try the #5 12 piece. I know it sounds like a lot but believe me if you get the smaller portion you will wish you had the 12 piece."}
{"text":"The best quick to go fast food chicken sandwich.  Simple and good!"}
{"text":"Ooops, I did it again...And this time it was equally AWFUL. Why did I give it a second chance?"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast and awesome fresh homemade Biscuits and a must try but only served until 10:30am"}
{"text":"Alright, came back for the fourth time and I'm updating on how slow they got. I'm not surprised though, that for the first month they hustled and now their customer service has totally died down. Ignore my last review regarding their \"quick service\" and just know that it's probably going to be slow if the line reaches the door. Not to mention, on one of my previous visits here, they didnt ask me if I wanted any sauce so I left without any :( Tables have definitely turned on this visit, they don't look so enthusiasic as before. And I am currently writing this review while STILL waiting for my order for the passed 15 minutes. I guess I'm done ranting, the foods still good though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location! Always great food made perfectly (no soggy fries!!) Staff is very nice and accommodating! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Chick-Fil-A location, I go here 3-5 times a month for lunch. Always a very friendly staff and clean location. They are usually packed during lunch but I still am able to order and get my food very quickly. Food is great, one of the best chicken sandwich's around (none of that ground up mcnugget type crap) and their waffle fries are the best I've ever had. Their prices are a little higher than your average fast food (~$7-$9) but it's well worth it, you get what you pay for. They are not stingy with their sauces (their ranch is awesome btw). The only negative I can think of is trying to find a place to sit since they are always so busy. Overall great food, great employees, great atmosphere, definitely will continue going here."}
{"text":"I like Chick-Fil-A.  Let's use that as the starting point.  This is just a good company.  They're good to their help and to their customers.  They cook their chicken in peanut oil, healthier than McDonald's garbage. They close on Sundays giving everyone a day of rest. There's really nothing bad about this place, and this location is always clean and quick to please Johnny Customer.  I little advice, ask for a Chick-Fil-A sauce with your sandwich or strips.  Easily the best sauce for chicken strips out there.  It's not honey mustard, but it's similar.  Anyway, it's good times."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing staff that are so friendly every single time I go there! It is always fast and delicious"}
{"text":"It is just simply the best Chicken sandwich around.  Love the diet Lemonade, guilt free pleasure."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but amazing service at all Chic-fil-a's. This location is no different. Top notch service, friendly staff, clean restaurant and most of all tasty food cooked to perfection! I love Chic-fil-a!

I'd like to add that this location has an area inside for kids to play."}
{"text":"I was recently converted on my last visit  (just kidding). I am not sure about the creepy church-cult like music another reviewer mentioned? They are super friendly and treat people with respect. When I am in the mood for a great chicken sandwich, I head over to Chick-Fil-A."}
{"text":"This is one of the few fast food restaurants that I eat on a regular basis. Employees are clearly well-chosen and well-trained. They are always polite and efficient. The food is consistently good and well prepared and I have never had an order messed up even when I asked for something special.

Weekday lunch at this location requires that you be willing to wait in line. Everyone within a 5-mile radius generally eats here and it will eat up your our lunch if you go at noon. That is not because the staff is the problem, there's just more people than the location can handle. They have done everything they can to speed the process including posting employees outside with portable order devices.

During off-hours, the traffic is no more or less than any other location, and I will continue to eat here on a regular basis as long as I live in the area."}
{"text":"Every time we come to this location it's an awesome experience. Friendly staff, clean, perfect food, and it's always decorated super cute. They have family nights every week and the general manager truly cares about the customers! I can't say enough great things about this location! We  Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and the food is fresh and tasty. The food is very tasty and always fresh. It's very refreshing for a fast food chain. Did I mention that it's very clean at the Chandler store."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I lived in Memphis for 3 years, right around the corner from a Chick-fil-A.  So I LOVE me some Chick-fil-A, was super sad to move to a state without one, and was super excited to eat here while visiting my sister.  Thus, I am not exactly unbiased when it comes to my beloved chicken.

At 1:30pm on a Saturday, the place was mobbed.  I opted for the drive-thru, since at least I could wait in the comfort of my car, and carefully navigated entering the lane from the mall frontage road -- let's just say, some folks are not too good at this kind of thing, and it gets a little tight in there.  However, once the line split into two lanes, it was smooth sailing, and the order-taker was, if possible, even friendlier than I remember from Memphis.  She even took my name for the order, which was then confirmed at the pick-up window where my food was ready and waiting.  Most impressively, my order was exactly was I'd requested, down the sauce (they often forgot that in Memphis...), and my milkshake sans whipped cream and cherry (which I was asked when I ordered).

And the food, of course, was fabulous.  I'm embarrassed to admit how quickly I wolfed it down...  I've yet to encounter a better milkshake, my chicken strips were amazingly tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside, and the fries were...well, they were fine.  I dearly miss their short-lived sweet potato fries, and it would be the highlight of my year if they would bring them back, but alas, I think I'm out of luck on that one.

Thus, I'm happy to report that this outpost of Chick-fil-A more than lives up to its name.  Take it from a semi-Southerner, you've gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Customer service and food was great!! We sat down and within 5 minutes received our food. It was hot and the employees came around to make sure everything was okay. Working in customer service, I can definitely appreciate that. Great location. Clean atmosphere. Great food and friendly staff. Prices were reasonable. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Bad management. They are never present. Worst Chick-fil-A I have been to. Boycotting all Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Ok I think the only reason I am reviewing a fast-food joint is to get my review numbers higher ;)

With that said, this place was pretty darn good!

I have lived in AZ for 2 years now, and neither my boyfriend or I had gotten into a chik-fil-a. So after a long flight last night, we went through the drive-through for some quick dinner.

Wow! I was impressed! Quick, efficient, and very friendly service. All white chicken, cooked to perfection (who woulda thought?) and the fries were so much fun!! They gave us a ton of different sauces, and my boyfriend made fun ot me for telling them it was our \"first time\" eating there. 

We both got their GIANT chocolate shakes... I would have liked it to be a little bit more chocolate-y. Everything was good though. After the deluxe sandwich and fries, I couldn't even get halfway through the shake.

Would go again if I was craving fast food!"}
{"text":"Everyone is friendly at this Chick-fila-A. I would like to especially recognize Precious, Hope, Grace, (all sisters) and Abby are always joyful and friendly. They will put a smile on your face when you go. The owner is amazing also. Jesus loves you."}
{"text":"My wife and each ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and soft drink and shared an order of fries for lunch. The staff was extremely personable and professional. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a free sandwich due to my status as a veteran. (I was wearing my Vietnam veteran hat.)  a staff member brought our meals to our table.  The restaurant was spotless. The Christmas music playing in the background was appropriate for the time of year and felt right.  On our way out, we encountered some friends who were just coming in. It
appears that this Chick-fil-a is a popular place to eat."}
{"text":"This chik-fil-a is a magical one indeed. It has delicious chicken and great service!!!! My tummy was very happy after eating here. Two thumbs up. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"There is another Chick Fil A five minutes from my house, but I drive 15 min to this location because they have the most fun and friendly staff!  I always feel welcome when I come in. The food is fantastic! Chick Fil A has the best chicken nuggets, waffle fries and fresh lemonade!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Best fast food chicken nuggets.  Period.  

I love this place.  I've picked up food for the family from this location at least 2 dozen times, and they have never messed up my order.  On top of that, service is always speedy and friendly.

As far as fast food goes, it's tremendous!  Not sure how they make their chicken nuggets and patties (and probably don't want to know), but they always taste great.  Love their Ice Dream cups, also.

One minor complaint:  the fries are hit or miss in regards to seasoning.  Sometimes, they put salt on the fries.  Other times it tastes like no one did.  It's a little annoying.  But that's the only complaint I have.  I love this place.  One of our favorite options for family food pick-up night (Thursdays in our household)."}
{"text":"This is the worst location. I ordered large fries and they were half empty. I ordered a #1 with no pickle ame got pickle.  One of the managers was nice so I have it another try. I went thru the drive thru and there was a living black hair in my bag I realized it after I drive off and it wasn't mine.  I am fed up with this location and they do NOT deserve my business. They are very slack and honestly Wal-Mart has better customer service and we all know their customer service is poor!"}
{"text":"Manager here is SOOO nice she was all like you look absolutely beautiful when I was having a UGH day with a cap on due to not combing my hair and in sweats only to bring my little man to play in the play area while I eat a Kale Salad which is the most delicious salad in fastfood and it's a Superfood salad which is even more awesome. That awesome manager name is Kay Foxx by the way. She immediately and up with a smile and complimented my hat and after I said Thanks and smiled she went on to tell me how Beautiful I was :-) that was so sweet.

The play area here is pretty clean with sanitizing wipes outside the entry which is always stocked which is important with the many children in and out of the play area to assist in stopping by spread of germs.

The staff here are pretty friendly when on the clock, since I've been here a couple of times I know faces. I had an incident where I was entering behind some teenagers while caring my son and a bag and they rushed in and let the door swing to hit me not once but twice so two doors in a row as if I didn't exist. I politely reminded them that it was rude while they were hanging out at work and that they should reflect those positive smiles and chivalry into their daily life outside of work to have the best encounters as they grow."}
{"text":"We love Chick-fil-A in Ahwatukee. The staff is wonderful and as always the food is amazing."}
{"text":"One star only got the drive thru experience. Food was fine. I sat behind 3 cars that didn't move for awhile I pull up still 20 ft from the menu board and a kid asks as he's pushing a dirty menu into my car that gets handed to what hundreds of people a day?  Nasty. I no sooner look at the menu and they say can you pull up. Still 10 ft from board so I ask does this little handout have everything on it?  Well mostly is the response so I finally am able to pull up to the board and look. Same kid now 1.2 sec after I pull up asking what I want, save these kids it doesn't make it any quicker. Put one or two menus a little farther back like some of your competitors so we can see it before we get to the speaker"}
{"text":"I shamelessly love everything about Chick-fil-A. From the company's humble beginnings to their solid, no-apology morals, and especially how much they care about their customers and employees. The food is phenomenal. I hesitate to call it \"fast food,\" because it's of a far higher quality than what might be associated with that label. Everyone is always SO friendly -- not fake friendly, genuinely happy, giggly, bubbly friendly. We've never, ever been anything but 100% happy with them. Long live Chick-fil-A and kudos to the employees at this location. You're truly wonderful."}
{"text":"I mean really, who doesn't love a well-cooked piece of chicken, packed between vegetables, and in a bun. You have to love the idea that there is luxury in every bite, I mean it's a darn good sandwich.  

I live in Seattle, we have no Chick-Fil-A... we don't get to taste this wonderful delight, that make people line up in cars, bleeding into parking lot of the neighboring Office Depot, blocking traffic, and generally proving that if you are hungry, there is no good reason to go anywhere else, because you have it right here. 

Take the Deluxe Chick-Fil-A sandwich. 

The juicy chicken meat is cooked perfectly, in a light batter, and with cheese, lettuce, tomato... you can't best this simplicity, or the flavor; why would you want to go anywhere else for lunch.  You get some darn good waffle fries, and a soda.  Sure, it's not the healthiest thing out there, but sure beats any burger, in terms of what a good lunch seems, but it won't leave you moody or in a coma. 

Here's where we are, you want to be here, simple, because it's good tasting fast food."}
{"text":"Five for best fast food experience. Outstanding customer service. Better than most upscale restaurants. Most pleasant fast food experience you are likely to get. If you have small kids I have heard you can order at drive through,  then sit in restaurant and they will serve your food to you. Chicken is good. When the line dies down they come to your table to check on you and will bring you refills. Clean. They have a play room. Parking lot poorly designed. 
Will be back with the kids."}
{"text":"I usually rant and rave about Chic-fila but today I can't do the same. The drive thru service was not up to par. Clearly if I wanted to get out and go in I wouldn't have gone through drive thru. 4 items were left out of my bag and the cashier even repeated my order back to me. This frustrates me to no end."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed.  I Have raved Chick-fil-A  for so long and the last two times I have gone to the Chick-fil-A on N Dobson and ordered a market salad with NO cheese ( I am lactose intolerant) I get home ready to eat this awesome salad and find it filled with cheese.  Do we have to check our orders before we go?  Just last Saturday I ordered 3 salads to go and mine without cheese. He asked me, \"no blue cheese?\" I told him please no cheese at all. I watched him go explain the order when he submitted it which I thought was very smart.  But I got home and whala cheese!!!!!!
Sorry Chick-fil-A Riverview Mesa,AZ Don't think I'm going to take the chance again."}
{"text":"Why does it say your hours are 6:00am to 10:00pm and I here right now and it's 6:25 and you aren't open."}
{"text":"Just ate my first Spicy Chick-fil-A and guess what secret ingredient I found? 
a nasty long black hair!!
Don't think I can go back!"}
{"text":"Heard people talking about this place, we saw it on our way driving back to the hotel, made a hard right and into the drive thru.  We were looking for a quick bite and came away surprised and impressed.  Chicken was very flavorful and tender, the waffle fries were excellent, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Camelback strange. Great customer service. Always a smile. And the food. Lovett Lovett Lovett. Would highly recommend this to any connoisseur of chicken."}
{"text":"Really love Chick-fil-A!

We always get a couple chicken sandwiches and the Market Salad. The Market Salad is one of my favorites with fruit, nuts, and slices of warm grilled chicken. They also have soup, shakes, and waffle fries. 

Their counter service is quick. The employees are courteous and patient when waiting for you to decide. They give you a sign to take to your table, then bring your food to you when it is ready. They keep the line moving even when it's busy.

It's always very clean. Great place for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"My review for this location keeps disappearing  so I apologize if this is a repeat.   I go to quite a few Chik Fil A's.    They are all great except this one.  Corporate needs to come in and shut it down.   Give it to someone who cares.   Drive thru line over 30 minutes at lunch. Go inside only two registers open out of 4.     Cashiers could care less about your order.  No eye contact at all.  Ketchup is not at the normal place.   You must ask for it.  Who is that cheap to hide the ketchup?  The food is premade at lunch.   Chicken sandwich warm and sweaty.  Not hot.  Fries are old every time. Who is taking the fresh fries. My sandwich is always no pickles.  Can't stand pickles.  So what does this location do, they pull the pickles off the sandwich.   Don't they know the juice and pickles seeds are still there?????  Please fix this location!!!!    No pleasure at this Chik Fil A"}
{"text":"It is always kind of funny to write a review about a fast food restaurant with such a stellar reputation...BUT....this experience must be shared!   My daughter accidentally threw away her retainer in her napkin (Yes...I know...we always say NEVER wrap in a napkin).  The employees went thru the garbage can where we threw everything away...piece by piece.  We didn't find the retainer, so they then searched additional cans in the store (thinking perhaps it was swept up and tossed somewhere else).   The retainer wasn't located, but the manager even called later that evening to check in....We may be $150 in the hole for replacement retainer, but are all the richer knowing that this business and its employees truly go above and beyond!!!  :-)"}
{"text":"Cheated! Is how I would explain the quality of food and service. The manager must be telling the employees to pack the to go cups full of ice with a little bit of soda. Seriously you take 4 sips and your drink is almost gone. I ordered the 4 count chicken minis which I will admit is not a great value for the price but I do love the little yeast rolls and it fills me up. Not this time! I had to wait a few minutes for them to be ready which is never a good sign. The employee preparing it must of took his time picking out the tiniest pieces of chicken possible. It was the least amount of chicken I have ever seen and they are small already.
Most locations are the same to me. You know what to expect. But NOT this location. This place sucks. I will never give them anymore of my hard earned cash."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service and awesome ice cream. The lemonade is made fresh and you would love their fries well done."}
{"text":"Chik fila never disappoints. Despite the line, ordering and getting the food was fast. Bathrooms were clean too. I like that they have mints and hand sanitizer wipes."}
{"text":"Be aware, I got food poisoning from this location :( it came on very suddenly too, within a few hours. If you wanna puke on both ends, then come here, otherwise, stay away, farrrrrrr away!"}
{"text":"My family loves loves loves Chick-fil-a! Did I forget to mention that my family loves Chick-fil-A! This particular location seems to always be busy but, the staff nevertheless are quick, courteous and polite. The store itself is clean whenever I've dined inside. I usually go through the drive-through and even when the line is extremely long there will be a staff member taking orders outside to help things move quickly. I just tried the Diet lemonade and the only difference is they use Splenda to sweeten it. An extremely nice option when you're trying to limit your sugar intake. Take advice from the cows and eat more chicken ."}
{"text":"Always love me some good Chick fil A, and this location never disappoints. Their management team is awesome, and you can tell by all the happy employees around. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A food.  But this location left me wanting.  Arrived on Tuesday night and was the only person on line.  Paid at 8:21PM.  One sandwich--Spicy chicken with the multigrain bun.  Waited, waited, waited..  Young lady looking at her cell phone sharing that \"he called\" and constantly looking at the phone while I waited and waited.  Young people scrambling around doing this or that--anything but getting my sandwich.  Several times I was asked if I had ordered.  Finally I asked if food typically takes this long.  She said that they were getting me a fresh filet.  (As opposed to what??? an unfresh filet?  Aren't those things frozen anyway?)  Another young lady came by to ask if I wanted another type of sandwich.  No, I said, I want the spicy chicken sandwich. She offered me fries to eat while I waited.  She must have seen that I was famished.  Took me 19 minutes for one sandwich.  A sympathetic fellow customer who was watching my saga unfold, told me \"They can do better than this.  They are young but they can do better.  I hope you have a better rest of the evening\".  How thoughtful that this gentleman noticed and said something comforting.  In the words of that kind stranger:
Yes.  As young as the staff is:  You can do better."}
{"text":"Yes, Always good. Fresh,  hot and excellent service. I love the breakfast and lunch. I get extra food for next day too."}
{"text":"Pros: They can get you through a line fairly quickly and are always nice

Cons: Almost always mess something up with my order.  This is not an issue I have at most Chick-Fil-A's."}
{"text":"dont know what the deal is with CFA, but they are always nice, smiling, and seem to value your business. A+"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE... very professional... great people, always asked what condiments would you like.  Not like other places.."}
{"text":"I decided to try Chick-Fil-A because I've heard so much about it and people were waiting in line for an hour when it first opened. I have to say, the sauce is good. I think that's what makes it stand out. My favorites are Polynesian, Honey Mustard and Chick Fil A. I think everyone feels the same because they are strict with how many they give you. (That's why they lost one star) 

I like the chicken sandwich and waffles fries because I don't feel crappy after I eat it, like other fast food places. I know it's still fast food but it doesn't seem greasy like other places. The line is no longer an issue and they usually have people out front, making the ordering process faster. 

Make sure you download their app and scan it every time you visit. You can get a free item after so many visits."}
{"text":"Short drive thru line at 8pm on a Saturday. The cashiers take your order outside rather than through a speaker which is different...  they were all friendly and polite. We ordered fries & chicken tenders. The fries sucked, very bland. Chicken fingers were good, then again it is kinda hard to mess up chicken fingers. The highlight was the variety of sauces offered. I definitely think raising canes is 100000x better."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have never been to \"bad\" ChikfilA. They really have the formula for customer service and efficiency. I have rarely ever had any issues with my order but when I have they are prompt to fix it. I visit ChikfilA about twice a week to let you know how often I visit! The food is delicious; I can get dinner for breakfast (5-7minute wait at most); I usually order either a grilled chicken sandwich or a spicy chicken sandwich. The food always tastes fresh and they give me plenty of sauce for my fries!"}
{"text":"I LOVE anything chicken!! I've been a big fan of Chick-Fil-A since i was in high school. I LOVE their waffle fries with Polynesian sauce. This location has a speedy drive-thru with also a play area for little kids. Great place to take the family. Plus there's a Trader Joe's right next door, so moms can make a quick market stop. 

They offer grilled chicken options for those looking to keep lunch on the ''light'' side. 

I'm not from the south, but my guilty pleasure here is the SWEET TEA!!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty big chain so if you've been to one you know what they're all about. I like this one in particular because they have later hours, no annoying kids or families, and is newer on the inside. Bathrooms have keycodes which is a hassle--FYI the code is on your receipt. 

Lesser known fact about chick fil a is how awesome their breakast biscuit sandwiches are. Don't get anything with eggs, the eggs are no good (afterall, these people make it pretty well known that they think the chicken came first) but the spicy chicken breakfast sandwich especially with cheese, pickle, and chickfila sauce is what makes life good."}
{"text":"Just to note - our first time having Chick-Fil-A, no childhood memories are involved at all. 

Got to this location at 12:15 on a Wednesday and the line was out the door. We were leery but reviews said they move quickly so we ventured forth. It's true, they're very quick and also quite friendly. There were 2 employees taking orders from the line using tablets, then we just gave our name at the register to pay and get our sauces and drinks. We sat at a table and our food was brought to us shortly. I thought it was odd that they bagged it to go when we were dining in, but that didn't matter.

First note, hubby's lemonade - beyond tart. He grabbed some sugar packets to try to tone it down but it's a safe bet that we won't order that again. My Coke was fine, though slightly overfilled. It took a couple of napkins to clean up the overflow and I was glad that I didn't have to deal with that in my car.

The table wasn't cleaned before we sat down but it also wasn't completely gruesome. At that point in time, we just considered ourselves lucky to have even found an open table. It was cleaner when we left than when we arrived.

Now, the food. Hubby got the spicy original chicken sandwich with sriracha sauce and waffle fries. He ended up not using the sauce as the sandwich was exactly perfect on its spiciness and he didn't want to ruin it. The sandwich was a definite hit. The fries, sadly, were just average. Good potato flavor but not crunchy and it could have benefited from a bit more salt. Overall, he's a fan now.

I got the original chicken sandwich with the original Chick-Fil-A sauce and opted for the fruit cup instead of waffle fries. The sandwich was fantastic, tender and juicy chicken, seasoned nicely and not greasy. The sandwich only has pickles on it so I used the sauce which was slightly sweet and went well with the chicken. I was impressed with the fruit cup because it wasn't 90% melon like most fruit cups. In fact, there wasn't any melon, it was mostly apple pieces with some blueberries, strawberries, and mandarin oranges. The end result, I'm also a fan.

We'll happily eat at Chick-fil-a again but it probably won't be soon. None of their locations are in the NW so it's not exactly handy."}
{"text":"I don't eat much fast food, but an occasional trip to Chick-fil-A is a treat.  The chicken sandwich is the best in the business. As most people know here the service in this chain exceeds fast food and frankly many casual restaurants. The owner (Brian) is a good guy and does a lot in the community too.  We enjoy bringing the family by as we all enjoy it."}
{"text":"This might be a chain place, but man are they good.  I've eaten here multiple times and every time my food was fresh, the service was good and the atmosphere is perfect.  

If you need to eat quick on The Waterfront skip everything else down there and go here.

Make it before 10:30 AM for breakfast.  Best fast food breakfast in town."}
{"text":"This location is okay. I'm not sure why they felt the need to build a business on a tiny parcel of land, but that seems to be the trend. Food was good; service was good. That said, it's too small. I can't even imagine trying to navigate the parking lot or inside on a busy day. Will definitely drive to other locations when I want Chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive through for 45 minutes for breakfast & just as I pulled up to menu to @10:30am to order they changed the menu to lunch and refused to let me order breakfast. Manager/kitchen refused to let me order breakfast. I would understand if it was 10-15min later but literally 10:30am- great way to treat customers who waited in line for 45minutes."}
{"text":"Consistently the worse Chick-Fila I've been to. Not cheery and messes up my orders. Food is still good however."}
{"text":"Best Chick-fil-a. Always nice and willing to make my fries in the morning without complaining. Thanks!"}
{"text":"After running short on time trying to find a greasy spoon, it was decided we would hit the nearest Chick-fil-a to the Peoria Sports Complex before checking out batting practice before the Padres vs. Diamond backs game.

Walking in we were immediately greeted by the manager.  What a greeting it was!  I was saturated in salutations!

I must admit this was my second time at a CFA and the very sight of the menu was overwhelming.  I fear missing something.  This causes me to start left to right and up and down.  This makes me feel uncomfortable.  After all, it's all chicken......

I settled on a chicken, egg and cheese on a sunflower multigrain bagel.  I also ordered up a CFA Chicken Deluxe with some fries.  

Super friendly environment with some fresh chow.  Meal consumed and we were on to PSC.  If in a pinch again, we would not hesitate to visit this location."}
{"text":"Only fast food I eat ever. I've visited 100's this is by far the only Chic-fil-a I've ever had problems with the lady who took my order has the personality of a rock. Brought my food out I had 7 hash rounds OK I can deal with that. Open my biscuit if I had of thrown it the windows would have busted took it to the manager she took it back with out a word. How ever the lady whom brought it back out to me was super sweet waited for me to check it this time an apologized for the kitchens mistake. Please don't put a bad taste iny mouth for this business its the only food I can grab an go."}
{"text":"This location puts the \"fast\" in fast food! I went in the middle of lunch time & got through drive thru so fast it was unbelievable! Everything was right--the hot food was hot & the frozen lemonade was cold. The ladies & gentleman were kind & polite.  I love this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone. This is not my first time--every time is a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Good food, excellent customer service. This is rare in the fast food business. Came in on a Saturday afternoon, drive thru had quite a long line but surprisingly didn't take too long. They have a good ordering system and advises you who's car you're behind and all that, super organized. 

We ordered two meals. One original chicken sandwich meal and one chicken deluxe sandwich meal. We ordered some sauces too. After the drive thru, we passed by a girl at the sauce tent so we decided to get some more because I don't think we saw the sauces we ordered in our bag. 

We got home and realized we were missing one of the waffle fries! Because we don't live close, we didn't want to go back just for fries. We decided to call the store and the sweet lady told us to email them the receipt and just description of what happened. 

I got a response within a minute of apology from owner Dave, which I did not expect at all. I was very friendly in my email and simply wanted to inform them what happened, I didn't expect to get anything back in return. He asked for my address and was all in all super accommodating. I was very impressed!

If this business didn't care, they probably would've lost my business. But their high integrity makes me want to come back again and again! Well done Chick-Fil-A! Now open one in southwest!"}
{"text":"I am incredibly impressed with Chick-fil-A, and particularly with this location. The staff at this location is amazing! So helpful, fast and on top of it. Everything was clean and sticky free which can't be easy given the number of kids who eat there. Food tasted amazing and came out hot. My kids never want to leave and I never do either. I love the food and atmosphere. Perfect place for a relaxing and delicious lunch with my kids."}
{"text":"Love their waffle fries, it's the only reason I go there often.  Yummy food and great service.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"First CFA that I've been to that needs to enter a code to use the restrooms.  I guess location is one of the factor that they are needed as there are a lot of homeless people near the restaurant.

My favor item to purchase there is the waffle fries.  Their price is a little bit cheaper compare to other locations.  I guess location is the topic of this place.

Overall service was great.  However I don't quiet understand the entrance to this place.  Once you parked in their parking lot, you have to go all the way to the front of the store, entered on University Drive.  They also have drive-thru so you can get in and out within 5-10 minutes."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is the only fast food restaurant I like. It's been an easy staple when family from out of town visit because it's quick to pick up a tray that will feed multiple people for days, and the nuggets are always good. At this location, I was admonished by the cashier and manager behind him for not calling in 12 hours ahead and instead ordering this at the counter. Really? All those family get togethers in varying states and we've never had a problem. The wait for this type of order is generally 15-20 mins - which is no problem, but why be rude to your customer when you're going to fill the order anyway and it's a fairly typical request? Meh. Later the manager did ask if I was waiting, checked on the order, and offered me a drink. Good service recovery. Because I fundamentally disagree with the organization's intolerance of individual freedoms, I knocked off an extra star for good measure. Maybe that will assuage my guilt for coming here!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Chick-fil-A, and I have to say I was not impressed. I recognized that the establishment was full to the brim, but the service at the cashier and overall speed left something to be desired, and I found our orders were not called out when they were ready. 

The food itself was not as good as people had led me to believe, but since it's a fast food restaurant, that's more likely an issue with my own taste for Chick-fil-A than a problem with this particular franchise. The highlight of my meal was the Watermelon-Mint Lemonade, which was surprisingly refreshing. 

Overall, I have no interest in returning to Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"My first time eating here... Oh my goodness... why would anyone eat here food is gross.  worst chicken  ever, it was like rubber."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and kind. I went there about two weeks ago to satisfy my family's never ending cravings. For some reason my card got a security block on it so the transaction wasnt going through. The blonde girl at the desk was very kind and said it was on the house. I appreciate that. She didnt have to do that and she couldve gotten in trouble. I've gone here other times as well and my little brother got to participate in the lemonade making. Good food and kind staff I've always loved Chick Fil A :)"}
{"text":"Pros:

~Clean
~Tidy
~Fast and Friendly Service 
~Condiments are well stocked and staff readily gives you more when asked. 
~Food was Fresh and Warm.

(Pseudo) Cons:
~The \"parents\" who missed the memo that parenting is not ignoring your 10 & 12 year old \"kids\" behaving obnoxiously loud and disruptive to the Entire restaurant, but training them from a young age to be respectful of themselves and those around them. Training and Teaching are one in the same. Yes, I'm a parent; I have a very energetic 8 year old, whom I've been sole parenting, and his behavior was nipped in the bud as a toddler. At 18 months old, my son would start to tell other children, who were misbehaving in an obnoxious manner, to \"sit down!\" while at a restaurant. LOL! To this day, he is appalled at the \"culture\" of untrained/unparented (I know that's not a word) kids behaving like hooligans any time they step out of their homes. This is one of the many reasons I am a Huge Advocate for anyone who wants to become a parent, must go through the same stringent Home Study that Foster Parents and Adoptive Parents go through. Why are biological children not as important? Extreme measures via home studies are taken to ensure the safety of Foster and Adopted kids. 

*to the previous poster, complaining about getting a small amount of condiments for a small meal- every fast food restaurant is now strict about giving out condiments. This is part of keeping costs down for the business, and in turn, the customer. An industry standard (limited condiments) hardly constitutes a complaint and subsequent lower rating for an individual business within said industry."}
{"text":"I don't understand low ratings for a chick-fil-a. They make the same thing everywhere and it's consistantly the same and good. Love it. Never had stale food or unfriendly service."}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered #1. Drive thru is fast.
I had to give 4 star because I spent a little over $50 on drive thru and they didn't give me bar b q, mayo, or ketchup like I asked . I didn't want to g back in line or go inside."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location the other day for breakfast/lunch. We got there at 10:40 so just past the cut off time for breakfast. I believe someone was getting trained because when we got online 2 ladies were on one register but it took them a few minutes before they started to help us. 

Once you place your order usually they ask what sauces you would like. No one asked us that. We only had to wait about 5 minutes for our food and it was brought to our table. When our food was brought we then had to ask for sauces. One order asked for fruit instead of fries and our order was wrong. The staff fixed it quickly and we got to keep the extra fries!

As for the food, delicious!! You can never go wrong with Chick-fil-a. The only other issue with this store was that every booth we tried to find was dirty and we had to wipe off the table and booth before we sat down. The staff was very friendly and welcoming though!!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru. My boyfriend ordered 2 twelve pieces nuggets and 2 large fries and a cookie. We proceed to go through and I checked the receipt and said (before food came back out the window) I didn't order this. The girl with the braces at the window got the manager over, Spencer. Spencer said that the refund process was very complicated and long and that he couldn't do it tonight, but assured us the GM could do it tomorrow. He told me he could ONLY give me coupons to makeup for THEIR mistake.... (saying we had 2 12 pieces and 2 large fries when really they charged us for 4 12 pieces) I said no. I didn't want it the nuggets they charged us for. I didn't want anything else for that matter, i was disgusted. I work in food and how this was handled was ridiculous. So the next day, we call for the GM and talk to another guy. He heard us out and was a lot better than Spencer. Later, the GM called us and asked us what she could do after lots of hoops to jump through. We took her the receipt and are now waiting for our refund which takes NINE business days: Spencer seemed very irritated and inconvenienced and didn't give two shits about helping us. And then to top it all the food was cold and the cookie was so hard I didn't even eat it, just threw it in the bag.  The customer service here sucks and as soon as I get my refund, I'll never be back to this location, go to Canes right down the street, they actually have great customer service and care about their customers."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A but this is probably the first bad experience I've had. The customer service was okay but the food was so cold. It didn't even taste warm like it was sitting under a warmer.. it was just super cold. The fries were soggy and weird. Almost like they were a day old. I know they werent but it was so terrible. My chicken was cold and tough. I know it sounds over dramatic but they tasted like someone else's cold leftovers. Definitely below the standard of what I know Chick-fil-A to be. After waiting fifteen minutes for food I was too annoyed and hungry to ask for a new order so I threw it away and left."}
{"text":"Slowest chick-fil-A ever.  Food was fine but do not come here if you are in a hurry - especially over lunch during the week.  Was stuck in the drive thru for 15 minutes because it is a dual lane setup, which just slowed everything down even more."}
{"text":"Operator, PLEASE get your staff together! I live near your CFA and go out of my way to avoid your store and go to the ones in Ballantyne. I'm a huge CFA fan, frequent customer, and past employee of an ATL CFA and EVERY SINGE TIME I go through your drive through you mess up my order! CFA is about the details and this is wha sets it apart! So get the details right, empower your staff, and STOP acting like a crappy KFC! We know your store is old, but GET IT together!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Got our food before we even sat down. Everything's kept really clean. Second time we have been and we asked for the toddler book with the kids meal and they forgot. But this time we went back and asked."}
{"text":"This location has superb service and is very clean it was packed when we went but fast service and of course the food was great as always"}
{"text":"Chik Fil A always has great food with the best customer service, but earlier this week my car battery died right as the restaurant was closing. Every employee was quick to offer their help, thank you Kendra for the jumper cables!"}
{"text":"Compared to other Chick-fil-A's, this one is definitely above average.  Super nice folks and yummy food.  Yipee!"}
{"text":"Literally never coming back we waited in a 45 minute line to find out they only had a crappy breakfast menu. You couldn't even get their tenders only nuggets (which are the lowest form of processed meat anywhere). Don't come here anytime before the afternoon or you get stuck in a super long line that ends with a sub par breakfast menu.

PUT A SIGN OUT OR SOMETHING CHICK FLIA.
-One pissed off customer"}
{"text":"So happy that the wait is finally over. Went today around 11:00 and were in line for about 15 minutes. All the employees were very friendly and the customers seemed to be just as excited as we were for the first of many meals to come. Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, nuggets and 2 sandwiches for later. The whole experience was perfect."}
{"text":"They need to just stick with their chicken sandwiches and waffle fries.  Their coffee tasted horrible as there's no coffee taste at all."}
{"text":"Quick even when the queue is full! The staff is friendly and always willing to help. Always a great choice."}
{"text":"yes on the grilled chicken sandwich
yes on the chicken tenders
pass on the waffle fries- they aren't good, never seem hot, very dull in taste

it's a fast food chain- it's the best one around.  service here is quick and friendly everytime i go.  today i opted for the 4 piece chicken tenders with a side of honey mustard.  it came to $4.46.  i'm completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Always a wait but the service is great and though every Chick Fil A is fundamentally the same, this one is just a little better. Especially the biscuits in the morning!"}
{"text":"Alright so I don't go here that often especially for breakfast but when I do I'm always happy. The staff is always nice and courteous. They've never messed up my order and the food always tastes great to me. This morning I made sure I had enough time to make it to get breakfast before work. Madi took my order and was definitely a cheerful girl to talk to, really appreciate the friendly attitudes. But I got to the window and they're asking over and over again where they are. Finally ready, I open my box and the stuff was literally thrown in there. Sooo disappointing! I was real bummed to see what I was going to attempt to eat. That's my only rant because in the morning on the way to work, I have low patience. I would have gone back in had I not been on a time crunch. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Chik-Fil-A has the best customer service in the industry. I'm not sure how they find and keep their employees so positive and friendly, but they must be doing something right. If you're short on time at the Waterfront, this is your best bet. Don't forget their delicious milkshakes."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on with Chick fil A but my last two visits resulted in a chicken sandwich that was way overcooked, resulting in a rubbery, tough taste. That was the Woodlawn location. During my visit last night at the Arboretum location, I ordered the grilled nuggets. I've ordered these in the past so I am familiar with what they \"should\" taste like. The ones I got tasted like grilled paper. I had to spit most of them out. I think 2 of the 8 were actually edible. I hate to see Chick fil A go down the path of inconsistency like all the other fast food joints. It appears that is where they are heading. On the other hand, the fries were delicious."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much a wonderland. I go in about one a week and don't leave for hours. Normal when I come I get a couple number ones and a couple of orders of nuggets. Every time they are so fresh in my mouth."}
{"text":"Food is great, we've all had it it's delicious. I love there breakfast 
There customer service is 5 stars and they are wonderful."}
{"text":"We don't have fast food very often, but usually when we do we like to go to Chick Fil A.

Generally speaking, Chick Fil As are clean with polite, friendly employees and consistently good food. 

This location is the exception to that rule. 

The restaurant is constantly filthy in one way or another. It is still possibly a step up from some other fast food restaurants, but in the context of Chick Fil As standards, this one is completely sub par.

On one visit, I was standing in front of the counter while waiting for part of my order, and I noticed that my shoes were sticking to the floor. Initially I dismissed it and moved over, but found that I was STILL sticking to the floor. I looked down and found that there was a thick layer of sticky soda (movie theater floors x 1 million) that was now caked onto my shoes and causing me to stick to the floor even after I'd moved away from it. When I was finally able to catch an employee's attention to let them know, I was told \"oh, there's a leak, we know about it\" with no further action (no one came to clean it up, at least temporarily, during our entire visit to the restaurant) 

On another occasion, I went to get a child's booster seat and when I looked over the few seats available, found that each and every one of them was disgustingly caked with various food splattered all over them. I selected one that had the food mostly relegated to the edges and sides of the seat, and proceeded to grab several Purell packets to wipe it down myself. Several employees glanced at me during the process but weren't too terribly concerned apparently. 

On a regular basis, there are consistently a variety of smaller but still obnoxious ongoing issues, such as overfull trash cans and gross bathrooms. Additionally, a tiny thing that I've noticed (and appreciated) at other Chick Fil As is that when you get a highchair, they always always have a sticky placemat laid over the back of the highchair - this is so nice, because when your hands are full of a baby, your food, etc, it is great that they are anticipating your needs by having this readily available, and having it on the highchair means it is one less thing you have to grab. However, at this Chick Fil A, it is extremely rare for the placemat to be on the highchairs; you pretty much always have to stop and pick it up separately. Again, it is small, but it does make a difference and just shows that they don't care quite as much about their customers as all of the other locations.

The staff at this location is nice enough in the scheme of fast food places, but again, does not really live up to the standards that I've come to expect from Chick Fil A as a brand. They are your typical teenaged fast food employees; where I usually find that Chick Fil A employees are respectful, polite, conscientious, and engaging, these employees tend to be a bit more removed, more interested in joking around with other employees, and while they go through the motions of decent service, they're missing that little extra that makes such a huge difference at other locations. Additionally, I usually see quite a bit of management presence on the floor at other locations, but it seems much rarer here. I've also observed managers being pretty rude to employees once or twice - most recently a manager belligerently ordering someone in the kitchen to get \"some soup that is actually hot\" in a very sarcastic tone with very angry body language.

The food is generally pretty much the same as other Chick Fil As, but our order does seem to be messed up more often here than at other locations. We usually order our sandwiches without pickles, and this only actually gets done about 50% of the time. It isn't a huge deal, but does completely change the flavor of the sandwich to a more pickly flavor, which no one in our family cares for.

If we had a location even only slightly further away, we would definitely make the trek, but as we are quite far from the next closest restaurant, we end up here anytime we need something quick, and each time we regret spending our money with this particular restaurant since it is so disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant for weeks now. I was fortunate enough to dine in the restaurant this evening on its grand opening. A co-worker and I rushed to this Chick-Fil-A immediately after leaving work. The architecture is stunning throughout the interior as well as the exterior. We ordered the classic breaded chicken sandwich and each one was consistently delicious.  Aside from the delicious food and impressive building, I believe that it is the staff members that will bring success to this restaurant. I have never been to a fast-food restaurant where a staff member touches each table to ensure a premium dining experience. As we sat enjoying our dinner, a staff member by the name of Kevin stopped by our table to inquire how our food was tasting and if we needed anything. Kevin then arranged a tour of the kitchen for my friend and I. We were guided by an eager Chick-Fil-A employee named Ryan. He brought us on a trip through out Chick-Fil-A's interesting history and then elaborately explained the operation of Chick-Fil-A's kitchen. Kevin and Ryan made our visit memorable and I foresee weekly visits to this restaurant. Congratulations Chick-Fil-A on selecting such a hospitable group of employees."}
{"text":"Best service around!  Friendly staff and food is always fresh. Great theme nights for kids."}
{"text":"I'm not interested in writing a review on the food. If you don't know what a Chick-Fil-A has, or if you don't know about the quality of this fine chain, then go read my other reviews under the list \"Chick Fil A\". 

This one stands out from all the others. I've dined in once and it was a great experience, but the team that works at the Drive Thru window gets a five star review from me.

Sometimes, I get to the window and my food isn't ready, but the attendant is always so cheery, friendly and kind. They politely ask me to park my car in the lot, and then when my food is ready, they bring it out to me.

Once, I waited a few minutes, and to thank me for my patience, they brought out a small Coke for me. Even though, I typically drink diet, I am very appreciative of the kind gesture. 

This location really cares about their customers having a great experience.

Kudos Chick Fil A on 87th street!"}
{"text":"A fantastic Chick Fil A! I used to pop in to this location when I drove out to the Mayo Clinic for some treatments. 

Typically when I had to go up there, it wasn't for something pleasant, so a treat at CFA always made me feel better.

The staff is just as friendly as you would expect. Friendly, accommodating, and if you want some extra sauce, they are happy to oblige.

Food is consistent, just like any other location. I have still yet to have a horrible experience.

As far as fast food goes, CFA is one of the best. As far as locations go, this one is right where you want it to be. Very good."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A always seems to have some of the best costumer service anywhere in town. I recently came in here with my pops for a quick bite to eat and we were greeted the moment we walked into the door. The cashier was super patient with us, being that we had no idea what to order. He was so nice to use the entire time we were there. I wish I would have gotten his name and given him a compliment to his manager.

Our food was served to us very shortly after placing our order, which was almost troubling since I did not think they had time to make it properly, but it was fantastic. I would love to go here more often."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The food was great! Drive thru line moved really fast! Less crowded than the one on Stephanie. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I never have problems with Chic-Fil-A. Sometimes when they are swamped, they send the employees out to your car while you're waiting in line to show you the menu and take your order. A bit awkward when you're wearing your jammies, but still appreciated. 

I love their chicken club and honey roasted BBQ sauce. They never complain or state a limit on sauces, which is appreciated because my husband and I get different kinds. If I had kids, I bet they'd appreciate all of the events they do for family nights. 

The only thing I would suggest is that they fill their large fries more- sometimes I feel like I should just order the medium. 

Overall though great food (GREAT breakfast bagel) and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Including breakfast. Clean and well run with staff that seems to care about their customers."}
{"text":"If I could give this location negative stars, I would. I thought maybe things had gotten better since my last visit four months ago, but no. The manager doesn't give a crap about solving customer problems. When they completely messed up my order and I took it back, I was told repeatedly to \"take it back a minute\" and was then reminded of all the ways I was the reason my order was messed up. After listening to the crazy manager be defensive and fight with me about how they were not at fault, I took my stuff and walked out. I've worked my fair share of years in customer service, and maybe this manager hasn't heard the saying \"The customer is always right, and even if they're wrong, they're right\". 

I'll drive the extra 5 minutes and go to the Crossroads location. They are awesome there and even gave me 50% off on teacher appreciation week! Something San Tan never would have dreamed of doing. 

Forget this location. Worst Chick Fil A I've ever been too."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for the first time and see what the hype was all about! As I looked at the menu options, the choices consisted of Chicken Fingers and Nuggets, Salads Sandwiches and other items on the menu. I chose the Grilled Chicken Club sandwich combo. Needless to say, I was disappointed! The sandwich which was a bit dry to my liking. The waffle fries was decent. I had to ask for ketchup since I didn't see it at the condiments station. The employees comes around at every table and asks if everything is okay and if your drink needs a refill. They will go and refill it for you instead of you refilling it yourself. I don't see what the hype is about this place and why it's so busy is beyond me. I have had better!  I won't be coming back here anytime soon, I will just go either to PDQ or Canes."}
{"text":"Real White chicken. Waffle fries fun. Expensive for ckicken, but its not chicken parts. Love the fact it's closed Sundays!"}
{"text":"Good service.  They could work on keeping the tables a little more clean but better than most fast food places.  The playground is for 3 and under I think and it is pretty small but keeps my 2 year old entertained.  Definitely a nice place to stop by for breakfast.  I always think their chicken is on the salty side but every once in a while I like it."}
{"text":"Very busy store sitting on the corner of 16th St. & Camelback.  I believe it's a brand new store, at least it looked brand new to me.  Since the location is on the corner, it's very easy to get in and out.  I especially love their waffle fries and spicy chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food and best friendly customer service ever.  Very impressive with their attitude.  They closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"It's exactly what you expect.  Just much closer than it used to be.  It's just as good as I have gotten at the other locations I have been to.  We got spicy chicken sandwiches and market salads at 7:15 in the morning.  Unlike the other location in town only doing breakfast until 10:30.  The lines are moving along quickly.  Thanks for coming Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough kind words about this place. Beside having the best fast food chicken, the staff was so kind. Picked up our trash. Even offered to refill our cups for us. And this is at a mall!!

Kudos to the staff there. Great job guys"}
{"text":"If you've been to a chic filet then know what you are getting here. This is a great place to take small kids for lunch or dinner. They love the food and the indoor playground. Staff is super friendly and it's clean. Recommend as we go there once per week."}
{"text":"This location as well as pretty much every other Chick-fil-A has one of the best customer service you'll ever experience. The employees are usually younger, but are very polite and cheerful. The food comes out consistently good and fresh every time. Located on one of the busiest corners in the valley, you'll probably have a pretty noisy experience. They have plenty of shaded outdoor seating, but parking during its busiest times can get a little tricky especially when the drive-thru is slammed (which it usually is)."}
{"text":"We love this location. It's always very clean and the staff is always very friendly. People always complain that Chick-fil-a is overpriced fast food, but if you compare the quality of their food to other fast food joints, it's actually not overpriced at all. We eat at Chick-fil-a frequently because they offer healthy options and they make it supper easy to count our nutritional macros! Just because people are in a hurry, that doesn't mean we should have to compromise our nutrition and health for cheap fast food. Chick-fil-a is the best fast food option out there!"}
{"text":"Food here is as good as any Chick-Fil-A I've been too, but boy does this place get busy. I'm not sure if its the location or what, but a lot of times the kitchen staff just can't keep up. Delicious for lunch, but expect to wait a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"In my opinion one of the only \"quality\" fast food chains around. Delicious food quick and far more consistent offerings than your typical burger joint grab and go."}
{"text":"One of the only fast food places I'll frequent. The quality is excellent, the food is always delicious, and the prices are reasonable. Sometimes you just cant beat an original Chick-Fil-A sandwich, and the sweet tea is great too. Maybe try inside though, the drive through gets a little backed up (probably from being so close to the mall.)"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at any restaurant! Every time I use the app, I get a free treat offer!"}
{"text":"Had the breaded chicken sandwich, good for a fast food spot. I asked for no pickles but still got' em. Left a nasty taste in the bun.  Fries were good. Love the chick filet sauce. Great service, very friendly ladies at the drive thru. 

I recommend it if your in a rush."}
{"text":"Food is usually good. Service, on the other hand, is usually the worst I have ever seen in any Chick-fil-A. It's very convenient to my office, but I would rather drive 20 minutes out of my way to go to another location."}
{"text":"The food here is always on point and the customer service is fantastic! They people are so welcoming and kind and very respectful.  It looks like they have fun working so they enjoy their job which makes me want to come here!
I love the Cobb salad and the fries.. yum!"}
{"text":"Getting lunch from the Chic-fil-a drive through between the hours of 11:30am-1:00pm may prove to be problematic but not at this Chic-fil-a. There were two  employees outside taking orders and one runner who made this drive thru experience fly by! So next time you ride by here around lunch time and see a line of cars on the street, don't worry you're in good hands and you'll get hot fresh food!"}
{"text":"Aside from the parking lot being detoured around by HPD for traffic control and being somewhat of a \"cluster fornicate\", which is understandable considering they're new here and are getting swamped with people, it was every bit as fantastic as I remembered it from back east! Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff, and delicious food! Welcome to the valley!"}
{"text":"LOVE this location! 

It's always very clean. The staff is very pleasant and a huge bonus is that more often than not when you get your food order it's HOT!!!! How often now a day, can we say that for a fast food joint???

I love how the associates say \"my pleasure\" if you ask them for a refill or an additional packet of Chick-Fil-A sauce...

Last night I decided to have their spicy sandwich and a mini sundae. 

The sandwich was cooked perfectly...I don't know what they put in their batter but if I can ever get my hands on it....it would be heaven....and the spices were not too overpowering but added some nice flavor to a classic....do I think I'll never go back to the orginal...nope! But this is a good alternative! 

The mini sundae was so cute and for $.99 it will satisfy your sweet craving its their soft serve ice cream, hot fudge, whip cream and a cherry....YUMMY and its a mini so you cant really feel all that bad about eating it! :)

I love everything here...and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything for the first day opening ran so smooth granted drive thru was 35 min wait but friendliest employees and service was great"}
{"text":"Best fast food service I have ever received. Ricardo is a great dude who treated me well even though I unknowingly came last minute."}
{"text":"hands down one of the best 'fast food' spots.

Breaded and grilled chicken are both great, salads are some of the best as well.

It sits beside In N Out which is also crazy good.

Employees are some of the nicest and bathrooms are some of the cleanest.

Only downside is how packed it gets, the whole intersecition and mall is crazy crowded."}
{"text":"It's a Chick-fil-A restaurant.....just like all other Chick-Fil-A's it is clean, the staff is ultra friendly, \"it will be my pleasure sir\", and the food is always spot on. 

And just like any other Chick-Fil-A you will crave it the most on Sunday.

For those of you that are new to the planet Earth, all Chick-Fil-A's are closed on Sunday.


Bottom line......this one is just as good as any other one."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, this place is like any other Chick-fil-a.  I come here b'c the service is usually better than other fast food joints.  Today's occasion though, not so much.  I had just come from the doctor's office and wasn't \"all there\" so I was a little slow and stumbly getting my order together, I admit it.  The lady who took my order seemed so impatient and annoyed with me.  I even apologized as I ordered but no reaction from this woman.  I guess maybe she was having a bad day, too.  See, I can be understanding.  I don't know why she wasn't."}
{"text":"THIS IS SERVICE RELATED NOT FOOD RELATED. The food has always been great, however...

There is an alley entrance to the drive through that is connected to the CVS parking lot that is not the intended entrance. Usually I have no issues but today, Monday during lunch hour, there was one car in front of me and additionally two cars from the alley to the right trying to beat the lunch rush line. I know they aren't supposed to come from that direction but I let one of them in front of me to be nice and was going to go after. Instead my car almost got hit by the second car as he thought it was his turn even though neither one of them was in the actual line (think taking cuts). He started yelling in his car and throwing his arms and I was just appalled so I rolled down the window and told the employee taking orders what had happened. He just looked at me and said \"sorry\". At that point there was a huge line behind me, where they should be.

What should have happened is the employee should have been more aware of the situation and made sure the sign blocking the alley entrance was up and not tampered with. The two cars cutting in front of the rest of us should have not been allowed to pass though or at the very least been reprimanded. 

I left at this point and called the manager who confirmed that indeed people do like to move that sign and cut in front of everyone else at lunch time. She apologized but didn't offer anything else. I don't want free stuff but I do want the employees of a place I frequent to appreciate my business and make sure things like this don't happen. The employee taking orders was literally feet from where the sign is which means me was either being neglegant about an issue that obliviously happens frequently or he was doing his ASU buddies a favor by letting them in. Either way, not acceptable. 

They've lost my business forever."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received and it was cold food and all the employees were texting"}
{"text":"Great location.  This place is always busy no matter what time of the day it is.  Super friendly employees and all the managements are great.  Clean restrooms too."}
{"text":"This is our favorite chick fil a location!! Have always been a fan of this restaurant and this location seems to have the best service. It's always quick and our food is fresh no matter if it's busy or slow. The only down side is the parking/trying to get there because the parking lot layout is terrible!! But that's not chick fil a's fault."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chick-fil-A location. It's clean and pleasant. They obviously try to hire bright, energetic, conscientious employees. I've been here dozens of times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"so great to have gluten free options and staff was super friendly and helpful. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"A great place to bring the kids!  Chic-a-fill is all about chicken, great customer service and family!  Modestly priced and good food.  Had the chicken salad sanwhich on wheat bread.  Made with real mayo not miracle whip!  A 
Down home style taste just like my grandma made.  Tried their new lemon freeze.  Sweet but not tangy!  I love the mommy corner where there is a variety of items available for moms with babies.  Including wipes, diapers, Cheerios in a sealed cup, bibs and the like.  Also had a book corner for kids and an indoor play area with an attendant.  Hand sanitizer for kids to use before and after leaving play area.  Attendant wipes off all surfaces in the play area every 30 minutes.  This is a great place to bring your kid as it is so kid friendly!!"}
{"text":"Worst chick-fil-a of them all. My order is ALWAYS messed up in one way or another. The only reason I visit this location is because it is closest to my house and I love the food (when it is made correctly). Today, they really made me never want to come back. I had to ask the drive thru attendant two times for no pickles on my sandwiches, but I still ended up with pickles on both of them. To top it off, the left a nice surprise in one of my sandwiches.. a piece of a straw wrapper! Needless to say, I will be driving further just to avoid this shithole!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience- cashier made a comment about my boyfriend's weight. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here two days after this business opened . Even though it was busy we got our food quick and our order was perfect! Did wait like 3-5 minutes to sit at a table , but nothing horrible . Super happy and definitely will be returning !"}
{"text":"The food and service are excellent. Two complaints though. Most of their items are cooked in peanut oil. A death sentence for anyone with a peanut allergy and every item contains MSG.
Furthermore, the prices are quite high for the area the store is located in. I love the Cobb salad, unfortunately, I can get the same or similar salad at any of the other restaurants on the strip for less money.
I will visit Chick-fil-a on occasion but because of the prices, not often."}
{"text":"I was very impressed on how their grand opening was handled. 
One, there were like hundreds of workers working for the first week. 
Two, they had a good (but freaking long), organized assembly line going on. 
And three, they did little things to make things go smoothly and to their best, as fast as possible. 

You also just get a good vibe from everyone, especially being hectic, like they genuinely like working there, LOL! 
They've slowed down from opening week, no more police regulating the flow of things, but I would say still pretty busy!

Been here and the Eastern location a handful of times total. Once during lunch time (the longest I probably waited = 25 mins from ordering, waiting in line and waiting to get my food), twice during dinner times (both times waited maybe 10 mins and actually got to dine in once), then a third time wanting to try their breakfast items (maybe 10 mins even after ordering from the mobile app).

I've had Chick-fil-A a few years back in Cali but honestly don't remember much except that it was a chicken fast food place!
Soooo I needed to remind myself now that they are in Las Vegas.
Have tried the following menu items :
Chick-fil-A Deluxe Sandwich - perfectly breaded chicken breast, cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, in between buttery toasted buns.
Spicy Chick-fil-A Deluxe Sandwich - pretty much the same as the original CFA deluxe sandwich but spicy - it was good if you like spicy, but I for sure like the original better, just went with the sauces because you actually taste them!
Chick-fil-A Nuggets - pretty sorry size for nuggets if you ask me lol, kinda just looks like bits of the fried chicken that fell off the bigger pieces and decided to call them nuggets, taste fine but I rather have the sandwiches!
Waffle Potato Fries - THE best thing EVER - also because I love anything potato! It's the best when it's fresh - crispy on the outside, squishy on the inside! YUM!
Chick-fil-A Chicken Biscuit w/ American cheese - came with mini hash browns and a drink - moist, buttery biscuit, chicken isn't as big as the regular sandwiches (accommodates the biscuit), minus would be the hash browns I had were too well done, aka hard.
Fruit Cup - eh, you get some mandarins, blueberries, strawberries, red and green apples - not much to say.
Cookies and Cream Shake - so good and so creamy! 

I find it interesting that they have different things on their menu like grilled nuggets, wraps, bacon or eggwhite breakfast sandwiches, salads, chicken noodle or chicken tortilla soup, or chicken salad. 

Now, let's talk sauces! In my opinion these set them apart from other chicken places or what makes them original and different.
Total of seven sauces - you can have as much as you want and there is NO charge for sauces!
My favorites (in the order of most favorite to least) would be : Garlic & Herb Ranch Sauce, Zesty Buffalo Sauce, Chick-fil-A Sauce, Polynesian Sauce, Sweet & Spicy Sriracha Sauce, and Honey Mustard Sauce. Pretty much ALL but the barbeque sauce, lol!

CFA definitely satisfies my chicken needs (when it comes to sandwiches) but nothing crazy to camp over for to get CFA for a year :P"}
{"text":"Chick fil A is always tasty and the service is always friendly. This location is no exception! We didn't realize it would be so crowded (grand opening) when we showed up at lunchtime with three small kids but we easily found a table and my husband went quickly through a very long line to place our order. 

Employees saw me alone with three kids and brought coloring pages and crayons immediately. They treated my kids so kindly and the service was awesome. 

It was pouring rain when we left and they lent us umbrellas! Chik fil A always wins!"}
{"text":"The place is as busy as usual but the quality of the food has definitely gone down hill.  Arrived just after noon.   The food was cold.  You could tell the waffle frys had been setting a while - cold and tough.  This is the second time in the past month that we have come here and the food has not been up to their usual standard."}
{"text":"Whe I heard Chick-fil-a was coming to the area I was sooooo EXCITED!  I've had plenty of chicken sandwiches over the years, but hands down, this is thee best!  Especially when it comes to \"fast-food\" type establishments.  We waited for a week to avoid the hoopla...  it was STILL packed! The drive thru has EXTREMELY long lines. The lines outside are long as well, but they move very quickly. They had employees outside on tablets take your order, then come in and pay, and wait for your food. From the line to order pick up was about 10 minutes, not bad at all considering the quality of the meal.  You wait longer at DQ and the food can't compare!  If you've never tried Chick-fil-a it's an absolute must!!! Just remember they are closed on Sunday's.  This doesn't bother me at all. I'm happy in a world full of corporate greed the Patriarch of this great place has bucked the trend and followed his faith"}
{"text":"This is the second Chick-Fil-A I've been too and this one is super clean and nice.   The staff was really nice, fast and friendly.  They offered us multiple sauces with out us asking, came by and picked up our garbage and tray, and refilled my drink.  They do cook in refined peanut oil so if you or someone has a severe peanut allergy.  I have a mild one and it doesn't bother me at all.  They do have a kids play area and it seems really clean and fun for kids.   Like all other locations they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"There's not to much more I can say about Chick-Fil-A...you guys already know I'm a huge fan. 

So for this review I'm keeping this one short and simple:

It's new!
It's efficient!

And the food's delicious as always!!!

Nice job, guys!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A. A great place to stop by whether you're on a road trip or to stop by for lunch! I ordered the 8piece fried nugget meal, which comes with nuggets, waffle fries and a drink. Overall the meal was tasty and fresh. It was a bit hot, but still tasted good. The negative is that the nugget size is extremely small. About an inch to and inch and a half. Of course the taste of the nugget makes up for its size. Chick-fil-A is also pretty expensive especially compared to other fast food places. However the sauces are larger than the standard size which is perfect. Well, you should definitely stop by Chick-fil-A but be prepared to spend some cash."}
{"text":"This is a new location off of University and Mill Ave.  it has a spectacular outdoor seating area and cool indoor area with Sun Devil Pitchforks etched on the windows. The location is perfect. The establishment is clean and well maintained. The food is always fresh and delicious. This Chick-fil-a is on point like so many others. I love me some Chick-fil-a!"}
{"text":"I have heard the tales of Chick-fil-A.  I have seen the billboards and seen the commercials.  I have thought about driving (happy I saved the gas) from Vegas to Utah to see what the hype was about.  I figured after conducting a yelp reconnaissance since we were in the Phoenix area taking in the glory of Padre Spring Training, if we could visit a C-f-A we would.

Having consorted the yelp oracle and wanting to visit another restaurant in the immediate (relative) area.  It was an easy choice to visit this location even thought our bellies were full.  I needed this to bask in the light of the legend of the mystical chicken sandwich they provide.

Following the OnStar instructions we arrived. Negotiating the parking lot upon our arrival was easy enough as the lot was not filled to capacity as I had expected.  

With entry made, we stood a the counter and reflected on the menu.  I knew a sandwich was all I could stomach.  The GF ordered some strips and the Boy ordered up a Spicy version of the legendary sandwich.

The lady behind the counter seemed indifferent as we ordered.  Neither impressed this was our first time ordering or our 10th time.  The GF asked for a sampling of sauces and I am happy that she did....more on that later.

We stood by and the meal was on a tray inshore order.  We made our way to table and I observed a clean and tidy restaurant.

I unwrapped and bite into the illustrious chicken wedged between the bun and....was not immediately inspired by the taste. I tore open the bun to inspect it's geography and was not impressed even though I observed to pickle slices I had missed in the first bite.  After adding a contains of a container of Chick-fil-A sauce did I begin to enjoy my sandwich.

The GF fingers were a great combination of crunchy and moistness. 

The Boys sandwich was as uneventful as mine sans a little spice added to equation. 

It was an A-OK experience and with that we we were on the road."}
{"text":"Worst chick-fil-a ever. Been here 2 times and both were bad experiences. The first time we had to wait in a long, slow line and by the time we got to order, breakfast was over and they wouldn't honor it. The second time I had to pull off and wait for a chicken sandwich which is fine because at least it's fresh, but when the lady approached my car to give me the order, she shoved it in my window with no apology for the super long wait. When I got home, I discovered they gave us the honey mustard instead of honey roasted bbq sauce and only enough for half the order. I frequently go to the Arrowhead location and have never have a problem. Stay far away from this one!"}
{"text":"Chic fil a is always amazing after work... except for this location. Every time I go to this location my order is wrong and the sweet tea tastes like dirty water. Today was especially terrible! After sitting in the drive threw for 15 minutes, just to order, I got to the window and they did not have my order. Asked if I was someone else. Asked for what I ordered and had to re-ring the order in. After all this my order was wrong. I will drive the extra miles to go to the one in SC."}
{"text":"As fast food chicken goes, this is probably the best.   I have tried a lot items on their menu, my favorite is the chicken nuggets.  These nuggets are not just chicken  \"parts\".  These nuggets are real chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces,  with 8 or more sauces to choose from.  I like the honey mustard and buffalo sauce.  But the best nonfood item is the service.  
I usually go early in the day and I find the staff to be extremely friendly and they will go out of their way to make sure your order is correct and served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating at CFA, make sure you sign-up for their text message deals where you can get promotion deals throughout the years.  Their waffle fries are the best to go with their creamy ranch dressing or anything they have.  Best feeling in the world."}
{"text":"When I used to work near Dobson & Main in Mesa, I come here at least once a week for lunch.  I love their spicy chicken sandwich and the waffle fries.  I always upgrade to the biggest waffle fries size they have, because they are just THAT GOOD.

Everyone who works there are very polite.  Everytime you said thanks or thank you to them, they will always say \"My Pleasure\", it's like that's their saying, \"thanks for eating here and it's my pleasure to serve you\".  That's just great.  You don't hear many people say that anymore.

Stop by and try it if you have never had their food before.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the food here, especially their spicy chicken sandwich and the waffle fries.  Can't go wrong with each other."}
{"text":"Always come here to buy chicken. One day ordered my food and the power went out. They were so kind to refund my money and mailed me cards for food that day. The service here is truly exceptional"}
{"text":"First time and I wasn't impressed. Chicken is flavorless, dry and way too pricey. Will not return."}
{"text":"This is a really nice new location and if you like Chick-Fil-A then you should check it out. Especially if you live in Central Phoenix because there aren't many other locations nearby.

As for me though, I don't really get the appeal of Chick-Fil-A. Yes, the ads are funny, but basically its a chicken sandwich and quite honestly, the spicy chicken sandwich at Wendy's is better, as are the chicken sandwiches at Arby's or KFC.

However, if you're one of those people who loves Chick-Fil-A and doesn't mind fighting the crowds or waiting in line, then feel free to go there."}
{"text":"My daughters and I love Chick Fil A.  We probably only eat there a couple times a year though.  This location is closest to us, but I find that the service isn't always as good as some of the other locations around.  I've never had an issue with the food here, but I would not go there late in the evening because the service seems to be worse as the day goes on."}
{"text":"Today it was really bad at this restaurant, I'd order to go a salad instead of french fries with my combo sandwich and the salad was so old that I had to throw away half of it but in the end I throw all of it in the garbage. That is not nice Chick-fil-A that you sell spoilt salads to the customers!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, extremely clean and well-kept store, friendly staff, and great location make this one of my favorite places to eat. Their breakfast burrito is especially good, and filling. The spicy chicken breakfast bagel is excellent too!"}
{"text":"The staff at this Chick-fil-A are so pure and friendly that my soiled soul felt unworthy of their presence. A nice youth came to our table and offered to refill our drinks and provide sauces. Aside from the benevolence of Sauce Angel, I accidentally bumped into a worker and apologized... and they apologized back, you know... for being the victim of my large body slamming theirs. I love these guys. Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"I love  me some Chick-fil-a. Always hot and fresh with great  customer service. Thank for caring and taking the personal touch taking orders. Nothing like it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Chick fil A and the customer service they offer! All employees and manager go above and beyond to make sure you receive what you order! The good omg amazing I'm actually addicted! Must try!"}
{"text":"This Chick-Fil-A just opened on May 30 2013. I have found the service and quality of food to be excellent just like every Chick-Fil-A I visit. The employees here are very friendly and polite. The service is fast and efficient. The food tastes good. The place is sparkling clean. If you are looking for fast food in the Blakney area, this Chick-Fil-A would be the top pick in my opinion."}
{"text":"I waited two weeks to try this spot out because the first weeks were extremely busy! We came on a Tuesday at 5p and dined it, the line was quick we waited about 10 minutes if even that. I got the Chick fil a sandwich(#1) added pepper jack and waffle fries. I opted for the sweet and sour sriracha sauce and it was amazing! My sandwich was basic it didn't have much flavor and the bread was soggy. It tasted like a jack and a box sandwich which is very upsetting. We drove 20 minutes from summerlin to get here, and was disappointed. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice location with a clean and modern look and feel. Staff is friendly and your orders come out quick. Can't go wrong with this location. They have some of the cleanest play areas for the kids as well. The service is unparalleled!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, delicious! They have the freshest food, best service and are always willing to make you happy! I love this place! I always get the calendar cards each December and you get 12 months of free treats!"}
{"text":"BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!
I am in the customer service business and I was extremely impressed with this establishment!  It was my first time eating at this chain and I was blown away!  You don't quite expect a high level of customer service at a fast food restaurant but they have definitely set the bar at a high standard!  I went in with a take out order for 15 people. They went out of their way to make sure the order was correct, made sure I received everything and that I had a way to carry it all. They even went to the back to hunt down a box for me to carry the 15 drinks I had!! There was a line of 30 people behind me but they didn't make me feel rushed or that I was inconveniencing them like other fast food establishments make you feel. They made me feel as if I was the only customer in line and gave me their 100 percent focus!
Anyone that wants their employees to see what excellent customer service looks like should send them to eat here!!
I will definitely be eating here again and will recommend this place to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo happy I came here! I had to come on grand opening day and they had all staff on deck! I walked in and didn't even wait 10 minutes before I had my food in my hand! Wow! Talk about fast and efficient! I love it! Chik-fil-A has never let me down! Food was tip top as per usual, and the staff was absolutely lovely! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"First visit to chick Fil-a and no complains. Ordered a Chicken Deluxe Sandwich which had lettuce, tomatoes and dill pickle. Might go with the regular sandwich next time and top it with the mayo available at counter."}
{"text":"Happy to bring my kids here weekly. Love the friendly faces and great food.
So you can actually skip the toy in the kids meal and get ice cream instead. I never knew this before! Cool"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A. The best chicken fast food place out there. 

The spicy chicken and the chicken club are a must try here. My daughter loves the Chicken nuggets here, she always gets them. Make sure you get the Chick Fil A sauce to go with the chicken. Waffle fries are delicious here. The reason why I enjoy eating here is because it doesn't feel like fast food, makes me feel good after eating."}
{"text":"Love this Chick Fil A.  They are consistent with the food quality and the employees are always so friendly. Kiddos love the little play place and the balloons."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to chick fil a. I received a free coupon for a chicken biscuit via email. I order the biscuit. I showed the lady at the window my coupon an she told me to download it. ( I didn't know I had to do all this. I figured it was just a code she needed ). I did attempt to download the app but Before it finished the manager asked me to leave since I wasn't ready. I understand you want the line to flow but that's really the only option I was given. That's rude. To move up or ask if I wanted to pay cash Would have been okay. I will never go there again. I will make sure others don't go there."}
{"text":"Service is always great here. If order is wrong, they'll make it right. Very friendly staff and chicken is always hot and crispy!! Their buffalo sauce is my family's fave!! Closed on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Started waiting in the drive thru line at 6:30pm and got my food at 7:20. Order was wrong by one of the sandwiches but I don't even care everything there is delicious lol so glad chick fil a came to this town finally! Got my fix for now I'll be back once the hype calms down a little!"}
{"text":"She prepared my order after I explain to her that I have a coupon then she told me I should wait 15 minutes, and when I was at the window to pick it up she told me I can't get paper coupons.....??? Bad services"}
{"text":"I come by every Tuesday morning after my class and before I head over to work and I always order the chic fil a chicken sandwhich. But today I ordered two, for myself and a coworker so I went to the drive way and the lady said \"Its a lovely day this morning, how may I help you?\" and I replied, \"I'll have two chic fil a sandwhiches\". She then asked, \"The biscuit or the sandwhich?\" and I said \"The chic fil a sandwhiches\" and her response \"Alrighty then any sauces with that?\"- (she went through the list of sauces without me asking what they were) which was pretty nice of her to do and I said \"Yes, one chic fil a sauce and a polynesian\". She then told me what my total was and I went straight to the next window.

A guy stood there went over what I ordered and told me what my total was and I paid in cash. Hands me the bag of chic fil a sandwhiches and on my way I drove.

Halfway to my work I felt the bag and I just felt two chic fil a sandwhiches and napkins. When the traffic light was a red light, I took all what was inside the bag just with disbelief and you know what I didn't check? The sauces! It was too late for me to go back and my dumb butt didn't ask the time I paid just to make sure he put in those sauces in the bag. Ugh!

Told my coworker and he was like \"I can't believe they forgot the sauces!\" And I'm like I'm sorry too for not checking. But he said \"It's ok, I only have to kill you now\" Lol. It wasn't the same eating the chic fil a sandwhiches without the sauces!

Writing this review is quite funny. I just check the receipt too and the lady who I talked to in the driveway did add my sauces to my order but the next window where the guy re read my order forgot to put it in the bag. Ugh.

So next time you order something, park your car, check the bag for whatever's missing and if not enjoy your meal and the rest of your day"}
{"text":"Really great sweet tea and chicken sandwiches. The new sauce is sriracha sauce and it's good on ALL the things be it a sandwich or nuggets"}

{"text":"I've contacted corporate regarding my visit last week. There was a racist white girl that took our order and made remarks under her breath. (\"Ugh why do I have to take their order?\" We were the only Mexicans there)
Words are words and she obviously hates her minimum wage job so I was like whatever/ignored her. We ordered our meals and she gave didn't give us enough sauces for the amount of burgers we ordered - she acted like they were coming out of her paycheck - 3 sauces for 6 sandwiches  
Throughout the whole time are the register she had an attitude.
The food came out quick, they were all fine except my order. I had ordered a spicy chicken deluxe meal w/no tomato. 
I watched this girl leave the cash register and prepare our food. She grabbed a yellow slice of cheese (instead of Pepper jack cheese) and stuck it into my burger. 
I took it back to her and she stated \"oh my bad, that must've been cheese from the morning sandwiches!\" She turned around and laughed with coworkers. WTF. Petty much? 
The manager made everything right and apologized. Horrible customer service, avoid this place. I should've called the employee out for her stupid behavior, but God knows I would've lost my temper and she would have no teeth at the end of the night and I would've ended up getting arrested so ...?"}
{"text":"The service at this Chik Fil A is amazing. They do everything for you and they are FAST! They carried the drinks and the food to the table. They brought a high chair over, set up my son's placemat, refilled our drinks and threw away our trash. They don't miss a beat and the food is always super hot and tasty."}
{"text":"I am a transplant to Madison from Va and while I love living in Madison there are many things I miss from home.  Chick fil a is one of those things!  I was so excited when they opened one 5 min from my house!  Stopped by the day after their grand opening and was almost deterred by the crowd.  Convinced my husband to stick it out with me.  Surprisingly the massive line took no time to get through and I got my chick fil a!  This is the only fast food restaurant I ever eat at.  Love the food and they are always so friendly."}
{"text":"Aside from the obviously delicious chicken sandwiches and waffle fries I love to come to Chick-fil-a because they are just so dang polite. I say \"thank you\" as many times as I can just to hear them say \"my pleasure\"! 

My kids love their shakes more than any other ice cream treat anywhere! 

I also love that they are closed on Sundays (except when I want waffle fries on Sundays!) and their conservative stance and support for First Responders. I am a customer for life."}
{"text":"Love Chick-Fil-A

After I had my baby last fall the hospital brought in some disgusting excuse for food. 

I delivered at CRH right down the street from Chick-Fil-A and asked my husband to please go get me a chicken sandwich. 

I have been to Chick-Fil-A lots of times and it is always good, but let me tell you folks, it tastes about a bajillion time better if you have just delivered a 9 pound baby!

I love how everyone at this location is SO polite. Whenever you say thank you they respond, \"My pleasure.\"

I keep it simple. I like the plain chicken sandwich with pickles, waffle fries, and a diet Dr. Pepper. 

A total favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the employees are so nice. This a 5 star fast food joint for sure. Also it's super immaculate."}
{"text":"I completed the receipt survey about my recent drive-thru trip to this Chick-fil-a... and received absolutely no response from local or corporate Chick-fil-a management...

I ordered two sandwiches with NO pickles... I received two sandwiches WITH pickles. I tried to eat one of them after removing the pickles, but I couldn't get past the first bite of pickle-tasting nastiness.

I also ordered a LARGE portion of waffle fries... I received a HALF-EMPTY large container of COLD waffle fries.

What a waste of $12.90!

It's bad that I didn't receive the food I ordered and expected... but what's worse is the fact that I received absolutely no response after bringing the mistake to their attention. And because of that poor customer service recovery effort, I would not recommend this Chick-fil-a to anyone."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The owner or owners son is almost always there and customer service is great, even though at times the line is literally out the door. If you want to know how to run a successful business, spend some time here and just observe how it is done. The food is always good, prices reasonable and as I said the service will blow you away."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich was good. Not sure what all the fuss is about.
Five stars are for the staff. Hollee was very friendly, and brought my food out to me when it was ready (which didn't take long at all). The manager stopped by to make sure everything was OK, and offered me a water. When I was done eating, the woman in charge of keeping the dining room clean bussed my tray for me, then came back later to top off my iced coffee. Guessing this is why the place is so popular."}
{"text":"My little boy loves the play place its way cleaner than a McDonalds. The lovely lady doing the \"family night\" activity with my son was awesome, so caring. Thank you! Food tasted great!"}

Thank u for every supportive to this restaurant that make the chain bigger and give our kids the opportunity to eat good  clean fast food ."}
{"text":"It's always something at this place and it slow! No wheat bun, wrong order constantly. They don't pay attention to what you're requesting. Most of the employees at this location are young and careless. Oh did I mention how slow they are. It's always a line at this location. I usually avoid coming here if I can. Every time I try and give them a chance again they fail. Please do better your making the CFA name look really bad."}
{"text":"Maybe this guy was having a bad day but you don't bring that to work. The name on my receipt says autumn idk if that was this guys name. I have an A list card and he looks at me and says what do you want me to do with this.... pause and take a minute sir. I don't want to hand you my phone so please scan my card so I can get credit for this purchase. He was so rude not your normal Chick-fil-A experience smh! But thanks for the free mini today!"}
{"text":"Still wondering why they made 2 locations right next to each other?! But the chicken sandwich hype is real. First time trying both the regular and spicy and I am in love. So juicy and crispy!The strawberry lemonade is really good as well. The nuggets, however, are tasteless and dry and the fries are not crunchy enough. The sauces are amazing. 

It gets fairly busy here but you can order via the app to pick up. They also have a small kids play area here. Its nice that the employees bring your food to your table as well."}
{"text":"CFA is the cadillac of fast-food. They have great food and their service is off the charts in my opinion. They are so nice that it almost makes you feel guilty for having them help you. I guess this is what happens when you get used to other fast food places throwing sub-par food at you with a frown.

But really, get here. I love it. It is my pleasure to submit this review."}

{"text":"So this is my FIRSTHAND experience of this chicken place on Eastern Ave. -revised review #2-

Like everyone else I was soooo excited to check this place out and was going to wait till the crowds died down but since I was already in the area waiting for my new eyewear to be made nearby, perfect time to kill the hour of waiting. So trekked thru the parking lot, HPD ..yeah,
Henderson Police Department was in the parking lot directing traffic, no joke. For a chicken place. SMH.  I thanked them though cause they did stopped incoming traffic to let lil ol me walk across the parking lot.

Anyway stood in line, listened to people tell each other how they've had this stuff growin up, yada yada, and my story was the hype and the lovely rave reviews and pix of stacked chicken sandwiches is what drew me here.  I had this stuff before at their restaurant in the OC 
::  https://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?q=chik+fil+a&userid=2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg:: and wrote my stellar review about my CFA experience there. I wasnt impressed.

So maybe it was just me?.. Nope.

The staff took my order and I paid while waiting in line, got up to the counter and they had my bag already. Tore open the box and my mouth dropped, they were nuggets alright. Tiny lil things. 

Thought maybe they gave me the kids meal version. Nope.
 
Was I impressed this time? NOPE.

Guess I should've of known, those reviews I read glossed over the size, calling it \"perfect snack size\"  Again, I tried the chicken nuggets,  Ehh. Still tasted like plain ol chicken nuggets. I don't get the big deal of this processed fast food. 

Speaking of that, those waffle fries, they taste and feel like they're cooked in canola oil. IE flat, non greasy look. Ick. BTW those \"tasty\" chicken breasts and nuggets that y'all rave about are seasoned with MSG. Omgee double ick. That's just me. Not being preachy. But Im so much healthier w/o that stuff in my system.

Only thing good I liked about CFA here was the staff of 110 (yes that's what my server said, 110 that day) was super organized and all very cheerful. 

There's my firsthand account and my 2nd rewrite of this review. Hope it meets your standards. 

Oh yeah, like I originally wrote in my first review before it was removed,  for the love of God, reroute the entry point on Eastern Ave coming from St Rose already! While there's no huge line once you get into the parking lot, on the weekends it's backed up with out of town Chick Fil A'ers all the way to St Rose on Eastern Ave."}
{"text":"Loss of star because I really don't like their chicken. I know, gasp! I think it is flavorless and boring. So, why give it 4 stars?? The peppermint milkshakes are heavenly, their waffle fries are tasty and their customer service is out of this world!! I am not sure how they do their hiring, but it is consistently the best service out there!! Well done HR."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite chick Fil a in the city! It's new and the staff is so friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with the spicy deluxe chicken sandwich. Strawberry shake always goes well with the meal"}
{"text":"Meh. Complete meh. Employees are friendly, but that's the only saving grace. I mean, it is fast food after all, but I always feel like I should have just gone to Raising Cane's. Definitely a better value..."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I don't know what was better the warm perfectly cooked chicken tenders or the chick filet dipping sauce. Putting the two of them together was heavenly! The drive-through was quick and efficient even during a rush hour time around 5 o'clock p.m. on a work night.  I tried the strawberry lemonade shake type thing and it's very good with chunks of strawberry and very flavorful, perfectly mixed. I suggest you try it. 5 stars for this place."}
{"text":"Great food,Great customer service had a friend Say a witty remark and a staff member came from across the restaurant and ask if anything was the matter Great place over all."}
{"text":"I reached to them after I noticed my order was incorrect . The owner immediately reached out to me and asked me for my address a few days later I got a letter in the mail. Talk about great service! I wasn't expecting that at all! Everyone is so friendly and fast ! By far the best location !"}
{"text":"Have eaten from here 3 times in the last week.  Food was tremendous each time.  French fries are the best I've ever had.  Chicken strips are perfect to me.  Spicy chicken and original chicken sandwich are fantastic.  So glad they have arrived!  Drive thru was very fast with the long lines of customers.  Inside service was quick and friendly.  The restaurant itself is very attractive --- great colors and lines.  Nice going!"}
{"text":"This location do not meet Chick-fi-la standard.. I request a specific way I would like my order and I was denied. The reason was, per operator decide if they want to honor or prepare the request. Furthermore, the request that I made was for my chicken breast to be well done, but I was told per \"Operator at this location  will not make my chicken breast well done,\" the reason that was giving 
\"this would use up the grease quicker,\" quoted the person that was taking my order at the drive through , on March 24th 2018, @ 9:40pm location 13725 W Bell Rd Surprise, AZ  85374. I really think this was unfair to me as a paying customer to be denied. Don't go here..!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, I am IN LOVE with chick fil a! I don't even care that it's been open for a month now and the wait is still 30 minutes, I've gone there three times now in the last month and they have been nothing but nice, best costumer service, and high quality delicious food. Who cares about the wait when you get something so delicious at the end  the wait almost makes it taste that much better. Deluxe spicy chicken sandwich all the way. All their sauces are amazing and is what makes it really worth it. I get buffalo, ranch and chick fil a sauce. Their Polynesian sauce is good too! Probably going back soon now that I'm craving it after writing this review"}
{"text":"For a fast food place this one is a top pick to go to. It has everything chicken and tastes so good. I've eaten the Asian salad with honey sesame dressing, the chicken biscuit, the chicken egg & cheese on sunflower multigrain bagel, chick fil a deluxe chicken sandwich, their classic chicken sandwich. All of them were definitely meant to be how it is sold as. Crispy chicken and tender. Smells appetizing. 

I like that they have the drive thru lines alternating style so the orders can be taken as it comes and in queue. Except for one time that I went the employee had a hard time hearing me to the point that someone who came after me on the other line got their order first while I was still ordering mine! And the other customer was confused as to why I was still ordering and didn't move forward in the drive thru line. Ha! If she only knew.... :/

I wish they were open on Sundays but I respect the resting day! :)"}
{"text":"So far, so good.  As a Chick-fil-A fan, I had sent emails requesting a vegas location.  Been 3 times already.   Twice for a chicken biscuit and once for a sandwich and waffle fries.   Always hot and fresh.  Quick and friendly.  Yeah Chick-fil-A anytime I want!   I tried to go once at lunch and once at dinner and was still too slammed."}
{"text":"Our first time here!  Busy location,  but fast service with a smile. I'm not usually a chicken strip kinda gal,  but I've heard rave reviews. .they are very good tender and juicy and not like others processed strips.  Loved that i could get fresh fruit. That was very fresh as well.  Iced coffee was a great choice!   If you have kids and are forced into fast food. ..this is an excellent choice"}
{"text":"This review will be an amalgam of those posted before me, but it's mostly all written already, so whaddya gonna do?

Very clean, extremely friendly and the best fast food available. Some SoCal peeps would argue for In-N-Out, but that shite is overrated. As noted, the parking lot is a pain... don't park on the drive thru side unless you want to get stuck there.

one last thing, I have said in other reviews that politics does not affect where I do and do not shop. This rule applies here, but I will say I never really had interest in this place until hearing about it every day. Turned out the attention thrown their way earned them a new customer... for the food, not their perceived policies."}
{"text":"Always fun watching them direct traffic. Please Chick-fil-A stop building your stores on such little property. Parking is always an issue at any store. Thank God they have great food and great service. Bring back the lemon pie."}
{"text":"Can't remember the last time I ever experienced costumer service that was this amazing. The employees there are beyond caring and helpful. They made sure I was fully satisfied and they even brought my food and condiments to my table. I definitely left this restaurant with such positive vibes and energy. Thank you for your amazing service."}
{"text":"So my FIRSTHAND and also most recent experience(s) at CFA Henderson. --revised review #2--

Was I impressed? Heck NO.

Chicken Sandwich
The bun was the only thing that was good because it was toasted. Breaded chicken breast, seasoned with \"tasty\" spices like MSG. I took one bite and I was done. Wrapped it up and gave it for Mr. B.

BTW lately buns been soggy and soggy breading on chicken breast. Hopefully it'll be the last time I make a chicken run for my hun.

I did like the peppermint shake the other day when I picked up Mr B's lunch.

The Mobile App
Beware of people in line hatin on you.
Ordered via the CFA mobile app. I clicked on the button when we arrived, walked past all the people in line. The people by the door were blocking it and would not let me by because they ASSumed I was cutting in, so I squeezed myself in (I did say excuse me, but no one would not move)...and from feedback I got later from Mr B and my son, was the customers in line were talking $hit about how I cut through, that's why the guys waited by the door. They didn't want to deal with the wrath of the witches.

So I followed the directions stood at the table by the counter. As soon as I walked up there, an employee walked over to me and asked if I was Shirley. Yep, the one and only, I say. Asked if I need more sauces, hands me two bags, in less than 30 seconds BOOM, I was out the door, laughed and waved the bags in front of the guys and did a happy dance and said \"woo hoo!\" Cause I was happy the app worked perfectly. So 4 stars for the app. 3 stars for the food. Zero stars for the hangry witches in line.

You wanted my firsthand experience that was it."}
{"text":"I could never understand what all the fuss was about. It's fast food chicken, for cryin' out loud!Well, when the drive-thru wraps around the building and flows out onto the highway, that gets my attention.

Well, while in town on business, I must've ate here three times that week. I tried a variety of dishes -- chicken, salad, wraps -- each one of them was excellent! (The cookies are pretty good, too!)

Eat mor chik 'n! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to go to fast food but Chick Fil A is usually the one exception. I went through the drive thru and it was kind of a long line. They were taking orders before we got to the front to speed up the process. I got the nuggets and fries. The fries were cooked exceptionally. The nuggets did not have a lot of meat too it and it was a little too fried. Overall I would come back for just the fri"}
{"text":"We traveled to Scottsdale from Seattle. This was our first time at a Chick-fil-A. The employees here are professional and polite. We had several questions about the menu, and they were patient and helpful. They brought two chilled bottled waters even though we only ordered one. The water looked so good we asked if we could buy the other one and they gave it to us without charge. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. This location is clean and newer looking and open late enough that we could still get dinner when many other places were closed. It was a short 5-minute drive from our hotel, the Marriott McDowell Mountains."}
{"text":"No complains. I've been here too many times since they've opened and I'm always impressed with how polite they are. I really like that they seem very police friendly which speaks volumes of their company. I was there during their grand opening week and witnessed and employee taking lunch to one of the officers directing traffic. Why wouldn't I support kind people? Plus my kids love their chicken and milkshakes. Their salad is super tasty too. Everything I've had is delicious and just as good as I remember from my days back in Texas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I got my order taken by a lovely young lady, very cheerful. The food was absolutely spectacular. I've been coming to this one for awhile now and the waits were crazy but today I barely finished paying and my food was prepared. Spectacular!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try an after-concert snack and hoped the drive-thru line would be short, but it wasn't. Vegas is a good foodies community and every time a highly-publicized chain restaurant (ex. Cracker Barrel and Chick-fil-A) comes into town, there are lines. 

It's just franchised food, so my rating is based on my experiences with other CFA out-of-state locations (including one in Atlanta).  The building is new, clean and attractive, service was efficient, and our original chick-fil-A sandwiches were steaming hot with a large, tender piece of chicken. 

The drive-thru has two lanes with state of the art monitors. The line moved well enough and service was efficient (in fact, get your order ready before approaching the speaker because they do prompt you to quickly order to move that line along). Also, there is now adequate parking for diners who want to go into the dining room, but the development is still unfinished so that could change when the other businesses open."}
{"text":"I like Chick Fila, Until today. So last time I was here they screwed my order up and I didn't know until I got home. I called and talk to a manager who said the next time I came they would replace my order at no cost and she took my name and put in the system. She said all I had to do was give them my name and it would be there. I try to do that they refused and I paid for the order. It's not about the money. When you say you're going to do something you should do it. Not a happy customer. Not going back to this place again. You lost a customer today."}
{"text":"Whenever we can we go to Chick-fil-A -  We were visiting family in the area and got our \"fix\" at the local Chick-fil-A.   As always very good."}
{"text":"This is the only Chick-fil-a I go to in Vegas and I have always had the BEST experiences! And I have never complained about their (usually) amazing customer service. However, I went last week where they gave me the wrong order. Which I was happy to still eat but just called them to let them know of the mistake (as I am a manager myself and always appreciate being notified of any mistakes). The manager apologized and said they would give me the correct order next time free of charge. So appreciated! So, I visited again today and gave them my name. Not only did they mess up my order. AGAIN. But when I told them, they made me pay to fix it. As a manager, I would never make a customer pay for a mistake that was OUR fault. As a company they should make sure they not only fix their mistake the first time, but should never make a customer pay to be satisfied. Very disappointed in their management :/"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is my absolute favorite fast food spot. I frequent this location often and was heartbroken when I tried to go and saw they were closed for renovations. So you can imagine my joy when I realized they were back open a few weeks ago. Too bad they haven't quite nailed down an efficient way to get folks through the drive through. I think it's because they now have two ordering systems but haven't thought through how to make the entire process more efficient. Some other locations have some how worked out a system where, no matter how many cars are in line, they manage to take your order, take your money, hand you a receipt, and hand you your food without you barely even having to stop your car. (That's kind of an exaggeration, but you get my point.) Smh not this location! It took me almost fifteen minutes to get to through the last time I went. Then they had me pull around and wait at the front door for my food. FOR A SALAD. Utterly annoyed. I'll be back though, because the food. I just really need them to hammer out these kinks with the newly upgraded drive through."}
{"text":"Been here five times. I order the meal #2 which is a chicken slab on a nice bun with tomato slice and lettuce leaf, with waffle fries, on a plastic tray. I get a lemonade, the total runs about $7 with tax. I think this is a little on the high side for fast food.

The service has always been fast, the eating area is always clean, the chicken is always really nice. And the sauce pack you sometimes get with the sandwich is a nice touch.

I have two complaints about this place. 1. The temp of my fries has always been slightly warmer than room temperature. 2. Ketchup packs - takes more time to open and empty them than it takes to consume that tiny amount of ketchup. I want a ketchup pump like In & Out or Wendy's.

This place is also a magnet for moms with little kids, kids that have not yet developed volume control. So at lunch time it tends to get loud with screaming or yelling kids. 

 This place is not open on sundays.  If you've never been to this chain before, check out their menus online first. I understand this is one of the healthier fast food places in the USA.

I think next time I go here I will bring my own bottle of ketchup and some ear plugs. Better yet, take home and nuke the fries and use my own ketchup.

Update: Since their promotional stunt standing out against gay marriage I have never returned. I'm not gay but I have coworkers and friend who are. I will never again eat this or any other chain that promotes hatred."}
{"text":"Our family loves this Chik fil A! It's so family friendly. I was super impressed with the emphasis on family time. The have family board games you can use during your visit which makes for a complete family night out. The staff is always friendly and the food is great !"}
{"text":"Excellent service, albeit young! Always ready to serve you and they don't make you rush at the counter or drive thru. They won't hesitate to give you sauces our complimentary refills.

One of the only ones nearby and deserves a 5-star rating after every visit."}
{"text":"The only thing I can ever really fault this location is that it is too good, and therefore always busy. I've heard that this is one of the busiest if not the busiest location in NC and I definitely believe it. The employees are always polite even when the line insane they still have smiles on their faces. The food is always hot and comes out quickly. 

Don't forget you can trade your kids meal toy for an ice cream cone!"}
{"text":"I usually meet my friends here for lunch as it is a good midpoint between uptown and South Charlotte. Parking can be a little tricky for this area, but I've always found a spot, somewhere close.

The line inside is always pretty quick, and there are an abundance of children during lunch time, as there is a pretty good play place attached. If you don't like children, I suggest going somewhere else. 

The servers are nice and the food is good, what I've come to expect from a Chick Fil A, and have never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus. All my prayers have been answered. CFA has finally come to Vegas! No more driving to Cali or Utah for my fix. And just when you thought nothing could top that...they're now open on Sundays. JUST KIDDING!! But we do have another location that recently opened as well (located on Stephanie St). Two is always better than one, am I right? 

First and foremost, the customer service is top notch. You'll never find better service at a fast food restaurant. The friendliest staff. Courteous, helpful, efficient and not once has my order ever been wrong. Unheard of right? They bring the food to your table and even check to see if you need any sauces, napkins, wet naps, anything to make your experience an enjoyable one. 

And the food...where do I begin? Spicy Chicken Deluxe has always been my all time favorite. Other top faves: Chicken Salad Sandwich, Grilled Cool Wrap and the Chicken Nuggets or Tenders. Not a huge fan of breakfast here. But no biggie, I can wait for lunch :) And be sure to try the sauces. It's not like McDonald's where they nickel and dime you for those. You can get as many as you like. If you can't decide, ask for one of each. They are more than happy to oblige. My personal fave: Sweet & Spicy Sriracha, Polynesian, CFA, and Honey Mustard. 

Thank you Chick-Fil-A for coming to Las Vegas and reminding us to Eat Mor Chikin!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They always mess up my order...  every time I get a salad it's wrong!  I order lemonade, it's diet.  Getting old.  My Salas today is missing the sides."}
{"text":"I love Chik Fil A and usually this location is amazing. I usually hit the drive thru but this morning decided to go in and have breakfast inside. I placed my order at 10AM and didn't receive my food until 10:17AM.... oh and all we ordered was a cup of fruit and a bacon bagel sandwich. Probably wouldn't dine in if you have anything you want to do the rest of the day."}
{"text":"It's no secret I'm a Chick Fil A fanatic!

I've reviewed plenty of these and always have the same thing to say. I'm totally a FAN! 

For two simple reasons: 

1. I think one of the best qualities about Chick Fil A is that they set a different standard for \"fast food\" service. Most of the locations I've visited have extremely friendly employees and best customer service around. Everything from an extra packet of ketchup to getting your sandwich \"well done\" (for all the extra crispy lovers this is an absolute must!) is always accommodated with a kind \"my pleasure\". I wish ordering everywhere else was so freaking easy and nice! Pure awesomeness.

2. They just have darn good food.

Well, this location did not disappoint. I can only review the drive thru but it was spot on. I ordered my food, the staff was pleasant and my order was hot and correct! 

But I agree with previous reviews getting out of this location is a bit of a pain. But hey, I'll just enjoy my waffle fries and sip my lemonade until I make it out."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Chick Fil A?!! Every time I visit this location it's a pleasant experience.

My food is always hot and prepared as I order it. Any request, they reply with \"my pleasure\" and even walk the food to you from behind the counter. 

This location offers some of the best customer service I've experience from a \"fast food\" joint in a long time. And that's why I feel it more than deserves the 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A never disappoints as far as fast food is concerned with me!  This location has by far the BEST customer service that I've ever had and it's consistent...every, single time!!!  Met my sister with a few of the children that I watch today for lunch and they were so attentive and brought our food to the table for us, put down place mats for the kids (which I LOVE) and refilled our drinks too!  When the kids traded their toys for ice cream (their favorite part of CFA) they were greeted at the counter (by the manager I think) and got to 'order' their own which they loved!  

I don't think I've ever really had a bad experience with Chick-Fil-A anywhere, but this one rocked it today and I thought it warranted a Yelp review!  Great customer service goes a long way in my opinion whether it's a $25 a person meal or fast food - and it's great to see people who actually look like they enjoy their jobs too!

Very, very pleased with my experience today and we'll definitely visit this location again (and again) !"}
{"text":"Love Chickfila! Of course most folks have tried it once if not more in their life...but I just can't let this trip go without recognition...We went for breakfast, ordered a combo meal and a four pack of Chicken Minis. Friendliest help at the window asking how we were, if we need condiments and telling us to have a great day.  In our bag we had plentiful napkins, sanitizing hand wipes and mints AND a card annoucing another round of 'reserve your free breakfast that is coming up...just because that's how they are!  SO refreshing to have good customer service that is consistent and feels genuine!"}
{"text":"I am always a fan of Chickfila.  Never so much a fan of the parking lots where you have to circle the building to exit?!? Is it a requirement of Chickfila to have hard to navigate parking areas??? 

In all seriousness...Number one, no pickles, sweet tea....ahhhh....perfection!"}
{"text":"Love this location. So well managed and always a delight to go here. I downloaded the app and it is super slick. Choose what i want, choose curbside deliver, when i arrive park in a spot and let them know I am there via the app. They walk the good right out to my car. Amazing. 

Food is always great. It's chicken. Good chicken. 

I am a fan of ditching the pickles and adding tomato and lettuce."}
{"text":"My first day back enjoying this restaurant     now they have decided to remove themselves from the intimate relationships of Americans.

The store was clean, employees were efficient and pleasant. What a great experience."}
{"text":"Who does not love aChick-fil-A sandwich? Finally we have it in Las Vegas and this Henderson location. 

Fresh made and with extra friendly service. You cannot do wrong here !"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the parking lot situation is crazy. The have the lot coned off and the first entrance from Eastern is blocked off. When you try to leave they force you out on to Eastern heading southbound. I need to go to the light and head northbound on Eastern.  I didn't know this place was in charge of traffic too! This is ridiculous. I won't be back until the newness wears off and I can actually go through the drive thru without spending $10 in extra gas to do so."}
{"text":"Such a horrible morning crew, I called in to place a phone order being that the mobile app wasn't working. The girl that answered put me on hold then a man came on the phone and proceed to take my phone order he never asked for a name didn't ask if i wanted the sandwiches as meals Which I Did!! I had to tell him \"so do i get drinks with the meals\" and he said \"oh ok\" then was gonna hang up without me telling him the drinks. I then call back 15min later to make sure it would be ready because i only get 30min for lunch. They assured me that it was being worked on and would be ready. I get there and they ask for a name i tell them they never asked for a name then they were gonna start my order right then. I told them im gonna be late if i wait so i left. So now not only did i waste gas, time, and effort i still didn't get anything to eat and have to go work another 5 hours. Will never go there again. My co-workers warned me!!!! If you want inaccurate service and being lied to then go to this location.
Very disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"The menu selection is different from other locations. Service is slow. Food doesn't even taste the same. Corporate definitely dropped the ball here. Some assistance from their southern counterpart is definitely needed."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Chic Fil A for over 9 years from California to Georgia and this location is lacking in the quality of the chic mini boxes...The bread was doughy and not brown at all. The chicken was super small and was not warm or fresh as if it had been sitting there all morning. The hash browns are not brown or warm. The lemonade needs to be diluted. It was so sweet I couldn't get it down. I am truly disappointed in the quality of this new location.. Please get it together..This is so close to home I would love to continue to enjoy it. Since something is happening with the recipe of Chic Fil A and these new franchises are lacking...I'm thinking I will take my business to Canes where the quality of the chicken is consistent every single visit!!! Signed a VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER OF OVER 9 YEARS!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. For a fast food restaurant, they are second to none. They always have a cheery attitude and they serve the food to you at your table. They have family nights once a month and they treat their customers with the utmost respect. The food is excellent for being fast food and is a value for the price."}
{"text":"You are greeted as soon as you walk in by a very friendly staff. Food was excellent, ordered the fried chicken sandwich platter with a tasty lemonade.

Manager came around all the tables offering free refills. You can't beat that. 

Glad I stopped in, great lunch on Tuesday!"}
{"text":"When to Grab breakfast as I do everyday. Get to work open my box and it appears that my food looks trampled and thrown away.

Not what I expect from Chick-Fil-a.  This is probably some of the worst looking breakfast I have had in awhile."}
{"text":"Avoid ordering anything containing lettuce in it from this place because you will be served with some rotten ones and the manager Cornell Watts could care less.  You just will be stared down with a dirty look like you want to take advantage of them or something when you showed them the rotten parts after consumed some (didn't realized you have to check all the parts of the sandwich before eating, guess my own fault).  No apology or anything from him.  Very bad customer service from this place.  Not what I expect from chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Also love using the app to skip the line.  The Cobb salad in particular is awesome- plenty of chicken and good fresh toppings. So many salads you get uptown skimp on the chicken but these are great."}
{"text":"Tried the grilled nuggets for the first time and they were awful! Tasted nothing like their other chicken. Also had fries which were good but felt sick after I ate there. Will not go back"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service of this Chick-Fil-A. Last week I was given the incorrect drink. They also have forgotten the salsa that goes with the breakfast burrito before. Today, I had ordered a chicken biscuit, along with food for a few other people. Although I paid for it, they didn't give me my chicken biscuit only the hashbrowns. 

On various occasions the cashiers have been rude or had an attitude. I expect much better from Chick-Fil-A and must say I am throughly disappointed."}
{"text":"I'd never paid too much attention to Chickfila, I always figured: what's the big deal, I can get a chicken sandwich at any fast food joint, what do you mean they don't serve burgers?  I also live close by a new location that was built on the site of a flourishing Popeye's Chicken.  A Popeye's Chicken I regularly frequented and now gone at the hand of Chickfila.  So I was never really a fan, I guess;  Until now.  While in the Cleveland, OH area on business, I was referred to this joint because they had free wifi and I could eat and get some work done.   Upon arriving, I immediately noticed the freshness and tasteful appearance of the restaurant, staff and facility.  After advising the counter guy that I was a rookie and didn't really know my way around the menu or nomenclature of the combo meals, he was quick to help and offer suggestion.  I settled with the spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries.  The first sign that the culture was a little different here was that the counter attendant offered to bring my tray out to my table instead of have me stand there and wait, like a cow at the grain trough.  My tray was brought to the table like a real restaurant and the food was awesome and maybe even a notch above fast food fare.  The counter guy, now server, also brought along some of their special sauce which was a delightful recommendation.  After eating I stayed longer to sponge off the free wifi.  I generally try to do this on off peak hours because  I always feel I am imposing by occupying a table for longer than a normal meal consumption.  The server soon returned and this time brought me a soft serve ice cream cone: \"on the house\" because I was a first time visitor.  WOW, I had just been WOWED at a fast food joint, awesome.   This employee is management material Chickfila.  Now, not only was I a satisfied customer but now I am a loyal customer, I will keep ChickFilA on my radar and will probably visit 3 times a month or better indefinitely now thanks to the good food and awesome service I received."}
{"text":"Horrendous! Having been in Arizona for 7-months I thought it was time to try Chick fil A. I ordered the Charbroiled Chicken sandwich and Chick fil A Waffle Fries. The order took about 2-minutes to arrive - which concerned me immediately because I ordered my sandwich without lettuce. I got to my table, opened the sandwich box and as soon as I touched the bun I could feel the moisture of it being in a microwave. I lifted the bun to expose 2 hideous looking slices of tomato, and a sickly looking piece of chicken. Okay, I'm at a fast food restaurant, and I'm not expecting a gourmet meal. I bite into the sandwich and it has all the taste of a piece of chicken that was made last night and then tossed into the microwave the next day. I took 3 bites and I was done. Moving to those things they call waffle fries... no taste whatsoever. Ate about 7 of them. My entire dining experience took less than 9-minutes inside Chick fil A and I will NEVER EVER try it again. I should have throw $7 in the trash."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break and the way they have the drive through set up to pull into is chaotic. Ordered my food and the lady outside taking my order had an attitude and was very rude. I understand you want to keep fastest drive through in Arizona title but if that means you're going to mess up my order and give me the wrong food then it is not worth it. They couldn't even bother to put utensils in my bag for my fruit cup. I don't usually leave a review but I expect more from chick fil a."}
{"text":"It's hard to rate a Chick-Fil-A poorly because they have such a good quality product. However, this new location in front of Walmart has yet to get it's footing. 

I went here on a rainy day to pick up food for dinner and was greeted by a nice young cashier.  She took my order, but when I asked for my Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich plain she took off lettuce and tomato only. When I asked if it comes with pickles, she said she didn't know and would just press the \"no pickles\" button just in case. I'm pretty sure that all Chick-Fil-A sandwiches come with pickles. It's just their thing. 

The food also took a while to get for a to go order. They weren't that busy, and when I did get the food it wasn't that hot. My husband is also convinced they don't put salt on their fries, which I think taste good, but he has to add extra salt. 

Not a bad fast food place by far, but not yet up to the normal Chick-Fil-A standards I'm used to."}
{"text":"Super-disappointing that this location is not honoring the Teacher Appreciation offer 5/7."}
{"text":"My obsession is real. I eat here A LOT and everyone is always super friendly. My food is always hot and fresh... and their waffle fries are deeeeeelish! I order the cookies often and for the most part they are usually served warm and fresh. Some places try to nickel and dime you for every condiment you request, but at CFA the possibilities are endless. You can try and sauce and any dressing with no problem."}
{"text":"If you like Chicken, you'll love Chick fil A. Not only does it present chicken in a variety of ways, but the staff is friendly and they have free WiFi which is huge!
They don't even require one makes a purchase in order to use it which creates good will and makes a great promotional and marketing feature.
Speaking of which... I'd like to see a name the cow contest and get rid of the black shirts in favor of yellow. After all, aren't chicks yellow? Or, at least get a chick patch for the front of the shirt.
I know that having employees buy their own wardrobe helps cut costs, but let's have a little fun too."}
{"text":"The best fast food fries anywhere! Waffle fries are life! I love the breakfast here as well. Better than McDonald's breakfast menu hands down!!"}
{"text":"Shouldn't hire teenagers. One teen was talking crap about me to my MOTHER. Yes, my mother. And continued to give me dirty looks and I never said a word to her. 
Food was good, but she made the experience horrible for me"}
{"text":"We love chick-fil-A bc it offers dairy free options for our children with dairy allergies... however we have been to this location many times and 5 times in a row, we have ordered grilled nuggets and we always have to pull around bc they take longer, which is fine, but all 5 times we have had an item(s) missing... fries, or we received fried nuggets, which are not dairy free, or we were given the wrong sauce which also won't work since the bbq sauce is the only dairy free sauce, or drinks... Seems like maybe the operator needs to spend some time in there to figure things out."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment with a fast and friendly staff!  Food was prepared as ordered, all condiments were received and the dining area was spotless!! 
We love Chick Fila and it was a great stop on our shopping afternoon!  Wish our one in Boardman, Oh was this nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Food is always up to the Chick-fil-A standard; no complaints there.

I mostly use the drive through once or twice a week and they leave something out at least 25-30% of the time. I must say that I get 3 combo meals and an extra sandwich so I think the extra sandwich messes them up because it's a one-off. The way it prints on the ticket leads me to think there is a procedure flaw. It prints 3 CFA sandwich and then the next prints 1 CFA sandwich so the packer grabs the three and hands it off to the next person. I recommend you check your drive through order. If I go home and find something missing I'll go back about 1 out of 10 times. The other times i just get frustrated with them; but now that I know, it's my own fault that I don't check but hen again I shouldn't have to check right?"}
{"text":"The greatest chick-fil-a service ever...and all chick-fil-a's have great service. Always greeted with a smile. I had multiple people come over and ask me if everything was ok as I worked to get some emails done.

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I usually visit this chick-fil-a at least 2-3 times a month because it is the closest to my house, but may be driving farther to go to a different location in the future. The last three times I have visited (always through the drive-through) the cashier has gotten my order wrong (either something completely wrong, or made incorrectly), even when they say it correctly back to you when you're ordering. 

The last time I was here I had ordered a milkshake with no cherry as I am allergic to them (which I also said), drove up to the window, and was handed a milkshake with a cherry on it. When I gave it back and let them know it was supposed to no cherry, I watched the cashier through the window pick the cherry out with a napkin and cover up the leftover juice with whipped cream, then give it back to me. After asking if it had been remade, the guy didn't know what to say and didn't answer me until I told him it needed to be remade and I had seen him just pick it out with a napkin. 

Fast forward two weeks later, my husband and I are at chick-fil-a again, and we order a grilled nugget meal. Pulling up to the window, we are now given a regular (breaded) nugget meal. When we asked about it and gave it back to them, the cashier (who didn't apologize) informed us they would need to charge an additional $0.80 for the price difference. Seriously? So now we're again waiting for several minutes for the correct food after getting the wrong order. The service as this chick-fil-a used to be great, but lately is seems like all of the workers are high school kids wanting to gossip and hang out without paying attention to helping customers or doing their job. Judging from the other recent yelp reviews, we're not the only people this has happened to. The service/management at this store really needs to get it together."}
{"text":"overrated place but , food is okay the shakes are amazing. After I finished eating my food, I went back in line to try to talk to the manager. The cashier looked at me and just said \" he's busy \" rolled her eyes and was rude. I was disappointed of how disrespectful she was but understood it was busy but at least tell me nicely."}
{"text":"The food wasn't too bad. I was just giving it a shot just to see what everyone was talking about. The salads are really good though so i'll give them that. I think my favorite thing is the criss-cut fries. Its definitely a change in pace compared to the regular fast food. Thanks for the food!"}
{"text":"The food was good but it was so busy that I had to eat in my truck.  The girl got more of my order wrong than right which took quite a while to fix.  That said the sandwich came out quick and tasted good but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is always poppin! Drive thru lines during lunch can be ridiculous but the great customer service is always there! 

Visited today for breakfast for the first time ever (7:30) and there was only one car in front of me! I ordered three sandwiches (two meals and one just the entree) and paid about $16. I ordered and waited for the car in front of me (took forever) to get there food. I pulled up and like always the employee was very friendly and said hi to me and my dogs who were with me in the car. I was so glad to receive such great service early in the morning as other places have rude grouchy employees working in the morning!
I love this location!"}
{"text":"I love Chick fil a and this location is great! I have eaten here a million times, gotten carry out a bunch, and also ordered several catering orders for work clients. The service is above and beyond. I would recommend this location for any catering needs! (And a quick bite)"}
{"text":"Fast food.....that is quality.....and the BEST customer service you will ever get. 

The incredible chicken and lots-of-fresh-veggies-in-this-side-salad would be enough to keep me coming back.  But it's that \"Welcome to Chick-fil-A!\" and genuine smile that makes me want to tell all my friends about this place.

On a side note, the bathrooms and premises are always sparkling clean, making you actually want to sit down and enjoy a meal on premises."}
{"text":"This has to have been the most disappointing chick fil a I've ever been to. They have 3 jobs and only did one of them correctly. The food was fine, but the service was both unappreciative/unfriend and also extremely slow. There was only 1 cashier in a line of 8 or so people. Once my order was taken it was literally 10 minutes of standing there, along with everyone else standing there, waiting to pick up our food. They didnt even bother to apologize for their slowness. I will never go to this CFA again."}
{"text":"I don't know why people have a need to follow each other to a place with over priced chicken."}
{"text":"Waited a few months to let the hype settle down around Chick-fil-A finally making it way to Las Vegas/Henderson. Chick-fil-A is one of my coveted pit-stops on road trips to California, and I was excited to finally have a location closer by. Last Tuesday the craving could no longer be subsided, and we headed to Chik-fil-A!

We live about 25 minutes from Chik-fil-A, and wanted to take the food with us to-go. I instantly became weary when we noticed the drive through line, but was shocked when I noticed their systematic way of splitting the line into two separate lines for efficiency. This drastically reduced the time we waited in Que, and provided us with extremely efficient and accurate service. 

All of the workers are extremely friendly at Chik-fil-A, and their was an excessive amount of workers at this location! (This was great for customer service, but made me wonder when pay-roll day comes around how the business stays so well afloat...)

We ordered two spicy chicken sandwiches extra crispy with extra pickles. The extra pickles and extra crispy touch add the final touches to an already delicious chicken sandwich. The breast is perfectly proportioned to the bun, the pickles are perfectly salted, and the spicy breading is executed to provide even coverage.

We also ordered two sides of waffle potato fries (extra crispy!) and also a chicken salad cup to try. I always get all the dipping sauces (Chik-fil-A, Polynesian, Honey Mustard, Garlic & Herb Ranch, Zesty Buffalo, Barbeque, and Sriracha Sauce), but Honey Mustard is by far my favorite.

The chicken salad cup was very delicious, but was too mayonnaise-based for me to enjoy a whole sandwich of. We munched this on the car ride home while waiting to indulge into our sandwiches/fries. The sandwiches stayed perfectly crispy, and the extra pickles were not forgotten. We popped the waffle fries into our Breville Smart Oven Air (must have appliance) and had the best waffle fries of our lives! 

Overall delicious affordable dinner, and up to California Chik-fil-A expectations. Yum!

{"text":"My family and I love Chik-Fil-A, we are super excited to have this one closer to home. The service was great (A+) and we got our food hot and fast. Definitely going to be coming back for more. Welcome to Las Vegas Chik-Fil-A!"}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A location is ALWAYS swamped M-F. These corporate monsters in Uptown absolutely love themselves some chicken. 

The workers here do an incredible job getting people in and out quickly. I've never waited more than 2 minutes for my order to come up, even during peak hours. My orders (I'm always adding or taking things off sandwiches, or in this case getting pepper-jack cheese added) have been right every single time.

I don't think anyone needs a recommendation on what to get here, BUT I'll leave one anyways --- Spicy Chicken Deluxe sandwich, add bacon. And if you don't get lemonade to drink, it better be because you're getting a milkshake instead. 

Believe it or not, they're vanilla iced coffee is really good ... so treat yourself to one next time you stop for breakfast!  I just wish this location carried the bagels, but I loved the sunflower seed bagel sandwich you can get at other locations."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, mobile ordering, clean, wifi, and a kids play area. Awesome."}
{"text":"We love the food at all Chik-Fil-A restaurants but this location was so clean and ran like a well oiled machine despite the fact that it was packed. This evening, the manager on duty was very present and pleasant and should be proud of how well this location operates."}
{"text":"Have ordered here 4 times and the order has never been right. The receipt always reads correctly, but when you look in the bag something is missing or if its all there you start to eat only to find you've been given the wrong sandwich. When approaching the manager the reason given was \"well we're busy.\" I'd rather go somewhere that the employees know to actually double check the bag."}
{"text":"Hands down,  one of the best fast food joints. Spicy chicken sandwiches all the way! Usually doesn't disappoint, however, once in a while the food is cold,  otherwise,  great!"}
{"text":"Very unsatisfied with the service at this location. As some other reviewers have noted, the time it takes to get through the drive thru is RIDICULOUS. Always 20-30 minutes. And something is always missing from my order. Last time it was a whole meal, this time the dressing for a wrap. The staff is friendly in my experience i will admit but if you value your time and expect to receive what you ordered spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food. Poor service. Teenage staff more interested in talking with friends than serving customers. Unusual for Chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars simply because it's Chick-Fil-A. All Chick-Fil-A's should have at least 4 stars.  Unless it's a complete shithole, which I've never seen.  Nice staff, quick service in the drive thru.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Longest drive thru wait time in history. Literally just waited 26 minutes in line, trying to get breakfast that they refused to serve since it was past 10:30. I pulled up in line at 10:21 and once we got to the ordering part it was 10:32. We told the guy taking orders but he said to pull to the first window and his manager would take care of it. 26 minutes later, I was told they could not give me breakfast anymore. Beyond pissed. Don't waste your time here, the food is poor quality anyways and extremely overpriced. I always get a chewy (cartilage) piece or overly fried piece of chicken. Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"What a great experience! 

Despite this being a fast food. I enjoyed it. 

Customer service was great. Very friendly employees, great and clean atmosphere. I was impressed. 

Food was good as well. I ordered a fruit salad instead of fries and it was actual fruit that tastes good. There were even blueberries in it. 

I am not giving it a five stars just because it is still fast food chain. 

Nice job chick- file :-)"}
{"text":"I did drive thru a couple times they were busy but the line moved quick the staff was friendly and helpful and the food was perfect"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast good location close to the hotel I stay at and shopping"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is the most awesome fast food. It's so nice to have welcoming and friendly employees. The service and staff alone should get five stars. More places should follow their lead. I was once at this location and their were some foul mouthed men cursing up a storm while my child was sitting there. One of the employees asked them to leave because they were upsetting a lot of the families with small children. I really appreciated that. They also bring your food out and refill drinks. 

The food is great too! It's always so fresh and flavorful. My favorites are the chicken sandwich and the grilled chicken sandwich. The kids meals usually have books, math games, or toys that are actually beneficial. 

I'm glad we have a Chick-til-A in henderson!"}
{"text":"Super nice people. Told them I had never been to this chain before (I'm from Canada) and they gave me a free cookie."}
{"text":"I love this Chick fil A. The food is always warm and fresh. The only thing I would recommend for this restaurant is their work-fi. Other than that, fantastic!"}
{"text":"This weekend I went to one of my favorite fast food joints, Chick-fil-A. When I walked in, I was surprised, I was actually greeted to \"Welcome to Chick-fil-A! How may I serve you?\" Let's be honest, how many times does one actually get greeted at a fast food restaurant? Chick-fil-A is best known for their original sandwich, which is made up of a breaded chicken breast with pickles and a spray of butter on the buns. I, myself, love the Number Four Meal. 
The Number Four Meal is also known as the Spicy Chicken Sandwich Deluxe. The juicy chicken is a piece of boneless breast seasoned with a spicy blend of peppers. Included is a bun, topped off with Green Leaf lettuce and a slice of Pepper Jack cheese with pickles.  Also included in the meal are their scrumptious Waffle Potato fries with a hint of salt. Of course, you can't just eat your sandwich plain without having anything to dip it in. I personally love to have my spicy sandwich with Buffalo and Buttermilk Ranch sauce. Buffalo makes the sandwich spicier and Ranch just cools it off for the wimps in us. Normally people love their waffle fries with ketchup, but I love having my waffle fries with Chick-fil-A sauce. When dipping my waffle fries into Chick-fil-A sauce and putting it in my mouth, my taste buds just want to scream out loud and thank me for the delicious taste of my fries with Chick-fil-A sauce. Last but not least, you've got to have something to cool everything down. It could be either a soft drink or a milkshake. 
Overall, my visit to Chick-fil-A was worth it. They have friendly customer service and most of all my meal was just enjoyable. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves great customer service and most importantly appetizing food."}
{"text":"I love Chick fil a and this location is great! I have eaten here a million times! The service is above and beyond.

Chick fil a soup = heaven on a cold day"}

The food is on point and yummy. I love the waffle fries, and the fresh squeezed lemonade. I tried the spicy chicken mmmmmm. Very good!!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest. Who doesn't love Chik-fil-a? I was uber excited when I learned that Charlotte would be piloting the new chicken sliders. My initial reaction was pretty meh. I had high expectations as I am a huge fan of the chicken minis, but these just didn't do it for me. I would order again, but wouldn't be highly disappointed if they were out."}
{"text":"I thought Chick-fil-A was a southern thing but am deeply pleased to find it here in Ohio.  What I am about to say is probably sacrilege here.  It is also comparing apples to oranges in my opinion.  So here it is - If I had to choose between Chick-fil-A and White Castle, I'd choose Chick-fil-A All Day Long!  I get the #1 fried chicken sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  Go southern and put the coleslaw ON the sandwich.  (Then take the other half of the coleslaw home and put it on your hotdog the next day!)  The best!  Now onward to the lemonade.  OMG.  The diet is just as good as the regular.  I get half and half (diet and regular).  I wonder how their sweet tea is here.  So far, Ohio has proved incapable of making decent sweet tea.  I have a daughter living in Seattle that has to go to Chick-fil-A when she visits.  She even takes a pic to post wherever 20-somethings are posting these days.  Take it from a GRITS (girl raised in the south), try it!!!!"}
{"text":"This has to. E the most inefficient CFA. Ordered mobile and stood there 15 mins under the mobile pick up sign before I could get anyone's attention?! Defeats the purpose."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype. Compared to bottom rung fast food places, Chik-Fil-A is noticeably better. The service here is friendly and quick, but my chicken tenders were ready before I ordered them. The fruit cup is a nice healthy alternative for a side if you are trying to do slightly less damage to yourself by having a meal here. I've tried locations new and old in other areas and have had a very similar experience every time."}
{"text":"So far so good. All I've tried so far is the grilled chicken nuggets. They were delicious and they have a great variety of sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"The best customer service...matched only by their great food! I love the Broccoli-Kale salad and grilled nuggets! And lemonade! And milkshakes!! Always friendly."}
{"text":"love chik fil a!  i also love how they aren't afraid to talk about politics in today's day of PC, etc.  

good food, good morals, friendly employees!"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  We do not eat fast food at all however, I do not consider this place fast food.  This is an extended part of the family.  They treat me and my kids like their own.  We always feel special when they call us by name and generally cares about you!  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Came in for some lunch around 10 am early I know.  But I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and there was a little wait and the nice lady gave me a free Dr Pepper while I was waiting so nice thank you"}
{"text":"I worked in a fast food restaurant for 2 years and I understand how hard it is to work with frustrating customers. This is the only fast food place I go to where everyone is happy and wants to help. It is usually busy at meal times because its so good. I work across the street from this place and In-and-Out and I love both but normally choose them because they are so happy and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A!!! Always great service and great food. Strawberry milkshake and one of
the NEW Grilled Chicken Club Sandwiches is the perfect meal."}
{"text":"Love Chick-fil-A! Been a Raving Fan for almost 6 years. When it comes to customer service and atmosphere, it just doesn't get any better than Chick-fil-A. It's more than just a transaction, it's an experience. Great family environment and healthy choices."}
{"text":"The food is always great at this location and the employees are friendly. They are super fast but my only complaint is that when we did a drive-through order, they asked us to illegally park in a fire-lane while our food needed \"20 more seconds to finish.\" We understand that you want to quickly get everyone else's food out but we are not into breaking the law."}
{"text":"I only come here for the convince. The female manager with the long dark hair is easily the worst staff member to deal with. I've had substitutions with my sandwiches many times while other managers have been working with no problem but anytime she's working there's absolutely I way that it can be worked out. She doesn't listen and runs the place like it's her own every time she's dropped off my food in the past I have notice she's very short and never smiling- I've figured it's been from a bad or long day which I understand however this has been very consistent. The lack of decent service and a smile is actually making me feel uncomfortable to come to this location. Is working at chick-fil-a really that bad? 


On another note when Kevin Fry is working the staff and just overall feel of the restaurant (even from drive through) is entirely different in the best ways. I also appreciate the accommodations to my sandwiches that are ensured by him. 


I stop by often and wish I could leave a better review but her consistently bad attitude is really just a bummer.

***UPDATE*** 
The female manager is gone and honestly it seems that the place has perked up a bunch! Lovely!"}
{"text":"Went to this Chick Fil a with my father-in-law after shopping for a bicycle at Pro Bike next door. It was around 12:30pm and the line was the whole way across the restaurant! The drive-thru was packed and staff members were taking orders prior to the guests reaching the windows. 

The staff was nice and the food was good as usual. It appears that each Chick Fil a has their sauces and silverware in different locations - such as behind the counter where you have to ask for it or out where guests can serve themselves. I wish that was consistent among restaurants but whatever works! 

This was my first experience trying the superfood side and it was delicious! There was the right amount of dressing with a mix of dry fruit, nuts, and kale. My only gripe would be that I wish the smaller size was a little bigger as it seemed really small. 

Great breakfast, lunch, or dinner option!"}
{"text":"This Chick-Fil-A recently opened a mile from our house. So convenient! My husband and I enjoy a stop here at least once a month to retrieve our item from the cow calender. So far, the food has been on point. The staff have been very friendly and a quick to answer any questions we may have. They review your order with you, make sure you have scanned your phone (if you have the app) and are efficient at getting food served very quickly. 

I look forward to many more stops at this place, whether it is for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or simply a snack!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big chicken fan. This place makes me a believer. It's good fast food. They don't use cheap, dirty ingredients like most fast food chains.  It's like a chicken version of in & out. Their menu also offers great sauces and fresh salads."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service.

As a Virginia native and frequent east coast traveler, Chick-fil-A has been a part of my fast food diet for as long as I can remember. 

The news of Chick-fil-A opening in Las Vegas was a long time coming.

With the initial opening of this location, food was just average...however as time progressed, I believe the food quality and taste has improved greatly. Never any issues with my food orders.

My experiences are limited to drive thru only, but all interactions have been friendly and prompt. 
Lunch time rush is handled well as employees will often walk down the line of cars to obtain orders in advance of the window. Breakfast line moves even faster."}
{"text":"Out of all the whack chains around Arrowhead Chick Fil A is actually a really pleasant option to have.  Chick Fil A makes some of the best fast food chicken sandwiches.  My favorite to get is the deluxe with lettuce and tomatoes.  Then I like to get a side of the hot buffalo sauce and pour it over the chicken.  The chicken is always hot fresh and juicy.  The waffle fries are also great.  Crisp but still fluffy and always fresh.  I always get the fresh lemonade.  It almost feels like you are not eating at a fast food joint.

I also love the fact they are closed on Sundays.  My family always has Sunday get togethers and I remember my younger brothers would often have jobs that made them work and we would miss out on the one day we could spend together.  I personally think they are doing it right when it comes to the food and as a bonus their policies."}
{"text":"By far the worst Chick-fil-A I have ever been to... and I have been to a lot in my lifetime. They are super rude, extremely slow, have a dirty restaurant, and overall, they just completely ruin the reputation of CFA. Even when I'm near this location, I do my best to avoid dining at this location."}
{"text":"Consistently courteous and clean! The staff is always accommodating with special order requests. Supports local schools and nonprofits."}
{"text":"This by far has to be one of the best Chick Fil A that i come to. I normally go inside but this time I went through the drive thru. I was a little worried because the line was pretty long and I had to get to an appointment. I decided to risk it and to my surprise they are fairly quick. We went through the full line in less than 10 mins and everything was hot and delicious. The coffee was also really good, the staff was very friendly. One of my favorites to come to, especially since they are located in a high traffic area."}
{"text":"Overpriced and below average. The soup was like canned, the chicken tenders have very little flavor.  The portions are small"}
{"text":"This location is absolutely my favorite location! Even though the drive through line always looks long, it's still fast and if they do think that it's too long of a wait, they have their employees out here with iPads taking orders to make everything go faster. The inside is always clean and they are always nice at this location."}
{"text":"Awesome place in every way.   Friendly and super quick.  Clean each and every time I arrive.  Way better than any other fast food.  Best in class!"}
{"text":"One of the busier Chick-fil-A's but they move through the line quickly. The cashier, Venice, is absolutely fantastic and sweet as can be."}
{"text":"Two stars because it's still better than other fast food places, but they need try start living up to the CFA standard (waiting time, food, etc)"}
{"text":"I have never had any problems at this place. Today Latesha who was working the counter was wonderful! She greeted me with a smile, helped me pick out a drink for the kids meals that would travel well and gave me enough sauce that I didn't even have to ask for more! What really got me is when she asked for my name she then thanked me for coming in and wish me to have a great day. It's just nice to have great customer service every once in awhile. Great job!"}
{"text":"The staff are always very friendly, you would think it's going to be packed on opening day but they have a system that breezes you through the lines in or out.

I love their food here and you wouldn't expect them to have good shakes but they are very good...the chocolate is very choclaty, thick and delicious. 

My wife always gets one of each sauce and they never charge you extra like a lot of other fast food joints and CF has like 10 different sauces."}
{"text":"I do love chick-fil-a...but I just left this place without getting my fix. Stood In Line for over 10 minutes. I was the only one in line. Only one register working and the worker was taking an order for a group of 10 people, one at a time. Lots of people walking around but no one offered to man one of the two empty registers to help me. Seriously?  What a joke. Must be nice to have so much business that you can just ignore customers. No respect."}
{"text":"Only second time I came here, and this is the only fast food place I'll 5 star.

- The workers actually greet you and are ready to take your order when you enter.

-They bring- yes, bring, the food to you when it is ready. 

-It's not a hot mess like most joints, although there are usually roudy kids running around the play area.

-They *gasp* say thank you! And more than just once too, AND ask you if you'd like a refill if you're hanging by the front with your cup??



If you're like me, you like spicy..

Check out #4, Spicy Chicken Sandwich meal, blows Jacks Spicy Chicken out of the water. Is a little better than Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich.

Please - - open on sundays, dammit."}
{"text":"I cant wait for them to come to Tacoma! Went here on way to Amys Bakery and was very pleased with the service and the chicken I got was very tender!
I would come back here that is for sure!"}
{"text":"My baseball team went here for lunch. They claim the hottest fast food employee in the nation works here. It's worth taking a look. 

#GPH"}
{"text":"I was so glad to hear that CFA was coming to the valley. This one opened and it's near my house. After seeing the drive thru lines, I held off as long as I could but I was over that way 
and I was hungry so I went inside for a classic CFA chicken sandwich.

It was worth the wait. Nobody makes a chicken sandwich like CFA. Always hot and fresh.
I'll definitely be back regularly."}
{"text":"This is the best Chicky Lay by far! It is a weekly stop for me! They always get my number one with extra pickles and a side of pickles perfect, even with my complicated orders. The staff is always friendly and usually remembers me and actually seems to genuinely care. I don't think they sarcastically are saying \"my pleasure,\" but they are simply being great employees! Love me some Chick-fil-A"}
{"text":"The staff here is always so nice and I've never had a problem with my orders. Super clean inside and out, I came in earlier today with my boyfriend and Zach jones took care of us and really made our experience here better than before. He gave us some recommendations and tips on what sauces and etc to have with our meals. We had a little conversation and I hope his excellent customer service is praised and appreciated by the company as well as other customers"}
{"text":"They finally made it to Vegas, I am from the ATL where chick-fil-a originated in a mall. What an experience. Busy as can be but we found parking and although there was a line it moved swiftly . We ordered ( old school for me) and sat down , moments later our order was brought to us, nice touch. The dining room was very clean and the staff  was pleasant and constantly moving. The kids play area looked fun and the young-uns were enjoying it. You can get jugs of lemonade to go so I know that's going to happen. Welcome to Las Vegas C F A , we are glad to have you"}
{"text":"I tried really hard to boycott these LGBT haters but the chicken is so good and the employees who work here are so nice. Seriously, how did they get these 14 year olds to say \"my pleasure\" after everything? 

My favorite go to's - #1 the classic chicken sandwich, strawberry milkshake (cause I'm a fat ass), and waffle fries (again, cause I'm a fat ass). I appreciate their healthy options too. 

Minus one star for being closed on Sundays when you want chick fil a the most. Super inconvenient to my cravings."}
{"text":"Slowest CFA I've ever been to.  My frosted coffee was not frosted.  My fries and chicken strips were cold.  I want my $8.71 back.   Ridiculous for Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is the best fast food you will find in the state of Arizona. Food tasted the people were as nice as can be. The service was unbelievably good and the food was delicious, recommend this for anyone"}
{"text":"I love chic fil a in general, I always come to this chic fil a for lunch and it's awesome. The service is fast, and they are always so nice. I've noticed that being a trend at every chic fil a I go to though."}
{"text":"This chick-fil-a always delivers the best customer service  To the store manager: you have an A-MAZING STAFF!!! 
My morning was upside down to start but your morning staff turned that around 
Best start to my day!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location, I always get my food quick and it always tastes fantastic. I use the app and order from home, as soon as I get there the food is ready and already paid for. This is great for anyone with a smart phone who hates waiting because it is so easy to use. I have gone here many times and never have had an issue with a wrong order or messed up order so that is great when it comes to fast food and drive-thru restaurants. Great food and fast service my fave."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken sandwich was really tasty. Southern style, so pickles and mayo. Still fast food, but tastes pretty fresh. If you have kids, they have a great play land. Staff were very friendly. If wait til after the holidays til the hype dies down though."}
{"text":"Zachary helped me & took my order this guy creeped me with. He was trying to talk in some fake accent, probably to amuse himself but it was uncomfortable & off putting. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Everybody knows how awesome Chik-Fil-A is but who knew they had awesome employees too? My debit card was damaged and their machine couldn't read it so they gave me my food for free. Most places would say oh well and throw the food away. I love this place. Can't wait until we get one in Metro Detroit."}
{"text":"Walked in assuming it be a friendly nice atmosphere, the young girl that helped us seemed impatient with us, it was my moms 1st time here so i wanted her to take a look around and observe the menu. I obviously knew what i wanted, i always order the same when im in California area, figure try it out here in Vegas. . . . Not the same atmosphere. It wasn't busy when we walked in, though the staff seem to be in an oddly rush for no reason. If you work for Chick fil A, i suggest the staff know who they represent and what kind of fast food you are working for. Its really true what they say about Henderson maybe. . . I wonder if the other location will be un satisfing too. I gave them a 3, the fries were perfect, my nuggets for a little burnt and the grilled chicken was a little cold when served to us. . . Though this is a fast food joint so i guess we need to expect it once in awhile!?!?!"}
{"text":"Great service, super tasty food. My favorite is the classic chic-fil-a sandwich with the carrot salad and the waffle fries. The chic-fil-a sauce is great for fry dipping. Their shakes are tasty too."}
{"text":"Honestly, based on my last visit and my experience with or lack there of with what they call customer service they don't even deserve one star! I went to this location TWO months ago and my experience/issues still have not been resolved. I spent over $7-8 on the 8 count chicken nugget meal. The chicken nuggets were all cold and the fries were all cold and soggy. The fries were so gross and awful that they were inedible. The only reason the nuggets were slightly edible was because I had just spent close to $8 on a meal from a fast food restaurant that I couldn't bare to waste. You may ask why I didn't bring my meal back and the reason I didn't is because by the time I noticed my food was this back was because I had just got on the freeway and it was too late. I was so disappointed by this food as I have been going to this location with family and by myself for several years and have never had this experience. I immediately tried contacting someone through the \"contact us\" on the website and they stopped responding after like a week. The corporate people or more specifically someone named Lee gave me a ticket number for further service and I then disappeared. So then after weeks of no response through corporate, I turned to Facebook and no response. Then the franchise owner Jeff Myles said he would take care of it. Well that's been over three weeks and still nothing. Worst customer service ever. Done with this restaurant. Will now be going elsewhere such as McDonald's and Sonic and Wendy's."}
{"text":"They make a drive thru for your convince however when they don't give you your complete order it becomes very inconvenient.   
Quality control is a must for this location! 
Three happy people in our car and 1 unhappy person!!!"}
{"text":"Come on.... who doesn't love this restaurant? It's so delicious with amazingly fast and courtesy customer service."}
{"text":"You can tell this place is well managed. The workers are happy, the music was nice, and the bathrooms, which are lightly decorated, are clean and smell nice! Bravo Chick-fil-A :)

Oh, and the food was great, as always."}
{"text":"Always good food but the service is unmatched at any fast food location. It takes special kind of employees to work here"}
{"text":"Horrid service! Ordered sausage/egg biscuit in drive through. Was told to pull around would be out in 2 minutes. No designated wait area, so am stuck waiting behind parked cars. Everyone is mad as i have to keep driving around. Waited for 15 minutes...finally parked to go in to get my order. They put it together then ... All cold...IF YOU ARE ASKED TO PULL AROUND...GET YOUR MONEY BACK ON THE SPOT! Food average, cold, service horrid!"}
{"text":"I am so impressed by this location! The food was good, but the service was excellent. I have never been more pleased with a fast food restaurant experience."}
{"text":"We're just traveling through and I was so impressed with this Chic-fil-a! This was the most friendly chic-fil-a I've visited, and we all know that's saying a lot! They were so friendly and helpful and went out of their way to help me when my hands were full with my toddler girl. They also took the time to recommend a nearby park to visit as we were traveling. Thank you for your kindness!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Love their Chick fil a sauce!! Will be my goto spot when I crave chicken. :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service, my nuggets were given to me cold,  after taking them back to the manager requesting fresh food, she brought me nuggets at roughly the same temperature witching not even two minutes and I know the food would not have been cooked within the time frame, very disappointed with you chic-fil-a and I frequent your locations across the valley, this was definitely the worst  meal I have received from one of your chains."}
{"text":"Not going back since they didn't have the full menu on opening day, it was my first time there, I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food is just as good as any other. Inside though every time I go In there they are so slow. I suggest just hit the drive thru. I always just stand at the register and no one helps me, even though I've made eye contact with them. I counted 9 people behind the counter and one was a manager just walking around. The one kid that helped me  was cleaning out the ice cream machine and had to stop doing what he was doing since no one else was serving us; His name was Wisdom ( great kid). This has been the third time I've gone inside that store and no one seems to ever assist me. I shouldn't have to flag someone down and ask them if I could order, I could understand if there was 1 or 2 people working but 8 or 10 makes no sense. Customer service is at the top at my workplace but this place doesn't really seem like they care."}
{"text":"This Chic Fila never misses to disappoint everything about this chic fil a sucks people that don't care about customer service employees act like they all work at mcdonalds honestly think the owner and management of this chic fil a should be embarrassed to have the logo on this their building because they don't represent chic fila at all!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A, and I appreciate how on top of things the company seems to be with all of the new restaurants they are rolling out around Vegas. Everyone is very well-trained, there are a LOT of staff members around to help direct traffic and take orders for the huge lines, and despite all the crowds, they really do run things like a well-oiled machine. 

Chick-Fil-A's are pretty standard with their good food and good service, but I especially appreciate this location. There is plenty of parking and not a lot of heavy traffic in the area, so I got in and out of there with my food really quickly, which was fantastic."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. This is my first time getting Chic-Fil-A since I moved to Las Vegas from MD. I've been craving Chic-Fil-A since I moved so I was SUPER excited about this location opening and about getting breakfast...I've always ordered the same thing, a spicy chicken biscuit with added bacon and egg. After waiting in the long line...I finally approached the window and explained to the young lady what I wanted. She told me it wasn't offered and I explained that this is the only thing I've ordered for breakfast. I guess she checked in with management and then added the sandwich meal and an extra order of hash brown. My total came to about $11.00...how does one sandwich meal and a side of hash browns come to $11.00? Who knows...the young lady didn't know either and asked me to pull around. When I pulled up to the window where there were two employees, one asked me did I order? (no...I've just been sitting in this line forever). I responded yes and inquired about when the spicy biscuit was removed from the menu  (maybe it's a west coast thing) and also why my total was $11.00 (I normally pay $11.00 for two meals). They explained that because the sandwich was no longer offered they had to charge me individually for the chicken, the bacon, and the egg, and the drink, and the to make it..I explained that I understood that but that is bad business...the employee asked for a manager to better explain (which wasn't needed, I wanted to pay a normal price..$5-6). The manager reexplained the same thing (which wasn't needed, btw), and I asked for just the sandwich and side of hash browns which still came up to over $7...UNBELIEVABLE. So by now I'm frustrated so I just hand them my card because I'm ready to go...I give him one card which he said declined (which it didn't, how disrespectful), then I gave him another card...which also didn't work..and he asked me for a third card.....I told him it wasn't my cards it was the machine. So he finally got assistance to fix the machine and my card worked...then I left. Worst service, poor management for not offering exceptional service like Chic-Fil-A normally does. On top of driving over 30 mins and waiting over 15 mins for \"fast food\" I will never go to this establishment again. Also, I followed up with the Owner after the situation and explained everything to him and was offered no real solution..just an \"I hope you decide to visit us again\""}
{"text":"Unbelievable customer service, I was on Drive-through and the lady that took my order was the nicest person I have ever dealt with.  They are so friendly and They make your experience to be a enjoyable one. Thank you my Chick-fil-A team, my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful and quick drive through. I've only had a fruit cup here but I  just wanted to write about how great the drive through is. We've never had anything missing from our order and the quickness of this place has really helped us get to work on time in the morning. Highly recommended for a quick breakfast if you're staying at the Hilton University Center.

Went here again this morning - Also note that they have Simply Orange OJ!! Their egg and cheese Biscuit and yogurt parfait with granola are delicious too."}
{"text":"Slowest Chick-fil-A ever... was in a semi hurry drove up, drive thru was PACKED, inside wasn't busy at all. Went inside, no line. No one even acknowledged  I was waiting to order. Finally after joking with all the kids behind the counter, someone got my order. After that I sat and waited FOREVER while the kids continued to joke around in the back. No wonder the drive thru was so slammed. These children didn't have any sense of urgency. Even heard what seemed like a manager make pretty crude joke for anyone to hear. Extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Pretty happy with my visit to Chic-Fil-A today...

This location is on the back / corner side of Northlake Mall, but shares an area of \"Northlake Commons\", which has other shops & restaurants.  Therefore, for dining inside, you're sharing the parking lot space with a Red Robin & other shops.  For me today, I used the drive through...which is a long lane to just get to the ordering spot.  Of course, it was close to 12 PM, lunchtime, so the line was pretty long.  Luckily, when I got up to the ordering part (I had waited in the lane line for about 5+ minutes), it was quick to actually get my food.  The girl, Erica, who took my order was very pleasant & sweet.  

My nuggets were HUGE - YUM! - & a nice surprise I got an extra one. ;) Surely it wasn't on purpose, but it was a nice surprise nonetheless.  The slaw was cold & perfect.  

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a wreck and is run incredibly poorly.

Every time I go by I'll say 'please make sure my food is hot' and they graciously say 'of course' and then give me the coldest, stalest fries that are beyond inedible. They are like cardboard brick. 

I'm from Texas and was practically raised on this food and was always, always impressed with how the food was always so hot and fresh unlike other fast food places that just give you whatever is left over. I never failed to get hot food. 

Imagine my surprise when this independently owned (with zero oversight from corporate) gave me cold, bland food. I was floored. This isn't the restaurant I grew up eating at. This is some poorly run and managed money-saving racket that ONLY cares about the bottom line. 

I don't usually care to write reviews about fast food places because we all know most don't care what food they throw at you, but I really expected more from Chick-Fil-a. Sadly, this junk heap is a major disappointment, but the only one near me so I either accept their crappy food or I go without. What a shameful choice from such an iconic brand. 

I'd be embarrassed to own this and to sully such a great reputation."}
{"text":"The drive-thru service is AMAZING, ESPECIALLY during prime hours! They have incredibly polite and knowledgeable staff (sometimes the manager too) outside to take your order as soon as you pull up, before you reach the speaker. They are never anything other than polite and consummate customer service professionals, even when you have numerous orders! Every other fast food chain could learn a thing or two from CFA!"}
{"text":"Needed breakfast and i cruised through an empty drive through to sample the wares. Try finding an empty drive through here at lunch!! The biscuit sandwich is usually my go-to item at most places and this was the typical egg, bacon and cheese variety. Everything gets compared to McDonald's, so in that respect, nothing was as good as the big breakfast dog.
The Biscuit - more chewy, like a biscuit English muffin.
The potatoes - resembled and tasted like microwaved potato pellets.
Eggs, bacon - slightly less tasty than McD's
Coffee - good enough.
Combo Price - about $5.50,  in the breakfast ballpark.

It was worth a try, but will be returning only for the sandwiches and going back to McD's breakfast biscuits when needed."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the fast food here, my first chick fill a. Be careful when exiting and entering at the delivery window side. its crazy making.cars can be coming in right in front of you, you are trying to exit after picking up your food, and there's another car lane next to you that can be driving out too. Poorly designed."}
{"text":"The manager is literally so rude... She should be the big cow.. And she doesn't even need to put the mascot on."}
{"text":"First time I came here they got my order totally wrong. I ordered grilles chicken but after I drove away found our that I had a spicy chicken instead. Since I was in a hurry to get to a meeting didn't have time to go back & change it. 

The spicy chicken was good but I had really wanted grilled instead of fried. Next time I will check my order before I drive away.

Chick-fil-A is normally good about making sure stuff is right so I will chalk this error up to their being a newly opened store."}
{"text":"Love this Chick Fil A. I love their spicy chicken. The best part of this location is their Best Service. I would never go to drive through since I know I am getting a GREAT service inside."}
{"text":"Excellent Service - Extremely clean - Friendly staff. Went there this AM for a promotional breakfast item available only in the drive thru. At the window I told them my wife and I were taking advantage of the promotion but would be inside in a moment to supplement the items in the promotion. The manager said how about you tell me what else you would be ordering and I will have it all ready when you get inside. We gave him our additional order and as promised when we got inside everything was waiting for us at a booth in a quiet part of the restaurant. I paid for the additional items and the manager said he was still brewing fresh coffee and he would bring it over once it was done. The food was hot and very tasty, it was an item neither my wife nor I had tried before (breakfast bowls) thus I suspect the promotion. The manager delivered the gallon of Iced Tea we ordered along with the fresh hot coffee. I know Chick-fl-a has some detractors due in part to the views of the chain's founder - however with that said while you might not care for the founders opinions you will always find the local restaurants have extremely friendly staff, a very clean interior and excellent food. While half of our breakfast (the promotional items) were free the manager still stopped by a couple of times to make sure everything was satisfactory. As he worked the serving line and delivered meals to those eating in as will as take out it was apparent that he managed this location as it it was his own and that spirit carried over to the staff.  
Other well known fast food chains have offered free breakfast or lunch items strictly to generate repeat traffic. Chick-fl-a only has promotions to introduce new food offerings. Quite a concept -  offer clean facilities, friendly staff and excellent HOT food and as a result you won't need to bribe your customers with freebees to come back."}
{"text":"So obviously this was a long time coming, and as it opened very recently, it has been SLAMMED. I've visited twice so far, and both times I tried to get there around 10:30 to avoid the crowds. It was still crowded, but luckily ordering ahead of time with the app saved a lot of time and hassle, and the team did a great job managing the crowds and running orders around. If the crowds ever die down enough, it's got a nice big dining area inside (the layout is similar to St. George's location with lots of seating). The location they chose was kind of ridiculous, though. I don't know why every Chick-Fil-A has to be stuck in an awkward part of a shopping center where it's a pain to get in and out. The parking lot is small so you'll probably have to park away from it and hike over for quite awhile. The food and service, though, are definitely winners, and both are what Chick-Fil-A is known for."}
{"text":"Super efficient and friendly chick fil a. 

It gets crowded but they do their best to keep it flowing.

One tip is to use mobile ordering to skip the line and just pick up food."}
{"text":"I have never once in my life criticized a Chick-fil-A. Their chain has always had great quality food good morals and generally very good service. This store was the exception in terms of service. I can't emphasize enough how slow and disorganized they seemed. I was there at about 8 o'clock this morning which was a Saturday and it wasn't all that busy but people were standing around waiting on their orders while there was one employee sleeping at a table and others walking around visibly doing very little to help out the confusing and slow situation. I gave this store two stars only because of their food. I am surprised by how poorly run the store seem to be."}
{"text":"Honestly.... I'm whatever about ChikFilA, but this place is doing it right!

The customer service here is amazing compared to all the other Chikfilas I been too, and I'm from LA. 

[x]Smiles 
[x]Happiness 
[x]Customer Service 

Literally made the food taste just that much better cause of their amazing attitude.

Whatever you guys are doing, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Love Chick-fil-A but this location is a disaster and a half. Management must be terrible because I have never once gone here and not had a really bad experience. Do yourself a favor and hit the amazing location at the Waterfront instead. Everyone here is really rude, and it's just not a good experience."}
{"text":"This Chickfila is the best location in the Pittsburgh area. The manager is clearly doing a great job because every staff member I've encountered has been very kind. And I eat a lot of Chickfila so that's saying something.  With the new app and mobile ordering, Chickfila takes the spot as best fast food around, and with the continued excellent customer service here, I will only get a quick meal here if I'm in the market for one."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service- Chicken is so fresh & the workers there really show that they love their job. 

I was there last night & the night manager \"Kenny\" a younger guy brought out our food & was checking on us to see if we needed anything- He had a spark in his eye & said he would own a chik-fil-a himself one day....now thats what i like to see in my employees!!!"}
{"text":"I only have a funny story to tell about this place. Actually about the name. I'm from MI and we don't have Chic-Fil-A. So, I'm driving along one day shortly after moving to AZ, and I pass my first ever Chic-Fil-A. As as I glanced at this hyphenated,  almost-cursive written brand name, I said out loud \"Chica Flicka!? What  kinda place is that?\" I even went so far as to call a friend from here and asked....\"Tracy, what the hell is Chicka-Flicka\"?\" After being dumbfounded for a minute, she figured it out and said \"NO silly, its Chic-Fil-A\"!! To date, I still call it Chica-Flicka cuz its sooooo much more funny to say!!! 

Oh, and as fast food goes, its pretty good! I never eat fast food, so I don't really know how to rate! :-)"}
{"text":"I love, love their food; when they make it right. Which unfortunately is very rare!!! My favorite for breakfast is the multigrain bagel with cream cheese.  Well three times in a row they had taken more than 15 minutes to give it to me. Not only that but a couple of those times my bagel was cold.  Same thing has happened to my wife more than a couple of times. In fact she was there this morning and asked for a breakfast sandwich at drive thru and instead she got a chicken sandwich.  When she went back to let them know of their mistake a lady asked her twice if she was sure she got the wrong order.  My wife answered yes both times and ask the lady for a refund since she was being rude about it. The lady said they would fix it. So they did and when lady came back with correct order she told my wife in a ride way to check it so she wouldn't walk out with the wrong order again.  My wife never received an apology for it.  
It really sucks not to be able to get a good meal at this place.  All of us at home love their food.  It's a shame the staff is not properly trained or they just don't care of providing good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is always great. The line may seem long, but the service is always fast and the employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"3 stars because I am glad to have a location close.  Can't wait until they get in the flow because they are slooooooooooow!!!  Every time I have come it's been 20plus minutes to get food.  Even in the drive through. 

Update: Ended up leaving and donating my meal to another customer.  I couldn't wait any longer.  Too bad. For now I think I will go to the other location a few more miles away."}
{"text":"I love chick fila! BUTTTT this is the 3rd time that I have a problem with them within a week.  I ordered a salad through the drive tru, they gave me the wrong salad again! 3rd time! :( I don't have time to go back exchange it. Now I have to sit here at my desk just eat scraps as I don't eat/like the grilled chicken salad that I paid for. Well, I'm still hungry and frustrated to have to throw away this $9 salad, AGAIN! :/ please chick fila triple check the drive thru orders before giving it out. If I could or had time I would come back and exchange it. I was using the drive thru for a reason, I don't have time to come in. :( I love chick fila but I just can't come to this location without making sure I got the right stuff."}
{"text":"Every single time I go to this restaurant, they mess up my order. I don't understand why they constantly mess up our orders. Someone please retrain these people."}
{"text":"All the times I've been here, I can't believe I haven't written a review yet!

This location - like any other Chic-Fil-A - stays super busy. A plus though, they have the double drive-through. 

I've been taking advantage of their mobile app & ordering ahead. While finding parking can be tricky, luckily, my order is always ready when I walk in the door, so I don't have to wait long.

Consistent service & the taste of food, always makes me come back."}
{"text":"Being Vegas born & raised I had no clue what chick-fil-A was about. I had had it only once prior in a trip through Utah and it was beyond basic and I swore off Chick-fil-A and it's hype... until this and other locations opened in Vegas and the HYPE BEAST came out in full force again... I tried it again just the other day and I was IMPRESSED not only was the service the best I've ever been too from a fast food in my entire life but the food was AMAZING and fresh... I don't know what Utah chick-fil-A was on but Henderson/Vegas chick-fil-A saved their a$$... will be returning FOR SURE"}
{"text":"One of my favorite chicken places to eat. 
Always fresh and delicious 
Staff is alway helpful. 
My drive through orders are always complete. No worries"}
{"text":"I've never eaten at a Chick-fil-A before. I tried it with a 3 piece filet and the standard Chick-fil-A sauce and an ice tea - I didn't want to throw away a lot of money if it turned out to be a very bad idea. Instead I was delighted with both the service and the cleanliness and the food! I'm not a regular fast food eater but I would make this my go-to place. To add to my excellent experience the young man at the counter informed me that Chick-fil-A was buying my lunch. Unbelievable! And when he dropped it off in front of me he said thank you and God bless you. They've won me over!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Just what Vegas needed! Fast and friendly staff! Highly recommended. Had the spicy chicken, amazing!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and all I got was a big old bag or mormanism in my face. Stop forcing your religion on people who aren't married to multiple underage wives. Will never be back."}
{"text":"I've never  been to the CFA, but I was in Mesa at a conference, and my colleague loves CFA, so that's where we went.   I know the political incorrectness, but I actually love the food and the ambiance.  The place is clean, not noisy, not crowded; there are servers who bring the food to you, and refill the drinks. The service is a little slow, but not that bad.   The chicken sandwich was deliciously fried, with tomato and lettuce (I got the deluxe).  The waffle fries were not crispy, but not greasy (my only reason for the four not five stars).  All in all,everything was delicious, especially the peach milkshake, which was topped with whipped cream.  I would go again."}
{"text":"I was here for the opening of the store. I did that overnight thing where I hung out in the parking lot and got 52 free cards for meals. That was mang years ago.
Since then, I've gone back many times. The food has been consistent and the service has always been great. When I worked nearby, I would come here for many busy lunches, and they always kept everything moving very quickly."}
{"text":"Chic-Fil-A's are pretty much all the same & that's one reason why I like them so much.  This location is in the busy Afton Ridge shopping center. Every meal or milkshake :)  has been consistent with quality & taste. While I sometimes grumble about the prices, I am willing to pay more for food that tastes good, along with receiving friendly customer service.  

They have plenty of parking & a kid's playground out front. The restaurant & parking lot are always clean & free of trash. It's pretty easy to get in & out & back onto i-85."}
{"text":"As far as service goes, this location is just like any other - although here they seem super friendly, having a personal conversation with you. Yesterday I got complimented on my glasses & how cute my dog Milo is. :)

At around 1 PM on a nice & sunny Saturday, it was still busy. As Chad E. aluded to, it's a pain to get & in of.  If the line in the drive thru is long, it's hard for those trying to get in and around the parking lot.  I was probably in line close to 10 minutes by the time I got to order.

Food as always, was tasty. My nuggets were cooked perfectly & my coleslaw was filled to the top of the bowl.  My boyfriend's chicken strip salad was good too. Lettuce was nice & crisp, not brown. Chicken was cooked perfectly.

I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"This location is fantastic! The food is fresh, the people are friendly and everything is clean! The atmosphere is bright and peppy. The pricing is decent and the theme is pro-family."}
{"text":"Honestly , I don't love fast food but this restaurant is very close for me to get to for lunch. 

The reason I love this restaurant is because I always get my food fast and it is always correct. It's always hot and very good. 

The food is the same no matter which location I visit but the service here is excellent. The ladies taking my order are fun and friendly. They always make me smile and laugh.

The are efficient here ! The drive thru is always busy and they have people taking orders outside most of the time to move the line along. 

I don't love fast food but I do enjoy this restaurant! Lastly they have wifi and a play place for kids and not many places have both of those !"}
{"text":"Terrible wait EVERY time!  Why can't they get it right??  Every other Chick Fil A has people rest to take to take your order! I can't believe no one has stepped in and made this location get better!  Help!!"}
{"text":"Lightning speed service! \"May I help who's next\" and a warm smile greet every customer even when the lines are super long. Efficiently and carefully, they prepare your meal and then call out your name. My sandwich was delicious and up to standard, tangy and tart freshly squeezed lemonade. My daughter liked her nuggets. Props to the Chik-Fil-A crew at ASU Tempe!"}
{"text":"Mobile app. I didn't know how to use the Mobile App, and the friendly server walked me through the download and the check-in. She also gave me a tip: do not complete your order until you walk through the door so that your food gets to you nice and fresh. I waited at a bar counter with the Mobile sign above. I got my food nice and toasty and enjoyed it there. I love their Chik-Fil-A sauce and their freshly squeezed lemonade. When you hang out there, the servers are sweet and come by to fill up your lemonade for free. Remember, they don't open on Sundays. Try their breakfast biscuits and hash browns. Yum!"}
{"text":"Only fast food place I'll go to! Plus their app keeps giving me freebies.  Got free sandwich for online order, loaded it w/ TLC (Tom Lett Chee) & they prepared it w/ TLC. It actually looked like the picture. Waffle fries good too. 
They got the best milkshakes around as well. 
But the most amazing thing was the freaky fast service, & I'm not talkin bout that lame sub chain!  
I pressed the \"I'm Here\" button on App as I was walking in. The girl at counter addressed me, & as I'm adding item to my order another girl calls my name and had my online order ready. It was literally 1 min!  Then I asked for cup of ice water & the girl pulled it out of nowhere b/c she didn't walk away so.. maybe the other girl heard & slipped it under her arm or some magic!? Before I could walk to napkin hut, another one calls my name and adds 2nd order to my bag. Whole thing took merely 2 mins!"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A has good food.  Typical fast food fare, but they set themselves apart with their customer service.  This location is great and you can't beat the free Yelp check-in shake."}
{"text":"Love the sandwich and they are rated right under Chipotle and panera for chicken used with less anti biotic.   I try to stay away from fast food chain but this is my weakness."}
{"text":"Night and day difference between service and product between here and McDonald's next store.  Every time I come here everybody is on the ball and very friendly.  Whomever the GM is here is a winner.  Good team"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love chick-fil-a but recently people at this location either don't know how to count or are a bunch of thieves. Third time in a row where I've only received 10 grilled nuggets instead of the 12 I've paid for.  If you don't mind being cheated out of what you paid for you have come to the right location.  Used to come here all the time but will travel a little further to do business now."}
{"text":"This is seriously the worst Chick-fil-A
out of all of them. The portion sizes are always so small and overcooked. The last time i was there, i went through the drive thru , for a kids meal, for my daughter. The following pic is what she received.  When I called to complain, the manager Ben apologized, and said he would send 1 coupon to replace the meal since I couldn't come back and they were closing soon.  I asked if he could throw in a couple coupons for my inconvenience since he was only offering to send 1. He said he didn't have the authorization to do that. I replied \"wow, for a manager, they sure don't give you a lot of power. So nothing for my inconvenience? \"  his reply...\" well, you said only the nuggets were bad, the coupon is for a kids meal,  so you'll get fries and a drink too.\" I said \"ok, whatever, here's my address. ..\" well, it's been about 3 to 4 weeks and I have yet to receive my 1 coupon. I would have let it go, but it was my 6 year old daughter's bday the other day and my husband took her there per her request. That's her favorite place.  Same problem with the chicken! Ben wasn't there to talk to, so anyway we're just never gonna go back to that location.  Thanks for nothing marketplace Chick-fil-A and Ben!"}
{"text":"Out of every chick fil a we've been to, this one has got to be the best. As soon as you walk in the door,  you have about 3 or 4 smiling employees greeting you.  I never feel rushed when placing an order and the whole place is always clean.  Even after we've gotten our food,  employees are approaching asking if we need anything else and even taking our trash away for us. This location is a little further than the market Street location,  but we come here because we always have a much better experience!"}
{"text":"Our order came out super quick, the waitress took it to our table and brought us straws and napkins. All staff was super friendly. The food was beyond yummy! I could come here every day"}
{"text":"Food was great as always! The cookies and creme shake is Ah-maxing!!! But the best part is the friendly employees they greet you when you come in. Helpful employees that come to your table to clean your trash or bring you to go bags before you leave. And even when the counters busy they recognize you when you're coming in and when you're leaving. All the employees were very friendly and smiling."}
{"text":"You cannot get a better fast food experience anywhere else!  This is the place to be.  The service in AMAZING - they always blow away any expectations I have (and they are high expectations!)  The food is always hot, fresh, fast and reasonably priced.  The staff is amazing and they will even come out to your tables to give further service if needed.  Can't get this level of service at the most expensive restaurants downtown sometimes!  I just love everything about Chick-fil-a and especially this location.  They are all about the customer service and the details.  Way to go!!!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A. Just wanted to get that out there. I love their grilled chicken sandwich, which is what I always order. Their lemonade is also good. I used to get the little chicken nuggets and have always liked them as well. So to review, Chick-Fil-A is awesome. Their staff is always very kind and provide superior customer service. I am a major fan."}
{"text":"Been here twice in one weekend since Vegas doesn't have one , yet. Kourtney was nice but messed up both times we were there with our orders. Either missing food, wrong drinks and wrong sauce. Granted this place was super busy."}
{"text":"I recently moved here, (a little less than a year ago), and I love Chick-Fil-A. Unfortunately, this one is not anywhere near as friendly as others that I've gone to. The people who take your order don't really let you speak to make changes to your order. They seem to go 100 miles per hour, which is fine. I get its a FAST food restaurant, but I should also be able to get a word in on my order if I want it well done or no pickles or whatever. 

I also noticed that their chicken isn't always fully cooked through. I want to say 90% of the time I've ate here, the chicken had been warm on the outside and pretty cool in the middle. And you could just taste the chicken and how it didn't taste fully cooked. Typically I will ask for well done on the sandwich because I feel that it would cook the inside a bit more, but that's not the case. 

I ordered a vanilla shake the last time I came here and it was green. When I asked about it, the guy at the window stated it was \"St. Patrick's Day the day before, don't you know you days. It's vanilla, we gave you the right shake. Good bye!\" So I drove off upset. 

I wouldn't recommend this Chick-Fil-A to anyone. It surprises me that the Chick-Fil-A on Gilbert & Germann is so much more friendly and the food taste so much better and yet this one is completely the opposite. Shouldn't I expect the same from all Chick-Fil-As regardless of where they're located? Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The best location I have been to!

Food is very good , Clean restaurant . Very friendly staff .  

I absolutely love the chicken ! Go inside , have it fresh - you won't regret .

I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Would I recommend: Yes! I do recommend this place!
What I got: Now since I'm vegetarian i usually get a shake and waffle fries. I recently tried their vanilla iced coffee and it's amazing. Definitely going to start getting their coffee!
The hours: 6:30-10PM// closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"How can you not love chick fila - not like - there's no liking here...I mean  LOVE! 

Every single employee is so ridiculously friendly, nice and honestly (not fake) helpful.  They must either take really good care of their employees or somehow find a way to still get good people that want to be nice to strangers as we are supposed to...maybe it's both and my faith in humanity is restored! 

And chicken - spicy chicken sandwich - craveable! 
Sweet tea - let's main line that into our blood stream. 
Lemonade - yes please - even the diet. 
Nuggets - by the trays - we do it a lot! 
And you know what it's all perfect. 

Each restaurant has community stuff and events separate to just them...so wonderful! 

I'm in - I'm all sweet tea'd up."}
{"text":"As a transplant from Texas, I was ecstatic they had come to Nevada.  After I finally made it here, I was again reminded why I love this place so much.  It's actually very simple.. Great Service, Fresh Food and the best lemonade in the world.  It was like a little piece of back home."}
{"text":"I was never big about this place til it opened in vegas/henderson. I instantly fell in love with the chick-fil-a sauce. Alot of us from work come here for our lunch spot. When they first opened we thought it we would have to wait forever but we were in and out so fast. The staff is always so pleasant and helpful. One time I was waiting for my hubby to meet me for dinner and a staff member came up to me and asked me if I wanted anything to drink. I lovvveee the spicy deluxe sandwich and the cookies and cream milkshake. Their breakfast options are also great. The ice coffee isn't all that but its good. I come here so often that I always get free treats on my app that gets scanned everytime I come here."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this review by saying I'm somewhat biased against chick-fil-a due to their practices with homosexual employees and their stance on that in general.

I had never been to one as there aren't any near me, but gave this a try during a work trip when asked to by my peers. Sold a bit of my soul, I'd say.

It was fast food, plain and simple. I was advised since I had not been to try their chicken nuggets, so I did as a meal.

I tried the polynesian sauce, ranch and chick-fil-a sauce. The polynesian was the best of the three, but didn't really change the fact that I was eating greasy chicken that didn't particularly impress me. The waffle fries were alright, but again, nothing earth shattering. The infamous chick-fil-a sauce honestly reminded me of Honey Mustard, though I didnt try their packets of honey mustard to compare.

At this location, the parking lot is also kind of a pain. Service was quick and the outdoor seating option was nice, but in the end, it's just fast food."}
{"text":"My experiences at Chick Fil A are usually good ones. I ordered a medium fruit cup with my meal this morning and when I got home and started eating it I noticed that there was a molding blueberry in there. It was very disgusting and I threw it away."}
{"text":"Not a very speedy location. Also, the intercom is Linda broken. Lady couldn't hear me like 3-4 times."}
{"text":"Lets all have a truth moment! Chick-fil-a is phenom. Whats unique about this location. The drive through is STUPID fast. I kid you not. Its the fastest drive through for fast food I've ever been through. I use the new iOS app and its even better because you get rewards when you eat there. Perfecto."}
{"text":"I do like their food. I like how the kid meals come with something educational instead of some piece of plastic junk. The only thing I would say is for the price, I think their portions could be a little bigger. I am always wanting just a couple more waffle fries."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! The employees are so sweet and helpful and our food always comes out so fast. Chick-fil-a is the best!!"}
{"text":"This Chick fil A is big, clean and has plenty of seating not to mention the indoor huge slide for the kiddos to play on. We like this location and the staff and managers are very friendly, they even will bring your food to the table so you don't have to stand and wait for it. We will be back there sooner than later. One of the best Chick fil A's I've been to in a while."}
{"text":"Prior to Chick-fil-A opening in town, I had never eaten it before. I was totally missing out though and now I freaking love this place! I don't like the ridiculously long lines the drive-thru always has though. Seriously it's always a 20 minute wait. Ain't nobody got time for that. Sometimes when they are super busy, there are employees on foot taking orders which helps expedite things. Speaking of employees, they are always super friendly here. They even greet you by your name which personalizes the whole experience. 

I really like the chickN minis they serve for breakfast. It's just their chicken nuggets on soft, buttery, mini yeast rolls. So bomb. If you get a combo it comes with hash browns and a coffee. I like their hash browns as well, and they are excellent dipped in the Chick-fil-A sauce. I have a serious obsession with the the CFA sauce. It's amazing. I'd eat it on a shoe it's that good. They are generous with the sauces and usually will give you how ever many you ask for. 

For lunch or dinner I enjoy the regular chicken sandwich. It's a real chicken breast, white meat and juicy, on a buttery bun with pickles. Recently they introduced a new drink called the Frosted Sunrise. It's just orange juice and vanilla soft-serve, but it's super goood. I love this place and will continue to stop by whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Usually great! Off today. I ordered chicken minis and I thought the bread was usually biscuits. The bread they were on was doughy and could be squished flat with fingers. Coffee was really dark and gross. The bacon was yummy and crispy and the chicken was great"}
{"text":"Poor service. Incorrect or mixed orders every time I've been here. Lots of people standing around. One time I was the only person at the counter and had to wait 4 minutes, while the two employees finished their conversation. I love Chick-fil-A, but this one is infuriating."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone on this post. This is the worst cfa I have EVER been to and it sucks because it's right by my house.

I have been multiple times. ALWAYS painfully slow! Each time I've been it's at least 20 minute wait! One time I was sick between people and sat there for 45 minutes! The food quality is not to cfa standards as well, cold, miniature sized pieces of chicken don't even cover half of the sandwich, wrong items, even my milkshake was a liquid mess. 

The worst part besides how slow is the service of the employees, they are all rude, never smile or say my please or any of the normal cfa service. They honestly do not care that you wait for 30 minutes they go about talking and joking and just standing around? There's a line completely all the way around the building and your moving like a slug. It's not a welcoming environment it's like they all hate their job! The employees even argue and yell at each other on multiple occasions in the dining area and the drive thru.

YOU HAVE ONE... I REPEAT 1 STAR ON YELP TOM ELLINGTON! DO YOU NOT THINK IT IS TIME TO HIRE NEW MANAGEMENT!!! 

Also I can't believe CHick-fil-a as a corporation is allowing this nonsense to go on. This is horrible for the chick-Fil-a name to have such an establishment!"}
{"text":"The worst CFA I have EVER visited!  The service is always terrible, the drive through line takes forever and inside is no better.  The staff is not as friendly as other locations and the food is not up to CFA standards.  Save yourself the hassle and drive the extra 15 minutes to the Belmont location!"}
{"text":"Anna Brittain is complaining that the bread is soggy on the spicy chicken sandwich uh oh"}
{"text":"I generally love this place, but this time it just wasn't great. Not bad, but not great. Part of this is my fault. I usually get the Grilled Chicken Sandwich meal, but today I got a Cobb Salad because I didn't want to gorge myself with those amazing fries. The salad tasted like it had been refrigerated for a bit, but I will say the chicken was yummy.

Out of all the locations I would say that this location had the least enthusiastic workers, but they were friendly enough. I must give kudos to one gentleman who picked up my tray. He had a genuine smile and was super sweet. He not only asked to remove my tray, he came back awhile later to ask if he could refill my drink. This is the type of customer service that is amazing and appreciated!!! 

My service nor food were bad, just not awesome with exception to the older gentleman who was so nice."}
{"text":"No complaints here!
This is the most tasty and moist chicken sandwhich I've ever had when it comes to \"fatstfood\", mind you we only have limited options where I live.
The Deluxe Sandwich and waffle patato fries were so good we went back several times and each time it was the same great quality!
I particularly love the Chic-Fil-A signature sauce."}
{"text":"If you are ever in the Calgary airport and get those hunger pains. Check this place out its a gem. I had the chicken burger combo. Decent burger and killer fries."}
{"text":"Worse chic fil a I have ever been in.  Only one I have been in where the workers were down right rude.  Only one I have ever gotten stale food.  Got a chicken biscuit and the biscuit was so old you could actually knock it on the table and it sounded like you were hitting it with a rock.  Some supervisors need to look at this location carefully!   Would never recommend this location. Go somewhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"Great nuggets and chicken sandwiches plus the staff is always super friendly. A little pricey for fast food but quality and service is there so it makes u feel like ur getting a little more for your buck. Only 4 stars right now because since it's so new right now it takes forever to get your order in and get your food. I suspect after a while the wait will be under control."}
{"text":"Terrible experience at Eastern & Ione location today.

After driving half hour to get to this location and waiting about 20 mins in line I recieved my order.

I requested light ice in my drink as stated on my reciept. My drink was full of ice, I asked the associate who gave me my order if it was light ice he said \"did you ask for light ice\" I said yes. He handed it back to someone who told a girl \"he wants almost no ice\" they handed me back a cup with no ice at all. At this point I told him again and he tried to send my drink back again and I just said can I have a cup of ice to solve the issue. After driving off I noticed my container of large fries was not even full. I went back to the location & showed this to the manager Daniel who agreed this is not how it should have looked. He apologized and said they have been very busy but didn't offer me anything to fix this, not even a full container of fries- at this point is was almost 20 mins after getting my food so of course it's all cold by now. I tried to call back 5 times to see if I could get the contact info for the operator and none of my calls were answered. 

This is not the type of service I am used to at Chickfila after being a customer of several years.

Especially not a manager that agrees that my order was incorrect and doent even offer to make it right. I spent over 2 hours driving here dealing with this and driving home. Definitely not worth all of my time and efforts."}
{"text":"This Restaurant is staffed by some of the nicest people anywhere. The food is good but it is the little things that the people do... like offer to refill your drink... that really set this place apart."}
{"text":"Still absolutely in love with Chick-Fil-A and this location is no exception to the wonderful service you're used to. From fast friendly service, to a high quality of food (not typical of fast food places) this place always delivers. 

First off, being one of only three locations in Vegas it is ALWAYS busy. I repeat, ALWAYS busy. Now that we've gotten this out of the way, I can assure you that even if it is busy. You will receive your food in a timely fashion (with little to no errors, I myself have yet to experience any issues with any of my orders and this is not my first time at this location). So keep cool - you don't need to worry about long lines or not being able to devour some delicious chicken quickly. 

Now as far as what to eat goes, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My personal favorites are the grilled chicken sandwich (not the club!) and the spicy chicken sandwich (comes with cheese, so good). And, you MUST, and I mean MUST top them both with some delectable Chick-Fil-A sauce. This is the best way to enjoy either of these menu items. With this lovely meal, you also need to ensure you order their fresh squeezed lemonade. It is the perfect balance of tart and sweet that is truly thirst quenching."}
{"text":"I've only visited this location once.  I ordered the baked chicken nuggets, a medium fry, and the number 1 which is the chicken sandwich combo.  The fries were not fresh and the nuggets tasted old.  They looked nothing like the nuggets in the commercial.  The whole experience was disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I rarely eat at Chick-fil-A, and of course, the afternoon I chose to do so they skimped out on my 3 piece tenders. The lunch rush hadn't even hit yet, whoever was packing up my meal just chose to stick a wimpy, brittle looking tender in my bag, as if that's what I paid $5 for."}
{"text":"I've been slightly disappointed with every location that isn't Scottsdale and Mayo. I guess I don't mind driving across town for...
Okay, that was GOING to be my review until I realized this location (And the Deer Valley and I17 location) mess my order up most of the time. Well, Deer Valley is more messy, but how can Scottsdale be so spot on with their services and these other locations just...aren't? The service is SO great at Scottsdale and Mayo that when an employee saw if my fries weren't crispy or \"well done\" they would ask for a remake! It's that simple Chick fil a, THAT'S what makes exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Night shift is horrible just left and went to canes instead waited in line for 10 min while 2 employees sat there ordering for 10 min chit chatting with co workers and there's 8 people In line. I came here because service is suppose to be fast. Night shifts Manager needs to be fired"}
{"text":"This chick fil a is becoming like most chick fil a resteraunts. Customer service is going down and they did not even get my order correct! The black girl and the Latino guy in the drive thru were so busy trying to keep the line moving that they did not offer a smile or greeting or anything other than a question of what I ordered. And whatever happened to the words \"My pleasure?\"  One star is for the taste of the food and the other star is for the price. That's it"}
{"text":"This chick fil a is awesome!!! The food is always cooked how it should, everyone is nice to you, and the restaurant is always super clean."}
{"text":"This Chick Fil A is awful. The last 3 times I have been here I have gotten soggy fries that are undercooked. How do you consistently mess up fries?? I love chick fil A but this location sucks. I've learned my lesson and I just have to drive up to North Scottsdale to get my fix."}
{"text":"Went to ChickFilA for the very first time and got the chicken tenders and comes with waffle fries!! Very tasty for fast food! Also had great customer service and the inside was very clean!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. From the people who work here all the way down to the food. Since they opened ive been in almost every other week. Good quality fast food. If you are looking for healthy alternatives this is the place for you too. Plenty of options on the menu for all times of the day! Love that they are open very early in the morning. Oh also this place is always clean. Employees work hard to keep people happy. This facility is an A+!! I cant remember how I lived without this place lol"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open and I am so happy it finally did. The hospitality here is way off the charts. I was waiting outside for my food when one of the workers Yohfed came up to me and asked \"may I refresh your beverage?\". My jaw nearly dropped. I didn't think I heard him right initially. The last time I was asked that way was when I went with my husband to the steakhouse. My food was delivered by Gloria and when we spoke she had the utmost respect for the owner. This you don't hear this everyday. As far as compliments go, that says a lot about the owner. I feel like i am at a restaurant with brynn and everyone coming up to us and if anything else is needed.  I am so coming back here with my family again. Their prices are comparable to Carl's Jr. but the fact that they are happy to see you. This place is packed but they do not neglect on making you feel welcome or making sure your needs are met. Yayyyyy found a new place to enjoy eating out without breaking the bank. Oh Our cashier jasmine was awesome and full of energy too."}
{"text":"Was heading back to CA after a few days in Vegas and wanted to get a quick bite to eat before heading home. Saw the drive thru line and it was at least 15 to 20 cars long. So we went inside, waited in line for maybe 3 minutes, got our order taken, then waiting 5 mins till our food arrived at our table
 If you come here, would recommend eating inside and avoid the drive thru."}
{"text":"U know usually I don't have a problem with you guys, but today at the drive thru was a nightmare. Your little kid like girl working the drive thru around 1230pm was a full on bitch. First of all i wanted chick fil a minis.  She rudely stated bfast ended at 1030am, you can't order that. Second of all, I decided on another reward,  and she said what else will you like?? Very forcibly! I said nothing,  then she rudely asked cash or card? I said it's free !!!! Then my phone wouldn't scan so she rudely said it's just not working! Lose the attitude and QUIT HIRING DUMB DON'T GIVE A SHIT high school students.  Eastern ave location much better!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love chick fil a. Great food, love how your christian owned, closed sundays and believe in traditional marriage. I will give you guys all of my business."}
{"text":"I love this Chick-Fil-A location. 
The food is consistent and delicious. 
The store is always clean. 
I love their plastic mats, and clean high chairs. 

Above all the play area is always clean. There are purell wipes everywhere, and you can tell they take pride in the appearance of this store.

From the mom perspective, this location has a diaper station in the bathroom which is incredible."}
{"text":"Love this chicken. And even with the crazy lines since they just opened here in Las Vegas it was worth the long lines. Best fries ever!"}
{"text":"I'm used to high quality but my last visit was not so great. It was a long wait, ok worth it if the end product is100% the soda was completely flat, the waffle fries were very underdone. The chicken was decent and the Mac n cheese was good. Paid out 24.00 but half the meal not so great."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken biscuit is really addicting. Since the quality is top notch I am very okay with that!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that this location opened up. I love chick fil a and this location makes it convenient to come eat more.  Their quality is so worth every dollar spent. Not only are the lunch items amazing but the breakfast spicy chicken biscuit is just so great. I didnt know about it until my friend told me about it and I was not disappointing at all!"}
{"text":"food = exactly as expected and came incredibly quick, like before we were done payinh quick

cleanliness = nearly immaculate

employees = friendliest employees I've ever encountered at a fast food chain. even the manager came over and asked us how everything was, and then at the end of the meal, he took my tray for me!

overall it was a very pleasant experience. fries could have been a little crispier and a pump ketchup would have been nice instead of the packets. but I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Good chicken but too expensive for the portion. I always buy the small try of chicken nuggets, but the tray keeps getting smaller."}
{"text":"For me, Chick-Fil-A has set the gold standard for what fat food dining should be. The food is always great, the restaurants are always clean, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. This new location in Wexford follows through with those ideas. This may, in fact the best Chick-Fil-A I have ever visited.

For starters, it's nice to not have to drive through the ridiculous snarl of Cranberry, PA traffic only to have to battle it out again at that area's location. The Wexford location has a double drive-thru and more than ample parking. I've yet to see the drive-thru come anywhere close to the craziness that the Cranberry location creates daily.

The inside of this Chick-Fil-A is immaculate and looks different from all the others I've visited. Instead of the ordering station being in the center and towards the back of the restaurant, this one is right up front as you walk in with a huge dining room to the right. There's even an extra condiment station in the center of the dining room in addition to the one close by to the cashiers. The tables are really nice, and I like the suspended light fixtures, which gives the place a modern yet inviting touch.

The food is terrific. If you love Chick-Fil-A, you'll continue to love it here. The staff here is perfect, always friendly and looking like they're enjoying their work and having a good time. They'll always go above and beyond for the customer to make their dining experience as great as it can be. The other day I stopped by to pick up an order I placed on their mobile app (which is also fantastic, by the way) and there was a short wait for the fries as quite a few people had come through and placed some orders and they needed to make fresh batches of fries. It took about three to five minutes to wait, which was more than acceptable. Upon opening my bag when I got home, I saw that they had placed a card for a free eight pack of nuggets or three chicken strips for the wait. Totally unnecessary, but this is exactly the sort of great customer care that Chick-Fil-A employs that easily gets people to come back.

Needless to say, I'm a regular here and basically have been since this location opened. So if you're in the area and don't want to deal with the craziness of Cranberry, there's always plenty of room here. Great food, great service. It's Chick-Fil-A and you love it."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. I had never eaten 
Chick-Fil-A before and I have to say it was pretty damn good for some chikN. They close at 10 and it was almost 9:30 when we got there, but they were still really busy. The inside looked packed so we hit the drive thru. It was about 20 cars deep, but everyone told me it would go quick and they were not wrong! There were workers standing outside and taking orders and collecting payment so that definitely helped move things along. We waited about 10 minutes to get our food after ordering, but that's because we ordered well done fries. We ordered a regular chicken sandwich, spicy chicken sandwich, 2 large waffle fries, 2 sweet teas, a 12 piece nuggets and a large cookies n cream shake. Total for everything was $26. 

The regular chicken sandwich was tasty, but a bit dry. I didn't realize it came with no sauce. The chicken is a real breast and it's a decent size. The bun was soft and buttery. It wasn't until I ate the nuggets that I tried the liquid crack AKA Chick-Fil-A sauce, and I thought they should put that on the sandwich. Whyyy they don't do that is beyond me. A buttery bun, juicy breast and crack sauce? Bomb! What are they waiting for??

The waffle fries I had asked to be well done, but they weren't at all. Still tasty though! I plan to eat more chikN here whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. We don't eat here often but when we do we realize why we like it so much."}
{"text":"Usually I would give Chick-fil-a a good grade, however my visit today was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. My meal was $5.59, so I gave the cashier $10.60. I took time to make sure I had that exact amount and I gave it to her, but maybe she was being carless or even maybe lazy and she put it in the system wrong. So I got a complete different amount of money. I didn't  say anything because it's not that big of a deal, however maybe if she payed more attention, I could've got the right amount of currency. My food also took a while to come out, and it fell apart when I started eating it. This was not a good chick-fil-a experience."}
{"text":"While the service is usually superior, my large order placed 3 weeks ago is not ready and no one moving with any sense of urgency on this busy workday"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  The inside appeared nice, but I did have the time to dine in.  The food seemed a little overpriced for fast food.  The food was ok.  In all fairness to Chick-Fil-A, I never ate here as a kid, so I have no fond childhood memories to draw from.  Several of my friend that love this chain have loved it since childhood.  I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about over this chain."}
{"text":"Welcome to Vegas Chick-Fil-A! 
I'm so happy my favorite fast food restaurant is finally here! I've been here more than a dozen times (half of which I forget to check in on yelp!) and not once have I been disappointed. The staff is amazing, always smiling and eager to please. Never had an order wrong. I've finally started to branch out and try new things on the menu. I've been a faithful nuggets or strips person but recently tried the spicy chicken sandwich. So good! I love that the chicken is never dry. It's always moist and full of flavor and just freakin delicious. And each chicken has its own unique flavor- the strips taste different from the nuggets- which both taste different from the sandwiches. This is my go to spot any time of day whenever I'm out and want to grab a bite to eat! I only wish I could get my hands on one of the little plush Cow dolls!"}
{"text":"I love me them waffle fries. This location is ALWAYS busy but they seem to some how manage through the rush. Recently they've been promoting their app. So, I used their app. The confirmation email and the app said to stay in the car and someone will being your food out to you and that was part of the food order and incentive to order from the app. Well, I waited about 15 mins and no one came out. So, I came in and the person explained that there's some confusion with the app. The aap says WAIT AND THEY WILL BRING IT TO YOU. That's actually the only time I've had an issue. Overall, the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Best Chicken around dont look at this like a KFC as it is more nuggets and sandwiches than legs and wings!

Adults and kids both love Chick Fil A  they have great a sandwich and nuggets. 
Chicken soup is even good with fresh white meat which I have everytime we come!

Shakes are great too!"}
{"text":"So glad this restaurant is finally in the 702! Even though it's very busy with the grand opening; it's worth it. I enjoyed the kids menu."}
{"text":"I was happy to see CLT finally got something new and fresh. This Chick-fil-A is a great location with good food and great service. You can find it right in the main Concourse at CLT behind security."}
{"text":"I usually go to this location, but tonight was the last time! I went through the drive thru and ordered an 8 count meal. I get home and there's only 5 nuggets in the box!!!!! Clearly I paid for 8 nuggets so where the hell are my other 3?! THEN I called up to the store about 5x and each time, the phone rang and rang. There was no voicemail or nothing. So now I'm stuck eating 5 nuggets, which is NOT my complete order AND there's no one to talk to regarding this situation. Being that today is Saturday, they're closed tomorrow. I will definitively be back up there on Monday and will speak to a manager. This is ridiculous and I won't let this slide!"}
{"text":"Dry food, cold sandwich, forgot all of the sauces which is the best part. Didn't include salad dressing for the salad or the crispy things for the salad. The salad tasted like a mcdonalds chemical filled salad. I love Chick-fil-A, but this one should be avoided."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A but this location falls short in so many ways during the breakfast hours. 
Customer service is lacking in knowledge and politeness. 
Accuracy in order: I went to this location 5 times in two weeks and 3 times the order was wrong and or it took 10 minutes to get the order.  I do have a special order; well wait, is getting a grilled chicken instead of fried really a special order? Plus the other days either the bagel was either burnt or not toasted at all. 
Serving size: Compared to other Chick-fil-A they are skimpy with their egg portions.  
I gave them 2 stars because I Love Chick-fil

Update: stopped going here since my last review until today. Nothing has changed food is great service & ability to get my regular order correct still SUCK!"}

I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience and the staff are absolutely incredible. I love the chicken nuggets, man I crave them daily, and don't get me started with their waffle fries!!"}

 You cannot get a better product that taste this good with the service you get anywhere! They're so friendly and personable I absolutely love Chick-fil-A!"}

The chicken deluxe was the best sandwich I have had in a long time. you can tell that the smiles are genuine and they are truely greatful for my patronage."}
{"text":"The service today really was disappointing and slow.  They only had one person that worked the cash register in the whole place and she was also restocking which took away from her register duties.  It took several mins just to get an acknowledgement and several more to place an order.  Funny thing I was the only person in line.  Normally, we never have any issues with this location."}

I drove through for a combo (by the way I recently discovered your superfood salad and have found my new favorite) and took my card out to pay, only to be told that you guys were taking care of it! Talk about turning a frown upside down. Thank you!!!! Life is good."}

Great customer service. 
Stellar hospitality."}

Another girl came to the front to take orders and asked the person behind me if he needed anything, I was ignored again. And again."}
{"text":"Service is great, no matter how long the lines inside or in the drive through may be!  Not to mention that I no longer have to wait for a trip to California to get one of my absolute favorite sandwiches!!

{"text":"We got our food tonight and the fries were nice and hot but our chicken was cold like it had been sitting there all day. And the last time we went there they forgot to give us one of our entrees. We drove back and they did not seem to care"}
{"text":"Another great example of this fine franchise. They make delicious chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets, and my favorite- the cookies and cream milkshakes. 
What sets chick-fil-a apart however, is the customer service. The young lady taking my order was so incredibly friendly and helpful. I also had another employee visit my table twice to ask how we were doing, if we needed anything, and if we needed drink refills. Combine service like that with delicious food and a fun place for families, and you've got yourself a five star fast food experience.
This is a great restaurant in a nice location, just be prepared for long waits if you're using the drive-thru. Just stop on in and enjoy the environment."}
{"text":"I wanted to give no stars for the Frosted Lemonade.  It's $2.91 for a SMALL!  Way overpriced!  And it's not even good.  I went out for a peach milkshake craving to learn this location is no longer serving it -- as of today. Very disappointed.  The guy at the drive they said, \"we serve the peppermint shake in December.\" (I told him I don't like that one.) This is August. How is a peppermint milkshake in December going to fix my peach craving tonight?  I will be going to the one at work tomorrow to get my peach milkshake before they stop serving it too."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is great.  I have been to many Chick-Fil-A's and the food is always great.  I had a Spicy Chicken Sandwich Combo meal and it was excellent.  

The reason for a 4 star rating is a couple gaffes with the order:

My wife ordered a Southwestern Chicken Salad with an Iced Tea and they brought the wrong salad.

I ordered a Combo meal with a lemonade.  The lemonade was charged extra, so I ended up paying for 2 drinks to go along with my combo meal.

The restaurant is very new and clean.  There is a play area for children under 54 inches that has an awesome soundproof glass entrance to it.  We were sitting right next to the play area and were not distracted by the kids playing in the play area.

Overall we enjoyed our visit;."}
{"text":"First time at a Chik FilA  ever.
In a pinch for food while running around town.
Ordered a cool wrap.
Paid six dollars.
This \"wrap\" tasted worse than what I imagine the sandwiches in gas station coolers taste like.
Salty, non food bright orange cheese shreds with cold grilled chicken by-product pieces and lettuce all wrapped in a dry tortilla. 

Truly disgusting. 
I thought about returning it for my money back.
Threw it away instead."}
{"text":"Great people and great food!!!  Always positive customer focus!!!   Thank you!!  We had the breakfast items and they were perfect."}
{"text":"I was in this property for the first time on 02//27/18. I ordered three (3) filet no buns. One of the chicken breasts was half the size of the other two. I asked a supervisor to look at this small chicken breast. I told him this was totally unacceptable! He did not offer to replace the breast. And he let my food get cold as it was exposed to the elements as I was showing to him the size difference. Supervisor name was Terrell,he stated \" would not remake the three breasts.\" He gave me two (2) options eat the three cold chicken breasts or he would process a refund. As I walked out of the store #03687 I walked back up closer to this store to get Terrell's name and the Chick-fil-A Owner/Operator
Dave Taplin, was walking out of his store and he shouted \"don't come back to my store we will call the cops.\" DO NOT EVER PATRONIZE THIS CHICK-FIL-A on South Eastern and Ione. Supervisor Terrell &
Owner/Operator Dave Taplin, our total ASSWIPES Extremely poor business men."}
{"text":"As with any Chick-Fil-A, this place is ALWAYS crowded, especially on Saturdays.  And as with any Chick-Fil-A, the service is phenomenal no matter how crowded it is.  

Yea its a notch pricey-er than your standard fast food spot (esp. their breakfast) , but the TASTE and Quality are a notch above your standard fast food fare as well.

The chicken-tenders are awesome.  The milkshakes (STRAWBERRY) are amazing.  I'm a huge fan of the chicken breakfast burrito and the CHICKEN MINIS  

...and always remember; Chick-Fil-A is ALWAYS CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Brand new to my town and everyone loves it. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and their food is delicious. It's very reasonably priced and is definitely a place I look forward going back to."}
{"text":"Ate at this Chik Fil A yesterday for breakfast. The chicken pieces on the Chik Fil A biscuits i had were very small and did not taste like normal Chik Fil A chicken that we all know and love. 

Quite simply- not up to the Chik Fil A standard."}
{"text":"First time eating at chick-fil-a! Great experience. And Nia was a great help and very nice. Thank you."}
{"text":"The Skinny: for fast food, the chicken is pretty darn good (4), the ambience is pretty nice, very family friendly, great service for fast food joint (4), value: for the quality, it is excellent value (4).

We love Chick-fil-a. The food quality for fast food is great. 

For me, I love their cool wrap - a grilled chicken flatbread wrap with vegetables and cheese. Pair it with the avocado lime ranch dressing, you got yourself some good eats for fast food. The salads are also pretty good as well.

My toddler prefers the grilled nuggets and is a huge fan of the fruit cup. I like that they have mini board books for kids under 3. I also like the kind of toys they include in the kids meal. Clearly, their toys are specifically currated to be fun yet educational at the same time. 

The hubs is totally into the original chicken sandwich with the honey BBQ sauce. He also loves the spicy chicken sandwich as well. He finds the fried chicken crispy yet retaining it's moist inner texture. The seasoning is not overly aggressive which is nice for younger palates like my toddler.

We usually always get the sweet tea and the lemonade. Both taste nearly home made. The lemonade especially is worth the extra surcharge.

Things you can skip? Personally, I am not a fan of their soups. They taste like a slightly fancier version of Campbell's.

The environment is exceptionally clean for a fast food chain. Fresh flowers on the table, specialized disposable placemats for kids, plentiful highchairs - these are all elements of a family sort of place.

The drive thru is always busy but there is always seats available for dining inside the restaurant. Weekends are always really busy and it is not atypical to see a line put the door during lunch hours. Luckily, they are staffed quite well so things generally run smoothly. The staff is usually helpful and polite.

Given all these factors, this place gets a four started review."}
{"text":"What in the world Chick-fil-a!! I use to love coming here, but this is just too much! Ordered the four piece chicken meal and all of the chicken pieces were burnt and Tasted like rubber, and my fries were over cooked. I can't even continue to express this disappointed.

The staff was really friendly, this review is for their lack of cooking skills.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to cook some chicken! Come on guys get it together."}
{"text":"I had heard about how amazing this 'fast food' restaurant was for a while now, but I didn't fully appreciate it until one moved in a few blocks away from where I work. My co-worker basically forced us to go around the opening and he seemed to be a seasoned pro, knowing what specialty sauces to order and all. I kept it simple and ordered a cheeseburger (psych!), I had a chicken sandwich (they only serve chicken related products).

I have since returned and will admit that I am shamefully addicted to their Chick-fil-A sauce! Seriously, why do you have it coveted behind the counter, just expect that I will want it and don't just give me two. I want more of that stuff.

As it goes for customer service, they get it. At first when they had someone come to our table to check on us I was a little put off... but then she refilled my beverage and started to enjoy my experience that much more! Even down to the small detail of asking for my name in the drive-thru menu and then when I pull around to the window greeting me by my name (and sometimes being impressed before I realize that I gave them my name).

Oh yes, I am a fan and the hype is all true!"}
{"text":"I felt very welcome and the staff was very helpful. Dania was very patient because we have never been there. Great job!"}

{"text":"I've been here four or five times, it's exactly what you have come to expect, it's tasty chicken and of course it is their pleasure. I haven't had them mess up my order yet, and the staff is always incredibly helpful. I just can't give a restaurant 5/5 that isn't open on Sunday when I'm craving their breakfast, it always is on a Sunday. I know it's not this particular stores fault, its corporate policy but come on man I want some chicken biscuits it's 2017!"}
{"text":"Might be good if the food was hot!  It was barely warm.  Quick service but to achieve that they are obviously cooking the food too far ahead.  I would rather wait a few minutes and have it hot!  On the plus side a full sized 
greaseless chicken breast, fresh lettuce and a thick slice of tomato.  The waffle fries are a nice switch but again barely warm.  Also ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which for me could have a lot more kick but for others might be just right.  And be prepared for the over kill on the employee 'sweetness'.  Sorry but too much of it and it doesn't mean anything as it is very put on..no sincerity.  Overall the food quality was excellent and I will give it another try.  Perhaps today was just an off day on the food temperature ????"}

{"text":"When I saw the sign that a Chick-Fil-A was opening in the Biltmore area I was jumping up and down for joy.  Chick-Fil-A is by far my favorite fast food restaurant.  The closest Chick-Fil-A was 20 miles from us house.  :(  

I really like the new layout of the restaurant and it is pretty cool to be able to see the kitchen when you are eating your food.  Also I love how there is always someone at the door greeting you with a big smile on their face and that the line went really quick to order your food.   

Last but not least, I order the spicy chicken sandwich with fries and a coke zero.  After all it is my favorite sandwich.

Thank you Chick-Fil-A for opening a store in the Biltmore area, if you have not been to Chick-Fil-A before then you should definitely go.  They are always really friendly, quick and hopefully."}

I got a spicy chicken sandwich and I can't even describe how perfect it was. I have attached a picture to prove it! Very great food and worth the money! Prices are average but I find the value to be remarkable!"}

I'll just say, there's better Chick-Fil-A's in and around the Charlotte area.  I'm not saying this place is bad, or that I wouldn't go here.  I AM saying that I have developed high standards for my Chick-Fil-As over the years and sometimes this location doesn't quite measure up.  

Main Issue: The breakfast burritos are NEVER made fresh.  It always feels like the burrito has been sitting under a heat lamp for 10-15min, and they are just grabbing it and sticking it in a bag and handing it to me.  Yes its quick and efficient.  But the burrito is lacking in every way - the shell is soggy and falling apart, there seems to be little to no cheese, and its small compared to others I've had at different locations.  

Otherwise, the service is decent, and the interior is what you'd expect from a Chick-Fil-A, clean, neat and orderly.     

Will I be right back here tomorrow for breakfast?  Yes, of course, I will! Although, I'm not holding my breath on any improvements to that burrito..."}
{"text":"if you've been to a Chick-Fil-A you know what you can expect - great service, great food, a select variety of condiments, and an overall clean friendly atmosphere, and the Chick-Fil-A @ Davis Lake doesn't disappoint.

This is often a stop for me on the way to work.  I have a few staple menu items:  the chicken/sausage breakfast burrito, chicken, the chicken egg/cheese on a multigrain bagel, and the famous Chick-Fil-A minis.  All of these items are filling, tasty and are consistent each and every time you order them.

The service is nothing short of excellent.  The attendants are always polite, courteous and friendly.  Furthermore, in some strange way, the people that work here feel somewhat authentic in their politeness.

The parking lot can sometimes be tricky to navigate, but nothing to crazy.

The only downside about this place is that it can be somewhat pricey.  But the fact that this location regularly has free breakfast give aways more than makes up the pricey menu.

If you like Chick-Fil-A you'll be perfectly satisfied with this location."}
{"text":"I really like this chic-fil-a for breakfast before heading to Concord Mills. 

Food is straight, service is always great as well. What's not to like. 

The only time can ever encounter issues here is on Saturdays when it gets packed out. And never forget, they are always closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"Brand new location, really nice, great service, great food, chicken nuggets are my fav!"}
{"text":"Incredible service, so clean and friendly! Thanks for helping weary travelers!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night is kids night. Great time to pick up on single moms. Plus I love their lemonade."}
{"text":"Being from California and always traveling to Las Vegas I am so thankful there is one out here! This location provides decent service and Chick-fil-A is always bomb regardless of location."}
{"text":"Food was spot on and quick. Staff was amazing and friendly. An older woman named Shirley stopped by our table and in the kindest manner asked if she could take our trays or refresh our drinks. She was adorable. Shirley for prez"}
{"text":"Very very happy with our decision to come here. The staff were incredibly friendly and beyond polite. My chicken sandwich looks just like it does on tv, and tastes even better! Not something you see much at many fast food joints. Will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"For a fast food chicken sandwich, it is very good.  I definitely give it credit for that.  I went on a Saturday at about 6:30pm.   The line was pretty short and went fast...  took about 2 minutes to order.   Staff was friendly and helpful.   They have a whole lot of people working.  Like I said, the sandwich was very good.  My mind wasn't blown or anything but I would go back if I was in the mood.  Doubt I'll have any major cravings for it.   They serve waffle fries, which are good, not great.   Soda was good but don't like how you have to go to the counter for refills.   For what it is, it's very good.   Not as magical as I would have hoped.   I think it was $7.35 for a spicy chicken meal for anyone that's curious."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Cashier was very polite. A lady came to our table to ask if we needed refills. Everyone that walked in was greeted by someone. Food was great."}
{"text":"This location does a wonderful job with customer service. They make sure the customer is always happy and are eager to resolve any issues their customers may have."}
{"text":"Everyone is pretty much on the same page. 


This place serves delicious food

Extremely friendly and nice 

Super clean and presentable 

It just sucks that the close on Sundays. 


It's refreshing to feel like employees are being overly nice, simple because e aren't used to this kindness everyday. I love this place. My kid loves the play areas and food. 

Love that they have hand sanitizing wipes as you enter the play area. 


Food was delicious. Never fails. Sauces galore. Chicken done right. Not close to home but don't mind the drive. If you haven't tried you're missing out and I'm sorry about that!"}
{"text":"Employees are always a pleasure to talk to. They go out of their way to help you. It's refreshing to stop by and see people happy to help you and go above and beyond for you. I truly enjoy stopping by. Food is amazing and service always makes it better."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive through, ordered tenders weren't even hot, must have been sitting for a while... tons of kids working, falling a over eachother, perhaps they should  pay more attention to the food. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I am not a fast food guy at all. But on the rare occasion where I feel like hitting a drive through it's going to be Chick-fil-A (mandela?) 

This organization has established a great culture or respect, courtesy, professionalism, and team work. The employees are so nice. It's a stark contrast from the Taco Bells and McDonalds. 

Great work! I would rather someone stand up for their faith and have exemplary service... than be down for everything and try to fight me through the drive through window."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for \"dates\" with my 2 1/2 year-old son.  The staff is ALWAYS courteous and friendly and they go out of their way more often than not.  The last time the woman at the register gave my son a stuffed cow and then later a balloon - that made his day!!!

They have great family-themed events (Pirate & Princess night, Mom's Morning Out, etc., Mommy & Son Date Night to name a few) and we really just love going there.   They bring your food to your table, which is great when you have your hands full with a little one!!  The bathrooms are always clean and the food is of course delicious!

The only complaint I would have is that a lot of older kids seem to end up in the play area.  We went a few weeks ago and there were kids in there (unsupervised) that were at least 9 or 10 that were climbing up the slide, on top of the slide, running around and just being really rambunctious.  Granted, kids are kids and they were just having fun, but a little girl was coming down the slide when one of the boys was climbing up and she ran right into him.  We ended up leaving because my son started trying to copy the little boys and it was just getting a little too rough.  Not sure what the solution could be. Perhaps they could be a bit better about patrolling who goes in to play? This has only been the case a few times and has not deterred us from returning. 

Overall, the best Chick-Fil-A in our area!!"}
{"text":"I remember Chik-fil-A tasting better and being a better value, seeing as they are more expensive that other fast food chains. This location leaves something to be desired. Waffle fry containers come half-full; there's a really wilted piece of lettuce on every sandwich I've gotten from here; and the chicken itself tastes soggily like paper wrapper it seems to have been sitting in for hours. The staff are nice, but the food has been sickening to eat and leaves me feeling sick the rest of the day whenever I take a chance thinking it will be different."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, typical for a Chick Fil A. Staff was friendly and welcoming. Food came quickly and was delicious."}
{"text":"The Afton Ridge Chick-Fil-A location is the best fast-food restaurant I've ever visited, hands down.  They consistently deliver an incredible customer experience and have what I could consider to be the most customer-centric team in Concord.  I worked near this location nearly 2 years and visited often, but haven't been in the area in nearly a year.  My visit today proves that nothing has changed... it is the same, consistently incredible, experience I had become accustomed to.  The team is so dedicated to their community, and it shows in everything they do."}
{"text":"After going back several times looks like they are over their growing pains and are now going full force and are that wonderful \"chick\" we all love"}
{"text":"This place is a ZOO... but is run like a finely oiled machine.  Does the business here ever slow down?  But I still walked in and within about 4 minutes- my order was taken & paid for by one of the managers that were 'lending a hand' and taking orders.  Manager Rick took my order and right next to him was Manager Dennis who was just as friendly.  Keep kicking ass guys and the 5's will keep coming in.  By the way- it was about 80 degrees out so I ordered the grilled chicken wrap with the Avocado Lime Ranch Dressing and it was the BOMB...!  So cool, refreshing and PERFECT on my wrap.  Thanks for the suggestion Mgr Rick."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A, especially their fries. But one thing I don't understand is why they don't post their closing hours anywhere.  I literally searched it doesn't sites and none of them had a time for that location."}
{"text":"Can't complain to much, food is always good. Tonight i went through the drive through and they took my order, everything was good until we got to the window and they told us they were out of Wraps after we had ordered and paid, lame but it happens overall good food and nice staff"}
{"text":"***** you see those extra 5 stars? That's because this establishment earns a 10 out of 5 in my book. Other Chick Fil As take note- THE PEOPLE WANT SPICY BACK. Not only does this spot still have the spicy chicken biscuit, they served us fabulous crispy hash browns and exquisite lemonade. Our food was given to us with a smile and friendly service. Awesome experience. Will return every chance I get for breakfast for the rest of my life. Amazing."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-a is by far my favorite fast food restaurant. Not only is the food good, but the staff is super friendly. I have never had a bad experience. I went this morning for breakfast. After waiting for my food the manager gave me my order along with a gift card for a free sandwich. He immediately apologized for my wait. I didn't think the wait was long at all, but I always appreciate great customer service."}
{"text":"Well they have the best chicken. Food is always fresh. You can't get enough of the chik-fil-a Sauce. You pair your meal with the best fresh squeezed lemonade.  Love coming here with the kiddos. Nice plat area  Staff is always so helpful and courtesy. While I was waiting for my food. A manager came up and refilled my lemonade and checked on my order that's the kind of service I love. I usually ask for there name but it was busy but he did go above and beyond."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick meal on the way to Texas.  Servers were polite,  orders were accurate and filled promptly.   Food temperature was excellent.  Cobb salad was moist and fresh. Will make chik fil a my next stop today."}
{"text":"I absolutely love and support chick fil a and was please to hear they would open one by me. But since they have opened I have had nothing but problems, atleast on their drive thru. The first time I let it go. The second time I called to let them know, then the second time I was put on hold while an employee talked with another employee on how there was a complaining costumer in the line. At that point I was livid. Hung up and wrote a complaint on their website. Finally of weeks of not going there I finally decided to try it again and once again I was disappointed. The food is great it just seems like their costumer service sucks. There is no difference now from that place and mcdonalds next door"}
{"text":"FINALLY! So glad this is now open. No complaints here so far. Take into consideration that it's brand new and it's still being worked on. Staff is ALWAYS extremely helpful and nice. Food is amazing. This location saves me about a 45 minute round trip to the other location. Thank you."}
{"text":"I absolutely love chick-fil-A! Always friendly service and the best juiciest chicken sandwiches at any of their locations! I have never had a bad experience! Definitely one of the best fast food restaurants to ever exist!"}
{"text":"Excellent and very friendly staff.  I always enjoy stopping by for a bite to eat with my son.  Good food and I'm always pleased by the cleanliness of the place.  They do get busy during lunch and early dinner but the staff always manage to get the food out fast to my great appreciation.  Trust me, Any parent with a young child really appreciate fast and friendly service!
Highly recommend this place and the Spicy Chicken combo #2 with bacon!  Yum. . Oh yeah, combo #1 with bacon is good too."}
{"text":"Always busy but fast and efficient nevertheless! The chicken is nicely breaded, flavorful and juicy! You can get it grilled too. The chicken can be a sandwich, nuggets or on a salad- all good choices!"}
{"text":"I used to love this Chik fil A... 
then they brought in a new manager who I hardly ever see around. One of the times I actually did see him, he gave my husband and I attitude through the drive thru (completely shocked me considering it was my first bad experience here and it came from the manager).

all the employees are always so sweet, but it does seem like they were more attentive to customers before the switch of managers. Not sure if that's related."}
{"text":"If you are going to have fast food, this is a great place to have it.  We typically have the #7 - Grilled Chicken sandwich with a side salad and it does the trick.  Food has always been good and employees are anxious to make your experience a good one.  If you have young kids...Tuesday evenings is family night, but in reality they make you feel that everyday is family day.  Wonderful place to enjoy a quick meal."}
{"text":"Being that I don't eat bread (allergy), going to Chick-fil-A is pretty rare. However, my daughter wanted Chick-fil-A on Saturday at lunch time, so I went to this location. Of course, the line was beyond long... typical for Chick-fil-A at lunch time - any day of the week. But we were in and out of the drive-thru line in less than 6 or 7 minutes. They had employees taking orders and allowing you to pay, so the line ran smoothly and quickly, which was a plus! Big plus. I have noticed they do this at multiple Chick-fil-A's these days, but anyway... the food was fresh, hot and correct! Whatever they do to make their business run effectively (including the customer service and the smiles, positive vibes from employees), they need to share with other restaurants. I love going to Chick-fil-A for those reasons especially!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and every time that staff has been professional and friendly. The food has always been great and the restaurant/bathrooms clean."}
{"text":"For a fast food restaurant - this place is amazing. Their food always tastes fresh and their waffle fries dipped in their cheese sauce are amazing. 

This place also has incredible staff. Twice while sitting at my table, someone came around to ask if I needed a drink refill or to see if I needed anything else. The staff is really friendly and actually seem to care about the appearance of their restaurant. The restaurant is also squeaky clean and well laid out. 

My only complaint is that the drink fountain is behind the counter so you need to ask for a refill on your drink but that's not a huge issue as there is always staff out in the dining room offering to fill your drink for you.

Definitely recommend this place over a lot of other fast food restaurants - even despite their backwards politics."}
{"text":"We visited this Chick-Fil-A tonight and it took 27 minutes to get through the drive thru.  I was going to make this a two star review because the food was hot when we got it, but then my wife noticed that the coupon they gave us as an apology had already expired.

Not cool."}
{"text":"I had only been going to Chick Fil A over the past few years for a chicken sandwich, lunch or dinner. I'm hooked on the chicken minis on the breakfast menu. Just the right balance between the bread and the chicken. Drenching it in honey makes it more awesome.

This place is what customer service is all about. I always try to thank every employee when they provide prompt, courteous service. Love the \"Cathy-ism\" when they respond \"my pleasure.\""}
{"text":"Greasy, buttery and disgusting.  Six winged chicken just does not taste good.  Look at the nutritional info."}
{"text":"Held a birthday party here. Great food & service. Erin was very helpful from start to finish. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The service and food are great! We walked in and we're welcomed 3 times before we made it to the counter. I kept changing my mind and my order and Katrina went with it and was very friendly! Great customer service! We had a lot in our hands when we were looking for a place to sit and Alex was very friendly and helped us get get to a seat and brought our food. He was always walking around with a smile on. I never left my chair and had the table clean and my drink refilled while my daughter played at the play area. May even came by and had a very pleasant conversation with us  they made our lunch that more enjoyable. I would love to bring my business back here! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious as always. But the employees are so rude! I came her last week for lunch and I received a lot of attitude from the girl that took my order. She seemed annoyed that I was making her take my order. Same attitude I received today with a different girl! Haven't even seen anyone smile! The girl who brought the food to me didn't say anything. Just dropped my tray and left after I thanked her! Seriously? At least pretend like you are happy to be employeed!"}
{"text":"Short & sweet...the service here can't possibly get any better (yes it's that good).  They are so friendly that I want to leave them a tip even when I'm going through the drive through.  They have better customer service than a lot of restaurants.

I eat here more for breakfast mainly because I LOVE the chicken minis which I think they should serve all day because they are so tasty.

And the new ketchup packets rock :)"}
{"text":"I just tried calling the store to report my challenges with the curbside ordering service but nobody answered and there was no machine to leave a message so I'm hoping management sees my message here. 

I appreciate the convenience of the curbside pickup but it's very frustrating when you're trying to eat in the car on the go and 1) you don't have a fork to eat your grilled chicken or your salad, 2) the sauce for your kid's nuggets wasn't included, 3) the straw paper is so tight, you can't get the straw out without bending it flat, and 4) the toy you specifically requested for your toddler (20 mos) is for ages 4+. 

Fortunately the food is good so I'm sure we will come back but I'm very frustrated at the lack of attention to the details that matter and influence the customer experience."}
{"text":"I love this place but I don't understand how can a fast food chain as important as this have difficulties that keeps them from opening at the time they should. I was waiting for the drive thru to open when someone approached me to tell me they wouldn't open until 7am and that was maybe cause they were having technical difficulties. Also not even a sign or anything, I had to wait for a kid to approach me from the inside and tell me so. Terrible image on such an important fast food chain.  #embarassing #shame"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and the best breakfast burrito around.  This place gets pretty busy in the AM, but moves people through quickly."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chick-fil-A I've ever visited.  We experienced a long wait time for food that arrived cold.  Both my biscuit and chicken were hard and over cooked.  I will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Went in tonight with a coworker during our meal break. We were luckily to hit during a \"less busy\" time even though it still was a complete zoo. I've been to chick-fil-a a few times in California but it was a first for this location. Parking was horrible but I assume once the excitement of a new restaurant wears off a little it will be better. Service was fantastic as always and the food was perfect. So glad to finally have them in Vegas. Build one on the northwest side of town please!"}
{"text":"Today was such a blast,  we came for the beach event for our little neice and stayed through dinner.  
My salad was terrific as always. 

But Sheila sure wonderful to us tonight. She is the marketing director,  and she stopped by to talk a while.  She is delightful!! And she helped hubs with our calendar card questions.  She helped me find all 9 story cubes.  (That's a great game in case you want to play with the kids over the summer) 

My neice had a blast playing in the water for the beach event.  And we all had a delightful supper together.  

I highly recommend this restaurant.  Alyssa was wonderful as well.  She was so pleasant.  

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here the family atmosphere. They have always taken expired coupons in the past, so I was very surprised when my expired coupon was not accepted on this visit. Apparently their policy has changed."}
{"text":"Love chik fil a, and the food is fine here but please check orders.  3 times in a row they forgot to pack the children's milk and they also gave me kids fries instead of fruit."}
{"text":"Ahh, Chick-fil-a!  Back when I lived in San Francisco, I could not believe they were so far away from the city.  Such elusive yet delectible fried chicken should not be kept far from the masses!
This chick-fil-a is in the mall, but still good.  Don't forget: this is Cleveland, so you pay less if you tell them the order is to go, rather than to eat in the mall.  I still don't understand that little piece of logic.
A full service Chick-fil-a with breakfast, although you cannot get it until 9am."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food and service. Sometimes I get startled at the friendliness since we're not in Canada, but eh, I'm a fan all around."}
{"text":"This line is always INCREDIBLY long. Even then, they'll opt to have their staff outside, taking orders and causing an even larger line. I get wanting to give a more personal touch to customer service, but let's be smart about it."}
{"text":"What no one needs is a name for a drive-thru order. Especially when they're just going to pronounce it incorrectly. Just makes me already not like you. Also would help if they didn't talk over you the entire time. Didn't have my 1-item fry order ready when it was slow, didn't ask if I wanted dipping sauces. When I did get them, it was a box filled with tiny end bits. Just...no."}
{"text":"Oh how I love chick family a!  It's almost like walking into in and out.  You know your body is going to be so happy soon you can't wait. 

I get 3 piece chicken strips along with a chicken sandwich.  Of course, I have to get the real lemonade as the drink because there is no other better tasting lemonade anywhere.  The sated is always on point and super polite with every customer I have ever seen come in.  

I have yet to find a chick fil a below 5 stars and I'm not going to disappoint anyone tonight.  Way to be on your game today staff and the food is, as always, delicious.

Please open a store in old town Scottsdale.  I would be glad to take the role of GM for this restaurant and make it #1 in America hands down.  To management, I dare you to take me up on that!  Lol no joke. Cali has nothin on AZ!  Boom"}
{"text":"I would give a 5 star but they dont have a grilled chicken deluxe not just crispy chicken. I love grilled chicken more with pepper jack and all the fixings. Doesnt that sound amazing?"}
{"text":"This place provides exceptional courteous service. The line could be out the door and the employees still treat you like you matter. I really like their traditional breaded chicken but their chicken noodle soup and chicken salad sandwich is also tasty. The peppermint milk shake is a great holiday treat!"}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A is a GREAT location! Their service is always speady, food is always fresh, and the customer service is great! love coming here!! 

also..the spicy chicken sandwhich is delicous! :)"}
{"text":"Great location, staff is super friendly. They are always very polite and greet you with a warm smile!!! My one small observation is that the staff seem to replicate robots: My pleasure!! My pleasure, but do they mean it!!! NO I doesn't seem that way. As they continue to greet and smile and constantly say My pleasure there is almost for certain a smirk and (I'm not looking at you I'm only doing my job) look or a short roll of the eyes. The food is good , clean and my kids enjoy the play area. Therefore I must give this establishment/location 3 stars."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A locations always has great customer service, tasty food and product. 

My issue & upset today with this location was that this store owner has his employees standing outside in 108 degree weather at 1pm taking orders. WHY?! Why is it that people have more concern and empathy for a dog left in heat/sun?! These are human beings. I said I felt at window with owner standing next to window. Guess he was TOO busy being busy. The girl at window,  \" it helps us speed up orders\". If the owner really wants to speed up service or give quality service then why doesn't he stand out in the heat with a smile and meet his customers?! NEVER giving this place my money again."}
{"text":"Good location. Can eat, have my little one play till she gets tired and even at times be entertained with special events they have.

Customer service could be better with checking on drink refills.

HUGE HUGE HUUUUUGE bummer: no free wi-fi. 
(I'd rather drive all the way to the location near Fashion Square mall just for that reason alone).

Otherwise....it's clean, good food and one of the few 'healthier eats'"}
{"text":"This location is great. Always very clean, accommodating servers and cooks. My daughter is allergic to wheat and they are careful when they prep her food. Also, I love the healthy options available too. Place-mats, cherrio cups, balloons and playground for the kiddos, what else could be better. I support and suggest this Chick-fil-A location."}
{"text":"Honestly the best experience i have ever received from start to finish!! I got greeted walking up entering in when i placed my order it was ready super quick. My experience was literally rad i had to speak with the manager to let him know how awesome everyone and everything was! If you are looking at these reviews all you need to know this chick fil a rocks!!! They just earned a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I have been very slow to post a review. This Chik-Fil-A was my son's first job. I would advise any parent against sending their children to work here. My son was 18 at the time, so there was nothing I could do to address how he was being treated, given that he is an adult. However, after being there for a couple of months he took the courage and quit. I'm very glad he did, after I heard how one of the manager's spoke to him over the phone...very rude. I had a talk with him about not tolerating disrespect, and he admitted that this was the behavior of the leadership in this store. 

I have managed in 5 different restaurants for a restaurant group and when bringing in new staff we would take time, at least 4 hours per shift, to get them oriented and properly trained for about 2 weeks. This was not the case at this Chik-Fil-A. Myson would be scheduled for 4 hour shifts, but within the first week he worked 30 minute shifts and was sent home, cutting his shifts short...this was a constant pattern for 2 mths.
Shortly after leaving that job he started working for another restaurant. He was given the opportunity to become oriented to his responsibilities and has been working for the company for almost a year. 

The reason I waited to post is so that I could get an understanding of my son's work ethic...superb, according to his managers. I'm so thankful he didn't give up or doubted his ability to be a great contributor to society."}
{"text":"Wow. A fast food restaurant operating with high customer service! This is amazing. You never see this level of friendliness with fast food establishments or see employees who genuinely seem happy to be in their jobs. These people ARE!
Aubrey was a delight and instantly put my husband and I in a great mood. The manager (younger, African American male -did not get his name) runs an
AMAZING
ship and I am so thankful to see young people thrive. Keep up the great work!

Only complaint and it won't change the number of stars ( clean off the credit card machine). It was kind of dirty. Not a huge deal but it will take you from a perfect ten to an eleven!"}
{"text":"Last night my 3 yr old son and I got food poisioning. My poor son was in severe pain vomitting and had diareha and I had the worse pain ever like having a baby and blood in my stool. I never ever thought we would get food poisioning.  I called to make a compliant and had the worse customer service.  To me, its all about customer service and the guy literally hung up on me when I asked for his name and then when I called back a lady yelled at me and refused to give me her name. Without customers you do not have a job.  I have called chick fil ala headquarters and also the local health department. I pray no one ever goes through what we went through after eating there. I'm beyond shocked."}
{"text":"Loved this location! We went earlier in the morning and the food was delish! I got the chicken club and it was super juicy! The chicken was huge and poking out the sides! I was super impressed! And the service was impeccable! No complaints what so ever!!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A .... I am from the south of the US, and I always look forward to eating at Chick-fil-A... so glad we have one in the Calgary airport, I will  be there often"}
{"text":"I've never had a horrible experience at Chik-fil-A. The other day, even with teenage kids working there, their staff was very pleasant. 

My four year old likes the play area, and I love it because I can sit on the other side of glass walls and its SOUND PROOF. A dream for parents!"}
{"text":"Always a line but don't worry that's just because it's so good.  The management knows how to handle it ... so just know besides the fact that it's delicious it's efficient and that line moves fast!"}
{"text":"I love it 
granted the politics of the chain is BS
but its good food all and all , all in all ?
I like it ...love it"}
{"text":"Best chicken fast food anywhere.  I've said it it before and I'll say it again,  Chick-fil-A has the best chicken sandwich and chicken fingers in the fast food industry.  I wish there were more chick-fil-a locations which is one of their drawbacks.  But when you find one near you it's like having the best day ever!  

This is a newer location that just opened in north Scottsdale.  I give this the 4 stars for the same reason I give all Chick-fil-A locations 4 stars, lack of locations and not being open on Sunday's.  The one day I crave fast food from an overwhelming weekend and they are closed!  Argh!"}
{"text":"This location is excellent I placed  a catering order  @ the wrong location. They took care of me quickly. I was able to make it to my party on time."}
{"text":"Ugh went back there today and the fries are really cold and soggy again !!! 
Lemonade tastes kinda soapy too."}
{"text":"Went here at 8am to get food, and I wanted lunch items. When I got to the window, they told me the fries would take a minute and had me pull up to the parking space, and handed me a free sandwich coupon. Cool! I know that ordering something when it's not the right time takes longer, but that was cool. Then when I get my food, they slipped in some extra chicken slider things! Amazing service!!!"}
{"text":"This rating is for the superb drive thru experience at this location. We have passed by before and elected not to order because the line seemed too long. This time (Saturday around 1 p.m) around we decided to wait. I have never seen a drive thru move as efficient as this one. There had to be 8-10 cars in front of us in addition to all the people ordering inside (line that extended out the door) and we were in and out within 5 minutes. They had employees outside taking your orders. Another employee outside telling which car in the two lanes to move forward. Another employee taking the payment for the order, and the last employee handing out the food. Keep up the great work! This is how I would expect In-N-Out to move their drive thru line. 

As far as the food goes, it is good stuff. We've had it before in San Diego so it is nice to finally have something local. I would recommend the spicy chicken deluxe."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. They keep this place very clean considering the location. It's high volume and bordering a seedy part of town. The staff is the majority of high school girls and they seem to be the perfect fit because they are all swarming around doing their jobs and its good to see because it's a great place. There's a lot of locations where I'm from in Laguna beach and orange county so I'm comparing this to those and it makes it. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This chick fila is awful. I grew up with Chick Fil A, but moving to Michigan and then Long Island makes it a treat. I eat a Chick Fil A a good bit on business trips and this was was awful. I went twice and both times they got my order wrong at the drive through. And I honestly really feel they skimped on the chicken salad in the chicken salad sandwich. I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"I am writing my review to the leadership. Reason being is, I have no idea why the lines be jam packed then when you get your food its cold and so old till the fingers are turning dark orange. You can tell they been sitting there for quite some time. How is this possible when the store and drive through is crowded? I think sometimes the employees cook too many fingers when there is a slight downturn in customers during non busy hours. Then all of a sudden a pack of people come at one time and now the restaurant is back crowded. They then start the \"conservation\", \"preservation\" method in which they give the customers old stale fingers that been sitting there for a while during a not so crowded time of day instead of throwing them away. Please stop this method if that is what is being used to save on \"food waste\". Everyone deserves a hot meal. They are paying their hard earned money for it. Chick-fil-a food is the best when nice and hot. It is horrible when cold and old. These lines are too long for someone to hang out in just to get their food and it is old and stale. PLEASE, PLEASE throw that old food away and stop giving it to folks especially those coming through the drive through thinking they are going to drive off and not check their food. Thanks in advance!!!"}
{"text":"I don't really get what the big craze is about Chik fil A. I've tried it a few times and I've always thought the food was just sub par. 

Once I tried a wrap and didn't even want to eat all of it (big deal for me tbh) because it didn't seem very fresh. A different time I had a chicken sandwich and again it was alright but nothing special. I'll come here as a last resort but there's so much other good food in the area that I pretty much never do.

Combine the fact that I find their food to be boring with my distaste for some of the owner's political views, and it's just in general not my type of restaurant."}
{"text":"*CUSTOMER SERVICE BASED
I was excited and woke up at 7am this morning to head over there to try their breakfast for the first time. Went thru the drive thru and I ordered 2 of their breakfast burritos along with hash browns. I was mostly excited to have hash browns to enjoy with my meal since it came in a box that looked plentiful. 
I was sadly disappointed once I got home to realize that they didn't give me my hash browns along with my two burritos and I was still charged for them :( 
Bad first breakfast experience for me. Didn't think they would screw up my order first thing in the morning since they weren't even busy. Hopefully this won't happen again."}
{"text":"Alright.  I'll get them up to 3 stars because they've managed to get my breakfast order correct the past 3 times I've been there.  They are still on double secret probation though.   I wish I didn't get the craving for the crack chicken."}
{"text":"Nice place but not enough options, for people with dietary restrictions, so we had to leave..."}
{"text":"Chicken. If you love good fried chicken sandwiches this place is your spot. The staff is young but professional and management has this placed running like a well oiled machine. 

My recent discovery is their app. I recommend giving it a shot. You order right on your phone and just let them know when you get there. Super slick."}
{"text":"It's chick fil a....nothing major. It was packed during lunch time and the drive thru was moving. It did not take long to get our food. The staff in the drive thru were great."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! I called the day after I got my food, because I had to go straight to work. I ordered the chicken sandwich without lettuce and couldn't eat it as I'm allergic. The lady who answered the phone starting to grill me why I didn't call right away, being extremely rude. I didn't even want to replace the sandwich I just wanted to let them know what happened. Then she kept me on hold for ten minutes until I called back at and someone else answered. I told her I just wanted a apology, she sarcastically stoically gave me one. I would find a different place to get chicken. Raising canes is right down the road and very good."}
{"text":"Finally made it and I want it again already. Lol. Walked in and waited in line which was only about a 10 min wait. After they took my order I went to the register to pay. About 5 mins later I was enjoying my delicious nuggets, fries, and frosted strawberry lemonade.  The customer service was great, you were checked on after you received your food. For them to be new to Vegas and just now opening you can't get any better. For the ppl complaining about bad service and the food not being good maybe they need to reevaluate themselves."}
{"text":"My 12 pcs consisted of crumbs and four REAL nuggets!!  WTF!?!  I took my order back and asked for my money back...  the nuggets are the size of nickels!  They have a limited menu here!!!!  Go someplace else for your food while at the airport, and if you DO order here, make sure you check your food before walking away from the counter!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this chick-fil-a! They are friendly. Ricardo used to work here, he was my favorite so nice and always joking with everyone. 

I love their chicken noodle soup! So delicious. Also their side salad is good, they give you little red bell peppers as croutons(so good). I love getting the Chick-fil-a deluxe(it comes with lettuce & tomatoe) the original comes with just pickles on it. 

If you get a kids meal you can trade your toy for ice cream. 

Some times they have family nights were they do crafts and face paintings with the kids. Also they do have a play place inside.

{"text":"Best drive through experience ever. We went during the heart of lunchtime and it was seamless. Actually talked to human beings outside who used iPads to enter our orders. Four workers outside working the line to make everything go smoothly."}
{"text":"For fast food this is the place - wait staff are attentive - food is great - place is very very clean .. Two thumbs way up"}
{"text":"The staff here is so amazing. I eat here several times a week and sometimes twice a day. The food is always on point and correct to order. Everyone is happy and upbeat. Today I decided to try somewhere else mistake I went to Cane's gave up way to slow, tried Freddy's same thing so I gave up and went back to where I should have started in the first place! Thanks for being on point, helpful, polite and always amazing! If you come here and there is a line don't worry it will go way faster than you think."}
{"text":"My Chick-n-Minis sucked, the bread was dry and not lightly coated with honey butter. Disappointing since I love Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"I normally don't review fast food, just because they're pretty much all the same.  Everyone knows how great the food is at Chic-Fil-A but what you may not know is how great goodies are.......especially the the best milkshakes around, my favorite being the banana pudding.......now never mind the 700 calories it carries that's not important:-).....everything in moderation.  Let's not even talk about the chocolate chip cookies they now serve......this cookie rivals nestle toll house....seriously!  Served slightly warm and packing 300 plus calories...again everything in moderation.  Just thought I'd give you the 411 on some of the best goodies in uptown if you were not aware:-)"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience at this restaurant. It started by me walking into the restaurant at 10:33am and we were 3 mins too late for breakfast. I was fine with this but really wanted breakfast. So we ordered two lunch menu meals. When we got home the fries were undercooked and they forgot one of the meals. I called the store back and explained to the manager Darwin I didn't want a free gift card I wanted the meal I ordered and I didn't want to go back into my hot car to get it. He explained to me they were understaffed and too busy to bring my sandwich to me. The understaffed problem is probably why they forgot my sandwich. I also emailed the main company with no response. It seems like this company doesn't care much for their customers. Also i guess it was my fault for expecting them to actually get the order right but this was handled incorrectly after the fact."}
{"text":"Sounds like since your Gold Star in June things have gone south....

just sayin..........

Even though you are proud of your Gold Star from a couple months ago, it does not eliminate the fact that I had several large fungus clumps in my tea shortly after this so-called inspection."}
{"text":"The service is always excellent! Everyone is professional and friendly. I love the food, and it's always been fresh. I would recommend going into the store rather than the drive thru since it's so long normally! Not sure why these reviews are so negative! I've never had a bad experience. Great chicken and waffle fries. I also love the chick Fil a sauce and salads!"}
{"text":"NOT ENOUGH SAUCE. 2 sauces for a 3 count doesn't supplement for the amount, much less a 4 count. I had to sparingly tap my fries in my sauce because there WASN'T ENOUGH. I'm disappointed..."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A, but this is the worst one I've ever been to and that's including hospital, mall, and campus locations! We've recently moved to the area and have visited this location at least 10 times hoping it will be better the next time. The last time we went will be the last time. We got breakfast chicken biscuits that tasted frozen or maybe had just been sitting too long at 7am. Employees have never been friendly when we go which is disappointing because that's what the Chick-fil-A brand is known for. Now we'll have to travel just to go to a decent Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"So glad we visited this Chick-fil-A! After months of visiting one of the worst Chick-fil-A's in America (Gastonia location) we finally decided to drive a few miles to Belmont's location! Great customer service and great food, just what we expect from this chain!"}
{"text":"Embarrassingly nice staff. I came with my toddler, and they brought out my food for me, along with crayons for my daughter. When they realized she didn't eat her fruit cup, they offered another side free of charge.

Play area very nice too. Politics aside, darn good food."}
{"text":"Good chicken
Good waffle fries
Nice people but
Slow service (took 15 minutes to get food order inside on a rather slow day)

Plenty of little kids using pretty nice looking enclosed play area
Clean premises

On balance one of the better fast food options in the area"}
{"text":"I love coming to this Chick Fil-A because they're always courteous and they have great customer service. I love Chick Fil-A in general, they are my go to fast food chain. I like they have added additional sides beside yogurt and a fruit cup to their menu. Their new super foods side (kale, broccolini, craisins with a side of pecans, walnut and sliced almond mixture) is very delicious. It comes with some type of vinegarette already on it, so if you have allergies, you may want to ask what's in the vinegarette since it's pre-mixed, I'm assuming."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes and never got my milkshake. I came in specifically for the milkshake. I jumped back in line to wait patiently to see what happened and Katrina who I assumed would be helping me out next waved her friends which were waiting behind me over to her register and proceeded to take their order and ignore me. I love Chick-fil-A. I have never received such terrible unfriendly service at any Chick-fil-A in my life. No wonder this location has terrible reviews."}
{"text":"Standard Chick-Fil-A, located in the mall food court. Typically busy, but the staff does a decent job of handling the rush. Closed on Sundays. Mr. Robinson, the manager, is very enthusiastic and jokes around with the customers. He makes the experience a little less monotonous.

Grade: B+"}
{"text":"They get 3 stars because I like their chicken nuggets, waffle fries, and ice cream cones.

I do have to say that I'm not a fan of this location, however. I only go because I'm frequently at Beachwood mall. Today, I ordered grilled nuggets among other items, and they gave me regular nuggets. This is the 4th time now someone doesn't listen correctly to my order and gives me the wrong nuggets.

I didn't go back, because the last time I did, the cashier had a bad attitude and was upset with me when it was their error and not mine. I think they should hire new staff.

Lines are long during lunch and weekends."}
{"text":"Decent food, wonderful customer service. I don't often eat too much \"fast food\" but I do make the occasional exception for Chick Fil A. This location is very clean and again the customer service from the time you enter the store to the time you leave is superb. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This place needs to get their act together!! SERIOUSLY!! Literally every time I come here my order is messed up. I end up having to take time out of my day to sit there and wait for them to go back inside fix the order make it correctly, how it should've been the first time!! I went inside and spoke to the \"manager\" on duty and he gave me an \"I don't care\" attitude. They don't offer you anything. It's like he's used to the customer complaints so he didn't seemed bothered by it. Do yourself a favor and don't go here if your time is valuable and you don't have time to waste. I would suggest you don't go here because they don't care about your order or your time clearly because they continue to mess it up repeatedly.  Over and over again something needs to change. There is a PDQ right down the street and I will go there instead."}
{"text":"Second time in a row for us that there was an issue. Our first experience here in Scottsdale, ordered my kids chicken nugget meals and when we got home there was NO CHICKEN in either!!! Hungry kids w no lunch is not something I care to deal with. This most recent visit, they didn't catch that I ordered two kids meals so it was corrected at the window but then only one kids meal had a straw and neither had 'toys'. Also one set of nuggets had a ridiculous amount of breading and the other set had virtually none. Lack of consistency is surprising for a chain. We do not eat fast food regularly and my children look at it as a treat but when they don't get the kids meals they expect, it's disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was great! Place was clean! Was very busy but the customer service could be better. We waited longer than we should have for our food and the couple who sat behind us, their order wasn't filled could correctly twice. When he went to speak to the manager it appeared the manager wouldn't accommodate or comp that couple's meal. To me, that is very poor customer service. While the food was great the customer service could have been way better."}
{"text":"I love Chikfila always. It could be nostalgic from my childhood but I think I will always be a fan of their nuggets and waffle fries. If you just want a snack a kids meal is just enough to satisfy. 

They must have a phenomenal training onboarding program when hiring because every single employee I've ever interacted with has been nothing but pleasant and very excellent customer service. It does not go unnoticed!! 

This specific one is located in a semi busy area with Costco, Sams Club and Walmart all within half mile radius. It's right off the access road of the 101."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fast food chicken shop Las Vegas has to offer.  Great food, easy to read menu and superb service."}
{"text":"First visit at the ASU Chick-Filet. Brand new, up to date, I'll be a regular. PUMPED !!"}
{"text":"Drive through was so fast! I couldn't keep up and it was during my lunch break which I expected it to take long but the entire process was like five minutes. The ladies that took the order outside were super friendly and efficient. Food was delicious as always. The layout of the parking lot and drive through area was also very smartly designed."}
{"text":"If you can believe it, I have never before been to a Chick-filet-A . Till this one visit.
I have to say,I really liked it a lot.
Fresh real pieces of Chicken. lettuce and tomato. The only thing I would change is the bun. It is a bit of a junky bun. Maybe if they toasted it ,it would be a little better.
If they changed the bun altogether it would be perfect!

Fries were really good! Waffle fries, hot ,fresh, and lots of potato on them.
For a drink I got lemonade,which was made with real lemons and just a small amount of sugar, so it was not over whelminly sweet.

Really good, so happy I finally got to try it!
Now I understand the cow ads as well!!"}
{"text":"So did a mobile order for the first time. It was super easy! Also ordered breakfast for the first time at Chick-fil-A. I got the chicken biscuit & 4 count minis & hash browns. It was delicious. The chicken biscuit was super good, you can taste the honey in the biscuit. It's good with any sausage for example mayo, ranch or polynesian. Polynesian sauce is my favorite for the chicken biscuit & minis. 

They do have a couple of outdoor seating. There's a play place inside.

{"text":"I go to Chic-Fil-A and order their Chic-Fil-A sandwich at least twice a week. Best chicken sandwich on the planet. The Chic-Fil-A comes with some pickle chips. I always ask for extra and get it with no charge. 

Chick-fil-A is widely known for their friendly staff because it's part of their training but this one always seems above and beyond. 

The employees inside and at the drive thru are incredibly friendly and cheerful.

If there is a long line in the drive thru - they have staff outside taking orders and payment to expedite the service.

This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Great clean and delicious chicken sandwiches! If you've been to Chick fil A you know that their food is prepared fresh and is quickly served. I find the employees are very professional and always friendly. I also like their chicken nuggets with honey mustard sauce."}
{"text":"Yes there's a line on most days but have no fear they've got employees outside handling orders ! Remarkable service and good food is why there's a line ! 
Orders are easy and price is right ! Location had its challenges but the manager is on it ! Employees are efficient and friendly! 
Just ask for something extra .... it's their pleasure to serve you !
Two thumbs way up ChickFilA !"}
{"text":"The consistent quality of Chick-Fil-A has made me a lifelong fan of the business and I cannot say enough about how they employees treat the customers. I truly believe they treat me better than some of my relatives, which is astonishing based on the amount of growth the company has undergone in recent years.  The food is always fresh, hot, and made to order, which is something that is becoming a thing of the past within the \"fast food\" market. I can only hope the standard Chick-Fil-A has set is taken into account by other food providers, as I find that even local upper scale eateries cannot keep pace with the service Chick-Fil-A provides."}
{"text":"The way fast food should be - friendly staff fantastic food - yes please. Best chick Fil A around!"}
{"text":"This Chick-Fil-A rocks my socks off!! That sounds like a bit of an overstatement, doesn't it? Well, it's not. We have been here several times for lunch and the line is LONG. The first time I approached I was so disappointed at the length of the line and almost opted to leave however we were in and out in 10 minutes! The had two people taking orders with iPads, took payment while you waited in line (cash register set up by the area where you would normally order), and all you had to do was pull up and grab your food. I've never had anything come wrong, they give plenty of sauces, and are always super friendly. In fact, if I'm having a bad day I might just come here just because I'm pretty sure the staff here would cheer me up with their great attitudes. That, my friends, is rare these days but this Chick-Fil-A delivers every time!"}
{"text":"I was amazed right at the moment I walked in. The store was decorated beautifully with Easter theme and egg hunting invitations. Numerous ingredients were offered at the end counter after customers finished their orders. There was a huge kid area with interesting slides and colors. Service was superb and very attentive, the crowd were great, and the food was decent. Menu was easy to follow, chicken was tender but crispy as usual. We will be back."}
{"text":"All these peeps complaining but I had a great time. Ordered with the mobile app and skipped a line that was out the door. Booya!"}
{"text":"This location is quick and just like other locations, very friendly. Did you know they have spicy chicken?!  Discovered this recently and...wow!!!  Sooooo good!!  I'm craving it all the time now!"}
{"text":"There were no cows here reminding us to eat more chikin, but there was some great tasting food as usual. It's never a bad idea to eat at Chickfila. If the food doesn't capture your heart, the well mannerisms of the employees will. Even though I know somedays some of these employees may not be in the mood to be nice sometimes, most of the time they are very nice. This location was no different. The cashier was kind and always replied with the famous \"my pleasure\" after I thanked her. The food was great and the restaurant was clean. One deduction in my rating is because of what happened in our car. We got some Icedream cones to go, and one of them broke in half at the base of the cone after we had already left. The top half of the cone and ice cream fell onto our clothes and car. Other than that, great experience as usual."}
{"text":"So good! Hot and fresh. Made just how I asked. Will continue to visit this location. 
The manager when I ordered inside seemed to be frustrated with me because I was looking st the menu for a min because it was only my second time being there."}
{"text":"Overall food is really good.  I still don't understand how crazy this place has been.  You would think they are giving every customer free food for a year.  But again, solid chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Love the place always.. Deluxe spicy chicken sandwich is my all time favourite.. The staff is also very nice well behaved"}
{"text":"I wish this was a better experience. It was alright, but nothing too amazing. 

So, the first thing I would note is that getting into the drive-thru itself is a feat. There are usually a TON of vehicles in line here, so unless you come at off-peak hours, you will have to wait. The good news is that the staff does apparently deal with lines pretty well. 

The food that I ordered was fine. The chicken and waffle fries were good, albeit a bit salty. The lemonade I got was also pretty good, not great though. I preferred the location in Tempe if I'm totally honest. I'm not sure I would come back, although I may change my mind in the future.

I wasn't too impressed with the service though. The girl in the drive thru barely spoke to me and was preoccupied with talking to her fellow employee about something else while I waited at the window. She could've smiled and looked at me when giving me my order, that would've been nice."}
{"text":"This have alway been I go too when I'm craving. Inside and the drive thru is every efficient and customer service are great.. I guess you kinda expect their customer service to be on point.. But nothing to complain here."}
{"text":"I stop here at least 3x every trip to Las Vegas. It's not too far off the strip so it's easy to get to and from. Service is excellent. I like the layout of the place. Restrooms always clean. Can't ask for any more. Frequently busy but they bring food out fast."}
{"text":"The service and food is excellent, I really see how Chick-fil-A is so popular. They make every effort to help make any errors right with the customer. Who doesn't enjoy good food and good service. It will always be a favorite of mine due to the good tasting chicken and service."}
{"text":"Came here for receipt day. You buy whatever you like and keep your receipt and come back the next month and give them the receipt that you kept and you get the same food free. So basically eat twice for the price of one. Really good deal. The next receipt day is April 14. 

Their chicken is super good. I love the Chick-fil-A deluxe. And their soup is super good. They have chicken tortilla or chicken noodle soup. My brother loves the spicy deluxe. Their sauces are good. 

They have a play place inside. Also there's seats outside.

{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at Chick fil a until today. I placed an order on the mobile app and went inside to the counter to pick up my order. The employees there are SO rude. First of all I waited 20 mins before anyone even acknowledged me at the counter. Then after walking up to one of the registers someone finally asked if I had been helped. I told him that I had a mobile order. He went and looked and said that he didn't see it. (Mind you, I heard the girl behind the counter 5 mins prior say a mobile order for Kristyle, I noticed because she pronounced my name wrong). So after they claimed they didn't have my order I brought the order and confirmation number up in my app. My order was brought to me after another 5 mins. My order was wrong and looked disgusting the biscuit was falling apart and had an egg on it, which I didn't order. Another employee came around and asked me if everything was okay and I said no and showed her my receipt and the correct order that I made. She went and got me a chicken biscuit that looked even more disgusting and the chicken was cut on the side, wasn't even a whole patty. At this point I'm pissed and just refused to have anything else brought out. I think I'm completely done with chick fil a after this experience. Just thinking about the food and this experience makes me sick. The whole time workers are smirking behind the counter and not being helpful at all. Just rude and unprofessional, not the type of employees that chick fil a is known for."}
{"text":"Is it possible to have a bad experience at Chick-Fil-A?  It's like the Disneyland of fast food chains!  Always spotless, super clean, and inviting.  The staff is always friendly, smiling, and displaying top notch old fashion customer service.  I love that they always say \"my pleasure\" like we're back in the 1950's.  Food is ordered accurately, delivered quickly, and always hot.  I like that they will come around and refill your drink, something other fast food places do not do.  Sets them apart.  It also speaks highly that their management team is also in the mix, working hard, and setting the example for their employees.  It shows good leadership.  Keep doing what you're doing Chick-Fil-A!!!"}
{"text":"Decent place to grab lunch.
Biggest gripe is you have to go to the counter and ask for a refill on your drink.
Get the spicy chicken sandwich with the honey bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"Always understaffed. Tables are wobbly. Long waits for refills. Popular place obviously but they need to hire accordingly."}
{"text":"The service is still very good, but I find their chicken nuggets to be extremely salty. No, it is not the seasoning, it is pure salt. Either someone was a little bit overzealous while seasoning this batch  or their recipe asks for too much salt. My chicken sandwich was also on a salty side. Oh well, I will have to cook one more thing myself for now. If you are not very sensitive to salty food, go ahead, very polite people work here."}
{"text":"Out of all the chick fila restaurants, this one is the worse by far. Customer service and attention to detail is   horrible. 

I took the family to dinner a couple nights ago and used their new Mobil app to order.  The claim to fame for the app is to \"pass the line\".  

So I get there and walk to the pick up area. I then stand there waiting while the cashiers take the orders of the people who are in line and tell me they will be with me momentarily.  So I wait. One they clear out the line of the customers who were in line, they greet me. I tell them I'm there to pick up. 

I wait...and I wait. 

As I stand there waiting I am watching food go out the side door to the customers who had walked in at the same time and after me. 

Once those customers begin eating. Shortly after another mobile app customer comes in and gets her order quickly. She leave the restaurant and come right back in minutes later explaining her order was wrong. The employee collects the food they had given her and says, \"oh it this customers food\".  She then takes the kids meals from the lady and hands them to me. I tell the employee I don't want that food as it had left the restaurant and then came back. She rolled her eyes and scratched her two toned skunk hair. After trying to reason with her that I didn't want to give the food to my kids, she throws the bags in the trash and gets another employee working on the order, while she begins messing around on Facebook swiping through photos and showing anther employee at that manager station. 

I finally get my order after 35 minutes of waiting and the customers who had came in behind me are walking out with full stomachs. 

Won't use the app again and it frustrates me the lack of service here because that's what chick fila is all about. It's too bad because I love those brand and their food. Sad. 

Update:

I took the wife to breakfast and out bagel sandwich was burnt.  Reached out to them on Yelp by messaging the business. But they never responded. I called, left my name.  No call back. So now I'll share with you the horrible sandwiches we had.  This is the message I left:

We have never tried your breakfast. So with your message addressing our previously experience, we thought we would give you guys another chance. I took my wife out for breakfast this morning and one of the items we ordered was the bagel sandwich. To our displeasure, the bagel was burnt. Couldn't enjoy it. I have never tried this sandwich. So if this is how it's supposed to be, I apologize and disregard my complaint. 

I love your restaurant and appreciate everything you guys do for the community. 

Thanks. Mike"}
{"text":"The staff here is always very friendly and polite.  The restaurant is always clean organized. 

This Chick-fil-A has many community ties. So I try to support then every chance Im in the area. The owner, Leo, is always greeting guests and making them feel welcome. 

Today I tried the new grilled chicken club  chicken sandwich. Just like everything there, it was delicious. 

Only bad thing I can say about this place is that they are always crowded around lunch time."}
{"text":"The service at Westgate is always that at which one would desire. people greet you when you enter and bid you farewell when you leave. I have frequented this place since it opened and would like to comment on a couple things. First, it is always clean and a delight to eat at. Second, the food is always great, whether it is quality or a recommendation. The last thing is the manager they have there. I have met almost all of them but the best is Xhulja or Julia if you ask about it. She is always friendly no matter how stressed she is. Try her recommendations and have a conversation. she is a delight.
I recommend the Original sandwich with pepper-jack cheese and BBQ sauce. Also, ask for some milkshakes that aren't on the menu."}
{"text":"We went to chick fil a tonight for a school fundraiser. We've never been to this location and rarely go ro a chick fil a. We were very impressed. Our three boys were able to find great options on the kids menu. The mac n cheese was very good. Two of our boys ordered it and ate it all. The older boys loved their chicken nuggets and all three boys were happy to find chocolate milk as an option. 

We were very impressed with Miss Mary Ellen.  She went out of her way to engage with our family. Her kindness was appreciated. Thank you Miss Mary Ellen!"}
{"text":"With the new office being smelling-distance away of Chick-fil-A, I gave into the yummy smelling goodness and got some for lunch. 

Contrary to what a lot of people think, Chick-fil-A actually DOES have real chicken; you can SEE it. I love that it actually is real chicken (as opposed to other fast food joints), and that it's juicy and flavorful. 

On this visit, I decided to be somewhat health-conscious and got the grilled chicken nuggets (with a side of waffle fries... you can't pass up the waffle fries!) Well, the reason for the 4 stars is that I was a bit disappointed with the grilled chicken nuggets. They were good and juicy, don't get me wrong, but they seemed to have some type of weird batter on them. Not quite sure what it was... Seasoning, maybe? Anyways, I ate them regardless, just a bit disappointing. 

I think next time I'm going to stick to regular chicken nuggets, or better yet, the chicken strips... and of course, the waffle fries!"}
{"text":"I was so excited for Chik-fil-A to come to Madison because I have heard so many good things about this fast food joint. I am honestly not impressed. I have gone a couple of times since they opened and the fries and chicken are always soggy, no crunch. I can't handle it. Their chick-fil-A sauce is delicious but can it be made at home. Their lemonade is good but it's served in Styrofoam cups :-(  The customer service is good but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is a nice location for \"Chick-fil-a\" because of the lack of other fast food selections in the area. You do have Jimmy Johns, Luke's of Chicago and Paradise nearby, but this is the only dedicated chicken option available and the others are more sitdown and  not necessarily fast. 

The folks behind the counter are always very nice and helpful; but the real reason to come here is the chicken which is outstanding! The variety of their sandwiches are good and tasty. In other areas where we have lived in the past, there was no Chick-fil-a, just KFC. So, we were very pleased and pleasantly surprise to find them. The food is great! 

So in summary, we really enjoy coming here for a different lunch & dinner option when we feel like anything BUT hamburgers and we want really good chicken! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Staff is super friendly, helpful, and exceptionally polite.

Food is delicious, especially the waffle fries and the desserts.  Sandwiches are good too.

Service is great, even when it's busy (which is almost all the time, from my experience)."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The app to order is also quick and easy to use. I work in the same complex and they have keep the ppl and cars flowing with no extreme back up traffic. Great job to the employees and Metro. So glad they put one on this side of town."}
{"text":"The food was good. It's was fresh and hot. Exactly what chick fila should be. 

So why the three stars?  Man were they rude. The girl who took our order in the drive thru was awful. I think we must have interrupted her doing nothing. Then the man who took our money and gave us our food did not utter one single word the entire transaction. I think he may have been a manager. 

Be nice people!  You get Sundays off!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast- chicken on a biscuit is awesome.  And their diet lemonade always leaves me happy.

If you plan on coming for lunch and want to zip thru the drive-thru.... expect a wait or go inside!  This place is popular around noon!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food, but it's everything else that makes this place exceptional. Great service, cleanliness, and genuinely friendly staff! There's a reason why it's always busy."}
{"text":"Never coming back here ever. 25 min wait in drive thru then they tell me to park out front and wait more?! Seriously... It's a Saturday, did you expect it to be slow?

Edit: total wait time 30 mins. Good job... NOT"}
{"text":"When you want fast food, this is the place to go. Chick fil a sauce is amazing!!! You can never go wrong with the original chicken sandwich and waffle fries. Best service i have ever recieved from not only a resturant but any business. John works at the pick up window and is always so nice, polite and respectful. If you go for breakfast the chicken bagel sandwich is amazing with chick fil a sauce. Also, their ice cream is prices very well. We take our family of 5 for ice cream to get kids cups and its less than 12 dollars. Great food and great service"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Everyone was very friendly. The restaurant and restrooms were nice and clean"}
{"text":"Great customer service! BUT THE WORST LOCATION I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! The ranch is expired, chicken horrible and frys could have been better! I can't even get a hold of them to let them know the ranch is expired!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I love this place. Everyone is so polite and well trained. The food is excellent (and they've made a recent commitment to healthier/no GMO. Yay!!). I LOVE being able to get chicken for breakfast (their biscuits are dangerously tasty), we love their chicken and I have recently have a new love affair with their market salad. Keep being awesome and THANK YOU for moving toward no GMO, it's much appreciated by your hard core Chick Fil A loving customers."}
{"text":"I've now come to this location twice & both times my order was wrong. Both times I ordered waffle fries because i specifically wanted the cheese sauce & both times it wasn't there. Then the first order I also asked for buffalo sauce Instead I got Chick-fil-A sauce. I'm picky so I didn't eat my nuggets. This time around they forgot the ranch. When I called and told them they forgot the cheese sauce and ranch they said they would have to credit me but to get the credit I would have to come inside not go through the drive thru, again inconveniencing me because i only go through the drive thu. Somehow this place can't get their shit together."}
{"text":"Did not get my order right after clarifying my order THREE times. This is by far the most disorganized and disappointing chick fil a I've ever been to. I would not recommend unless you want a surprise order that is nothing like what you intentionally ordered. I guess it's my mistake that I did not check the bag after I received it but I thought I was ordering from an organized establishment not one run by children."}
{"text":"Hate coming to this location. Can't ever park, always way too crowded, drive thru is never fast, I've been overcharged and had them fix it the last 3 visits, and they're always running out of trays when you eat in, so you have to get a to go bag which is so inconvenient!!! The reality of it is, there's a huge stack of trays and no one cleaning them! Just poorly managed. The chicken is always cooked inconsistently as well. Sometimes it's cooked well and thoroughly and other times it is barely cooked and slimy. Just not impressed overall."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and they have a good clean condiment area's Stir sticks are paper wrapped - A mint to go as well"}
{"text":"Food is always good. This particular Chick-fil-a has diapers in the bathroom for the smallest customers convenience.  They have fun activities and parties in the restaurant regularly."}
{"text":"Service is always fast and friendly. They put on great activities for the family. The last one we went to was the circus and they has a clown and balloon animals and face painting and carnival games. It's one of my favorite things about this place, that they do so much cool stuff for the family. Plus the food is better than McDonald's and just as quick."}
{"text":"Finally a location here in Las Vegas. I'm from the south so there were many there. I love their chicken sandwich , it is so tasty especially since they have the buttered buns. Slightly pricey for a sandwich but oh well what the heck. So delicious."}
{"text":"This is a busy spot, but the team moves quickly. Service was great.

The reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is that this spot has no play place. That was the whole reason we stopped here, we were at our half way point in our road trip and we stopped her specifically for lunch and to let the kids stretch their legs and get energy out."}
{"text":"Always epic. 
Smart courteous, polite.
NEVER have had an order wrong here. 
Get awesome coupons in the mail for free food.
They have a play place that is clean and well managed.
The staff is excellent, and really makes a good name for their customer service."}
{"text":"So there was a long line, but it moved super fast, at the way to the side of the shop in front of it. It looked scary but got to ordering in 10 minutes.

The food tasted as good as always.

However service was horrible. I've never been to a chik fil a where employees were rude and unfriendly. Even trying to make conversations and they had stone cold serious faces. Not only my cashier but the others I notice were the same.

Definitely on the cheaper side at $8 for a meal. Not bad for airport food prices"}
{"text":"Disgusting. My chicken was dry and my fries were so bland. They messed up my order and this was my first time here. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Been there 5 times and 5 times they have gotten my orders wrong. Today I ordered an ice dream LARGE in a cup, it came in a cone. I told them that I ordered a large in a cup and she flipped over the cone into a small cup and said here you go. Also had my order repeated to me with 4 bbqs and only gave me 1."}
{"text":"Great service at lunch time you get in and out even through the drive thru.  Food os always excellent."}
{"text":"We got chicken tortilla soup from this location and I must say it was the worst soup I have ever tasted a couple days before I had got the same soup from the Gilbert and 202 location which tasted AMAZING  and this one I have to say tasted horrible it's more like a refried bean dip!!! Texture is super thick way to thick to be called a soup and where in the world is the chicken the one I got the other day was loaded with chicken pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"Manager completely flustered and taking it out on staff. Very unprofessional. 

Staff allowed us to order breakfast as we got in line at 10:20 but didn't make it to the register till 10:35. When we ordered manager quickly informed us that breakfast is over. Lucky for us staff corrected manager. Likely never going back for breakfast at any Chick-fil-A, positively never coming back to this location for anything."}
{"text":"The best costumer service eveeeeer. Clean. Fast and the kids love it. The employees always serve with smile and curtesy. The only fast food place that I go. I love their salad"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick breakfast, I ended up here at Chick-fil-a with my son. The drive-thru line was surprisingly short which I was happy about because I was running behind. 

I specifically wanted their spicy chicken breakfast burritos, (which I know isnt on their actual menu but they would make them at the locations in TX, WA, and CA so i figured I eould ask). However, I was dissapointed when the girl said they don't have them at this location. I don't really care for their other breakfast items, but I went ahead and ordered a couple of things for my son. 

Food came out quickly, the drive-thru girl was kind, my order was right, and it tasted great according to my son. Overall, a happy experience."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Chick-fl-a.  They're good (better than McDonalds), cheap, and friendly.  Be sure to tell them 'thank you' at the end of an order.  I'm willing to bet they'll answer with a friendly, \"My pleasure\".  (Try to see what happens at the McDonalds up the street if you try this!)

If you dine inside at this location, they have an enclosed play area for the kids.  

If you come for lunch at this location come before 11:00am or after 1:00pm -- ESPECIALLY if you plan on using the drive through.  They have quite a congestion problem in the drive-through at lunch."}
{"text":"Usually good service but not today! I forgot to exchange out my daughters fries for fruit and when I went to ask they said no. I've never had issues with the customer service until today! Pretty disappointed by them. Maybe the person who took my order should have asked fruit or fries but his service was lacking as well."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit as it's right across the street from work, they're quick and friendly and I can't say I've ever had a complaint about the food ... I really like the #3, Spicy Chicken Sandwich ... just enough of a bite to know it's there without burning your tongue...
The percentage of the time by the time they finish filling my soda and giving me back my change, they're calling my name so if there's a long line ... don't worry it goes very quickly..."}
{"text":"Multiple visits.
Great food and very friendly staff.
...and whooda thunk chicken would be good for breakfast?
The chicken minis are awesome!"}
{"text":"Five stars
I grew up on CFA
It is Hot Good and well Extra Good. Order what you like its all GOOD.
All white mean chicken the king of sandwiches when it comes to chicken. The fries are the best ever to touch your lips and gums. They have pure honey & they know I'm on my way so they never run out."}
{"text":"I get the same sandwich from multiple different locations it's a 'spicy chicken sandwich with American cheese' and this is the first time I've ever been absolutely let down. I worked a double and I was starving so it made it 10x worse. I got a COLD bun, barely toasted with one pickle slice and COLD cheese.... It was obvious they didn't care how good my sandwich was, they just wanted to keep the drive thru line moving. Super bummed."}
{"text":"Only reason they get two stars is because the food tasted perfect. 

Drive they girl was a total snob when I asked to have my tea double cupped cause the past two times my straw has gone through the side spilling my drink everywhere. Not there fault, I'm just Clumsy but it put me in a terrible mood when she replied with total attitude. So yea, I didn't smile or greet her when I was at the window and I'm sure she has some mean things to say when I left. 


Fact: your tone of voice directly impacts the type of experience you have so work on it."}
{"text":"Jordan with the hazel eyes had the best services in the world. That man deserves to own the Chick-til-a franchise."}
{"text":"Very good for a fast food restaurant.  Not the greatest service, but food is consistent.  Social policies are a bit backwards, but the chicken is good."}
{"text":"What can I say it's Chick fillet but the people are kind smiling courteous when you go there and they have pretty good lemonade the only thing that sucks about this location is it's a pain in the butt to get into the parking lot and out of the parking lot but if you got a craving for Chick-fil-A that's the closest one around here"}
{"text":"If you are going to eat fast food this is a much tastier option than some other chains out there. An added bonus is that their lemonade is delicious! The restaurant is usually clean and the service is quick and friendly. I like their original chicken sandwich and the fact that their fries aren't overloaded with salt. The chicken is well seasoned and juicy and the pickles add a little zing. They are always happy to offer up sauces with your order in case you want to jazz up your sandwich or fries."}
{"text":"We love this location! Diet Lemonade is my fav! They are so sweet and friendly here! The spicy chicken sandwich is my favorite also!"}
{"text":"Love going here!! They are so nice and accommodating. I love how the manager interacts with the customers. I haven't had one bad experience yet! I would come here even more if they offered more coupons."}
{"text":"Always very busy, no matter what time of day but the staff is absolutely wonderful! And the food is amazing! Wish the drive through was constructed differently as it backs up a lot of cars but i just park, walk in and grab my food!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-a but NOT this location. The staff is rude, impolite, and agressive. Drive-thru is the worst. Dare to ask for a large bag or more ketchup and they will make a big fuss with other staff members as if you just asked them for their first born. I can hear you from my car! When I see this I feel so disappointed. How lazy can someone be?

I need a large bag. It's easier to carry our meals instead of carrying a bunch of little bags. I can just grab one large bag and head inside. Im not going to ask my kids to carry their own food bags inside. We do not have a garage so it's quite a walk to our front door from the car park apartments. Kids will drop and/or spill their food before we get inside our home. This is why I need a large bag. No need to roll your eyes, make rude comments, or complain to your co-workers around you. 

Please please please be kinder to families and moms with little ones of ALL races, shapes, and colors. Dining in is also an uncomfortable experience. My hair is not blonde nor do I have blue or green eyes but I should still be treated with respect and kindness. Nobody even offers me a refill when I dine in. 

I truly hope someone reads this and makes the necessary adjustments."}
{"text":"Went through the line for almost 20 minutes at once like but to the window telling me that they're out of chicken fillets...."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying i LOVE Chick Fil A because they have AMAZING employees and OUTSTANDING customer service! I camped out ing 15 deg wether 2ce to be forst 100. This experience made me very upset and letdown by the company. We came to AZ from Idaho to spend time with family. We took them to our favorite place and they were having a mother son night. We have 2 special need boys and one 7yr old who were hander foam swords as we walked in. On our way out we didnt think they had to return the foam swords and one employee yanked it out of the boys hands. Didnt say hey u cant take those, nothing. Multiple parents saw what happened and were very upset. The boys were crying in the parking lot so me an one other mom went back in I spoke to the manager Nick and another mom to the lady who took the swords. They ended up giving us them but I was so beside myself the place I choose to take my family to had that kind of experience."}
{"text":"My first taste of chick fil a in YEARS. It was going great until they forgot the mayo."}
{"text":"I tried to dodge this place at much as I can. But was craving yesterday so I gave in. 

Access to the place: 3/5 omg traffic is sooo bad already on South Blvd and this place stays busy. Looking to turn left into the restaurant is a pain as is. Now imagine trying to turn left onto South Blvd. Well good luck on that. Hope you have patience that day.. 

Food: 5/5 they serve their food hot and freshly made. Which I appreciate! 

Staffs: 4/5 most places I went too. They're customer service is top notch for a fast food joint. But yesterday they had their bad day apparently. Some staffs went beyond. I opted for a dine in so the food was brought to me. 

Cleanliness: 4/5 they tried their best to keep the place clean. But during lunch hour. That's when it get chaotic so it's hard to keep up 

Overall: I know there's a lot of locations I can pick from but when my craving kicks in and it's close to where I work. I would try to dodge peak times! And just starve til then"}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered a four piece \"grilled \" chicken nuggets.  I was given \"fried\" nuggets. We didn't find out until we had gotten back to our motel. 

Today I ordered an eight piece \"grilled \" chicken nuggets to eat when I arrived home. Once again I was given \"fried\" nuggets. I had to wait ten minutes to get the correct item. Fortunately I made them check the order.  I live close to a hundred miles away. I would have been furious to get home and find out my order was once again wrong. 

Sad that my order was wrong two days in a row."}
{"text":"This is the best Chickfila this side of the greater Phoenix area. Super friendly staff, good atmosphere, and as always, great food. Today, they randomly gave me a free cookie. Can't complain about that! 100% recommend."}
{"text":"I've been going to this chick fil a for years and recently had bad experiences with their customer service and it makes me want to quit going there. I tried to use the new one app there today and they weren't helpful and the manager was very rude. I left and went to another chick fil a and the service was great."}
{"text":"I really love Chick fil a I always get a chicken sandwich I love that I can just order it as is and nothing is nasty on the sandwich I always ask for bbq sauce and it is really good in my book for fast food place. The boss of this restaurant loves dogs and has beggin strips and various treats if you bring your dog though the drive thru. The ppl at the restaurant are all great and very friendly I enjoy coming here, they should come to the foothills too and take the old building the jack and the box is in. =) I'd be really happy!!!!"}
{"text":"''I could not leave less than 5 stars here*****!''  'We that is us being 4 families but all related! Stopped here for lunch on our way to Utah to stay at a family owned lodge for the weekend sometime as I recall in springtime 2016?  'This happened on my yearly trek down to Las Vegas visit my son and Granddaughter!' This Restaurant is only a short trek out of Las Vegas and sitting out in a desert setting! We placed a big order us being a party of 19 people with all the kids and adults? 'Chick fil A  is I admit an upscale fast food joint?'  However  the service was very good and the food was delicious? I liked my chicken sandwich, fries and a shake!  ''Thank you''"}
{"text":"This location is fast super clean & the food served super hot.
I love good hot food and this chicken is one of my all time favorites. Good comfort food. Very fast. Hands down will return a billion times."}
{"text":"I tried this fast food chicken place for the 1st time today. Let's start with the price of a pressed chicken sandwich with nothing else. $4.01. Now, the taste, was prepared before ordering and only warm when served. I realize a lot of people like this place, but if I want a chicken sandwich that is made when I order it and doesn't taste like it was cut from a roll of processed chicken then I will try Wendy's or Jack in the Box next time. To each their own. Thank you. Will I return, yes on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwiches and even greater customer service.  It's fast food but the service really was the cherry on top for me today.  Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"For a place that's hot, New and extremely busy!!! They sure know how to deliver fast and friendly service! Eluzia (sorry if I spelt it incorrectly) came around and offered to refill our beverages and throw away any trash for us! What?!?!?!? Super nice! People rave about this place and I went with the hype and tried it. In love! Thank you for provided outstanding costumer service!"}
{"text":"They used to have an excellent service here. But today was the worst service I ever got from this location. I dinned in, no tray to put my food on. So they handed me bunch of catchup and the food.
And the manager standing right there. Most tables are dirty, food on the floor. Who cleans this place?"}
{"text":"Great chicken as usual! I was in town for a conference down the road at the mayo clinic so I stopped by for a quick bite. Gluten free options are their specialty! I ordered a meal of grilled nuggets, fries and seltzer (seltzer was free). Quick service and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Always the best chicken in town! Love that their French fries are prepared on a dedicated fryer making great for me being gluten free. If the drive through line is long I just park and go in for quick service. All the staff are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Always reliably good food.

Chicken is always juicy and tender, veggies are fresh, sauce selection is superb. 

For gluten-free, opt for the lettuce wrapped char-grilled chicken sandwich. The waffle fries are fried in a dedicated fryer, so they are gf too!

Friendly staff and clean location."}
{"text":"I've been to fast food joints and I would never write a yelp review about them, because after all they are fast food joints and to me they are all about 1 star. But I'm gonna go ahead and go over the top with this Chick-Fil-A location simply because the service is as friendly as it gets. Family oriented atmosphere with service that is unbeatable. These people are nice, well-mannered, and everything is spotless. And not to mention It's hard to find a spicy chicken sandwich that has a kick and is somewhat healthy at a fast food place, but you can do so here."}
{"text":"Most amazing chicken you can get anywhere I've grown up loving Chickfila chicken and now that there's one close by where I live I live it even more! The Summer Strawberry Salad is amazing as well it has chicken with strawberries and blueberries, cheese and granola! So yummy for my tummy! The only thing is they are a very religious franchise and they close on Sundays to honor their values ...which sadly is usually the day I most desire to eat there. Bummer but its all good. If its your FIRST TIME just order an original #1 chicken sandwhich make sure you have the special HONEY BBQ SAUCE and you will be dreaming all day wondering what you've been eatting all ur life! Next stop in I will be ordering a platter of chicken bits!! Oh yeah:)

{"text":"I'm not one to review fast food stores, however this Chick-fil-A has really surprised me with their quality of service and attention to detail. You can tell that the employees here are very committed to their work and respect their jobs, as well as the managers. It's not only the fresh food that keeps me coming back, but it's also the exemplary service from the entire team working here. I experienced wonderful hospitality from Mrs. Margeri today. Also wanted to give a huge shout out to the drive thru process here. With the volume y'all receive at lunch it's truly impressive that you can get a customer through the drive thru in less than 5 minutes. Huge props!"}
{"text":"Went here today for first time. Can't figure out what all The hypes about? It's an expensive basic chicken sandwich. I'll stick with Canes.
Sandwich, fries and drink was $10.
Traffic around place and lines are still long after 3 weeks. Workers are very pleasant. This location has 175 employees so very good for economy gotta give them credit for that."}
{"text":"Just had the best experience at his place! Love that they have a little house for when the line gets backed up and they have to send a person out in the heat to help. The manager on duty (lady with long hair and glasses) was so sweet! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"I love chick til a to start off but this is not a good location. I've been here a few times and never had a good experience. One time my bread was moldy and this last time our sandwiches and fries were ice cold. Not to mention, the employees were laughing at us the whole time and making us very uncomfortable. Love chick fil a just not this location."}
{"text":"Went there at 11:45am for lunch on opening day.They had there stuff together! Took 5 to 10 min tops to order/pay/get my food. The employees running out orders too the cars were working so hard to get people there food quickly. The food was great as always! Good job Chick-fil-a/Employees/Management you guys got your Chicken together!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chick-Fil-A. Polite, friendly service. Excellent food. The chicken strips are always perfectly cooked (other locations tend to be over done). The chicken soup is perfect when under the weather and a bowl is big enough for two servings. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm a chick fil a addict. This location does very well with professionalism and quality food. The play place is very nice and clean. The service is quick and very responsive to my wants. We are very happy with this location."}
{"text":"On the way back to Buffalo from Nashville via car, we stopped in this Chick-fil-A. Now, I love Chick-fil-A and this one totally exceeded my expectations. Great parking, which is always a plus, great service and staff who was really on their A-game. My drink and sauce were forgotten, but the second I mentioned it, I had them within seconds. 

Can't really go wrong with Chick-fil-A, and this hasn't changed that notion."}
{"text":"How many restaurants can you go to during the lunch rush hour and leave with a smile?! This Chick-fil-A is ON POINT! Always well staffed and runs like an oiled machine...but with such genuine care for individual customers.  I can't call out any individual staff members as being particularly awesome because they ALL are! Taking my 3 year old is an absolute pleasure! A staff member opened the door for us on arrival and exit and stopped by our table to make sure we had everything we needed. They proactively brought us a kids table mat, extra napkins, and hand sanitizer wipes. This is a mom's dream! 
Even when they are jam packed - they clear tables at lightening speed and make sure everyone feels taken care of. Great customer service goes a long way! The food is always delicious here too. Just adore that they offer REALLY good / fresh fruit as a side. My little man always chooses fruit here because it is consistently delicious - and he knows he can always steal one of mom's waffle fries! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Location is very well positioned and convenient. The staff are friendly and the food is good. The host, Dan, was outstanding and made us feel at home. I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Even though this location is in the Ross Park Mall Food Court, they still represent Chick-Fil-A well!  Their staff is very friendly and have never gotten my order wrong.  They even come out into the food court to see if you'd like a refill on your drink!  You definitely don't see that from any of the other food vendors in the food court.  The food is yummy AND you get great service!

*FYI - they are closed on Sundays"}
{"text":"Great attitudes and the perfect atmosphere. What a joy it is to actually order a chicken sandwich at 10 AM and not be told that you cannot have it. What a great example of customer service delivering what a client wants. From the manager that convinced me to download the Chick-fil-A app to the associates being kind and friendly, thank you for always making my visit a great pleasure!"}
{"text":"Chik-fil-A is a bit more expensive than most fast food places, but I don't go anywhere else for chicken -- and this Chandler/Price store in Chandler, AZ is top notch. Always excellent service, staff very friendly, food ordered comes out perfectly. You guys are doing something right! Great job."}
{"text":"Years ago, I worked at Monroeville Mall and ate at the Chik-fil-a there, several times a week.....always loved it.  I have not been to any Chik-fil-a in years but have noticed the huge drive-thru line at this location and thought 'mmmm I miss Chik-fil-a'.......soooooo......I stopped today and went thru the drive-thru. What a terrible disappointment.  No one at home had ever had it, so I got 4 chicken sandwiches, 2 waffle fries and 2 12 piece nuggets.....NO ONE LIKED ANYTHING I got. We ended up giving it to the dogs. (btw, the dogs give it 5 stars).....as for the 3 of us humans....we would rate it less than 1 star, if possible. The waffle fries were totally not done.....they were gross, light colored, not cooked and were the texture of a sponge.....a flavorless sponge....terrible...the nuggets were greasy and hard, the sandwiches were on really soggy buns and the breading was stuck to the bun, leaving the chicken exposed.....it was all just terrible.....THIS is NOT the Chik-fil-a I remember at all....I was shocked and disappointed and felt embarrassed for having 'raved' about it to family and finally enduring the long line and bringing it home....I will say, the employees are very nice....being how bad our food was, I'm really surprised that the drive thru line wraps all the way around the building....I won't give it another try....it was really terrible and no one here wants it again."}
{"text":"Super nice staff!!  Got refills on our drinks for us!!
The food is very good too with many healthy choices. Love the chicken wrap and the fruit bowl. 
The place is very clean and they have one person who just walks around cleaning and helping customers. 
No complaints."}
{"text":"By far the worst Chic-Fil-A I have been to. It is packed, which is understandable but causes the employees to be rude and rush you through your order. I hardly had any time to put my drink, which they got wrong, in my cup holder before she was throwing my card and food at me. I got home and when I remove my sandwich from the bag and it is so the chicken burnt that it is literally crumbling into pieces out of the bun. I had ordered it with extra pickles (aside from the two that they USUALLY put on their sandwiches) and was not surprised to see one measly pickle on my singed chicken. 

A dollar chicken sandwich from McDonald's would have been more satisfying to both my appetite and wallet. I will surely be making the extra bit of a drive to the Arrowhead location from now on. Much, much better service and quality!"}
{"text":"I typically love Chick-fil-A, but this one isn't typical. Well the food was decent, and the workers were pleasant. It's evident that this one is clearly miss managed. People were waiting for things. There was problems getting people helped. Which is odd for a Chick-fil-A, because they're almost never ran that way.  The person behind the counter did a great job, the issue was she was the only person behind the counter."}
{"text":"Amazing food and super friendly and happy employees. My fav is the 6 piece nuggets...but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The only downside is they got rid of their Cole slaw about a year ago... loved that stuff."}
{"text":"Come here pretty often, usually the service is good. Tonight, though, we ordered food and forgot to ask for pepper jack. Our fault, but ordered the cheese and had to wait for it to come to the table. 10 minutes later still no cheese. My girlfriend went up to the counter to ask for it. Riley was very nice. She was the only one really doing anything. Had a long line and everyone else was just standing around behind her. When asked for the cheese she apologized and asked a girl with red hair and glasses. (Sorry missed her name) she immediately gave attitude. She responded with \"ok\" and then proceeded to take a tray of food to another table before just getting the single slice of cheese. Not a huge issue but the attitude will make us visit another location from now on."}
{"text":"The lemonade tastes like soap was in it. The chicken looked old. I went around 7:30pm on Thursday Sept 28th. It wasn't as clean as most Chic-fil-A's. Just a sub pare experience all the way around."}
{"text":"I was curious on what the hype this place generated was about.  There opening drew large crowds.  Waited a few weeks and the crowds didn't lessen much.  Endured the wait (which wasn't that bad) and grabbed a sandwich.  Nothing spectacular to be honest.  Had better meals at other venues that offered similar cuisine.  My wife thought the same.  Neither great nor bad, it was just ok."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Good lord. They tell us that they gave our order to someone else. No big deal. 15 mins later?? THANKS!! Quality is sub par. Cleanliness: NASTY. Your trash bin is literally connected to the condiments. Who came up with this design? Last time I ever eat your greasy, overpriced food. Oh and an order of fries is supposed to be 1/2 full? Thanks but you can keep your chicken."}
{"text":"If you come for fries just know they don't fill anything up all the way... Basically the same idea as a bag of air."}
{"text":"I come here like every week I love it SO much fav restaurant ever. Isaiah is the nicest server ever, he gave us a lot of chick fil a sauce and was the sweetest. Isaiah if you're reading this thank you so much you are appreciated."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love chik fil a, and I'm not always one to complain. The last 3 times I've went to this location my order was missing something or messed up. Bummer because I live close by"}
{"text":"Best chicken ever! Fast service great coffee and the freebies are awesome!!!!!!!! Favorite place to stop in the morning for breakfast love the bagel"}
{"text":"This was the first time coming to this establishment. And I was not disappointed! Chicken and biscuit breakfast was fantastic. My daughter has been begging to go here so I had to buy her lunch and bring it to her school, Surprise!!!! Needless to say she was excited. The food arrived fast like it should. I went in to order, place was clean, help was friendly and the girl behind counter recommended there signature sauce which was great. What more could I ask for."}
{"text":"The food is consistenly good here and even when it's busy, the drive thru moves fast.  This is one fast food chain that's got its act together."}
{"text":"This is a Chick-fil-A so you should know what it is about. Never had any issues here the food is always good and fairly quick for how busy this place is. I have been to bad Chick-fil-As but this place is a good one."}
{"text":"I come to this Chick Fil A often because of their great customer service and attention to detail. 
But today I am disappointed. 
I ordered the superfood salad as I was leaving my full time job to go to my part time job so I'd have something to snack on and not be hungry until I get off. 
Well when I got here I noticed my salad is completely dry! Anyone that's had the superfood salad knows it's prepared with a delicious tangy dressing that's almost addictive. 
So now I don't have anything edible to eat for dinner. Eating raw kale will choke the life outta you! 
I called the store to speak with a manager and no one answered after a dozen rings. 
Not good Chick Fil A. Not good! 
#hungry and #disappointer"}
{"text":"Incredibly clean, friendly and fresh. First time here and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Love chick-fil-A but I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and only got 1 today. Luckily they didn't charge me for 2. Guess it was just miscommunication still love this place though. Seriously Chick-Fil-A sauce is a gift from the Mormon gods."}
{"text":"First and last time my wife and I will be eating at Chik -fil-A.   Nothing spectacular about their meal.  The sweetened iced tea was warm and probably had 20 teaspoons of sugar in it.  I couldn't drink it.  Mentioned it to the manager and his reply was shrugging his shoulders and saying that that was the recipe."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and quality control...

I go to this location at least once a week to pick up food for my office. They are literally the worst at order accuracy that I have ever experienced. Beyond that they are smug and rude when you try to let them know that they forgot food / messed up the order. I would say 8 out of 10 times I have visited this location something is missing or VERY wrong (as in things that i didnt even order replaced what i wanted...). They have given me a different customers order more than once, and forgotten sandwiches, fries, and sauces almost every time. Usually when i pick up office lunch here i end up having to go back and pick up something they screwed up. The last time I had to drive back to get a missing sandwich i was greeted very rudely and offered a \"free small soda\" to compensate wasting my lunch break. I called corporate to let them know and they just wanted to send me free coupons... Its not about getting free stuff... FIX YOUR STAFF!!!!!! I will never come back to this location if i am order for more than myself.. i do not feel like checking multiple bags to see if the order is correct (isnt that why im paying for my food???), at least when its just me i only have to peek in one bag (and by the way that is wrong more often than not as well).. 


Moral of the story : Don't use this location for large orders / catering.. they are barley keeping it together."}
{"text":"We aren't special enough to have a Chick-Fil-A in Alaska, where I am from. I was recently introduced since relocating down to society... I can't believe I have missed out on this for so long!!! Hands-down, the BEST \"fast food\" I have ever had! 

Not once, has any employee failed to be kind & courteous. Always extremely polite & patient (since I was entirely unfamiliar w/ the menu or what to order). I really appreciated some suggestions! I love the variety, and that they also offer some pretty amazing salads on top of their less than \"healthy\" options- but those options are a great treat to indulge in every so often because they actually taste FRESH instead of processed, frozen & re-heated crap you can get anywhere else (like the McDonalds next door who always looks so extremely sad they have a whopping 1 vehicle in line while Chick-Fil-A's line is wrapping around the entire parking lot of BOTH establishments). Haha. Kind of amusing. 

But all in all, I just really like this establishment. They have good food, their service is by far better than other competitors, and it is a place I never feel too guilty indulging in- not your ordinary fast food chain, and in a way worth complimenting! 

I just kind of wish they would have their variety of sauces out to select from like you can easily grab some ketchup, salt/pepper or whatnot... that is my only \"complaint\", is that it is generally pretty busy to where it actually DOES seem like somewhat of an inconvenience to have to ask an employee to go retrieve any type of condiment aside from ketchup. Yeah, I get it that some people are greedy & will go scoop up an entire bin of their awesome Chick-Fil-A sauce to tote home w/ them... but why not just have an employee keeping an eye on the \"extras\" station like they are so good at coming around asking if you'd like a refill? Maybe I wanted a side of honey mustard, too, not just one sauce... can we please have access instead of having to badger someone? It doesn't need to be like the clown next door that goes to the length of CHARGING for sauce on top of already hoarding it like the Heinz plant might shut down without notice. But, at least they provide the NICE Heinz ketchup (squeeze or dip pouches) & a legit selection of their OWN variety... yes, to some of us, things like that matter & are appreciated! 

Either way- they have never been slow. Never gotten an order wrong. Always been incredibly polite. And always made sure to acknowledge gratitude for my business. Glad to work in the vicinity of a pretty decent place to grab lunch (sometimes breakfast) every so often!"}
{"text":"Did y'all really make this chicken noodle soup with old breaded chicken? Like chuncks of fried chicken in the chicken noodle soup-which normally grilled chicken. Which I assumed was made fresh. Just a little off putting for chik fil a standards...."}
{"text":"Only the best chicken sandwiches are served here. Pretty good iced coffee too! Although, it tends to be quite crowded here and small for a chik fil A."}
{"text":"Bad food - bad service. The chicken salad sandwich made the roof of my mouth hurt because the bread was so hard and dry.  I had to repeat myself numerous times before they got my order \"right@, then it still came out wrong."}
{"text":"Slowest Chick-Fil-A I have ever been to. I love Chick-Fil-A, and before moving to Gastonia, ate it at least twice a week. This particular store isn't worth the effort. I sat in the drive thru for 25 minutes. I couldn't even get out of line to leave because of the way the parking lot is set up, and the amount of people that were there. The food was ok, but even my sandwich was a little over cooked and dry. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This is extreme to have to yelp. But it's that bad. Simple problem: wife is allergic to pickles. 3 out or 4 visits had pickles on her chicken sandwich. Wasted money since we live 5 mles away. Called the 3rd time. Mgr Said too busy to talk to me. I left my name and number. No call back. Called again, no mgr available. Placed an online complaint. No call back. Just received an email asking how my complaint was resolved. Filled out survey saying it was never resolved. No call back. At all. From anyone. You turned a simple complaint that was your fault into a loss of $80 a week on sales. Good job chick-fil-a. I'm completely done and so is my family. I hope you reprimand and terminate your terrible regional and general manager. They don't care about their customers obviously. I tried 5 times now, with not one call back. The survey asking how my complaint was resolved ess the biggest slap in the face. Not cool."}
{"text":"Best fast food in the biz imo.  Uptown location's service is impressive.  Hit lunch rush @ 12:30...line was easily 25+ deep.  In & out in 5 minutes.  Nailed my order (special requests to boot).  A++++++++"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. What's not to love? Good food, fast friendly service, awesome location.......and, best of all, business dedicated to the Lord.......Praise Him. They also have many promotions where they give away menu items."}
{"text":"Right as I walked into this Chick-fil-A I felt very comfortable. The red setting made me feel very warm. The red setting also gave a very satisfying feeling while I ate my warm chicken nuggets with Chick-fil-A sauce. The setting also gives off a very family friendly environment. Overall the choice of colors and the interactions from the workers game my experience a positive outcome.

While on the topic of food I would like to say for the few extra dollars you spend, you get much greater quality comparing to McDonald's. After sports games and on the weekends I love going to Chick-fil-A for a quick, warm, and overall delicious lunch. Chick-fil-A's food quality totally blows my out of the water when you take into consideration it a fast food restaurant! I would 100% go to Chick-fil-A over any other fast food restaurant.

The overall food quality is great. The fast service is exactly where it needs to be. Also the interaction and the attitude of the works is outstanding. Chick-fil-A is a 5/5 star fast food restaurant for me. Every time I walk out I always have a smile on my face and I bet you will too!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy deluxe chicken sandwich and it was very good and flavorful for a fast food chain.   It's nice that they don't put any dressing on it so you can decide what you want and the amount you want on your own. 

The waffle fries were good but the salt level really varied between fries.  Some fries were not salty and some were super salty."}
{"text":"i want to know why ??? i get wicked diarrhea every time i eat at chickfila ????  its not just this chickfila its all the chickfilas!!!!  but this one is the worst  we are always sick with  diarrhea every time we eat here!!!!  we will not keep coming back at this point !!! maybe the health department needs to check it out !!!!!!!!!  chickfila is disgusting these days !!!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between Costco and Starbucks I got hungry, and I didn't want samples. I spotted Chick Fil A on my way to get my afternoon caffeine fix, I said to my self, \"oh sure why not\" Now it's been years since I ate there, last time was in Metro Center and I wasn't quite impressed.  

First of Parking sucks here, especially with a full sized truck but I ended up across in front of Verizon since I'm still able to walk. I spotted three employees at the corner of the building, and figured that's where the entrance was, so in I went. 

This place rocks. I wasn't more than 5 feet inside the store and I was greeted by a young man manning the registers, \"not bad\" I told my self. There was another couple in front and an older lady stepped up and took my order. I went for the #2 and thought to my self it was gonna be another BK, McD's type of chicken patty. I ordered was given a cone and started to find a seat, must've wandering around for about 30 seconds before I chose a seat but by that time my meal was ready. 

The chicken \"patty\" was an entire chicken breast!!!! Nuff said. From a guys prospective, its a done deal, leave me alone, I'm eating, who cares about the decor....I'm eating. 

Customer Service at this place rocks, they're the QT and Safeway of fastfood. Its clean, friendly and just awesome. 

Know what? I'm going back next week, shoot, maybe even tomorrow."}
{"text":"Make sure to check your order before you leave the Drive-Thru. For the last couple of times I was there, they forgot to include an item, add salad dressing, add salad toppings. Very frustrating!"}
{"text":"Update:  I've been here 20 times now. It's quite good. If you like this chain's food, you'll like this one. 


This is pretty good. If you have visited many Chick Fil A restaurants, this one is overall a bit less good. 

Service is decent, on par when standard fast food, but below a \"real\" Chick Fil A. Not sure who owns this franchise but it might have airportitis, where they sort of know they don't have to try real hard since they have a captive audience. 

The standards chicken sammy is good, but the chicken mini biscuits are off a bit, especially the biscuit parts."}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru here the other day, but we were still greeted by a friendly voice (who turned out to be just as friendly at the paying window). We didn't wait too long and were on our way in minutes. Two kids meals and one adult meal came to almost $16, which seems kind of high for fast food. Then again, I rarely do the fast food thing. 

Anyways, really good food, nice service."}
{"text":"After a long day at work and didn't feel like cooking dinner so I decided to pick up some Chick-Fil-A on my way home. I get there around 6:30 to a FULL drive-thru. After waiting almost 15mins in the drive-thru line alone I get to order and quickly get my food. I pull out of the plaza and stop less than a block away at a red light so I decide to check my food. I clearly noticed I had someone else's order because it was not even close to mine. I make and immediate u-turn and return to the still very long drive-thru line. I finally get to the order speaker and explain what happened. I'm asked to pull up to the window and a very youth and confused teenager tries to make it seem like I'm wrong because that's what I ordered and paid for like it said in the receipt. By now I'm steaming mad and ask for a manager. The manager with plenty of attitude takes the wrong food back and gives me my correct order. I ask her what about the difference between what I paid and what my correct order was because I noticed my correct order was less expensive. I told her I didn't need the change and asked if I could get a brownie to make up the difference they owed me + the hassle. She quickly responded something like \"the brownie is $1.39 and the difference we owe you is only $.38 cents so you will have to pay the difference plus tax.\" I was shocked and lost for words at the awful customer service I was getting from one of my favorite fast food places. After a few seconds of feeling like I was going to have a stroke from the anger I finally managed to ask for my $.38 cents back which she quickly gave to me. Since I have yet to eat at any Chick-Fil-A
because my pride don't let me give a single penny to that company. I tell this factual story to any one who will listen because I cant believe Chick-Fil-A lost a life time customer over $1.01+tax."}
{"text":"This is the worst chi-fil-a I've ever been to! They \"anticipated\" no more breakfast at 10:10 when we arrived so when my co-worker ordered they took over 18 min to give it to her and we were on a lunch break. This wasted all our time. They didn't even offer a refund! Very disappointed in the management. This service was less then one star!!!"}
{"text":"Like some, I have a love/hate relationship with Chick-fil-A. 

But I have never, ever had a problem at this location.  Everyone here is great and guess what, they're super friendly too. 

A few months ago, the Clown (Ronald McD) next door started offering a Buttermilk Chicken sandwiches.  Whoa Nellie, Kattie Bar the Door, be still my heart!  Mickey Ds selling real buttermilk chicken sandwiches?  Holy Keith Jackson!  

But no, it wasn't meant to be.  The Folks from Oakbrook are offering a half size sandwiches with mostly breadcrumbs for the same price as Chick-fil-A; and it's not as good. 

So, skip the clown and head here for the Cows: EAT MOR CHIKIN!

PS -- Send a text and will get alerts whenever they're having one of their family nights.  Nice."}
{"text":"Been going to Chick-fil-A fit a long time. One of my favorite quick lunch places. Love the nuggets, especially the fried.

In the many years I've eaten here, there have only been three times that I was given less nuggets than the twelve count I usually get. All three times they were quick to fix with fresh hot nuggets, always more to make up for the inconvenience. The service is top notch.

I sometimes take my time, and the staff is courteous and offers refills and clean up the table. Wish more restaurants offered this level of service and consistent good food."}
{"text":"Fast and fairly broad menu. Ordered a Market Salad. Fresh made, had seasonal berries in tbe mix. Too much 'fried' on menu for my personal preferences, however, having said thst, the salad was over the top awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome service & it's always my go to fast-food choice. Chicken is always crispy as are the fries."}
{"text":"We were those rude consumers that walked in 15 mins before they closed and stayed to eat in their lobby. I usually hate those consumers but I appreciate that they didn't kick us out or gave us attitude even when we seemed to have been taking our time to eat.

Their food seemed fresh, even close to closing. They gave us more sauce, free of charge with the amount of food we ordered. My personal favorite to dip my nuggets in are the polynesian and the garlic ranch. Don't get the honey mustard tho, it tasted fake to me ... if that even makes any sense."}
{"text":"Ordered lg coffee.   They ran out of coffee half way through my cup.  Staff said I could wait 7 minutes, \" fill the rest up with milk or I could fill the rest up with water.\"   Huh??  I asked if I could just pay for a small instead.  Staff seemed disgruntled with me.  What? Staff took my half cup coffee back, poured it in small cup (??) and handed it back.   Still not full.  Finally refunded money.      Odd.   Bizarre.   Definitely not their pleasure."}
{"text":"Took my mom out for lunch. It's her favorite place from living in Florida. And this place didn't let me down at all. It felt right at home big time. The staff was so friendly and helpful. 
    I stood in line that was out the door. Luckily they had staff on hand. They pre-took my order while waiting. And when I got to counter. All I had to do was just pay. Listen for a chicken joint it's bomb. 
    For two people with meal combos. It came to only like $14. It was good food and service. I'll be coming back for sure. Everything was made and served. In a great timely manner, the whole wait was less then 15 mins. And don't miss out on sauces for your waffle fries!"}
{"text":"Possibly the most courteous and efficient chain restaurant ever. From the reception to the food to the  service at the table this was a top-notch experience. I will go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just end up at Chick-Fil-A. Sometimes it's the best plan. Not necessarily that you're craving gourmet chicken (because gourmet it ain't) but because it's close or convenient or fast or cheap or whatever.

What they are doing right is reaching out to the community and making a local presence. They seem to focus on being a good neighbor. And all the moms I know swear by the place because it's good for kids. They have those adhesive placemats to keep junior's food off the table, they've got toys, and big playplace, and even a stool in the bathroom so kids can reach to wash their hands.

The food? That's not even a close second. I had a wrap that was grocery story quality at best. I may have ordered wrong, but the chow is pretty forgettable. Maybe nuggets next time?"}
{"text":"Rising from the ashes of the former Quiznos in the food court of Pittsburgh airport is the glorious 6 day habit of Chick-fil-A.  Expect the usual great service and remember that  you can order lunch at breakfast if you are willing to wait up to 15 minutes for them to cook your order."}
{"text":"Hi chick fil a! Can someone please respond to me and let me know what this is exactly..? I LOVE your unsweetened tea so I ordered a gallon of it the other day and when I opened it, this was on top. Looks like someone maybe hacked up some stuff into my tea..? I still went ahead and tried it and the tea tasted awful! Maybe just a bad batch? I would also like to say thank you for such great customer service! This is a picture of the manager handing people their food by the drive in window in 100 degree heat!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this location they get my orders wrong. It's really frustrating to drive from Ohio City to the closest CFA, being this one, and not get what you wanted. While the staff is mostly sweet, we've heard the phrase \"here again?\". And actually is even more ignorant considering they still get the dang order wrong. You think they'd remember, right?"}
{"text":"This is an excellent Chick-Fil-A!

I'm from Atlanta, so I know my Chick-Fil-As.  I've been to one million of them.  Comparatively, this one is excellent.  Here's why I say this:

1)  It's really big.  There's a huge parking lot.  It's landscaped outside.  It's very clean.  It's well laid-out, with lots of booths and tables.

2)  Of course the service is great.  Very nice folks work here.

3)  The food is spot-on, served hot and fairly quickly.

There is nothing here to not like.  Love it.  Eat it.  Yelp On!"}
{"text":"Awesome chik fila.  Due to the fact at lunch time they have people outside taking orders on tablets which speeds up the line. Also, they havent fucked up my order ever which is weird in clt"}
{"text":"Just like every other Chick Fil A, it was amazing! Service was super fast and the food was good. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is the fries could have been done a little more. I mean I still ate them but a little to under cooked for me. Don't let that stop you tho. I got the chicken spicy sandwich and it was spot on! (Get the special sauce)"}
{"text":"20 min in a drive thru line just to order is unacceptable, that they ran out of 2 items, if I would of known I wouldn't of came, I was stuck in line and could not go forward or reverse, bad service how does a restaurant run out of food, sounds like the food receiver isn't ordering enough food, this happened at 10:00am Saturday"}
{"text":"The best fast food service in Henderson by far!! Other fast food chains should copy their business model (seriously) 
Always polite never rude unlike Mc Ds where their service is atrocious.  Fresh food always! The best chicken sandwich in the world.  I'm very impressed with how fast the drive thru runs."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to dine in for a quick dinner. Service at the register was okay no smiles, I felt like I was more of an annoyance than a customer. I must have interrupted their conversation and nightly duties at 8pm. Food was barely warm and was delivered to the wrong table, then the customer took it back to the counter. The associate laughed and brought it over to us. Grabbed a high chair for my 1 year old and there was still a kids meal left in the chair and all greasy. Gross! Then I looked around and the floor matched the high chair food, straws and napkins all over the floor. Won't be returning to this location again

Two biggest surprises I learned today.
Food is not hot or fresh when you dine in.
Food is not thrown out when it's delivered to the wrong table and another customer put there hands on your food."}
{"text":"This location is closest to my home so I used to get the chick-fil-a sandwich until I learned there is some dairy.  I'm not anti-dairy, but my nursling has an allergy so I have to be careful.  

The dude who knocked off stars for it being fast food should have his review deleted.  I don't go to a jewelry store looking for tires. Unbelievable.

It's a darn tasty sandwich!  Fries are good too!  And I would have given them 5 stars BUT the super nice mgr at the Chick-fil-A near the Airport made mine special -WITHOUT the egg/milk wash.  When I asked the woman behind the counter here, I was told they would not. 

But if you're being careful with dairy and soy it's best to avoid eating out altogether."}
{"text":"Great food, large CLEAN dining area, cheerful & helpful staffers. A+ even for Chick-fil-A which has never been below B+ in all the ones we've dined at."}
{"text":"I have been to this location about a dozen times since opening. The chicken sandwiches at lunch are better than the breakfast ones. The waffle fries are usually cooked just right. The breakfast hash rounds aren't always cooked correctly. They have either been just right or not done enough and too greasy. The biscuit used for the breakfast sandwich has a nice flavor, but falls apart very easily when you take a bite. Which can be a pain especially if you're driving. The staff is pleasant. And I know them saying my pleasure every time a customer says thank you is their thing, but it can be very robotic and not genuine when they say it too much during the transaction. Another small attention to detail would be to wipe the cup off before handing it over. I've had numerous drinks with soda dripped down the side of the cup."}
{"text":"I've been to numerous chic fil a restaurants across the phoenix metro and this one by far has the fastest service, friendliest staff, and freshest food. the lobby was being immaculately maintained by Drew, who was unrelenting in making sure my family's dinner was going well, stopping at nothing to clean around the table, and reload our sauces and drinks. we were very pleased with his and the rest of the staff's most excellent service. above and beyond your average chic fil a location!"}
{"text":"Staff is outstanding (as usual). There is a problem this morning with their biscuits. All of ours are hard and really almost inedible. We did have to wait for our sandwiches (expected them to be fresh...not hard and stale) and they must've boxed up our hash Browns first because they were cold."}
{"text":"I rarely eat at fast food restaurants, but needed something quick one night last week.  We stopped in and ordered at the counter and sat down outside with our dog.  The staff quickly brought out our fresh food and checked back in with us a few times to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.  The restaurant is quite clean, open and bright and the staff are very well trained in customer service."}
{"text":"Food is what you would expect. However I did not expect to be waiting over 20 minutes in the drive through line just to get my food. And once I got home I realized that they messed up my order - I ordered a deluxe chicken sandwich with everything on it and the only thing that was on it was the chicken and cheese. Very disappointed in their lack of customer service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"The food was ok, don't know why people are so crazy about it. The service was good, the people were friendly, they were efficient, I will go back."}
{"text":"Excellent Catering!  Our company had a catered lunch from here and it was a big hit!  Plenty of food per person and everyone was happy to have the infamous Chick-Fil-A."}
{"text":"The food, the people, the location!!!  All are perfect!  We have been a few times and I have zero complaints.  I live closer to the one in Eastern but this location is a lot better.  I am pretty stoked to keep coming and get my chicken fill each week!  Being from California, I've missed this place and I am so happy it's finally in Nevada.  I would recommend the chicken sliders for breakfast and the chicken nuggets or chicken fingers for lunch!"}
{"text":"Was not the experience I expected. Breakfast burrito had more peppers and onions than eggs. Chicken biscuits and minis were dry. Didn't have a good variety of sodas or menu items that we are used to. We were told,\"well the owner doesn't like the spicy chicken or rootbeer so we don't serve them here.\" Really?! I was so disappointed in this place. If we weren't traveling, I would have done back and asked for a refund."}
{"text":"\"EAT MORE CHICKIN\" and this is the place to do it.  A clean and spotless atmosphere with a well trained and friendly staff!  Eating here is a pleasant and satisfying experience!!!"}
{"text":"Par for the course for Chick-Fil-A. It's fast, friendly and efficient service. The food is good too.

Always packed!! Family friendly!"}
{"text":"Packed as per usual because there is only 2 spots in Vegas. 
The drive through and the in store eat in lines are disgustingly long and expect to wait between 15-40 min on average especially on the weekend.

CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH: HUGE HUGE HUGE TIP- USE THE MOBILE APP- it takes 3-5min to register and add your credit card, then when you pull up like when my hubby and I did on a Saturday, your wait will be 5 min instead of the long time u need to usually wait. 

Best best best idea ever to get the app and preorder your order- only downside of the app is that you can't grab all the goodies like the extra sauces/honey/Mayo because the app limits you to 3 items per order. 
Also make sure, make sure you press on the app- the IM HERE button or else you will just sit in the car- that way they know to make ur order when ur pulling up.

There was no line in the mobile pick up.

Best best best way to grab Chick-a-fil when your craving it."}
{"text":"Break fast rush can mean you are waiting for a little bit. Chicken is tastes and fresh when it comes out. Their chicken breast bisects are amazing."}
{"text":"My daughter loves it, but I cannot stand the food, the noise, or the horrible parking."}
{"text":"Went in this morning and ordered for dine in with my son. They took my name and gave me my drinks. I noticed as I sat down they were not calling names but rather bringing out food wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out who ordered what. After 15 minutes I went to the counter and let them know I had not received my food. No apology just blank looks as if they had no idea how to handle. Stood there for a little while longer as they talked among themselves and I finally just left. I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Remember to always check your order before pulling away from drive thru, I learned that lesson today. I ordered a Cobb salad for lunch they didn't give me my dressing. I live too far away to have gone back to get it. I also wish they put more care in preparing their salad. It had more stems then leaves in it. I really didn't enjoy it. This is what I get for being lazy and opting to buy a salad instead make one at home."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the Mall at Robinson and were planning to go to the location inside, but decided to go here instead.

It was around 2pm on a Monday and was pretty busy, but the line moved fast. By the time we ordered, they were able to give us our food before we even got our drinks, lucky us.

It's clean, service is friendly, and the fried chicken of course is outstanding! We got a Chick Fil A Deluxe and a Spicy Deluxe, the lettuce, tomatoes and cheese give the sandwich extra flavor. Oh, but how can I forget about the pickles? There's just something about pickles and fried chicken that just works.  

My waffle fries weren't as crispy as I expected, could've been some extras left over from the lunch rush, but nevertheless I still enjoyed them. Try them with mayo for something extra tasty!"}
{"text":"I do mobile orders for my coworkers and myself a few times a month. Usually it's great service. Today, the lady behind the counter shoved a bag at the lady standing next to me without saying anything. Turns out it was my order without any of the drinks. Then I stood for 5 min trying to get someone's attention for my drinks. The short lady with the black hair in a pony tail acted like I was inconvenient to HER. I did not like her tone. She kept talking over me when I was trying to explain I was missing drinks. Then she wanted me to pay for the .60 cream cheese that I didn't realize cost money (which I was totally okay with paying for). But she walked away before I could even attempt to explain I needed to pay through the app because my card was in the car. Then she waved her hands at me dismissing me when she finally came back around. Will think twice next time we place a group order. Not used to s**t service from chick fil a."}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich in town... it was super busy lines out the door and still everything came out quick"}
{"text":"I don't agree with Chick-Fil-A's politics, but I really agree with their food. Love the chicken, love love love the fries.  I understand this isn't a 5-star fancy pants restaurant, but this place really does deserve 5 stars in the fast food realm.  The place looks fabulous (in comparison to other fast food joints), is super clean, and the workers are all happy and go out of their way to help."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is always good, but this location is awesome. I'd like to do a study on their training program and corporate culture and this is the location where I'd start. \"Oh, my pleasure!\" See how many times you can hear that when making an order through the drive-thru. 

Oh yeah, and the food is good too! I don't know what they do to the chicken breasts they make their sandwiches with, but man they are good! I'm addicted to the spicy chicken sandwich. Let's face it, nothing fried is \"healthy\" but using fresh ingredients, peanut oil (cholesterol free and no trans fats) is a good start; and they do have truly healthy offerings if you want to go that route (sorry, no waffle cut fries on that menu!)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite of these restaurants! The staff here is super friendly and the service is fast and consistent. Their iced coffee is delicious as well! I'm definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This Chick-Fil-A is in a prime spot.  It's in the Steele Creek area in front of the Target complex.  There are a lot of walk-through shops in this plaza and this whole area is aesthetically pleasing.
This particular Chick-fil-a has a lengthy drive-thru line, making it less crowded when you're in their long line.  But you better be dedicated to the trip because once you place your order, you cannot back out of the drive-thru line.  It's one lane and no exit.
The folks at this place have always been very friendly when we come through."}
{"text":"Great service
Great food
Quick drive-thru
Definitely one of the best chickfilas I have been to. Lives up to the strong chick-fil-a reputation that I have come to expect. Only fast food restaurant I will eat at."}
{"text":"This is the first review I've ever left for a company and it is well warranted. I've been a customer here for a few years and have never had anything but a great experience, recently there was customer service issue that was neither the fault of myself or the employee and I took it to the owner, Chris, not too sure how to handle it. Chris handled it with absolute class and I can say confidently he is a very high character individual. This is why Chick Fil A is head and shoulders above its competitors and people like Chris allow them to separate themselves from the rest. His integrity and the work ethic of his staff is far and away the best I have experienced, and that is why they deserve 6 stars, but 5 is the maximum allowed. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by my first trip to this Chic fil a. I was hesitant due to the busy location to visit it. This couldn't have been further wrong. The entrance and access way was simple. The parking was plentiful. They had several registers open and I couldn't decide what I wanted before I was being asked for help. The counter staff was very courteous,  very good at their job and very pleasant. As this was our first time eating inside a Chic fil a,  the staff and manager that was overseeing them explained that we could take a seat. They would gladly bring our food to the table. Refreshing. We were asked if they could refill our drinks, which they did to my surprise. They also came and asked how everything was. The store was very clean as was the restroom. The food was fantastic, as all members of my family could attest. I couldn't have had a better fast food experience that didn't feel like a fast food experience."}
{"text":"This is your typical mall type of Chick-fil-A establishment located in the food court area found practically in every mall. 

Usually get the Grilled Chicken Market salad, find that the salads are okay versus the one's that I get at the stand alone Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had at a Chick-fil-A. I bought an ice cream cone and the employee made a cone then used a napkin to wipe off the top half of the ice cream, not sure why. I was handed a very sloppy cone that had napkin crumbs on the top.  I then asked the manager to switch the cone with a proper one and she (the manager!!) gave me a lot of attitude for the request."}
{"text":"I ordered a large fries (pictured) and got a super under-filled ''large'' fries. I wish I opened it at the Chick-fil-A because I might as well have ordered a small or medium. I'm very disappointed, I could go to any other fast food restaurant and pay much less for double the fries. I come to Chick-fil-A for quality but I did not get what I paid for."}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-a, but this location has terrible customer service. I stopped here in my lunch break they forget the bacon on my sandwich so I went inside to tell them about it they replaced it after having a long discussion with the \"manager\". I went back to my car running later to find a cold burger tossed together. I decided to get a refund the refused to refund me until I went back to my car to get the drink I ordered. Horrible service, manager was extremely rude!!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Chick-fil-a and I've never really had any issues that I can think of. Unfortunately, after two failed attempts at getting things right in one week I have to say I am disappointed. 

I regularly use the One app to order lunch since I'm usually on a time crunch to get back to work. Luckily the app has the curbside delivery option for receiving your food when parking in a designated spot... not the case at this location. Last week I used this feature and the app indicated my food was ready. I waited for over 5 minutes for someone to bring the food out and no one came. I went inside, stated I used the curbside feature and was waiting on my food. They apologized and picked the food up from behind the counter and gave it to me. The food was sitting there the entire time. Fast forward to today.. I tried using the feature again and yet again, same situation. No one ever brought my food out and it apparently was never going to be brought out either. I waited 5 minutes in the car just to make sure I gave them ample time. 

What frustrates me is the fact that this feature is great for professionals on a lunch break and a time crunch. However, I've wasted more time going inside, waiting for someone to help, and then receiving my food afterwards. I've never had a problem with this feature at any other Chick-fil-a except this location. This definitely needs to be fixed and addressed."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food place! Love the quality of food, the friendly staff, and the clean environment. Original chicken sandwich is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review to start off with. I literally downloaded Yelp just to write this.  I went to this Chick-Fil-A earlier and was pretty surprised went they told me my card got declined. I told them I would be right back and drove away leaving no explanation really. After leaving thru their drive thru  I realized that they had already given me our drinks.. I called back after 5 minutes and told them that I was sorry that I drove away not realizing I already got the drinks and that I was just calling the bank to see why my card got declined. They said not to worry and they understand and I told them That I was on my way back. When I got to the window they said that because I was honest and called about the drinks that they would take care of the order and I didn't have to pay for it. My heart seriously melted ..not because of the money but because of the act of kindness from these 2 specific girls (I should have gotten their name.) it was seriously the nicest thing that has happened to me in a long time. Just the thought of doing something so sweet and nice left such an impression on me. We have always been a fan of this restaurant but now I'm a greater fan. Thank you for having such amazing customer service ...most drive thru's can't wait to throw the food at you with no smile at all. You're employees have always left such a positive impression even before today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."}
{"text":"This is your standard Chick-Fil-A - consistently good food with friendly staff.

This Chick is located off of South Blvd in the same shopping center as a movie theater, Target, Old Navy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohl's, Michaels and a bunch of other stuff.  The traffic pattern in the center can be a bit of a cluster, but isn't that true of most shopping centers?  Coming through a little before 11:30 am on a Thursday, I drove straight up to the call box, ordered my #1, quickly paid and was on my way.  The condiments I requested were in the bag, the lack of pickles that I requested was honored and my tea was perfectly sweet.  Eat mor chikin!"}
{"text":"A recently remodeled Chick-fil-A, this is your standard line around the building, smiling teenagers in the drive-thru kinda place.  The recent remodel forces you to drive all the way around the building to queue-up, but since this place is always packed, I guess that is required.  And, while you wait, you get to enjoy the lovely waterfall around the back of the building.

The wait took a bit, but it was a long line, so it moved as quickly as possible.  I got my sack of #1 and delicious lemonade and was on my way.  As always, the Chick is a winner."}
{"text":"As I have never actually been inside of this location, I can only attest to the drive-thru service.  One of only 2 drive-thru food joints at Stonecrest, this Chick Fil A is ALWAYS slammed.  It is not unusual for the line to be completely wrapped around the building, but fear not - they are efficient at the Chick and you will have waffle fries in hand and be on your way to battle through traffic to get into or out of Stonecrest.  

This is located as soon as you turn into Stonecrest, yards from the stoplight, so getting in and out of the restaurants parking lot can be a bit of a test of patience and your horn blowing skills.  Circle all the way around the building to get into the drive-thru line.  On pretty days, they will have some poor employee, that I assume draws the short straw, outside walking up to your car window to take your order remotely.  I don't know if this is designed to make the line seem like it moves faster, or some sort of customer service \"above and beyond\" measure.   Talk into a box, talk into a human - whatevs... I just want a fried chicken sammich.  

I am a #1 girl - original sandwich, waffle fries and a drink (fried chicken breast on a buttered bun with pickles).  You can substitute other sides for an upcharge.  Every once in a while, if I am feeling particularly fat, I will get their grilled sandwich - very good for a fast food joint.  Other days when I am feeling the  homicidal rage of a full day at work, I get a brownie.  A delicious, frosted, nut-covered brownie.  Sometimes I get the meal with the cole slaw - their cole slaw is sweet and delicious, but it is the kind of slaw that is pulverized into tiny pieces - I usually like mine with bigger pieces, but theirs is very good.  

The milk shakes are delicious - in the summer months they have peach which is creamy and yum.  I have also had the banana pudding milkshake, and while the shake was delicious, I could have done without the nilla waver shavings in it (I still drank it all).

Their light lemonade is cool and refreshing. Chick also has some of the best sweet tea (sweet without being syrupy).  Their breakfast biscuits are a little too crumbly (they are hard to eat in the car and I end up with biscuit crumbs in my bra), but buttery and good.  

The food is consistent and the employees are always friendly.  Great place for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"Happy to see they put a Chick-Fil-A in this area!!! Went through the drive-through for a quick lunch pick me up, little hectic in the ordering as they just opened 2 days ago but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was a little confused - servers couldn't figure out where to deliver food and walked around for awhile with it because the plastic things they give to identify you are all so similar but clean and tasty overall."}
{"text":"Drive through is almost always quick. The customer service like always is wonderful! I've always had great visits to this chick fil a location. Clean bathrooms and super friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"I think they are afraid that people are going to take their condiments and dipping sauces home and use them as a marinade for other food or something. One the craziest things I've ever dealt with in driver through. I order all of this food with French fries and you give me two ketchups. What is wrong with these people? After the 5th time of it happening I get straight up nasty at the window. They need to get it together."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Chick-fil-a.
Soap in the bathroom smells like nasty ass."}
{"text":"I frequently visit Chic Fil A locations for their chicken nuggets, and as a someone new to Arizona, I was pleasantly surprised to find this location. The quality of the food was perfect, and the staff is welcoming, kind and courteous. I'm glad I found a little piece of home in my new surroundings"}
{"text":"I was sent to this location to order food for my office's lunch break and it was personally my first time ever being in a Chick-Fil-A. I have never been a big fan of chicken until then. Right away the customer service was excellent. The girl that helped me made my 5+ different orders extremely easy and I didn't feel rushed like I do when I go to other places, which was nice considering I was new to the place. I waited for the order a reasonable amount of time and was headed back to work quickly! The order was near perfect as they only forgot a honey mustard for one of the orders. I am now a loyal Chick-Fil-A customer and will definitely return on my own time. Thanks for the awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Year ago I could not be happier with the food and service I received. Oh well that was then. But at least the management corrected the mistakes."}
{"text":"The best is the spicy chicken sandwich. The drive thru goes shockingly quick, and they will bring food to your table if you eat inside."}
{"text":"Found a bug in my drink, let manager Joshua know About the bug, offered me a refill from the same ice bin the bug came from, cool thx"}
{"text":"I have never experienced bad service at a Chic Fil A until I visited this one. I ordered s salad which they put in a small bag. When I asked for a bigger bag, the girl handed me the bag and when I said \"thank you\" she didn't even respond. 

Today I went through the drive thru and ordered nuggets. When I asked what sauces they have other than bbq & ranch the girl rolled her eyes before answering. 

This is not the treatment I expect from Chick Fil A. I will not be visiting this location in the future."}
{"text":"I just want to thank the staff and everyone for the as always 5 Star Service and incredible quality of Chick Fil A chicken that I had about 7 times while in Charlotte staying at The Hilton nearby. I got a Gallon of Sweet Ice Tea every time and if someone questioned why I loved it, I made them try it and they would be getting their own very shortly. Again, the best service and best product out there, no question about it."}
{"text":"Another RELATIVE rating. It doesn't get much better for a CHAIN restaurant than Chick-Fil-A. The service is always friendly, professional, polite and quick. Gotta love their chicken. Nice thing is that they have healthier options like grilled chicken....just skip the cheese and bacon and mayo....and fries. But their waffle fries are really good, especially with their famous \"Chick-Fil-A Sauce!\""}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the food, I'm sad to give a bad review.

But, the last 4 times, they screwed up our order in the drive through.

I'm sad...I love the food, but they just can't seem to get it right. :("}
{"text":"This is review for their drive through. 
What is it about Chick-fil-A? No matter if it is for breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack or dinner. The drive through are always packed at the drive through. 

They have a system here that is like you wish this was the standard protocol at every drive through.
Two girls out with an ipad walking to cars to greet them and ask for your order with a beautiful smile. Drive further down. A woman rings you ups- Life does not get any better than this. By the time you get to the actual drive through window, they hand you your soft drinks, bag of heavenly treats, and sends you on your merry way.

Talk about customer service, point of interaction and transaction. KA- BOOM! Restaurants and retailers can use some of Chick-fil-A training on customer service. That's why they are Number #1 and even bypass Kentucky Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"What can I say. I love Chick-fil-A was so excited to see one down here in the Third/Fourth Ward. What a let down... :-(

This is not your typical Chick-fil-A. This is an express one. Very different than your regular Chick-fil-A restaurants. This place was not busy or packed thinking that in this area is busier during the week from Mon-Friday versus the weekend which they are not even open here.

First time here, walked in. One staff busy putting away condiments and another behind the food counter. Not real friendly here. So use to a Hello or Welcome at every single Chick-fil-A I been to. This is what you do here- get stuff, bag it, and ask them to ring you up. There are no trays here. Make sure you do not hold too much stuff or you be dropping things.

The fries are placed out in a bin/tray with heated lamps above, and chicken already in bags and placed out for patrons to help themselves (no idea how long they sitting out there). Saw chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets. Fridge close by with stack of three small salads.

Wonder if the food is actually cooked here or just reheated.

Bags lined up by the cash register. Went to asked the guy busy putting away condiments or fixing that area. \"Is this a grab, go and check yourself out\"? He goes yes.

Chicken sandwich was dry. Like I said who know how long the chicken is sitting out there. Was there at 1:30 PM.

This is a stand alone store. No drive through.

Will not be back. Rather go to a real Chick-fil-A restaurant than an express one.

Express places in NYC are so much nicer. Very popular. Life in the fast lane in NYC, people are nicer and interact with their customers. Ask them if they need assistance when they look confused."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Chick-Fil-A. After placing an order staff member asked us where we were seating and came over with the salads. The food is delcious. Trying to eat healthy which is difficult for the waffle fries are the bomb.

Chicken Market Salad is freshly made. Nice blend of fruits with mixed salad. I just hold the dressing and the nut toppings so I feel better about being on diet. Do not tell anyone about the blue cheese."}
{"text":"I'll probably ruffle some feathers with this review since most people are pretty passionate about Chick-Fil-A; however this wasn't too good.

As usual I'll try to start with the good.  Chick-Fil-A's are usually very clean and that's no exception here and it boasted a 96 sanitation grade.  They have a few healthy options like salads, fruit cups, and grilled chicken.  The employees are friendly, but it's in an annoying an obvious corporate-mandated way.  \"My pleasure\" is half of what you'll hear from the employees.

Now onto the food itself...blah.  For $7 and a 10 minute wait I got a small, sad, dry chicken sandwich without much flavor, a small fruit cup, and a fountain soda.

Sorry Chick-Fil-A, if I spend $7 it will be at Jersey Mike's where the meat is fresh and delicious - not reheated like this."}
{"text":"The staff here is just absolutely amazing! Look for Donnie or Sierra; I consider them to be the two friendliest people there!
Many of the food choices are not only DELICIOUS, but healthy as well!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me so much of In and Out Burger, in the sense that it is run by young, smiley, happy people. I have been going there for years since the day they opened and still not a bad experience. They are fast, cordial and care to provide great service, and fresh hot food. Always great! I also always appreciate their mailers. They're very generous with their promotions. I have gotten coupons for free chicken sandwiches, no purchase necessary. I always appreciate that. Lately I'm enjoying some of the new items in the menu. They just keep on bringing me back. And did you know they got a breakfast coffee drink mixed with ice cream? Yum!"}
{"text":"this place gets a star only by default!!  the staff horrible!!  the food bland we came here a couple weeks ago and the service was horrible kelsey was working drive thru and she sucks!  i mean how hard is it working the drive thru???  not very!!  whatever i asked for she fave the opposite.  the when we get to the window to grab food the fly the bag at me.  when i ask whats in the bags the incompetent girl at the windows says dont worry your fries are there.  i dont care about the fries i just spent $50 i want to know that my order is there.  long story short got home order was messed up.  call to speak with manager he apologizes and ask me to come back after this experience i will never be back he says that he will mail my refund and here it is 2 weeks later and still no refund!  where is my refund coming from?????  save yourself the trouble and go to raising canes cause this place isnt good at all and the food disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"My web transaction was ready and was there when I came in. The cow mascots were in which is fantastic. Thank you Kevin for your excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!!  Blows away the competition!  I love that they are closed on Sunday!  Brings back the feeling of family values!!"}
{"text":"Love this chick fil a. The management there is phenomenal and if there are any hiccups they immediately address, but 99.9% of the time I go there there are no problems ever, which is crazy for fast food. The restaurant is always so clean and I love all the events they put on. This branch truly gives back to the community. My kids love going there for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!!  AND SO DO US PARENTS!!! Seriously love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food very friendly staff and my kiddos love the play area!  It is clean and their food is fresh every time I've gotten it.  They also have the best tasting diet lemonade I've had at a Chick Fil A...I am not sure what they do to make it any different but it's delicious.  I always enjoy stopping here as I don't eat fast food very often at all."}
{"text":"Having the ability to order through the new mobile app is definitely not only a game changer but a life changer. Ordering is a breeze and you're able to customize your order any way you want. If you want a Chick-fil-A sandwich with no pickles but bacon and cheese instead go for it, the app is your oyster. One of the best features of the app is curbside pickup. I can order my food when i'm still in a nearby store or leaving work and have it ready to be delivered to my car or pickup in store when I get there. No more waiting in long lines in store or through the drive-thru. Does it get much better than that?

It also goes without saying the their customer service at this location is hands down one of the best experiences out there today. Customer service is always consistently great and everyone is beyond friendly.  I can't give them enough compliments on that alone."}
{"text":"For as much traffic as this new Chick-fil-A gets , their service is incredible. I can't believe how fast I get my food even due to the serious amount of people that always seem to be in the drive thru. The customer service is wonderful and everyone always has a smile on their face. They've never gotten my order wrong and they always seem to be rushing to give the best service possible. But not rushing so fast that the customer service Lacks. Good job guys! Keep it up."}
{"text":"This is one of the busiest Chick-fil-A because it is on Independence Blvd. The staff if friendly and your meal is served quickly. Have used both the drive through and dine in at the restaurant. 

Always order the Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich, Waffle Fries- they are so addicting and unsweetened ice tea. It's like a weekly treat."}
{"text":"Well it's been like 2 months and a half that we haven't gone to this chick fil A on Eastern and St. Rose because after my review apparently the boss told all the employers who we were because when I did a yelp on them we ended going there the following Friday and boy did we get dagger eyes on us and we felt very very uncomfortable because you never know what they can do to your food so we just stop going there all together and now we go to the one on Sahara and the 15 we get so much better service there and they don't close there sections early we have gone there when they are about to close and they clean but around you not closing entire sections like the Eastern place way much better environment and there employers are very nice and happy and very very very friendly at least I can eat without people looking at me and talking behind my back not knowing what they are saying about you but giving you them dagger eyes at you just saying even if we have to travel out of our way from Henderson to Sahara to get better Services we will do it anytime."}
{"text":"Are the staff here robots?  They are always over the top friendly!  I came here to do some work on my laptop and eat and I had my drink (killer sweet tea) refillled 5 times!  I dont even have this type of service at some sit-down restaurants!

The food?  It's Chick Fil A."}
{"text":"I am hoping the owner is watching these because this is a great location and set of owners but they have the rudest employees. There is an older lady (grandma age) that is amazing and a young guy ( looks super young) that are always amazing but I went thru the drive thru and the girl was rude and confused. The women that is a day shift manager doubted me when I told her a sandwich was missing and took my bag and unpacked it piece by piece. I was shocked by her doubtful attitude. As soon as they get it together I will adjust this review but please get it together"}
{"text":"They have placed locks on the restroom doors.  This is not good around kids.  

Both have the same code and other customers share it anyway so what's the point?"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Chick-fil-A in our downtown neighborhood now!  We have stopped in a few times and it is always a consistently great experience - nice staff, clean dining room/patio and delicious food!  I love the original chicken sandwich and won't turn away the waffle cut fries - so good."}
{"text":"Good food and the nicest staff!!! My 4 year old's favorite restaurant lol! :)"}
{"text":"We waited in that long line, then the car in front of us we had to wait for with our food in hand. 
Opened our spicy chicken Sandwhich for my 16 year old- everything in I with extra pickles and there are 2 pickles with chicken and nothing else!
NOT HAPPY with this experince AT ALL!
All those people to get the line flowing working for you and this is what I come home to."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Abigail at the cashier was so rude and throw my sauce at me no your welcome or thank you. They couldn't even find my table and walked right passed me! Never again!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly & food always seems freshly prepared. Only downside is that it can be quite expensive for fast food."}
{"text":"What a great place for families!  The entire staff is so nice and extremely helpful.  The food is also hot and fresh.  I don't think we have ever had a bad meal there.  They also do a great job with their family nights on Monday.

The only negative is that the cow does not show up often."}
{"text":"The 5 star is solely for the spicy chicken deluxe sandwich with pepperjack cheese. If i had written this review after eating their grilled chicken sandwich i would have taken one star off not because its not good but because its not as good as the former. Its always busy around luch time. The service is efficient."}
{"text":"They have some great chicken. Its always fresh and the staff are nice. The best is the traditional number 1. It's a classic that you can't get tired of. They have a long wait around the peek times, but its okay because your getting good food. I like this place and recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chick-Fil-A's because I can always get a seat. Great staff, great food, and my favorite is the Diet Lemonade. It's fabulous. Or at least terrific, which is pretty close to fabulous."}
{"text":"They whack for having their employees outside taking orders in 110 degree weather. With online ordering and other technology there is no reason you should have people in those conditions. One employee has already had a heat stroke and it's not even July yet! Will never support a company that would do that to their people. It's not that serious for a chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"This was on my boyfriend's top 3 fast food places.  I saw they had 1 in AZ and I knew we had to come.  I was impressed because it's different from your typical burger & fries type of joint.  They have a variety of about 5 milkshakes which were thick & creamy.  I opted for the classic chicken sandwich which was really good - bun, fried chx fillet, and pickles.  They also serve breakfast burritos, and chx biscuits.   
The place was really clean and not grungy or run down.  I wish they had locations in the bay area."}
{"text":"The chicken taste great. Unfortunately the fingers that I got had hair. The second set they replaced it with was just heading but finally by the third try they got it right. They were friendly and helpful. Yes I'll visit again."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week for my daughters food. She absolutely loves the grilled chicken, applesauce and chocolate milk along with the awesome toy. Everyone is so nice and courteous. The place is always clean and there service is impeccable. When sitting in the dining room they will refill your drinks or take your trash when you are done with it. Employees that really care."}
{"text":"This location is great. The young staff if very professional and friendly. 
One day they were out of lemonade (it was 10 minutes to close) and they gave us a card to come back for a free sandwich or nugget, thought that was super cool! 
Service is always quick and our food is always perfect. Thanks!"}
{"text":"After eating at this Chick-Fil-A I have a hard time going to any other location.

This location gives customer service and quality of food a new meaning. Have never had a bad experience at Rraintree and 101 Chick-Fil-A. Can't say the same about the other locations.

Don't forget the Chick-Fil-A sauce!!"}
{"text":"There are much better locations then this one... Have been here a handful of times this year and never once had a great experience. Usually because of the customer service.

Went through the drive thru a couple of days ago and had to wait nearly 25 minutes (8pm at night) to get to the window.. They also forgot to put pickles on both of my deluxe sandwiches!! Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken meals - the sandwich, the strips, and the Asian chicken salad with Avocado ranch dressing were all fresh and very tasty. The location is clean, and the service is incredibly courteous and fast. Fresh flowers on the tables and in the bathroom, as well. Far exceeds my expectations of a fast food restaurant; I wish we had one in NY!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Chick-fil-A's and this was hands down the worse one I've ever been to. The staff at the line was annoyed and rolling her eyes while taking our order. When we got to the cashier she was also giving attitude. Fix your employees, you're known for your great customer service!"}
{"text":"It's so awesome that the airport now has my favorite fast food! Before leaving for Vegas, we stopped here and devoured some nuggets and fries. It was quite busy here on a Wednesday evening, but the service was pretty fast. Food was great! Will def return again when we are traveling and need a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, clean restaurant and one of the only fast food places with a playground. My cousin loves coming here- she has a blast on the playground and we really love their food, too. The fries are wonderful and I love their nuggets. Their breakfast minis are delicious, too. Try the sriracha sauce- you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Glad my favorite fast food place has moved to Vegas as a Cali native canes just was not cutting it. Everyone is so nice and has great customer service I got my food really fast! There will be long lines but that's kind of what you expect for Chick Fil A. Love the difference amounts of sauces you can get and the hospitality."}
{"text":"What a wonderful franchise!  They do it all well:  service, employee attitude, cleanliness, food quality, amenities and efficiency.

This is a southern thing and it is so good.  All chicken stuff, sit in or drive through.  The drive through is almost always loaded.  Two lanes and waiters walking down the waiting line of cars taking orders and calling them in.  Very efficient and quick.

When you walk in the employees are uniformed and clean.  Managers have on ties or a different shirt and they are on the line watching and helping.  You order and can just take a seat, which is very helpful to a mom and children coming for a meal.  Your order will be delivered to your table.

Employees circulate the dining area asking if you would like a drink refill or anything else and they actually take your beverage to the counter, have it filled and return it to you.  Gee!

The play area, as JB elaborated in his lengthy review, is super.  A glass wall allows parents to watch the play area and basically adults are not permitted entry, but sometimes one needs to capture an happy child in order to leave the restaurant and that is OK.

They recently added some wonderful doughy, yeasty biscuits each containing a pure white meat fried nugget of chicken.  Man o Man, three of those little darlings with a cup of decent coffee is a fine way to activate your drowsing body for the day.

Southern hospitality is practiced and is sincere.  This franchise wants you as a continuing customer and it shows.

And they are closed on Sundays, even at airport and mall locations.  Kudos to Chick-fil-A for standing up for something in our ever manic society."}
{"text":"I usually love chic fil a when I'm on the run and in need of something quick and tasty. However, the last two times I've ordered a cookie with my meal and it's been overcooked and way too crunchy.. not sure what's going on. I returned one the first time thinking it was a fluke but the replacement was the same. We'll keep coming back for the nuggets and fries, plus the great customer service, but I am bummed about not getting dessert."}
{"text":"Welcome to the sloweeeeest place in the world. Drive thru or dine in. Busy or not. They are just slow. They really take out the fast away from \"fast food\". And thats only working 6 days a week. Imagine if they had to work sundays.  :)"}
{"text":"Where do I even start, customer service is AMAZING!!! I've been coming to get lunch for my staff for about a year plus and I have zero complaints, everyone's always up beat and very friendly and food wise everything is always very fresh and delicious (wish I knew everyone's name to mention them on this review) they simply rock!!!"}
{"text":"I have been obsessed with Chick-fil-A for years, ever since a trip to Des Moines in 2010. I was so sad that the only one in Wisconsin was in Racine, so I was elated when they announced they were opening one in Madison. Ever since their grand opening a few years ago, I have added this to my lunch rotation, and frequented here often during my pregnancy. I love the spicy deluxe chicken sandwich, and when their waffle fries are fresh out of the oven? Oh man, prepare yourself- you will inhale them. I'm also a big fan of the chicken nuggets, which pair perfectly with the honey mustard. The employees are always friendly and helpful. If only all fast food restaurants could be like Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time since the opening (I'd put it off because I thought it was always going to be packed.) But there was no line, and the chicken sandwich was brought out even before I finished ordering! Now that's cool. (And the chicken was delicious .)"}
{"text":"So I decided to come here so I could get my mother in law a strawberry milkshake.  She has just been admitted to a nursing home nearby. But the machine is broke.  Which means I pulled into this crazy parking lot at lunchtime for nothing and I will be going to Panera instead.  Chick Fil A why you slipping to Mcdonalds standards?"}
{"text":"I do love this place. I'd like to put a special shout out to a cool chick who works there. Very personable and seemed to really care about her customers. Her name is Amanda, red hair, in case there's 2 that work there. She will go far in life, I can tell. Great attitude."}
{"text":"Went last night and all the employees were so friendly! My dog and I went drive they and of course they fell in love with her (duh), but what I thought was so cool was they offered to give her a dog treat!!! I had no idea they would even have that?!?! It wasn't a chicken thing or anything, but an actual box of some kind of hard crunchy dog treats. I thought that was so cool and so sweet for them to offer it to her. So on top of already good food and good values and service, they treated my dog with good customer service. My dog is my life so I really liked that!"}
{"text":"Having breakfast for myself. Love the chicken mini's! And most of all this is the second time I come in and the employee remembered exactly what I was going to order and what condiments I wanted! Now that's a great employee!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food way too expensive for what you get. Food taste good but for the price you're better off going somewhere else. Always crowded too and way too much hype. Haven't tried their breakfast yet though my fiancé says it's better."}
{"text":"As with every visit here, we leave with a good meal and feeling so positive. The staff really goes out of its way to treat you with kindness and respect! This is the better side of fast food! My congratulations to this company for promoting manners, good food and good prices!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Well once again this location messed up my order! This has to be the worst Chick-fil-A! I've given this location numerous chances, but tonight's order was the last. Ordered a Cobb salad quess what I get home and there's no chicken! Seriously your known for chicken how do you not see it's missing from the salad? I called and spoke to a supervisor she said oh I'm sorry! We have new people. We'll train and supervise them!  This is a poorly run location will avoid it , will drive to the one on Chandler Blvd."}
{"text":"Always a good visit when I come here! Great staff and service! Go for the family nights on Tuesdays 5:00PM- 7:00PM!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken. Friendly and courteous staff. Clean environment.  Not the best intersection during meal times but will deal with the traffic to have their chicken and customer service!"}
{"text":"This location is on my way to work! 

Sometimes, it is quicker to go inside than sit in the drive thru. So true for the morning rush! 

My favorite breakfast is the bagel with the famous sauce. I just wish the bagel wouldn't fall apart halfway through eating it! 

I love the seasonal peach milkshake. It's so good and so worth the splurge. 

I just wish this location was open on Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"Not to sound like a fat ass but this is like the forth time I've gotten a medium fry and they shorted me. I mean,  their food is not cheap.  I want my money's worth. If I wanted to be disappointed everytime I opened my bag I would go to McDonald's..."}
{"text":"Yesss first review I came here after driving past here earlier no wait and it was great I got the nuggets and fries :) the waffle fries are AMAZING yummy!!!! Don't forget your honey mustard dipping sauce 

There was no wait when I went thank gosh in and out super fast 

Everything tasted the same lots of metro thought they were stuffing there faces as well so don't even pay them attention they were enjoying the food 

I will
Be back so happy they are here and closer to me"}
{"text":"First time trying out their breakfast menu! it was delicious and plus there was no lines!!!! Service was great! All staff were very friendly and the place is very clean! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I always expect a positive experience at any Chick-fil-A, but this one is exceptionally well ran! I usually visit this restaurant at least once a week, and I always receive incredible service. 

Whether you dine in or use the drive thru, you're probably going to have a bit of a wait, this store gets a ton of traffic. Don't fret, they are always well staffed to handle the traffic. Facilities from the dining room to the restrooms are always clean and tables are wiped down as soon as it's vacant.

Not much needed to say about the food except that it is always what I expect from Chick-fil-A; it's either right or not!

The service at a Chick-fil-A varies in a weird way. You're always going to get a friendly smile wherever you go but some locations go really over the top and it comes off as too patronizing. The staff here were trained right and their customer service is very genuine.

Really glad this spot is right in my backyard. Hats off to management for running a tight ship!"}
{"text":"Love chic fil a. Who would complain? Good chicken. Awesome lemonade. The sauce uughhh- HEAVEN What more can you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"Sienna tripped outside and hurt her knee ! It was bleeding the staff made her a bag of ice and brought her a bandaid. I know this place is fast food but they are always attentive to the needs of the guests. They have multiple healthy options for your kids as well as adults. They also offered to fill up our drinks and brought mints and towel wipes to the table."}
{"text":"This drive thru and staff are professional, nice and courteous.  With smiles on their faces we received our order correctly and so quick.  Down to the correct number of honey mustards! Love this Chick fil a because of the people who run it !"}
{"text":"I can't sing enough praises about this location. I work out of Miami for a pretty large insurance company, and I'm flown into Ohio ever so often for training. The service at this Chik-Fil-A is so prestigious, it's literally a race from the training facility to the restaurant every day during lunch for most of the employees I work with. 

From the Employee of the Month at the register (Bryan), to the Employee of the Year (Barb) who walks around filling drinks and clearing trays, this place has better service than some of the higher end restaurants I've been to. And this latest visit was nothing short of fantastic. 

Seriously, how can this be a fast food place? #EatMorChikin"}
{"text":"What has happened to this Chick-Fil-A?  Used to be friendly, service great, etc.  Now I feel unwelcome, service is not great, no one smiles and
the play area is out of control.  Not even a \"My Pleasure\" at the end."}
{"text":"Surprisingly fast service both inside and out.   
Food was very warm, not terribly hot.  Flavors/taste were as expected.  No one waited for their food, though.   There was a line of cars stretched around the store and they were moving at a rapid clip. 

I only give 5 stars if a store goes well above and beyond so don't take my 4 stars as a negative score."}
{"text":"I honestly think that three stars for a fast food restaurant is a good thing.  I mean, they all have the defined way of doing things within the corporate structure, right?  So that means it is all about execution.
The uptown Chik-Fil-A (I think I occassionally have a tinge of dyslexia, beceause I originally thought it was Chik-A-Fil and I just did NOT understand why anyone would call a restaurant that), is one of the best run ones that I have come across.
Its sort of personal (and MAYBE a tinge creepy?) when they ask for your name to match with your order.  Bonus creepy points for when they just ready it off your debit card and say, \"here is your sandwich, Jared.\"  
Whoa.  Fast food from a telepath... trippy.
I do not understand the pickle on a chicken sandwich.  But their chicken filet is ten times better than anything else that you will get in under two minutes in a paper bag.  I usually opt for the wheat bun without the pickle or just nugget-like meals.  Both are satisfiying with the waffle fries.
I DID recently try the chicken salad sandwich that they have on their meal menu.  Gotta say that I am NOT a fan.  When you take a bite of a chicken salad sandwich, your first thoughts should not be \"hot dog?\"
That is not, \"HOT DOG, that is a good chicken salad sandwich!\"  That is, \"why in the hell does this chicken salad taste like diced hot dogs?!\"
But on the whole, I am a fan of the Chik-A-Fil.  And with this location and my use of it for work lunches, I do not have to worry about the fact that it will not be open on Sundays when my hangover craving settles in..."}
{"text":"What a dirty place.  All the tables were dirty,  the kids play area was dirty and floors were as well.  They need to spend on a person cleaning up.  We ordered and had to eat here but yuck!  We wrapped our food and ate in the car.  We could see inside the restaurant for about 15 minutes while eating in the car and during that time not one person went around cleaning tables."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for five years since moving from Tennessee. Love it more and more. Those peach shakes"}
{"text":"I do love this establishment and how kind employees are....however the play area has stunk worse than a HS locker room the past 2 visits. To the point it is nauseating.  I hope it is a fluke. When in Arizona we come here at least weekly if not 2/3 a week. I would hate to have to avoid it."}
{"text":"Gross bathroom, and dirty play area. I go to many locations, never seen one that makes McDonald's seem clean. Until now. Play area had chunks missing in floor.  Changing station looked to be on its last leg.  Over disgusting.  
Had to ask for sauces, never at any other location. Just seemed odd, kept behind counter. .unlike other locations.  Sauce theft an issue here? I won't return to this location ever."}
{"text":"Great place for families. Toddler play area :) sadly a lot of older kids are in there  plowing past the toddlers & employees ignore it. Otherwise good prices & clean place."}
{"text":"Great food great service and great lemonade. I am a frequent flyer Pittsburgh international airport and I was so excited to see the addition of chick Fila. Food was good fresh and fast. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"First time for Chick fil A for me, and I wish they were where I live, food was great, service was friendly and the hostess had the best southern accent, which I understand is common for the area, but hers just made it a little more home-style, and friendly! I would eat there again!"}
{"text":"I was going to try this place on the opening day. I drove past with my wife and we said NO WAY. The lines for the drive thru looked super long and the interior of the restaurant looked packed to the gills. 

Well tonight I was at home myself and figured I'd chance it so I could get some of this southern goodness. It was about 8pm and the drive thru was still full. I wasn't in the mood to eat inside so I opted for the drive thru. 

Chick-fil-a knew this was going to be a big deal. They had multiple staff coordinating cards in the drive thru. They offered menus and as soon as you reached a point further up you placed your order. Even further up the drive thru you would make your payment. This isn't permanent, it's just a way for them to get the cars moving quickly and efficiently.

Every single person I spoke with tonight was SUPER friendly and some even had a sweet southern accent. 

The food was good, I ordered the original chicken sandwich and had the waffle fries. I made my meal a large and it was only $6.85. This is very reasonable for the very tasty sandwich and fries that I received. 

Welcome to Madison Chick-fil-a, you'll be a hit!"}
{"text":"Very friendly as always, tried the new Lemonade Milkshake...Freaking Amazing!!! Even better since they just recently remodeled the place! I love y'all!"}
{"text":"If you are going to eat fast food them this is the place to go...good chicken sandwiches, yummy shakes and great kids meals."}
{"text":"Came here with my best friend with high expectations, hoping to have a great experience and meal. Was highly dissatisfied. The female worker at the drive through that processes payment sent us to the window so that a \"manager\" could assist us and we did not get to speak to management or at least not to someone who acted as if they were a manager. We talked to a young, Caucasian, blonde kid with glasses and he was rude. Poor customer service. Also, I ordered a frosted coffee and it was gross. It was very watery. I asked if I could change it   and while waiting for his response he very rudely stated \"I can't reach into your car\"  
They did let me replace it with a chocolate shake. Our food was okay, didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"The most friendly & helpful staff I've ever experienced at a chick-fil-a. I'm pretty sure I've been to 100 locations. Lol."}
{"text":"Always delicious, quick, and kind service. They maintain the chick-fil-A image of having nice, respectful employees. Awesome and refreshing. Food is so much better than any other fast food. Always actually hot, never greasy. Waffle fries are always yummy and when peach milkshake season comes around, stock up."}
{"text":"Pathetic breakfast chicken bagel sandwich. The chicken gets smaller and smaller everytime I go. About half the bagel is empty. And today it was put together very sloppy. Really... Chick-fil-A? I don't think the quality that you are supposedly known for is there. I am not going to be going there again."}
{"text":"Chic Fil A is flat-out superior fast food!
We had 10 minutes to get to an appointment 2 blocks away. That was enough time to order breakfast, pay for and get breakfast, drive to appointment while noshing yummy biscuits and chicken bites.
I wish they served this till noon. 
It's craveable."}
{"text":"Not sure if the cashier didn't hear us but my boyfriend had to say he wanted Coca Cola about three times. 

As for the service, it was fast but the cashier wasn't very happy like other cashiers at the camelback location. Our food was prepared well. However, my fries were a little salty."}
{"text":"This Chick-Fil-A is fantastic. The staff is extremely friendly, polite and courteous with \"yes sir, thank you sir\",  and a \"thanks for dining with us\" as you leave. The service is great too. The facility is spotless clean and restrooms impeccable. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Don't even bother stopping by for breakfast. They completely drop the ball on food quality. Most items are inedible and probably sitting on the line from the moment they open. Since the construction of bell Rd I'm sure has dropped their business. Either way it's not okay."}
{"text":"Been waiting for this to open for SOO long now!! Came here the third day they open in the morning and there was already and a line and  have to guide the  and block some entrances.

Ok the food was just mediocre.  I ordered 2 spicy  chicken sandwich (good 3/5) noting WOW about it.

The chicken nuggets were made from white meat (3/5) just ok.  I like Mac Donald's nugget more..hehe!! My 9 yr. old agreed and he was so looking forward to coming here. 

The cris cut  is just a OK!  BUT   their sauces, very good(Polynesian one). 

Extra star  cuz they have disposable place mat for babies  and good service!"}
{"text":"Consistent top notch service. In the three years I have worked near here, I have not had bad service even one single time. This is a great place to eat, and a breath of fresh air when compared to the service at most fast food joints."}
{"text":"I have never been greeted by so many employees at a fast food place in my life. That was nice, but what got me was the Missing Man Table... I thought that was incredibly touching. My family and I had just come from the Department of Veterans Affairs getting our new retired ID's. My husband served for 20 years, and we just moved from San Diego- a huge Military area. Yet it took us coming to Wisconsin to see this. I love that our service members are acknowledged. 
The service was great and it was very clean. I would absolutely come back here again!"}
{"text":"The Chick-fil-A line is always running 20 people deep, but don't let that disappoint you. The line and service here is super fast!! The food is always served hot and the staff is friendly. I always get the spicy chicken sandwich with Chick-fil-A sauce on the side to dip my fries in. It tastes like a slightly spicy honey mustard. So good! 

You've probably seen in other reviews, but this location doesn't carry all of the menu items at Chick-fil-A including the Asian salad or the sunflower bagel biscuit sandwich. Darn. They also don't have chicken tortilla soup. I'm not sure why they don't serve it, but it's delicious if you ever get the chance to try it!"}
{"text":"The food at Greg's location is always fresh and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Will definetly eat there again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch this week and even though it is busy the staff was friendly, they had a plan for smooth transactions, it was clean. It was a good experience and I went on my lunch break and didn't have any issues with time."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A already had great customer service, now for it to be in CMC its just x's 5!!! I don't know if they always did this but we placed a order, went to sit down waiting to be called and he came over to personally deliver it and told us to enjoy. If that's not excellent customer service than I don't know what is!!!"}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place another try. 
Went through the drive-thru, placed my order and thought everything was going to be better than the last time. Wrong. 
I placed an order for a grilled chicken sandwich, no cheese. Asked to have them repeat the sandwich to me to make sure they got it right. Grilled chicken sandwich no cheese. Perfect
Drive up, hand over my card, get me bag and soda and I'm off and on my way. Ate the fries, drank some soda, opened the box to a crispy chicken 2 slices of cheese. 
Clearly requirement #1 for a job at this place is to be dumb as humanly possible or 2 points of IQ higher than dirt, whichever comes first. 
The plus side, for my stuff fast and hot, but still a total waste of space on this planet. 
Go to Jason's Deli on the backside of the mall, way better sandwiches."}
{"text":"My 4yr old child was assaulted in the play area by another child and the mother watched it happen. When I confronted the irresponsible mother she proceeded to call my child and me retarded. IN FRONT OF MY CHILD and all the children and adults within hearing range of the the play area. With Chick-fil-a's reputation of being a Christian based Company I am truly disgusted to know your company and management allowed this bullying, verbally abuse, dissolute women to remain in your restaurant.  When I spoke with management (Gabriel at the location 905 N. Dobson Rd, Mesa AZ 85201)  He told me to lower my voice \"so other customers wouldn't hear\" (How unbelievably rude and insensitive after my child was physically and verbally assaulted) said there is nothing he can do. As a Christian and mother I am beyond shocked and appalled. The fact that your Restaurant allows a degenerate adult bully who calls a child retarded, permits their child to hit is allowed stay in your restaurant without being asked to leave is inconceivable.
I WAS a huge supporter of your restaurants. After this unbelievably HORRIBLE experience I can honestly say I highly doubt I will ever spend another dime at any of your locations."}
{"text":"This is a really good Chick-Fil-A.

The employees are friendly, and the food is cooked to standard.  I've found they're quick about getting you through the drive-thru, and I've never had a negative experience at this location when it comes to food or service.

Only complaint is the parking lot, and drive thru lanes.  They're a little tough to navigate.  The restaurant is adjacent to the Rockne's and it's on a tight track of land."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this Chick-Fil-A location.  It was one of the first free standing unit's in the Cleveland area and it has not disappointed.

The service is consistently good.  The food for the most part is always on.  Only minor issues I've had is with the Coca-Cola sometimes not tasting 100% on par, but other than that this place is fantastic.

They have great community events too...especially for families with children.

Thankfully they recently opened up their back drive to allow access to the plaza with Target, so it's even easier to sneak in/out of."}
{"text":"Great place to bring kids for a quick lunch!  They have a play area suitable for 4 and under.  It's always busy but food always comes out quick and hot! Best fast food for toddlers with fruit for a side and they also have Mac n cheese now!"}
{"text":"Some days you just crave chickfila then realize it's a Sunday and you suddenly get depressed. Luckily, I came here on a Saturday. The drive thru line was literally to the street so I decided to walk in and order. The line inside was about 10 people deep, but the line went super fast. I was in and out within 10 minutes. This location is ALWAYS busy, but they are always very quick and be food is made fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich and great service. Would recommend to anyone. The siracha sauce is great!"}
{"text":"Always great service at any chic-fil-a but I didn't know this location has a private room for parties or meetings. It's located right by the play area so it can get a little loud with kids banging on the glass and screaming. Not sure of the room cost but it was  a good location for our kids basketball season ending party."}
{"text":"Came in at 7pm on a Saturday. Clearly the crew was ready to close up because the restroom and dining room area was trashed. Usually, chick-Fil-a are some of the cleanest restaurants I visit. Disappointing. Plus the crew seemed to be screwing around in the kitchen."}
{"text":"An absolute HUGE thank you to the Chick-Fil-A team in Surprise for saving the day!! They were able to put together a last minute catering ordering within in 30 minutes and were so kind and accommodating. Chris and Brooke were outstanding and so helpful in a very stressful situation."}
{"text":"The staff was on point this morning. First time trying their breakfast. Got a grilled chicken egg white sandwich and hash browns.. delicious. Not too greasy. I was offered a water cup by the boy taking orders outside the drive thru and the young lady in the window was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I am a huge Chick-Fil-A fan. I've never really had any problems with them for years. I went to this one this morning and we picked up food for 3. They read out the order when they gave it to me but somehow messed up our drinks and gave me a Frozen Coffee that was completely melted and warm. We noticed by the time we got in the car but were running late to an appointment so had no time to go back"}
{"text":"Was stoked that Henderson was opening a Chick fil A, moved from California we had this many times. But what a disappointment, the prices are expensive plus is it me but has the chick sandwich shrunk?"}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good here however this is the third time I have gotten the chicken nuggets and you guys have forgotten my sauce. Wtf do I w no sauce n chicken nuggets?!? I'm so tired from a long day n this just blows."}
{"text":"It feels wierd to write review for a fast place but when you get good service it should be acknowledged. 

I come here occasionally for dinner when I work late and don't feel lile cooking. The food is good, for fast food. It s always fast amd hot with friendly service. I came here for breakfast for the first time this morning. I enjoyed the breakfast, I got the chicken biscut and hashbrowns. The biscut was flavorful better than any other fast food place.

Why am I giving a fast food resturant 5 stars? Well the polite friendly service makes it go from 4 to a 5. They always say my pleasure. They also will give you extra condiments with out charging extra like most other fast food resturants. I will always come here if I am craving fast food."}
{"text":"I am a huge Chick-Fil-A fan and and rarely find any significant fault with any; however, this Charlotte, NC Arboretum location is the best, hands down, that I have ever visted. Of course, their renowned customer service is rarely less than superb at any location, and this place is no exception.

The menu of all Chick- Fil-As had been enhanced with healthy choices such as kale salad replacing such long time evil favorites such as their delicious yet sinful cole slaw. Otherwise, it is the best fast food around to go along with the uncommonly excellent service.

My only complaint is the lack of recyclables used in the packaging. Although far from fanatical, it still still disturbs me to see how much waste (particularly Styrofoam) that gets chunked in the trash following every meal. Even in this area, they are progressing however.

In spite of that, as far as a fast good category, I give this location gets five stars."}

Our family of four dined here after 8 PM was greeted by our very pleasant cashier and we especially enjoyed the new industrio-chic design."}
{"text":"As much as I knock the CLE airport for everything they do wrong, this CFA location was really good.

The staff were friendly, the food was fast and good (for Chick-Fil-A) and there was plenty of seating in the newer airport food court.  The floor to ceiling windows give a great view of the air field."}
{"text":"I'm a huge mark out to the Chick-Fil-A chain, but this location is admittedly hit and miss.

Candidly, I only go through drive thru service at this location.

The last time I went to the drive thru there was some nut job staring at the menu for 5 minutes.  Then I pull up to the point of sale drive thru system for the order, and the CFA employee starts singing to me through the speaker.   That was it, I was done...I drove thru without ever placing an order.

This is a place of business, not a show choir."}
{"text":"Your manager Daphne is so very rude.  she is loud and I went to your location today. I placed a mobile order and the young gentleman when I got to the register was very nice and he got my order for me. This Daphne lady said did you place a mobile order. I said yes, she rudely said, mobile orders are picked up here. She never spoke to me that's one mistake. The way she said it to me was very loud and rude. maybe she thinks she can talk to her own kind like that. If I wasn't a professional woman. I would have definitely got her in place real quick.  I didn't move from the register because no one was behind me. she then proceeded to say to me. are you placing another order.  I said no I'm not. I said I will move over here to make you feel better and she laughed. however no one was behind me in the line. Then one of your employees came in to clock in. this lady said to him in front of customers.  why are you late? He proceeded to explain why.  she said you need to make sure you call when being late. which I agree. however not infront of customers. I use to be in management  so she should have pulled him aside and explain that to him instead of being UNPROFESSIONAL and doing it in front of customers. I think that was embarrassing and very unprofessional. I think Daphne needs more training. Just because she is loud and probably scare her employees because of her loud demeanor that is very uncalled for.  I do reviews often. I could not wait to place this review."}
{"text":"This location is the most consistently good Chick-fil-a in the valley. They always make my food fresh, the portion sizes are always much larger than the Chick-fil-a outside of metrocenter, the tea is always fresh and the employees are very friendly, polite, and professional. This location is everything you want from a fast food place and more."}
{"text":"This was the first ever chick-fil-a I've ever been to. I live in Hawaii and there is no chick-fil-a there so I was excited to try it out. I had the classic chicken sandwich which was good. I'm not a fan of their fries but that's alright. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, great first ever chick-fil-a experience. 4 shakas"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A, but TAKE OUT AT THIS LOCATION IS A DISASTER!  I have been going there almost daily for months. They frequently screw up my order and by time I get home and realize they got it wrong it's impractical to go back to get it corrected. So, I'm stuck with an order that is different than what I paid for. I have called them back many time and they'll mail me coupons for free stuff. But I don't want free stuff, I just want my order to be correct.

After innumerable mistakes I started asking them to completely verify the order by unpacking the bags and repacking them verifying each item. Still, they've managed to screw it up 3 times since then. For example, ordered a 6 piece nuggets and they gave me 4 piece, etc.

Finally, I asked for the mgr at the take out window today, told him about it and said that it isn't my job to figure out the process steps for his employees to get my order right and if he can't sort it out I'm gonna just stop coming. He gave me my order for free, but again, I don't want free stuff, I just want my orders to be correct.

 I've NEVER experienced so many errors from a fast food place in my long life!

I give 2 stars rather than one only because the food is good, and I've only had 1 problem while dining in. But the take out is a disaster."}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A has pretty bad service. I came here with 2 children and a baby and I ordered food for all of us. The person taking our order was pretty rude and they forgot to bring out one of our fries. I went up to ask for the other fry and the cashier asked me to get out my receipt even though I literally just ordered and she saw me struggling with three kids. The salad we got looked like it was made with old lettuce, as most of it was brown. They brought out our food super fast, but I'm guessing that they just had chicken sitting around waiting to be used because the chicken was extremely cold. I expect more from Chick-fil-A. I used to work at Chick-fil-A and I know how important customer service and third mile service is to this corporation, but this Chick-fil-A clearly does not follow this"}
{"text":"I camped out and did the whole 24 hours first 100. It wasn't what I expected it to be. Had so much fun with meeting new people and Chik-fil-a hostess were awesome! They had games and prices. They also gave us free breakfast, lunch and dinner.

I always go for the spicy chicken sandwich. Just the regular not deluxe don't need all the other stuff. With the sauces I like to combine the buffalo sauce and Polynesian on my sandwich and chik-fil-a sauce with the waffle fries."}
{"text":"The chicken is delish as always and it taste so fresh. Try different combos of sauces with the chicken sandwich. I like the combo of Buffalo and Polynesian sauce. If you want to keep it simple ranch on the spicy chicken is good as well. The cookie is like a giant chips ahoy but better."}
{"text":"First time at this location. The drive thru lines were long we decided to park and go inside.  The great thing is that they take your order outside so inside you just pay.  The staff was cool and professional,  and very helpful. I noticed a worker inquiring about the meal with all the customers. Soon after paying I waited less than 5 minutes and my food was out.  This is truly a fast food restaurant! I usually get the nuggets but this time I got the spicy chicken sandwich...yummy! Next time I'll order online to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"I just love it, I can't help it. This is the best chicken place in town. I love their breakfast sandwich a biscuit with a chicken breast on it .. I don't know what it is, I don't know what makes their stuff so good. There is a chick-fil-a sauce but I don't usually get the sauce - it's the chicken. It's just so fresh, so juicy, so hot. I love it!"}
{"text":"Okay so Azure was quite a delight in the drive through. I joked with him about what the fuss was as there was probably 15 cars in front of me in the drive through. I ordered 1 sandwich and a drink, he upsold me on the criss-cut fries and omg am I glad he did, they were deslish. I had never had them before. He also suggested I get a Chick-fil-A sauce so I did and it was so great not only for a dipping sauce for the fries but to dip my combo 1 chicken sandwich into. What a great meal it was. And Azure deserves a raise."}
{"text":"I DO NOT GET THE HYPE!!!!!! We waited till  the dust settled, wanted to eat in house to get it at its best.  Both ordered a chicken sand, well, is was not busy and the sandwich was cold, not fidge cold, sitting around cold. The famous potatoes were oily and limp and cold.  I turned to some people near me and asked if this was their first time and they said no they loved it, I expressed my opinion and asked what they loved about it my food was cold and tasteless and they all replied \"oh the sauce\"  well heck look on line you can make the sauce at home and have a heck of a lot better sandwich.  even my two year old grandson will not eat the nuggets, I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Too busy but well managed. Ran out of soda aka pop ....Ummmm nah that's unacceptable. Offered lemonade but with no discount to make up for the loss of service. Pretty weak honestly I personally as a restaurateur would have gone to the store and bought bottled/canned soda to rectify the situation. Overall good chicken tho."}
{"text":"My fave fast food restaurant. Its yummy, quick and service is extremely friendly. 

Some items I enjoy... 

The chicken: 

Chicken Nuggets (w Chick Fil A sauce) 
Grilled Chicken Sandwich (ask for the honey roasted BBQ sauce to go w) 
Spicy Chicken Sandwich Deluxe w Pepper jack Cheese 

for breakfast: 

Chicken Minis! (yummy honey glazed mini biscuits w a chkn nugget in each) 
Spicy Chicken Biscuit (new item, already had it twice... it's good) 

*I like how it is an actual honking piece of chicken for their chicken sandwich and not a mushed up chicken patty w fillers. They pressure cook their chicken, I believe, and it's always moist and juicy. Their nuggets are chunks of chicken meat, also. Their are tons of sauce to choose from... (BBQ, Ranch, Buffalo, Honey Mustard, Polynesian, Chick Fil A, and maybe a few more). Their spicy chicken is seasoned nicely and actually has a good spicy flavor, but not overly spicy. 

The sides. 

Their waffle fries are bomb. Never overly salty. Side salads has lettuce, carrots, cheese, tomatoes and broccoli and come with croutons and sunflower seeds. 

Dessert: 

Thick flavorful milkshakes. Ice Dream (soft served vanilla ice cream), and Nut Brownies (can also get it a la mode w some Ice Dream on top). 

They have lots of tasty options here. Service is friendly and fast. If I'm running behind and need to pick up a quick lunch, I roll through the drive through (which is like once a week, hehe). 

So save the cows... \"Eat Mo' Chik N\""}
{"text":"The best customer service I've ever encountered at a fast food chain. When I walked in, the manager held the door open, welcomed me, and ASKED HOW MY DAY WAS. Whoa!! Every cashier was chipper and helpful, and staffers went from table-to-table to check if customers needed anything else, including topping off soda, clearing trays, and fetching more dipping sauces. I even saw the manager serving fountain drinks behind the counter to keep up with the pace of soda orders.

Coming from NYC where you're considered lucky if a fast food place gets your order right, I was thrilled by the quality and amount of care I received.

Oh yeah, the food was great too... Fresh and piping hot!"}
{"text":"Only deducting a star because they are closed on Sundays. You may disagree with me on this. My Dad certainly does. He thinks it shows character to not compromise your own beliefs to make money. I think it shows common sense to allow me to exchange my money for your chicken any time I damn well please. So we agree to disagree.

Chick Fil A is definitely up there with Chipotle and In & Out as a top tier \"Fast Food\" place. Their chicken is juicy and tender and delicious and they come with tons of pickles, which I love. My similarities to Snookie end there. They also give you a bunch of different sauce options, so when you get a really good sandwich, you feel like you can kind of take some of the credit because you chose the sauce. I am all about heaping undeserved praise on myself, so this really helps with that. Okay, my similarities to Snookie end THERE.

Their fountain drink machine has both Coke Zero AND Diet Dr Pepper as zero calorie options, which is fantastic. I wish all places would start offering more diet options in their fountain machine. I mean, seriously, who drinks real soda? Besides, maybe, during a hangover? I just cannot fathom consuming 240 empty calories just so my Coke has real corn syrup in it. Actually, all places just need to just get those touch screen coke machines, including this Chick Fil A, if they haven't (which I'm not sure because I've only used the drive through).

Finally, the employees are all SUPER nice. At first I thought it was a fluke, and I just happened to get a ridiculously pleasant drive through attendant, but they've all been like that so it must be part of their training or something. Or maybe my Dad is right, and they're just in a good mood because they have Sundays off."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken sandwich is really really good.  But I would have to say I do like canes a bit better.  Staff is really nice though."}
{"text":"Dirty tables at lunch time.  There was a woman handing out samples of something...I was not asked if I wanted one.  Maybe she could tell I was gay...and we all know how they feel about that!"}
{"text":"Rediscovering chick-fil-a. Love the chicken nuggets and chicken sandwiches.  this place is addicting.  I used to have this all the time back in college and now I remember why.  What a refreshing blast from the past."}
{"text":"Chick Fil A is one of my favorite fast food places. Their regular chicken sammiches are off the hook, their slaw is perfect with the right amount of creaminess, and their waffle fries are different but delicious. Plus their sauces are out of this world! I love the polynesian or chick fil a sauce to dip my fries in. Also terrific is their chargrilled chicken sammich which is also one of the healthiest fast food entrees around. Make sure you get the honey BBQ sauce to go with it. Whenever I need a healthy lunch, I always go here. I also love that you can get other sides besides the fries like fruit (the fruit cup has good fruits in it too like apple, strawberries, grapes, oranges), salads, etc. And how could I forget their oreo shake. Out of this world. This is the only place I get shakes from. 
About the only thing I have not cared for is their chicken salad sammich. It has egg in it which is a bit odd and just doesnt taste very fresh. Other than that, this place is great. 
I have never had any issues with service at any of the locations. The food is a bit overpriced but its better quality and tastes a lot fresher and lighter than other fast food chains.
I do want to add one more thing: I am pretty sure that someone that worked for KFC early on before they become big formed Chick Fil a because their chicken breading tastes almost the same and the slaw is almost identical. Coincidence? I think not!"}
{"text":"Same quality you would expect from chick fil A.  Every location taste the same.  I gave 2 stars for the lack of fries.....  i ordered a large fries and my frie container wasn't even full.  Like they rationing them.  

I was in the drive thru and didn't notice until i was back at work.  If i was dining in i would have said something."}
{"text":"Just had the worst bagel, chicken, egg breakfast sandwich at this location this morning. I haven't been here in over 3 months, needed a coffee and decided to purchase the sandwich, which has been good in the past. Bagel was cold and literally fell apart and crumbled on the first bite, the chicken was tiny at best, egg was unseasoned and had no taste....this was about 730 when it's very busy, but no excuse for a truly awful product. If I hadn't been on my way to work, I would have taken it back."}
{"text":"God I love Chick-fil-A! The food is consistently good and the wait staff are consistently friendly. I was so excited when Henderson opened one up I ate here for like two weeks straight. This Chick-fil-A is pretty consistent with th other ones I've gone too. They fixed my order when it was wrong and apologized for the inconvenience. Would recommend if this is your first Chick-fil-A experience!"}
{"text":"Rediscovering chick-fil-a. Love the chicken nuggets and chicken sandwiches.  this place is addicting, seriously what so they put in the chicken breeding! I used to have this all the time back in college and now I remember why.  What a refreshing blast from the past."}
{"text":"This is my first time This place is insanely busy and food taste is not even up to standard. I don't know why people lined up for this shit and I was waiting for 30 mins in drive through and didn't full fill my order that they missed 12 pieces of my kids chicken nuggets. So they just make my whole day bad an went to Wendy and bought cheaper price same nuggets I guess. Never go back. If you really need good chicken goto el pollo loco"}
{"text":"This location messed up my order, had me wait for 15 min for my meal when they said t would only take 5 minutes.. why lie? Just be honest. Also, when I got my order it was wrong, the cashier rung it up wrong. When I brought it back, the manager Janice tried to have me pay for the cheese lettuce and tomatoes when THEY messed up my order and didn't give me what I ordered.. where I come from, you mess up, you make it right. You don't tell the customer they need to pay for their mess. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"WOOO HOOO!!  We're from California and so excited that Chick-fil-A is here in Henderson!!  The food is awesome, they have healthy choices, and the staff is so professional and cheerful!  I know the restaurant is new, but it's very clean!  Can't wait to come back in"}
{"text":"Really great customer service every ones really friendly and Eddie provided outstanding service definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"It's very nice and clean. Mad house during lunch time so plan ahead. The frozen lemonade it delicious"}
{"text":"This is my first time ever at a Chick Fil A despite me being a die hard burger fan (Umami and 5 Guys ftw) but I do love me a chicken sandwich once in a while.

This was a great experience, I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which came with waffle fries. The chicken was cooked absolutely perfectly, moist tender juicy and the spice was just right. The chicken was very hot too which was great because it felt like it was just cooked and not premade like they do at McD and other fast foods, whether this is actually the case or they have great microwaves capable of preventing the drying process I have no idea but that was fantastic. I do think the burger overall could benefit from a sauce of some kind since it only comes w a lightly buttered bun and 2 pickles but maybe you're supposed to dress it as you see fit (ketchup/mayo on the stand). I was told there is also a CFA sauce but I havent tried it.

Waffle fries were decent but really need some serious seasoning. The cook was decent, they were light so if you like the harder sides for fries you will not be pleased.

I've read in the news that this place employees friendly people/trains them to be extra friendly. From my experience the staff are definitely more attentive and nicer than your avg ones at McD that's for sure. But hey I've only been here once so it might not be the best sample size."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Can't get enough. Check out my photo. They need a location in Summerlin.  I tried the spicy, but I'll come back for the original"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Chick fil A. I had the Chick fil A sandwich and the waffle fries. It was delicious. I was most impressed by the young man who waited on me. He was very polite as was the girl who brought me my order.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"They need more parking! And the drive thru line is always packed at lunch. Service is always good. #1 is the perfect amount of food. The kids love the chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"I realise I may be the last person on earth to ever eat at one of their restaurant.   For a fast food place, and I almost feel bad writing that, this is awesome stuff.   I'm glad I like chicken, but always wary that everything you never wanted to eat tastes like\"chicken\"top.   The menu isn't largest but at a little higher price McDonald's ot Wendy's better service is the reward. 

I had spicy chicken sandwich with waffle fries and sweet tea (real sweet tea!).  Breaded chicken looked a little over done but was spot on.   Excellent fries, next time I'll try cheese dip.   Their soup and salad combo was other meal.   The soup was like homemade, seriously.   No can of broth over chickie strips and a pair of carrots here!  This was nice mix of wide noodles, celery, onions, carrots, and oh yeah several pieces of chicken. 

Ok twilight zone part.   They bring food to you, they bring you refills on drinks and they take away your tray and garbage.   Strange but true.   Again I'm a first time visitor here"}
{"text":"I'm not much for fast food, but I do stop in here for breakfast on occasions when a chicken biscuit is calling my name (or whatever). Everyone that works here is so nice. While I'm sure they've been trained to be that way, it feels genuine each and every time. Breakfast starts at 6:30 - so I'm usually waiting for them to open the door so that I can get to work on time, and they always open on time. The food is always hot & fresh. Never a bad call for a last minute decision."}
{"text":"So this is not the first time I have asked for grilled nuggets, the order taker (drive thru) doesn't listen and rings in regular nuggets and then now I have to pull into the parking lot next for to wait for them to bring my order.  When I asked the girl who was taking payments to read my order back she coped an attitude and said \"your whole order?\" I said yes, can you confirm what I ordered please.  She rolled her eyes and ran back to her stand. She came back and said \"12 nuggets and large fry\" I said \"grilled nuggets, right?\" She said \"oh, you want grilled?\" I said \"yes, it's what I ordered\" she went and got a manger card to fix it. Told me the new total and I said \"I knew the other total was wrong, that's why I knew my order was wrong\" she told me \"well she said you didn't specify so she gave you Reg. Nuggets\" I corrected her and said \"I know I specifically ordered the grilled nuggets because you guys have messed up my orders before\" she rolled her eyes and I proceeded forward only to be told that I had to pull out of line and flip a U-turn to the parking lot next door.  Where I waited for about 3 min.   Overall the food is good but the service sucks!!"}
{"text":"I like this location better than the one near my house because of less errors. The food is consistently prepared and  I appreciate it. I do have one problem to complain about; the new employees their either can't count are is trying to save the company money on certain condiments (honey roasted bbq). I now have to check my bag before leaving the drive thru or come inside to get it which is frustrating. If I order a four count strip with a large fry, asking for a few packs of condiments should not be difficult.  So you only get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Though I do not agree with their politics, I like the food here.  It's clean, and the service is quick."}
{"text":"The customer service is fantastic! From the sweet lady that opened the door for us, to Tom taking my order. He was such a pleasant young man. So polite and cheerful, as well as the man that brought our food. Deb stopped by to greet us and ask if we needed anything. Every single person we came in contact with, was wonderful. The restaurant was clean and tidy. And our food was hot and fresh.  Completely exceeded my expectations. A++"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, great service and quality food. My kids play in the play area they love it! They have a play area setup with a race car, space ship and tunnels. I know I have been up there! The kids play the whole time while I enjoy a peaceful Spicy chicken deluxe sandwich and waffle fries with a large cup of sweet Ice tea....  Doesn't get much better than this ;)
Chocolate chip cookies are awesome!"}
{"text":"For safety you can't beat Chick-fil-A in the food court.  The food is fresh and clean.

Nothing to report because unless they mess something up or do something spectacular this is just another Chick-fil-A like the others.  My lack of additional review is in itself my review."}
{"text":"Usual fast service and very friendly workers! Waited 2-3 minutes for my food only on a not too busy afternoon. Stop by here for a quick meal if you have a tight connection! 

Located in the central food court area at the Charlotte Douglas Airport"}
{"text":"Normally I would give Chick-fil-A a 5+ rating, but today when I stopped by the Chick-fil-A on Bell Road in surprise and ordered a bowl of chicken soup I was surprised when I took the lid off and started eating the soup. The chicken soup instead of the white chicken breast pieces it normally has had In the soup in the the past... and pieces of what look like leftover nuggets with the breading still on it. Not exactly what I wanted to pay $5.50 or eat as I have been sick for 2 days and I was looking for your regular chicken soup.
This will not change my mind on chick-fil-A but I was very disappointed today."}
{"text":"I tried the spicy chicken sandwitch and chicken strips. Environment is great,  people were nice and friendly. Chicken sandwitch  was overrated wont be gettin that again tasted to plain but other than that the lemonade and strips with bbq sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"Never experienced such bad service at a chickfila time and time again.  There are some great employees here, but a lot more that ruin it for the good ones."}
{"text":"As an ASU student the downtown location makes it nice to have one of my favorite restaurants on campus. They have a limited menu but plenty of items to choose from. Smaller location with plenty of seating inside and out. Right on the corner so you can't miss it. 

I will warn you the food seem to be pre cooked and heated under a heat lamp. So it is not as hot and fresh as other locations. Though you will get your food fast. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"If every day could be a Chick-fil_A day, I would choose this location. Yesterday, was my first time dining in. I have used the drive-thru often which has always been a smooth process, but my dining experience surpassed my expectations. You feel the positive energy the moment you walk in the door. Wow! a busy lunch hour rush with all hands on deck working hard actually enjoying their jobs. Everyone at the cash register had a smile. I went through the line fast, my order was repeated to me and delivered to my table. As I dined and ate my food, I witnessed how happy the staff was. They were pleasant to everyone they encountered. I had to give the working manager a kudos. Ended up being the owner's wife. I told her this was the best service I have ever received. I am from Phoenix and have seen locations come and go. Then to grow to one of the best fast food chains. Well, I am glad they are here to stay."}
{"text":"We come here often and the service has continued to decline. A lady in front of us complained that her coffee tasted bad, which it always does and that's why I no longer order it. The two ladies behind the counter both rolled their eyes and said to the customer \"well it's fresh I don't understand the problem\". The short haired lady continued to act unprofessional with her body language and overall tone. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This location has AMAZING customer service. I've never encountered someone who wasn't friendly. Brennan is my favorite. The food is usually always fresh. I highly recommend the bacon,egg and cheese biscuit  breakfast sandwich,its amazing. They also make delicious milk shakes and the lemonade is awesome. I think I like just about everything about this location."}
{"text":"Over the years, I have taken a strong liking to Chick-fil-a.  The chicken is tasty and is not processed like the other fast food restaurants.  The waffle fries are delicious.

The staff is extremely friendly and at times will come to the table and offer free soda refills.

Each Wednesday they have a Kids Night from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.  Last week there was a balloon artist.  It is a fun time had by"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how fast it was to go thru the drive thru.  It was at least 50 cars ahead of me, seriously it took less then 5min from the time i entered the line until I drove off.  Wonderful experience.  Live on the SW part of town and will difantily make the trip to get a chick filet.  Chicken breast was perfectly grilled to perfection.  Not dry but moist and supple.
UMMM UMMM UMMMM wish i had one right now."}
{"text":"Love me some Chick Fil A!  Haven't eaten there since I moved from northern VA over 7 years ago.  Went to both opening day and went back a few weeks later.  Definitely worth the wait, their sandwich is out of this world (although my son loves their chicken nuggets).  Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusted with this place. Ordered a chicken noodle soup for my daughter who wasn't feeling well. We get home & the soup was sour (spoiled)! Left a message for the manager to call me back. Never heard a peep. The worst customer service & food quality ever. & this is the second time I've gotten unsatisfactory service. Never will I ever go there again!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that Chick Fil A is finally in Vegas! I really wish there was a location more near me, but this is closer than Utah/Cali so I am not complaining :) my sister & I originally drove to the eastern location, and ended up at the Stephanie one because we hoped the line would be smaller. We were wrong, the line was CRAZY long. We went through the drive thru which wrapped around another building. I do have to say though, we really didn't wait that long at all. It went by so fast I was so shocked! Everything was so organized which is why I think it went by so fast. They gave you menus while you wait in the line (drive thru) & then someone will come up and take your order & while you get closer someone takes your payment & then finally you get your food & while you're driving away they have people that pass out the condiments. The food was amazing. We each got a spicy chicken sandwich with lettuce only. Juicy, flavorful, with a bit of a kick to it. The waffle fries were good too. This was only my second time having Chick Fil A , but definitely not my last. My sister had it for the first time & she kept saying while we were waiting that this place is probably over hyped and it won't even be THAT GOOD. She ate those words Hahaha she said it was delicious and she was shocked at how good it actually was. Can't wait to go back already :)"}
{"text":"Seriously? What's this about? So much hype for what?
This is no better than Wendy's or Burger king. Maybe  better  than  McDonald's but that's not saying much seriously standard at best
Want a chicken sandwich PDQ right up Sahara 2 minutes away 
Treat yourself life is too short to eat substandard food."}
{"text":"Staff gets 4stars for being quick and friendly, but traffic is heck.  several people who were turning left out of parking ended up cutting across to turn right then U turn later on.  

new sriracha sauce is nice, combined with texas pete's hot sauce. 

no discounts, but shop app for deals. 
t-t-t-that's all folks"}
{"text":"Always good. Always clean. Always consistently high quality chicken. I love the spicy chicken sandwich and my wove always gets the regular deluxe. This location was just like others we have tried. The bathrooms were spotless."}
{"text":"OK so yes this is a fast food restaurant and you're not going to get a 5-star meal. But regardless, for those who really enjoy Chick-Fil-A when you find one (we have none in Washington...) it's such a treat. I have to say the food and service was just as I expected. Food was delicious, can't beat the spicy chicken deluxe with waffle friends and PLENTY of Chick-Fil-A sauce. Oh, and the buttermints! The crew is always so polite and friendly.

This place is also great for kids. Fun menu options, a neat play structure and I really appreciate the details they think about, such as an eating/entertainment mat for kids you can stick on the table."}
{"text":"Very long lines in the drive-through. Long lines are OK as long as they're moving. Unfortunately service at the window must be slow because the lines are going extremely slow. I watched a number people drive away and didn't want to deal with the lines of the parking lot.  Food is good but is it worth the wait?  Not really."}
{"text":"This is a great Chick-Fil-A.  The employees are so nice, the management is always out on the floor assisting customers and cleaning tables.  They will bring your food to you which is nice when you are with small kids.  The food is standard so no variation from the norm.  And its pretty much the only Chick-Fil-A in the area so they have that advantage, which means it can get busy, but they handle it well."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this was a lunch stop en route on a long road trip from Ohio to Florida, and as a result, this is the only place I've ever been in South Carolina.

However, this Chick-fil-A. surpasses brand standards, and deserves a review.  It was super crowded on a Saturday around lunchtime, but the restaurant (including the restroom) was very clean and the employees handled everything with ease.  Our chicken strips were cooked perfectly, the waffle fries were excellent, the order was accurate, everyone was exceedingly polite, and we were back on I-77 within minutes.

It's always a pleasure, Chick-fil-A.  (And hopefully I'll get to see more of your pretty state one day!)"}
{"text":"I am a huge chick fil a fan but this is honestly one of the worst chick fil a locations I have been to. Thought maybe the one time I went was just a fluke but went back and the quality was exact same. There's nothing like ordering the breakfast scramble with cold eggs and cheese straight out of the fridge that couldn't even come close to being melted. It's sad such a great food chain really struggles at this location. In addition to subpar food they are one of the slowest chains I have ever been to."}
{"text":"If you're a Queen's student you can get a free fried (unfortunately they won't swap it for the grilled) original or spicy chicken sandwich on Wednesday's with purchase of a drink and fries (you CAN swap the fries for a salad!). It's a good option for the struggling or study oriented student. Plus, Chick-fil-A offers free wifi, so you might be lucky enough to snag a spot and put in some study time. If you need an extra boost of caffeine, try an iced coffee for your drink option!"}
{"text":"Who would've known I'd be such a fan of Chick-fil-A?! This location is awesome, not sure if it's the small town feel, but they are teaching the staff how to make customers feel like royalty. And it's not just about the chicken sandwiches these days, they offer up some delicious breakfast options, including their chicken biscuits. With free wifi and unlimited refills, you might just find yourself making this location your favorite new study spot [except on Sunday's of course]. Located right off I-85, it's conveniently located and once again, they have awesome staff!"}
{"text":"I love the new Spicy Chicken Biscuit.  The staff here is awesome and your order is turned around very quickly.  I love it here!"}
{"text":"I went 3 days ago and got a meal of Chick-fil-A Nuggets with waffle potato fries and a lemonade drink. The nuggets are ok, I think the fries were better. And the lemonade was too sweet too much sugar...diabetes? As for the sauces, the only one I liked was the bbq but they stingy with them."}
{"text":"Super nice employees and great food. However it's a little pricy compared to other nearby fast food options, and the inside wasn't very clean or tidy during my visit."}
{"text":"Pros:  Food taste and quality is great, staff is nice and trained well, restaurant is clean. 

Cons:  lines at drive thru are sometimes too long, they stop selling chic n minis at 10:30am these should be available all day, sometimes food comes out sloppy but still delicious even if it looks messy."}
{"text":"Usually I love Chick-Fil-A's breakfast but this morning was HORRIBLE!
I got grilled nuggets to switch it up from my daily breakfast sammy and I had 3 bones within the first 7 pieces. I thought I broke my tooth on the last one. That cured my hunger for Chick-Fil-A for a looonnngggg time."}
{"text":"It's chick fil a. What more needs to be said? And this one is better than many. They are fast, friendlier than usual, and not stingy with the sauces when requested. I value that. Back east if you ask for 5 sauces, they don't baton eye. On the west coast, they don't really understand the Chick Fil a principals and give you the stink eye of you request more than two packets of sauce for a large order of fries. This restaurant promotes the practices I was accustomed to on the east coast. Kudos to all the employees here."}
{"text":"I have always been a CFA fan over the years. In fact, if you pore through my profile long enough you will see Cfa reviews from Florida, Arizona, California, and (maybe) Texas.

Those chicken sandwiches are always scrumptious and those waffle fries are always crisp and tasty. I HAVE to get myself to try more menu items one day, but I just love those chicken sandwiches so much that it might be a while!

Plus the service has ALWAYS been so friendly and kind. Especially from the guys taking the orders on the outside all the time. The guy that took my order today (I believe his name was Aiden) was very engaging and personable. Good service always makes a great impression, no matter where you go!

Chick-Fil-A is always consistently good quality food with friendly service with a smile. What's not to love?? I will be back. Repeatedly.


4 stars."}
{"text":"What can I say?? It's another Chick-fil-a. Really wish those guys would take their Sundays off and build a couple of those locations up here in Las Vegas. Don't be scared! We'll just eat mor chikin!!

This location was solid. Always smiling, friendly employees there to assist and take your orders.

The chicken is just as yummy as ever! I \"stocked up\" on a shit-ton of these sandwiches before heading home.

The bathrooms were a little nasty, which is the only reason I knocked a star off. Otherwise, Chick-fil-a is pretty reliable, pretty consistent, and pretty damn good!

4 stars."}
{"text":"Yes. You read that right. I hit two different Chick-fil-a locations in the same day. ....and I'm not even a little ashamed to admit it! I love their product! 

We stopped by this location around noon time. It was pretty busy, but we still got quick speedy, and friendly service from the young lady who took our orders. Everything arrived quickly and all orders were accurate....and it goes without saying that the food, as always, was luscious! Yes, I said it....lusious!

Mmmm, MMmmmm.MMMM! Love me some Chick-fil-a! Eat Mor Chikin!! lol Whatever, just make me my sammich!!

The older  lady who refilled our drinks was very kind and pleasant as well. 

Only difference between this and the other location we visited was their bathrooms were nice and clean!


5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"This Chick Fil A location in Henderson is basically on the other side of town from me. But we just happened to be in the area earlier today and decided that CFA sounded pretty good!

(+) Food, as always, is great! I just can't get past that Chick Fil A Sandwich w/ cheese and waffle fries combo! So.frickin'.good.
(+) Lines were not nearly what I have experienced at both other locations in town. Service was reasonably quick and friendly. They are always smiling! 

(-) parking situation sucks. Only space available for me was along the Stephanie Drive side. Unfortunately the drive thru line runs right along with Stephanie Drive as well, which means if there is a line for the drive thru then you are effectively blocked in your parking space until the line goes down. Not cool.

Other than that, it's a pretty standard CFA location. Then again, that is a very good thing since you can almost always count on getting good service and great food at CFA!


4 stars."}
{"text":"There aren't many companies I can say with certainty are always 5 star worthy. But this business, is one of them. Customer satisfaction is top priority for them. They would rather cut off a toe, than see you dissatisfied. These people are hardcore.

This location is in a busy area off Howe avenue and they see tons of traffic. However, that doesn't stop them from being super friendly and efficient. Sure, you won't get through the drive through in 2 minutes flat....but you also won't end up eating mystery meat with \"special sauce.\" 

Ordered their spicy southwest salad for the very first time and got the avocado lime dressing with it. Sweet baby Jesus! That salad rocked my socks. I sincerely moaned the entire time I was eating it. Washed it down with an unsweetened iced tea. 

Fantastic experience and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Very satisfactory food, my mouth watering with each bite of the chicken sandwich 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"I ate at this location for my first Chick-Fil-A experience and I'm now a die-hard converted lover! Staff was helpful and more than willing to make accommodations for my nutritional concerns and desires for my meal. I was so happy to know that I could order a breakfast burrito by my preference with no issue (egg whites only, no cheese, with hash browns!), and the staff was more than happy to outfit me with all the sauces and accoutrements I desired. I loved the waffle fries I got, and their sugar-free lemonade was absolutely scrumptious. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good chick Fil a. Clean area and helpful staff. Drive hrough is always packed and this shopping center is ALWAYS busy so beware of the drivers. Price is worth it for the product. The only downside-  you always want it on Sunday's :("}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chick-fil-A. Delicious chicken, family oriented. They have great family nights once a month. Friendly staff, and great customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cobb salad for the first time and it was amazing you have so many dressing to choose from as well. The place was clean and extremely busy lunch time. The staff was friendly as usual. I come to this location plenty of times for lunch and never had bad experience"}
{"text":"Always get the best service here! This is a very busy location however, they slways manage to prepare my order quickly."}
{"text":"Ordered 12 count nuggets and SMALL chocolate shake. The price for a small shake is ridiculous! Over $3, why?? Highly disappointed, they're seeming to become greedy and over charging for certain items."}
{"text":"Chick Fil A is so good! I love the regular chicken sandwich with extra pickle. I love how there is nothing else on it. Plain jane. My 4 year old daughter picks off the breading from any nuggets and strips, so it's really great that they offer grilled nuggets! No breading. Very nice staff. Clean playground and tables. Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"I usually come here a lot and chic fil a is normally good food but today my wife got a spicey chicken sandwich and the oil it was cooked in must be dirty cause the chicken was dark dark and it didn't taste the same at all. So I took it to an employee and she threw it away and got us a new one and it looked Aracely the same so I went up to the counter and the  lady went to the back and came out and said that they change their oil every month well that's disgusting!! You should be changing it way earlier than that. Like 2 weeks at least. I'm going to send in a complaint"}
{"text":"Same delicious food at the Charlotte International Airport now. They haven't been open very long. Still closed on Sundays. They need to iron out the ordering pick up process. Had a tight connection today. They had an army of employees working. Same friendly \"my pleasure\" as always. Over 40 people were waiting. At some point you need to quit taking orders and reset in the kitchen.  There were 20 people that ordered before me that were still waiting when I left. The food is great just improve the flow of receiving \"fast food\". I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"It looks like reviews are all over the place for this location which surprises me.... I used to eat at this location all the time on my work break and they were always super friendly, fast, accurate, delicious, clean - I mean really great for fast food.  I love the chicken nuggets best as far as the menu goes.  Real chicken too - none of that fake mechanically processed chicken parts.  This restaurant somewhat restores my faith in fast food.  :)"}
{"text":"Ok. So clearly their app needs work and manager needs to take a course in customer service. Very rude management that should not be the position they are in."}
{"text":"Great chicken and great waffle fries. It's always really busy because it's still pretty new. They actually have an app and if you order from the app you can walk right in and get your food no need to wait."}
{"text":"Me and my BFF were like giddy teenagers at the opening of this place. She is from the South and I'm from FL which we had Chick-Fil-A's freaking everywhere.  We literally have to drive to CFA in Rancho Cucamanga to get our fix which is way far away so we only get it when we are heading to the West Coast or L.A.   Those days are now behind us now that this place open. I can't believe I saw some ppl weren't happy this a.m. with CFA on their grand opening.  We arrived around 11am or so and had pretty much perfect service, great food (YUM) and the staff was happy as well as all the customers in line.   We had a classic sandwich, 4 piece FIL-A- strips, waffle fries.   My Mother tells me she loves the chicken salad sandwich and one day I will try it.  I am hungry again and it's dinner time and I wish I had some more CHICK-FIL-A.  Darn, why didn't I bring some home!   Don't be stupid like me and bring some extra for your family or friends home and then you will prolly end up eating it yourself !!!  LOL, it's the \"thought\" that counts!!!!!

 By the way, met the cow ! Had our pix with him. That was AWESOME!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Melissa very happy and helpful. Refilled my tea and took my trash and was very pleasant. Employee of the month material"}
{"text":"The employees here aren't like the majority of other Chick-fil-A s, they aren't super friendly, don't listen to what you are trying to order, or check the bags before giving it to you, so you should remember to check that your order is right, or even close to what you ordered."}
{"text":"I come here all the time even though I don't check in every time. The quality of this location has gone down and so has the customer service of the employees. Sabrina was the one in the window on this trip and she was almost rude. Like I was a burden asking for the sauce that they had asked if we wanted while ordering."}
{"text":"Let me just say I LOVE Chik-fil-A!  We went here to get a snack and got a 12 count for 3 of us and I am so glad we pulled into the parking lot to eat them. Apparently whomever made the package couldn't count and shorted us."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food chain out there !!  This location especially has excellent service with an extremely polite staff!  Never a bad meal or an incorrect drive thru order.  Always the old standby when you can't decide where to eat !"}
{"text":"Not the first time - greasy, nasty, pics speak words.  Unwrapped the chicken sandwich and the wrapper was greasy. I patted with a napkin and worse, super greasy.  After the third time, I thought, \"really? I'm not eating this....\". One word, \"disgusting.\""}
{"text":"I'll say this much about Chick-Fil-A.  Their website has a good health information page http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Food/Healthful-Lifestyle and a good meal calculator page http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Food/Meal#?  You wouldn't believe how many calories are in a chicken sandwich.  Think chicken wraps are healthy? Think again my friends.  We're talking calorie and carb bombs here.  

A far better choice is the chargrilled chicken & fruit salad.  This thing comes in at under 300 calories and is my personal favorite.  Start out with some chargrilled chicken and two types of lettuce, throw in some cabbage and carrots, then add some strawberries,  grapes, red and green apple slices and mandarin oranges. Top it off with a little bit of light balsamic vinaigrette. Hey, now we're talking!"}
{"text":"Jessica and nia were great.   Customer service to the rim or is it brim.    Food was quite good.  My friends love it.   It was my first time."}
{"text":"Food is always good but the service is amazing. And they have people working outside in the drive thru which makes the line go super fast. I love how you can get as many sauces as you want. Forever a loyal chick filet customer!"}
{"text":"Customer service is NOT dead! I found evidence to this claim this morning at the Chick-fil-A at Deer Valley (I-17 & 101). Of course I've never had bad service at any of the Chick-fil-A's I've dined at. But the customer experience this morning was exceptional enough for me to lift my ban of chain restaurants.

I would guess that the number one complaint or reason for giving a bad Yelp! review stems from bad service. Having worked in the industry more than a few times, I notice these things. So when I see someone (or a whole lotta someones) doing their job at what I consider an \"old-fashioned level\", I want them to know it was appreciated.

This morning, while in the area, I stopped in for breakfast at what I thought might be a healthier alternative to standard industry fare. I was right! The Egg White Grill was delicious, not to mention under 500 calories. And who knew the coffee at Chick-fil-A was this good? But the great food here is only a part of this review.

The couple ahead of me in line got into an argument at the register, but the cashier kept her composure and continued like nothing happened (and you wonder why you get bad service!) and smiled the whole time. And the cashier who took my order (Johnna) was very pleasant, helpful and also smiled the whole time. They aren't fake smiles either. You can hear how genuinely friendly the employees are in their voices.

This Chick-fil-A is a little difficult to get to unless you're already in this shopping center, but it's worth your time if you want an alternative to the zombies that are hired at nearly every other fast food restaurant. Great job! You earned your day off tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Once again, the service at another Chick-fil-A has captured my attention... I don't typically review chain restaurants, and I've said this many times on Yelp! Chick-fil-A is establishing itself in my mind, as one of the very few chains that still have and uphold any standards.

Menu items are constantly being changed and updated. It's not just a chicken sandwich joint. Their breakfast items are amazingly diverse! And that is also part of the reason I'm writing this.

The Arizona Coyotes have featured a Chick-fil-A promotion for at least a few seasons. When they score a goal in a designated period, the fans win a free breakfast item. While the Coyotes haven't scored enough goals to be a good team, they have sent me home with several of these promo cards.

So on my way to work, early in the morning, I've dropped in to the Arcadia Chick-fil-A a lot recently. You will be hard pressed to find a nicer, friendlier group of people at 6 AM. And I'm not just there for a free sandwich. Their coffee is excellent!

I've been on a hybrid protein diet (my own plan) and having the occasional Egg White Grill works for me. And it's a tasty menu option!

Thank you Chick-fil-A for providing delicious and healthy menu options, but most of all, thank you for all the smiling, polite service!"}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru and slowest service. I have tried to give them chances but it never gets better. Last week was the final straw. I was behind one car and no one was inside and it took forever."}
{"text":"The Good - Feed a family of 4 for $20 (sans sodas).

The Bad - Sodas are behind the counter so asking for a refill is a drag and not worth purchasing a soda.

The Ugly - Closed Sunday."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat.  Great addition to the area when the Riverview shopping area came to be in West Mesa.  My favorite is a number 7.  Grilled Chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and a drink.  Love their frosted lemonade too."}
{"text":"Outstanding Service is the byword here. I cannot get over how well they treat you as a customer here. Many restaurants should take a clue from the service perspective here and what must be an excellent training program for the employees.

The Chicken sandwiches are great (hot, fresh, tender and moist with or without breading)  with the Spicy Chicken being my favorite. Not just me, but my entire family are fans. Linda goes for the Grilled or Nuggets, Jody for the Classic and me yes I usually stick with the Spicy.  The chicken is fresh and cooked properly every time. I have never had a miss on that. I think someone mentioned that the waffle fries were not great and I agree but they are decent enough and I frequently order and enjoy them with my drink and sandwich. 
This place is also kept very clean and the ordering process is very efficient and fast. When there are lines, which is often, they move swiftly and your are at the counter before you know it. Give your order and your food with be with you in not much more than a minute and they will bring it to your table if you ask.
I think I'm getting hungry again. 'eat mor chikn'"}
{"text":"Let's be honest does Chick-fil-A need a review. It's Chick-fil-A for Christ sake. I have a cousin in NY hates that I have access to Chick-fil-A and he doesn't. He takes a train to NJ so he can get his fix.  No matter how much I get tried of fast food I am never tried of Chick-fil-A. Its chicken and I'm black guy I never really stood a chance.(laugh it's ok) Go to Chick-fil-A now. Stop reading and go and get a spicy chicken sandwich. Dang it I'm hungry now."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight. The staff was as usual very friendly. The food was hot and delicious. I was in an especially irritated mood due to not feeling well all day and they offered my little girl a free ice cream cone which made her happy. It turned my whole mood around. And the chicken noodle soup was just what I needed."}
{"text":"I go here a lot just because my son loves the waffle potato fries from here. But I feel cheated most of the time because of how much fries they give you, the carton is never full. But this time I've had it with them.. I don't know if it's the employees just being stingy or it's their company policy to give you half of what you pay for. Even if it is just a couple of bucks, I work hard for my money and I shouldn't have to feel cheated by big companies like this one."}
{"text":"I really don't feel as if I need to sell anyone on Chick-fil-a (it's amazing). However, it is important that I mention the cleanliness and superior service at this location. In particular, Ryan, made my dining experience 100%. Top notch!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was super! Usually when you're at a fast food restaurant you don't expect anyone to check on you.  Basically you get your food, sit down and eat.  Here, a woman came and checked on us twice! She even offered to throw our trash and then a third time to offer us mints!!! To be honest the food is pretty good but not amazing...the service though, it was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Love this Chick Fil A! The food is always fresh and tasty and the staff is friendly and they aim to please. Used to love taking the kids when they were little, but now it's mostly the drive thru for us. Either way, we've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a on point. This one is the closest to my work it's always way busy but they are still super fast."}
{"text":"I like Chick-Fil-A but it's too expensive for fast food. There isn't anything about their food that makes me think a single chicken sandwich should be that price. Their fries need a ton of salt for me to enjoy them. I'd be lying if I said that their chicken wasn't good but I rarely come here unless I have one of those GET A FREE SANDWICH coupons. Otherwise I always feel like I'm getting ripped off.

Also 

PS: Chick-Fil-A, being closed on Sunday does not make this Utah. You're still in Arizona where employees usually don't mind working on Sundays and customers get frustrated if a place is closed all day."}
{"text":"This isn't a knock on this Chic-Fil A in particular, but more for the company as a whole.
You cannot run a business and bring religion into it. It's bad for business to go make a public stance against something that a lot of people in the world are starting to support, like gay marriage. 
The chicken itself if really good, BUT the prices are wayyyyy to steep. I always crave the chicken and want to stop here but the food is simply too pricey for what you get. 
The reason they get 2 stars for me is because the food itself is good and the service, however is ALWAYS super friendly. I've never seen one horrible chic fil a worker. 
Just change your prices and keep religion out of your business and you'd be an amazing fast food chain."}
{"text":"Fast food is what it is but if I have my choice a grilled chicken salad or sandwich from this store is my 1st pick!
Their newer Southwest Spicy Chicken Salad is the perfect blend of spicy and crunchy. Add a few chili lime pepitas & tortilla strips that are included and you have yourself a $12 salad from any restaurant but $7.75 from CFA. 

Thank you CFA for giving me an easy way to stay healthy, eat on the go and not break-the-bank!"}
{"text":"The food was great as usual but now I cannot return. I opened my cup of Sprite to eat some ice on this hot Arizona day and to my surprise a nice long dark hair in my drink. Disgusting. I can only hope that nothing got into my food. Hair nets are an industry standard that Chick Fil A doesn't seem to follow. Eat here if you like hair in your drinks and possibly food!"}
{"text":"New owner is awful. Has zero clue how to run a business or treat customers with any respect. Took 15 minutes to bring my food, which was then cold then the owner blamed me for his staffs massive incompetence. Offered zero apology and never ever even asked me what happened. He was rude and physically threatened me. 

Chick-fil-a needs to revoke his ownership. I will be contacting their corporate but stores are owned by people so probably will be meaningless interaction. 

The owner should not have customer contact ever. 

Do not go to this location ever. They won't be around long with this owner and staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a superb dining experience and exemplifies what Chick Fil A is all about. The employees are always cheerful and upbeat, attentive, and courteous...To the point where there is no doubt that they are sincere when they end each interaction with something to the effect of 'it is our pleasure to serve you.'  Many other restaurants, and I think our culture at large, would benefit by taking note of the way Chick Fil A employees go about their work.  

The restaurant tables, and restroom are always clean.  The food is fresh and tasty.  Try the ice-cream... It tastes just like the home made ice-cream I've eaten at family holiday parties for my whole life. I especially enjoy the App and the convenience it offers to order ahead.  

To the manager, please continue to do what you are doing... It works.  

I don't eat fast food much anymore, but when I do, this place is at the top of my list."}
{"text":"I am rarely here earlier enough to enjoy, but I love the nuggets and fries, wish they had the whole menu though, lemonade is good too, wish we had a full one in town!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you expect from Chick Fil A.  Consistent food, and great service and a clean restaurant.  Definitely the best of the fast food chains and this one is definitely good.  Only drawback is that is usually very busy, but that is a testament to the food and the experience."}
{"text":"The food was subpar this time. Usually I always have a good experience, but my fiancé and I's spicy chicken sandwiches were soggy as well as the waffle fries. We ordered the diet lemonade and we got a regular one too. They just tried to rush us through which was weird because it wasn't a busy time. Will not go back to this one."}
{"text":"Yes, I know-5 stars for a fast food restaurant, but I swear, this place deserves it.

When I was a kid, it was always a treat to walk by the Chik-Fil-A in Metro Center and be lucky enough to get a sample of their delicious chicken, and would feel even luckier to have money in my pocket to buy a sandwich from here.

Well, my man had never eaten at this chain, and since we had a very long road trip home ahead of us, we decided to have an early lunch here on our way out of town.

This is not cheap fast food. It is high quality stuff-juicy chicken, fresh ingredients, nice fruit cup (including strawberries) for an alternative to fries. The cleanest bathroom I have ever seen, people coming to our table to offer up drink refills, asking if we were pleased with our meals, etc. One reason I like them is that they don't put mayo on their sandwiches!!!

This is a \"Christian\" business. Closed on Sundays, not sure of the politics, but interestingly enough, the only Bay Area location is in Fairfield...

A definite place to try as an alternative to all the regular fast food chains-and to know there is delicious, fresh and moderately healthy food...."}
{"text":"For a fast food chain, not bad. It's clean, bright, fast and affordable. The chicken tastes  great!!! Plus, extra stars for the effort with the fresh flowers on tables, friendly staff, great kid's play area, and the fact that they use real chicken meat instead of pink slime for all their chicken products.

Verdict: a decent place to stop for lunch in between parental errands."}
{"text":"I have a legitimate obsession/addiction to these tasty, succulent, crispy sandwiches. To not serve them on Sundays I think, is a sin.

That's it. That's the review."}
{"text":"WOW I was literally in and out in less than 2 minutes, order, payment, pickup and everything. Chick-fil-A is ALWAYS reliable, friendly, fast and accurate! Definitely recommend!!!
............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."}
{"text":"Always good - customer service was spectacular. Not your typical fast food experience they actually come to your table to make sure you have everything you need/ordered and are satisfied. The food was delicious. Closed Sunday. I would recommend trying this if you never have been to chick-fil-a. Salads are fresh and the chicken is moist."}
{"text":"Do not know what the hype was over will continue to drive my 20 mins to PDQ instead of here the chicken here is not juicy like PDQ nor its fresh here i can taste the frozen product here where at PDQ they do not wven have a frezzer and offer people to take a tour throughout there restaurant if u don't believe it PDQ is hands the best over Chick fil a and canes put together ill save my $$$ and spend it at PDQ for sure and day everyday"}
{"text":"As good as it gets. Friendly, helpful, courteous treatment from all. Second cup of coffee served in dining room. Peach shake out of this world!"}
{"text":"I love Chickfila! This location is great! The service is always quick even when it's busy. I have been here more times than I should share and I've never had a bad experience. 

Drive through is equally as good. The line moves quickly even if it's long. The employees are always friendly and efficient. 

Inside, the tables have always been clean and the employees are more than happy to give you whatever sauces you want & refill your drink. They know how to choose good employees! Other businesses should take notes. 

Chick fila is just a great establishment overall and I support what they're doing. 

Also the cookies & cream milkshake will change your life, you MUST get it. As well as the Chickfila sauce! Yummm!!!"}
{"text":"Someone pease tell me why is my cheese over my sandwich instead of inside the sandwich? Did someone missed that part of training?"}
{"text":"Everything was fine, except that the bathrooms are very small, and crowded. I was really disappointed about that.  Food was good as usual and great service."}
{"text":"We live down the road from this place, so we saw the crowds, police cars and orange cones for weeks. Never having been to a CFA my wife and I were certainly curious to taste the highly praised fast food served here. Friends and acquittances raved about the food, so we were quite surprised to discover that all the hype was over a chicken sandwich with a pickle on top. So we finally visited orange cones and all. The line from the door was about 10 minutes. We ordered and food was delivered to a pick-up counter several minutes later. We were completely disappointed - it was truly just a chicken sandwich. And not very remarkable, the coating is sort of soft and not crispy, I guess that is their trademark, but the meat was fairly juicy and not dry. Just about every other burger joint has a chicken sandwich, many are far better than the CFA's. We found the fries to be tasteless, soggy and after trying a few just set them aside. The Cob Salad is not a Cob Salad. It is just a portion of lettuce with chopped up CFA chicken on top with little else to qualify as a Cobb Salad, that also was left uneaten. Simply, that was our first and last visit to CFA. We are clueless as to all the hype over mediocre food. One final thought, the service is very good, several sort-of managers walk around and stop by the table to make sure all was OK. We did not have the heart to tell them we were not very pleased at all with the food. Want a good chicken sandwich - go somewhere else. Sorry CFA."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Chick-fil-A is one of the best! I love going to eat here so I purchased a \"cow calendar\" which gives you one free offer a month that they designed, this can be downloaded to your App which is awesome!

Pro Tip- download their App to receive free gifts, once you start going often you will get \"just because\" gifts :)"}
{"text":"I love chick fil a salads and have ordered the cobb salad at approximately 30 different chick fil a restaurants. This one was so so disappointing. Was more of a side than a meal. The staff also has very little sense of urgency, which is also odd for a chick fil a. No matter how busy they are, they are always smiling and rushing. Not the case here. Not stopping at this one afain"}

{"text":"This location always takes forever. The drive-thru is slow. The counter help is slow. This morning, I ordered my food, and waited 10 minutes before an employee told me they couldn't fulfill my order. Very sad compared to the great service I receive at ALL other Chick-fil-A locations."}
{"text":"We lived in Orlando, FL for 15 years and Chik-fil-A was one of the few fast food spots we actually liked. When we moved to Vegas a few years ago and found out there were no Chik-fil-A's at all, that totally sucked! Then it happened. The news hit about Chik-fil-A opening their very first location in Vegas. And Henderson at that. Bonus!!! So here we are checking out the brand new location. And it's as good as I remember. Thank you Chik-fil-A for coming to Vegas!!!

Ordered the chicken, egg & cheese bagel. The bagel was nice and soft. The chicken does not disappoint. Also ordered the chicken mini biscuits for my kid and that was super cute. The hash browns are sized nicely about the size of a quarter. Fun and easy to eat."}
{"text":"This place is not easily seen from the street.  Once you get there you find a typical Chick-fil-A with their standard menu of tasty chicken goodness and their waffle cut fries.  When we were there it was very busy, but the staff was able to process all the customers quickly."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Went through the drive-through ordered nuggets they never asked if I wanted to sauce figured that out a few miles down the road had to turn around so I didn't eat them dry.   Get back have to wait in line again and they offer absolutely nothing for the waste of my time and additional gas mileage.  Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Seriously best chick-fil-a I've been too. Service has been great for years n always so quick to get me my fresh food  best spicy chicken you could buy too! Try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"On Saturday this Chick - fill -A is horrible... The service is like going to any other fast food restaurant.... Very disappointed it must be lack of Saturday management."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped at this Chick-Fil-A on our way back from Lake Wylie to Raleigh.  The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly.  You can never go wrong with Chick-Fil-A to stomp out the hunger monster, especially if you have kids.  The lemon pie was also yum.  It helped to cleanse the palate.  I love my chicken sandwich and waffle fries with Polynesian sauce, but sometimes the meal can be a bit much.  The lemon pie, which is a lemon custard on a graham cracker crust and topped with meringue, was light and not too tart or sweet.  Just what I needed to cut the fried food taste.

This Chick-Fil-A is within a shopping complex that's very convenient for the traveler: Starbucks, gas station and Target all within a stone's throw of each other."}
{"text":"Food is okay, like any other Locations.

What made it bad was the lack of willingness to help, attitude and what appeared to be lack of management.

During our visit, we watched people behind the counter, like zombies. When we asked for napkins (because hey we're out at the condiment bar), the lady just points to the counter as she walks away. Once I explained that there were none there, practically yelling it out because she's already walked away, she comes back with TWO pieces of napkins.

The general manager paced back and fourth from the backroom and front desk, but not really contributing. It didn't seem like he knew how to encourage his team and motivate them to do their best. By the way, the Christian values that Chick-filet is known for is now shining through in this location.

I'll be back, only because this is the closest location to us."}
{"text":"Great job on the drive thru today. Order accuracy perfect, good speed, courteous staff."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Chick Fil A. This location is very nice, friendly staff. However, earlier this evening, they forgot my dad's cool wrap. He had already gotten home before we realized this and so, we don't go back. We called to complain, and while we were credited for another one, the young lady on the other line did not apologize. I understand that they probably just very busy, but I think customer service needs to be amped up a little."}
{"text":"Love their chicken strips and the buffalo sauce.  and their waffle fries!!! Super delicious!!! The customer service is always fantastic!!! So courteous and friendly!!!"}
{"text":"When I came here days ago, the line was still out the door but I imagine that it's being handled better than when they first opened weeks ago. They've got their hand held iPad to order from and someone taking your order while waiting in line. You would still have to wait to walk up to the registers to pay though. The person that took our orders told us they had coke products ... turns out they had Pepsi products. Not sure if she was a trainee or slightly confused. 

They also have this person stand at the end of their drive thru to hand out sauces but the cart they had it in was under the sun. I can only imagine the sauces being warm and the ranch spoiling slowly. When the person left the cart unattended, cars started pulling up (blocking the road) and stealing as much sauces as they could. Inside, we had to pay extra for every sauce we asked for. 

Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and an extra order of the nuggets. My gf ordered the chicken strips meal. All that food was more than enough to have us walking out of there satisfied.

Will try again, when the hype dies down."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch. The only downside of this place is it is crazy busy during peak lunch and dinner hours. The staff is very courteous."}
{"text":"I don't know why I ever come here more often. I love Chick Fil-A, love their food, love their service. Let me see! What do I want? How about chicken!!!! Chicken sandwich, chicken tenders, breakfast chicken sandwich and chicken soda?? I wish they had chicken soda!!!! Oh yea, their fries are not that bad either!"}
{"text":"A perfectly good Chick-fil-A. Fast service even during their busy hours. As good as it gets fast-food-wise when you're in a crunch for time."}
{"text":"Came in tonight, a Saturday night, after the 5 pm service at Central Henderson. There was no line inside! I was really surprised, since my past visits to Chick-fil-a yielded mind numbing lines. The seating area was clean, the trash cans weren't overflowing, the condiments/straws/napkins stand was clean and well stocked. We recieved our order extremely fast and everything was correct, warm, and fresh. My one simple complaint is that the music playing was a little weird, but that's probably just my opinion."}
{"text":"Counter service was friendly and efficient.  However, the coleslaw was bland because it didn't have any dressing. I asked and received an order of fries as a replacement, but potatoes were not fully cooked......oh well!"}
{"text":"Chic-fil-a is what it is. This one is a problem. The staff is out of control. The management does not seem to care. They only thing they know how to do is give away free meals when you complain. They never fix anything. You can call, they don't care. You can fill out surveys, they don't care. You can go in with a bad survey for a free meal and they will screw that up too. They get lazy and leave the chicken in the bater too long and it makes the chicken all clumpy and crunchy. When you take it back they give you another one with the same problem. Not impressed with this location. There are two others near by. One North and one in Baxter. Go to them but avoid this one. Problem is too many people go there and don't complain so as long as they are making money...you guessed it....they don't care. So I won't care either and won't be going back."}
{"text":"This CFA is run buy a money loving owner who has a very nice location and serves sub standard CFA food. After being contacted about the Chicken Sandwich being heavily breaded and crunchy she has done nothing to improve it. At one point during or conversation she tried to blame me for the issue and then acted like she had no idea what the problem was. After many attempts and many times going back so she can \"make it right\" the sandwiches are still crunchy and breaded all wrong. CFA corporate is aware and have done nothing to help either.  Everyone who goes there and allows her to server you heavily breaded sandwiches is getting ripped off.

As a side note the staff there is super and do wonderful. I think they are awesome. The problem is there is no quality. The kitchen gets ready to be slammed, leaves the chicken in the breading to stay ahead of the lunch rush and it's gets super crunchy and gross. This can be fixed but the owner does not care."}
{"text":"20/10 would recommend . Went through the dive through and made 3 different orders and the woman taking my order was very patient and kind . They were extremely accommodating to me and every thing I requested such as extra sauce and pepper packets were provided with no question and hesitation . I had a small issue at the drive through when getting my food and the manager fixed it with no questions asked. I love you chick fill a . You a real one !"}
{"text":"Very friendly and professional staff, always great service. My two little girls love the play area."}
{"text":"Nothing really special about the fast food, but the service at this CFA is wonderful. I work in the building next door & stop here regularly for tea. Cashiers know the regulars & greet them by name. Several of them have worked there for years. It's quite unusual to have such nice service at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. It is nice to have this as a quick stop food option. They have a lot of family and community events once and a while. I dresses like a cow last year on their \"cow appreciation\" day and got a free meal. I don't see McDonald's doing that"}
{"text":"When I was child growing up in Phoenix, the smells from the Chick-Fil-A enticed me.   Now, that I'm raising a daughter in Phoenix, the Chick-Fil-A (mainly the play area) entices my daughter.

Food is great (for a fast food place).   Get the Chick-Fil-A app and you'll get free food rained on you like a Phoenix monsoon.   In addition, they sometimes offer free breakfast on Tuesdays.

I don't understand why people complain about the service.   They've been great to me.  What did you do?  Punch a cow in the face?   If you got to complain, complain about their parking lot which only allows you to enter on 44th St.   And someone designed the drive thru line so that it blocks the exit and some parked cars.

This Chik Fil-A offers lots of events like all you can eat nugget nights, Mrs Claus and child friendly crafts.  Pay attention to the signs.   I befriended a lot of parents of toddlers here looking for an indoor play space at night or just outside of the Phoenix sun."}
{"text":"We love Chick-fil-A food but we'll go back to the other location we frequent next time we want some. I spoke with who ever the \"manager\" was at this location more than 5 years ago about a large ladder being stored on top of the area small children play in and apparently it is still not a safety concern to this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of our favorite family spots.  The service is great and the food is always tasty. I really appreciate the family atmosphere. The new menu is pretty cool.  The next time we come will have to try the family style meals."}
{"text":"Worst chic fil a location ever.. every time I go to this location.. they screw my order up and won't fix it!! I guess the whole \"my pleasure\" BS is just something they say!!! Terrible customer service!!!  Terrible!!!"}
{"text":"Always super sweet staff they go the extra mile and always with a smile.. love how they keep it so clean and not with an old stinky towel like other places they used disposable disinfectant towels to clean tables."}
{"text":"First time trying Chic-fil-a, and I don't get it. Why do people wait in long lines to eat fast food chicken? I found nothing special about it. I tossed half my sandwich in the trash. Speaking of trash, why is there no trash cans in the parking lot? Silly way to save on labor I guess. Unfortunately, while I was walking inside to throw my trash away I noticed a lot of trash on the ground in the parking lot. Perhaps Chic-fil-a feels the garbage on the ground is okay."}
{"text":"In terms of a fast food option, this is where I stop.  I can only comment on the drive-thru and it is fast, efficient and accurate every time.  I have a particular meal that I order when I visit and it is quite tailored: 1) grilled chicken, no tomatoes, extra pickles 2) fruit instead of fries 3) diet coke, light ice.  

They've never got it wrong.  Napkins and straw always in the bag - and they seem very happy to serve me every darn time!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Chick-Fil-A in the Valley.  Why? 

1) Consistent food quality
2) Awesome service - the staff will comes around to ask how you are doing &  refill your drinks too
3) Staff is constantly keeping  the place nice & tidy
4) The cow is out entertaining the kid most of the times we're there
5) Playground - cleaner than most places I've had to crawl into to retrieve the kiddies

Like other Chick-Fil-A, they have Family Nights (free kids meal w/ adult combo) and other fun events throughout the year.  The latest event was Princess & Prince Night where it's free kids meals for anyone dress like a princess or prince.  There was a wizard coloring faces, balloon maker & a Princess Belle (not the cheap looking ones) taking pictures & helping the kiddies with the arts & craft.  For a free event this location went all out.  I love it!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: still the worst Chick-fil-A staff I've ever encountered. Consistently awful service."}
{"text":"If there's one thing that I appreciate about this establishment, it's the consistency.  Over the years, I've visited numerous Chick-fil-A restaurants and this location is no different.  The staff is kind, the food is delicious, and the restaurant is clean.  There's not many fast food places like this anymore.  Well done Chick-fil-A.  You have created a new standard for a quick dinner option. 

If you haven't tried Chick-fil-A, this is a great location to start with.  Trust me....Eat Mor Chikin....you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First trip to this store. Had the Chick-n-Minis (3) and a chocolate shake for breakfast and bought 2 gallons of Sweet Tea and a Tray of Chicken Tenders to-go for a potluck.
The shake was about the same quality as shakes at Carl's Jr (4 out of 5 stars).
The minis came on a biscuit-type bun and were tasty (4 out of 5 stars)
Service was 5 out of 5 stars. Cleanliness was 5 out of 5 stars.
The to-go order was exactly as ordered and both were 5 out 5 stars. The breading on the tenders was not crunchy like Church's chicken but more like home-made (tasted like my mom's recipe, maybe that is why it is 5 out of 5 stars for me personally). We tried several of their dipping sauces and they were all good (not overly sweet like some other chicken places).
This store is at the Riverview shopping district on Dobson at the 202 fwy and parking is easy (right at the door). There is a drive-through if you don't feel like getting out of your car."}
{"text":"This chick-fil-a  is usually very good, I've been there many times. The last two times I've gone I got greasy waffle fries, a chicken sandwich that looked like it was from yesterday and just recently a milkshake that was more like very cold milk. Also, the customer service was always spot on. The last couple times I felt rushed and no eye contact.

I went back after work to let the manager know and she was very nice. She replaced my milkshake with a large :) yes, I brought back a 6 hour old milkshake."}
{"text":"We love this chick fil a it is the best   The servers come around to refill your drinks. They have family events. The chicken is great."}
{"text":"On Saturday mornings, the place is packed and rockin', so be prepared to have some sort of wait. On every other weekday, this place is pretty speedy to get through during the breakfast hours. Lunch is easy going also. This is one of my go to chick fil as. If I come a few times a week, some people that work there will recognize me and ask me if I want additional ketchup."}
{"text":"I can never give Chick Fil A lower than 5 stars. 

Always go for the spicy chicken sandwich with waffle fries and chick fil a sauce. You'll never, ever go wrong with it. I believe it should be a crime to have THAT succulent, juicy, and tender of a fried chicken breast."}
{"text":"Eh, it's ok.  Nothing spectacular about their sandwiches.  It's a chicken breast with 2 pickle slices on a bun.  Nothing else.  A simple meal of a sandwich, fries and a drink is nearly $7! If you want lettuce on your sandwich, it's a charge of about. 50. For a strip of lettuce!!!  I'll save my money and get a sandwich elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a busy Saturday afternoon and the line went quickly and received our order just a few min later. The cashier seemed to forget to in put my chicken sandwich so I stopped the person who delivered our food to let him know. He took my order and bought my lunch so generous of and made my afternoon. One of many reason I bring my family here!"}
{"text":"This chain is weird, The chicken is ok and all, but I don't get the people standing outside to take your order at the drive through, this is Phoenix, AZ.

Also don't say \"thank you\" to the employees, they respond with \"My pleasure\" which for some reason really creeps me out."}
{"text":"My doctor says I need more fiber in my diet, she says it's nature's broom. 
I say my diet is just fine, relying on the more traditional staples, such as pink snowballs, fritos, and beer.
I tell her it's not not exactly nature's broom, but it is janitorial in a sense, almost like a mop and bucket. 

But the 'roids need to go or else there'll be an operation she says...one nvolving hot pokers and way too much probing for my liking.
This is where CFA comes in handy.

They have a cole-slaw that's to die for, one guaranteed to promote a healthy colon,
or at best, keep my proctologist's hands (and hot intruments) away from my precious bum, which has yet to break it's maiden with a hot poker or inquisitive finger.

So if you like cole slaw, and your doctor orders you to eat fiber, this is the answer to your... prayers?
You'll be crapping like a sick barnyard animal in no time.

Go CFA cole slaw!!!

Woo Woo, [fist pump]"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff is about as sweet as Apple pie.  I freaking love this place."}
{"text":"We love this place! The spicy chicken sandwich is the best!"}
{"text":"They always screw up my drinks. I bought a Sprite but they gave me water. Waste of $1.50. But the foods good so just figure out your drinks."}
{"text":"Excuse me, I didn't order this \"doggie bag.\"

I'd always been a fan of Chick-Fil-A.  That is, until my recent visit.  I placed a drive thru order and waited my turn in line behind another vehicle ahead of me.  That vehicle had it's windows rolled down and two (cute!) dogs were in the back seat with their snouts peering out the window.  It seems the drive thru attendant couldn't resist their charms, reached out and allowed at least one of the dogs to lick the palm of her hand, undoubtedly smearing saliva.  When my turn at the window arrived, I was certain the drive thru attendant would first wash her hands before serving me, but that never occurred.

Please don't misunderstand.  I, myself, am a pet owner and love my furry friend.  In my own home I am always sure to wash my hands before touching food, utensils, kitchen surfaces, etc.  I was dumbfounded when I was expected to pay someone else for something I would not allow myself to do.

In the interest of full disclosure, the drive thru attendant did not prepare my food, but she did handle the packaging it came in which, in turn, I also needed to handle to have access to the food.  All I could think about was cross contamination.  Had I not been in a hurry, I would have brought this to the manager's attention instead of throwing away food which may have been very good under other circumstances."}
{"text":"They literally ALWAYS mess up your order, no matter what it is. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because it's still chick fil a. Just don't come here if you're in a rush or expect friendly, competent people."}
{"text":"I don't believe I've ever written a review online for anything; usually I just get mad, glower over something for a bit and then move on, but I was floored by my experience today. I've been going to this location for several years and have always had a great experience with Chick-fil-A in general; pleasant, respectful service and hot, consistently good food. This evening, I went through the drive-thru with my friends and we had a larger order. It was a bit complicated, but the employees taking our order before the window and at the window repeated it back to us and it was correct. We get our food, drive the short distance to my house, open the bag and find that they forgot the sandwich for one of our meals--a bit frustrating, but understandable as mistakes happen. I call ahead to let them know that we plan to come by to get our sandwich after leaving less than 5 min. ago from the drive-thru. A very pleasant employee answers the phone, empathizes with my situation, and proceeds to tell me that, at this location, they cannot issue food that was left out of orders if it is not detected in the drive-thru. What they can do, instead, is send me some coupons that will arrive in approx. 1 week. Seriously? I have never, ever heard of a fast food restaurant doing that--ever. I understand  that wrongful claims may be made at times,  but I was more than happy to share my receipt if needed. More than anything, though, I don't want my sandwich in a week--I would like it with the rest of my dinner! As I mentioned, the employees there are very professional and kind, so for that, I give 2 stars. But I am pretty shocked (and disgusted) by this policy. I have to say, I think this location has lost our business."}
{"text":"\"Sometimes we wanna go where everybody knows your name *** & they're always glad you came\" this is exactly how my family feels when we walk into cfami. This is a family for sure. Great people, fab food, and happy happy smiles everywhere you turn."}
{"text":"AZ Chik Fil A has military discount!  Of course delicious chicken sandwiches and waffle fries too. I was exceptionally hungry and ordered 3 chicken sandwiches, waffle fries and a powerade. All food was less than $20 with discount. I also got extra sauces and the staff wasn't stingy and sauce is a must have for me. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this Chik Fil A and it is a excellent location.  I ordered Waffle fries a and chicken sandwiches from drivthru and upon getting home they were delicious.   Staff is friendly at this spot and organized. I hope to try chicken tenders next time as I have never tried them."}
{"text":"Great place and the staff are on the younger side but VERY polite and professional. The place is very clean. Coming here sets a higher bar for other fast food places."}
{"text":"Average Chick-Fil-A. They also have a inside play ground here if your into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"I love Chik Fil A, but for some reason they love to screw up orders at this one. They'll get a higher rating when I can go and actually get my food the way I order it."}
{"text":"Cleaner play area than McDonalds but smaller. But they also provide individual wipes next to the door. Milkshakes are thick and creamy. Inexpensive. Closed on Sundays, though."}
{"text":"I enjoy the spicy chicken sandwich and ice cream cones at this place.  I'm leaving the review because today Robert Montoya was the guy that took my order.  He was professional and kind.  If all the employees here treat customers the way that Robert does then I think this place will be around for a long time.  It's nice to be treated well when you're out for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"What an absolute horrible experience.  I went in on a Saturday morning to grab something quick and get to a baseball game.  I went inside because the drive thru line was long.  I was the only one ordering from at the counter.  I then proceeded to wait 15 minutes my one meal.  

I decided to give them a try another day, and while the wait was not quite as long, I still waited 8 - 10 minutes for my meal.  I do not think I will be going back to this location until I hear of some improvement in their delivery."}
{"text":"This was my first time in a Chick-Fil-A and I was curious. I came here to wait while my husband was in an interview. I had heard things about them in the news. 

Just one dollar sign is in the price range. No way, not even close. For $7, you get a puny salad and a drink. A value meal is ~ $8. Christian or not, it's such a rip-off. 

And the girl that served me had a creepy attitude. When I said \"thank you\" to her twice, for ringing me up and bringing me the food, she responded with a weird, melodramatic \"Pleasure...\"

All the 5 stars below must be employees."}
{"text":"Amazing food never a disappointment. Dayton or server was so friendly and happy even being slammed with customers. One of my favorite fast food places"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, \"I love Chick-fil-A!\". With that said.... this is by far the worst location I've ever visited across 5 states. I only come here now when all the other locations are closed (this one is open till midnight). 

My order has been wrong several times and two occasions (both with different white male managers) they made me feel like I had done something wrong asking for my order to be corrected. These are the only two times I have EVER had a rude encounter with a Chic-fil-a employee."}
{"text":"I feel bad saying I like this fast-food place but it's pretty good overall. Decent salads with lots of chicken and the grilled chicken is legit so calories are manageable as long as you don't use 5 sauces! I try to be sure that only add one so I don't over do it. :)"}
{"text":"Always fast and efficient service here.

My girls love the food and love to play to burn off the calories...lol...not that calories are really on the top of their priorities. :)

The food is consistantly hot and top notch.

It will always be 'my pleasure' to return anytime I am craving well made waffle fries and chicken!!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Chick-fil-a

I've still not had a bad meal here. The staff is friendly and very helpful.

my kids love this place!"}
{"text":"Being able to walk into a place where you are greeted and made feel welcomed is such a great feeling. To have the woman working the register tell you that it might take a while for you to get your food, makes it nice. I usually wait for 10 mins becuase i have no idea whats going on and by then im upset.
She was pleasant and very kind. Other than \"what kind of sauce\" there were no other questions asked about my confusion, she handed me one of each with a smile. Carried my food out, suggested the sauce to try one last time, and again, with a kind smile.

Throughout the whole order process she talked to me and made me feel like i wanted to come back. That's what brings me back the next time. If the workers make you feel welcomed and calm, that's where you belong!

At last a good place!"}
{"text":"Dirtiest chick fil a play area I've ever seen! There were clumps of hair everywhere, all the surfaces were greasy and gross. And it wasn't even busy in there. My kids where the only ones there. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. I'd only even been once before about 5 years ago in SW FL, I remeber it being good - this was horrible.  Dry, overcooked, bland."}
{"text":"I can careless for a fast food! But I work by this chi fil A spot and me and co workers go there atleast once a week. I don't remember one time that I got my order right! Once I ordered today, didn't get my cheese and the ketchup and had to wait 5mins just to get a slice of cheese! 2 nights ago we ordered number one we got a spicy one instead! Like it's just a simple sandwich with a simple order! How can you get it wrong every time! And lately the food is coming old and cold! Either warm it up or cook a new one"}
{"text":"Joetta, Joseph, Deveni, Tayler are all super nice to every customer not just myself as I've seen they take really good care of everybody here.

I come here more and more because they get to know you and you get an extra big smile when they know you but still a great smile even if they don't. Everything is high quality I especially like the Heinz Ketchup containers with the peel off lid first class all the way!"}
{"text":"My pregnant wife left crying about the customer service from this location. Called and spoke with the gm ; who was a good listener ; but unfortunately her staff needs customer service training ; which is awkward to say or even write about chick filet . I don't know if it's just this location ( we go to the one in chandler a lot) but this was her 2nd time at this particular one in over a year. They  are currently 0-2 on the visits . First time our kids order was wrong when we got home .  Just extremely frustrated and disappointed with the money and time that was wasted on such an experience."}
{"text":"lol you can never go wrong with chic-fil-a. Although their prices are a bit high for \"fast food\" their customer service always makes up for it. 

If I'm in a bind and don't know where to eat, I always go here. I rated 4 stars because of the price."}
{"text":"This review is for this location only. I like Chick-Fil-A and have had it numerous times before when I lived in California. Each visit no matter how busy, I've had a pleasant experience until I went to this location. I waited to come visit this store months after it's grand opening because I want to hype to die down a little bit. I went to the drive thru and put the timer  on, just to see how long the wait is, the line wasn't that long so I figured I would be out of there 10 minutes... maybe even 15 minutes top. Well, here's what happened. I see 4, 5 employees taking orders, they have two lanes. Instead of having two employees per lane, I notice one in my lane and 3 on the other lane. Ok, maybe my fault, I went on the wrong line. When I ordered I felt rushed to a point that I accidentally gave them my old card that I reported missing, so of course it's not gonna swipe, when I asked the guy for the card back and offered to give them another card, he said \"oh it approved\". I then drove further. I was stopped by another guy giving out receipts, but was told my card declined. I mean I knew it did so I gave him the other card. I even asked this one approved right??? To which he said, they'll have your receipt at the drive thru window. I was dumbfounded when they can't find my order once I got to the window and had to reorder again and swipe again, even if they had my drink order ready.  I can hear the supervisor say \"we're gonna have a delay, we're barely taking her order\"  They asked for my name again and told me to pull over with my hazards on. I did, but after another 15 minutes of waiting in my car I finally came out and only at that point did I see someone come out with my food. When I asked if that was mine, the girl said, \"I'm not sure, what did you order again? They didn't give me a name or car description\" WTF.  30 minutes of my life wasted for mediocre chicken strips. The strips were to soggy and brown when I got em. Signs of old oil maybe?"}
{"text":"I  ordered 3 chicken strips through the drive through. What I received was laughable. The strips were shriveled little things that were not even warm. I was already on the road so didn't  want to turn around and go back. A DEFINITE RIP-OFF."}
{"text":"The food is very consistent with what you would expect from chikfila. Service is above and beyond. I come here A LOT, a regular. Tried using Android pay because I forgot my wallet but it's not setup yet. They gave me my meal on the house.

A+"}
{"text":"I love this Chick-fil-A they are ALWAYS super friendly, food is always exactly what I order, don't care if I want an entire shipment of sauces, and the long lines go really quick. I enjoy coming to this place inside or drive-thru."}
{"text":"Pricey, but the food is worth it!
All things chicken; save the cows!
Overall very good food, excellent service, but I think I paid $10 for 6 oz of grilled chicken. . .
Oh yeah! Free boardgames to play while you eat."}
{"text":"The staff are very nice although they have training issues.  Every time I order iced tea with a splash of lemonade I am charged for an Arnold Palmer and that is not what I ordered.  I do not blame the nice young man who served, I blame his training or lack there of.  They need to re- train staff."}
{"text":"My second time at Chick-fil-a. This place is always spotless and cheerful but frankly I'm not all the comfortable with the cult vibe these franchises radiate. Everyone seems eerily cheerful, and I mean everyone customers and employees included. 

The food, meh. I thought someone may have pulled a prank on me and replaced my mouthwash with formaldehyde because I could not detect any taste to the so called char-broiled chicken breast sandwich. Nothing. 
1 star

To be fair I had their regular fried chicken another time and that tasted ok, not A-OK great but passable - maybe 2.5 stars. 

The surprise here was the waffle potatoes, they tasted of .... potatoes! Not great stuff mind you, nobody will line up for these fries but in this day and age when the most popular fries fries in the world are artificially flavored and coated reconstituted potato by-product I thought that was an improvement
3 stars. 

I also took home a chicken salad sandwich for my SO, I tasted it and thought it was awful! The dark bread totally overpowered the chicken salad *spread* honestly it was more like velveta than a proper salad with chicken morsels in it. It was already 3 pm and my SO's was too starved not to eat it, but I don't foresee her asking for another one ever ... again. 
NO stars.

Why 3 stars then? 

Because right there on the billboard was the calorie count so you couldn't miss seeing it when you order, and I think it's high time all the peddlers of fake foods did this."}
{"text":"I am writing a review because I have never seen a more efficient drive thru system at work. There was a huge line of cars for lunch, but they had two employees taking orders outside, one taking payment a little farther down, and then I received my food almost immediately at the window. I would estimate that they got through 15 cars in 5 minutes. The food was as good as usual."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about Chick-fil-A in Monroeville. I have been here several times and have never been disappointed in any way. Not sure if it perfect timing or what, but we have hardly any wait time and have always found a seat. 
I like most of the menu. I do like the pickles on a chicken sandwich. I do prefer the tenders to the nuggets. I done care for the waffle fries. 
The lemonade is very good. 
The traffic in the shopping center and the very small parking lot can be a deterrent for some. We have found the best time to be not quite noon and just after breakfast rush. I do like their breakfast! 6 am is a bit early for me but would be good for those heading to work. 
Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Living in the waterfront, we stopped here for breakfast this morning. A family member told us, that they really like the breakfast on the weekends. 
I have to admit I was really surprised, how much I really enjoyed it as well. 
Great service, good food and a clean restaurant. 
Highly recommend the bagel breakfast sandwich! 
The ladies room is the best I have been in, but it was clean."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a purist. I worked for chickfila when I was 16. I had a great time there. It's always clean, the food is quality and the ticket times are under 2min. I'm never disappointed. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Went at the busy hour of lunch, they were on their game in and out of the drive thru in less than 10min. Love the chicken wrap with spicy sauce and love the waffle fries."}
{"text":"Eat More Chicken

Chick-fil-A is always very clean, surprisingly calm, fast food restaurant with friendly, efficient staff.  The menu at Chick-fil-A has a  wide variety of choices including healthy ones.

In addition, to the great selections from the menu you just can not beat the service.  The employees at Chick-fil-A are nicest folks around.  Attentive to your every whim, and eager to please.   

If you decide not to dine in the drive thru provides quick and efficient service on the run and if you decide to dine in - the kids have a place to play while you can sit an relax. 

All in all a good meal at reasonable price. My nephew truly thinks these chicken nuggets are the best, and I guess I have to agree with them I've never had a bad meal."}

{"text":"I love Chik-Fil-A so I figured I would try their breakfast upon suggestion from a friend. Ordered the breakfast burrito with chicken. It was a bit much for me, unfortunately. Didn't care for it at all but I do love the hash browns so that made up for it. Also, the fact that CFA serves Coke Zero totally scores BIG points with me! 

Last time I had CFA was in Tulsa when I was there a month ago. It had been forever & a day since I had eaten there but since my friends love it I'm happy we went. I do love the chicken options & of course the waffle fries.

This location I visited yesterday is a mile from my house & perfect for picking up on the way to work, which was my reason yesterday, & for picking up dinner on the way home or for lunch on the weekend. All very good reasons to pay another visit soon!"}
{"text":"This Chik Fil A is on my way to work and I've tried them for both breakfast and lunch now. I've been happy with the food, completely satisfied with the service, and enjoy the ambience of this place."}
{"text":"Honolulu  could use a Chick Fil A
Their chicken sandwich is simple and delicious. I had the regular and not the bisket.You have a choice of 4 different sauces. The service was great. The manager came buy and offered my group free drink refills . I took star off for the grilled chicken nuggets. They're ok .I'll be back next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Well, everyone else seems to be having good experiences at this location. Maybe I just have bad luck, haha. Well, Chick-fil-A has good food; however, at this location, whenever I decide to show up, the service isn't exactly quality.

My boyfriend and I stopped buy tonight and ordered a #2 and a #3. The girl taking our order thought that I asked for two #2's. I realized it at the window. I wanted to just leave it, but my boyfriend doesn't like spicy food. The girl asked us if everything was okay, and he told her that we wanted the #3, not two #2's. So, she informed whoever was putting the order together. I apologized, a guy told us to have a good night, and we were on our way. Welp, we got home, and discovered we still had two spicy chicken sandwiches instead of one spicy and one deluxe. It may have been a mistake, but it was pretty upsetting for my boyfriend.

Also, the time before that, my boyfriend legit got no chicken on his sandwich. Everything else was there... but not the chicken. There was chicken on my sandwich though... Yeah, maybe my boyfriend is actually the one with bad luck hahaha.

Anyway, probably not going to go to Chick-fil-A again after all this. Glad everybody else can enjoy the good food AND good service!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE! I love Chick-fil-a and will always be impressed because of their incredibly amazing customer service and positivity! The spicy chicken sandwich is always so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is still that good! Super speedy, too. Don't let the long grand opening line fool you. We just got into the line behind the shopping center (second night they're open), and made it the drive thru window with food and sweet tea in hand in exactly 22 minutes!"}
{"text":"I have been to this ChickFilA multiple times and honestly, I won't be back. I'm a frequent ChickFilA customer in general so I have many comparable experiences. The last TWO TIMES I have been to this airport, my (#1) chicken sandwich has not been cooked through all the way. Now, you would think after realizing this the first time, I wouldn't go back but I figured.... It's chickfila. That just had to be a bad day -__- Tell my stomach that was I had an upset stomach and felt nauseous my entire flight. 

I'm generally not a complainer but the management team needs to do something to fix this problem before they have a \"Chipotle\" scare and ChickFilA's go down all over!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-a. This was in my top 3 things I missed from the East Coast (1.Philly Cheese steak 2. Chick-fil-a 3. WaWa ). I was super excited they opened this location and it does not disappoint ! 

I've probably visited at least once a week since they've opened. (I've had to make up for lost time!) Even when the line is super long,the service is quick and professional. I never wait long and have yet to have any issues with service. The great customer service here is refreshing.

I generally order the no.1. The chicken is moist and well seasoned,without being too much. I like that the sauces(BBQ and Polynesian favs) are given on the side and not drenched  over my delicious chicken sandwich. Add the waffle fries and lemonade to complete the experience.  My little ones love the nuggets and waffle fries which have also been perfect.

For a treat I suggest trying the Peach Milkshake and Watermelon Mint Lemonade !

I only wish they were open on Sunday. Oh well, I'll take what I can get. Super happy Chick-fil-a is here to stay."}
{"text":"My husband and I always seem to crave this place on Sundays, imagine that! The one day they are closed! But really, this place, despite how busy they get, still manages to put out great food. And I usually do the drive thru, and I can say with all certainty that their staff is the nicest group of people trained in customer service you will ever interact with. They always sound upbeat, thank me, and tell me to have a great day. In other fast food chain drive thrus, it's difficult to even get a thank you, forget the rest of it! 

I am always happy to give business to this place. Good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Good things come to those who wait! Chick-Fil-A in Nevada was a no brainer! Love coming to this location. Always great service, staff is on point and so polite. Strive to make things perfect! Food is super fresh, waffle fries rule and salads are really tasty! Number 1 chicken place in Nevada!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this was an absolutely terrible experience.  The first ever bad chick-fil-a I have ever been to.  Very unorganized staff.  Felt as if the cashier thought she had better things to do.  They apparently deliver to the table based off the color of the condiment container they give you when ordering, but we didn't find that out until the food was delivered to the table while the other waited for it at the counter.  The employees were o guess changing shifts at  2:30 pm and took up 2 booths talking about how the boss was terrible and didn't understand and the schedules they wanted.  Wrong tshirt sizes for a promotion I guess they were about to have. Customers walking in and airing to have their orders taken with everyone behind the counter either talking about personal business or wiping down trays while people waited to be served.   I will not be back."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever encountered from a manager. She literally refused to take my catering order because the food I requested was not on trays. I placed the same order yesterday without a problem, but didn't deal with the manager. An employee was kind enough to answer the phone and take my order yesterday. 

The manager at this Chick-Fil-A is apparently into refusing business. You don't have to ask me twice to take my monthly $400 catering budget elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Even with the SUPER long looking lines on opening day, I got my food within' minutes of ordering! I went on the inside and only took me minutes to order as well!

I actually did the First 100 opening promotion too! They made it a blast!

The food is definitely soops tasty! Waffle fries! Mmmmmm!

All around polite service! They have dedicated employees to come by tables asking if you need anything! Soda refill, napkins, even throwing out any trash you may have!

EAT MORE CHICKEN!

The owner guy seems nice, calm, and down to Earth!

Believe It!

I'm Gonna Be King of the Chicken Eaters!"}
{"text":"For someone who worked at a Chick Fil A for 2 years in high school I must say I am extremely disappointed in this establishment. I am a reasonable person and give ample opportunities to redeem oneself. Unfortunately this morning was the 3rd time I have been disappointed. First experience after moving to the area and trying this Chick Fil A the restaurant itself wasn't anywhere near the standard of clean I would expect. Second on this same occasion my fries weren't cooked all the way. That's to be expected from a McDonald's or Burger King but come on... Also I was one of two people in the restaurant and felt like the workers were rushing and shuffling me out of there. Maybe that's why the fries weren't done? Third disappointment was this morning when I went to grab a quick biscuit and a decaf coffee (34 weeks preggers and can't wait to get back to caffeine) but to my unpleasant surprise they were closed.  What fast food breakfast place is still closed at 6?! All in all I will say that the independent owner and general managers of this establishment are failing... Horribly."}
{"text":"Wow!! I can't even believe this was Chick Fil A. I have never seen a staff that does not care or even acknowledge that a customer is right in front of them. Food was good but service way below normal when compared to other places...time to clean house. Embarrassing for the franchise!!"}
{"text":"Even though they are super busy, they still keep the cars moving and always are friendly. My order is always correct and the food is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"An update...Still went to this Store last weekend and the food portions on the strips and nuggets were smaller than usual, and the servers still just \"there\" in a sense.  The other chick filas seem to have happier and just nicer employees.  They weren't mean abut they were typical.
But we asked about the military discount or law enforcement discount again and the manager replied that unfortunately we do not do this.  When I asked about how they are the only Chick Fila that doesn't, his reply was \"unfortunately, the owner just doesn't want to consider it.  We know that others have talked about it and mentioned it, but its up to him and he just doesn't want to offer it.\""}
{"text":"I'm a first-timer, and I was impressed.  I brought my son, and he gobbled up the kids chicken nuggets and fresh fruit.  I had a chicken wrap and it tasted delicious!  I was pleasantly surprised...especially for a fast-food joint."}
{"text":"Soon yeah, I took my nieces and nephew here on a Saturday around dinner time. Holyyyyy birth control! I felt like I was in an elementary school. The staff did great though...very friendly as always and I was actually surprised at how clean it was for as many kids there were. 

The play area was a little small but it says it's only for kids 3 and under. Great, but it also says you have to be less than 54 inches to play...do many of you know any 3 year olds over 54 inches? If so I feel bad for your wallets! lol"}
{"text":"Love this place, try the chicken bagel spicy.  Amazing!  Always go here any chance I get.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Very glad that the crowds have subsided, I just love their sandwiches. I also love their waffle fries. Employees are very friendly and helpful. I don't normally like fast food but this place is very good and tasty."}
{"text":"The cashier Adan acted like he was too nervous to take an order. I gave him $20 and my wife said to use $10 off of her card and we will pay the rest in cash. He acted like he understood but had me standing there for a few seconds waiting on imaginary change. That was my damn gas money!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a disappointment with Chick-fil-a! They're always so friendly and quick through the drive through! They also always giving out coupons to earn my business after a great visit! Can not complain! They do a wonderful job for customer service."}
{"text":"Always good food and service, haven't had better service ever than at a Chick-fil-a. All around better service better quality of food, oh and their shakes are like no other."}
{"text":"Shout out to the Chik Fil A team for catering my Audit meeting. The Chicken Biscuit minis  were a HIT!
Everything was organized and they made the minis as soon as I got there so they stayed Hot. And gave me a large complimentary  iced vanilla coffee as well."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday about 2 weeks after they opened. I timed the wait for drive thru took me 31 minutes from when I got in line til when I received my food. Not bad at all!!! My food was nice and hot and everything was correct! They have a nice system set up to make everything go smoothly. Taste wise, I mean it's Chick fil a, obviously delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but the price is way too much for what it is...Avoid Jacquelin if at all possible...she isn't pleased to be working there and seems to think that a fast food worker is a lot better than the average person in shorts and a t-shirt..."}
{"text":"It's a good location but the service is a little slow at night. You can't beat their customer service."}
{"text":"These employees are truly awesome. I've never seen a fast food restaurant care so much about its customers. Especially one w a toddler. So great."}
{"text":"Oh how I love my Chick-fil-a. This is not your average fast food fried chicken. My go to is the regular sandwich but the nuggets are also a solid choice. I'm not a big fan of their breakfast options which is weird because it's pretty much the same stuff. This location gets minus a few stars because it can be somewhat inconsistent. Usually you'll get that perfect crispy chicken but seemingly all too often something just isn't quite right-under fried, over fried or something odd about the seasoning. It's such a bummer when it's disappointing :("}
{"text":"They say every act is political, that even what you eat is political.

That is perhaps more true at Chick-Fil-A than most other places.

It's difficult to be of two minds when you gripe about it's owners beliefs and policies and can't help but love the sandwich. 

So everyone once and awhile you give in. Shhh."}
{"text":"Wow!  Such bad service at the drive-thru.  Had two cars in front of me at 10:45 a.m. and it took about 1.5 minutes per car just to place an order!!!  Then I waited another 3 minutes to get to the window and receive my food (which was not prepared properly).  So it took over 5 minutes to get a sandwich and fries and that was off peak hours!!! For some reason management thinks a live person in a kiosk, handing out menus and chatting up each customer is faster than just driving up to the menu sign and placing an order.  If the queue time averages 4.5 minutes per car, during a lunch rush with 7 cars in line is about a 30 minute ordeal to order and receive your food.  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A! My favorite is the southwest salad and the tortilla soup! I really like the outdoor sitting as well! The customer service is top-notch! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Remove those drive-thru girls ASAP! Was there 6/24 on 2 seperate occasions 3hrs apart and both times was disappointed. First time for breakfast no line, had to repeat my order twice got to the window and order was still wrong, only caught it because I had to re-verify what I was paying for. Girls in there were loud and didn't even acknowledge you because they were too busy carrying on their conversation in spanish laughing and talking loudly amongst themselves while I wait for my correct order. Second time was during lunch rush-hour. The line went pretty quickly because they had two professional young people outside taking orders with digital pads...but once again, once you get to the drive-thru two unprofessional girls with hair untied and blowing, one had very ugly greasy pimpled face, one in the background 'twerking' to music they were playing then looks at me and laughs as if I thought it was amuzing. Still same loud talking in Spanish and when my order is complete they just hand me the bag and give a blank stare. No \"Here's your order\", no \"You're all set\", no repeating your order back to you. It's really quite sad since these are the only people you see as representing this establishment when you're in a hurry and can't go inside. I will probably avoid this location drive-thru at all costs!!"}
{"text":"My first ever Chick-fil-A experience and I was NOT disappointed. The service was fantastic, my chicken sandwich was juicy, spicy and delicious. I can't wait for one to open up in Vegas."}
{"text":"Whew. I've been here for several times for lunch with my co worker, because he fixes their equipment. They are absolutely packed everyday during lunch time. Staff is usually young people, it's Chick-fil-A. It's nothing new, just another fast food joint. However I must say the chicken deluxe is awesome and that's probably the only thing I will order from there. 

Forget their famous chicken sandwich with just a couple of pickles. Get the Deluxe. It comes with cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes! That always makes everything better. Anyways this place is always packed, if I didn't work there then I probably wouldn't come here as often. 

If you come during lunch time my tip:
Go inside, and skip waiting outside for a while as their line stretches out to the exit of the parking lot."}
{"text":"This chick fil a is extremely busy during lunch time! I came here with my mentor for a quick meal during a job. Lines were very long, but our orders were taken promptly and fast. 

Chick fil a is well, the same with all the other chain restaurants? Inside was orderly and clean. I didn't expect less especially since it in south Charlotte. Good place for a quick (if you don't go during extremely busy times) meal.

All in all, I got my quick wrap and was back on the road and to work. Service was prompt, and if they weren't you could possibly get a free dessert (we got offered it, but since we were trying to lose some weight we declined)"}
{"text":"Honestly can't say I can actually be a fan of Chick-Fil-A, but this place has nothing wrong! I enjoy the food here, just not a fast food type of person. I came here early early morning to pick up some breakfast for my parents. They were helpful, courteous, and nice. I didn't have any problem with them and didn't get my order wrong (I would hope not since I was the first customer.)

If you're craving for a fast food joint, I think Chick Fil A could be the healthiest out of the choices. I'm not a fan of fast food so that's why I'm going to give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Recently, I drove up to place my order at the Drive-Thru but found an employee waiting to take my order instead.  I thought maybe the order system was out of order but he told me this was the new way of doing things at Chick-fil-a.   WhiIe I understand the personable approach,  I find it to be invasive and unnecessary.  Besides, it's summer in Arizona and I'm perplexed and concerned that they would have their employees standing out there in the heat even if they do change the rotation often.   I like the old way just fine. I like driving up, taking my time to browse, then pay and leave.  Drive Thrus exist because sometimes you don't want to have all that personal touch.  As I drove off,  I found myself more concerned about the employee standing out there in the heat than I was intrigued by this new service... smh.  They need to rethink this new approach."}
{"text":"We all know chick fil a is known for the great service they have always saying \"my pleasure.\" As I visit this chick fil a I said thank you to the lady twice and she didn't even say your welcome she said nothing back. I found that to be very rude. Because these are reasons why people go to chick fil a for the great service they have. This chick fil a needs to check themselves. No wonder lines are shorter at this location. Smh"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A!! Ahh at last we meet again! So when I use to live in the south (Atlanta, GA) I was first introduced to this gold mind of a chicken shack lol Well not snack but you get what I mean! 

Las Vegas has been anticipating this place to arrive for so long and finally we have been blessed! I've had so many attempts to try them out over the past few months but of course the hype is oh so real and that drive they line is about as bad as waiting in a line a six flags on a scorching hot day! Now because I've ate here many times before I'm not fool enough to actually wait 45 minutes in a drive thru for a damn chicken sandwich! I feel bad for those workers who have to slave in that heat to go around to each car taking orders because the drive thru doesn't move! 

This most recent visit I lucked up and had absolutely no wait so of course I had to eat here! No wait in the drive thru OR inside! SCORE!!! I was in and out within 15 minutes! Is this life?! YES! Will it ever happen again? Who knows! But I hopped my happy ass right back on that I-15 South and chowed down on my spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries! Washed that down with the summertime watermelon mint lemonade ! Yes Lord! I shall return soon!"}
{"text":"This place is in a good location. Compared to other drive thru, fast food restaurants (we won't give any names, but I think you know which I may be referring to), the food here tastes like it was freshly made, not synthetic or artificial. I like the waffle fries. A nice change from the way fries are traditionally shaped. The ice cream is one of the best from a fast food place. However, the food is a bit on the salty side. This is a small store, so when it is busy during lunch hour, expect to wait a little bit. But the food here, I have nothing unsatisfactory to say about it. The staff is friendly. Nice place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I would never go back to this restaurant. We came here with our kids in the late afternoon. The restaurant was filthy. The floor was covered in food crumbs and garbage. The glass windows to the kids play area was smeared and disgusting. There was food on the seats. It was so bad that I actually mentioned it to the boy who brought our food. He said he would clean it up. He came back with a broom and dust pan and proceeded to sweep up the larger items of garbage and that was it. He did not clean thoroughly at all. When our food arrived the chicken nuggets for the kids were so small that it was ridiculous. The people working there were friendly enough but I was grossed out by how dirty it was. I am sure not all Chick-fil-A's are like this, but I would avoid this particular location."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken and berries salad is delicious. I know its a chain but this place does it right. Service is always impecable and the food is consistenly good. Waffle Fries are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Great service and orders don't get messed up here.
Definitely quick when inside."}
{"text":"If it were called Chick-Fil then it'd be about me. But the \"a\" throws me off. 

The popularity of Chick-fil-A has to be primarily political, because it certainly isn't about the food. Then again people do have awful taste in food, but this chicken is so Bland and dry and - especially in Cleveland where you have the wonderful Hot Sauce Williams. I just don't know how anybody can eat it or take it seriously."}
{"text":"Customer service was a five star! I thought I'd give this place about three months till the traffic dies down but surprisingly it was slow around 9pmish. My friend bought a number 1 and I got treated out to a chocolate smoothie and some waffle fries. Loved the customer service from ordering to our food being delivered to our table and once we were done they threw away our trash before we could even get up. I wasn't a fan of the smoothie because my stomach hurt drinking it not even half way. The waffle fries were cute but real waffles would've been excellent. My friend was super disappointed in the chikin being way too salty and the burger was super plain with no lettuce cheese but just a pickle. After two bites he literally said Wendys and Raising Canes were much more better. Besides the food not being something I would go back for, this place is pretty big in size with decorations to look at such as the coke bottles on all the tables."}
{"text":"This  location is the best!! Food is always fresh, faces are always happy and bright. Great service"}
{"text":"Always clean, polite & best sandwich. ...parking lot is way tooooo  small...makes it hard sometimes  to use the drive thru.. but still my go to place"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Chick-fil-A?!? This location does a great job keeping the line moving and get you in and out quickly so you can get to work in the morning."}
{"text":"Food was so delicious! We were first timers.. the place gets busy. Food served quickly! We need one in hawaii! I would return and highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"The food is great, because it is a Chick Fil A of course. However, the service at this location is lacking. We always come here when visiting my brother because there aren't too many of these suckers up north. This location CONSTANTLY forgets menu items, or you find they've screwed up what you ask for upon arriving home. We make a point to pull into a parking spot, and check that the salad actually has grilled and not fried chicken, or that there's not a random piece of cheese on our chicken sandwich (um gross)! When you call to complain, they really don't care. They forgot my brother's fries once, and they rudely asked what they wanted him to do about it. Let's start with your job!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite chick-fil-a's. You would expect to find this quality in South Park but no, it's on albemarle! Service is extremely friendly and usually fast considering how much business they have. The chicken is always really hot, the fries could be a little hotter. Breakfast here is good except there is no breakfast platter options as far as I can tell."}
{"text":"Great service, ALWAYS! Great food, ALWAYS! Just leaving work and wanted a late night snack, got the grilled chicken. Yum!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service is always excellent!! The ice cream cone is really good value!! Drive through line was ridiculous though, so we ate inside :-)"}
{"text":"Always awesome - super Drive Thru service with a smile. I love the location right off 485 - great if you're running late from work in the evening!!"}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-A. Great food, staff is amazing, clean and always fast service. They have the BEST Vanilla Iced Coffee! Cold pressed coffee, fair trade."}
{"text":"Love me some Chick!!! This location is just as good as the rest! I love that they bring the food to you, makes it feel like a restaurant. Everyone that works there is super sweet, too."}
{"text":"I love Chick, so really they can never go wrong in my book. This location, like every other chick, is great! Fast and super friendly service, delicious food, it's all I need! The one thing I will say, the parking lot can be a little scary! I know you want your Chick (or Trader Joes with is another love of mine), but you're gonna have to slow down and take it easy!"}
{"text":"Throughout history we have been plagued by deep philosophical questions: Why do you always want what you can't have? Why did the chicken cross the road? And why does the craving for Chick-fil-A hit on Sunday? 

No matter. Chick-fil-A is good any day of the week! 

Making it through to Monday for the deep-fried in peanut oil cravings to subside is well worth it just to indulge in those waffle fries once again. 

And the sauces: Buttermilk Ranch, Honey Mustard, Chick-fil-A Sauce, Honey Roasted BBQ, Polynesian. What is in those sauces that makes them taste so good? No, seriously, what is in them? Does anyone have a recipe that even comes close? 'Cause today is Sunday."}
{"text":"Great food of course, but the efficiency and friendliness of the drive thru staff are especially noteworthy. I try to quickly swing by this location once a week and have never been disappointed. The flow through the drive thru is fairly quick.  Also after just a first few visits, Precious learned my name and has done a great job remembering it each time since.  She is always friendly and helpful in spite of the conditions (i.e. AZ heat). And though the interactions are brief, her consistent friendliness plays a significant part my return each week."}
{"text":"I can't understand how this place has a four star average, today was my first time at this location and the cashier and all others that I spoke with were the most polite, well dressed and friendly staff I've ever seen at a so called fast food restaurant.

Never mind the good food and impeccably clean store, I'll be going back just to see the fantastic crew working there, what a pleasure. 

These individuals have obviously been highly trained and it shows, thank you Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwiches and fries. Best lemonade in town. Politics aside, one mean chicken sandwich thats hard to beat. Some of the best customer service in the industry. Great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've just returned to AZ after a long period of time in Seattle where there are no Chick-fil-a's. While I don't exactly agree with some of their corporate philosophies, including the whole silly closed on Sundays things, I still find myself craving that #4 spicy chicken combo.. 

Did you know you can order your sandwich bun-less and have them wrap it up in lettuce for you? It's certainly messier, but just as delicious.

And I LOVE chick-fil-a sauce.. I swear they put crack in that stuff.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I can also recommend the honey mustard sauce even though its a tad too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 spicy sandwich meals.. with fries well done. Asked for ranch, Polynesian, chick fil a sauce & ketchup.. got none of them. Got a cherry coke and a regular coke... got a cherry coke and a Dr Pepper. Not only that but the chick at the window literally threw the bag in our faces and was rude as hell. I love all of my chick fil a experience but this one was absolutely terrible. Will never go to this chick fil a again!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the course of one week.  First, the food - Thumbs up to the Chicken Tenders and Sandwiches.  In general, stay clear of the Nuggets.  Tastes processed and compressed, even though they claim not to be.  Yummy Polynesian sauce! Second, the staff - WONDERFUL! Always went through the drive through, and when we had to wait for items not ready, they were accommodating and gave me a free Chick-Fil-A cow toy!  Had wanted one and didn't know it even existed!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by chick fil a after getting surgery since I wasn't allowed to eat all day and night. Purchased a combo meal & they forget my waffle fries. What kind of combo is It when an employee forgets to bag your fries along with your meal. I'm only leaving 1 star because this has happened more than once."}
{"text":"The best service in fast food restaurants!!! I just love the way they say \"my pleasure\" after you say thank you ;) i alway order the spicy chicken Deluxe sandwich along with a cookies and cream milkshake ummh mm!!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and service is not bad, but a bunch of homeless crack heads sitting around eating ketchup & sauce packets..."}
{"text":"Finally decided to check out this place, it remains busy since opening.  Only a few people in line, server was friendly.  Ordered spicy deluxe burger, strips and nuggets.  Order was delivered to our table shortly afterwards.  Waffle fries were hot and delicious.  Strips and nuggets although tasty were dry as heck, don't understand how they are so dry when they are super busy?  How much had the keeping warm?
Nice dining room attendant guy offered us drink refills which was nice.  Finally had the spicy burger, again chicken was dry and coating was soggy from lettuce and tomato.
Won't be in a rush to return."}
{"text":"I really do not like this CFA.  I just come to this location bc it is close to me.  I have to tell you, that they can NOT make lemonade. It is the norm for it to be FULL of pulp, making it not very drinkable.  This was my 3rd time here, and my last.  I also think that the customer service is not really that great.  Just tonight, they had a sign up about no longer selling certain salad dressings, and such.  I asked the lady at the window why did they stop (the one wearing eyeglasses)....she looks at me and said I have no idea! Do you guys not talk to each other? Oh, i did not know! The 1st word that came to mind was clueless.  Clueless bc she said she did not know, and seemed to not care.  I was also clueless referring to myself as to why I keep coming here. I am sure I will have a nightmare about all the pulp in my lemonade that I could not drink, lol! It was so gross.  I can tell you that this location does not live up to the CFA standard.  Please educate your staff, on customer service.  I do hope things improve. I will not be around to find out...I am so done here.  I really feel sorry for your victims."}
{"text":"Extremely slow. 22 minutes for a chicken sandwich with only 7 people in front of me. It appeared chick-fil-a staff was giving away food to other airport staff as I waited."}
{"text":"This morning I came into this Chick-fil-a, and placed my first catering order. The staff was very accommodating and respectful of my time. Especially the Manager Samantha. She advised me on the appropriate amount of food needed for my excepted group to feed, and set great expectations about the time needed to complete my order. Luckily I was able to use the WiFi that Chick-fil-a offers (A Great Thing) to complete some work while I waited. Even in a clear unexpected rush of customers around 10:00 am my order was complete in the expected time, and exceeded my expectations. Thank you Samantha and also to you Debbie for your kindness and helping carry my order to my car. Great job Management and Staff! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The only Chick Fil A in NY is hidden in an NYU dorm, and let's face it, I don't have time to sneak into dorms, so I only get Chick-Fil-A when I travel.  How do they make the sandwiches so good?  Why are their waffle fries so delicious?  Why can't I have their oreo shakes all the time?  I love love this place."}
{"text":"Most inefficient Chick-fil-A drive thru I've gone through. They do the orders on the iPad, but you still have to wait to pay with a card at the window, further slowing down the line. In addition you can't make any special requests on the iPad, I had to wait until I got to the window. I usually use the app to order mobile to go if the line is long, but this location only has carry out instead of the ability to do curbside. Review is on the location not the food, especially because getting out of there was hectic as well. My only complaint with the food was that my ice cream cone was broken in half, so as that ice cream melted it began to leak everywhere"}
{"text":"Food was great, nice and warm. Service was really fast and I was super impressed considering it's the grand opening. The line looked insane but it was only a 25 minute wait. Also the employees were super nice. Overall 10/10."}
{"text":"CHICK-FIL-A SAUCE is the SHIZZZZZ nazz

** 2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #8 **
.
I have been waiting & waiting for this location to open as I kept driving by & wanting every 3 times I made my way to physical therapy on Charleston. This location is like PRIME location for sure.  The inside is neat & clean as I expected & they even have little live carnation flower center pieces which is cute! The drive threw ALWAYS seems packed so I just go inside & order.
.
The staff are super nice. There's this one guy that always helps me & he is SUPER fast & knows his stuff. 
.
I always get the 30 count nuggets which are only $15.99 & you get 8 sauces w/ it which is literally the main reason I freaken CRAVE this place so much!!! 

The frozen strawberry lemonade is AWSOME on a nice Hot summer day in vegas while it is still tangy but creamy too. Something about it is addicting! 
.
This might not be as good to everyone as it is to me but honestly this place beats all the fast foods in vegas especially since it is a sense healthier since its not all thick battered chicken. 
My growing up w/ this place back in CALI may take in some consideration to my obsession! =]"}
{"text":"I  a regular to this restaurant and I come here about 2-3 times a week and for the most pet never had any problems. The main time I come is on my 30 minute lunch since I work across the street. Tidy I went to the walk up window to order my food because they are usually quick there and was told to go inside and when I went inside to place my order I waited over 15 mins to be address not sure they they were short staffed or not but they almost made me late back to work. And they had one person at the front letting the line grow. Never again will I come back"}
{"text":"Politics notwithstanding, we decided to hit Chick-Fil-A as a Black Friday breakfast before going to the stores. It was pretty great. We each got cups of coffee; she got a chicken biscuit, and I for a bacon, egg & cheese. My food took a little longer, which I didn't understand, but I suppose it was a bit busy in there. She said hers kind of fell apart, and she was keeping it together with ketchup. My biscuit was very solid and tasted quite good. The bacon was thick and plentiful, and the egg was fluffy without disintegrating. The coffee in both cases was piping hot, and I burned my tongue on first taste, but it made for good road sips. The staff was wonderfully accommodating, as usual and as always."}
{"text":"Consistent as always. Play place was clean. Ketchup packets very organized.  Survey on back of receipt should be accessed via app too."}
{"text":"I visit this location at least bi-weekly and it never fails to receive superb customer service and quality food."}
{"text":"Took my 9yr old son there to get some chicken strips.  Surprised to see kids meal only contained 2 strips.  So I ordered the adult version 4 strip meal for him and myself.  Although tasty, I was appalled to find them to be so small.  Especially since they charge over $8 for the meal.  My 9yr old was still hungry afterwards.  Maybe they should spend less on advertising on put more into their value.  Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Accuracy on orders is an issue at this location. I have provided feedback to locations manager and I look forward on seeing improvements."}
{"text":"We try to visit a Chick-fil-A every time  we visit North Carolina! So of course after landing at 8:05am, we came here for breakfast!

We used their drive through and it was so pleasant. Their employees are always so welcoming and nice to talk to even in an early morning. I think that's one of the reasons we like Chick-fil-A in NC so much more. 

I think we all know their food is delicious. We had Chick-n-Minis (sweet and savory. So yum!) and a Chick-fil-A Chicken Biscuit. 

They also gave my dog a dog treat! Great food and service! I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Never give me my sauce when I ask I always have to go back around or just end up home with none. Also the African American girl name Dreamla in the morning on the head set is extremely rude and does not need to be the one taking orders.  She wants to get frustrated when you want your food the way you want it like I'm not paying a outrageous amount for fast food chicken.  Usually all chick fil a has great customer service this girl needs to go to McDonald's that's more her pace and attitude. Waited all that time pulled over to the side waiting for my three times well done nuggets just to get home and they are not at all close to well done."}
{"text":"A bit concerned when I saw the horrible health report that this is that wasn't got a few weeks back on the news. The establishment has very friendly staff the food seems to be really tasting good and its it has good values isn't establishment. I like the outside drive ordering system although   I really feel bad for those people standing outside and 105 degrees. Never anyone not smiling at drive thru. I love Chick-fil-A for their biscuits as they're really yummy in the morning. Their Peach shakes are also a seasonal welcome addition."}
{"text":"Well the grilled chicken salad with blueberries, strawberries, apples carrots, blue cheese crumbles, roasted nuts is fantastic.  I had the avocado lime ranch dressing which should be bottled and sold in stores, it is so good!   However, their new limited time mocha shake is not great.  Should have just gotten the lemonade.   I had to rate only 4 stars because of that shake."}
{"text":"I call this location MY Chick-Fil-A. The best one I have ever been to. Always EXTREMELY happy and friendly staff. And almost NO wait time even when there is a long line. These guys always got it under control !!"}
{"text":"Yum, not sure what there isn't to love about this place. Food is great and fresher than many other fast food places. The staff is friendly and always accommodating to my children and I. Yes, they get busy, but they are great at still getting you in and out."}
{"text":"This is the BEST chick fil a, yes they all have great customer service but I was blown away by the staff here. They went above and beyond to help me when I came in with my baby. The staff was friendly and got me everything I needed without asking, they apologized numerous times that it took my food a little longer than normal to come out and gave me a coupon o make up for it. After a little accident in the play area they promptly brought a band aid and a little stuffed animal to make the little one feel better, and enough for all the kids around so no one was left out. I feel like you don't even get his good of customer service sometimes at a high end restaurant. 

Moms this is such a kids friendly location and they were even rated the cleanest for germs. So impressed by everything, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Always love coming to chick fil a. Great French fries, and their nuggets are to die for. Try the chick fil a sauce with the fries. This location was slower than others I have been to, but was clean and the staff were friendly. I went three times in a four day trip here. Will be back for sure.

Update: came back at 11am on Saturday, and they told us they had no Mac and cheese and would not make any for us. Knocked down to three stars."}
{"text":"It's the best you could expect for a mall food court fried chicken sandwich place.  It's total chaos during lunch time, as lines for placing orders and picking up food often collide.  Good enough food."}
{"text":"Still horrible actually I think it's worse this time around, the fries taste like they've been marinating in peanut oil for 36 hours or more there's no delicious potato flavor they're not even salted it's just a soggy French fry that taste like cooking oil"}
{"text":"Best Chick Fil A ever, staff are very friendly and attentive, food is great, and they have their delicious variety of sauces out there for you and you can take as many!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and quick but this isn't the friendliest chick fil a I've ever been to. I feel the company has set the standard high in customer service so I have noticed that this one is sub par in that regard. Otherwise, the food is good and this one isn't too busy around lunch time."}
{"text":"Service staff gets the order wrong almost every time we order through drive through. Upon feedback to the manager, she showed no remorse nor did she took the ownership and was in fact condescending and rude. Rude but it was there pleasure as that's what they are programmed to say. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Employees treat the customers extremely poorly. Do not appreciate that on my lunch break. There is a corner bakery down the block, two subways, a pizza place, and a salad place all around if you need something quick and don't want to be treated rudely."}
{"text":"O, my favorite place to attend ... this is an every other Friday ritual treat for my 2 little who just loves the food and the indoors playground! Fresh, clean with friendly workers."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The line is long but it shortens, quickly ... this is the only fast food Resturant, I attend  ..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Chick-fil-A and glad to see they have finally come to Vegas.  Even though we are 2 weeks into the opening, the lines are outrageous both in the drive through and inside the store.  I do have to admit that their proactive approach with order takers meeting you in the line is smart and it seems to expedite the process.  I will say, there is an abundance of employees to accommodate the volume.  

So here's my beef. One of the 4 people in our party is Vegetarian.  I know....why would we be going to a chicken place???? So the question to the order taker was \"Do you have vegetarian options.?\"  The answer was \"we have lovely salads that can be prepared without the chicken.\"  Perfect! The order taker placed the order accordingly.  At the register I overheard a trainer tell another cashier that a salad was ordered without the chicken.  Didn't think anything of it until we received the salad completely dressed as normal including the chicken.  In addition, the requested salad dressing was wrong.  

Busy or not....and they were busy...staff members should take consideration to special requests as it is important to the consumer.  I believe the assumption on Chick-fil-a's part was the order taker input the order wrong, and then made the salad to spec.  Missed opportunity!  We did not have time to stay and rectify the problem however I did notify the staff member that delivered our food to us, and she apologized."}
{"text":"Tonight I returned to this particular business to allow them an opportunity to correct last weeks horrific meal.  I was surprised that no effort was made to make up for the nasty, dry, cold sandwich - even after I showed the picture.  I told the girl I didn't want another sandwich like this and showed her the photo.  She replied Ok and proceeded to take my order.  I eat at this place, correction - used to eat at this place at least once or twice per week (sometimes more) due to its proximity to work.  No more.  I will no longer support this location.  I guess my chicken needs will be met by Canes down the street."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. Chicken is always fresh a d the lemonade is like what grandma made. Wish they had it so i could get my own refills but what ever."}
{"text":"I love Chic-fil-a, delicious, consistent and best staff all around.

This is my default fast food."}
{"text":"This location of Chick-fil-A was convenient for our visit to downtown. The restaurant was doing a brisk dinner business at 6 PM Most of the tables were occupied
The order line was non existent and our order was placed immediately and delivered to the table fairly fast. The counter staff was helpful and friendly. 
We ordered a  Chick-fil-A  and spicy Chick-fil-A  deluxe sandwiches and an order of waffle fries. 

The sandwich breading was a perfect coating and the chicken very moist. The spicy sandwich comes with a slice a pepper jack cheese which adds some heat. Both sandwiches come with tomato, lettuce and pickles and makes for a tasty chicken sandwich. The fries were hot and not greasy or oily. Nice crunchy fries. I tried the Chick-fil-A sauce and I prefer the sandwich without the sauce. It had a slight smokey taste."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast I've waited 4 years for there to be a Chick Fil A here in Vegas.  Finalllllly!  I've been here 3 times since it's opened.  Each time I went through the drive thru.  Each time I think it's gotten progressively worse and slower.  

The first day I came was opening day.  They seemed to have the system down to a science it just took about an hour.  The 2nd time I came I asked for the BBQ sauce for the sandwich and they gave me regular BBQ sauce.  All the other chick fil a's know which sauce goes with the sandwich however today when I came back AGAIN an employee said \"there's actually no sauce that comes with the sandwich\".  Not impressive to say the least.  The staff used my name and it was great on the first trip.  On the 2nd trip they had it but didn't use it.  Why ask if you're not going to use it.  The wait the 2nd time was about 1/2 of what it was the first trip.

You'd think it would continue to get faster but the opposite happened today.  I waited OVER an hour in the drive through and it wasn't even a heavy meal period.  I arrived around 415 and just am leaving the drive thru now.

I haven't checked out the location on Stephanie but this location isn't up to my standards for Chick Fil A"}
{"text":"Finally a location in Calgary!! I have waited so long and highly recommend to others! I love the ice tea and chicken biscuit. Only downside is parking but if you're with someone you can park in the cell phone parking. Overall a great choice."}
{"text":"Fast drive through. Forgot my soup, so I called and the manager said they would send me a gift card for the inconvenience. Been three weeks and nothing. Would help if they gave me my receipt."}
{"text":"I have been around and heard of Chic Fil A all my life.. i have only eaten here 2 x since 2006. I soo forgot how good it is!!!!!! The drive thru was backed up further out than I have ever even seen at In an Put next door. I took a chance and waited in line.  There are 2 lines where a staff member were taking orders in each line.  I looked at the laminated menu, ordered and paid all right there. Then as I round the corner,  a young lady confirms my name and order, gives me a paper receipt, then around to pick up window.  They let me know it will be 3 minutes to get my drink as they ran out of syrup and need to change it out. Im like, nawww, no sense holding up the line, i will take diet instead. And off I went. Food was fresh and good."}
{"text":"Not only is the food always on point,  customer service is phenomenal, there's a young man by the name of Austin who works drive through  I work in the area so I'm here for breakfast and lunch quite often he is always pleasant and smiling and strikes up a conversation great addition to the team . Keep up the great work chick fila"}
{"text":"So yummy!!  Healthier than most fast foods.  They are also much cleaner.  I enjoy using their Chik-Fil-A sauce!  Make sure to try it!  They are super fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRID first experience. My fiance and I ordered online, picked up the order. They read off the order to him when he went to pick it up and everything sounded great. He got all the way home for us to find out they gave us the completely WRONG order. He drove all the way back to get the correct order and they forgot almost half of our sauces. Overall, I'll be back because sometimes I get chick-fil-a cravings but dear lord do I resent the heck out of this place.

I know you guys are busy, but I've worked in the fast food industry before and it's not that hard. Get it together."}
{"text":"Always the very best!  I'm so glad they opened in Palmdale.  From the first time I ate Chick-fil-A in Kentucky to Pennsylvania to Orange County, CA, it is always the best!"}
{"text":"Colleen has great hospitality.  She takes pride in her work.

My breakfast platter was delicious and my friend's sausage biscuit was delicious.

I love Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Love Chickfila! My family and I visit here once a week and always leave happy. They have quick, easy, and efficient service. And super nice staff members."}
{"text":"Always so friendly!! Prompt service  & have never gotten my order wrong. So glad they are so close to my house"}
{"text":"The food is always so good for chicken sandwiches! I'm so glad they're opening up more locations in the west coast. The customer service is so nice and amazing every time we come here.
The drive-thru lines are always so long so my boyfriend and I just come inside to eat. It's a much shorter wait and your food comes out almost immediately! The interior and atmosphere is so clean and nice! It's not like any other fast food restaurant and it doesn't feel like one either. 
Make sure to do the survey on the receipt so you can get a free chicken sandwich!!! So worth it."}
{"text":"So good! I've waited a year for one to open in Vegas and, viola! Never disappointed with the food and especially with my fav sauce & fries! Can't wait until the lines aren't crazy long but at least the employees are efficient with getting our orders in a timely manner. CHECK your food before leaving. Their new, human, and pretty busy so mistakes can happen. Catch it before you make the drive back home (should do that when dining out anyway)"}
{"text":"Yay!!! Chick-fil-A is now open in Vegas! Yee-haw! *kicks Raising Canes to the curb (lol jk)

My wife and I came to tonight's grand opening, and as expected, it was crazy busy. There were police on site managing the parking lot. The line for the drive thru probably extended all the way around Las Vegas from the looks of it. We decided to dine in, but of course, there was a line outside as well. Luckily, we didn't have to suffer for too long in the cold, and we were inside within 15-20 minutes. 

We ordered our usual. My wife got the deluxe chicken sandwich combo, while I got the spicy chicken deluxe sandwich combo. Initially, they brought out my order incorrectly, but one of the employees sincerely apologized and immediately brought the right one. My sandwich was perfect; the bread was nicely toasted, the chicken was juicy and tender, the jack cheese had melted right onto the chicken, and the tomato and lettuce were super fresh. The waffle fries were also really good and crispy. 

An important aspect of this food chain that really distinguishes itself from the other fast food chains is the customer service. With every Chick-fil-A I've been to, the service has been superb. Everyone is so nice and accommodating. The employees will always come around and check up on you if you need anything AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT. I have to give them 5 stars just for that alone. You can tell that their employees really take pride in representing such a successful company. They also close on Sundays to respect the Lord's day. Mad respect right there. 

I can't wait to get my chicken sandwich and waffle fries grub on anytime now! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Great service. Very fast and friendly staff.  Food is always served quick and hot and right the first time. Love coming here to get my chicken sandwich fix in.  The best fastest food place around in my opinion"}
{"text":"There still is a long line for the drive thru (walk ups too!) People are coming from all over Vegas to get their Chick fix! It's ridiculous people are giving poor reviews for the long lines which really is out of their control but know the drive thru moved quickly, was run efficiently with really nice patient employees (and there were a lot of them!) When you get close they give you a menu and take your order. Our food was fresh and piping hot especially the fries. I liked the food. The Chick Fil A Sandwich is kind of small but tasty. It was a simple fresh well seasoned chicken breast with pickles (you choose the sauce you want ) It was delicious and still warm by the time I got it home, it was in an insulated type bag. I ordered the chicken soup and it was pretty good with fresh chicken in it and it too was still hot by the time I got it home. I also ordered a side salad (instead of fries boohoo)it was fresh and decent for a side. My husband ordered the deluxe Chick Fil A which had lettuce, tomato, pickles and cheese and was a much bigger sandwich than what I had. It was served in a box. He said it was good. His waffle fries were fresh and piping hot and boy were they good; salty and flavorful but if  you are taking your fries to go or the chicken sandwich I had served in the insulated bag you might want to open the bag a bit so the hot food doesn't steam and get soggy.  I find myself doing this for all my takeout orders from any restaurant. Also, they have at least 8 sauces to choose from so take a peek at the sauces they offer online before you get on line to order. Looking forward to returning to try more on the menu especially the frosted coffee...ice cream and coffee YUM!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through, ordered a chicken deluxe meal with no tomato and no ice in the drink.

After several complications, I got the order in! Went to the window, they didn't note down the no tomato and no drink - no big deal, mistakes happen.

Guy taking my money asks the guy who took the order about the tomato and drink, and he pulls a face clearly bad mouthing me

Food good, prices high, service is generally good but some of the employees have a stinky attitude sometimes."}
{"text":"My favorite location. The whole team is genuinely so nice and friendly. Tonight Michelle was extra friendly, her kindness and willing to help immediately when my two year old spilt his drink made my long day 1,000 times better. She was super great with both of my kids. Thank you Michelle! You are a rockstar!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken but not for corporations who speak out on political or religious views.
You're a fortune 500 company. You make chicken sandwiches. Just make chicken sandwiches and keep your mouths closed and I'll keep coming for your chicken.
God knows if I was blessed with a fortune 500 food chain I would be on my own island speaking my beliefs to myself."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Saturday during lunch hour; it was busy as all get out, but I went inside anyway and ordered some food.  The cashier was a friendly dude, and the hustle and hectic bustle of the restaurant affected him not at all.  He even asked me if I wanted extra pickles on my sandwiches.  I did not have to ask for them; he asked me!  After I ordered, I went over to the condiment station.  Not two minutes passed when an employee stepped up behind me with my order.  As busy as the place was, I received my eats in less than two minutes!

I was taken aback by such quick and friendly service, but the courtesies didn't end there - when I walked around to find a table to eat at, the employee happily followed me to the table I selected.  Once I sat down, she placed my food before me and adroitly noticed that I had forgotten a straw.  As I got up to retrieve one, she said, \"No, sit down.  I'll get it for you.\"

Damn!

After I wolfed down my righteous feast, I headed back to my vehicle in the parking lot.  I looked over at the drive-thru line and noticed two employees out there taking orders from customers waiting in their cars.  They were obviously doing this in order to curtail the amount of time those customers had to wait.  \"Damn\", thought I, \"this Chick-fil-A is definitely the apogee of customer service!\"

What a great place, what a refreshing change!  You don't see this kind of service in any other fast-food restaurants; at least, I haven't."}
{"text":"First time actually eating at a Chick-fil-A, and I am a fan! The customer service far excited 90% of the service you get at other fast food places. 

There was a play area for the kids, which made everyone happy! The gilled chicken sandwich was tender and overall delicious. I am a little embarrassed that it took me so long to try this place. The only negative thing was that the kids chicken nuggets were kind of small, but that is probably because they are actually chicken unlike other places.

I look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"So I'm not a fast food person, but when I'm hungry & need a grab & go, Chick-fil-A is a, good healthier option.  The restaurant is clean, bright & busy. The cashier (Cheyenne) greeted me promptly & with a smile, when I approached the register to order. She took my order & filled my drink. I sat down & within a few minutes my food arrived at my table, warm & ready to eat. The food was also delivered to my table with a smile. All the table tops in the area I sat were clean & the booths were freshly wiped down. They have good (healthier) options on their menu such as their grilled meals & salads. They also have fresh brewed iced tea & fresh squeezed lemonade, if you choose to bypass soda (as I do). As I sat there writing my review, yet another smiley face approached my table to ask if I was finished, when told yes she cleared my tray. Thank you. Btw I love their honey/BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"My chicken was nothing like the United States Chick fil A if you're looking for Chick fil a flight down to the States it seems like they didn't even know how to cook chicken or no that is all signs are in English here in Canada."}
{"text":"I finally came, waited for the craziness to die down. These people are amazing!! Best staff ever in a fast food location. We were greeted , seated and served. They even checked on us 4 times to see if we needed anything, got our refills too. Very clean fast and friendly. A++++"}
{"text":"Love this Chick-Fil-A! Our son loves the play place and we all love the food! It's consistently good and fresh and the customer service is always on point. Spicy chicken sandwich is my go to and the waffle fries with chick-fil-a sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Chick-fil-A, but everyone is always so nice and I love it! It's a little pricier than most other fast food joints, but it's worth it. I almost always get the chicken nuggets, waffle fries and their fantastic lemonade."}
{"text":"This location has fantastic customer service! I just stopped by to pick up a large office order and they had my order ready to go in about 10 minutes! Over the phone, the gentleman took my order and labeled all the peoples name and bagged them separately which made it very convenient. When I got to the restaurant I was greeted kindly and talked to an employee who was extremely nice. Thank you for the outstanding service Chick-Fil-A!"}
{"text":"After hearing much about this gave it a try with the regular sandwich and a lemonade. The lemonade was very good. The chicken was a solid ok nothing special. Maybe the deluxe is better but not likely I'll wait in line again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times since they opened.  It's nice that they finally got off their religious high horse, and opened a few locations here.  They are extremely busy, but the drive thru works like an assembly line.  They have multiple people outside taking orders.  Then you pull up to someone who will take your money, and then you pull up to the window for your order.  The whole process takes about five minutes.  And the food is good for fast food.  The service is typical for Chick Fil-A, very kind and nice.  Now, if you plan on eating there, I would park in the shopping center next door.  Reason being is that the drive thru traffic is insane, and you could get blocked in or stuck in the traffic.  But it's typical for them.  Good food, great service. Still not pleased with some of the company's views though."}
{"text":"I literally go here all the time. Even tho it's little bit of a drive it's definitely worth it. Foods always fresh. Plus they've never messed my order up through the drive thru. Always has the sauce I ask for in the bag. Exactly what'd you should get for your money."}
{"text":"Customer service is ON POINT here. When the drive thru line looks like you will never get through it, there is someone standing outside with an iPad to take your order to keep the line moving quickly. They have everything ready and perfect when you get to the window and they greet you by name. Love their food and their service!"}
{"text":"Never can go wrong with chick fil a but they always give you one thing of chick fil a sauce till you ask for 3. That is the only problem with this one as well."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Its like the fast food thats not fast food. The food quality is great. Also have great healty choices. They always have the nicest staff members. Wish they had more on the east coast, but always a nice treat when you get away."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late bite earlier this week.  Was looking forward to the Asian salad. Lettuce was limp. Have had this salad at other locations before but this one not as crisp. Maybe they're not as busy and salad was a day old or so. I guess I'll drive a little farther and hit my usual spot, PV location."}
{"text":"Great staff. Very friendly and attentive. Tables that turn quick get cleaned just as quick. Nice! Their new salads are fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Ok so I never had this place before and I heard it was amazing. Well in my opinion it was not at all. It was all HYPE. Don't get me wrong the product is good. It's just NO DIFFERENT than any other chicken. Defiantly better than McDonald if that's a compliment.

The drive through took exactly 24 minutes for one sandwich. Totally wasn't worth a half hour of my life. The girls working the drive thru were amazing. Very sweet and polite and kept a 30 minute wait of cars very well organized. So kudos to the staff.

A huge NO-NO a member did was compare their sauce to Raising Canes sauce. That's one thing you don't do with competitors is compare your own product to theirs. In the long run Canes sauce is so much better but that shouldn't be said by staff.

I'm sure the hype will die down. But until then I have about 4 Canes here to choose from with the same quality food if not better and a lot shorter of a wait. 

Keep up the great work staff!!"}
{"text":"This location is always good. The drive through line is generally long but they know how to move it quickly.  The staff is friendly and always courteous and eager to please.  If there is ever an issue they resolve it quickly. I'm a fan of this location but I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience at any location."}
{"text":"I think I have been to two C-F-A's in my life, one in Chino Hills, CA and this one.

Even though I gave it 2 stars, I really want to say this: the staff were friendly and accommodating. The manager and employees were smiling and you felt a genuine desire to serve folks. Bathrooms were clean, tables, too.

So why the 2 stars? Well, ordered the soup and salad combo...sorry I don't know the name...but the portions were nice. However, when I opened the salad container, I found two pieced of cardboard. At first I thought it was tortilla chips. Then I looked very closely to confirm that it was cardboard. I took it to the counter, showing the manager. She too was shocked and very kindly asked if I wanted a refund or and exchange. I'm not mean person nor anal retentive. She was kind and genuine and gave me excellent customer service, so I just asked for an exchange. Happily she did so and I returned to my seat to finish it and my soup.

After I was about half way through with my soup, unfortunately, I began to feel kinda sick to my stomach, felt a little queazy and a bit dizzy. And then it passed...I chalked it up to perhaps there being a bit too much salt in the soup. 

But like I said, it passed and I finished both. My friend also finished her meal and we were both fine.

I might give them another try...not sure though.

And one last point: It took me about 10 minutes to find them in Yelp because they are listed under 'Chicken wings' and I don't think they sell one wing dish....very frustrating..."}
{"text":"The staff is always so friendly, this is the only fast food restaurant I take my son, and he loves it. The grilled chicken and power salad are our favorite! I love that he can also play in the indoor playground"}
{"text":"Don't know if this location has changed hands or what.  The quality is just not there any more.  Brown lettace and chic nuggets not crisp....nothing good anymore.  I used to get my grandchildren lunch at lease once a week and we find ourselves looking for other places to go....SAD!"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is A-OK!

The greatest thing about being back in the south, besides sweet tea, is the over abundance of Chick-Fil-A locations. C'mon they invented and perfected the southern style chicken sandwich/biscuit. As a chain, the quality is above average and lets face it waffle fries just rock!

This location is tucked away in the Stonecrest Plaza. It can be a little bit of a maze to find but it is all worth it. The food is what you expect from the CFA but the service at this location is top notch. The staff here will actually bring your order to you, ask you how your meal is, hand out free peach shake samples and take your tray to the trash. The staff here is super friendly it borders Stepford Wives nice! The staff here must really love their job. I guess I have become a bit jaded with my service experience over the years especially at fast food locations.

This location will make you want to \"Eat mor Chikin!\""}
{"text":"So disappointing the workers don't say \"my pleasure\" here. Food is still great, but I almost hate coming because of how terrible the customer service is here. I almost forget I'm at Chick-fil-A when I pull into the drive through waiting for my food."}
{"text":"My favorite location. Almost always see the same friendly faces for the last year. It's always kept clean, employees actively check in on those dining to see if anything is needed. Food always ready quickly. People very competent and always seem to have managers available. The playground is the perfect size surrounded by glass walls and door so you can see your kids but don't HAVE to hear them! The only complaint I have is playground was way too full one day with kids and ones that were way to big or old to be inside, I asked a nearby employee if there was anything that could be done and I was told they don't really do anything, it's up to parents. When I mentioned older children being in there she did then enter play ground area and ask them to exit. Which is why I still give 5 stars. I have 3 kids at ages 11, 8 and 2.... my older children do going to the playground with my toddler but no to be very conscious of the little children around them and not to act like crazy people in there. If my children were to miss behave in the playground or be rude to other kids they would be removed by me immediately."}
{"text":"This is first chick-fil-a that I've been to where my order took longer than normal. Been here only 1 time so far. The playground has a weird plastic chemical smell that gave my husband and I a headache if we stayed in there too long... not sure if they spilled a chemical cleaner in there? May want to check it out? We were concerned about our toddler playing for too long and inhaling whatever that was. We were there for a hour and didn't see them serve any tables? Usually they bring your order to your table for you but it looked like you could only take the food from counter to your table. Everyones food was in \"to go\" bags too? I ordered online sitting from table like I normally do and put notes in order that I am by the playground. ( I am at Chic-fil-a at least 3 times a week and have had no problems doing this at any other location) No one brought my order to me for such a long time...at least 20 minutes... i was starting to wonder if I messed up and ordered at the wrong location. Then someone called my name from the ordering counter for me to come up and get my order..... he brought food around counter and handed to me in \"to go\" bags and I had to ask where my drinks were? Maybe it was just a bad night? I didn't see any older people on staff either, just really young teenagers. Their food was the crunchiest I have had so far which was tasty. I'm sure we might try them again in the next few months and if I have a better experience then I will update the review."}
{"text":"Not worth one star!!!  I have a medical condition that does not allow me to eat fried foods.  Ordered the grilled chicken nuggets.  Drove 15 minutes back to work with almost no lunch time left and found that the idiots gave me Deep Fried chicken nuggets.  My fault for having to double check people who want $15 per hour.   Now no lunch for me."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here and we had to wait in the front for are food and everyone left and we were still there and at the end they told us they had ran out of chicken and they guy was like come back tomorrow for ur burger and to ask for Daniel and I was like what why and he was like we ran out and so we went inside to get are money back and wen we were in there the workers were getting food for them selfs and I was just like whatever because I'm not the type of person to make big deal but very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Amazing help. Amazing food always fresh and delicious. We are ecstatic you're in town.  Busy location but they are on their toes and you barely are waiting. So don't be scared if there's lines. Thank you chick-fil-A!!!"}
{"text":"Im convinced nobody on planet Earth is friendlier than a Chick-Fil-A employee. A couple days ago I went to Chick-Fil-A and asked for 3 chick-fil-a sauces, and 3 BBQ's with my order. They gave me 2 chick-fil-a and 3 BBQ sauces. Forgot one of my two straws. I didn't notice. I just assumed they got it right because it's Chick-Fil-A. So I drive off, and about 5 seconds later, I see a younger blonde kid SPRINTING to my car as fast as he could run. I stop. The kid apologizes and hands me a straw and chick-fil-a sauce. All while smiling.

Now I know the nuggets aint shit, (make spicy nuggets and tenders Chick-Fil-A). However, besides the nuggets, I'm a fan of everything else on the menu that's fried LMAO... And the customer service is second to none. I feel like if you stop smiling as a Chick-Fil-A employee for more than 10 seconds, the shift manager will fire you like Donald Trump, \"When I see that son of a bitch working and not smiling, I want to just fire their ass.. YOU'RE FIRED\"  Do they get a smile bonus quarterly? Seriously though, Chick-Fil-A employees are the friendliest people on Earth."}
{"text":"Great service, consistent, and never disappointing.  You can't get that from any other \"fast food\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A, and I love the Constitution and my First Amendment rights!  Best fast food in the mall!

The product is great... recommend the Spicy Chicken Sandwich!  The service is wonderful and the employees are kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe it's weird to review a \"fast food\" restaurant but I have to say they are just really the best.  I brought my 2 little girls here for a Valentine's lunch and it's not always easy being two-on-one with little kids.  From the second we walked up, someone was holding the door for us, gave my daughter a flower to give to me (sweet!), and literally every person we encountered was there to make it easier and more enjoyable.  Someone took my stuff and set up a table with high chairs for us, their team is always so friendly and seem to genuinely like their jobs.  My salad was good, the girls liked their kids meals, the play area was nice and clean.  I cannot complain one bit.  They really think of everything and it made my lunch so easy and enjoyable.  Thank you CFA! :)"}
{"text":"I loveeee this location not just because it's close to home  lol. The service is always on point even when the lines are seriously long. They have free WiFi so you can just pull out your phone and browse if your like me and want to save your data. Today the drive thru was actually not packed, they had the workers outside taking orders not sure why maybe the had a rush before I came but anywho the line moved quickly. I ordered the chicken sandwich combo and  everything was fresh and hot as always."}
{"text":"Love the product and really love the breakfast options. I dont love it when im one of three cars in line and when i get to the window and pay, I'm told I have to pull out of the drive through and park out front in the parking lot. Someone will bring my food to me. Huh? Are they bringing carhops bavk? Thats not what I wanted. Pretty sure I didn't order anything extravagant,  just a basic chicken sandwich. So I sit there for 15 minutes and watch car after car roll through the drive through and not one of them were forced to park out front. Eventually I had to go inside to complain. When I did I asked for a refund and no one seemed to care why I was asking for a refund. Manager never spoke with me, the cashier took my card and receipt and refunded my card. No apology whatsoever. Terrible customer service from start to finish. I would love for someone to respond to why I have to wait out front on the parking lot when I chose to use the drive through. Not holding my breath.  Too many other options to risk going back to this location. And for measure it was 1015 on a Tuesday.  Not exactly prime lunch rush crowd. Anyway, 30 minutes after pulling into order, I left empty handed, hungry and disappointed.  Panama bread next door will get my business now."}
{"text":"Alaina made our experience 100 times better than we expected. My coworker & I are from Los Angeles, we're here on a business trip & she treated us so well & was always very attentive!"}
{"text":"I work down the road, and I usually stop a couple times a month. This time was the worst. I pulled in around lunch time, and the drive thru was too long so I decided to go in. There was only a few people in line ahead of me and the line went by pretty quickly. 

When it was my turn to order, I did not feel the friendly customer service Chick-Fil-A is known for... anyways, I ordered for three people. The order came out in two bags and I ordered to drinks. I had to ask for a drink holder. And the employees did not even ask if I needed any sauces (that has never happened before). So I'm carrying my purse, two larger bags of food, and the drink carrier. 

When I get to work (I parked fairly close to the door) and I actually DROPPED my food on the floor because how is ONE people suppose to carry all of the food?! Why was I not offered a bigger bag? 

The customer service was obviously lacking, and I am disappointment in this store. I usually do not go inside (just drive thru), but it seems to me the employees do not have the welcoming and friendly attitude I have grown to love about the company."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which, unfortunately, they sometimes skimp on, in my opinion. 

I have to tell you, though, I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week, but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole \"kids eat free\" thing.) I was so mesmerized, as I waited in line to order and then for my food,  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And, their kids' meals have educational toys, often promoting literacy)."}
{"text":"omg!!! I asked for NO pickles on my sandwich and NO cheese on my salad... thus yall did whatever you wanted... tried calling your number listed but NO answer :( :( :("}
{"text":"Nothing crazy, normal, clean chic-fil-a. Chicken was nice and crispy. Forgot pickles on my sandwich tho. Overall I had a pleasant experience.."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey for not a lot or high quality food. I do love their sweet tea and milkshakes tho!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't what I expected food wasn't even that hot. Way to hyped up definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"They did a great job for a crazy day!
Very organized and the police helped!
Waited exactly an hour from start to finish in the drive thru.
Just as good as I remember....spicy chicken sandwiches and chicken salad sandwiches and chicken strips and waffle fries!!! Oh and the hidden gem is the chicken soup....a must for a cold night!
Only disappointment was they didn't have milk shakes or frozen lemonade but we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Mom and I were in the area and were excited to finally give Chick-fil-a a try. Yes, I know how people feel about them. Yes, I still chose to go there. 
I got the 8 piece nugget with fries and a lemonade. Mom got the regular chicken sandwich with a diet Coke. We got a frosted diet lemonade to share, and took home two spicy chicken sandwiches sans veggies for the hubs. 
Luckily, we came when they were busy. This sounds like an odd thing to be good, right? It was good that they were busy because it meant our food was super fresh. We actually had to let it cool down a bit. My nuggets were tender, moist, and the chick-fil-a sauce was delicious. I want to try some of their other sauce options. Mom said the same thing about her sandwich-really good, super fresh. Hubs also reported that he liked his sandwiches, though he had to get them after a 30 minute drive so he probably would have preferred them fresh. 
The waffle fries were awesome, but a bit on the salty side. One thing to note was that my Mom asked for fry sauce (it's an Idaho thing and she hoped they would have it) and the girl said yes and gave us ketchup lol. She probably thought we were bougie calling our ketchup \"fry sauce\". The lemonade and frosted lemonade were both good; oddly the frosted lemonade, which was diet, was super sweet on my first few sips, then I got used to it. 
The service was good; there are two drive thru lanes that converge, but they were busy enough to be out taking orders like In N Out does. The girl thought we would be ready to order right when we pulled off and seemed a bit bothered that we needed a menu and some time to think. I get that you're busy, but not everybody has been there before, so you have to have some patience. Overall it was a really good experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a free chicken sandwich. Big mistake. Cashier seemed new, didn't know what to do. She charged me for it and had to call a manager (I guess she was a manager. Personality of  rock) Manager printed out another receipt and gave it to new girl, who told me she added the charge back on my card. Two days later I still don't see a credit. I asked the cashier to just please give me back the 2.99 plus tax in cash and call it done, but she looked like a deer in the headlights. Geez, gotta drive back over there, go inside and talk to someone about a 2.99 refund. Frickin pain in the ass!"}
{"text":"slow, needs new management, can't handle rush hour workers, who are not too lazy to get out of their cars, only park and go in to order (even tho I have heard that is just as slow) if you are a jobless person, you'll never make it back to work on time"}
{"text":"Fantastic friendly service. the  kids there are so friendly and smiling. They have a system down to help customers in a speedy fashion. The food is good too, always fresh. I'm glad it came to Henderson."}
{"text":"First time eating Chick-fil-A.  My friend insisted I try it.  Have to admit that the chicken is very moist, the lettuce and tomatoes fresh and the bun soft.  My waffle fries were a bit too soft for my taste as I prefer my fries crispy."}
{"text":"I just don't get it...it's just chicken...maybe I'm missing something but it's just fried and grilled chicken sandwiches for A LOT more money than the other places that sell grilled and fried chicken sandwiches. Guess I just don't get it but was not impressed with the food I got. For $9, I'd rather go to a sit down restaurant! Meh..."}
{"text":"Service was FAST! Taste good too. Place was clean as well."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here with my family. Excellent customer service and the manager is an amazing person. They treat everyone with so much respect and you can tell they really value their customers and take pride in their work. Food is always fresh and they never hesitate to ensure their customers leave satisfied. I appreciate all of the employees and their hard work!"}
{"text":"Just about every time I go to Chick fil a I am very satisfied. Good was delicious as always and staff were polite and helpful."}
{"text":"A new job has me working on this side of town now and I must say, this Chick-fil-a is pretty impressive. Supposedly, they underwent a renovation recently so the layout is slightly different from others. The ordering station is much larger and once you've given your order, they give you a container (filled with any sauces, if you'd like) and instruct you to pick your seat because they bring your food directly to you. *insert praise hands emoji here*

I was here during the peak lunch hour (about 12:15ish) and it was busy but the line moved quickly. However the parking lot is a cluster so pack your patience and drive carefully!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff at this location! I frequent this location during lunch quite often due to its proximity to my office. The drive-thru is efficient but I find going inside to be even more efficient. There's ample seating but I find that they keep the A/C a tad too cold so I usually take my lunch on their outside patio. 

All of the normal CFA offerings are to be found. Even better, this location has deliciously tart diet lemonade which I cannot get enough of these days."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor to this CFA location due to its proximity to my job. This place can get to be quite bustling at times but service is always friendly and prompt.

They keep the inside clean but be warned that kids can overtake the place due to the ball pit. Don't be surprised that, during the day, the back half of the place is overcome with stay-at-home moms and their accompanying belongings and food."}
{"text":"I have been to at least 4 different Chick-fil-A's since i moved to Arizona and this location in Deer Valley is by far the best. First of all it is right across the street from where i work and they are always giving away free food...via your receipt or sending out discount coupons. They make the best chicken sandwich on earth...i am not kidding. It is the first real chicken breast sandwich i ever seen served at a fast food restaurant. It is a little more expensive than your average chicken sandwich but it is definitely worth it. It is not open on Sunday's because it is a Christian Franchise so they let their employee's have Sunday's off. 

This particular location has great customer service...fast service...it is extremely clean and all the food is great no matter what you choose. The dessert is not half bad either...so if you ever want the best chicken sandwich you have ever had in your life please go to Chick-fil-A. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Compared to the one in Deer Valley where I work.....this one needs some serious improvements. I know Chick-Fil-A takes it's customer service....food....and store cleanliness very serious. This one however is the exception especially when it comes to cleanliness and organization. This locale is always messy....the condiments are always disorganized....and the lemonade on my last 3 occasions has not been good..... for lack of a better word. I am shocked and appalled really because I have been to several of these establishments and if the managers there could see this store they would be shocked as well. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends.....just not at this Chick-Fil-A."}
{"text":"Is there a pickle shortage at this restaurant?  This is the FOURTH time I've asked for extra pickles and have gotten 2 total!  I spent $27.00 on food, I had to repeat everything over three times because the drive up window lady wasn't listening, ok fine, frustrating yes, it's fast food.  I pull away and look at my sandwich which even has EXTRA PICKLES printed on the label, and I have a total of TWO.  I go inside and say I want extra pickles, I give them a number: 8.  I get my sandwich, go to the car and there is a total of FOUR pickles on my sandwich.  I go through the drive through to return this stupid sandwich and am asked if I just want a side of pickles, I said I didn't see the difference between a side and putting them on the sandwich to begin with, but as long as I get more than two.  I got 3.  Advice-when someone is spending 30.00 for fast food, can you just give them what they ask for?  The place is clean, but every drive through experience we've had has resulted in at least one wrong item; go inside for accuracy, although even that is a crapshoot."}
{"text":"The service at this Chick-fil-A was fine.  Everyone was nice, the order was filled correctly and timely, and the store was clean - including the bathroom.

But the food itself was blech.  I think it tasted as it should, and I think it was fresh.  I just don't like the flavor.  I got a grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken and bun has an odd taste to me.  I probably should have just gotten the fried chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Like any Chick-fil-A, the food is always good. Went in for breakfast while on a cross country trip and as soon as I saw the sign.. I knew i had to get breakfast. My order was messed up by the young girl working the counter,, but no issues.. she was right out with a new one..

Fast food with restaurant style service.."}
{"text":"I have been severely disappointed the last half dozen times I've eared there.  The food quality has fallen drastically.  The management comes across rude.  I thought blown off.   Old hard french fries over season or under season chicken  I miss the days when you could just  get consistently good food."}
{"text":"Had lunch with the family and was good as always! HOWEVER, noticed that the \"bus boy\" on duty was only wiping the dirty tables with a paper napkin. Obviously isn't the correct way to do things! This is very unsanitary.."}
{"text":"Best place to grab a quick bite at the airport. Yes the airport is busy and there is a line (that should tell you it's good!!) It's  SO WORTH THE WAIT! Often times I'm there at 6am or earlier to catch a flight and those workers are always smiling and friendly.... I LOVE that. Life is too hard already to deal with grumpy people lol!
THANK YOU to all you hard working people - I appreciate you and what you do"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chick-fil-a. During peak times there can be a bit of a line, but they move through it pretty quickly. Their morning staff seems to be the best. I've watched them interact with their dine-in customers in the morning and they're awesome. The food great!"}
{"text":"Every time you walk in or hit the drive through you get \"It's a great day for Chick-Fil-A, how can I help you?\".  I feel welcomed :)

The other cool random thing... if I go through the drive through with my dog, they always ask if they can give her a milkbone... so she's a fan! just sayin.

As far as the food... I love this place - I mean I am the Duke on the iphone app... there all the time it seems.  Chicken is clean and not fatty, always juicy and the breading is never too thick. Extra pickles is never an issue and getting American cheese on it is cool too. Normal or Spicy Chicken is my pick.

My only beef w/ Chick-Fil-A is they're not open on Sundays... mormon thing. But whatcha gonna do?"}
{"text":"Today I stopped by chick-fil-a before heading to class at ASU. I noticed after ordering that I had forgotten my wallet at home. I was super embarrassed, so I told the nice guy working the drive-thru (I think his name was Daniel) to go ahead and cancel my order and that I apologized. He kindly asked me to wait and see if there was something they could do. I proceeded to pull out of the line so I could get out of the way and parked. Next thing I know, a nice woman comes to my car with my order and said they took care of it. It's customer service like this that keeps people coming back. I was stunned and will absolutely continue giving chick-fil-a my (payed) business. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Chick Fil A ever since I first tried it in Arizona. My favorite thing to get is their spicy chicken sandwich along with their sweet tea. As always, customer service is super friendly and sweet. 

Despite their busyness, they always do their best to serve you as quick as possible and have your meal out to you in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Good chicken. Good fries. Great service. Parking lot is a mess but inside the restaurant is neat and clean."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Eastern. So much hype around this place which took them over an hour at the drive thru MONTHS after grand opening. Luckily, the one in this location was only a 10 minute process at the drive thru despite the long lines and it's way closer to my house."}
{"text":"My experience today was probably the worst experience I've had with chick-fil-a thus far! It started off by the young man who took our order through drive through, we had to repeat ourselves multiple times. Then, usually they ask you what sauces you want before you finalize the order and they didn't ask. So we thought, that's fine we'll ask at the window. Or they'll ask us, how they usually do it. The lady at the window was named Jordynn, she gave us our food & she had attitude right off the back. When she failed to ask what sauces we wanted, we asked her for some and we had our bag of food in the car with us already so we thought she would just hand it to us, but no. She literally threw the sauces from the window to the bag that was inside the car. That was very rude and not okay by chick-fil-a's standards I'm sure of it. I've always had nice pleasant people at any chick-fil-a. Not this one. Probably won't return to this location again."}
{"text":"I can't express enough how much I enjoy Chick-fil-a and the Spicy Chicken Deluxe sandwich with waffle fries and a bajillion sides of Chick-fil-a sauce. That's the king of combos and I've gotta admit, the day Chick-fil-a came to Vegas was a happy one for me. The location on Eastern (ever since quieting down a bit after the grand opening hype) has been my go-to. The service is consistently up to the CFA standard! I've been to several other CFAs and I always expect the same great service at each and every one that I go to. This one hasn't let me down. The food is up to the standard that I expect from CFA, too! If you haven't tried it, give it a shot. If you have had CFA before, then this exactly the same as what you know to love and expect!"}
{"text":"As usual, great location.  Very neat, clean and organized.  Treated my son here this afternoon after doing some work.  Food was nice and hot and staff was always fast and friendly. 

Every engagement I saw here between staff and customer was right on point.  Great establishment."}
{"text":"The food is heavenly, I dream of the waffle fries with Chick Fil A sauce & Polynesian sauce. 

The service is fast, the customer service is top notch, and the food is soooooo clucking good! Hehe. I love the fact they have two drive through lanes where you order. It speeds things up and gets us our snacks quickly! 

Not sure why only 3.5 stars. Give it a shot! And the prices are reasonable considering the quality really is up there! So happy to have them here in Sin City!"}
{"text":"Wow, the #4 here is better than I have had in Virginia or California. I actually tasted spicy chicken; the spiciness wasn't muted at all. The chicken was also really crispy. This really hit the spot and was conveniently located near the A and B concourses."}
{"text":"today we went for my husbands birthday because he loves chickafila breakfast. We ordered chicken egg and cheese bagel and a biscuit. My husbands biscuit was dry, and the chicken was barely fried and the size of a chicken nugget. He also didn't receive egg or cheese on his. We were in a hurry and it was packed for an event they were having. My chicken was the same, very thin, and small. My egg was thin and small. I love chickafila and I still do I just wish they were a little more consistent with they're meals. One day you have a good meal worth your money, and the next day you're disappointed."}
{"text":"I may or may not have been late to work because I just had to make a morning stop at Chik-fil-A...

I have a thing for spicy fried chicken (I blame Popeye's), and this craving led to me searching the web for a place that services spicy fried chicken on a biscuit sandwiches. Lord have mercy! I kid you not I went to Chick-fil-A THREE times in one week so I could get their Spicy Chicken Biscuit breakfast sandwich it was that good! Ask for a packet of honey and spread that all over your sandwich and you will be in heaven! You can get a combo meal with an OJ and a box of never ending round hash browns for under $6. Do it! 

Five stars because that sandwich is damn good and I've had no problem with the drive-thru service."}
{"text":"This location rocks.  My wife and I go in a couple times a month for lunch during week.  Even when the place is packed they still give awesome service and food.  While enjoying lunch a gentleman who worked there asked to refill our drinks and take away garbage.  Doesn't matter how busy it may look its always worth the wait."}
{"text":"The dead flowers made my meal sad............................................................."}
{"text":"I personally am a huge fan of Chick Fil A... if I have to have some sort of fast food, this would be my choice hands down.  What makes this location a go to one for me?  The staff seems to be one of the most courteous and helpful (although this is the case with the brand in general).  I often place catering orders here and the staff always goes above and beyond making sure everything is perfect.  Keep up the great work!  

PS- they have a great rewards program if you have a lot of catering needs :)"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Chick-Fil-A.... even when I pad my times and give them an extra 15-30 minutes, somehow my stuff is never ready or right for my catering orders.  I never have this problem anywhere else."}
{"text":"Chic Fil A always comes in clutch. My usual is a 12pc nugget meal with fruit punch and lemonade split to drink. The bbq sauce is great and the Polynesian sauce is even better. I wished they served breakfast all day because they're biscuits and hash browns are both fantastic! Waffle fries are super fun too haha"}
{"text":"everything was great way impressed cashier was extremely helpful only reason im not giving five stars is cause she had a hickie on her neck...thats sooo groooose please tell your man to not leave hater marks"}
{"text":"I leave disgruntled after every visit to this location. The service is sub-par for a Chick-fil-a and I always experience a long wait. My last visit, the team member acted like taking my order was an inconvenience.  Definitely didn't get a \"my pleasure\" from her. I really hope this Chick-fil-A improves, especially since it is the closest location to my home."}
{"text":"Decent Chick-fil-A location. Close to Mill Avenue. Right across from the parking garage.

Environment:
Well-maintained and clean. Pretty spacious. A lot of seating. The restroom does have the door code, code is on the receipt at the bottom. Rest room is clean.

Price is the same across all Chick-fil-A.
The spicy chicken sandwich Deluxe was fresh and super good as always. Fry's were good as well and had the right amount of salt.

The cashier and waitress and waiters were all super friendly and attentive. She did forget my barbecue sauce upon delivering the order to the table, but she was quick to bring some back after I told her.

Good place to eat up before heading down Mill Avenue.

Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went there around lunchtime.
Pleasantly surprised that it was not too long of a wait. There was a long drive thru line but they have several workers outside taking orders and being efficient. I dined in. No line essentially on walking in. Service was fast. Food was fresh and hot. Fries were a crisp And just the right amount of salt. 

The waitress inside are really attentive and quick with your request.
Super nice people.

Would visit again for lunch time, 12 p.m."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated. Small sandwich did not do it for me. 
The staff is all children with confused looks.
I'll never understand the hoopla."}
{"text":"Since my broheim was kind enough to enter this CF location, I guess I should write the review I would have yeaterday but was too lazy/busy to add it. 

I love this place. The place is clean, friendly, quick and good. 
They had a manager out in the front of the registers directing traffic, answering questions, making sure everyones food was quick etc. RIGHT ON

The only bad thing is the playland. I swear some kids will loose a finger in the door. 

Try the Buffalo Sauce on the chicken.... delish!"}
{"text":"Two stars because customer service is great! But food isn't quite what my family expected. Thanks we will stick to raising canes!."}
{"text":"I wish everyone attended their customer service class. Always greeted with a smile and very professional. 

Oh and the absolute best fast food chicken hands down."}
{"text":"I have to say this is ridiculous the food I got here today. I paid $7 for basically nothing!!! I am beyond disappointed for what I received. It will be 2 notes and I am done!! How can you even think this is ok??? I asked for no bread and no cheese and still paid $7"}
{"text":"Food is always great when I go here but today the customer service was not up to par. My favorite part about coming to chick-fil-A is hearing them say my pleasure, and I said thank you multiple times  and not once did she acknowledge me. I am sad to say I will not be coming back to this location.."}
{"text":"Love their chicken sandwich. The fries are amazing too! Friendly service. I support them all the way."}
{"text":"One of the highest volume Chicks in the known universe, they move like a well-oiled machine. Not even the Stonecrest parking lot designed by M.C. Escher can put a dent in their ops."}
{"text":"Seriously? Why all the five star reviews? 
Judging from that and the long lines, you'd think it was some fast food offshoot of the French Laundry or something. Something. Anything. 
What it is is an ok  place for a chicken sandwich or fingers and not much else. If someone in your party wants a burger or something, go elsewhere. The service is quite fast, considering the lines ( again, WHY?), and the quality is ok if the selection is quite limited. For this, and the cleanliness, which might be attributed to its newness, I'll give 3 stars instead of two. But it's really just ok, and I fear that too many Yelpers have drunk the kool aid. Or just have low expectations in general."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch from time to time because it is close to work. 

If you have little kids, you will love this Chick-Fil-A. If you don't, it will annoy the hell out of you. Guess which category I'm in?

It's like trying to order food inside of a daycare center. The little kids scream and run around continually with their balloons. I expected to start hearing some sing-song rhymes and jump-rope chants. This would be fine on its own, but the staff seem to cater to the kids at the expense of everyone else. Today the line was stopped so that a red balloon could be located. \"She really wanted to have a red balloon, not a yellow one.\" Too damn bad!

I can't complain about the food, it's consistently good. It's just a frickin' headache to get food here."}
{"text":"Great customer service is a standard at chick fil a. I'm always surprised at the level of friendliness I receive (even though I frequent here!) 

To Management: Keep up the good training. Make sure to value your employees because they are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Didn't do it for me. After all the hype, I was pretty disappointed to get such mediocre food... I guess other people like it, but personally I feel like it wasn't worth the wait at all"}
{"text":"Well What can I say, the chicken is fresh and great. All workers are so friendly and nice. I hate the traffic for drive thru but I guess it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The service is outstanding!  The employees are friendly and make sure that you have what you need or they will get it for you. The food quality is very good for fast food.  The restaurant is very clean.   I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Asked for no cherry and a large soup. Got a small soup and a cherry. Thanks for caring about food allergies chick fil a"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food! Reynolds took my order, provided great information and really helped me get the quality service and order I'd expect from my favorite fast food chain. Keep it up! I'll go to any location available as well because its so good!"}
{"text":"Had a cold biscuit beacon and egg from this location, and let's not talk about the coffee that was Luke warm and tasted like it was made from yesterday's dish water.  The staff did not care that the food was being served in the danger void for food born illness.  Should have went to Cinnabon instead, as their rolls were just out of the oven and the coffee was steaming!  Why people are in love this this chain is a good question."}
{"text":"My first and last time I'm visiting this location. They have a process with the drive through to get people in and out as quickly as possible. But they fail to do a quality check when they hand the customer their food, especially through the drive thru. When I say quality, it's more like quantity. It's very upsetting when you get back to work and hand out the food and one of the four main items is missing. I was not about to drive back and wait in line to start the process over. I get it, new location, new staff but there are standards and I bet I am not the only one that this has happened to."}
{"text":"Best fast food restaurant in Monroe.  Wonderful attentive staff and managers.  Always clean.  Food is fresh and hot.  They always have a smile and a kind word.  

A clean family environment."}
{"text":"As I pull up in the two-lane drive thru I notice that on the left people are ordering through the intercom while on my right is a live person. I opt for the right for no particular reason. Three cars have gone past on the left and in front of me is what looks like a long-winded conversation between the employee and person in the driver's seat of the car. While I am a huge fan of human interaction and good customer service, it's about ten o'clock pm and I just want my chicken strips that are as soft as buttah. I'm also thinking to myself that I just don't want to wait in line as the employee gives her doctoral dissertation.

Finally I make it up to her and I immediately feel guilty for being so impatient. This girl is chipper, sweet and polite. After taking my order, she clearly deserves five stars for being so nice and having to deal with the public. I drive up and give my money to another chipper employee who calls me by my first name. Nice touch. 

I drive up to the food window and two more employees are chipper, prompt and both call me by my first name. Five-star drive-thru service game.

One star missing because the sweet tea was not sweet enough and tasted like water. Also this particular location does not carry coleslaw. I guess I am the only one who likes coleslaw with their fried chicken? I was SUPER pleased to try the super-food salad and so glad I opted for the large. My coleslaw disappointment immediately dissapated after trying this salad. I think they need to package the nutmix. I will buy it in bulk. Delicious. 

I really can't tell you what the hoopla is about Caine's. I prefer the chicken at Chic Fil A 100% more. It is much more tender and the sauce can't be beat! 

One of my friends won't eat with me at this restaurant due to her political stance towards the company. Super glad I get to live in a country where we all get to voice our opinions. My opinion is that this is one of the few companies left that have a dynamic positive culture that is shown through and through in the way it's employees interact with the public while also serving consistently good food."}
{"text":"I love this place! I drive over ten miles to this location because of its consistently friendly service. Honestly, every time I purchase food here, I become happier when I leave because of the positive atmosphere. I love how all workers seem like they really enjoy their job! The food is fantastic and I never have waited over 10 minutes for food, unlike some other locations who take much longer. I am very impressed with this location's overall restaurant management."}
{"text":"Food is always hot and the service is pretty quick! We went on a Saturday for lunch and it was busy but they have quick and efficient service down to a science. They had some extra stuff for the kids this particular day - cotton candy and popcorn (a circus theme).  Kids loved it! Also - Best Coca Colas around!"}
{"text":"I usually like Chick-fil-a, but my experiences at this one have been very lackluster. The food is usually moderately warm, and the french fries are okay, not great. It can get very busy, but there's a modest amount of seating so it's not a really big deal. I'd avoid this CFA and go to the one in Stonecrest instead."}
{"text":"A customer found a hair in his fries and showed them to the Manager.  The Manager did not apologize.  He just said he would get him a fresh order.  The Manager did not comp his meal either.  The cashier has braided hair long enough to touch the floor with nothing protecting the drinks or food she serves from her extensions.  This place is disgusting for a Chick-fil-a, and I will never return!  I will be notifying corporate of the poor hygiene, poor management, and disgusting food with hair in it!  This is not even close to Chick-fil-a's standards!  Avoid this location so you don't eat hair!"}
{"text":"Don't say I didn't warn you, the drive through situation here is a complete cluster fuck. Unfortunately this is not due to traffic but to this location's unsensical placement of traffic cones and order taking. The management at this location needs to take some lessons from In & Out and learn how to deal with volume. They are creating issues from nothing. One line becomes two and then one again, you have to speak to three different people just to get your order, Jesus Christ, it shouldn't be this hard. I just want to pick up a goddamn chicken sandwich and drive away. Fuuuuckk!"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii and hearing all the hype about Chick-fil-a I just had to try it. I honestly didn't think it would be all that but I was wrong. It was sooooo good! I got the #1 original chicken sandwich deluxe and it was super moist...best chicken sandwich I ever had. The fries were delicious as well. I dealt with 3 different people as we went through the drive-thru and each person greeted us with a smile and provided great customer service. I will definitely be back when I visit again."}
{"text":"Normal Chick-Fil-A and got pretty quick service. My only complain is this particular one like to dump the salt shaker on their fries. Had the saltest fries ever, they did remake them however my wife still had salty fries crammed at the bottom of her fry container that were redone"}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A location is wonderful!  We eat here about twice a month.  The food is great, the people who work there are all friendly, and the tables and restrooms are kept clean.  They have Family Wednesdays, usually with an entertainer of some sort and a deal on kids' meals.  There is also a small play area for kids and complimentary helium balloons near the registers.  My kids love getting to pick their balloon colors when we leave the restaurant.

Sometimes they have food coupons. I'm not sure if this will always be the case, but every time I eat inside the restaurant, they add a little flier to the food tray that has two food coupons:  One is usually an offer a free sandwich if you purchase a combo meal, and the other is usually for a free breakfast item if you visit during breakfast hours.  Awesome!  How many fast food places actually offer you free food coupons???  Also, sometimes during spring training season, the flier includes a discount on baseball tickets for the Padres and Mariners games at Peoria Sports Complex, which is practically next door just down the street on 83rd.  My family loves going to the games, and I really appreciate the coupon.

There are a couple of minor cons, but I don't really count them against the restaurant.   One is that it can be very busy and crowded at certain times...but with such great food and service, I know why the crowd is there!!!  Another con is that it's located in an awkward corner of the main plaza on 83rd Ave.  When it's rush hour, the traffic around the area can get very busy and can make it difficult to navigate in and out of the parking lot, especially if you're trying to get in from or out to 83rd Ave.

Overall, this is just a great place to eat and great for families.  I've been to many Chick-fil-A locations (having lived in Florida, Georgia, DC, and Pennsylvania) and this is probably the best location I've ever been to."}
{"text":"The food speaks for itself. Delicious. The staff here set the bar very high for high quality friendly service. If they see anything that needs attending to, or anyone who might need something, they act immediately. Move over In-N-Out. All the other fast food chains could learn a lot."}
{"text":"It's good fast food. Chicken minis are great for breakfast but need more then 4 to feel full."}
{"text":"This place is awesome very fast and fresh. Employees are very kind and my chicken sandwhich was delicious. There tea was very fresh and strong. The restuarnt is very clean and well kept. This location is great!!"}
{"text":"I just love Chick-fil-A, I have never had a bad experience. They made my food perfect. I love the chicken nuggets and the different chicken sandwiches. Excellent lemonade and iced tea. It's not hard to go wrong at Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the three fast food places I go to.

Best chicken nuggets and waffle fries

The lemonade is super good as well

I love the grilled chicken sandwich also
It is fresh all the time"}
{"text":"I was in town just for a couple days and my Boyfriend and I stopped in here for some familiar food. This Chick-Fil-A was very clean and the set up was nice. The staff were very friendly and easy to talk too. Even though we weren't in San Diego they made us feel comfortable and welcome. 

I really appreciated the great customer service and the great food. If we ever stop back in Arizona we will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I had never been to Chik Fil A before and my fiancé has had bad experiences in the past that has always kept us from trying the new ones in Vegas. After a long day out we were hungry and decided to give this location a go. We choose drive thru and from the time we pulled in until we pulled out with our food was a total of 3 minutes. Very fast prompt service and the food is great. Everything tasted great and I fell in love with the strawberry shake. My daughter got a kids meal with chicken nuggets and they were so good I'll probably get them for myself next time. Fiancé loved the Spicy chicken and my chicken club hit the spot, nothing extraordinary though."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a. Thanks for being decent and giving your employees a day off. Although, you've created a serious problem for me... I always want nuggets, waffle fries and Chik-fil-a sauce on that day... Oh well. Aside for that little problem, this location is great. The service is always spot-on and the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"My first time ever eating at a Chick Fil A. Yum yum and yum.

Tried the chicken nuggets, the tortilla soup, the waffle fries and a chocolate shake. I was extremely full. No, I did not eat it all. I did sample each of it and the shake was THE BEST PART! The nuggets aren't your mcdonalds nuggets. These are real nuggets of meat, not a byproduct and its all in the sauce. The chick fil a sauce was my favorite. Fast friendly service and a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken sandwich restaurant chains in the country. 
Great quality and service."}
{"text":"My uncle and I were at Chick-Fil-A last night around 7 p.m. and a kid named Jerry was working that went so above and beyond for a customer - that wasn't even us - that I had to write about it. 

A customer went through the drive thru and must have taken off before the employee working that night could give him all of his food. Noticing the problem, Jerry quickly volunteered to chase after them. The bag was small and couldn't have contained more than a container of fries, but Jerry sprinted after the car nearly a block. The driver didn't see him and he ran alongside the vehicle - that was moving fairly quickly for a parking lot mind you - until the driver finally saw him and came to a stop. 

I just wanted to share this amazing customer service story about a young man who did all he could to make sure a customer didn't feel ripped off at Chick-Fil-A. If I was a manager, I would find a way to recognize him big time!"}
{"text":"I fed my wife sooooo much Chick-fil-a when she was pregnant I think my daughter is 40% nugget. My family loves this place and they support law enforcement, which makes it a ten in my book."}
{"text":"Chickfila in downtown Phoenix, now that is what I am talking about!!!!! No more questions asking me where I got my nuggets and having to tell coworkers I brought them in from the west valley. I love Chickfila and this location is no different. Staff was super friendly, food was great as always, and the establishment was very clean. Only thing different with an express location was not ordering my standard #5. No meal # option which seems odd to me but there must be a reason for it. Looking forward to many lunch breaks here in the future."}
{"text":"I don't have Chick-Fil-A often but I've had it enough to get a sense of the consistency of the chain. Tonight's visit was good but flawed. Several of the waffle fries were SO fried that they were brittle. Even larger ones. Even the chicken for the sandwich was over-fried. Neither was enough to ruin the meal for me but when all you're supposed to serve is a really good chicken sandwich and famous waffle fries, you owe it to the chain to do it the way it should be done. 

Overall not a bad visit but not my best either."}
{"text":"It should come as no surprise that Chick-Fil-A makes a darn good chicken sandwich. And this location did a darn good job of it. The staff was welcoming and eager to serve while the manager didn't stop moving for a second keeping the restaurant clean and in order, even making sure that all chairs were properly and evenly situated under the tables. 

That attention to detail was apparent in the quality of the food and the customer service. Extremely well done. A model for other fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Always loved Chik Fil A but their locations were sparce. Good to have one here by ASU. The store looks really nice and modern!

Got some mailings in the mail for free breakfast sandwich and I came to check it out. It was awesome. Chicken was crispy and tender and the English muffin they used as a bun was so soft. 

If you like Chik Fil A, well, there's another location for you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Typical fast food place.

Food is great as usual because you can't go wrong with the chicken sandwich. The clerk was really nice too but not sure if he will be back next time.

I noticed that there is a playground there which meant lots of kids roaming about. It could be a good thing or a bad thing depending if you like kids.

Pretty clean but the one by Mill ave is cleaner and more modern and more decorated."}
{"text":"Best Chik Fila ever!   I've been to many...  This one has the best service I've ever seen, amazing staff"}
{"text":"Always great chicken here. This place is nice and clean, just sad that this area is bad that they have to give you the code to the bathroom on the receipt."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!  Will be back..someone trained everyone to the max...so clean and cared for.  Had the southwest chicken salad..yummy!"}
{"text":"I have never had a disappointing experience at chick-fil-a until today. They were fairly fast at the checkout but when I got my sandwich I had the tiniest piece of grilled chicken I have ever seen on a sandwich! It was way smaller than the bun. Another one with me got a chicken sandwich and hers was small as well. Not sure if its a new thing Chick fil A is doing or if it was just this store."}
{"text":"not sure how such rude person work at chick fil a, toady went there when it was my turn the guy was calling next without looking,i went and stand to order his phone was on the counter so he was texting  and without looking at me and trying to take the order ,so i told him he need to leave his phone alone and take my order he was mad , and he does not even speak english ,his english was so bad,,but the most important he was very rude , not sure if he related to the owner of this chick fil a , this guy look like a manger wearing blue shirt ,,,, what a looser"}
{"text":"Bought this side salad, almost done and this is what I find...a bug!! Ugh. This is the first time this has happened. Very disappointed and grossed out."}
{"text":"I don't come to Chik-Fil-A often but when I do, I always get the lemonade. It tastes so fresh and is the perfect drink for hot summer days. I had a friend tell me that this chain is actually the largest consumer of lemons in the world. That just speaks to how fresh the lemonade is!

And if you're feeling like you just need some good ol' fries, the waffle fries are to die for.

Service at this location is incredible with friendly faces to greet you and someone is always at the ready to pick up your tray when you're done eating. Truly an all around great experience."}
{"text":"Another 5 star review for a great place! I have been here a dozen or so times since they opened and as always the food is quick, perfect  and the staff is always so very nice. They even walk the floor and refill drinks if needed and always check on you. I am eating at a \"fast food\" joint but I feel like I'm in a real restaraunt. I've been to the North Olmsted location twice before and it doesn't feel the same as this location.

If you are a tea drinker the sweet tea is a must. I haven't tried breakfast yet but I like the addition of breakfast items and the sundaes and milk shakes, I will have to give those a shot soon."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-as are good wherever you go, but this one is the top of all of them! My family goes here so much they know us! Everyone is friendly and helpful. When I have my hands full with my kids, even if there is a line behind, I will be helped with my tray. Table refills, like at a full service sit down restaurant. I've never had a wrong order here like other fast food places. Community involvement abounds. Family nights and other special events. One time, my son had been in the hospital for almost a week, the morning after we got home, I ran out to cfa for breakfast as we all were still tired from the hospital stay, the employee, asked how my son was (they knew he'd been sick)and after telling her what all was going on with surgery and days at the hospital, our meal was comped and she told me sincerely to let her know if there was anything she could help with anytime. We are blessed to have such good experiences with our cfa!"}
{"text":"I was passing through and saw the strikingly different look of this chick-fil-a (CFA) and decided to make my food stop there. The entire staff was genuinely delightful and enthusiastic to help me. The food was delicious, the facilities were clean, and the atmosphere was inviting. I was able to hear from the owner/operator and he expressed a true passion for CFA, their mission, and helping the community via his CFA. I would recommend this CFA location to anyone interested in a tasty meal, excellent service, and management with a heart for community outreach."}
{"text":"You know what you're getting! That BBQ sandwich was very good. I put the hot sauce in it and it made it better. I like the tea but I hate hat you have to ask them to get a refill."}
{"text":"Very bad experience! I been visiting this place since the first day they open, and been noticed that little by
Time they become to normal fast food restaurant,
Non impress to much, this morning were a couple
Costumers and the cashier named Britgette was very
Rude and unpolite to get our order, she dont focus on
Us she doing two or three diferent task at the same time
Writen in a time sheet or something talking with co employees and given commands to others, how come
Please do one thing but doing righ, is weir when this
Place was full of costumers we received a better service
But the owner or gm Dave is one of the kind people
In here, everybody should copy him. I am thinking to
Stop going here because that type of employees
Actitud."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Very friendly staff, clean inside and out, awesome play place for little ones. Every time I bring my family here they always take care of us. If you've never been here, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this Chick-fil-A location in Superstition springs mall.
I have been a long time customer of Chick-fil-A.  We waited for two chicken sandwiches for 20 minutes and they were without a doubt the worse sandwiches I have ever eaten. Tasted old and microwaved. I think they were greasy, nasty, small and tasted like old vegetable oil.
Won't eat here ever again. Can't believe this is a Chick-fil-A location as the food was awful.  Eat regularly at the Power rd. location (stand -alone location) and have never had a bad meal. Management should be replaced at this location."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and even better food! I love this location so much! Their waffle fries are to die for"}
{"text":"Chicfila always has great food, and this location is no exception. 
But, the thing that really sets this restaurant apart is the employees. When our order was being taken and while we were eating, the manager made sure we had everything we needed, asked how we were doing, and someone even came around to refill our drinks (even though they don't work for a tip). 

We also noticed that the manager kept up with peoples' lives. Almost every person that walked in, he had something kind to say and asked about how things were at home. Such a great place... I love seeing a place being run the right way."}
{"text":"I went to this chick fil A a couple weeks ago and it was breakfast time. But I asked if I could order lunch and they said yes. service was great as usual but when I got the sandwich and return to work the chicken on the sandwich was half the size of the normal chicken. I know this cuz I eat there multiple times a week."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant at least two to three times a week service is good as any exceptional. And you can't beat family night or a play place in a restaurant if you have small kids"}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A has limited it's menu down to the barebones. Chicken Egg White Grill, possibly one of the greatest items at CFA is no longer served. Other items not being served, spicy chicken biscuit, why can they not put a spicy chicken on a biscuit, but can do it on a bun?

Massive pass on this CFA for their limited menu. Isn't the point of a franchise chain restaurant to offer consistency? Super disappointed with the changes, especially since I've been going to this CFA for a decade."}
{"text":"Came to one of my favorite restaurants during the peak of lunch hour and i was in and out in under 5 minutes! I ordered the southwest chicken salad and it was amazing. Every time i come to chick fil a, I'm never disappointed. The chastise greeted me with a smile and said \"my pleasure\" once i completed my order. The store was clean and the employees were efficient with the order of everyone in the restaurant and at the drive thru! Such a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"I had never been to a single Chick-fil-A until recently. Now I understand what the hype is about. Oh my word, those chicken sandwhiches are so flipping good. Yes I know the owner has been in the news and I won't go into all that as I do not share his views, but I will say the food is delicious. This particular location is ALWAYS packed, no matter what time you go. You would swear they were giving away food the way people are lined up (literally) Oh and the milk shakes,  good grief. The fatty mcfatty in me cannot get enough of them. So delicious. See now my mouth is drooling already."}
{"text":"Every fast food place should run as wonderful as Chick-Fil-A does! Super nice employees. Always smiling. Great customer service! The cow was out hugging kids. The good is perfect everytime. A pleasure!"}
{"text":"Not such a fan of the chicken, but I do like the waffle fries. I don't like for the breading on my chicken to taste like honey mustard. Also pretty pricey compared to other fast food. The wifi at this location was decent, by wifi standards. Employees were all friendly, but I think next time I'll hit up the In and Out nearby instead."}
{"text":"Thanks for being such a positive presence in the community. From honoring our military and Christian values to providing the absolute best product - often for free to those most in need. We are proud to support you and grateful for your unwavering commitment to your core principles."}
{"text":"With about an hour to spare before boarding time, I decided to stop by here while on my way to my gate. I'm glad I did, as this location was consistent in quality with other ones I've been to! This is a good spot for grabbing a quick meal on the way to the gates. The lines didn't take a long time, and neither did waiting for the food. The cashiers were efficient and helpful, which was great! I got a regular meal with a chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and sweet tea. The whole meal was yummy and filled me with energy for the rest of my trip! I would definitely drop by again for another meal!"}
{"text":"This location is wonderful! During the drive-thru lunch rush, they have employees with tablets that take your order while you stay in your vehicle. At the speaker where you usually place your order, you pay there, and simply pick up your food from the window. I had an absolutely fantastic experience here today and would recommend this location to anyone in the area. The food is great but the staff truly make it a 5-star experience, even if it's just fast food."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely phenomenal! As with most CFA locations, the lines are always long, but this location is incredibly efficient without sacrificing service. The management team is actively involved with their staff ensuring everything is running smoothly as possible. My only complaint is that I often get a gallon of sweet tea to bring home and have for the week, and it's hit or miss on it being fresh and lasting more than a day or two."}
{"text":"A+ on service and quality of food. The people who work there are supper nice. The food is always consistently good. Every time I go there the wait isn't too long they keep things moving."}
{"text":"Who doesnt love Chick-fil-a? (dont answer that)  We stopped in yesterday after attempting to go to the gym.. funny how that worked out. I haven't been to too many stand-alone chickfila's. This one was nice as well as the workers. The food wait was a little long even if it was fresh and made to order. Also the fries were cold and we decided to trade them in for hot ones especially after waiting so long. Other than that everything was fine. i'm like 100% sure ill be back. -_-"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a use to be my favorite place to go but not so much anymore. The past two times I have been to this location I was not satisfied. At supper the chicken didn't seem like it was fully cooked in parts and rubbery in others. The taste just wasn't what I was use to. At breakfast the chicken biscuit was a disappointment as well. The piece of chicken was literally a little bigger than a fifty cent piece on my biscuit and the chicken was so hard I couldn't chew it. I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-a. My wife and I eat here often. The staff is very friendly and demonstrates good customer service. One of the reasons we come to this location is because the ice cream tastes better here than the other chick-fil-a locations. (I know that sounds weird but it's true.) The staff, however, needs training on how to properly make a good ice dream cone. I am constantly disappointed at how they come out. (See pic.) Also, there seems to be no difference between a large and a small. Don't charge me for a large cone give me a small. Lastly, they dont pack the ice cream in the base of the cone so half the time it falls off the cone into your lap. I'll give 5 stars when I get a well executed ice dream cone. UPDATE!!!!!!
Got a good looking cone tonight! Strong work TRISTYN! Give that guy a raise!"}
{"text":"Love their ice cream!!
It is the absolute best. Love their service and their
Chicken is good too:) I used to come here and work during the day. They were very accommodating and always stayed on top of my refills."}
{"text":"For knowing chick fil a for there quality and consistency this new location was a disappointment if you know this spot there quality is always on point had a spicey delux and the  cheese was literally out side the box and all the fries where soggy and if you ever had this anywhere els you know there fries all always cooked well and crispy .. Total fail... Also they forgot a order of fries.. I hope this isnt going to be how the chick fil a are going to be here I"}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor of Chik Fil a and have been to many locations up and down the east coast. I love chik Fil a as they have the best customer service and usually speedy order fulfillment. This location however is slower than most during the lunch time rush so make sure you get there with enough time if you're rushing! Only one attendant at the drive thu as well and limited parking!"}
{"text":"This is the poorest managed Chick Fil A I have ever frequented.  The service is terrible and you are lucky if you get the correct order let alone within 15 min. whether you are in the drive thru or the restaurant.  I have spoken to management twice and absolutely nothing has changed.  Don't waste your time here.  Drive to another one quickly."}
{"text":"For fast food Chicfila is pretty good.  The one thing that truly sets them apart is their staff. The employees are always polite, pleasant,  & seemingly happy. This restaurant is no exception. Whatever do they at corporate level certainly reflects in the franchises. More  businesses would benefit from this level of customer service."}
{"text":"I do like Chick-Fil-A but noticed some quality differences with this location from the other locations I have visited. The drive thru line at lunch is ridiculous (prepare to wait at least 15 minutes) but decided to wait anyways just for pure convenience and part laziness. Service was pleasant as always, I do like when they address you as \"Sir\" or \"Ma'm\" and say \"My Pleasure\". Staff is very accommodating and helpful. However, when I got back to eat my lunch, I noticed the chicken sandwich I ordered was very overcooked and the lettuce was soggy and almost brown in color. The usual large piece of tomato was just two measly tomato slices plopped down. Honestly, I did eat it but was very surprised at what the quality was here...I've never had this issue before. I hope management reads this and can improve their product."}
{"text":"The food here is always good service is usually good but today I was so disappointed. As a mom with two little you come here thinking they are going to help you out. Well as I'm sitting down there are two workers cleaning and going around asking people if they are ok. One of them went by every single table getting refills except mine. Asked everyone if they needed anything except me. When they brought my food I asked for a smaller straw when she brought my drink without a straw she said they don't have one and walked away didn't even bring me a long one. The tables were dirty I had to wipe them down. And the cherry on top was when I had to get a refill bc no one came to my table I waited for 5 minutes while my kids were sitting down alone. There were three workers that weren't doing anything at the moment looked at me and walked away. Until finally someone came and gave me a refill."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is so addictive (I swear, there must be narcotics in the breading or something). 

As mentioned by Ben H., the service at this particular location is impeccable. I think it's really sweet that they have fresh flowers on their tables and by the sink in the rest room. Very good service, always amazing food served hot. What more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"Friendly but not the same since Josh left. I see many new people working here and they don't seem to offer the friendly service as before."}
{"text":"OK, Those who know me know that I do not do fast food anymore....except this Chick Fil- A. The quality of most fast food is horrid, terrible bread, poor service and unfriendly employees who hate their jobs...Well, you will not find any of this here. I am HOOKED on this place. All the employees I have had wait on me are friendly and helpful, the service is fast and efficient, the food is hot and delicious. I love the nuggets with polynesian sauce and the chicken cool wraps. I also like the chicken soup and salad combo. They have the best ice tea anywhere. I have not been to other locations but I am a loyal customer. All I can say is kudos to the management and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-a and I really wish they were in New York. The prices are completely reasonable and the quality of food is so good! It would put McDonalds to shame. 

Their chicken nuggets and strips are so fresh it honestly gets me every time. Additionally, the chick-fil-a sauce is a must try! They have also come out with a honey mustard BBQ sauce which I have to admit is better than the chick-fil-a sauce! I didnt think it was possible but it is. I used to mix the chick-fil-a sauce and BBQ and now with this new sauce they kind of did it for you. Anybody who has been here and tried the chick-fil-a sauce knows why its such a big deal, especially to claim there is something better! 

The staff here was really nice. I found it funny because one of the girls asked us right away where we were from. We answered NY and an employee asked \"Why are you here\" which my friends and I thought was hilarious. And of course like the New Yorkers we are we teased her for a little like \"should we go back\" \"you don't want us\" She seemed to be really embarrassed so playing around with her seemed to ease her up.

Overall, one of my favorite fast food places."}
{"text":"Stonecrest Chick-Fil-A is my favorite by far.  They do a phenomenal business and are very well organized.  They hire young folks and train them well.  When busy, they bring the food to your table and are constantly circulating asking if there's anything you need including re-filling beverages.  Everyone seems to have a great attitude which is hard to find in the service industry!  This particular location also seems to have a lot of special events (free breakfasts, buy a combo-get a kid's meal free, etc).  If you live in the area, be sure to sign up for their text updates so you can stay up to date with their offerings!  I wish I owned this place....CASH COW!  Did I say cow?!?  Eat more chicken..."}
{"text":"Folks, this is not your typical fast food place.  The employees are glad to be working here and it shows in the way they interact with the customers.  I go here and to the one on Stapely Dr. and both places the employees can sometimes be heard chatting and laughing happily while they work.  It's true... I kid you not.  The morale is A1 and that makes it a pleasant place to eat.

If there is a problem with your order, they are happy to fix it.

The food is served very fast, it's very good, and the place is always very clean.  There is a gluten free menu online and they can actually print out the nutritional values from the cash register.  My favorite item is the Charbroiled & Fruit salad.  The cross cut fries are not smothered in salty seasoning with MSG (Except for the kind of dressing I get has it.. not sure about all of the flavors though).  

Oh, and one more thing... you won't find any *pink slime* here."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and like most of these fast food places, its nice and efficient.  This particular location is busy most of the time from breakfast to dinner; however, they still manage to keep it quick.

The food is the standard cookie-cutter Chick-Fil-A, always full of sodium and tasty --nothing unusual here.

This location has a great play area for kids.  It's nicely situated so you can eat whilst the maniacs bounce off the walls working off that highly processed food they just ingested. 

The drive through at this place can get pretty crazy, though they do have people outside taking orders face-to-face to expedite the line which is nice.

This restaurant is very clean and always has great staff.  They continuously walk around seeing if you need sauces and asking if they can get you anything --and always smiling."}
{"text":"My new hot spot!  Literally!  Love how you may order via the phone and pick up outside or they obtain it while on line!  Quickest service ever!  Friendly staff!  The Best Chick-Fil-A in Vegas ...so far!  Highly recommended!  Plenty of parking!"}
{"text":"After several hours of travel we found a hotel for the night and Chick-fil-A was right there. What a great feel good late dinner. I had the Creole Salad with the dressing recommended y the server. It was absolutely delicious. My husband had the grilled chicken club. The staff was so helpful and sure made us feel comfortable"}
{"text":"Went there this morning as I routinely do, however this time was different. There was 1 untrained cashier tending to 20 people waiting in line for food. It took nearly 30 minutes to get to the front of the line; once there I ordered my sandwiches (w/ no pickles - I'm allergic) and sauce for each. After another 15 minute wait for food, I get home to find out there are pickles on my sandwiches, and no sauce. Thanks for ruining my meal and wasting my money Chik fila. I think I'll opt for Cane's next time."}
{"text":"At first I was not excited that my husband wanted to eat here, but then I changed my mind based on my positive experience. As expected, the line to order and check out was a bit long during lunchtime on the weekend, but the employees did their best to keep the line moving. We placed our order and then waited at our table for an employee to bring out our food. We noticed a friendly employee offering another customer delivery to her car outside. My husband ordered unhealthy food such as the chicken sandwich, fries, and soda, and I was happy to see for me healthier options such as the grilled market salad with lite dressing, fruit cup, and diet lemonade. After we finished eating, an employee offered to clean up our table for us. As they are a Christian company, I do want them to raise their chickens as humanely as possible and without antibiotics, and I would like for them to serve people foods that will not harm their health with high fat, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar!"}
{"text":"The lines of customers were long, but the wait was OK. We enjoyed the taste of our chicken nuggets, fries, chicken sandwich, chicken salad, and fresh-squeezed lemonade."}
{"text":"It's about effing time! Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Chick-fil-A! I have been by several times since opening and will no doubt be back several times more. The staff here go above and beyond to make sure your experience is excellent and I have been inside, in the drive-thru as well placed mobile orders and each time my food has been consistent and I've never had to wait long. I mostly always place mobile orders since it's just easier and you can still redeem rewards including calendar rewards with mobile ordering with very little if any wait when you arrive to get your order. 

Chick-n-Minis ($3.15) - Why oh why do you only get an option for 4 count?!?! I'd really like at least an extra mini, so a 5 count would be great. Maybe one day we will get the option of how many per order just like with the nuggets. The minis are Chick-fil-A Nuggets on a mini yeast roll that is brushed with honey butter. This is my absolute favorite thing to eat here! Good by themselves or dipped in your favorite CFA sauce. Only available at breakfast time. 

Hash Browns ($1.09) - I had to start ordering myself and hubby our own orders of hash browns because one order simply will not do lol. These crispy and tasty gems are addicting! I open up the box that they come in and it looks like a lot, but before I know it the box is empty and I have eaten them all because they are just yummy.

Chick-Fil-A Deluxe Sandwich ($4.05) - This chicken sandwich has lettuce, tomato, dill pickle chips and American cheese on a butter toasted bun. It doesn't come with mayo or any type of sauce, so you'll need to ask for mayo on the side or one of your favorite CFA dipping sauces. I personally like extra mayo on mine and it comes in packets here which I like because then I can add the amount I want. This is a very tasty sandwich and filling. 

Waffle Fries ($1.99 for a large) - These are hot, crisp and tasty. I prefer to eat these right when getting them rather then taking them home to eat because they loose the crisp factor and get softer as the waffle fries sit in the bag during the car ride home. While good by themselves, dipping sauces make the perfect paring for these waffle beauties. The dipping sauces come in a variety of flavors and they'll add any of them to your order at no charge. You can however purchase larger take home tubs if that's your thing. 

The drive-thru has 2 lanes and they always have several people out there keeping it moving along. They offer catering. Eat Mor Chikin."}
{"text":"Another visit, another outstanding performance from the staff.  World class service and delicious hot food!  I got a number #1, my fav."}
{"text":"Consistently perfect experiences.  Never a complaint.

Now, if we can just keep rude customers from plugging up the \"mobile pick-up\" spots when they are not there for a mobile pick-up.  Seriously folks, have some class."}
{"text":"I had to drive to this location until one closer opened to me and had no problem doing so. Now I stop by when I'm in the area and it's been consistently good as far as both food and service go. I usually order from the app and have had no issues with that. Honestly waiting in line doesn't mean a long wait because they really have things down here requiring very little wait time for orders and even if I have to wait a few minutes it's all good knowing what deliciousness is coming my way. 


The chicken is seasoned, hand-breaded and cooked in 100% refined peanut oil. I love the Chic-fil-A sauce, but honestly the chicken is so tasty it really doesn't require any sauce, however it does pair well! Nuggets are my go-to for lunch or dinner and when it comes to breakfast anyone who knows me knows I'm all about the Chick-n-Minis which are tasty gems. Waffle fries are a must and they have Cherry Coke from the fountain. Bathrooms and dining area are always clean and there's a drive-thru. Eat Mor Chickin."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy chicken deluxe and I have to say it was probably the best spicy chicken sandwich I've had from a fast food place,but for all the hype the food could've been served hot. But kuddos for not charging extra for sauces I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Great location, always busy. Food is consistent. Manager is great always helpful, not afraid to actually get in there and work. Team is always smiling. They have all of there sauces out where you can pick out what you need, a big plus compared to others I have been too. They have balloons for kids!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service.  The employees are always very attentive.  All sandwiches and nuggets are perfect.  Hard to find better fried chicken."}
{"text":"I know who usually gives Chick-Fil-A two stars but everything has its time and place. This evening went through the drive thru and order a meal for  myself and a kids meals for my son.  Forgot to put a kids prize/book for him. Had to turn around and go back to get it. Then half way home to a sip of my drink and it's Dr Pepper even though I ordered a Diet Coke. Even the receipt said Diet Coke. So I turned around for that. Issue is the kids that work there are too busy Snapchatting and instagraming instead of focusing on the task at hand."}
{"text":"I also agree, it's kind of out of the ordinary to write a review for a fast food place, but this Chik-fil-a has got it right down to a T. Their customer service is top notch, better than some sit down restaurants, and the food is amazing also! especially the fries. ALWAYS fresh. This is the only CFA I go to now. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Bummer breakfast. We aren't ones to complain but....
My office sent me to pick up breakfast for everyone on the company card, we had to pay some of it with cash too, but the manager this morning had to refund and recharge our order - she wasn't very nice about it either which was uncomfortable. 
One of the fruit cups and breakfast bowls were half empty... and the fruit had that fermented smell like it wasn't fresh from this morning! We didn't eat it."}
{"text":"Didn't get my order right. Didn't give me straws and then argued about it when I asked. Still didn't give me enough straws, I didn't realize until home. Never had an issue before with a different location. It obviosely matters where you go."}
{"text":"Like they say \"it's my pleasure\" it was also ours. The food was fresh and quick. Got the morning chicken biscuit sandwiches and a Sprite. We will always be back."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken you can never go wrong with this location that's why I love eating here when I'm out of New York the food is fresh and the staff always has a smile"}
{"text":"Chick fil a is honestly a miracle from heaven. Couldn't live without. I praise god everyday for the wonderful food chick fil a has provided. Staff here is amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best fast food joints to escape the confinement of the mall venue.Now that It has hit the main stream Chick a filet is making up for lost time. Their treatment of the simple chicken sandwich is fantastic.
Great flavor, chicken always moist, tender and flavorful. The shakes are very good and complete your experience. Not bad for fast food, the service is quick, friendly and spot on accurate. Ahold place to score a quick, tasty, inexpensive and relatively healthy lunch.

{"text":"They do a great job at taking care of their customers as it is pretty busy!

Each crew member had a pleasant nature to them. I will say, I think it's in their script to say \"my pleasure\" to every \"thank you\"

I'm a big fan of their spicy deluxe, ice cream cones, waffle fries, chick fil a sauce and their crushed ice.

I'm not a fan of frozen lemonade. I was expecting a lemonade slush and instead it was like a lemon starburst milkshake. Next time, I'll probably go for the basic lemonade or pretty pink watermelon limeade.

If you hate lines or crowds, I'd recommend you save yourself some waiting and order online. You probably wouldn't have to wait that much longer if you order in line though."}
{"text":"If I order a chicken sandwich with cheese, and the cheese is just thrown on there not even melted, we have a problem. It's a bit dirty and unorganized and they're not even full."}
{"text":"Chic fil a for ASU. Not kid friendly and NOT open for breakfast. Only lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"long story short, they messed up my order in drive-thru and was able to get a replacement meal the next day. Thanks, Dana, for making things right so quickly!"}
{"text":"Disgusting the fries had no salt and chicken n strips were bland.  I usually don't eat out but we were on the road and I'll tell you what this place made me mad to eat fast food.  I actually gave my fries away.  Horrible"}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich you can buy anywhere. Service is GREAT, employees keep coming by to see if you need anything, they also refill your drinks. GREAT place."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Chick-fil-A's around the country. This one was just as GREAT as all the others. Great chicken and always extremely friendly service. The place was very clean, a big plus."}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A and this one is no exception. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I have 3 little kids and they will bring our food to the table so I don't have to wait on it. The service is fast and the food is great. It is always clean. I can take my kids here to feed them, let them play in the play area while I use the free Wi-fi to read on my kindle or use my iPad. My kids always trade the toy from their kids meal in for a free ice cream cone. Great value for a family and time well spent!"}
{"text":"It's Chick-fil-A so I'm not able to tell you anything that you don't already know except one lil' observation.  

Have you ever listened to to music they play there?  It's weird.
It's like some church-cult-like music.  Really, why would I make this up?

It's a great chicken sandwich.  It can stand on it's own without the creepy soundtrack."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. To repeat other reviews, the service is fast; probably the quickest I have ever experienced. As with most other locations I have visited, the staff is genuine and friendly."}
{"text":"Just went thru drive thru. It looked like a long line but went so fast! They are incredibly efficient and organized! The girl Stefanie that took my order was extremely kind, sweet and helpful. Amazing customer service! Food is gooood!"}
{"text":"Although the line in the drive thru is long and may look scary, it goes by relatively fast! The employees I have dealt with here are friendly and seem happy to have a job, unlike most McDonald's where they seem incredibly miserable. Food was better than I remember (I used to eat from CA locations) will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Walked over on the night of the grand opening. Expected the wait to be ridiculous, but only waited 45 minutes. Not terrible. 

The service was great! Over the top. Can't quite say \"fast\" because it was the grand opening night. 

Ordered a chicken sandwich, grilled chicken nuggets, waffle fries (duh) and a coke. I was quite amazed with how delicious the sandwich was. Great quality chicken, and tasty buns! ;) Fries, of course, were the best part of my meal. I wasn't super impressed with the grilled nuggets...they were---eh----. 

Had Chick-Fil-A YEARS ago, maybe once. I definitely think this place is seriously overhyped. Doesn't take away from the food tasting great. I'll definitely be a regular, just like I am with Pollo Loco. :)"}
{"text":"I love chick fil a and the service has always been the best for fast food but this place has by far the most rude and disrespectful employees. Never returning. In addition my food was cold."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a play place for kids 3 and under which is nice. Great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Worst Chic-fil-A ever. Chicken strips literally smaller than ketchup packets! Pure insanity here. And the whole restaurant is filthy! The bathrooms should be condemned. All around ZERO stars!"}
{"text":"It was my very first time here today and it was amazing! They took my order super fast and as soon as we sat down, they brought my order to the table! This was so good since we were in a bit of a rush! Customer service was great and everyone was super nice! I really liked the guy going around checking on everyone and grabbing dirty trays so we don't have to! They're really clean and organized here. The food was absolutely amazing especially the sauces. I tried their chicken tenders and my boyfriend did the spicy chicken sandwich. We were wowed! It wasn't super greasy like other places and it was just sooooo good! We're definitely going to be regulars from now :)"}
{"text":"It's Chick-Fil-A....what can I say? I can eat it every day....YAY!!"}
{"text":"Everytime you come in you're greeted with smiling staff. So polite and very helpful.  I witnessed an older woman struggling to find a table as I was actually getting up to offer mine to her a staff member interviened and took her to an empty table that was hidden behind an group of people. It gets crowded and can be overwhelming without great staff.
Good job chik fil a 2 thumbs way up"}
{"text":"Love Chik-fil-A! Every time I've been to the Stephanie warm springs location it's been great. Friendly staff, clean, and inviting. Of all locations in southern Nevada, this one is my favorite. My obsession with Chik-fil-A might be a problem, lol."}
{"text":"Coming from Atlanta where Chick-Fil-A is almost as popular as Waffle House, I have to admit, I'm a fan... but the main reason I like Chick-Fil-A?  Their diet lemonade!

I'm not kidding - I go to this location quite often, utilize their drive thru window, and order my large diet lemonade with light ice... the tart flavor on a hot afternoon is so refreshing!

I like that they offer fresh fruit as well, and I admit that I've had their ice cream cones on several occasions too..."}
{"text":"Not the nicest chick-fil-a.  Limited menu, not so nice inside, not great service. Food is okay though and it's conveniently located."}
{"text":"We live in Prescott Valley so trips to Phoenix mean Chick-fil-A whenever possible. We came to this location because it was close to my grandma's house. When we checked in and saw 2 stars, we figured they must be reviews from teenagers from the high school. Nope. Worst location we've ever been to. The dining room was filthy, trash cans full, took a really long time to order even though we were second in line, none of the usual service or \"my pleasure\". The only plus side was I got a salad for the first time ever and it was actually pretty good- the Spicy Southwest one."}
{"text":"IBeing from Texas I'm already a chik fil a lover! I just went about 30 mins ago and the line for the drive thigh was way long but with as many workers they had it took less than I thought a d was quick and painless...well almost. After I got my sauces from the sauce guy with the sauce cart, I drove off slowly and noticed something under my front left tire. I realized it was a cone and stopped. All of sudden this lady that was directing the traffic after you got your meal gave blowing her whistle and yelling at me out of no where. I roll my window down and giggle (I mean it was a little funny I thought, it was a dam traffic cone!) and say ops did I run over a cone? The lady screams at me \"you need to pay better attention to what the he'll you're doing next time.\" RUDE AF. I calmly tell her i didn't see it it was in a blind spot (as high as my dashboard is) it was not a tall cone so I didn't see it. I'm sorry. She yells at me again \"No, you went paying attention.\"how dare she tell me what I saw or didn't see....I had such a nice experience with every other employee I came into contact with today but this one that yelled at me like I was her child or something really made me consider not going to this location anymore. What a bummer. She was the third rudest person I have ran into today. What is everyone's problem? Is it because it's Valentines day?"}
{"text":"This location use to be my favorite not anymore I will not be returning after the way we were talked to and they have a cashier or lead to thank for that. She was utterly rude, belittled me cause of my Indian culture, I will not be treated such way, and will make sure that anyone i know and their families and friends don't dine here either since we know the truth how u all feel"}
{"text":"The staff here is VERY friendly! It's always a pleasure to hear them say, \"My pleasure!\" Restaurant is always clean and the decor has a new-age style. Food is ALWAYS amazing! One time I ordered extra pickles on my number one and they didn't give me extra pickles. I called the store and spoke to management. They apologized and offered to send me coupons in the mail for my troubles. I received those coupons within a week with a hand written letter from John, the office supervisor, apologizing for forgetting the extra pickles. I was blown away by their excellent customer service! I will definitely return in the near future!"}
{"text":"I love Chick Fil A but my experience today was not good at all. The bathroom had no toilet paper so I let the employee know as she was going in and I was coming out. I came back 10 minuets later and still no toilet paper. The staff was super slow despite the fact they were really busy and only had 1 register open but all kinds of people walking around back there.  I saw a shift leader just stand there for 10 min waiting for his own food but offering no assurance to anyone else. No sense of urgency at all"}
{"text":"I love spicy chicken sandwiches so god damn much. Sorry for taking the lords name in vain but Jesus Christ you guys can fry some chicken! Also you guys are always very quick and friendly so more points for that. One of the better fast food chains in existence in my opinion."}
{"text":"In spite of globetrotting a fair amount and NOT living in a cave I've missed Chick-fil-A until today. It has definitely displaced a beef option or two when fast food is needed. Several sauces are gluten free as are the grilled chicken nuggets. Hand dipped milk shakes take prep time but compare to results from specialty ice cream shops in my opinion. Half a dozen uniformed Gilbert police were among customers.  Management and staff were totally in tuned with customers in service and courtesy; they made me feel like I was at a Ritz Carlton or surrounded by \"Minnesota nice.\" I'll go back."}
{"text":"Wow for the effectiveness of the drive  through. Its so quick and easy even when its busy. Protein style spicy chicken sandwich is a great lower carb option. I love it on my cheat day."}
{"text":"When you order nuggets and it's as big as your thumb :( has happened more then once now. Seems like their meals are getting smaller and smaller"}
{"text":"When chick fil a first opened here in Vegas, we were excited but very shocked when we realized how long the lines were... every single day.
We ended up going drive thru and although the line was over thirty people long, we were ordering, paying, and leaving within five minutes.

The efficiency of this fast food restaurant is honestly amazing.
They have people taking your order while you wait in line and everything moves so quickly you don't have time to realize how many people are in line in front of you.

The quality, of course, is amazing for how cheap it is.
Compared to other chicken places, this is definitely one of the best.
The dipping sauces are one of the most redeeming qualities of the restaurant. They're all free (+1 cool points) and you can ask for as many as you'd like (+1 more cool point).

Very surprised with the operations of everything, and am very pleased with the staff, menu, price, everything.

Overall I would recommend to anyone who enjoys chicken anything, for an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves ChickfilA. Especially my little one. We had a busy day after school, so I stopped by to pickup some nuggets. Paid for 2 orders of 12 piece nuggets and a sweet tea. I received 2 orders of 4 piece nuggets ;(. It's always so rushed at the drive-thru window. I called because I paid for 24 nuggets and received 8. Unfortunately, I was driving and already too far to turn around. I'm writing this review because it's the 3rd time at this location. I called and spoke to Megan.  when She asked me to come back, I told her it was too far and asked to cancel my transaction instead. She said she couldn't do that but offered to replace my meal and would send me a gift card in the mail. It's been 3 weeks. Mail is slow but not that slow...2 stars because they are always super polite and they food is good, when you actually receive it."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to Chik Fil a, I wouldn't consider this chain an ordinary fast food restaurant because of their reputation with their extraordinary service and especially the workers responding back with \"my pleasure.\" As far as customer service at this location they are alright, nothing too extra or bazaar but definitely tolerable. But for my orders, the last couple times I've been they've messed up my orders completely. I'm not sure who the food runner has been but you guys should definitely get it together. No one wants to get home to expect something else other than what they've ordered in the bag!"}
{"text":"Confession time.  When I lived in Buffalo, a friend and I actually drove to Erie just to visit a Chick-Fil-A.  So I am probably a bit biased towards loving the place.  That being said, there are places I love that have disappointed me and warranted negative reviews.  The Miracle Mile location did not disappoint.  Every time I have  visited (even when there are long lines), things move quickly and efficiently.  Food is always fresh and extremely tasty.

My favorites are the spicy chicken sandwich and the waffle fries.  The chicken is moist and features just the right amount of spice.  I also enjoy that there are options other than fries for your sides.  The carrot and raisin salad is very tasty and you can also get fruit or a regular salad.  

Try their seasonal shakes.  In the winter, there is a candy cane chip shake that is out of this world.  

When you dine in, there is actually some degree of table service (asking if you need a refill on pop, bringing napkins, etc).  Impressive touch for a fast food joint.

Overall, Chick-Fil-A is my favorite place to go for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Very friendly service I had the spicy chicken sandwich it was nice and hot and very juicy,the wife had the grilled chicken sandwich and she enjoyed it very much..:-)"}
{"text":"You basically can't go wrong with Chick-Fil-A and this location doesn't disappoint.
I've visited several times and have been pleased with each and every visit.
The first time I visited I was with my toddlers for a family night.  They had a table set up on the side of the restaurant with a fun craft.  In addition to the fun (and free!) craft, they also had a sundae bar and balloons for the kids.  It was nice to have an evening out with a fun activity without breaking the bank.
Chick-fil-a employees are always pleasant and accommodating.  I absolutely love the fact that they will assist you with getting high chairs to a table or with getting food to your table if your hands are full with trying to wrangle kids.  Sometimes even family friendly sit down restaurants aren't that accommodating.  
A meal might cost you more than other fast food chains (mostly because they don't have a dollar/value menu like some places have) but the quality far surpasses any other chain which makes the prices worth it.  Food is always fresh and tasty.  But if for some reason you have an issue with your order, the staff is always quick to rectify the situation.
There are almost always offers for something if you use the app, which is a huge plus.
I definitely recommend chick-fil-a and the wonderful staff at this location."}
{"text":"Am I the only person on this earth who thinks chik fil a is disgusting? Like I could just dump salt in my mouth and get the same outcome. The over done customer service creeps me out and I am just a hater. Also, the entire company is just an embarrassment."}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with their frosted lemonade! It pairs perfectly with their delicious original chick filet no pickles !"}
{"text":"Impressed with the grand opening. I was bummed though because I ordered to go and didn't open my sandwich and was given a different sandwich than what I had requested. Tried to call and let them know but it was super busy and no answer. I understand people are human however so things happen. Will definitely be back. Hopefully all food makes it home correctly next time!"}
{"text":"For a while, I've wondered what the hype was about.  I have heard their chicken is superior to other fast food chicken (how hard can that be?).  They do serve breakfast as well as lunch and dinner.  Food is OK. Well prepared grilled and fried chicken.  Also chicken burritos.  Waffle fries are standard, and they are good.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Overall good, but I cannot say that it is outstanding."}
{"text":"Way to go guys!!!  You were listening and I appreciate it.   Much faster service at the Arizona Rd. location and it is great. Drive through times are spot on ands that's important for my timing and need to get back to work. Good job!"}
{"text":"This place puts the DIA, in diarrhea, ate here earlier, was suspicious because  I don't think I've ever seen a place more filthy, but everyone talks about it. Omg, I'll all day, turns out, there a place more about politics and not quality food. It was awful."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food spot! Always busy but line goes quickly. Fast service, great food, and amazing customer service! Management really did an amazing job with training their staff. Everyone is so friendly, fast, and very knowledgeable. 

Food is always hot and fresh and I love the simplicity of the menu. Can't go wrong with a simple chicken sandwich. I also have gotten the chicken wrap when I'm being healthy and it's also good. 

As most people already know it is closed on sundays and most holidays but I Highly recommend (:"}
{"text":"Brought us the wrong order and was overcharged. They gave us new sandwiches. My sons was correct, mine was again wrong. Went back up to get mine changed for the second time which was finally right. Unfortunately by the time they finally got it right my son was done with his. Oh well  Great food but will NEVER again come here during lunch time."}
{"text":"I love me some Christian Chicken. Always a line out the door or at the drive through. Can't go wrong with a number 2 with pepper jack cheese and a sweet tea. Never a bad experience. I'm sure after reading this, you will say thank you. To that I say, \"My pleasure.\""}

{"text":"I am so glad you are here! I lived walking distance from you in IN and AL! I've lived here 1.5 years and have craved your original chicken sandwich and diet lemonade and frozen lemonade and your delicious shakes! You are on Stephanie where I usually go when I go shopping! I drive with my dog sometimes, and Chick-Fil-A was always a favorite stop. He loves your nuggets! Welcome! Thanks for being my oasis in the desert!"}
{"text":"For the first time, I am giving a fast food spot 5 stars. Why?? Because they exceed expectations every single time. 
Hands down best customer service of any fast food place, every staff member is super helpful and polite. Also ending everything with \"it's my pleasure.\" Now I am sure they are trained to say it, but it also seems like they genuinely mean it. 
How many other fast food places come around to your table if you are dining in, and ask if you need refills on your drinks. None that I can think of, except for something like Showmars, which I categorize slightly differently that your \"typical fast food'.
Food is always hot and fresh, I have never had an order messed up, can't say that about any other fast food.

So the moral of this review is, in a fast food world, this is a 5 star experience. 5 stars like a steakhouse downtown, maybe not, but they have earned their 5 fast food stars for sure. 

Thanks Chick-Fil-A!!

Now you just have to open on Sundays!!! lol"}
{"text":"Why you should come here:

Cause you don't have to drive ALL THE WAY to St. George, Utah to get your fix anymore! This institution from Hapeville, Georgia has finally decided to meet the demand and set up shop in \"Sin City\"!!! Believe you me, there's sin in EVERY city..... 

Where's it located?

Two locations to serve you...here in Anthem(that former frozen custard spot) and one in Hendertucky on Stephanie Street...Soon-to-be third location on Sahara, off I-15

What you should get:

We had no idea that Chik-Fil-A did breakfast,  so while in line with some Georgia transplants, they gave us suggestions on what their favorites were, so we ended up trying the everything Bagel Chicken Breakfast Sandwich, 
and the Chicken Biscuit Sandwich...everything was pretty good,  but for me, I'd just stick to a Spicy Chicken Sandwich when the cravings hits. I kinda like their lunch stuff better. Service is most definitely 5 stars!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"I love Chick-fil-a. Food is always great, but this location's customer service is a hit or miss for me. It's either really good or bad. The last couple trips I've made here had me leaving mad because I got attitude for stuff that doesn't matter.

The first instance, my homegirl and I were leaving and this girl was with a stand outside giving out sauce. She wasn't clear that we could only get 2 sauces per meal/person. But she was making it seem like my friend was stupid and couldn't do math when there was just miscommunication. I was especially annoyed because the next time I came, the guy had no problem giving me like 5 sauces when it was just one meal. It's just sauce. I don't get it.

The next instance, it was late at night and there was barely anyone at the drive-through. The girl asked for my name before I ordered but took her like 3 tries before she figured it out (or not who knows..). But I was irritated that she needed a name. I understand if there's a long line, but there were about 3 other people in line. she was clearly irritated too because she was giving me sass after. 

She asked what I wanted and I proceeded to tell her the first meal I wanted. She didn't even ask what drink I wanted with the meal before she asked so quickly if I wanted anything else so I could stop talking to her (*rolls my eyes) I told her the drink I wanted then told her the next meal I wanted, which I could tell made her even more annoyed that I indirectly pointed out that she missed something. When I got my food, they just read my order back to me (not say my name). I wish she was at the window when I got my food so I could tell her that I didn't order a side of attitude. 

I'm not those entitled customers that ask for the manager for every little thing but I have never experienced such bad customer service before, not even at any other fast food place. Definitely did not expect this from Chick-fil-a. Will still go here because it's Chick-fil-a LOL but beware of sassy workers."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch at drive-thru recently.  With single digit degree temperatures and wind chills below zero, they had two order takers and a cashier outside to expedite the drive-thru line. It only took a few minutes from ordering to picking up our food , it was fresh and hot.  Fantastic service, great product and a competitive price.  Excellent weekday lunch experience."}
{"text":"This place has always been one of my favorite growing up in Ga! Finally got to introduce my family to this fast food chain. Kids enjoyed it to the point we had to get it every day we were in Georgia lol! Even when we got to the airport in Cleveland. I'd highly recommend the crispy chicken sandwich with the waffle fries and Polynesian sauce!  Very friendly service, great southern hospitality...."}
{"text":"I feel like it's really hard to not like Chik-Fil-A.... I mean who doesn't like most of the food that they offer!  But service and cleanliness and how speedy they can be can surely effect this opinion!

My mom and I were getting some car work done down the street and walked down to this location mid morning.  We barely made breakfast- but made it!  My mom is from NY and isn't super familiar with the menu so I had to somewhat coax her here versus the neighboring Dunkin Donuts.  

I tried the breakfast burrito- it was surprisingly delicious!  Had a side of salsa with it.  She went with the more common bacon egg and cheese on a biscuit.  Both were fresh and tasty.  I tried the iced coffee- not a big fan.  Too sweet for my tastes.  She enjoyed her lemonade.

The restaurant was not super busy at this time.  I'm assuming lunch time it will have the crazy drive thru line like most others in the area.  Service was very friendly- an employee came to our table and asked if we were doing well and offered refills.  My mom was taken back since she's not used to this kind of service at a fast food chain!  Solid Chik-Fil-A."}
{"text":"I came to the Homestead Chick-fil-A today and had the 4-piece tender, large fry, and medium sweet tea. The fries and the tea were good, but my chicken definitely could have been cooked longer. It had a weird consistency to it; kind of slippery like raw chicken, but cooked obviously. I'll chalk it up to an off-day because Chick-fil-A cares about their customers. I was just in too much of a rush to go back."}
{"text":"I was just completely underwhelmed by today's visit at the Chick-fil-A in the Cathedral of Learning. I wasn't expecting a full-option operation (being that this is a Chick-fil-A Express) but it would have been nice to have the spicy chicken sandwich available and at least one flavor milkshake. The associates were blunt and disinterested; the counter is also hidden unless you know precisely where to find it.

Review #208."}
{"text":"Of course the food is good, employees are nice but I have never been to a slower Chick-fil-A in my life. I sat through the drive thru for 20 mins. Chick-fil-A is always super fast but these people seemed to have zero urgency. Extremely annoying."}
{"text":"Drive-through line doesn't move. restaurant line doesn't move. This store needs to take lesson from Belmont store and learn how to run their cooking and service line more quickly and efficiently. They must need more staff and proper training."}
{"text":"Yes this location was slow when they first opened but it is my favorite chick-fil-a now. More modern than most in town and very clean and great service."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! Yes, it's busy, however drive-thru is actually fairly quick and takes the same amount of time as any other fast food drive-thrus during peak hours. I get the deluxe spicy sandwich combo with vanilla cold brew iced coffee. YES, their cold brew is surprisingly delicious! A must try for a iced coffee lover who would find themselves nicely surprised that a fast food chain finally delivers good iced coffee! Their fries are also just so warm and delicious. I mean who wouldn't enjoy all those sauces that they offer, but house sauce is always my faveeee. Oh and as for the main attraction, the deluxe spicy chicken sandwich, the cheese is somehow always perfectly melted and chicken is cooked right. I keep going back. It's about $10 for a meal but it is really good. Ohhh! Don't forget the ice cream :D it's milky and creamy. Btw they're closed on sundays!"}
{"text":"Ok these people need to start being fucken trained right , hey I get it people make mistakes. Well I pull up 7:50am on a Tuesday oct 11 20016  Not one dam  person in line , me and my wife where the only one there , so I said the first order, It was # 7 which was a bagel and chicken , egg sandwich and Diet Coke LITTLE ice.  Now see that order should stand out.  And she repeated it to me then my wife proceeded tonthe tell  her the rest , and repeated it back We get to the window . We pull up to window , like I said we where  the only one in line , I give him my card he swipes the card and then the idiot repeats my order , then I say what about my # 7 that was the first item on my order so he's reply you want that on top of that.   Wow well if it was the first item yes   So he says that will be , gave him my card again.  All good you think , hands the Diet Coke and then the food order and says ...... here you go thank you.  I said what about the diet Dr Pepper my wife ordered and then another persons says here and gives me the rest of the food.  Ok like I said mistakes happen and most of the time people will forget them if you make a effort to apologize and make it right ,   I didn't want the food for free but at the end after he realizes he the screwed up he could've said he's a coupon for free drink or meal or something.  No nothing .  Hey corporate get your head straight teach them some old school values in life .   So if some knowledge person at that store wants to make it right.  My email is jkcouple1011@yahoo.com if anyone there wants to show some customer support right."}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service ever. Ordered a late lunch with wife and kids,  $25.45. They screwed up the sandwich. I politely brought it back to the counter and jokingly told them \"there's nothing deluxe about this and its not spicy\", the cashier took it to the line manager who then instructed her to make me show a receipt. Well, we declined a copy of the receipt because:

A. Its a waste of paper.
B. Who the hell thinks they require a receipt for a chicken lunch?

A receipt? Are you fucking shitting me? Did I just buy a pair of pants at fucking Wal-Mart?
 
The price difference was less than a dollar. So, I'm 43, dressed nicely and with my wife and children. I don't feel I fit the demographic of a scammer trying to get some free meal! The cost difference is negligible and even if I had screwed up and ordered the wrong sandwich, who gives two shits!?!? It's like 83 cents difference! So I flip a dollar coin on the counter and ask if I can just have the sandwich please, as I am very hungry. Thank goodness I live in Arcadia and frequent the location at 44th and Indian School. This place is shitty. 

So to close this out, if the site owner/manager is reading. If your client is spending more than just the dollar menu don't treat them as if they're a scammer if the cost difference is about 3% of the sale. Not many people try to steal back 3%. Before asking for a receipt, just casually walk over to the cashier station and pull the previous order, then no matter what it says (again, we're talking about 83 cents) just say \"oops, sorry about that\" or tell me you rang the wrong shit and need your 83 cents and just give me what I say I ordered. 

Oh yeah, about that dollar coin, keep the change."}
{"text":"Good quick fast food. I was looking for some light take out for dinner and the three chicken strip box was perfect."}
{"text":"Multiple times leaving the drive thru with incorrect order.  We choose CFA for many reasons, but one of them is the management seems to oversee young workers and ensure mistakes are far less.  NEVER had this issue from Arboretum location in Matthews.  Frustrated!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh sweet Century III Chick Fil A."}
{"text":"This location may want to just stick to lunch and dinner.  I ordered something on the breakfast menu and they made me pull around to the front and wait for 10+ minutes to get it.  So not so fast-fast food...which is way worse in the morning when you're trying to get into work on time.  The Raintree location has their sh*t together and gets you thru in a more timely fashion."}
{"text":"Ranks with in-n-out as the best fast food. 

Grilled chicken nuggets are juicy with good grilled flavor and nice texture - not leftover chicken. Nice middle of the road BBQ sauce. 

Mac and cheese is a great side. Slightly over cooked noodles, but cheesy. 

Fruit cup side is spectacular! Not a bowl of melons  strawberry's, blueberry, mandarin oranges, and two kinds of apples. Fantastic!

The pinnacle food here is the chicken soup. Best chicken soup bar none. Excellent chicken flavor, meaty, and superb broth. The best chicken soup anywhere. 

I also like the foam cups for drinks - keeps them cool. 

Staff is friendly and helpful. Seating is clean, comfortable and better quality than typical fast food."}
{"text":"An occasional stop on my way into work in the Whitehall Business park area. It's good to know that this is a part of the south Tyron area if you work their often. The line goes by very quickly, and the service ( like most Chik-fil-a's) is very friendly . If I'm not mistaken, you can pre-order with an Chik-fil-a app, but I have not tried this yet. Usually the service is so fast, no need to order ahead."}
{"text":"Food is always ok.. But I'm writing this along w some other reviews I read previously. The wait for lunch drive through is simply unacceptable.. Had two crying girls/hungry when I got in line at 1:30, had two out of control screaming girls by the time I got my food around 2:05;( 
There is no reason under any circumstances it should take this long for chicken and fries. I've never been more upset bc as previously stated once your in line, your STUCK absolutely no way out. Wanted to leave more than once and go to the arches which has never kept me in a drive thru line 30+ minutes. Never again"}
{"text":"Have taken my family there 3 or 4 times since they opened. Unbelievable service!!!!!! Very family oriented, very impressed this location also had a missing man table set on Veterans Day.

Great company all around!"}
{"text":"When traveling on business, there's very little time in between meetings to get a descent bite to eat unless you're with clients. Charlotte, NC is know for their gerbil tunnels between office complexes. To save time,  each office complex houses the usual fast food chains.

I was told Chick-fil-A was one of the best fast food chains in the southeast.  Being from Nor Cal, my business trip to Charlotte gave me an opportunity to try this out.  I was not disappointed. Connoisseur of this fast food joint told me to order the Chicken sandwich with extra pickles, waffle fries and an Icedream. Great suggestion. 

I wish there was one closer to home."}
{"text":"Ordered a #2 no pickles. First sandwich was wrong (no worries it happens). 2nd sandwich had no cheese and no lettuce, third sandwich had near frozen cheese and ends of tomatoes, fourth sandwich had cold cheese and a small little patty. I just wanted what I paid for, but never got it. That's why they get 1 star from me"}
{"text":"Well, I do not really care for their fundamentalist right wing views. But hey that is why we live in a free country.  They do chicken well.  Well some types.  If it is not fried the chicken is not good.  The salads are not very good in my opinion.  The service is outstanding.  Little shits like my nephews seem to really enjoy the nuggets here. The service is stellar, I mean off the wall good. The manager was like welcome to our family  and how can I help you,or something like that.

 Ever go to Beechwood mall on a Friday for lunch.  Amazing people watching this place really lines them up. Fried stuff good, Not deep fried = gross!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Staff is genuinely nice, polite and courteous. Food is always made to order and they are always quick too. We love this location the best."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to leave this review. I am an avid supporter of Chick-fil-A and have really never had a bad experience. Granted I haven't had amazing experiences every time I've gone to a chick fil a but most are above average. This one wasn't on point. Food was good so I gave them three stars. Knocked two off because their customer service wasn't up to snuff. We wait in line about 5 minutes upon arriving and when we get to register we order. They had a delicious sounding watermelon mint lemonade advertised and I asked if it was extra to get that versus a standard lemonade. The kid at the register said no. We didn't wait long to get our order and sat down. I looked through the receipt and sure enough there was an extra charge for this lemonade (size small btw). Well, I decided it was an honest mistake so don't worry about it....just eat it off. It's hard to think bad thoughts when stuffing your face with delicious crack nuggets! That lemonade was so good! So good I ran out and went to get a refill. GUESS WHAT!!!? They wouldn't refill it with watermelon mint lemonade!! Yeah, you heard me. The team lead that tried to explain to me that I can get free refills, just not for the watermelon mint flavor. I was perplexed and asked for plain lemonade which was \"ok\" to have refills on. I sat down and enjoyed my ice cream and again ran out of drink. I knew I wasn't \"able\" to get more lemonade with watermelon flavor but I still didn't understand why I couldn't when there was not one single place on the menu or advertisement that stated free refills were prohibited. I also noticed the big wig manager dealing with a lady that clearly perturbed about something. I overheard him saying that e could give her anything she liked to make \"it\" right. I said to myself, I guess I'm not the only one having issues today and attempted to talk to the original team lead about why I couldn't have watermelon mint lemonade? Same answer and was dismissed basically. In hindsight I should've talked to the big wig to get some answers but it looked like he was having a bad day already. Perhaps I have a high standard or this experience seems petty but being a former chick fil a employee in the heart of Georgia I know the service and customer satisfaction goals of chick fil a and these guys don't have it. They just opened about a month or two ago so I recognize most of the kids are new (and we aren't in the hospitable south either) but my concerns and questions as a customer matter and when I pay extra money for something and am told I can't have a free refill when it is not specifically stated that I cannot then I'm not gonna be satisfied. What makes matters worse is that I drive almost 30 minutes to eat here! I invest my time and money in a place I love but if I get treated like a dollar sign instead of a person I will just go to another establishment. I pray the chick fil a opening in north Vegas is on point! Good food, mediocre service, annoyingly horrendous parking lot situation, people smoking outside at the tables (in front of the employees) landed this visit at a weaksauce 3 star review."}
{"text":"The last time I went to a Chick-Fil-A was about 15 years ago in the mall and was unimpressed and it would have been a 2.  They have gotten better.  I chose the grilled chicken breast combo and it was ok.  The fries were not very crispy.  Afterward I was told by friends I should have gotten the original delux and I would have preferred the taste but I assumed there were fewer calories, salt and fat in the grilled and I was correct when I checked.  The restaurant was clean and everybody was pleasant.  So they have moved up from avoiding them to acceptable but not going out of my way."}
{"text":"It was organized and quick but I rated 2 stars for the food. My food was salty and kind of soggy. I wasn't impressed at all. The milkshake was good but that's about it. I don't think I'll be going back unless it was for the shake"}
{"text":"My favorite Chickfila location so far! This location is always clean and their service is fast and attentive.  Frequently I've met the owner taking orders.  It gets extremely busy at lunch and right when school gets out. Unfortunately sometimes the drive through line backs all the way out onto the main road but I think that's just a sign of how popular they are.  There service certainly isn't slow. I've been coming to this location for over ten years and have never been disappointed.  I would highly suggest buying the cow calendar at the end of the year so you can get the coupons each month for a free food item chosen my chickfila. There's a nice play area outside for kids as well. I don't have any kids but it seems like that would be a nice perk if I did. I've never received bad service here and you won't either."}
{"text":"With sandwiches under 400 calories, and stellar service, there is everything to love about Chick-fil-a.  This location is very clean and the employees are very kind.  We have even had employees come by and ask how our meal was or offer to refill our drinks.

My favorites are the original sandwich and the grilled chicken sandwich , the waffle fries and the fruit.  I understand the breakfast bagel sandwich is the worst item on the menu with regard to fat and calories.  It is so yummy, but I stay away from this place for breakfast.  

They also have a variety of items for dessert.  There is a play room for the kiddies with tables to eat near them.  The nice thing is the room keeps most of the screaming out of the main dining room area.  

Good food, convenient location, friendly service."}
{"text":"Everyone was super nice and the grilled chicken wraps were delicious. My son loved his grilled chicken nuggets and waffle fries, def be back."}
{"text":"I use their app to order my stuff, I've always gotten it right, no problems. They draw a smiley face on the receipt which I think is a thoughtful something. I also love their shakes, they load it up with whip cream. I eat here a lot because I work at cmc."}
{"text":"Customer service here is impeccable.  My boyfriend and I are always pleased by the impeccable manners and service of the staff!  Great job!"}
{"text":"Great food and Megan was very friendly and spoke slow and clear so you could understand the many questions they ask with every order."}
{"text":"I LOVE Chick-fil-A, but this location doesn't live up to the name or reputation of the chain. The customer service is always poor and my food has never been prepared up to par. I live close by so I've been at least 10 times, hoping that maybe they have just been mistakes, but it's clearly a lack of leadership. Do yourself a favor and go down to the location at Whitehall Commons."}
{"text":"Well known for their chicken sandwiches, however they make the best bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich.  Service is quick and team members are engaged, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I write a constructive review on this place


The owners must of cried bigtime to yelp because they deleted it

What a joke


This location always serves undercooked or overcooked chicken

The location is super difficult to get into

The drive thru is crazy around lunch time..blocks half of the parking lot


The 3 different times i have been here the $2 cookies were hard and not soft


Ive given this location 5 different chances and its always something bad


They need to learn from other chic fil a... 

I dont know what the problem is here but the management/owners. Do not care about this customer

2nd time posting a review here..  See my original review on google. 

:)


PS..instead of management/owners tryin to contact me directly...they try to get my reviews taken down... Pretty pathetic..

Shame on YELP!!!!!!   This is supposed to be for the consumers"}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 but there was one MAJOR thing that happened. My son has milk allergies and I asked if they had milk in their fried nuggets and they said no. And he ate them and ended up with a terrible allergic reaction. This happened a year or two ago but it still happened. 

Other than that the people are friendly, facility is clean! Love the play area and the community involvement."}
{"text":"I came here around the  second week of opening and boy let me tell you the lines were long. It was At the moment when I made the decision to stand out out in the cold for that JUICY, CRISPY goodness everyone's been talking about. 
Surprisingly enough, the line was moving fairly quick. Like In n Out, they have people take orders in advanced. I got the Chicken Deluxe Sandwich(w/ lettuce and tomato) meal which comes with fries and a drink. It didn't take long to get my food which is awesome since it seemed like there were 20 people waiting for theirs. 
Not gonna lie, the sandwich was really fresh and crispy. Probably one of, if not, the best in all of the fast food places I've been to. The fries were also delicious, but nothing to write home about. Their sauces however, Mm Mm mmmm! They have an assortment of sauces. Should be called sauce-fil-a instead. I believe they have 6 sauces total. My favorites were the chick-fil-a sauce and garlic and herb ranch. The 'OG' sauce is like a light honey mustard. 
Not only is the food here great, so are the staff. Each one I've encountered was nothing but sweet and friendly. They even ask to refill your drinks for you if you dine in. At a fast food joint? Mind blowing! During my meal, I almost forgot that I was in a fast food joint. The ambience is real. If you plan to dine in there are lots and I mean LOTS of tables to sit at. 

The staff, food, and atmosphere is godlike. 5/5 would dip fries in rainbow of sauces again."}
{"text":"Love my Chick-fil-a!  Wow, they have a system and it is super fast in the drive thur.  Amazed and they are always super friendly!  They always get the order right!!!  ++++"}
{"text":"Incredible service...  From taking your order at the counters to asking you if you want a refill when you look like you are finished and ready to go.  Love it!  

The quality of the food is always consistent and delicious chicken."}
{"text":"I have always been in love with Chick-Fil-A and still am. I was first hooked on them in the shopping malls, then they appeared on campus at ASU. Seems to now found my home in Avondale! 

My fave is the combo #1 with no pickle. I am not sure what spices they put in recipe, but it is addicting. All the employees are so happy to work there.  Love you Chick-Fil-A!"}
{"text":"Love the tasty chicken sandwiches and love the great service!"}
{"text":"Not a bad alternative to some of the other trite, we usually get the chicken nuggets which are fresher and seem much less processed than some of the other alternatives and are pretty tasty, I enjoy the waffle fries and coleslaw, a guily pleasure of ours are the handspun milkshakes especially the cookies and cream, and I get a kick out of the \"my pleasure\" which is more customer service than mcdonald's version which consists of thrusting the bag out the window (usually short items and condiments) to have the window slammed on me."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here for fast food and the staff is very friendly however I do not think you should have teenagers working outside taking orders at the drive-through area on the asphalt when it is 115 regardless of the water packs on their back. I felt horrible for them."}
{"text":"As busy as this place is....I am always surprised at how friendly and organized the drive thru is.  The staff is always friendly and my order is always right....even my crazy special requests. 

Love the new breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We used the app to order.  Waited for a bit for our order, which was fine.  Except the woman giving out mobile orders was so rude.  We walked out with our order only to find out it was incomplete.  We turned around and the rude woman refused to believe that the order was incomplete.  In the 30 seconds it took us to walk out and turn around, we apparently stole something.  A confrontation ensued, but we eventually got our complete order.  Definitely not what we expected based on other locations."}
{"text":"Pretty annoyed. Didn't get what I ordered and they didn't give us any of the sauces we asked for. Even the guy at the window confirmed with us and still got most of the order wrong."}
{"text":"We always come to this Chick-fil-A and it never fails something always goes wrong. I asked for no tomato extra lettuce extra pickle every time most the time the tomatoes are on there and there's like two pickles. I don't even ask for much just a little extra veggies and no tomato. People are always nice but if you can only get my order right I would love it. Only issue I have today is the lettuce you gave me is brown and wilted.  You should probably care a little bit more about how you serve your produce if you are going to promote that it's always fresh.."}
{"text":"Ok I can honestly say I was very surprised this evening. Chick-fil-A is customarily spot on with their orders but tonight was a mess. We were passing through the area after an afternoon at Seven Springs. I went inside since the drive thru line was long and they weren't busy inside. I ordered two kids meals (one with a juice box and the other chocolate milk), a spicy chicken sandwich meal and a separate drink. Then we were back on the road. About 10 minutes into our drive I realized our kids meals had no fries and the chocolate milk was a white milk. Uuuugggh!!!!! Let's try to explain to an exhausted, hungry 4 and a 5 year old that they're order is wrong. Extremely aggravated I contacted the location and the replied I received was \"sorry you had a bad experience\". Really?!?!!! Not, \"let me take our address or email and we'll send you a coupon\" or \"we'll credit you one of the kids meals\" Now the kids and I are both wigging out! Not sat!!!!

UPDATE: The day after my review I was contacted by the location's owner. I was able to provide all of the required information from my visit's receipt to assist her in rectifying this situation in the hopes that it doesn't happen again. I was extremely satisfied with her attentiveness toward our issue. She was extremely kind and professional. We look forward to our next visit to her location and continuing to give it our business. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great customer service! This location works really hard to keep the lines moving. Their drive thru is so busy so they have 2 people taking your order with their iPad, then another person does the payment part. This allows the line to move quickly. Then you just pull forward for your food. Everyone is super nice and they always great you. They actually have some personality and enjoy their job. The food is always prepared correctly and it's always hot and fresh. 

If you have a dog they give out free doggy treats. You may have to ask at the drive-thru window. Or just offer if they see your dog."}
{"text":"Chick Fill AH (that is how my friend says it) is the best fast food around.  The food quality is great.  The service is wonderful.  I have dined there many times, most after 9 pm at night, and everyone is wonderful.  Refills are easy and done without question.  They don't mind if we sit and chat.  Drive thru service is great too."}
{"text":"yummy chicken sandwich and delicious fries! The staff is so nice as well. Every time I'm in Vegas I stop her for lunch and my
Kids loves it as well."}
{"text":"Coming from the East Coast I was really excited about Chick-fil-A coming locally. Their chicken and waffle fries are awesome and they have really yummy desserts; cookies, ice cream cones and shakes.  My first visit was a bit long and chaotic but understood because it was a new establishment. Since then I have gone and have loved our dine in experiences however I have had a few issues with their drive thru.  

First, I love when I go in, the little ones can play in their indoor play area while we wait for our food and afterwards. Their staff helps us with our trays, get us condiments if needed, refill our beverages, help us with our trash and are always super pleasant.  
 
When using the drive thru, is the only time I have had any problems.  The 2 lane system still seems to be confusing. I have come into one of the lanes prior to other customers who get their meal first on a few occasions. On a few occasions when I arrive at the window my food isn't the one waiting for me also on 2 occasions, today being the second, I have had items missing from my order.  I will say that when I called regarding the mistake the manager, Jennifer, was really great in trying to resolve the incident.  

I will continue going to this Chick-Fil-A location since the quality is great, restaurant and play area are always clean but really hope that in the future the drive through is more efficient since I love the convenience of this option when on the run with 3 kids."}
{"text":"Amazing. Hands down best Chik Fil A I've been to. Nothing bad to say. They had workers take your order in person through the drive through, referred to me as my first name. Chicken was exceptional, customer service 11/10 stars. Yes."}
{"text":"It's totally fine if you are in a hurry, it's  step above McDonalds or BK but it is nothing special. The waffle fries were very bland but dipped in ketchup were ok. The chicken burger was not bad but it's really small so you might want to get two."}
{"text":"By far the most disgusting chik-fil-a restaurant I've ever been too. Syrup and crumbs on every table, floors look like they haven't been cleaned in weeks and even after bringing it to the attention of the manager things still did not get cleaned"}
{"text":"Best Fast food around!!! If you never tried the Chick-Fil-A sauce...DO IT!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. I used to work there when it first opened and everything ran smoothly and we rarely messed up orders. Today I made my first visit back to this location in quite some time. I went through the drive-thru and got a large #1 meal with 3 cfa sauces. Not only did I receive only one cfa sauce but the fries were almost unbearably salty and the drink was 80% ice. So here I am with half a cfa sandwich with no sauce left and no drink. 

Tl;dr go to 83rd and bell instead."}
{"text":"They have great fast food. My favorite is their garden salad with chicken. I also love that the kids can trade the toy for an ice cream if they don't like the toy. 

Friendly staff and the woman at the registered picked out that I was from Texas by my necklace and accent. I don't think I have an accent, but sometimes it comes out I guess. 

We were on a road trip, and seeing that Chick-fil-a sign was like a slice of heaven."}
{"text":"Went there the first day and had our food when we got done paying, literally. Great service and great restaurant chain."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chik-fil-A for at least 25 delicious years. If it wasn't for the awesome food and the ideal location here, I would steer clear of this place. The customer service is nowhere to be found. There is no sense of urgency and no one knows where to stand in line. It is a total free-for-all as far as the counters go. I have had to fight my way back up to the counter to grab my food after waiting (and waiting and waiting). In general, Chik-fil-A is run with quality food and that \"my pleasure\" attitude. You won't find that good attitude at this location. What stinks is that I love the food too much to stop coming here. Don't even get me started on their milkshakes.....drool.

You got me, Chik-fil-A. Your delicious fried and grilled chicken have won again."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Chick fil a is awesome.  Friendly, great  food, and fun place to eat.  The strawberry shakes are in my opinion the best! I just had the egg white with chicken muffin sandwich and it is excellent."}
{"text":"I do love this chicken but it is ridiculous the size pieces that you get anymore they are no bigger sometimes than a quarter I'm not paying that much anymore for it not the last time but the time before that I got it I tasted old oil it tasted like the oil has been changed in several months this last time I got it it tasted very good but the pieces were way too small come on guys this is ridiculous how much you charge for so little. I'm not going to be going to Chick-fil-A anymore it's ridiculous the size of the piece"}
{"text":"I have to say that I love Chick-fil-A nuggets and a lot of time on the way home from work I pick them up to take them home for dinner.  What a gripe I have that really pisses me off is three times now they haven't put all the nugget in the box you pay a healthy amount for a dozen of nugget and when you come up short a couple nuggets that's  not right. When I call to complain the  Manager said we just grab a handful and put them in the box so why The hell do they call them a dozen if they're a handful. And OMG there's so fricking small if it's ridiculous their prices and shorting their food. I'm going to think twice before I go back there again maybe I'll visit Wendys the next time!!!"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A continuously provides excellent quality of food and service. 

I definitely recommend this Chick-Fil-A, as I was greeted with a warm smile and friendly service, had a short waiting time, and received my quality food promptly. 

This location is located between terimnal C and B, makign it aconvenient location for switching terminals. There is a large seating space by it as well. 

I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich with their freshly squeezed lemonade!"}
{"text":"Love Chik-fil-a! Consistent, friendly service at every location I've been to with delicious food!"}
{"text":"The line wasn't bad but it was confusing and the employees seemed confused. It took 2 people to take my order which was simple. I've moved here from the Midwest so I know what the food should taste like and I was so disappointed. My sandwich looked like some one stepped on it. My top bun was almost non existent and the pickles were so tough I had to take them off because I couldn't bite through it. My kids meal was wrong but of course I realized that when I got home 25 mins away. Hopefully they work out the kinks and step up the quality."}
{"text":"Cobb Salad was great!!! Always friendly and polite here. Thanks Chic Fil a. Oh - and the Cool Wrap is also very good. Not crazy for the grilled bites as there are too few for the price. Stick to the salad and also try the wrap and you'll be in good territory."}
{"text":"Got my son a kids meal around 9pm and while he was satisfied with the 4 piece chicken nugget meal, getting the girl taking our order was unnecessarily hard.  Maybe she couldn't hear us for a good reason but anytime you have to repeat what you want three times somethings going on."}
{"text":"The food is just okay. I think its overrated. The service is good and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Visiting from southeast and this by far is the worst service and quality that we have experienced with this franchise. By contrast the 87th St location we visited yesterday for breakfast was a total different experience. Some say a company rises and falls on leadership so in our opinion management here is a failure."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A don't ya just love it... haha I was starving and decided to stop. I'm not a big fast food fan but I have a weakness for Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Usually when I visit Chick-fil-A, the service and food is very good. This visit, not so much unfortunately. I ordered the Unfried chicken nuggets and an unsweetened iced tea in the drive thru. I was given the food and the window closed. I had never ordered the unfried chicken before, and had no idea they were messy and goopy and kinda saucy. There is no way to eat them without a fork, and low and behold there was no fork given to me. Also, I guess they don't offer sauce with them either, because there was not that option either. The iced tea I got was ok, but it would have been better with some Splenda, but apparently they don't offer that either, or they were out. Anyways, after seeing what the \"meal\" consisted of, after paying $9 for it, I was annoyed by how expensive it was for what little I received. I don't think I will visit another Chick-fil-A again, that was a disgusting sloppy expensive mess of a meal.  Definitely not worth $9."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Me and my son went thru the drive thru at Dysart location here in West Phoenix, not five minutes from my house. It was about 9:20 or so and we must have gotten everyones leftovers that had been under the lamp for an hour. The waffle fries cold, hard and dry. The sandwich was cold and bread hard around edges. We hadn't gone in a while but my son said,\" this is not what I remember.\" I tried calling and of course they were closed. My son had just gotten off off work and was hungry so he ate his two sandwiches and I lost my appetite, and am so upset I put my food in the bag and will wake up extra early tomorrow to take it back and speak to manager. If they want to leave early they shouldn't make a batch and let them sit there, close early. The last customer deserves  fresh food as the first customer of the day. I work hard for my money, I paid 18.00 for two #1 combos and extra sandwich, it's expensive but I used to think it was worth a treat once in a while. Think about it, if someone gets paid 9.00 and hour they had to work 2 hours tp pay for that, if they earn 18.00 it's still an hour of work to pay for your food, forget about minimum wage! Lets remember they are taking more taxes from our checks now, most people I know have lost 100.00 and more off each check. We deserve hot fresh food!!!"}
{"text":"Solid Chik-Fil-A. I came here for lunch and ordered a Chik-Fil-A sandwich with medium fries and a drink. The staff was incredibly friendly and brought me my food when it was ready. The food was great! Just like every Chik-Fil-A I've been too. The chicken was nice and crispy. The fries were great with polynesian sauce and what can i say I'm a fan of the place, so it was very enjoyable. As I was only on vacation, but come down here eery year for Spring Training I will definitely drop by again in the future when I am back in the area."}
{"text":"My first Chick Fil A ever. Really really good Chicken sandwiches. Chicken was really good, crisp outside, perfect inside. Bun was great too.

Fantastic service for a fast food joint like this. Friendly people all around."}
{"text":"I was here on the grand opening the quality of the food was marginal the place was very disorganized.. I would not recommend this place to anyone just a bunch of greasy nasty food"}
{"text":"Exceptional service at a drive-thru. This is a sentence I never thought I'd have reason to write. But I was pleasantly surprised by my short experience here. First of all, they have two lines for ordering that merge into one for paying. There were team members standing outside to take orders. Since this was my first time here, Anthony recommended the #1 that had the sandwich, waffle fries and drink. 

I pulled forward to pay and before I even reached the next window, a gentleman brought me my food and just as I was wondering how long I'd be behind the 2 cars in front of me, he informed me that the cars would clear out in a few seconds. He was right and I was on my way. I heard only professional and courteous language such as \"my pleasure\", \"may I suggest\", and of course \"thank you\"."}
{"text":"i eat here often we take about 6 orders at a time and we never have to go back the food is bomb service is fast and nice
i feel bad for the employees who stand outside in this heat to take orders to make the line move fast but they always are happy so..
highly recommend this location"}
{"text":"love the food 
best lemonade 
EVER!

god bless this place"}
{"text":"Waffle fries are never full and always cold.  Like how.  Again.  Seriously.  How can you do this every time ...now today. A few weeks later. No napkins no ketchup no sauce.  Wtf is goin on.  Again.  April 28.  Half full fries and cold. The manager Chris is never there and the people apparently aren't trained right.  This restaurant is not as good as others."}
{"text":"aaammmmaaazziiinnnggg food! & something you dont get or see anymore amazing service - friendly & courteous staff!! ?"}
{"text":"Turns out this is one of many places I've been deprived of growning up in South Orange County. Amazingly this was the first time I had a Chick Fil-A chicken sandwich. All I can say it that it was damn tasty! Pulled through the drive through after Angels spring training and gobbled it down in under three minuites...I think. You have to ask for extra BBQ sauce cuz they only give you like one or two, 

fwiw they are ACTUALLY building one right down the street from my house!!!! You have no idea how freakin' well this place will do here!"}
{"text":"One of the best locations!

I have been going to this location for over 10 years now. Not only is it a fast experience, but the people there are awesome! Even with a very long line, you never feel like you are waiting long and the line is in constant flow. 

My order has been messed up maybe 1 time in the hundreds of times I've been there. They are always quick to make sure things are correct, even when they are correct. Someone is always stopping by your table to check on you and see if you need a refill. Things you don't expect from a fast food place. 

It still amazes me how fast this place is during the rush lunch hours. Other places could have a 1/3 of the line and you'd wait twice as long, if not longer. I go here with my Aunt for lunch a lot as this is her favorite place, but the warm welcome we always get from the staff make it such a pleasure to come back."}
{"text":"This is one place I want to frequent when I crave for chicken.Food is great! Price, reasonable! Customer service is great, I mean really great! The place is neat and spacious! Can't wait for my second visit."}
{"text":"This is an updated review.  I originally went to chick-fil-A because so many of my friends are fans. I rarely eat fast food.  I had the Chicken BLT and thought \"meh\".  It was actually kind of dry.

I went back today and had just the basic chicken sandwich.  A LOT better.  Nice and moist.  Like all fast food it was way over salted and I'm spitting dust 3 hours later despite drinking water non-stop since then.

They really need to work on the fries.  They were very hot but still not crisp. Do they pull them out too soon because of the long lines because I would wait a minute longer for a littl crunch!

The best thing was actually Chick-fil-A could give Disney a run for their money on the whole \"happiest place on earth\" thing.  All of the employeers are squeeky clean, super nice without it seeming like it's forced.  Maybe knowning they get every Sunday off is something to smile about!"}
{"text":"First time at this chain. I love the Carrot and Raisin Salad--just like Mom used to make!
And the Charbroiled Chicken & Fruit Salad was really nice. The Berry Balsamic dressing goes perfectly. Would've been nice if they offered some sliced almonds with it but oh we'll...
Staff was incredibly friendly and efficient.
I'll be back for something sinful next time."}
{"text":"Chic-fil-a in general I would recommend, but this location can be a pain.  It is in a large plaza in a busy location that can get crowded easily and you may have trouble getting to if it's your first time and you are following a navigator.  I went through the drive through.  They told me specifically at the window that they were not handing me straws with my drink carrier because they were in the bag with the food.   Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I looked in the bag and there were no straws.  I had already driven away and was not near a chic-fil-a by the time I noticed.  I ended up parking and walking into a Burger King shamelessly grabbing straws and leaving.  I needed straws ."}
{"text":"Disappointed with this particular store. Nary a discount.... neither military nor senior. I do know this is an owner's choice, so I'll vote with my wallet and not patronize this store. The employees were nice, but seemed unconcerned. Food was delicious, as always. But knowing there are choices, I've made mine, and I'll encourage others whom I know to follow suit. Wouldn't be such a big deal for the owner.... but perhaps s/he doesn't care either."}
{"text":"I had a chicken breakfast biscuit from here on Tuesday. It was the nastiest, soggiest breakfast sandwich I have ever had.  It was also cold and old. The lemonade was delicious though. I will only go back for the lemonade."}
{"text":"Their food is over priced, but worth it all. Everything about this place is amazing. Their bathroom is spotless and the inside of this place is ridiculously clean. I love how all the sauces, napkins, utensils are right there for you instead of having to ask the workers. Omg! Their chick-fil-a sauce is so good!!! 

If ever you see a chick-fil-a, don't drive pass it. You all need to get a taste of the good life! This place is literally heaven."}
{"text":"I stopped for some chicken strips yesterday afternoon. This chain seems to have the best. This mall location is not up to par with the ones in the hoods. They were over cooked and dry and very small. I was ripped off. I don't like to complain so I just don't recommend and probably will not eat there again. Whoever put the food in the box should have know they were no good. You could tell by looking at them. 
I need to work on assertiveness or bring my wife as she would have unloaded on them."}
{"text":"Food is good but the drive-thru situation is simply a cluster f#%^.   Drive the extra few minutes to Stephanie street location where they have there act together. Two stars only for the food. Be prepared to wait an hour or more in drive-thru. I have been to location on Stephanie three  times and I was out in under 15 minutes.   Second visit was a joke too.   Get new people in the drive thru lane."}
{"text":"Nice place. Every seat and table was covered in crumbs and grease. Why does #1 deluxe say \"lettuce tomato cheese\" and #2 deluxe say \"lettuce tomato pepper jack cheese\", yet both come with pepper jack? Food was pretty good, part of my chicken was hard and inedible but still delicious overall."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst Chick-fil-A in the city of Charlotte North Carolina. The customer service is horrible, and every time I come in they get my order wrong. This is the only Chick-fil-A that I have ever been to in my entire life that I left there with horrible food, came back, got a refund, and went to McDonald's. I have never seen a Chick-fil-A in my entire life that makes me want to go and choose McDonald's over Chick-fil-A but this one is it. Please do better..."}
{"text":"My first experience to have a chicken sandwich tonight.  Still packed since the January opening.  Was impressed with the taste and quality although pricy.  Great staff with good organizational skills and lots of energy.  Orders are fast and efficient.  I will definitely come back.

DMV could learn some lessons from you.  \"How to process customers.\"  LOL!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time we came in because it wasn't super busy but the employees were almost crazy over the top friendly. The employees kept coming by our table asking us if we needed anything and refilled our drinks. To top it off they took a group photo for us. The place is very clean. They even have fresh cut flowers on each table. The food is great! I got a chicken salad and it was very fresh. Their sweet tea, milkshakes, and waffle fries are delicious. If it's your first time you have to get an original non grilled chicken sandwich and waffle fries. It's a great place to bring kids, there is an awesome indoor playground. Make sure to say thank you to the employees and each time they will respond with \"it's my pleasure.\" Overall a must!"}
{"text":"Ordered 5 sandwiches two with American cheese and three with Colby jack cheese on them. We also asked for extra ketchup considering we got four Fry orders. Three of our sandwiches came with pepper jack (which we didn't order) and the gave us 3 ketchups for four frys... Love the food but their service was lacking."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff, clean store, and very fast service, what more could one ask for.  I got the original Chick-fil-a sandwich and it was quite tasty.  I highly recommend a visit if you are driving by."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken and a pickle on a greasy bun.  Makes my hill-billy heart sing.  Wish we had more in Chicago"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A has a Daddy/Daughter date night Aug 21st & 22nd - 4:30 / 5:30 & 6:30"}
{"text":"I got pick up for my office and was really disappointed when I got back to the office and they forgot ALL of our French fries. When I called back they simply offered a refund for the fries, nothing extra for the inconvenience. Given the time you wait in line and for food, I would think they would ensure some sort of quality control to ensure that literally half of an order isn't missing, or offer a lil something extra when it is."}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwich. Great fries and a very nice staff. No wonder there is always a line! I wish they were open on Sundays, but I respect their decision to be closed on the Sabbath."}
{"text":"Went there to avoid the one on 83rd and Bell rd...bad move They literally ran out of chicken nuggets! The manager was rude! However the cashier was nice. My chicken sandwich was soggy. The waffle fries were pretty good. 2 out of five is fair! Manager needs to be trained."}
{"text":"Ate here 1st time. Im not one to notice this kind of things but I felt very uncomfortable when the cashier was looking at me wierd and trying to speak Spanish to me. It felt uncomfortable not welcomed at all. However the breakfast was nice very small and pricy but good."}
{"text":"We usually only stop in here for drinks and fries, but I can say that they have never messed up or order or given us sub-par food. 
The line here gets crazy long (as does the line for everything else in this area), but they are usually able to get through the customers quickly. I've never had to wait more than ten minutes total. 
The staff are also incredibly friendly, which is what makes me give this place four stars. They are always very nice even when the line is long. 
I'm sure there are other locations we could go to that would be less busy, but this one is closest to us and the great service keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"So, first time today ever going to Chick-fil-a. HUGE disappointment. Slightly overpriced but not by much. Flavor was like that of any other chicken sandwich I've had so it didn't stand out among the rest. Portions, HA!  You need child sized hands to hold a sandwich. Half way thru the sandwich and I only bit into chicken once, the rest was lettuce and tomato. 
Don't know what all the hype was about.
One star only for how quickly we got our meal despite the huge line of customers."}
{"text":"My chicken sandwich was okay.  It had a weird flavor.  I think it was judgement mixed with homophobia.  Very odd flavor for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Have to admit I never hit up a chick fil a until this year bc I got a card from work for nurses week and we got a free thing each month
May was market salad
June was a chicken wrap
July was a grilled chicken sandwich 

Have to admit I enjoyed every item better than most fast food places and the chicken is really good. Got my mother hooked on there salads too. Only down fall is the parking lot and it's in the miracle mile where everyone drives like a but! But now I will be a regular customer"}
{"text":"As with most all of these restaurants this place is clean and the staff is nice. The chicken is of course great and cooked well not like these restaurants in the north where it is cooked way too long."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! Not only do they have an amazing menu, but you can customize your order just about any way you want. I always add bacon to my Spicy Chicken Sandwich.

Customer service experiences are always a joy whenever visiting any Chick-fil-A and this location is no exception. Staff are kind and courteous and see always willing to serve and help.

I will continue to visit this location for many more chicken sandwiches to come!"}
{"text":"Over-priced over-processed food. 
I happened to be driving by early in the morning and there was no line in the drive thru so I decided to finally try Ckick-fil-A. I've been hearing so much about it, but frankly am very surprised. Meh?!? I got some mini chicken breakfast sandwiches, because mostly I wanted to try the chicken. The little chicken nuggets inside weren't bad, but barely a bite. The bread, or rolls or whatever they are, were ridiculously sweet and mushy. The \"hash browns\" are miniature tater tots, which honestly Sonic's are way better. I will say the coffee was pretty good, except even though they asked if I wanted cream and sugar, they gave me no stir stick so I had to wait until I got home. I also received no ketchup for my tots nor was I asked. I guess I just don't get it... the competition is much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed lunch here today. Linda the manager was so awesome. We had missed breakfast and my husband was very disappointed. She even gave him a gift card for breakfast on them. The staff was so nice both in the drive thru and inside. The food was hot and fresh and excellent as always. We can't wait to visit them again soon!"}
{"text":"This place isn't the greatest. But it's decent if you are in a kinda hurry. Drive thru can take a little."}
{"text":"The few times ive been to chic fila its been great! ok service, great chicken astonishing fries! Very good quality overall resturant im going back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"I live right near this location and I am consistently blown away by how well this location is run. Management here knows how to run a business.

1) The drive through is always super efficient feeling. I am always moving. 
2) The food is consistently top quality. I can't believe how good they make this stuff.

But today was the kicker. I showed up at 10:33am folks. That is 3 full minutes after breakfast was closed down for the day. Ordered breakfast and the guy told me there was not more breakfast. I looked at the time and realized I missed it by 3 minutes. As I was getting ready to order something else, he said let me check. He came back on the mic and let me know they had 2 sandwiches left from breakfast. I thought they were going to be old and less fresh, but they were fantastic. Made my morning."}
{"text":"The new Henderson location on Stephanie/Warm Springs was pretty good! 

The drive thru line was 30 minutes long but moved very quickly. Service was great and their food didn't disappoint. I love their breakfast the best but haven't had that yet. So since it was evening when I went, I ordered their chicken nugget meal. The chicken was hot and fresh! 
*Get some Polynesian sauce too. Nice touch to the chicken* 

Overall, it was worth the trip from Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some to-go from here for lunch. The lines were long but moved fast. The staff was friendly and they accurately got my order. Food was hot and fresh and tasted great. I love the variety of sauces for the chicken nuggets. Waffle Fry's are my favorite. Keep up the great service."}
{"text":"As much as I love CFA, they mwssed up my order twice in one drive-thru visit, ruining my previously perfect rating of them and, essentially sending me home hungry with food I couldn't eat. Seems like the quality of service has deteriorated since its open. FIX THIS PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"I just went here today and the service was great. I especially want to give a shoutout to India. She is a really cool waitress (or I don't know what you call it at chick-fil-A). She was very enthusiastic, kind and was very good at her job. Keep it up"}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwich ever. Definitely have it with the Chick-Fil-A sauce!! Also shoutout to Shirley for being a super nice server :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, always hot food, the lines can be long but they move quickly and sometimes they bring staff out to take orders by hand and you fly through the line. Its the best Chick Fil A I have been through. I go for lunch and also for breakfast as well. Always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I love chickfila and I was so excited to see they made one in Henderson! I went twice on opening day and both times there was excellent customer service. The staff is SO nice and genuinely wants to make sure they show respect and that your order is correct. I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"They're always so friendly!!i absolutely love this place, they have the peach peach shakes(limited time) and their fries are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Y'all already know. It's a Southern thing, brought out here to provide delicious fried chicken with a smile and a very subtle Southern Baptist sense of humility and service.
You'll NEVER have inconsistent quality. Your kids will love it. It's impossible to get sick of it. I grew up near the original, I will never live more than a mile from a branch of this staple."}
{"text":"Quick friendly drive through. Never have to worry about the order being incorrect. And always have a smile. Good job chick fil a."}
{"text":"Came here for community appreciation night and the line was out the door when I got there, around 5:45. I really didn't want long at all though. The employees really know how to handle a crowd, I was seriously so impressed. Food was as it always is; amazing."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Chick fil a is always one of my go-to places for any time of day. Good location, fast service, pretty much completely satisfied with our meal. 

Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because an employee came over to vacuum the area around where we were sitting, it didn't seem necessary and it was a little annoying. I don't hold it against them though. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-a although I don't agree with some of their principals. But can't keep a hungry chick away from chick-fil-a!!!! This restaurant was very clean and had friendly people working there."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get breakfast and the chicken has a sweet honey taste to it that you can't beat!"}
{"text":"My most disappointing Chick-Fil-A experience to date. The line in the restaurant was quite long at just after 11AM, but only one person was taking orders. My friend got her food right away, but she was halfway done with hers before I got mine. Apparently the first attempt was given to another customer. They DID bring me a free cookie to try to make it right."}
{"text":"Yummmm! That's all I can really say about this place. Service is always superb and extremely fast. Love this place, so happy one opened up east side Madison. I'll definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"*Deeee-Scuzzzzz-Tinnnnnng!  (Yes, disgusting!)*

So.... every time that we've attempted this particular chick filet, the food has been terrible!
Now... I know that the employees can't help the actual meat-to-fat/gristle ratio, but... what they can help are all of the CONS that I'm going to list below, for your dining (or avoiding) pleasure...

CONS:
Dirty dining area;
Filthy bathroom;
Gross condiment/napkin/drink area;
Soggy food products that have been either fried too long or sweated too much....

It was a baaaaaad experience!

I gave it a recent 2nd chance and it was more of the same....
Too greasy, soggy and just bad!   :("}
{"text":"**It's pretty bad**

This location is the the G level (basement) of the beautiful Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh's campus.
There's not much to say, otherwise.... so here goes the list:

PROS:  
The only \"real\" food in the Cathedral (other than the salad/wrap-type offerings from the cafe).

CONS:
Staff is terrible (rude, unprofessional, and irritated by the notion of having to do their jobs);
Food is always sub-par because its sitting under heat lamps or an undefined amount of time.

Because its laid out like a cafeteria (you get a tray, get your chicken and get fries if you want it on your own from the heating unit), there's not much else to talk about.

It could also just be my imagination, but I have stopped getting food here, altogether... I think their chicken is fattier than other Chick-Fil-A's.
I always get the chicken \"nuggets\" and this is the only location where fat/gristle is an issue 100% of the times ordered.
BLECH!     :X"}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwiches and soup, fresh and fast. Not basic fast food. Salads are kind of lame but everything else is perfect!"}
{"text":"Traveling around town and wanted to eat here.   Had to settle with eating in the mall.  Nice mall.  Food was good.  Price was right. Service was fast and friendly too."}
{"text":"Best fast food in the biz.  Store is very clean.

The service is OUT OF THIS WORLD good.  They hire a lot of young people, but they seem to get kids with good heads on their shoulders.  Everyone in uniform knows how to take care of a customer and does a great job of it.

When I want fast food, I go here and rarely go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Worst Chick-fil-A ever! I've never been to a terrible Chick-fil-a until I came to this one. 95% of the time they will mess up your order. The manager says it's because he has young workers, no it starts with the top. The salad is always brown, the fruit is old and vinegarry, long lines outside-no line inside. This is my neighborhood Chick fil A, I skip this one and go down to Rivergate."}
{"text":"I've had Chick-fil-A at many different locations before, and never had a bad experience. This one is outstanding, I ordered and got my ordered with less than 10 minutes even though there were lots of customers there. The employees here were super nice and friendly; they were really young too, they were either high school or college kids. I came around 6pm on Wednesday (08/09/17), they all deserved a raise including the kids that were cooking in the back.
I ordered a spicy deluxe chicken sandwich and an 8pcs of chicken nuggets. Everything was so good and fresh. The nuggets were so hot that I almost burned my tongue. Best restaurant at an airport that I've been too.
I would recommend this place to everybody."}
{"text":"My first time trying a chic fil eh and over all I really wasn't impressed with the cost or the meal.

I found the sandwich dry and no toppings of any sort and the biscuit was way too sweet.

I found afterward that they had some condiments off to the side but it would have been nice to see them before I ate the sandwich.

Over all though I love their position  on things and the devotion of what I read about their ceo

I might try lunch one day"}
{"text":"Every time I think about going to Chick-fil-a it's on Sunday, when they're closed.  Luckily, I remembered during a weekday and stopped by this location to grab a quick bite.

I ordered a Spicy Chicken Sandwich.

The Spicy Chicken Sandwich was just OK....nothing special.  The Chicken Nuggets were just OK too....but the Criss-Cut Fries were pretty good, above average.  I left full, but not satisfied....hence the 3 Stars.

Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"It was raining today, so we thought maybe we should try it because there will be less people. We were wrong, there was so much people for their lunch rush. I am happy I finally got to eat here. I wanted to avoid the craziness when they first open and have the police directing traffic. They had people directing traffic this time as well but it seems less crowded. They still have people directing traffic there because you know people are crazy drivers especially if it's raining. The people directing traffic was very friendly, they would smile and say good morning to you as you walk past them. I recommend going inside to order, it is a lot faster than the drive thru. Also you can order through their app and just pick your food up.

We ordered a regular chicken sandwich, spicy chicken sandwich, and nuggets. I like that the patty is white meat and it tastes a lot healthier. 
The 12 piece nuggets are small. It seem liked they cut 1 regular nugget in half. All the chicken items were hot and fresh. Our waffle fries are ok but a little soggy. To be honest they taste like in and out fries with less seasoning. I will want to try them again and maybe the food will be a little better. But right now I feel like the food is ok, beside it being a healthier option than McDonald's and taco bell."}
{"text":"Came in today with my family of three growing boys. Another awesome experience. Clean lobby bathroom and playground as well. The food was tasty as always. They even gave us table service with a smile... Ie refilled our drinks and cleaned off our table. Eat Mo Chicken!"}
{"text":"I never had a problem here. The food always taste fresh and came out in a timely manner. The people that work there are always nice. The drive through line could be long sometime especially during lunch and dinner hours but I'm usually through within 10mins. Maybe the food is fresher because I come during busy hours but even other time I come, the food and service was always very good."}
{"text":"OK, I have had my share of Chick-fil-a in many states but this location is reaching new heights.  Yes the flowers the music selections, but the people are what really makes it a pleasure. They must take some sort of happy test to get a job there, no ho hum waiters need apply. I go inside just to see there smiles. Oh, ya the chicken is as good as it gets too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I like any fast food more than Chick-fil-A.  And, I absolutely love the team at this location.  

When a restaurant is popular a lot of people ant to visit at all the same time.  This store can get crowded.  In fact, they have 2 auto lanes going at all the appropriate times, as well as the meandering walk-in line.  

The food, of course is awesome.  They have all my favorite bites, but it's the traditional Chick-fil-A Sandwich that keeps me coming back for more.  I'm also a huge fan of their fresh squeezed lemonade. It doesn't get any better than that.  I usually go for the diet because the sugar in the high octane version makes me bounce off the walls.  

Recently they discontinued their Coleslaw.  That was a huge disappointment. I used to top my sandwich with their slaw. I considered better than most homemade styles at local establishments.  Fortunately they made the recipe available to the public online. Yes, I've learned to make my own.  Thanks Chick-fil-A.

Best bet with this store is to avoid the drive-thru and head inside. Moves quite fast and they have a very nice eating area.  Use their App to order ahead if you can.  Makes everything much easier.

Kudos to the staff. Very helpful and always smiling. Love the food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat but after today I will no longer visit this location. I arrived at 10:21 and was told they were closed and I couldn't order breakfast or lunch. This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"My husband, daughters, and I love this location! They have great customer service as always and treat my daughters as valued customers too."}
{"text":"This location is always quick and friendly...  I used to come a lot more often, but I've slowed down considerably...  

I'm just going to go ahead and say it:  The grilled nuggets are not even worth the calories you save...  If you want to be healthy, just get a salad or eat somewhere else... I was completely underwhelmed... 

I love the lemonade here, much like all the rest of them... And of course, the fries are awesome..."}
{"text":"God bless you Chick-Fil-A !  It is & always will be my favorite \"fast food\" place! I was so excited when we FINALLY got one in Vegas, so I didn't have to take mini road trips to St. George anymore lol (totally worth the drive tho!). I will say that the service here isn't quite as amazing as it is in other states, but I chalk that up to it being a new style of service style & it takes time to find the right people for any new biz in a new town. Still love the food & have to have it at least once a week (& my family always gets it for bdays) ! NO SHAME IN OUR CHICK-FIL-A GAME!"}
{"text":"So the political views of this chain's leadership may not be all that agreeable, at least to me, but the food is always in agreeance with my belly, so I end up here quite a bit.

I'm a kid who moved here from Georgia who used to stockpile in Cali and freeze my sandwiches to reheat when I hit back to vegas, so I'm happy there's finally one right down the street from me.

Lastly, I just wanna say that I am overjoyed that they changed the barbecue sauce recipe back to the OG formula. Jesus Christ, the last one was horrible. Thanks for listening to the long-time fans who know what's up."}
{"text":"always delicious!!! And not to mention that they are a Christian company that is closed on Sundays and they don't support same sex marriage!! The lines were crazy yesterday due to the supporters of chick-fil-a's public post about not supporting same sex marriage. Went for breakfast at 6:30 and there were only 5 cars in front of me. Saw pictures through out the day for lunch and dinner and the lines were out the door! We go here a lot as the food is just great! They never let me down."}
{"text":"Usually love chick fila but the chicken egg and cheese on the whole grain bagel was blahhh today.  The biggest issue was the bagel itself was still cold and had a soggy wetness to it.  I am not sure if they are supposed to toast them but a cold soggy bagel with hot chicken and eggs made for a nasty experience today."}
{"text":"Yummmm; i went this morning at 630. No drive thru wait at all! Service was great and my chicken biscuit with pepperjack and chic fil a sauce was loooong over due!"}
{"text":"Great service but... their chicken noodle soup is gross. But only at this location. I got the soup twice now thinking it would be different the second time and it was not. Don't get it, trust me you will throw it away."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy the grilled nuggets from here with the sauce they serve, but sure what it's called but it's great."}
{"text":"Been here a lot but my last visit stood out, typically the staff are polite and greet you as you enter, smile, etc but this time I was greeted by Jason (I believe, was wearing professional dress so I'm guessing he's a manager) immediately as I entered with a huge smile on his face and an extremely infectious positive attitude and demeanor, I was a bit taken back to be honest because nowadays that level of politeness is just not heard of. He easily made my day and I love the energy that he had so if you see this, please keep that up!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food as is customary at most Chik-fil-a establishments. I had the cobb salad and mac-n-cheese which was very good. My family also enjoyed their experience. Only drawback was that my large lemonade had quite a bit of debris in it (i.e. seeds, etc). Other than that I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Chick fil a is a great spot for a freshly made, quickly served chicken lunch or dinner. Although not a fan of the standard chicken, the spicy chicken items are the best around. Waffle fries are always great, and the buffalo sauce would suit me in a cup with a straw.  Amazing sauce!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. Probably one of the best layouts for a fast food but it feels more homey than any fast food. The service is very hands on, extremely well maintained facility, the best playroom ever and the food is great. If you watch your diet, the salads are great. I am willing to pay a higher price for food when the service and product is his good."}
{"text":"Used the app for the first time. Super convenient and interesting.  This is a great place to go to if you're waiting at saint rose, because its right next door.

I ordered coffee late at night and they brewed me a fresh pot.  Talk about service."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today.  Without a doubt the worst chik fil a in the area.  Poor customer service, greasy chicken and soggy fries.  I won't return to this one."}
{"text":"I always have wonderful experiences at Chic-fil-a. This location is not an exception.  It has great service and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Chick Fil-A is great. I came today for the free breakfast they have been giving away for the whole month of August. That's right the WHOLE month. I love that they have to say nice things when taking your order makes you feel like they care even if they really don't. Overall the service was great, quick and efficient."}
{"text":"How come they are so darn nice?  Everyone was happy and truly pleasant. I don't know if it's just dumb luck that they find only nice people or maybe they just weed them out quickly. 
The chicken is tasty, but filled with calories. The waffle fries are better than all competitors."}
{"text":"Chick fil a always has great service no matter the location. This locations customer service was just as great as expected. I was greeted upon entry and the workers even brung me my food. I ordered the chicken soup and I was about to go get a spoon when one of the workers was already on her way to bring me one. What great customer service. 

Once I finished my food my tray was full of trash and another worker came and asked if she could clean my tray for me. Another excellent customer service! 

The food is always great for being fast food. It is on the pricer side for fast food but I don't mind paying for the great service! 

Their chick fil a sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"Like most people in the Vegas valley, I am not a Las Vegas native.  For years, whenever I went home to Pennsylvania I would lament over the fact that Chick-Fil-A said it would never come to Sin City.  Well fortunately for us, 'never' doesn't mean what it used to; and 2 of the 4 planned LV valley Chick-Fil-A's are finally open.  I chose to skip what I assumed would be sheer madness on Opening Day yesterday, but braved it for lunch today at about 1:30 PM.  

When I got near the Lowe's plaza on Eastern and saw police directing traffic, parking lot entrances coned off and portions of the lot taped off, I got worried.  But we just parked a little farther away to avoid the mess and walked.  There was a short line outside; but we got inside, ordered and sat down within five minutes; and had our food within another five minutes.  They were extremely well staffed with efficient and pleasant employees who kept the process moving like a well oiled machine.

When our food arrived, it was hot and fresh.  I ordered the Spicy Deluxe meal- $6.49 for a spicy chicken sandwich (breaded chicken breast, lettuce, tomato & pepper jack cheese), waffle fries, and a drink.  My friend ordered the 12 piece nugget meal with BBQ sauce- $7.99.  IMO, the food quality at Chick-FIl-A is very high for the price and a fast food restaurant.  The chicken breast was thick, moist, and tender.   The fries were potato-y yet still crisp.  And the nuggets have a hint of seasoning in the breading that was delicious.

*One note for those with peanut allergies- All the breaded chicken products are cooked in 100% peanut oil.  The fries are cooked in canola oil. 

One thing that always bugs me about Chick-Fil-A is that they don't have customer accessible drink stations.  If you want a refill, you have to ask at the counter.  I hate to do that, especially when it's busy and I would be taking their time away from people ordering.  I'm not sure why they are all like this, but I wish they would get with the times and install a lobby soda fountain, or better yet a Coke Freestyle machine.

I will definitely be back to this location and I'm sure I'll check out the Stephanie location too.  I've also heard rumor that one will be opening on LV BVLD and George Crockett along with a new Starbucks.  That's less than a mile from my office, so I'm sure I'll be picking up some Southwest chicken salads there in the future! 

Remember, that like all Chick-Fil-A's, this one is closed on Sundays.  All other days, they're open 6:30 AM-10 PM (breakfast until 10:30 AM)."}
{"text":"We didn't go inside, just drove through before heading to Elevation Church across the street, but this location looked huge inside! Drive through was speedy and the employee helping us was, as always, freakishly friendly and happy."}
{"text":"The food is great. This is my favorite restaurant. However why is it the one here does not offer military discount. Chick fi la other states offer it. So I'm confused. There is a big military community here. It was military appreciation day with chick fi la flyers. But I was told at this store that there is no discounts for military."}
{"text":"I opted to goto this location rather than the Eastern location as this one seemed to appear less busy. First off the shopping center's parking lot is manned by Henderson police, that has to be preparedness at its finest. I never thought police was necessary for the opening of a fast food chain but in this case it was or else the parking lot would have been a \"haute mess.\" Potentially even accident prone with the number of cars coming in and out. Secondly the drive thru line wraps around the back of the stores. Yes it is that long, kind of ridiculous in my opinion. Especially the fact your emitting fuels into the air when you could of walked inside. 

Anyway, those were some aspects I noticed off that bat. There was a little bit of a line outside with guided rope. It moved pretty quickly, we were probably in line for what felt like 20 minutes. The cow with the eat more chicken sign was also present which was a little bit of entertainment. Employees were taking orders while you wait so that expedited the process. Once we paid for our order it was only a matter of minutes until we were given our food. There was a swarm of employees working behind the counter- almost to the point it looks like they don't even have elbow room. Everyone pretty much knows what Chick Fil A tastes like so I'm not going into describing what I ordered. I just wanted to share my experience of the opening of a major fast food chain on the second day. Overall you can tell this company is use to such massive response on how well organized it was."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this chick fil a in the drive thru. My order is wrong. Every time I ask for mayo they give me ketchup. I'll ask for a four count they will put a three count in my bag. It's like they don't pay attention to what they are doing. I love going inside but they drive thru needs to step their game up."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! They are always wonderful to the customers especially when there are kids in tow. They bring you your order, refill drinks and are always very sweet."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience EVER!  Unless you want to go through the drive-thru, you'll never get a chance to eat.  The drive-thru customers are forcing everyone else out of the parking lot, and the management is doing nothing about it.  I tried three times to get to one of the available parking spaces, and three times I almost got my car rammed by someone who was desperate and in fear of losing a place in the drive-thru line.  Consequently, I went home without Chick Fil A.  I will never go back there because it is obvious that the management doesn't care enough to fix the parking problem."}
{"text":"Honestly, I love this place.... But you're telling me when I order 2 ice cream's and the cups are literally half full thats ok... In a world where your nickel and dimmed every day i mean... Just fill the ice cream cup up... Geeezzzzzzz. Disappointed yet again"}
{"text":"Just had a horrible experience here. I ordered dinner for my kids and I got a frosted coffee the person at the drive through handed me the frosted coffee with coffee dripping all over it, it proceeded to spill all over my clothes and my leather seats when I told her about this she took it back wiped it off then she handed it back to me and didn't even put the lid back on!!!so more spilled. When I complained a second time her and a redheaded kid that work there started laughing I stopped and called the shift manager when I told her what happened I could hear her laughing in the background and then she started laughing on the phone then I called the general manager Brian. I was impressed he picked up the phone at 8 PM and he acted like he really cared it's just horrible that this day in age people just don't care and take no pride in their work I go to this Chick-fil-A for breakfast and take my kids probably five times a week I will never return to this location ever again. Not that they care!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Unbeknownst to me, I showed up at this location for lunch on opening day. The drive thru line was crazy long so I decided to walk inside. I was in and out within about 5 minutes. The spicy chicken deluxe was as delicious as I remembered. Soft bread, tender chicken and friendly customer service. Chick-fil-a has never disappointed. I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Location has improved over the last couple months. Clean and good customer service. The air conditioning is finally fixed and the flies have not been as bad."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this location, more than I'd like to admit. Every. Time. We order these drinks in the drive thru: One Sweet Tea, One Half Sweet Tea/ Half Lemonade (Arnold Palmer), they ALWAYS get it wrong! Either one of us will get just sweet tea, just get unsweet tea, unsweet tea with lemonade, it's a disaster. If I order a different drink, with my husbands Arnold Palmer, they get it right, but never two different tea orders. 

Super frustrating. But we still love those gosh darn nuggets."}
{"text":"Tonight was a great night. Honoring veterans and active duty military and their family. Wasn't sure what to expect but what a great turn out. I won a 200 piece husky toolset, the food was great, but most of all the respect everyone showed to those of us who have served or are still serving In the military. I just want to say thank you"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Waffle fries are bland.  First time we went through the drive through.  They screwed up the order.  Called let them know.  They said they would fix the problem.  Went back ate inside the restaurant.  They screwed up the order again.  When we brought it to the managers attention, and they said it was to late to fix it! No pickles and a missing sandwich is a problem.  Pickle juice obsorbs into the chicken. Get your stuff together. When you are fixing a problem make sure you get it correct, and if it is wrong again fix it! Will not be back."}
{"text":"Yeahhhh FINALLY we have a Chick-fil-A in Las Vegas. Now I don't have to drive to California or Arizona to order me some yummy chicken strips with the yummy Chick-fil-A sauce. 

The main reason why I'm giving them 5 stars is because I'm very impressed with the company as a whole. Their customer service is always on point and no matter what location I'm at, all the employees are welcoming and you can tell they love working for this company. 

Tips/Heads Up
*This location is very busy (especially the drive thru) so make sure you plan ahead. Pulling in and out of this shopping center is tough and you can be stuck in traffic for a bit depending on what time you eat lunch/dinner.  
*The restaurant is pretty big so it's a great place to bring the whole family. 
*Location is on and off the I-15 freeway. 
*If you're staying at the Palace Station, just walk here to eat vs driving. It will save you a lot of time. 

OVER ALL, I totally recommend Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Cleanest restaurant I have ever seen. Great people and food comes out quick and hot. Bathrooms were especially clean and the offering of mouthwash I couldn't believe my eyes. Food is always fresh and love the fact that drive they doesn't take forever. You are in and out quickly and our orders are always right"}
{"text":"Used to be great, but service has slipped. Customer service doesn't seem as cheerful as they were. I've had missing food the last two times I went here. They say the 'my pleasure' part as if it's forced and I know it's trivial but it just made the difference for me when they seemed happier. Only Chick-fil-A I've ever been too with negative reviews. *make that 3 Times now they've missed food. See picture, this is how many fries they gave me in one of my containers"}
{"text":"Food wasn't good sandwich was  burned  and since it's a franchise owner really doesn't care about your concerns or complaints -will never go back to this location"}
{"text":"They were good before now with the grilled chicken sandwiches they are even better love the chick-fil-a house sauce dont think you can get better than them on a chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"I'm a relatively new fan to Chick-Fil-A. Those breakfast chicken minis and chicken nuggets are SO damn good that I've had to adopt Chick-Fil-A into my workweek lunch routine. 

This particular location is relatively new and deluxe for a fast food joint. The people who work there are very courteous, which at first was a little offputting because I felt like I was getting too much service for a fast food place. Something that I really like about Chick-Fil-A is that they have a fun condiment bar. It's not just ketchup, straws and napkins. They keep a couple types of mayo and mustard packets up there, as well as Purell handwipes (way cool), and even plastic placemats for children--which brings me to my one gripe. 

The place is teeming with children. Screaming children. And lots of them. When I was there last week, I couldn't wait to leave the place because it was so loud and the children were so annoying. Luckily there is an area off to the side where you can sit away from the play place, but that's assuming that nobody with kids sits over there. Word to the wise, if you don't like being around babies and kids, go through the drive thru."}
{"text":"There was a long line and i hesitated to get in it.  I wanted a chargrilled chicken sandwich with bacon so I got in line at the drive thru.  The line went down fast.  My sandwich and fries were good. The tea could have used more sugar.  It was more like ice tea."}
{"text":"Love Chick Fila Costwold!  The food is always hot and the staff is great!!"}
{"text":"Total guilty pleasure. My blood pressure probably jacks up faster than my ankles swell whenever I eat here, but it's just so stinkin good. My kids like the chicken nuggets too, and I like that I can get a cup of actual fresh fruit (not a baggie of apples) with their meals. 

Last visit was this past Friday, and while the food tasted as chickeny and salty as ever (waffle fries, droooool), two things could have been different - the staff was very attentive with me, but what was up with sitting around and talking while other people were obviously waiting to place an order? Let's call it an 'area for improvement', because that is not my normal experience here. I'd hate for others to think it's not good and not return.  

But for the love of Sasquatch, please, please, please clean and deodorize the kids' play area. One of my kids, the one who asked me to NOT roll the window down after I heard a distinct fart from the back seat, stopped playing and said, \"Mommy, it smells yucky in there.\" Honestly. :P"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting in the drive through and have been for 25 minutes. Can't get out....with this new double drive thru. Food is good, service is always above average , but the new drive thru idea was NOT a good 

Update: once again I've been here for a half hour in the drive thru. The order takers are super slow. Order boards would be faster. The traffic situation also leaves a lot to be desired. Yes really hard to get in and out of this parking lot."}
{"text":"So good but duh it's chick what would you expect it to be ??? Lol I'm from California originally and are Chick-fil-A's are things of Legend I'm happy to report Las Vegas locations are no different at least this one"}
{"text":"The manager is amazing and the employees are kind and polite. Love eating here. The food is always timely, well cooked, and delicious."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast this morning on their first day of being open to the public.  Fresh, clean restaurant and service with a smile.  I opted for the lower calorie egg white grill while hubby did a more standard bacon, egg and cheese biscuit.  Both were delicious and about what you'd expect from a fast food restaurant.  Coffee was hot and we were offered a refill while we had our breakfast.  We were also pleased to see that they accept Apple Pay.

We connected to the free wifi but it seemed not to be working right and ended up having to disconnect and use cell data to browse the web, etc.  We run into this often with wifi at restaurants so unsure if it's us or a common occurrence.  

Looking forward to trying out lunch and dinner sometime.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dropped our car off for service at the auto dealers up the street and decided to walk to this location and have a quiet breakfast. As other reviewers state staff was friendly and service was quick. Food was up to the typical Chick-fil-A standard. 

The reason for the one star is they have to get a grip on the homeless population that comes in and out of the restaurant. While here there were at least three that came in, got water, went into the bathroom for an extended time and then left!  Help the homeless seek out the appropriate resources, treat them respectfully but stop the baths in the bathrooms!

Not a Chick-fil-A I can recommend to friends and family. Thanks for the same quality, friendly staff, but no thanks to filthy bathrooms and the homeless inside."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Chick-fil-A for a long time and was happy when they arrived in Nevada. This location was great at first. Sad to say...not anymore. The food quality is hit and miss and the customer service has gone downhill. Even though this location is about 2.5 miles away from me, I would rather drive to the Eastern location. 
It's unfortunate that the West coast locations don't have the same customer service as GA and TX."}
{"text":"I always go to chick fil a and was disappointed so much with this one that i won't be going back. After receiving our food that came out about 2 mins after we ordered, we noticed it was undercooked. We asked them to throw in our nuggets a little longer, yet they looked the exact same when we got them back. The nuggets tasted rubbery and not very warm. Not only that, a couple of teenagers overheard us talking to the employees and out of no where, decided to made rude and immature remarks about us wanting our food cooked. Terrible service, food, and environment. So disappointed and never going back."}
{"text":"'My pleasure' is something you will consistently hear at this location, and so do I take great pleasure in devouring everything on their menu from the chicken strips to the grilled chicken bites, and chicken tortilla soup.

What makes their fast food concept so special? The chicken. It is so juicy and fresh.   Even the breaded entrees are not overshadowed by the hard and crusty layers of breading other ff chains glob on - on efforts to save on the protein. Here you get generous portions, each one delivering taste and freshness. Especially the grilled chicken has a tooth some and juicy flavor.

What u love most about the sides? Kiddos get a plethora of fruit in a fruit cup ranging from crisp apples and blueberries to tangy sweet mandarins.

The lemonade virtually tastes like a fresh squeezed lemon with simple syrup and I am consumed by how amazing it tastes.

The most terrific thing? It is so kid friendly that twice a month they have an hour or so of activities for kids. These include a scavenger hunt or art contests, art projects, face painting, and more. The wow factor is that is is absolutely free.

The staff are consistently friendly and engaging, they even bring your order to the table.

I come her about twice a month with my girls, my 5 year old asks to go every day! 

And yes, as far as fast food goes, they can't do any better."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A has my most favorist (it's a word) fries! I love the waffle fries they serve...yum! 

Chick-Fil-A has bar none the best service of any fast food chain that I know of! They serve the food to your table, they will come clean up your sloppy mess after your meal, and even offer to get you a drink refill! 

I love the chicken sandwiches.

Another hidden gem is the \"handspun\" milkshakes... SO GOOD!

I wish they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"First time eating here, was not disappointed!! The staff was very friendly and organized.. There is small play area inside for children.. Food was hot & fresh!!"}
{"text":"We moved here from Kentucky 4 1/2 years ago, and every time we go back we drive immediately to Chick-fil-A. I am so stoked that Las Vegas finally has this phenomenal chicken spot!

I always get the number one. Whenever going to a chain of any sort I always go with their main item-as that should be the best offering. You cannot go wrong. The barn is soft the fried chicken is juicier than ever conceived possible and yet crispy at the same time. Each sandwich comes with a pickle on it which adds the perfect amount of kick. I adore the waffle fries, not too greasy perfectly salted and delightful in every possible way. My favorite sauce offering is the honey mustard. I always asked for extra so I can keep it at home.

The staff here reminds me of Kentucky, in the southern hospitality type of manner. Always smiling, ready to serve you in anyway you need, and genuinely happy that you have come to visit. We will continuously come back to Chick-fil-A.  It's wonderful to have a small piece of Kentucky here in beautiful Las Vegas, and our taste buds are ecstatic about it!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come here all the time. Granville always provides us with the best service. We consider him a Chick-fil-A best friend.. lol."}
{"text":"Went to Chick-fil-A this morning hoping to grab a quick breakfast. As it is a holiday, we were informed they were not serving breakfast. No big deal, we order lunch instead. While waiting, another patron was causing a scene. He was upset about them not having breakfast available and was impatient when he learned one of their fryers had gone down, causing slightly slower service. Personally, I think the guy deserved a smack upside the head for his behavior. He was throwing a total tantrum, and yet Aaron (who i assume is the manager) never strayed from professionalism. He refunded the patron's money, gave him free meal, and tried to remedy the situation to the best of his ability. However the guy was not happy and continued to carry on like a toddler being told \"no\" for the first time. It was pathetic to watch him carry on in this manner, but the way Aaron and the rest of the staff handled it was very impressive. Way to go team, keep being awesome!"}
{"text":"Overall a pretty decent fast food joint. The chicken sandwiches are always hot,  but fries are hit or miss. Service is always overally friendly (count how many times you can get them to say my pleasure for a good laugh) but never rude and always relatively quick. Ample parking but the lot itself is a bit of a cluster."}
{"text":"Yeah ok it's just a chicken sandwich, but is soooo good. Love this place although it's always packed during the day an yes the orange cones are out. It's a little drive from the house but hey worth it. The food is always fresh an good an the service is always great even in 108 degree weather there still smiling for you. I love the spicy chicken sandwich an the regular chicken as well. The wraps are pretty good too. It's quick business as well. I love how when it's busy they take your order an you pay right away. Wow drive up get your food an your on your way home. Prices are very reasonable for combos or if you want just the sandwich. I like that they are closed in Sunday's which gives everyone a day to do their thing whatever that may be. So head over an get yourself something. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"they are great we go at least once a week for lunch and they are so friendly! love the spicy chicken!"}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food often but loving chick fil-a. I have one close to my house and was told I have to try it. Glad I did! it's so yummy and the food comes out hot and quick. I don't go through the drive thru though. that's too crazy busy for me! This is fast food but somehow doesn't feel as bad as other places. Or maybe I'm just convincing myself so I don't feel guilty eating there!"}
{"text":"Thank U baby Jesus, I have been waiting for Chick-fil-A to come to Las Vegas since I moved here three years ago. I am beyond ecstatic that they're finally opened, say they need open a few more. I grew up on Chick-fil-A so I think you can't go wrong with anything that you get waffle fries, Chick-fil-A sandwich, Polynesian sauce, Chick-fil-A sauce, sweet tea, lemonade, and their chicken tenders are all absolutely phenomenal choices. Their milkshakes are amazing as well as their brownies. If you have never had Chick-fil-A I suggest you go ASAP! It's the perfect place to take your family for lunch! They have a nice little play area for the kids! They are closed on Sundays which I think is absolutely amazing but that has nothing to do with the food of course. 

So basically get out and get you some  Chick-fil-A!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been hooked on Chick Fil A ever since I had my first taste of a chicken nugget sample at a long forgotten mall food court.  So, when I moved to AZ I was concerned that I would not be able to get my fix - what if there were no locations nearby?  Lucky me, this location in the Scottsdale 101 center can take care of my chicken sandwich and waffle fry cravings.  Well, except for Sundays, when all CFA locations are closed.

This location is nice and clean, and service is efficient both in the restaurant and at the drive through - my orders have always been correct which is nice.  They aren't stingy with the condiments, either.  Want to try more than one type of sauce?  No problem!  Not like some other fast food places I won't name where customers are asked exactly how many catchup packets are needed.  Seriously? 

I usually stick with the basic Chick Fil A Chicken Sandwich and waffle fries.  If I am feeling a little wild & crazy I will ask for lettuce & provolone cheese as well (tasty!).  If I want to pretend I am being healthy, I will get the Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich, which is not breaded and is served on a wheat bun with lettuce & tomato.  Either option is tender and juicy.  I have tried a couple of the breakfast items as well - the chicken minis (little chicken nuggets served in a slightly sweet mini bun) and the chicken biscuit sandwich are both good, as are the hash browns (quarter-sized tater tots - yum!)"}
{"text":"Quality food.  A bit slow tonight on service.  

Sort of weird seeing so quiet here, especially on Tuesday which is Family Night."}
{"text":"Dear Chick-fil-A,
Stop squeezing 4meals into one bag. I'll pay extra for two bags. It's ridiculous that your food is to rim of the bag."}
{"text":"The staff is outstanding here. Food is always great. You can never go wrong with Chickfila!!!"}
{"text":"Always great food! Order here for all my employee meetings. It's the only place everybody agrees on. Keep it up! Thank you"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is always at least 4 stars in my book, as we don't have it in Vegas.  We're sinners, we don't deserve it.  Pulled off to this Chick-fil-A for my out of town fix on the way to Arizona, and my 12 piece nugget was one of the worst I remembered.  I don't know if it was because I was in Goodyear or because they were just closing, but they were too crispy.  Still enjoyable, but man it was not the CFA experience I desired."}
{"text":"Chickfila is one of my favorite fast food places to go. The line are always long but good thing you must wait for."}
{"text":"Love the new location very convenient. I haven't experienced the long lines that others have it's been pretty quick always! Never an order wrong! So I'm liking it. Minus this morning I went for breakfast 9:00 am and found a French fry in my hash browns! Which made me think do they start cooking lunch at 9:00am or is this left over from last night wait couldn't be from Last night cause it's Monday and last night would've been Sunday (closed). Hmmm pretty gross to think about, how often is oil changed?!?"}
{"text":"Once again I'm VERY disappointed in this location!  I'm in the drive thru on a Saturday at 8 AM with two cars in front of me.  The lead car is waiting at the pick up window  more than 10 minutes.  Apparently that's OK.  So two cars behind and ALL food is ordered from breakfast menu.  Nothing special and yes after taking my $30.00 I'm asked to pull around.  So why did I return to the same let down?  I dunno.  The Service is MUCH better at Gilbert and the 202 location.  It's a head scratcher how two physically close locations are ran so vastly different from one another.  Drive the distance where that store appreciates their customers!!!

By the way I pulled to the front and waited.  8:30 is when I pulled around and food was finally brought out at 8:45"}
{"text":"I don't know how all these restaurants have such amazing customer service! Every single one is clean, the customer service is 5 star and everyone goes above and beyond to help you. Literally my favorite fast food place by far! I come here twice a week and it's good every time. They haven't ever messed up one of my order, ever!"}
{"text":"This location, by far, exceeds all other Chick Fil A's.  They are timely, accurate and friendly.  I have never been asked to pull around and wait for my food.  This is huge to me, as this is why I no longer support the San Tan location.  This location is not as geographically desirable from my home, however due to the fantastic service, I make the journey.  I appreciate the honesty, friendliness of the staff.  Our food has always been correct, hot and tasty."}
{"text":"More often than not something is gonna be subpar. Whether the coffee isn't ready or the lemonade machine broke. You will be inconvenienced."}
{"text":"Have been going to this Chick-fil-A for a loooong time. Learned some thing new today--I have serious food allergies ...Had a conversation with Sarah (who recognized us as a steady customers)and she advised me that they could used their crispy chicken--instead of grilled--in their wraps...salads and other menus.  Another reason to go there now--more of their fantastic chicken combos that I can enjoy--The crispy chicken was chrisp , the veggies were fresh and plentiful.. The tea was even fresh...  As I have come to expect: service was excellent; friendly and speedy. Strongsville Chick-fil-A rocks..."}
{"text":"Their food is great, but I wouldn't \"dine-in.\" The staff is great, it's the people who dine here are the problem. Every time I've ate inside, I've had bad experiences with the customers. I'm just trying to eat and enjoy my food, leave me alone!"}
{"text":"I loooooove Chic Fil A breakfast. I stop here sometimes during the weekend for a spicy chicken biscuit and hash browns. Yummy, high quality food! I don't know what's in their special sauce, but it's truly addictive. 

This location has great service (like all Chic's I've been to!). The drive through gals are always friendly, fast and efficient.

If you're in the area, definitely try out this Chic Fil A!"}
{"text":"My first time ever trying CFA and it was bomb af! My bf told me we had to try it so we did. Drive-thru line was insane! So we went inside and the line was much shorter. We decided to eat outside because it was packed inside, but aside from the actual food, which was pretty darn good, the best part was it came out really fast!! Makes me want to come back and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Boy is this review gonna be different...

First off, Chick-Fil-A's North Olmsted location is awesome and that's exactly what reviews on Yelp, (or anywhere) should focus on. The food is perfect, the prices are fair, the service is amazing and the place is spotless. That's it... FIVE STARS! 

Second, this national chain got into a debate that unfairly paints them as unfair, homophobic and even supportive of denying equal rights. The company has had a very public Christian persona since it's founding, closes on Sundays, gives more dollars to charities (proportionately) than ANY other chain, pays their people more than any other chain, provides more career opportunity, college tuition, grants, scholarships and so... than any other chain. Their CEO was asked HIS opinion... HIS understanding of the definition of marriage. HE said, as would most people today, and as all cultures, all religions in every corner of the world for ALL of recorded history, that he \"believed in the biblical definition of marriage.\" For that, these \"tolerant\" fools protest, boycott and write BS reviews on Yelp! Thereby hurting the bottom line of a company that gives tens of millions to charity, deprives the hardworking Franchisees and hurts all of this company's employees... Even the gay ones! This chain never refused service to gays, purchases from gay vendors or even denied applications from gays. The CEO said what he believes and this \"TOLERANT\" bunch of thugs tries to run them out of business? Shame on all of you who engage in this extortion! More people are hurt by these actions than you can imagine. 

BTW... The boycott didn't work so well... People came out in droves, waited in lines for hours and supported the chain to the point that they enjoyed their greatest sales efforts. Meanwhile, people grew to think that the \"gay mafia\" is simply a bunch of intolerant idiots. 

The Census dept came out and said (as of 2010) that gays represent 1.8% of the population...  This is all blown out of site. Can we just focus on how well the restaurant and it's hard working employees do their jobs? It's very unfair of Bob A. and Xela N. to impose their views on the rest of us Yelpers and cause harm to a wonderful group of people. And don't come back with the \"civil rights\" thing... Gays have the same right to marry someone of the opposite sex just like the rest of us do. Most importantly in this forum... Gays have the same rights as well do to visit a restaurant and write an honest review."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with fries and I tried their yogurt parfait with granola. Everything was delicious and we will definitely be back. My only concern was the drive thru worker, I couldn't really understand what he was saying, he seemed overly enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Very tasty and quite enjoyable if you are looking for quick food that tastes really good.  They  have a very wide variety for their menu and they have a lemonade type shake that was really good as well.  

Came here for lunch the other day and I was very pleased."}
{"text":"So I order a chicken sandwich with no Pickles. At the drive thru I check and it has pickles. I point this out and ask for a new sandwich. Was a quick turn around and I though nothing of it. I get home, take the top bun off and its covered in Pickle seeds. They didn't make me a new one, just took the pickles off. Now how a restaurant should handle an issue like this imho."}
{"text":"This was my first Chick-fil-a experience and I have to say I was pretty impressed for a fast food chain.

The service was very friendly and quick. As soon as an employee saw a customer standing nearby looking at the menu they immediately stopped what they were doing and jumped onto a register.

On my first trip here I went with the deluxe sandwich. Not knowing how things worked here I was surprised when they offered me sauce after I had placed my order. They had a range of choices of which I chose ranch. I figured this was for the fries to dip them, but I quickly figured out that its because their sandwiches do not come with anything on them. 

There was a little bit of a wait for my order which the employee let me know that they were waiting on fries for me. I don't mind waiting a minute or two to get fresh fries. The chicken must have been quite fresh too as I had to let the sandwich cool a bit before I could dig in. 

The fries were nice and crispy and hot and the sandwich was delicious. 

On my second trip here I went with the spicy deluxe sandwich. The chicken wasn't quite as fresh, but it was still a tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"We just came here for their \"dress like a cow\" day for our free entrees, but we frequent chick fil a couple times a month. We had two people dressed as cows and one without, so we ordered two salads and one chicken nugget. The nugget was supposed to be the only item we paid for because they take off the most expensive items, but she accidentally took off the nugget and one salad. I quickly brought up the mistake and the manager came in and apologized to me, which he didn't have to do, and fixed the problem. I ended up leaving without paying anything. I always have a great experience at chick fil a. Great customer service and food. We love them!"}
{"text":"Everyone here was very friendly and provided excellent customer service. I ordered the sausage and egg breakfast sandwich meal. My biscuit was very crunchy and ended up falling apart after a few bites. I wished that the sausage would have been cooked a little longer, it was very pale and not very hot. My egg was fine until I bit into the middle and the egg was still raw. The hash brown bites were way too salty, I would never get those again."}
{"text":"First I never received my sauces. So I go inside to get them. Then I take my 30 minute commute home and open my food to find it was the wrong order completely. I call & the manager said I can either bring it back or he can take my information down. I said I was already 30 minutes away. Honestly I should've just asked for a refund. Because he took my information down and said a manager would be in touch in a few days. No one called me. So I call back only to have someone avcuse me of lying. She said she would have to look into it. Then after finding I was telling the truth. She asked me to call back & which I did. Then I was told I would be sent something through the mail. Which I never received and the last phone call with a manager took place 3 weeks ago. I will never go back to this location. They should've just given me a refund for their mistake. They made a small situation so much worse."}
{"text":"I keep meaning to review this location, and now I'm finally doing it! Yay!

The people who work here are always so nice and wonderful. So much so that if there happens to be a mistake made here or there (rarely happens), I don't mind at all. They are just so helpful and happy!

It's a popular hang out for parents and kids in need of tiring out, so we've been enough times with other parent friends to see just how much the employees here care. They're quick to clean up any messes, and I love how they go around and check on everyone. 

The floor managers are always my favorites. Some kids in my acquaintance were going through a rough time and became upset during one of our visits, and a floor manager rushed over with little stuffed cows to give them, and they couldn't stop smiling after that. It was such a sweet gesture that it made me tear up a bit. Even now thinking back to that day!

If ever I'm craving Chick-fil-A, I always make sure to come here! :)"}
{"text":"Of course this franchise has been around for years...but this particular store just opened a few months ago and I just wanted to say. It has the best Spicy Chicken Sandwiches in the Charlotte area!  I do think a few more toppings would be great but spiciness of   theirs is just perfect! 
I like this locations the best!"}
{"text":"My dad and I split the 30 piece chicken nuggets. I love the food here! Tastes like real chicken!"}
{"text":"I visited this location on September 30 to have lunch. I was wearing a jacket with the logo of the University of Michigan (my alma mater) on it. When I approached the counter, the manager instructed his employee to \"charge him an extra 10% for being a Michigan fan\". 

When I stated that I would be happy to spend my money elsewhere, the manager replied, \"Yeah, you can take it right back to Michigan.\" 

I have never experienced such rude and unprofessional customer service in my life, nor have I ever seen a manager--in any industry--exercise blatant contempt for a guest. I reported this incident to Corporate, and posted on the store's Facebook page to bring this to the attention of the general manager.  

Otherwise, the staff is usually friendly and helpful (sometimes overly so).  But I will not be returning to this location.  There are just too many other places that are happy to accept my money."}
{"text":"May not be the best location but they know how to get the cars through the line quickly so I never worry when I'm on my lunch hour. Always great service."}
{"text":"My order is always wrong the lines are too big inside and outside and I ordered a large ice cream and was out almost 4$ and it looked like a sample. The drive thru is always a 20 min wait so is inside."}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A is located in the Mesa Riverview complex. It is always busy. The parking lot is clean. My only complaint is the way that the drive-thru is set up. The arrow is confusing, set up in the middle of the median, so it's hard to tell if they mean the first turn, or the second. Well, if you take the second, you hit a dead end and have to do an Austin Powers turn sequence to go back.
The staff is always friendly, and my order has always been correct. My favorite lately is the grilled cool wrap with the avocado lime dressing. Not over-filling, always fresh, and super tasty.
The quality of Chick-fil-A is always consistent. Sometimes we all need and appreciate a little consistency. Thanks Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Dear Stan Stepp, Owner/Operator:

It breaks my heart to say this but THIS Chick -Fil- A needs some major help.  I am writing this as a means for improvement, I love this corporation and have never had a bad experience (trust me I tried to think of one). 

I walked into your store at 11:35. Not even lunch rush yet, and immediately walking through the doors saw the frustration the shift leader was having. Not only with her being rude with her fellow employees but being short with the customers.  Acting as if everyone was inconveniencing her. I would give the benefit of the doubt, however this is the second day in a row I went here (my car is being worked on next door) and she exhibited the same behavior. Unacceptable.  

My cashier was nice, friendly and was happy she was serving me. But when she had a question for the shift leader, you received a short answer and snark remark.  My brows about fell out.  

The wait was far too long for that time of day. And very disorganized with food coming out, lots of errors I witnessed. My food came out late but was good, just as it should be. 

Just wanted to let you be aware Stan so you can make a minor adjustment in certain areas. People go here for the service and food. For me, more the service and friendliness. I also wrote in on a comment card. 

Your caring customer,

Chris"}
{"text":"I don't typically review fast food chains as my expectations from them are average at best. But this place really blew that expectation away when i went in for a quick dinner/supper bite here last week. We ordered a Spicy and a Regular Chicken sandwiches. Both of chicken patties were freshly fried, extremely moist and flavorful and played beautifully with the bun and other accompaniments!! To make our trip even better was the exceptionally polite and professional customer service!

We enjoyed our \"fast food\" experience so much here that this will now become our go to grub for a quick burger bite :)..."}
{"text":"Holy moly!! Sooo darn good- chicken sandwiches (spicy or regular) have a tang like no other & the Polynesian & Chick Fil A sauce with the waffle fries just puts the meal over the moon of yumminess!! Sweet tea or lemonade is perfection! If you haven't- go... you must try it now!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this location for the most part.  I usually go in Saturday morning's with my son.  The girls that are in early are always so nice and happy.  They always get our food correct.  I do love the Arnold Palmer with sweet tea, but it can sometimes be more on the bitter lemonade side but the staff are always are happy to fix the drink to my satisfaction.  The kid's play area is clean and the equipment is always in working order.  I like that I can see the play area clearly.  It allows me to be a little more relaxed when I am eating and reading at the table.  Any time we go inside for lunch, it is slammed and hard to find a seat so be prepared to go in before the lunch rush.  

The food doesn't disappoint each time we go.  I have only had one \"negative\" (if you can call it that) experience where my food was not prepared correctly.  It was due to the cashier being told by another work how to input the order I had already ordered because it wasn't rung up under the correct order name.  I felt as if the cashier that stepped didn't handle the situation professionally by scolding the employee on how to properly input a \"special\" order.  Other than that, this place is pretty consistent.  The food is always fresh and the customer service is usually on point."}
{"text":"Decided to finally see what the hype is about. Waited in the drive thru over an hour for a Cobb salad with grilled chicken. Total fail Chick-Fil-A, total fail. I think it's a Cobb salad? No toppings other than chicken, breaded chicken that is. And then they throw in some granola and nuts? I know it's busy, but I waited patiently...forever...and I paid almost 11 bucks for a salad and a diet Dr Pepper...can you just get my order right? Not like going back is really an option. 

And apparently the nice employees were there for opening, judging by comments. Lots of \"managers\" I'm guessing just standing around with their noses in the air in the drive thru, everyone had a bit of an elitist attitude. I'm not Trump, but you make chicken, no need for the attitudes like you are better than someone else, and you can't get my order right. FAIL! Not impressed"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is a great grab and go or sit and dine fast food. It is my favorite in town. The people are all so friendly. They have options from Soups and Salads to Chicken Nuggets and Mac-n-cheese. I highly recommend the Cobb salad with grilled chicken. The diet lemonade is enjoyable also. The only complaint I have is that the kids play section is usually really germy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at this Chick-Fil-A this weekend and I liked it. She eats there all the time and has been trying to get me to go and I wasn't disappointed. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and some chicken tenders. Lemonade was awesome. More importantly the service was great. Everyone seemed to have such a great attitude which I appreciated. The person at the registrar was Camry and she was very helpful. We told her we were going to the movies and she told us where the theater was and how to get there quicker. I appreciated that she took the time to tells. My wife was impressed with how kid/baby friendly this place is. From diapers in the bathrooms to Cheerios in small cups for hungry kids, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"This place was great, I got the little chicken balls. They were very greasy and messy just like I like it. Also make sure to get it with the buffalo sauce!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is leading the industry with excellent customer service and great-tasting food! I come here regularly and always love the food! The lines are long for a reason, people."}
{"text":"I recommend trying their breakfast! Absolutely and unexpectedly amazing! This location has only been here a few months, but it is totally one of my favorite places to eat. I probably eat here 3 times a week on average. This location is way better than any Chick-Fil-A I have seen, and the employees are more friendly than usual.  

Unfortunately, I always feel like I hope I don't see anyone I know there ... their stance on gay rights is embarrassing.  I'm a closeted Chick-Fil-A customer.  (My friends don't know I'm in love.)"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly, and can you say YUM?!!!  LOVE Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Can you ever say anything bad about a Chick-fil-a?! Well guess what we will not start here!! This place is great!!! The employees are so pleasant whether you utilize the drive thru or dining in services ! I've never had a bad experience!! 

Everyone is so accommodating and willing to help. This little old was so sweet; coming to the table every so often to ask if we needed anything. Another employee brought a dine in customer her food to the table she was seating at. I can't quite remember this type of service at a fast food restaurant. Pretty cool to me!

Be mindful, lunch time is always very busy! But the lines move very fast! They will definitely get you in and out with a big happy smile on their face! And you'll definitely leave with one on your face too!"}
{"text":"I've dined in and ordered in the drive thru and both time were excellent experiences! The dine in experience here was superb they actually brought the food to the table. I was really surprised! Someone also came by to refill our drinks and even threw away the trash we were finished with. The drive thru experience was great as well they got our orders right and they were happy satisfying the customer, ending every request to them with \"My pleasure!\". I couldn't ask for anything more. And the food is always delicious I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yo this Chick-fil-a is awesome. Special shoutout to Jeremy the manager. This dude hooked us up with 2 full meals for free. We're a touring band on the road and this helped us out so much. Jeremy was so kind and really blessed us."}
{"text":"What can I say except that I love this place. The food is good, the staff is friendly, the place is clean. 
 Even though it's fast food and deep friend in a billion calorie oil... I still feel better feeding my family REAL chicken instead of the creepy chicken paste McDonald's uses... O.o"}
{"text":"The WORST location I've been to! 

I had hair in my food so I called and they stated they would replace it. The \"manager\" asked could I return the food for proof lol! I said no- I'm at work however I will take pictures. 

Not sure who hired the management staff but this is the worst service ever. I'll drive 15 mins to go to another chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Superior quality food along with superior quality service wow what a restaurant. Name one other fast food restaurant where they come and give you free refills on your beverage. The consistency of products has been excellent year-over-year, right along with the outstanding people that they hire."}
{"text":"Chicken.  Would you like that with a side of chicken?  Oh wait, more chicken!

Chick-fil-a certainly has a single minded purpose--your primary options are going to be chicken breast (breaded or grilled), on a bun or no bun, and  waffle fries.  The difference from most fast food places is that the chicken breast is actually a chicken breast rather than a \"nugget\" or re-formed patty. 
As a result of this obsessive focus, service is extremely speedy. As an example, I got a coupon for a free breakfast item. At the drive through, it took about 2 extra minutes at the window for my biscuit sliders so they gave me an extra slider.  One bummer about the process is that the food is immediately put inside a bag or box; as a result, any sort of crispiness from either the chicken or waffles fries is lost due to the steam.  I recommend the kids' meal as the most efficient meal; I honestly think the size is adequate, and apparently there's a secret deal where you can refuse the kids' toy and get a tiny ice cream serving instead.

The cleanliness and customer service is A+.  All of the employees are very polite and efficient.  An employee is always circulating around the restaurant, ensuring that all tables are cleaned with a disposable wipe, taking trays, and helping with any requests like refills or extra sauces.

Overall, Chik-fil-a good example on how to improve on drive-through joints."}
{"text":"Worst Chic fil a in the country ...and there is only one bad one.. This one ... Service is slow to non existent.. Food is cold.. Lemonade machine is always broken ...they run out of food regularly...and for some reason the staff never says \"it's my pleasure to serve you\" .. Which I thought was a chic fil a standard ...ps they play music too loud on a boom box ... Ghetto"}
{"text":"Stopped in for what I thought would be a quick lunch. Who was I kidding?? Chic fil A at 1215p??? Prepare to wait. The drive thru was about 20 cars deep, so I ran inside. Walked in and the line was about 15 deep. I would hate to work there. Kudos to those who do, because the line moved quickly. 
 My cashier was lovely and got me through the process quickly, which I appreciated. My food was brought out quickly and I left a happy camper. 
The spicy chicken never disappoints. Great stuff"}
{"text":"This location is normally pretty busy, but it is generally rather efficient and I have always been received politely and treated like a regular, even though I don't really frequent this place like a regular."}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A is all around amazing! Their food is always hot and delicious. I am always surprised of how fast they get my order out whether I'm in the drive-thru or inside. Their staff is also very courteous and you can tell that the people that work there are sincere and genuine. The restaurant has many different seating options from a booth to a table, and they also have a nice play place for the kiddos. I recommend this place to anybody looking for great food and service! I will be coming to this Chick-fil-A for many years to come!

I recommend downloading the new Chick-fil-A One app on your phone because they send out free treats randomly and you can also use the app to earn points to gain free treats."}
{"text":"Fantastic service is second to none. Always go with the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, with Sweet Tea and Fries. Love how they give you sauce without nickeling and diming you like some places ... McDonald's."}
{"text":"This place has the best employees and management team I have ever seen or heard of, they treat customers with respect and dignity regardless of the situation.  Thank you for allowing me to eat  your delicious fresh made food while it was still hot. I will always go out of my way to eat there. Customer for life. Sincerely Henry & Family"}
{"text":"Consistency. This is what I have found at this place. With food and service. I have found that progressively their is a younger demographic in regards to working staff, however it looks like training and management has upheld standards"}
{"text":"My best friend and I have been looking forward to Chick-fil-A to come to Vegas and we had the best first experience at this location. The line went by so fast, everything was super organized, and every member of the staff was amazing. Everyone was super friendly and welcomed us with open arms. We will be frequent visitors for sure!"}
{"text":"Sad to see you this CFA continue to go downhill.it used to have the friendliest, happy, helpful people. Now they don't pay attention, best word I can think of is surly.  Now it will be my pleasure to go to Woodlawn. Wish I could give S Blvd  2 1/2 stars. also 93.5 rating. I expect high 90s at a CFA."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best Chick-fil-A's I've ever been to, and I grew up in Atlanta...so that's saying something. Tony, the owner/operator is WONDERFUL. I ordered curb side pick up and when my coffee wasn't exactly how I ordered it, they remade it and brought it all the way down to the car (and some extra Chick-fil-A sauce), no questions asked, with a big smile. Huge fan, Tony! Keep killin it!!!!"}
{"text":"I still never understand how the people at Chick-fil-A are so friendly.  But this place is awesome they have never messed up my order.  When there is a long line they have 2 people outside taking orders so it speeds up the process and doesn't take as long."}
{"text":"This place is best place everrrrrrrrrr. Every time when I come to this place, I left with a happy face and satisfied stomach. Spicy chicken deluxe is the best of the best!"}
{"text":"There were 12 people in line and 1 person taking orders. It looked like everyone had a long wait to get their food also. I waited in line for 10 mins and it didn't move, so I left."}
{"text":"Chick filet is always good but our meal at the restaurant tonight was great!  The chicken tenders, chicken deluxe sandwich and  waffle fries were all fresh and hot.   Make sure to get the lemonade;  it is much much better than the usual on-tap stuff!  Btw, all service was friendly and speedy - really liked that the gal was there in the seating area to get the sauce that we forgot to ask for!!"}
{"text":"\"My pleasure.\" I love Chick-fil-A. Good food and always friendly service. No other place beats their chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place tops the other Chick-fil-A restaurants I've been to. The service here is very polite and keeps any eye out if you need any drink refills. The presentation of the meal was superb and timely."}
{"text":"seasonal peach shake... soooooo good!  chicken biscuit breakfast sandwich... the best!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife stopped in for a quick breakfast and I figured it would be good just like their lunch.  I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed with the breakfast. Customer service was great and store clean just the food wasn't on point."}
{"text":"Chicken strips... good. Buffalo sauce... good. Sweet tea... good! I love the uber-cheery staff, super easy and tasty menu, and those two pickles on the original chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Location is right off highway 74 and is pretty popular. There is parking and some stores and hotels within walking distance. I have been there several times on different days and times and and they will have two lines circling the place. The drive through is insane. FYI the inside is just as crowded. Since it's in a good location near highway 485 and 74 it's a busy place. The staff can be nice but they can be talkative with each other and ignore you a bit. It's similar to the other chick fil a chains. The place is clean and the food is good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great location. They are always clean and have good customer service. It's the only chick fil a in Indian trail, but they certainly are worth it. Fresh food with healthy options is always a plus. Drive through is different where you have a person outside taking your order and paying at the same time. It's comparable prices to other fast food competitors. I recommend- eat more chicken. Lol"}
{"text":"I love, love this location. They understand the meaning of being Uptown and the foot traffic that comes with that.

During lunch hours, they always have a minimum of 5 order takers posted, noticing. And before you're almost finished paying for your order, your food is ready. It's great. 

Everyone is pretty familiar with Chick Fil A food, so I won't comment on that other than \"Delicious, as usual.\""}
{"text":"Fast drive through service at lunch time!!! They have 4 people outside to take your order and your money   Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"The service is always quick, and food always comes out hot and delicious. Employees are nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We loved our experience. Chik fil a is a favorite for us. Every employee was pleasant and welcomed us. The restaurant was clean and tidy. Very impressed."}
{"text":"The Grilled Market Salad was amazing and the service was too! Nice to see happy people who love their job's! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice. Typical CFA store. As long as you don't request anything in slight change from the menu board. And if you arrive at 10:10 am and want to go through the drive thru, you will already be too late for breakfast! (They are rather slooooooow in the morning)."}
{"text":"Be sure you check your Chick Fil A bag to make sure your order is complete! It seems every time I go through their drive through, my order will inevitably be missing an item. Most of the time it's my hash browns. When I call back to let them know, they say they'll send me a coupon. But funny enough it never comes in the mail. The food is good - IF you actually get it home.  Go to the one on Rea and Ardrey Kell instead."}
{"text":"I take my family here at least once a week. We rarely have problems and when I do and ask to be contacted by management by survey or online feedback, I never hear back! Very disappointing, Chris Gammel! You don't seem to care about customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"The staff sucks. Student workers are friendly but the rest of the staff are beyond rude. Every single time I get food here. After waiting 20 minutes for my order and having people after me pick up food for about 10 minutes, I decided to ask the status of my order. \"We don't mess up orders\" was her response. So I asked her to check again. Guess what? They messed up and didn't put in my order. Just one example of many bad experiences I've had this 15-16 school year...last year was so much better. Change the staff."}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-a their chicken never disappoints. Went here for dinner tonight and it was kinda busy in the drive thru but it always goes really fast. The food is always hot here and employees are nice!"}
{"text":"It's Chick Fil A, is a review necessary? 
I don't have any of these back home. I always make it a point to go when I'm in town. 
The staff is always friendly and efficient. 
My order is always correct, the food is always good.
I ALWAYS bring home a bag of their chocolate chip cookies. I get in trouble if I come home without them."}
{"text":"Leo is fantastic. Always goes above and beyond to provide excellent customer service. EVERY time I come here, I can always count on him to be awesome."}
{"text":"Horrible 
Place order for Chicken Bowl with Hash browns 
It was placed on my plate within seconds was totally uncooked 
pile of cold cheese on top of tater tots nasty , went to counter to see if I could get it reheated was totally ignored for almost 5 mins  and asked for my money back was told they were busy and had no concern about the Customer at all there were 3 customers in the store 
Also the name badge was stuck in my face in case I was going to Complain along with the Attended leaving the Counter and was getting ready to come at me Angry walking towards me .
do you want your Kids seeing this .
Some Boros is right next next door and has Chicken that is Cooked with Great Customer Service .
my Wife and I will never go to Chick-fil-A again .Hopefully someone sees this from that Location."}
{"text":"They never get an order wrong! The food is great! Have never had unfriendly wait staff. Cleanliness exceeds expectations. 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chick Fil A spot cause my friend comes here like 3 times a week. And he LOVES chick Fil A. I think the service industry could learn a lot from this company. The way they have their service set up, their customer service is better than some nice sit down restaurants. More importantly, it doesn't feel fake. 

I even got a free sandwich out of this place by reviewing them online from my receipt. Only thing I have a problem with is that each sand witch with all the sauce can be a ton of calories. I can't believe my friend isn't fat."}
{"text":"So we decided to just go for it knowing its was probably going to be insane... it was! The line for the drive through was out to the street. There where people standing outside the door, in line to get in... I decided to time our trip, almost certain that we'd be there for over 30 mins for sure! The line started moving rather quickly. The first person handed me a menu, then the next person took our order and payment. There were 2 lanes of cars and eventually it turned in to one, at that point another person brought our receipt out, then we headed to the end of the drive through. We got our food, then they directed us to the sauce at the end of the cones, that was pretty rad! All of this and we were in and out in under 20 minutes, what!? Yes, it's true! I was amazed, this store gets 10 stars!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and nutritious! Very inexpensive, easy for feeding hungry mouths. BTW delicious tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is soooo good, yet sooo full of hate.  If they were to get into fisticuffs my stomach would beat my brain.  Until my brain wins this battle my stomach will keep choosing Chick Fil A. 
I'll keep eating your delicious poultry but how about you stop funding hate groups?  Pretty please?"}
{"text":"I am so happy that Chuck-fil-a has breakfast, since it is the biggest meal of the day for me. This trip sampled the large fruit cup, Greek yogurt, and of course small hash browns with ketchup. They bring the order to your table when it is not too busy. If not you just wait right next to the register with a red marker. 

For the breakfast time this store was not busy at all and either was the drive thru. The store is extremely clean and they are highly considerate of their customers health. The garbage cans are robotic and open by themselves."}
{"text":"Food order is always correct and hot. Milkshakes are good. The best fast food nuggets. The Polynesian sauce is so good."}
{"text":"Rudest staff!!! Ordered a small vanilla iced coffee and the cup was about 1/4 straight syrup!! I told her it was all syrup, she said try shaking it, so I did while waiting for my order, tried it and it was still TOO sweet!! This was not even drinkable!! I told her and this 'genius' asked if I wanted MORE syrup, after expressing several times there was already too much! I really wanted a refund, but for the sake of the line I asked for an 'original' instead, she made the original and I'm CONVINCED that she didn't add the coffee...I taste flavored milk....I ended up throwing my coffee away....thanks Chic Fil A...."}
{"text":"I have to give Chik Fil A super props for handling their grand opening this way. Since they've opened I've had breakfast twice and lunch once. Why all the hype around a fast food place? Because it's fun to go to and very welcoming to return to! I love how nice and enthusiastic the staff are. 

So far I've had their chicken biscuit for breakfast, their sausage burrito breakfast, and their original chicken sandwich for lunch. The sauces really make the food exciting. 

I do recommend trying anything that has chicken lol and their white sauce is really good. Don't be scared of the lines! I was in a line of like 20+ cars and was done writhing 20/25 minutes. Same as In N Out. Not bad at all. 

Only complaint is my waffles fries were a bit soggy."}
{"text":"This CFA was always busy and full of kids for mine to play with. We wound up here several times on a recent visit to our family. I mean, it is CFA, they treat you well, the food was great, and the play area was big enough to fit the 10 or so kids that were in it every time!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but praise to say about this location.  Today was my daughters birthday party.   We preordered platters ahead.    My husband came home with only one platter but paid for two.   The manager I believe his name was Jessie went out of his way to bring the other platter to our house.    No that is great customer service.   Thank you so much for going the extra mile for your customers.  Our family and friends enjoyed the chicken so much."}
{"text":"Gotta love Chick Fil A! The staff at this particular  location are particularly kind and attentive. They suggested that I try an Arnold Palmer with unsweetened tea and their infamous lemonade...and now I am officially addicted!"}
{"text":"We like bringing our kids to chick fil a because of the nice family atmosphere. We unknowingly came here on a fundraiser night. Even though it was very busy, the tables were cleared fast and the bathrooms were clean. 
I didn't give 5 stars because we were slightly disappoint in the under cooked fries and chicken nuggets. We still are everything up but I prefer when the fries and chicken are crisper."}
{"text":"As with all of the Chick-Fil-A locations I have been to, this location is clean, the staff are friendly, and the food is consistently good. Considering that they have only been open for 2 days, everything is running very smoothly (we have been to this location three times in the past two days).

I can't say I have a favorite item because I honestly love almost everything on the menu. I hope they start selling the merchandise like some of the other locations. I am looking forward to continuing to visit this location."}
{"text":"Love the friendly staff and service.
Food is always fresh.
We love coming here and seeing the regulars and the staff. The place is always clean also"}
{"text":"I've visited Chick-fil-A's in Chicago, but the Madison location is just like the rest, they are all organized, are setup to specifically handle customer flow, and are efficient down to the ingredients.

My only gripe with this location has nothing to do with the food, but moreso the location. Being near the mall is a bit of a cramped location, and occasionally you can get stuck behind someone who can seem to understand that this place serves chicken at the drive-thru. On more than one occasion I've had to sit behind someone who just can't make up their mind, but this isn't the fault of Chick-fil-A.

The food amazing, the GM Jamie is very friendly, and the manager Nate is often seen helping serve food and has helped me personally on several occasions. The food is always fresh here, you're not going to get something that has been sitting idle for a long period of time. Definitely go, and it's helpful that all the calorie information is posted as well."}
{"text":"I prefer beef, but will EAT MOR CHIKIN every once in a while.  If you didn't know, Chick-fil-A finally decided to open in Las Vegas.  The first two locations are actually located in Henderson.  So technically, this is the very first Las Vegas location.  I drove by on their first day of business and was shocked that the drive-thru had only 4 cars in line.  Well that was last week.  The word is out.  This Chick-fil-A is open and it is busy.  The drive-thru line was long, but looked quick and organized.  After cars pay and pick up their food, they're directed to a separate tent where they can get their dipping sauces.  The lines inside the restaurant made it to the doors, which isn't that long.  We are pros at busy Chick-fil-A's and will take advantage of the One App whenever there's a line. We ordered ahead, waited 7 minutes & 23 seconds, and picked up our food.  We dined inside and it wasn't crowded at all. The restaurant is very clean and sports a lot of Chick-fil-A Vegas advertising. 

Chick-fil-A didn't invent the chicken, just the chicken sandwich.  That's one of their mottos.  If you haven't been to Chick-fil-A, then I suggest that you try the Original Chicken Sandwich with their chicken strips or nuggets.  In my opinion, the Original Chicken Sandwich is just okay.  It's their nuggets, both grilled and breaded, that I love.  Each chicken nugget is made with real chicken meat, just enough breading, and taste so good.  Their grilled chicken nuggets is the bomb too.  I can't end a Chick-fil-A review without mentioning their waffle fries.  These are the best and there's no wrong way to eat them.  EAT MOR WAFFUL FRYS!!!"}
{"text":"This CFA is right off the interstate and easy to get in and out of. Being that the store is very old looking I was a little worried that the quality would not be like other stores in the area are. While it was fairly easy to order the folks working the registers were a little talkie to each other. The food was good and while it seemed like the place was a little dirty, I think it was good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing people. Fantastic service.  Owner stop to talk with us and even gave us free coupons!"}
{"text":"Why did the chicken cross the road?

To get away from me, that's why.  I will go through phases throughout the year when I am eating a lot of chicken and I mean A LOT.  And when I get bored of silly chicken breast that I'm cooking at home, a place like Chick-fil-A fits just perfect.  We all could EAT MOR CHIKIN every once in a while. 

Las Vegas was in a need of a Chick-fil-A for a very, very long time.  Chick-fil-A is known for their chicken sandwich and waffle fries.  Both are very good.  I recommend trying both if you're a first timer.  Their menu has also improved over the past 10 years. Some of the items that used to be on their \"secret\" menu are now permanent items at Chick-fil-A.  My favorites include their waffle fries, the chicken nuggets, and their grilled chicken nuggets.  Their nuggets is lightly breaded, made with real chicken, and taste delicious.  Where else can you get 12 chicken nuggets that's less than 410 calories, carbs less than 20 grams, and protein over 40 grams?  And if the fat is too high for you on their nuggets, there's always the option to go grilled (8 nuggets is only 140 calories with 23 grams of protein).  Sorry for the nutritional lesson, but that's why I love Chick-fil-A.  Their chicken is not mystery meat, it's packed with quality protein, and still taste good. 

This location is busy and it's going to be like this for a long time. One way to avoid the long drive thru and walk-in lines is to download Chick-fil-A's One App.  It's so convenient. I placed our order through my phone, we walked to the front, and within 10 minutes, our order was handed to us. We then skipped the lines, walked right in, and dined inside. That's how it's done, folks. 

I know that there's going to be a lot of haters out there. Some will call Chick-fil-A hype. Some will even say that they know of other places that are better. Everyone is going to have their say.  Everyone is going to have their own opinion.  But for me, I'm more than just a fan.  I love Chick-fil-A.  Good luck, Chick-fil-A.  Welcome to Las Vegas!!!

2017 Yelp Review #124"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A (2017 Yelp Review #239)

In my opinion, this is currently the best Chick-fil-A in Henderson.  It's the only one too.  First off, this Chick-fil-A is not as busy as it appears.  The lines are all for the drive-thru.  Take my advice, park your car, and order inside.  I've been here a couple of times and have yet to even use my One App.  The line may look long, but it actually goes by pretty quick since the staff is very efficient.  My meal has been the same on every visit...8 count nuggets with an 8 count grilled nuggets.  These entrees never disappoint and is perfect if you're watching your carb intake.  I haven't tried their sandwiches, desserts, or breakfast at this location yet.  I assume that they're just as good as the other locations."}
{"text":"SIX STARS! This place is so well-run, from the top down, kudos to the management.  There's a person who delivers the food to you, and then this same person gets you free refills! I'm looking outside, and there is a veritable brigade of employees with iPads, taking orders on foot from the line that has wrapped around the bldg! Uber-efficiency -- I love it! And they do *everything* with a smile and courtesy and respect.  The food is top-notch and doesn't leave you feeling \"funny\" or bloated afterwards like at other fast food joints.  I think it's because they use high-quality peanut & canola oils. Well done! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Typical CFA with top-notch service, delicious food, clean interiors, and free WiFi.

CFA continues to impress me in every instance with outstanding customer service, food, and clean interiors. I really appreciate them adding healthier items to their menu such as the kale superfood side that we are seeing in California at least.

This location is right next to the mall and has its own parking lot and drive-thru. Everyone was very kind and personable. The table service here is better than most sit-down restaurants. For that, CFA continues to be in the elite tier of fast food."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Always!!!! First of all please change your 1 star reviews to 4.  Bad experience. These people are insanely busy all day nonstop. I just sat for 1 hr to get drive thru. It's amazing. Give them a break. It's sooooooooooo busy.  They will mellow out. Deserves 6 stars!!"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best quick service restaurant I have ever seen (21 years in recruiting). Every employee is polite and helpful and demonstrates outstanding customer service. It is sparkling clean and very kid friendly. Each Tuesday is Family Night and there is a balloon artist and crafts for kids...and great healthy food"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service from this location. First I'm I've ever had something bad to say about a chick fil a. I placed a Mobile order and clicked \"I'm here\" when I got outside he restaurant. No one came outside to bring food as the instructions had said so I went in and stood under the sign. Then still no signs of my order. About 7-10 mins went by and no one said hi or hello or what am standing there for... the. Finally I said \"where is my order\" not only did the order take forever to arrive. But they messed up on the actual order itself..."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent! I do get a little bugged out by the amount kids and noise. Great place, service and food otherwise if you can deal with lots of people, noise and crowded parking lot you'll be OK."}
{"text":"This is slowest chick-fil-a ever and food is low quality for chick fil a standards.  If you can go to one in camelback, better service and better food"}
{"text":"This place was too hype for me. I went in thinking I can get a fried chicken meal. But only to find they serve chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.

We got the spicy chicken sandwich with fries. It was delicious but curious to what had happened to the lettuce and tomato and a beat up bun. The meat was delicious and a pickle to add a kick to the sandwich. But nothing that I will crave and order again.

The fries was quite amazing and cut into waffles shape. It wasn't nothing special but the waffle shape added volume and crunch.

Would I come back...I don't think so. But for those who wants to try. The service in this location is top notch and very kind and accommodating. The place is clean and well kept, they were quick with the orders from the drive thru and line up inside. So keep up the good job, but need a better presentation of food to get returning customers."}
{"text":"The staff is what gives this place a 5 star. 
They make an effort to remember your name and that makes a difference. 
The managers are always visible and everyone is welcoming"}
{"text":"Because it's a chain, the only way to differentiate this Chick-fil-a from another location is the service.  I've been here three times & each time have been treated as if the transaction was being filmed on \"The Undercover Boss.\"  The last time I was there, they didn't have my sandwich ready, so they brought me out a brand new sandwich & gave me a free order or fries - hand delivered to my car in the parking lot.  This is how it's supposed to be a fast-food restaurant - I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Had a coupon good for a certain day only it said go to any chik fil a that serves breakfast between 6am n 10:30 am and get a free hashbrown scramble...got there waited in the drive thru ordered got to the window to be told they won't honor it and the manager argued w me over it.. by the end she said do u still want ur food and u said no... it was wrong to not honor the coupon and to argue w me over... horrible customer service"}
{"text":"I had the best fast food salad in my life. I had the cob chicken salad with lime acocado sauce. It is so good! I'm been a fan of chick-fil-a for years in Illinois."}
{"text":"The food is amazing because it's Chick Fil A but this location needs improvement. The drive thru line is insane, blocking traffic on South Blvd."}
{"text":"Food was good, I don't really get the fuss... but service was good and food was fast and fresh. Lemonade is awesome also"}
{"text":"First off, I love Chick-fil-A!  However, 1 out of 3 times my order tastes like it's been sitting out whenever I order from this location.  Normally I just suck it up since it's too much of a pain after going through the drive thru to go back to the restaurant to say anything.  Recently though I dined in the restaurant hoping my food would be fresh and warm....it was not.  I still hesitated to say anything simply because it's awkward and uncomfortable.  After a few more bites, I decided it's just not worth it and I wanted fresh food!  I reluctantly approached the counter and the young man asked what I needed.  I told him my food tasted like it had been sitting out and was not warm.  He then grabbed his manager, a tall male with a mustache.  This man was NOT friendly at all.  I started to explain the problem to him and, after a minute, he cuts me off to call on a female manager to come over an told her to take care of it.  I then start to explain it to her and she also cuts me off and defends the food saying she doesn't know how it's possible the food wasn't fresh because they've been so busy all night and the food has been flying off the shelf.  I was already reluctant to say anything and now I feel like I'm being shamed or called a liar which made me extremely uncomfortable.  I told her ok nevermind then maybe it's my fault we will just finish it.  She then says she will get us new food it's not a problem.  Really?  Not a problem? Because I just had to talk to three employees and be made a fool.  She brings over a new order very quickly and what do you know?  It's warm and fresh.  So it is possible to provide better tasting food!  Why did I have to go through so much trouble to get it?  My advice, if someone tells you they are not happy, simply apologize (which no one EVER did) and say we will get you a new order right away.  I was totally polite and never rude, don't be rude to me."}
{"text":"first time in a chik fil a. The food was nothing more than just what I can make at home. Service was bad. It almost felt as if the cashier didn't want to serve me and my husband. Not sure if it was racial or homophobia. Based on this experience, I will never return to any chik fil a. If the food was good, I could forget about the bad service. But that was not the case."}
{"text":"This is a fast food restaurant and I am writing review. This tells it all. This one has great kid friendly playground and the staffs are awesome. Even though we do lots of drive-through, it will be awesome dining inside if we had time. I wonder how they do this in fast food restaurant. I heard they get paid well and it is definitely working well. Good job Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"This is the worst chick fil-a I have ever seen 

The cashier has to take my order twice, was so slow. Then he gives me an ice tea with no ice. 
The order came out wrong. 

The manager/ franchisee must be absent. This store is not clean ( crumbs on the tables). And they are always hiring. They have a retention problem."}
{"text":"Chicken Filet is what it is. Good chicken.
But at this location , if you go thru the drive thru... CHECK YOUR BAG EVERY SINGLE TIME!
EVERY SINGLE TIME!
Otherwise you'll be missing something for sure .
That's my biggest complaint."}
{"text":"Maybe the other locations ruined it for me, but this location just does NOT have the same customer service standard as all other locations. 

It was 9:30am, but we wanted lunch food. I asked the girl if we could order from the regular menu and she said (while annoyed) \"yeah but it'll be like 5 minutes\". I said okay because I love their lunch food. We each got a meal that came with a soda. The sodas were handed to us half empty and covered in soda on the outside of the cup. Considering we ordered our food to go, you would think the girl would have been considerate enough to wipe the cups. It also annoys me when you're paying for a drink and it's handed to you half empty. I understand that the location does free refills, but again, we ordered our food to go. We also ordered two spicy sandwiches, so we could really use those drinks!! Please see photo for messy sodas. 

I'm still giving 2 stars because the food was great, as always. We love their food!"}
{"text":"I was totally impressed with this fast-food chain location.  The food was hot and fresh, the employees were friendly.  The place was well-lit, has a huge play area for kids, and was spotless.

It was seriously like a model example of how a fast-food place is SUPPOSED to be...it's a good thing they're not all like this or I would eat a lot more of it!"}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast.  It was good.  Nice, new location with good customer service."}
{"text":"I'm a regular, but it's also worth noting I am a regular \"mobile user\". I come here often for mobile ordering. I get the spicy chicken deluxe meal with the spicy chicken with multigrain bun no butter, parfait, medium diet lemonade and sometimes I'll add a medium waffle fry. 
For this particular location I would say the workers sometimes act a bit nervous and lack care. The customer service appears to take an attempt here but compared to other locations this one isn't spectacular in terms of customer service. They are attentive when you approach the counter rather mobile or ordering. 
For mobile orders I noticed a lack, maybe getting everyone to call out the mobile order by name and not \"mobile order?\". Just a tip to make customers feel more personal with Chick-Fil-a. More smiles I would recommend more here as it lacks. 
My deluxe chicken sandwich is always juicy and crispy even all over with a fresh piece of lettuce, pickles, and the multigrain bun that I always substitute for a healthier option choice compared to butter bun.( I love butter ). The parfait is a size that's not to bad , where it lacks in size gets made up with the fresh big strawberries they insert into the cup, along with fresh blueberries. The Harvest nut granola is very good compared to others like McDonalds parfait mix. The parfaits are a great substitution and usually my go too 
The diet lemonade I use to worry about getting but GET IT, the taste is not far off and you deserve not to have so much sugar in you from the regular. 
This location gets 5 stars based on mobile experience, it's always fast using the app and if you click \"I'm here\" while in the parking lot checking 3 emails on your smartphone and walking under the pickup sign your order will be ready.  NO WAIT. 
Go eat and have a chic-tastic day!"}
{"text":"The lady in the window was so rude I asked politely if she may give more ketchup and she literally threw me 1 pack like calm down it's 9 am to start a bad day seriously I always buy at chick fil a and this experience made me change my mind on buying food from here unbelievable they need to hire nice people in this location especially if they speak with customers"}
{"text":"So glad that Biltmore has a Chick-Fil-A Gem!  We were invited to a private opening dinner.  It was so great, they even had a red carpet!  They seated all the guests and then proceeded to serve samples of many of their items.  
The decor/design is great as it is more \"urban!\" 
We will be hitting us this hot spot often."}
{"text":"Of all the fast food restaurants in Charlotte this is the one I've had the best experience with. The food is of a decent standard, as Chick-Fil-A usually is, and I've always found the staff to be polite and a pleasure to interact with (which is a huge plus in Charlotte's often grouchy fast food industry). I recommend it, even if the line often spills out into Randolph."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and am usually happy with the food and service. Slightly more expensive than other fast food options but better quality for sure. I recommend the chick-fil-a app to avoid waiting in line and minimize interaction with people - not because they're not great, I just don't like people."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service!  Their chicken is really good.  I also admire a company that stands fast to their standards for quality and service.  But don't forget, they don't open on Sundays!

Lines are crazy long.  My suggestion would be to walk-in.  I really do enjoy their chicken.  Crisp, moist, tasty.  I swear they must run about 50 people in the joint.  There is always someone to take care of you, to refresh your drink, get your condiments, etc.

Bottom line: Great place for chicken... But ALWAYS crowded."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Chick-fil-As in the area. All of the employees look very laid back and unprofessional. Came In at 9:45 and when I ordered my food, I was told that they close in 15 minutes and that I am not permitted to eat inside and must take it to go. I let it go and ate outside and then when it hit 10, one of the team members immediately went to a group of people eating and told them that they had to leave. This is unacceptable behavior for someone working in a restaurant and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We don't have Chick Fil A up in New York, so we decided to give it a try while down here in Pennsylvania.  We stopped in for an early lunch (around 11am).  

There was actually a really large group of school girls and their moms in there.  I think they were on a cheerleading trip or something.  They let us go ahead of them, but I felt pressured to order, so I just told my husband to pick something for me while I went to use the restroom (which was clean!)

I ended up having a spicy chicken sandwich.  It was pretty good - I like the pepper cheese that came on it.  I also really enjoyed the waffle fries.

My husband did say that the staff was very friendly when he ordered.

An attendant was constantly moving around the dining room to make sure things were clean... though I had to look at three tables before finding a clean one.

For all of the hype Chick Fil A gets from my friends down south, I wasn't overly impressed, but it was a decent fast-food meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"Great food.  The staff & service is what really makes this place nice to come to.  They are very friendly and check on everyone at the tables.  They are even willing to take your trash and refill your drinks.  I personally don't take advantage of that, but some do.  Kids area could be larger."}
{"text":"My love of Chick-fil-A is strong and true!  It used to be, I was only able to enjoy this deliciousness while in California visiting. But now, it's down the street!  I frequent this location and everyone is always friendly, my order has always been correct - even on busy nights.  When I've eaten inside, it's always nice and clean.  I love the kids meal options for my toddler and I have to say, this is her favorite place to eat as well.  We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Chik-Fil-A is eating a hole in the burger market and this new location close to a major hospital makes it easy to see why. 
Clean, friendly employees provide prompt service. This location has the added benefit of not being an utter madhouse, as well. Yet. 
The food was spot-on, as always, the seating arrangements are comfortable, the car court for the kids is cute, and this should be your go-to as soon as you get that nasty gash sewn up at Banner Health hospital."}
{"text":"This particular restaurant seems to be taking a downhill turn in the past six months. We have been to this restaurant several times and each time we seem to have an issue.They have been serving dried up breakfast biscuits in the morning. One time we went they said they did not have any salt packets and we asked if they could loan us a salt shaker in drive-through and they said they did not have any of those either. How does a restaurant run out of salt?

A week later we got there chicken strips and they ran out of Chick-fil-A sauce. These are basic things that you can stockpile that you should never run out of."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrified. I just got back with lunch, I bite into the sandwich and this absolutely disgusting giant gooey, rubbery tendon like thing is there. I have never been more grossed out. See picture. So long for chicken."}
{"text":"Best service and great food. My husband always gets us food from this location. The staff is super nice and fast. I love their signature sauce and waffle fries."}
{"text":"Hate the people standing at the \"speaker\" and the new menu boards. Get rid of these people and lower the prices. More expensive now!!! Yuk"}
{"text":"Not sure what hype is all about for chicken. Wasn't impressed on the chicken bites. A friend of mine bit into one that was under cooked (pink). I probably won't eat there after that. That's pretty disgusting.."}
{"text":"Of course the food is good but the service is amazing here. They wait on you and they are just so nice!!! They have great employees at this location!!"}
{"text":"The workers have it down like a well oiled machine. The wait wasn't really that bad considering we went for lunch on a holiday. The food was hot and fresh. The parking is still being worked out. We parked near the TJ Maxx and walked over. There was a worker taking orders in an iPad while waiting in line. I got to the register gave them my name, they confirmed my order, I paid, and they gave me my drink. My daughter already found a table and our food was delivered fresh. Definitely worth the 40 minute drive from Aliante. Now one needs to open closer."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon to get lunch to go.  We arrived a little after 1 PM to see the drive thru line backed up so we decided to go inside to order. Being a brand new building, everything inside was as immaculate as you will see in a fast food restaurant. The inside was extremely clean and this Chick-fil-a had some nicer features like a hand motion sensor garbage disposal. 

We ordered chicken strips and fries for lunch. The wait for our food was a little longer than what we are used to having with the Chick-fil-a in Cranberry, but yet it was still rather impressive given how new the location was and how busy it was on Saturday afternoon.

The food here is solid as always with friendly staff.  This is probably my favorite fast food restaurant and I'm very glad this location opened as it is now the closest one for me to get to."}
{"text":"Being a Chick Fil A Veteran, (all the way back in college..yikes) I can't get enough of this place. With the exception of a few kitchens, they all seem to be perfect. 

I am fortunate enough to work directly across the parking lot from this CFA. I frequently hit the long line for my fix on my lunch hour. (Number one, no pickles, diet lemonade...perfection.) 

One day, to my embarrassment, I forgot my debit card, and couldn't find it anywhere! Fortunately, the amazing girl behind the counter just said, I'll take care of it. WHAT?! Real life. I've never had that happen to me before! I wish she would have had a nametag on, so she could get the shout out she deserves. 

Occasionally, it can get a little busy in here, and the evening crew can slack a little more than the morning crew, but that's to be expected. 

All in all, great place. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A.  Best chicken sandwiches anywhere!  They don't have them up in the northwest, so my wife and I always go out of our way to hit one up when we are in the area!  The people are always friendly and the food is, in my opinion, the best fast food available.  I also love that this place is closed on Sunday's (except when I'm hungry) so that workers are guaranteed an opportunity to spend time with family, etc.  There aren't many companies in corporate america that would do that!"}
{"text":"Delicious as always. Good service, good food, and a bright clean atmosphere.. can't get much better"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have Chick-fil-A finally in Vegas. After church stop everything is so good . The lemonade is the best ever."}
{"text":"They kept messing up my order . I didn't believe the reviews.. I was asking myself : how can there be a bad Chick-fil-A ? Well there is. And this location is just sad ."}
{"text":"All I know if chick fi la is currently saving my life because I was sick all night last night and I dare you to try and find another place that will serve you soup at 6am. And the man I spoke to on the phone was so nice about it! \"Mam we can make you anything on the lunch menu, it might just take a couple minutes longer.\" Oh and the soup it amazing!"}
{"text":"I know, I know, it's a fast food restaurant that pretty much only sells chicken and has lately been under fire for the beliefs of it's owner... I know, and thankfully however, I don't care. When one of the sweetest and most excited people I run across all day is a teen-aged girl working at a fast food place, I know they are doing something very well. I'm happy to have this Chick-fil-A move into my neighborhood replacing an ugly older burger place, the building is modern and bright with an eye catching design to it. The In-N-Out of the chicken world, Chick-fil-A is as good as it gets quality-wise for fast food, I've had a few things on the menu and they've all been tasty, and they have without question the best fast food breakfast lineup. I don't eat this stuff too often, but I'm sure glad to have this as another option for myself and the rest of Tempe."}
{"text":"You may be surprised to learn that they sell mostly chicken based sandwiches.

Also, it's not \"you're welcome\" it's \"my pleasure\" when you are at the Fil-A."}
{"text":"Busiest Chick Fil A in Charlotte? Maybe, but Beckie and her staff do a great job ushering everyone through with a smile and good service. Food is good, just like every other Chick Fil A and this location does a lot of the CHick Fil A promotion specials (i.e. free fry day, free spicy chicken biscuit, etc)."}
{"text":"I for one love chick fla this location not so much the service is extremely slow and they always mess up my order. I guess I'll just keep driving up to the Mathews location they always seem to get it right. But as for this location I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Can y'all please make your hash browns not soggy. They look crispy but always such a disappointment.  I avoid coming to this location for breakfast as much as possible."}
{"text":"Hands down the best chickfila in the area. Very consistent with their amazing quality of food.They're hash browns are 9/10 times crispy not soggy. (Unlike most chickfilas) They're chicken minis are never dry. They are very fast, especially with the drive thru, and when I order fries at breakfast hours. They also make the best half tea, half lemonades."}
{"text":"Love this Chicfila!! They have top notch team members and the owner is hands-on! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Wow. Not a normal Chicfila experience at all. We ordered on the app. The food wasn't ready and took a while to be prepared. Service inside was not on par. No one greeted us and one customer needing a refill finally got it herself. The buns were soaked in butter so much it took the breading off my chicken sandwich. I suspect it's just \"new restaurant challenges\" but it will be a while before we visit again."}
{"text":"This particular location tends to get busy because it's on university and is near campus. The parking lot/drive thru situation is a bit busy and chaotic but just comes with the territory of being near campus. The food is almost always great; there are rare times when we get fries that are dry and not fresh but that's rare. The service is great and the employees are accommodating and often give out more sauces w/o charging when you ask. The chicken nuggets are disappointing and dry but the sandwiches and fries are great."}
{"text":"Other than finding something weird in my food this is usually a good location.  I went for lunch and had a spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries"}
{"text":"I loved the attention and customer service this chick-fil-A always provided me until one day I decided to use the drive thru and once I got to work and decided to eat my lunch and took my first bite I noticed that the lettuce had a weird texture and tasted different, to my surprise when I decide to take a look, it was old lettuce and it was soggy and after that I'll honestly never come back to this specific one. Would rather go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"One of my sinful, guilty pleasures, because of the taboo. Why? Well, because of their certain, extreme stances (gay marriage) back in 2012, and all of the hurt and angry hearts caused by the aftermath. I mean, I am not gay, but I do have loved ones (family and friends) who ARE gay, and so this hits home with me. And, even if I didn't have loved ones around me, it would still bother me because it just doesn't seem right...Huge heart for my loved ones and their protection, as well as justice for those who are part of any kind of minority and suffering opposition, teasing, etc.

I mean, their president and COO announced that they are \"very much supportive of the family - the biblical definition of the family unit\". This \"biblical unit\" did not meet the same family unit definition that many members of the LGBT. 

This whole mess did cause significant damage to Chick-fil-A's reputation as well as lost many loyal customers, as mayors in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco stepped in to ban any future Chick-fil-A stores being built further on (unless some changes/apologies were made).

On a personal note, I was working for a major Fortune 500 company at the time of this, and my ER Director happened to be gay. She was a very reputable person within our business, and had a long-time girlfriend, as well as tons of dogs. My Director, at the time, barked out some colorful words regarding Chick-fil-A, and I remember feeling bummed that it had to come to this. I dunno...

Our company at the time was coordinating a celebration of diversity within our company, to offer free food, speakers, games, give-aways, etc. When I sat down at our first planning meeting an noticed Chick-fil-A as one of the food vendors, I couldn't help but raise my hand on this on. The more I talked about my concerns and the possible negative responses, perceptions if we serve food from this restaurant, the more nods I got from my peers and Managers. It was unanimious - they were out, and we needed a replacement.

Now that it's 2016, things have simmered down a bit. I know the entire topic hasn't been rested and put to bed - by far... But, this group shouldn't be condemned for their thoughts and stances on life - should they? I mean, it's not like I\"m going to be best friends with a Cashier in my future... Or attend their church services ever?

So, more internal dialogue, I have come to a conclusion. I want their chicken and sauces. And Fries. I feel dirty sliding into the drive-thru, but still proceed. The chicken w/sauces and fries were outstanding. Did they change me and/or my core? Hell no. Am I going to visit them frequently? Noo... Once in awhile? Sure, why not. I know what I believe it - period. Just give me your chicken and that's were it all ends. Period."}
{"text":"Oh Chick-Fil-A you are  a love/hate relationship. Love because I cannot get enough of your waffle fries and their chicken nuggets. Hate because I  usually travel through this airport on Sundays and they are closed that they.
This is a newer location in the airport but what I can say from the last time I visited is that their staff is really friendly and despite the amount of people that were waiting to order I didn't had to wait long."}
{"text":"They didn't invent the chicken sandwich, they just made it better. Much better!

This location is right next to a McD's an Arby's and a couple of sub places, so it's always hopping busy. Never stressed, the crew here seems to do a solid job and they've yet to mess me up.

I don't want to look under the covers and find out if Chik-Fil-A is any healthier than McDonald's. I'm just going to continue in my intentional bliss that it's chicken and therefore it has to be better than anything that Mickey D's has to offer. La la la la! Not listening!

Best invention at the Fil-A? Waffle fries! OMG, perfection. I could eat these all day long.

One tip. I really can't stand that pickle on my chicken sandwich. Even if I take it off, the taste is still there. They'll make you a fresh one if you ask. I just always forget to ask. Argh!

Other than seeing Dave Thomas in the Wendy's commercials, the Chik-Fil-A \"Cows\" are the best fast food campain. Seeing them on billboards and in commercials with \"Eat Mor Chikin\" is always funny. Nicely done, guys!"}
{"text":"Waffle fries! Did you hear me? I said WAFFLE FRIES. That is all you need to know.

Drive through is the way to go here. Quick and efficient, you will be on your way with your delicious waffly (is that a word? it is now!) goodness promptly."}
{"text":"Note to self, stick with the fried chicken.

I tried the egg white grilled chicken English muffin thing on the menu this morning and let me tell you, the English Muffin is where McDonald's is winning. This egg white chicken sandwich was all kinds of disappointing. The grilled chicken was a tiny little piece of thin, chewy poultry. It was over seasoned with black pepper which is a turn off for me. The egg white was just flat and uninteresting as egg whites tend to be. Half of the cheese was on the wrapper and not the sandwich. Just not good. I like the chicken biscuit, the original chicken sandwich and the spicy delux sandwich. Not this egg white grilled...whatever.

I also like the waffle fries at Chick Fil A. As well as the hash browns. Usually. Even those were a let down today. The hash browns were chewy like the rest of my meal. Like they had been re-heated. And I could taste the oil they were fried in. It was either old or over heated. Not good. 

I don't think I've ever had a real problem with this location at Rancho and Sahara when it comes to lunch. Breakfast today was just not that good. That said, I appreciate that they had decaf coffee ready. I didn't have to wait for them to brew it like at the other location I usually go to. The coffee could be hotter but it was ready to go and it tastes good. So there you have it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars . They are amazing ! Always good food , always great service , restaurants are always clean, restrooms Are always clean .. There is one in chandler that is my fav.. They will bus your table for you when you are done eating , and grab you a refill ! As far as fast food goes this is the only place 
Oh... FREE WIFI is pretty handy as well ..."}
{"text":"Love this chicken little (chick fil a) location ! Always clean, food is served quick and fresh. What more to do need ?"}
{"text":"Third times a charm, right?

Three times I have been to this Chick-fil-A location.  Twice I was burned (or bummed) by my experience.  The first time saw my order being wrong along with the whole coffee debacle you can read about in my previous review.  

The second time I visited, because everyone deserves a second chance, wasn't quite as bad as the first.  I got a good chicken sandwich and the waffle fries were amazing.  The problem I had was that I had asked for Chick-fil-A original sauce which was confirmed over the speaker.  On my way home, as a dug around for my fries, I noticed there was no sauce packet.  Maybe they put the sauce on my sandwich.  No such luck.  I was cheated out of the sauce I've heard so much about but have never tried.  Strike two.  

That brings us to third times a charm...

I stopped in this morning on the way to work as there were only three other cars in the drive-thru.  I ordered a breakfast number 1 (chicken biscuit, hash browns and a coffee).  As before, I asked for decaf coffee.  This time I asked if it had been brewed already.  It had not but they said it would only take two minutes.  I went for it.  By the time the few cars ahead of me were leaving my coffee was ready.  Cool.  After I paid and left, I broke into the hash browns.  They were good.  Little disks of fried potato not unlike those at Carl's Jr.  But these tasted better.  It was as if McDonald's and Carl's got together and came up with these.  Not a bad thing.  As for the sandwich, it was fine.  The chicken was still not very crunchy.  Maybe even a bit chewy in places.  But it tasted fine.  And finally the coffee which I enjoyed very much.  It has a deep richness that, even though decaf, was perfect to wake me up this morning.

Its getting there."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to eat since the hype seems to have died down. We went through the drive thru and it took us exactly 15 minutes from pulling up to driving away. Not too bad. The food was hot and good. I thought it was a little weird that they had the Chick-fil-A sauce in little cups instead of the normal sauce packets. Not sure why. I like the sauce packets better since these little cups weren't hardly filled at all. We asked for extra pickles so we got four instead of two. I would like about 8. The one thing that is a littlw annoying is the workers always respond with \"my pleasure.\" I know it's the rule but it's annoying to hear it after EVERY request. People don't talk like that. I can see saying it 1-2 times but lighten up on the my pleasure. It was awkward. I've had Chick-fil-A a lot so the food was just as expected. I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Dear Chick-fil-A,

Your waffle fries are delicious, as are your chicken sandwiches.  

Love, 

Sean

p.s.  I'm scared to try your breakfast menu, because it just looks like a tiny chicken sandwich on a biscuit, which sounds pretty effing weird to me.  Actually, it sounds delicious.  I've changed my mind, Chick-fil-A, I will have one of your odd breakfast things as soon as I get the chance."}
{"text":"This is another wonderful Chick-fil-a location.  Their customer service is top shelf, the food is fast and fresh, and it's a very clean restaurant.

While known for things like chicken sandwiches and waffle fries-- both delicious-- I also like the healthy Market Salad and Spicy Southwest Salad."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is by far the best fast food chicken restaurant. I went for lunch with my boyfriend on a Saturday. The restaurant was very busy but we did not wait long to order or receive our food. The service was AMAZING the staff was so friendly! Our chicken sandwiches and fries were so tasty. Fast food isn't really my thing but I will make an exception for Chick-Fil-A. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I adore Chick fil a and their staff! They are truly the most polite and courteous no matter how long or backed up they become they remail polite and upbeat the entire time! I tried the mobile order for the first time today and I LOVE it!! Very self explanatory and they were able to see my order and provide me a receipt! Its a great addition to an already awesome establishment!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here and i swear I have never been so upset. I came in at 5:05pm today ordered a side salad and some fries for one of our clients just to find our fries cold and super salty & the salad had a damn bug and a hair !! I cannot believe this . I called the store and the manager offered to make me another one or refund me the money for the salad not only do I live far but this will be double the gas! I drive a hemi v8 ughhhh"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A and go there often.  Their recent coupons for free items have expanded the items I like to order.  Always polite and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"I discovered Chick-fil-A 3 years ago and it's the best fast food I tried ever. I always go at this location because it's between work and home and it's nice to see always the same friendly face behind the counter :)
I really recommend the Chick-fil-A sauce, there Shakes and there AMAZING fries!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food in the area.  I've heard stories of people driving 2 hours to St. George Utah just for a chick-fil-a run, but at last they are here.

The chicken is always perfect and the waffle fries are excellent.  The also make a mean cookie.  The service has always been good and steadily getting better with the honeymoon coming to an end.  Welcome to Vegas Chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"One the worst Chick-fil-A I have been to in multiple states and in Nevada. This is the third time I have had an issue at this location. They never get an order right. They are always looking at their cell phones, not practicing Food Safety by touching their faces and then packing food in the back, and don't know how to handle cash and change properly. On top of this, the horrible attitude that comes from almost everyone in this location, including the managers, in unacceptable. I have made the mistake of coming to this location too many times."}
{"text":"The service from the staff is always very nice here, however, I'm pretty sure I just pulled half a worm out of the middle of my chicken breast. It has ridges like a worm, is the right diameter of a worm and the chicken itself wasn't really stuck to it. In fact, that's how I found it because it didn't pull apart like the meat. If this is a tendon it is the oddest tendon I've seen. I blame the source of the chicken, not the store,  of course. But Oh. My. God. I think I'm going to throw up."}
{"text":"Stopped here today for lunch. Good service, good food, good seating and parking area and good prices."}
{"text":"Around the West Towne mall area today and my stomach reminded me that it was time to eat. I really like Chick Fil A so in I go!

I ordered the classic combo - chicken sandwich, fries and medium soda. Total was $6.49. It can't be bad, can it???

No, it can't. 

If you've frequented Chick Fil A you know their service is above average. I had a young man who was training help me and he did everything right. Quick and efficient. Soda was in front of me before I handed my money over. Sat down after getting the necessary hot sauce (which is a MUST for me when eating here) and my food arrived within 60 seconds. 

The sandwiches are huge. This ain't no McDonald's chicken sandwich trying to be fancy. It's a huge piece of chicken breast on a delicious bun. Open it up, pour on the hot sauce, and I'm all set!

The fries are delicious although I'm not a fan of the super small \"break offs\" that you have to pick up like a claw machine game. Small struggle but enough to make me think about...

The sandwich is the star here. Moist, full of flavor and definitely satisfying. Anyone who thinks these sandwiches are bad is either unAmerican or have tastebud deficiency. It's really good and the price tag is fantastic. 

I only have two complaints about Chick Fil A. The breading, although delicious, always seems to be less crispy that desires. Maybe that's a personal preference. The other issue is styrofoam cups. I hate styrofoam cups, and I'm not an environmental soldier, but I know the environment hates styrofoam cups also. Small things in the grand scheme but big enough to keep the rating 4 stars instead of 5. 

Service here is amazing. The food is fantastic. Family friendly menu and prices. I think Chick Fil A is a great stop anytime of the day when your stomach reminds you its feeding time!!!"}
{"text":"We come here almost every Monday evening and my family and I love it. The service is great here all the employees are amazing and they are so polite."}
{"text":"All the great service and food you expect from a typical Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"Nasty, hate this place. Don't understand why people are obsessed with nasty fried chicken."}
{"text":"This CFA is solid but always very hectic! I don't think I've ever seen the drive through with less than 8 people in line. My recommendation is to use Chick-fil-A's awesome app. I've even tried ordering from the car, waiting a few minutes, and running inside to pick up my order. It's much faster than the drive through!"}
{"text":"Though I've lived close to this Chick-fil-A for nearly a year, I had never eaten here before. However, after a test at the Jefferson Regional Medical Center across the street last week, I decided that I deserved a breakfast treat and zipped through the drive-through. I would normally never rate a restaurant based on the drive-through, but this experience was literally my best ever. The service was fantastic. The lady that helped me was both very prompt, friendly, and polite. Not anything like the scary drive-through experiences that I've had in the past!"}
{"text":"I like Chick-fil-A, and this seems like your run-of-the-mill mall location. They are polite and prompt with consistent food. I came here last with my sister-in-law, who actually is a marketing director for a CFA in Tennessee. I would never have noticed it, but she was very upset by a black-and-white photo of a special Lenten-friendly sandwich in a temporary sign at the front of the restaurant, saying that printing the sign in B&W was positively embarrassing."}
{"text":"My friend and I popped in here tonight for milkshakes after an evening of shopping at IKEA. Consistent with other Chick-Fil-A restaurants, the employees are very kind and polite. I asked what ingredients were in a particular milkshake and was delighted to receive a little paper printout from the cashier. I had no idea Chick-Fil-A could do that!"}
{"text":"Went on grand opening day during dinner rush. Total wait time from start to finish was only an hour and there had to have been at least 100 cars in front of me. Expecting the wait I was completely impressed with the quality of food and service I received. All the staff were really friendly and they all seemed to be very well prepared and trained for it. Welcome to Las Vegas Chick-fil-a!!! I've waited over fifteen years for you to finally arrive."}
{"text":"This is the best Chick-fil-A I have been to! I have worked at a chick fil a before but this one is amazing! I've met the owner and he's a great guy and has a well trained and mannered staff! I am a picky eater but every time I order they get it just right and I never got an attitude from anyone there! I have been coming here since I was a kid and never once had an issue here! My experiences just keep getting better and better each time!"}
{"text":"I came through for lunch and the place was packed! Even when going through the drive-thru, I was in and out in less than 5 minutes! The chicken deluxe sandwich was perfect! I also had the cole slaw...at least before it leaves the menu!

Also my favorite thing about here is the diet lemonade! It's the best! And naturally the service here was great yet again. I'm happy to have this fast food establishment close to home!"}
{"text":"Many happy lunchtimes were spent at this Chick-Fil-A, conveniently located in the basement of the Cathedral of Learning. It was perfect for all of the Summer Language Institute students and is within walking distance from the dorm towers.

It is a smaller version of the chain restaurant, but carries almost all of the items on the nation-wide menus. My favorite will always be the little chicken nuggets with waffle fries and extra ranch sauce."}
{"text":"This particular Chik-fil-a is one of the best fast food establishments I've ever been too. The food is good, although I admit I always buy the chicken nuggets whenever I come. They're not greasy, soggy or salty. The coleslaw isn't that bad either. Refills are free.

 The customer service is what i really like about this place. The staff is friendly and smiles. A staff person will walk around and and ask dining customers if the food was okay or offer to get another refill or take away your tray. I have not witnessed any frowns are surly attitudes yet. This place gets extremely busy and crowded around lunch time yet the service remains consistent. 

I've never used the restroom but the dining area is clean and the condiment counter is organized. On some occasions there will be fresh flowers on the tables. 

Chik-fil-a gets 5-stars for their food and pleasant, professional service!"}
{"text":"By far the greatest service and nicest employees! One in particular that stands out is a very sweet girl there, she has awesome dreads and the prettiest smile! Always in a great mood and it spreads!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious.  We have ate here several times and I have not had any issues.  Staff is very polite and food comes out quick.  This place is ALWAYS packed but we have never waited long or anything like when you go to in-and-out drive thru.  I decided to leave a review because I have been here so many times and have never had an issue.  More chick-fil-A's please!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and had no issue but today they were less than average. The drive through line was long and no moving so I went inside to order and it was more of the same. I normally wouldn't complain if it looked as though everyone was moving around quickly and trying to get caught up but the total lack of urgency and leadership this morning was almost more than I could stand. Over a 15 minute wait for 1 chick fil a biscuit. Kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"Dear Chick Fil A 
Thank you for providing a bountiful lunch today. 
I heart dipping my waffle fries in your honey. 
Your 3 piece chicken strip meal can **almost** do no wrong. While I appreciate your use of real chicken, I do not really appreciate the greasy chicken glaze you leave on my fingers when I feast upon you. 
I appreciate you for having diet Dr. Pepper and bunny turd ice! 
Also, though I did not get the cole slaw today, it must be acknowledged! I am picky about my slaw, and yours is damn tasty! 
So thank you chick fil a! You are minutes away from my work and saved me from starving at my desk today!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Chick-fil-a? (Even if you could swear that it was spelled 'chik-fil-a') 

The food is flavorful, fresh and hot. Waffle fries are my kryptonite. I have been known to order just those for lunch. What I live the most is the staff. They really know how to hire at Chick-fil-a. These are the nicest people you would ever want to meet. 

The table decorations are so pretty with live, fresh flowers. The lobby is always clean and well stocked. It is always such a great experience here."}
{"text":"Always outstanding service here! And the yummy food is a bonus! However, today for some reason the drive-through line was slow. Even with a lot of traffic they typically get people through the line pretty quickly. I don't know what's going on today and it's a Saturday. Still gotta give 5 stars though cause this is atypical."}
{"text":"look the kids there before we went to see Hunger Games Mocking Jay... I had the best Chicken Sandwich Ever"}
{"text":"When it come to Fast Food it doesn't get any better than this. Fresh Chicken you can taste the difference 
Don't feel guilty feed this to the kids."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going here since I was a kid back in Ohio.  Everything is good on the menu. I wish they could come up with a way to keep the waffle fries warm longer. :-) People are always nice there who serve you. ALWAYS. It's most weird.  But nonetheless appreciated.  Which it was open on Sundays, but that's the Southern Baptist culture, and again, respected. Glad they are popping up everywhere."}
{"text":"The food is what you would expect. Grease dipped in grease, with a side of grease, topped off with a nice layer of grease. 
Can't understand why this place is so popular, it is so unhealthy. 
But customer service was good, just not big fan of the product."}
{"text":"Im only reviewing because i was surprised that not all locations offer the same drinks. Where im from, CFA has orange Fanta and Cherry Coke. Neither of which are at this location. :( Just disappointing when you are craving something."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with my fiance the 1st time in a long time. We came in around 7pm and it was busy. I order the spicy chicken meal which is spicy chicken, pickles, pepper jack chesse, lettuce, and tomato,Waffle firies with lemonade. The lemonade is freshly made and is the best out of all fast food. My fiance got the 12 count chicken with honey bbq dipping sauce. The staff was friendly, not over friendly. We got are food pretty fast considering of busy it was. The sandwich was very good and my fiance loved her chicken. I am not crazy about the waffle fries but they tasted pretty good with honey bbq sauce. Everytime someone left. A employee clean up the table. The with all the people the store was kept clean. Lastly I lover the mint melt away mints here. I will come back here when I want the best fast food chicken."}
{"text":"Honestly this place always hits the spot. For some reason I had a doubt about coming here.... 12pt chicken later in a satisfied customer. One thing I really like about this chain is how clean and welcoming they are. Second time at this location and I will be back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Their grilled nuggets and waffle fries are the best.  Try the honey roasted bbq sauce, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Very efficient and super friendly. It can be the busiest hour and they show no frustration during it. They treat everyone very nicely and always smiling."}
{"text":"If I could have only one fast food, this would be the place. I just love it. I don't normally eat fast food, but gosh, I gotta have a bad eat day every now and then and this is my place, besides they have a lot of healthy things on the menu so I guess it could be on my good days too!"}
{"text":"Aye there a couple time it's koo but damn they got some fine workers. It's 4 stars kuz chick fil a is a Mormon restaurant I'm not religious but you feel otherwise 5 stars"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had never had Chick-fil-A before so we swung through the drive-thru one rainy evening around 9 PM. I feel the same about pretty much every Chick-fil-A:
1) ugh, their politics
2) wow, these people are friendly
3) this is delicious
and then, about an hour or two later, 
4) why am I hungry again? 

Maybe it's the guilt that makes my body burn through it so fast? I don't know. I only end up eating here once every two to three years, and the quality has always been high for a fast food place. This is by far the friendliest of the friendly locations I've encountered, and it seemed genuine. The guy at the drive-thru window had a huge smile on his face and seemed to really like getting to interact with customers. 

Long story short: I don't agree with their corporate politics so I limit my visits, but the food is tasty, service is good, and it doesn't seem fair to knock the individual location for things out of their control."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and great customer service. It was also my first time trying chick-fil-a ever. Not only that the food was good the staff was so sweet and kind."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for catered meals for my weekend work with my team.............yes, they cater.

I usually cater breakfast and just do lunch on my own.  I grew up with these in my hometown of Asheville and the sandwiches are always great.

This place during lunch gets a line but MAN ARE THEY F A S T!!!!!!  It can be one of the busiest places in the sky way and also the fastest when it comes to gettting lunch.

Affordable, and like all fast food places continue to add healthy alternatives, this place is on my top 3 in the city.....when it comes to fast food mind you."}
{"text":"I love this chick fil a. The customer service is awesome. There are always employees asking if I need anything and making sure I am satisfied. Obviously a great place for kids. The outdoor space and playground is nice and well kept."}
{"text":"First time I tried this place~ WOW!!! Chicken was off the charts! And the honey mustard???? Fabulous!!! Try it!!! You'll like it!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here since I live in Las Vegas and it was pretty good! 
Service was okay, nothing too great.
I got a spicy chicken sandwich and boy was that good! It was so juicy and crispy, it's like the chicken sandwich I always wanted but never got. It was more on the mild side but it was better than no spice at all. Next time I'll try the original sandwich. Waffle fries were good, it all went together with the chick-Fil-a sauce. My experience was overall awesome and I would love to go again if I lived closer to one :("}
{"text":"Chick-fail-A has never done me wrong. We know the number 1 is the best and lemonade is always good."}
{"text":"I made a catering phone order last week and was highly disappointed. I purchased 2 trays of the mini sandwiches. When I picked them up, I was told that they are best eaten fresh and that the bread would get hard if they are left out. Considering I had 2.5 hours until my event, I asked how to best preserve them. They said I would be unable to and not eating them right away could result in them getting stale. Basically, I ended up giving the trays to friends while they were still hot and not using them for my event. $65 bucks down the tubes. You think they could have mentioned that to me at the time of my phone order."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Chick Fil A because of a disastrous catering experience at a different location. Danielle helped me with a last minute strip and nugget tray that only took about 15 minutes to put together. The chicken was piping hot and smelled great. A huge hit at my event!  I felt the need to do a review because Danielle was so great. She offered many items (mints, hand wipes, serving utensils, extra napkins and dipping sauces, etc) without asking and even gave me an advertising stuffed cow in appreciation of my order. Would definitely go to this location again!"}
{"text":"It is currently closed for renovations. Hope they work fast & get it back up & running soon. For now, have to get your fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love chickfila!! They have great food.  I like the sauces that they give you for the nuggets and sandwiches.  They are finally opening one in Las Vegas, yippee!  I am from the east coast so we have them everywhere.  Employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"We are so excited that Chickfila finally opened up a location in Henderson Nevada. We drive up to St. George normally to get our fix. 
     
      The food was great as usual they always get our orders right.  We ordered 2 chickfila sandwiches, 1deluxe chickfila sandwich, waffle fries, and grilled nuggets. The staff was friendly and pleasant.  They have a nice play area for small children which is awesome for my toddlers.  

      We will be coming here very often.  I love that they respect their employees and give them off Sundays."}
{"text":"I normally love chick fi lay but this time I'm just confused and disappointed. I ordered the gluten free club chicken sand witch with no cheese. What I received what disheartening. I opened up the package, I got tomato, lettuce, one piece of bacon, AND NO CHICKEN. THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE CHICKEN IN MY SANDWICH. I'm just soooo pissed. Like HOW????? I get mistakes, but the most important part?? HOW. I just want answers lmao. Do not go to this location. You'd just get fi lay. No chicken."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service.  We hit up the drive through for a quick lunch before heading to a work meeting after landing in Phoenix.  I hadn't had Chick-fil-A in years, so I went with the classic chicken sandwich for my meal.  I didn't realize that it was deep-fried, so that probably wasn't the healthiest thing to eat...  but it was tasty and delicious and definitely hit the spot.  Just ordering the sandwich alone without anything else made me feel a teeny bit healthier, as I told myself I was eating fewer calories, LOL.  There was enough protein to keep me full until dinnertime, so definitely a good lunch when on the go!"}
{"text":"I got the wrap last night with a side of honey mustard, totally worth it. Only 4 stars because an employee had to stand outside in the midst of a sandstorm to take our order. Please guys it 2017 get an intercom system, it's just not nice. If I didn't mention it before the food was great!"}
{"text":"I am from the east coast and Chick-fil-a's are everywhere. I simply love chick-fil-a and I will always be a fan. 

I visited this location one tuesday morning before work to get me a wheat bagel sandwich with chicken and cheese with a side of hash browns. It took no time for me to order, pay, and receive my food. The workers were pretty happy as all chick-fil-a workers are. However; my reason behind the 4 stars and not 5 is because I waited to eat  my food until I go to work and I was simply disappointed. 

My food was hot and fresh and my hash browns were simply fired to golden perfection, however; I had the smallest piece of chicken on my sandwich. The chicken was so small that all I really tasted was cheese and bread. This looked more one of their nuggets than a chicken breast. If my chicken would have been bigger to fit in my bagel then I would have gladly provided 5 stars. I'll defiantly give this location another chance to redeem themselves on the lunch menu, so ill update my review then.

Until next time......"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is one of my all time favorites. I have always had remarkable service here and no matter the location the food is amazing. I love their Chick-fil-a sauce and the sweet polynesian sauce. I also love their delicious waffle fries and the kids bendy straws.

I grew up in North Carolina and I have always ate at Chick-fil-a and have never been disappointed with my service or food ever. Once I heard of serval locations opening in the valley, I knew I had to get my fix. It's not addicting but the food is good, the food is fresh and the service is great. 

I usually order a number 1 - Chicken sandwich with no pickles add American cheese, fries and a fruit punch no ice or their delicious lemonade. 

I have tried almost every on the menu and honestly everything is good. My favorite is the sandwich but every now and then I will get a count meal.

It would be amazing if they could put a Chick-fil-a in Summerlin, that way I don't have to drive a long way to get some yummy chicken."}
{"text":"You can usually find a line coming out of this place during weekday lunches and breakfast. I was lucky enough that this morning there wasn't.  I got my chicken minis hot and fresh. My only complaint as always is why don't they serve chicken minis all day?"}
{"text":"Quick and efficient drive thru.  Driving entrance is not ideal.  I missed it going south on Rancho.  And had to drive back on Sahara West.  It's probably the easiest way to find.  West on Sahara, Right on Rancho, and first driveway on the right.  Food is good.  Rating 5 stars on quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"I really wished we had one in Vegas, but maybe that's why it's much more delicious since we don't have it. I am a sucker for their nuggets....yum! The only thing about this place is that it is closed on Sundays. BOO and we have to go up to the counter for refills. BUT really who can resist some waffle fries dipped in a variety of dipping sauces? YUMMY!  Service is always good and every Chick fil A I've been to is clean. Yay for good chicken and fries! 

PS. Try the soft ice cream...that's pretty delicious too!"}
{"text":"Fast food chicken sandwiches and nuggets that are unique and tasty.

We love having the Chic-Fil-A in the area for a quick lunch (or breakfast) bite. The chicken (I'm talking about the fried chicken, not the lame grilled stuff) has a sweetness to the breading that is really tasty - I assume it is some manner of addictive drug).

The lemonade should not be overlooked, either. It is a great thirst quencher that is a perfect balance of sweet and sour.

For breakfast, the Chicken Minis - nuggets in a tiny sweet roll - are fantastic as soon as you can get past chicken for breakfast. If you can't, though, the sausage biscuits are very good, too."}
{"text":"Great place! They help out with so many fundraiser, which I definitely applaud. Like most...I wish it was open on Sundays"}
{"text":"I've gone to this Chick-Fil-A over 40 times since 2015. Great service, quick food & great diet lemonade."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this location since the first day they opened for business.  I am always greeted by a friendly employee and of course the food is always great. By far my favorite Chick-fil-et location. If you don't already have the Chick-fil-et app on your phone. please do your self a favor and get it. Points are easily accumulated and as a bonus you will receive random free treats easily assecible with the app."}
{"text":"Although I feel kind of dumb reviewing a nationwide chain, this Chick-Fil-A did not disappoint when it came to catering my workplace's holiday party. Tons of nuggets, salad, little chicken sandwiches and wraps, and fruit came fresh, hot and on time. I personally ate around one thousand nuggets."}

{"text":"I love the chicken here. It is delicious! They have such a great team that provides extraordinary service to the community of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, my heart skipped a beat and a single tear of joy streamed down my cheek. What can I say?! The staff is always so friendly! The food has never failed me. I love this place. I honestly love this place. This is the king of all fast food! All hail Chick-Fil-A!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite fast food joint! I love love love their chicken! I always get their number 1 meal. It's their basic chicken sandwich with the world famous waffle fries. The customer service that you get their is stellar!  Oh, and they have the best sweet tea ever!"}
{"text":"I would give the food a five because their chicken is unmatched. I am  not factoring in any hateful thoughts by owners and executives of this company. Which I do not agree with. I drop a star because this location was like a three ring circus with children bouncing over every square inch of the place. Screaming children clutching waffle fries as they smeared grease all over the walls and tables. So, if you want to have lunch and forget you are a parent for an hour, this is your place. Just set your child free in the gym area and eat your chicken sandwich while your child leaps unsupervised into the ball room. If the zoo is closed, sit at the table next to the observation window of the playroom. Same thing."}
{"text":"What's the big deal? I finally went here and had the most boring chicken sandwich of my life with some salty waffle fries and watered down sweet tea. I don't see any reason to come back here considering the nearby chicken competition. The chicken breast in the sandwich was good quality, just not much flavor. The chicken strips we got my daughter were laughably bad. Same texture like if they were microwaved. Nothing here for me for me to crave."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fast food - not to be pretentious because we all have our vices. I happen to prefer to indulge in sweets, like cake and candy and sometimes ice cream. My kids and I often go to McDonald's (or as they call it, \"the ice cream store\") to eat vanilla cones. And then I sit on my phone and read E!News while they crawl through the tunnels.

They wanted to go to a \"new ice cream store\" today so we went an extra mile to Chick-Fil-A.  I ordered our typical cones and then my 4-year old son blurted out that he wanted chocolate.

Well, of course the only soft serve option is vanilla. I had a brief flashback of  the good old days when McDonald's offered chocolate soft serve....and even better, my personal favorite, swirl.

So, I asked if they had any chocolate syrup because we would take some and she said no, they could not do that.  But then a man from behind her said, \"yes, we can. we can blend some up.\"

And that is exactly what he did!  Our first 2 vanilla cones (that we ordered and paid for) were delivered to us promptly.  And  then a few minutes later, a huge cup of chocolate ice cream was delivered to us as well.  And it had a large cone sticking out of it.

I felt like I needed to pay for it, but he said absolutely not.  And whatever this chocolate concoction was, it was really really good.  Like a Frostie, and maybe even better.

I am not sure of the last time I got such good customer service, although I am sure that it was not a fast food established.   So 5 stars to  them for delivering something that was not on the menu (and for no cost!) to make a kid happy.  And the very clean play area, free from the stench of urine, was just the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Ok I love Chick-fil-a but what is up with this place being so stingy with sauce??? I come back to Chick-fil-a for the sauces and now I can only get 2???? Like wth are you serious!!!! This sucks!!!! Give us sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I come here all the time and it's good service but i came in yesterday and received exceptional service ! Raiza was so charismatic and sweet. She made my experience memorable and one for the books. Can't wait to come back just to get greeted by the same delightful face!! Thank you once again to her wonderful customer service !!"}
{"text":"Ok Chick-fil-A, you've finally got me. I'm officially a fan of your delicious chickity goodness. Want to know which glorious item finally sealed the deal? It was the grilled chicken sandwich. I know I know, such a simple sandwich, but I can honestly say I've never had a better chicken sandwich in my life! Not to mention, most fast food joints will serve sandwiches and burgers that leave you feeling groggy and ready for a nap. Not this place though. After I had the grilled chicken sandwich for lunch, I was ready to power through the rest of my day with my hunger satisfied, but not weighing me down. Oh and I can't forget to mention the variety of sauces they have to add to your chicken selection. From a sweet and spicy sriracha sauce to buffalo to even a sauce of their own known as the chick-fil-a sauce, the options are endless for any customer who wants to add a little variety to their lunch! Nice work Chick-Fil-A! This is one customer that will certainly be back in the future."}
{"text":"This is the best location of theirs I've been to.  Great and I mean GREAT customer service from beginning to end.  Kids area is well kept and the staff is very accommodating to the little ones.  I am a big fan of chickfila already, this place just validates my thought process.  

Well done!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here one day while in Charlotte. Ordered their Chicken Tortilla soup and some of their Chicken nuggets.

Soup was tasty and hot! The nuggets tasted texture-wise like they had been sitting for a bit. The Buffalo dipping sauce was pretty good.

Very popular lunch place - place was packed!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness Chick-fil-A is now in Las Vegas! The line for drive thru and dine in was crazy, but the drive thru was well managed for a busy Saturday. Always friendly, always fast."}
{"text":"I used to love chick fil a. I went there a few weeks ago after work one night. Service was great and all, but as I got to eating my fries, there was a weird taste to them. I spit the fry out and it was covered in mold!!! Definetly will not be returning."}
{"text":"It is really good! Especially their chicken noodle soup! Yummmm"}
{"text":"UPDATE: you no longer sale your lunch menu all day. You will no longer get my business. We dont like breakfast items, so we choose your restaurant. We went to order chick fil a sandwiches only to find out we cant until after 10:30. Worst desicsion you have made."}
{"text":"After exhausting myself exploring Total Wine I walked out the door and I was famished!! *growl goes my tummy*
I walked out the door and low and behold I looked up and to my right and there it was::: Aaaaahhhh!!!!!! Chick-fil-A!!
I couldn't get there fast enough! 
As always my experience at each Chick-fil-A always begins with a very welcoming, sunshiny(even at night!), happy greeting... this was no exception.
from the perfectly crisp waffle fries, to my chicken sandwich with extra pickles to the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed employees... I can always count on familiarity even when I'm out if town on vacation.
Thank You Chick-fil-A for doing a swell job!!! 
Your employees are some of the best!!!

oh and a quick note:  if Ya'all (using my southern accent I picked up last week in Memphis) haven't tried the Frosted Lemonade...oohhhh.. you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"My friends make fun of me for loving this restaurant so much.  I realize that calling it a restaurant is a bit of a stretch, however, this location makes it easy to forget they are fast food.

Food:
Most \"fast food\" places have a large variety of things to choose from.  Chick-fil-A keeps it simple. They have the best chicken sandwiches on the planet, and they must know it since it is 50% of their menu. I don't particularly like chicken sandwiches, but the ones they make are incredible. Don't forget the buffalo sauce.

Atmosphere and Staff:
Inside is always clean, and the decor is comfy.  They keep the AC around 70-72 degrees and some might find it a bit chilly. The management seems to be doing a excellent job. The staff seems to enjoy their work, and even when the place is packed, I have never waited long for my order. 

They even have a play area for the kids!

What could be better?: 
They are closed on Sundays (I often forget)."}
{"text":"This place is in a hard area. There are thousands of hungry business people and traffic is horrible. But somehow they get you through with decent speed. Is it the fastest? No prob not. But come on they serve more people in a day I bet! If you want a fast experience. Get the app and load money. You can pre-order and have it waiting for you! I give these guys props because this place is never not a zoo."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Chic-fil-a. This one is no different. Great service. Consistent with the other locations."}
{"text":"Personal opinion but you can't go wrong here. Great service and consistent product. Whether it's the sandwiches, the nuggets or the tenders they are great! The ice cream isn't my favorite but doesn't matter. Too many other good things to talk about."}
{"text":"These guys are seriously amazing. I am super impressed with the drive through times. I don't think I've ever waited very long at all. Today they had 3 people outside that walk rights up the second you get in line and help you. It's amazing. Remind me the next time I open my own restaurant to duplicate their customer service model. Love it!"}
{"text":"Pretty tried and true. Super consistent service and food. I've literally never had a bad experience which maybe inevitable but till then...awesome. I stick with the standard. Chick-fil-a sandwich."}
{"text":"I wish I could give you zero stars, I really do. I wish that I could say your employees operate with the their brains but it seems they do not. I'm so disappointed in the fact that every single time I've been here the employees give you single sauces and soggy food. I ask for extra sauce and they hand me one single sauce it almost seems funny to them. I literally have to request for my chicken to be well done so it's the least bit crispy. Shame on you for not showing any hospitality past your shallow forced, \"my pleasures.\""}
{"text":"I went haywire when I found out Chick-Fil-A was going to be out here in Vegas. We always want something we can't have, don't we?
The spicy chicken is my go-to sandwich, and I just love how fresh their chicken tastes.

My original favorite is their grilled chicken sandwich. Just to emphasize how well it's made here, I wanna point out that for one, chicken is my LEAST favorite meat. And secondly, GRILLED chicken is also my LEAST favorite way that I want it cooked. 

But man. That chicken. What do they do to it to make it so juicy and tender. I feel that juice squirt action when I bite in. 

I love their honey bbq packet sauce the best, over all the other sauces, including the chik-fil-a sauce. 

GET IN MAH BELLYYYYYY."}
{"text":"This location prides itself on being the fastest drive through in the area and I couldn't agree more. My husband and I stop by when we need good food fast and the drive through never disappoints. We are in and out within minutes. He enjoys the spicy chicken sandwiches and they are always fresh. I like some of their healthier options such as the chicken soup and especially the new kale salad. It is delicious with chopped kale cherries and nuts. Their grilled chicken nuggets are great too and a nice alternative to something fried. To top it off the employees are very friendly and helpful. I love the little cows they have too!"}
{"text":"But for the customer service, this is a regular Chick-fil-A.

A \"regular Chick-fil-A\" is a compliment!  It means that the food is addictive (I've switched from the regular Chick-fil-A sandwich to the chicken nuggets, which are amazing, and much better than McDonald's or the like) and the restaurant itself is nice, with attractive furnishings, and very clean.

This location, though, seems to have among the friendliest employees of any location I've been to--and I've been to at least dozens of locations.  CFA usually has very nice and very polite people, but this one is just a cut above.

(Sidenote: this location is always PACKED- the parking lot can be totally full even at 3pm.  Where all those people come from, I have no idea, but I'm always still in and out in just a few minutes; there's little to no wait once you're inside, so don't let the packed parking lot run you off. If you're driving down I-85, just turn off and head south at exit 27; you'll be back on the road really quickly.)"}
{"text":"Very clean and great service. Great place to bring the kids. 

The staff is great kind and helpful and always with a smile. They can be busy at times but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is always so packed but don't let it fool you,  they are fast! The staff is friendly and if we ever had an issue they've corrected it right away. I love this place! The spicy chicken is tasty and not your \"regular\" spicy chicken sandwich. Definitely one of my favorite places. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The best fast food anywhere!  These chicken sandwiches are addictive.  I love the family atmosphere.  Great place!"}
{"text":"FINALLY is probably the word that comes to everyone's mind. Even after at least a month since opening, they still have people outside directing traffic during peak hours, which is great, but also horrible because of the line. Don't be lazy and do drive thru. If you park and walk in, it'll be so much faster. I've never waited more than 10 minutes when I walk in. 
Chicken sandwich: Don't spend extra to get the lettuce tomatoes and cheese that comes with the fancier sandwich. Get the simple and plain, fried sandwich. 
Waffles fries: Waffle fries are a must. My favorite sauces are the Chik fil A sauce and Polynesian. Chicken fil A is a yellow sauce, Polynesian and slightly sweet red. 
Don't forget they're closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"The line is a little slow I'm sure due to it being new and teenagers first jobs. So far I've had great customer service and they always get my order right. Happy to have a location closer to me."}
{"text":"Worst Chick-fil-A ever in my whole life.
We're only customer but waited 5 min to order. Got our order wrong. Did not put whip cream in chocolate milkshake. Dirtiest chick-fil-a ever been in."}
{"text":"I love Chick Fil A... but I will NEVER be going to this location again. This month, the San Tan location is doing a free breakfast for customer appreciation once a week... although I do not get the feeling they actually appreciate their customers. They don't advertise this anywhere and only posted about it on Facebook once a few weeks before it started. They really need to up their social media game- the Queen Creek location does a GREAT job of letting people know what's going on! 
Anyways, I left the office to pick up the free breakfasts for my coworkers and I. When I pulled up to the window, a man came to the window in a dirty t-shirt who honestly did not look like an employee. He looks in my car and says I can only get one entree because the other two weren't physically there. He didn't apologize for the inconvenience and was very smug in his response to me. That's fine if that's the policy, but why not make it known somewhere during this promotion so I don't waste my time? Also, if the whole promotion is about customer appreciation, you should probably treat your customers with respect. I'm really disappointed... and will drive to the Power location for future visits. In my experience, it's much faster, happier, and cleaner overall."}
{"text":"Chick Fil A is always great, but I must admit this location is superb. We went for lunch on a busy Saturday. The line went quickly due to employees working at every register and we got our food in no time! There were tons of employees working, cleaning, delivering food, and giving out refills as well. If I have a choice to go to this location or San Tan, I would DEFINITELY choose this location!"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A, I'm so happy you are here!! 

Growing up in Southern California, CFA was my first job in high school. I was around it all the time and I got sick of it. After moving to Vegas almost 11 years ago, I started to miss the delicious chicken and sauces. My cravings would only be fulfilled every couple months when I went back home to SoCal to visit my family. Now, it's a 10 minute drive from my place and I can have it whenever I want!! 

I decided to skip the craziness of opening day and waited about 2 weeks to get my CFA fix. The menu has changed a bit since I worked there, but for the better. They still have the OG items like the CFA sandwich, the nuggets and the strips. They have added a few new players to the menu like the spicy sandwich, milkshakes and breakfast items. And they've added grilled chicken items for all the health conscious people as well. The chicken and fries still have the crispy delicious flavor I remember. The milkshakes are nice and thick. The salads are fresh and healthy alternative. And don't forget all the sauces for your chicken. My personal favorites are the ranch, Polynesian and honey BBQ. 

Despite how busy it still is, the employees are super friendly and efficient. The store itself is clean and so is the kids play area. I still suggest going inside rather than waiting in the long drive through line. Every visit, I've been in and out in 10 minutes. 

They now have an app to order so you can get your food even faster!! I've heard a lot of people say that CFA is over-hyped, which is fine with me. That just means less people in my way!! I look forward to many more visits in my future."}
{"text":"Most Chick-Fil-A's get 5 stars. This one gets 2, deducted one star for each time my order has been wrong in the last 3 visits. First, order a sandwich and nuggets, got a sandwich and fries. Next time, ordered two spicy sandwiches, got two regular ones, also asked for mayo, got 1 packet, um.... Tonight, ordered 1 spicy, 1 regular, was told I had to pull aside and wait for the spicy (no big deal), I said \"No problem, just please remember the mayo\". They brought the order to me, I quickly checked to see if it wasz there (no mayo), I look up, she's gone (gee, thanks, I waited for you). Love this place, wax excited to get one on my route home, but Im not coming back to this one. Terrible management when you cant get your product out correctly."}
{"text":"Best service at a fast food restaurant that anyone could ever ask for. Would recommend this place to anyone. The food is just fantastic. My only wish is to have this place closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Clean, family friendly, fast, superior service, and awesome food. Made a complaint one time to the manager about family night. The next time they did that activity during family night they had addressed my complaint! We are frequent customers for life!"}
{"text":"clean, friendly staff, nice play area.  all in all a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken sandwich. Waffle fries. Arnold palmer. DO IT. And use the app. In and out in under ten minutes. Thank you Chick-fil-A for sucking up your pride and coming to sin city"}
{"text":"Very unfriendly staff, inquired about a military discount, which most chick fil a's that I have been to offer, and the woman just gave me a dirty look and said no. Didn't bother to ask a manager or anything, and it's usually just the police discount, which our military service members definitely (at least) deserve. Not going here anymore."}
{"text":"Love love love chick-fil-a! The ambiance in their casual dining area really wowed me. Pleasant crowd in dining room as well. Fast hot fresh and consistent food as always. Their employees walk around and ask if you would like refills on your beverages. Drive through also very fast and efficient. I do recommend some form of shade for employees working outside in drive through area for summer however."}
{"text":"After finally trying this place, it was a total disappointment. It is not as good as everyone claims. It regular food nothing special. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The sauce is tastier than the food. The attitude of the staff and their obvious ineptitude to not show favoritism to race creed or color was unfathomably rude and incomprehensible. We were forced to carry our own food tray EVERYONE else of non-color had tableservice flowers were being put out on all tables except ours we were told by a manager that was breaking for lunch that they didn't want to disturb us I have never been disturbed by a flower in my life I would've enjoyed a fresh flower at my table and the fact that we were further insulted by the manager with him telling us that \"we would be disturbed by the flowers\" is without a doubt insulting to one's intelligence. I married an Asian man and have the most beautiful biracial children of Asian /American ethnicity. My husband a General Manager of a local hotel and I myself prior military find this restaurant unacceptable. I don't recommend this restaurant for a family friendly atmosphere if you have to eat it, you better be prepared to Don a blond wig and some blue contacts or simply drive-thru, Me personally next time I'll be ONLY driving by."}
{"text":"I like when the people at a fast food place are happy. Knowing that the people making my spicy chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese on a golden wheat bun  and a side of chicken nuggets are working AND don't hate their life really makes it taste that much better. Also, it is a small inspiration that my job probably isn't all that bad either, and you can't put that kind of mental high five on the menu. If I'm eating fast food chicken, it better be Chick-Fil-A, and this location is one of the best around."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and good, no problems from that side.  

The problem I have with this one is that I HATE pickles and when I order a spicy a chicken plain what im assuming they do is just remove the pickles from the sandwhich and re wrap it? Because about out of the 5 times ive gone here 3 of the times my sandwhichs taste like they dunked the whole thing in a jar of pickle juice. 

So im sitting here now, just spent about 8 dollars on two sandwhichs, and take a bite to find out the cooks are being lazy and had pickles on my sandwhich at one point and just removed them and gave it to me. You guys really need to stop doing that, I literally almost threw up at work from this nastyness. I had to through all my food away... 

lets take a moment of silence for my 8 dollars that I will never see again... RIP you will be missed. 

So if management is reading this please tell the staff to stop being lazy. 

This one can not be trusted and ill never come to this franchise again. I know they dont care but im that disappointed lol."}
{"text":"Great service! Very smooth with group of 20!! Garrick the owner was there and very friendly! Along with friendly staff! Great experience and food!"}
{"text":"Customer service is not the best and most of the workers are pretty rude. Undercooked fries after waiting for a long time just seems unreasonable to me."}
{"text":"Whew so happy to finally get out of here with my coffee... this Chick-fil-A has never impressed me with their service. I'm a raving fan of Chick-fil-A but after today's mess i have to review this location. The cashiers have never been that friendly (not the level I would expect from a CFA) and they also don't seem to be trained well as they struggle to enter in my order and heaven forbid I throw them a curveball like light ice, it adds on plenty of time of them trying to type. Today the cashier repeated mine and my husband's order literally 5 times... \"so a hot coffee and an iced coffee.... Oh what size hot coffee?\" Then once she struggled to enter it in, repeated the order. I corrected her saying for the second time I wanted light ice and no sugar in my iced coffee. Ohhhh man did that throw her off in entering that in. 
While we are standing to the side waiting for our coffees and seeing no one making any coffees (to be fair it was picking up at lunch time), a nice old lady came out and asked what kind of cream I wanted in my coffee. I replied with \"whatever normally comes in it.\" She then leaves and comes back and says \"Ice cream comes in it.\" I said, \"what? I wanted an iced coffee.\" We then check the receipt and I indeed ordered an iced coffee. The lady seems confused and goes back. We then see her take out some food orders and clean some tables and I still don't see anyone making me a coffee. We are going on 15 minutes here and I grab a guy walking by and ask him for our coffees. He goes back and is talking with a supervisor. He finally comes back with a black iced coffee.... I said I wanted cream. He goes back and hands me 2 creamers. I have to go back to work so I leave while my husband stays waiting for his coffee. He later told me it took an additional 10 minutes to get his hot coffee because they had to brew more but they didn't even start brewing it til he asked another guy about his coffee. Then he saw a guy pour all of the hot coffee into a container and take it to the back.... hmm makes me question my \"cold brew\" coffee. Then the guy puts on a new pot."}
{"text":"My Chick-fil-A of choice! (I'm clearly a raving fan)
Food and service has been top-notch every time. This is also such a pretty Chick-fil-A, it's got a big glass window to the back prep table so you can see them cooking and preparing food. Everything seems shiny and new. If you're new to Chick-fil-A I would recommend trying all the sauces but if you want to save time just get the Chick-fil-a sauce because the secret ingredient is Truett Cathy's ashes (hurry before they run out of ashes!)."}
{"text":"Everyone is very nice and polite and they seem happy in their job. I would suggest trying to extend breakfast hours to either all day Saturday's at the very least or until 11 every day. It's nice they call you by your name too. The chick sauce is to die for I could probably drink it. And while I miss going there on Sundays I respect that they close for religious observances. While some People think the styrofoam cup is an environment killer I continue to love it because in the deadly Phoenix summer it prevents your Diet Coke from getting too watered down and melting too fast."}
{"text":"Totally loved this place .. so glad they finally opened up in Vegas! Best fast chicken place loved it"}
{"text":"Pleasant experience, thought I was gonna be waiting in line forever, but that wasn't the case! The most we waited was like 10 minutes I think, when line was out the door. Found a booth to sit right away and got our food in less than 5 minutes. People are in and out, Chic Fil A staff seemed very efficient, provided great and fast service. The restaurant is spacious, with staff thats always cleaning. Every table had a bouquet of fresh flowers, which I thought it was neat 
Chicken, chicken, chicken! 
Tried the grilled chicken nuggets, they were meh. The spicy deluxe sandwich was yummy with the waffle fries! Also, they have 7 different sauces to choose from  

I always drive this place, and the drive thru line is always is insane!
But I'll probably give it a try lol"}
{"text":"I've never waited so long for drive through in my life. Get your act together chick fil a!!!"}
{"text":"I despise this place. Slower than molasses. 

Poor service but the crushed ice is here."}
{"text":"This location does NOT have cherry coke, nor chipped small ice.  :( 

Dear Lord, Yelp isalong me write more so no one will read. 
Okay, the drive thru is built so you're stuck and can't get out if you can't order what you like.  It's long enough to sike you into believing it's not busy busy but it is. 

Just go to PDQ"}
{"text":"Service 5 Food 3

As always with CFA, employees are fantastic.

This is about the chicken biscuit. If you go in expecting the chicken biscuit you had in Atlanta or Myrtle Beach,you are going to be sad and maybe a little hurt. 

The first biscuit was quite dark and didn't look like the CFA biscuit I am used too. The chicken was really thin. The next one was a bit better with the chicken being a little bigger. If I were jonesing for a chicken biscuit,this would be okay. I wanted a Chick File A Chicken Biscuit,didn't get it.

Not sure what gets lost once this company crosses the Mississippi River, but the breakfast here and in California are just not as good. 

My  22 year wait for a Nevada Chick Fil A was super underwhelming."}
{"text":"It was absolutely amazing food was served fast. Good waffle fries. I got the deluxe 2 and the chicken was juicy and so good. Average is about 7 to 8 dollars a meal."}
{"text":"The difference in quality between this one and the Belmont location is astounding. Almost like two different restaurants. My chicken sandwich was rubbery and I could barely chew it, like it been left out all day or something. Do yourself a favor and just drive to Belmont if you want chick fil a."}
{"text":"Second straight time I've been to this location where my large fries was filled 2/3 of the way. Kind of annoying when I'm paying for a large and get a medium."}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast at 10:22 am. I requested and my receipt reflects an egg white grill on a biscuit. Wes, my server charged me for a large coffee, which i didn't order. My receipt also reflects dine in yet my food was not delivered to me. 

I received my order after 10:30 which is fine however it was incorrect so when i asked to have it fixed the manager Nick said breakfast is over and they're not making any biscuits but I could order lunch.  

I did not drag my kid and I to Chick Fil A to be the first to order lunch. I can eat waffle cut fries and drink lemonade from 10:30 am until 11 pm. 

My time and money has been wasted"}
{"text":"Poor service, over 20 minute wait in drive thru. Staff was dysfunctional  and lacked leadership. Management was clueless. Stay far away from this establishment if you can!! Extremely disappointed in this Chic filet.."}
{"text":"I do love Chick-Fil-A but I am honestly extreme annoyed with the service here. I tried to use the App to place an order which is an exercise in aggravation. Starbucks did it right & it works great. With Chick-Fil-A placing a mobile order is a 30 minute ordeal. And picking up the order is a whole different ordeal. Today I attempted to pick up my mobile order via the drive-thru - I already had the alert notifying me that the order was ready for pick up. All they had to do was hand it to me. The girl said that her manager said that I have to go inside. After waiting through the drive through queue because there's no way out of the line, I went inside and waited 15-20 minutes for them to get me the order. Then I was lucky enough to have cold food when I got home. Awful and disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the worst chick-fil-a I have ever visited. Service is terrible. The lines are always long and take forever to get through."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this location offers such a mediocre experience in comparison to the typical Chick-fil-A. They have two lanes in the drive-thru but the second is never open. Their pick-up area inside is almost right in front of the door, so when they're busy, such as when the high school across the street has a game, there's a crowd blocking the door. I don't think they've been trained on the concept of \"light ice\". Employees are always courteous, but there seems to be a lot of movement with not much output. It's like this restaurant has been designed and trained by another chain of restaurants (possibly IHOP)."}
{"text":"Every time I come I get the same thing, a chicken sandwich, large waffle fries and a sweet tea. This time I opted for the lemonade, which is AMAZING! The lines are always long but your in and out in a timely manner. I recommend this particular one because they stay fully staffed and the employees are extremely nice."}
{"text":"Overall: Very good food and excellent service.  I've only used the drive through when it's not 15 cars long.

Food: 4 stars.  I was surprised how good the chicken sandwiches and chicken nuggets were.  The choice of sauces are excellent.  The milkshake was excellent too.  My only issue is they don't have many choices for cheese on the sandwich, like provolone and Swiss.

Service: 5 stars. I've always received great service.  They even give dog treats.  They also did a fundraiser for my church.

Prices: 4 stars.  Seem reasonable."}
{"text":"When I lived close to this Chik-fil-a I used to go at least once a week. Even though you might see a long line in the drive-thru it is usually a short wait. They do a good job keeping the dining area clean even though it gets really busy during the day."}
{"text":"Everything I loved about Chic Fil A from being in Atlanta is FIBALLY here in Vegas. 

I LOVE that they have a system for getting through the long lines, however it wasn't great when 3-5 cars got their food from the portable workers in the line, much more assertive than In & out btw, but the one car at the window is still there food less. I see this quite a bit in Vegas, MOVE THAT CAR TO THE SIDE. Get the other smaller or easier orders out so there isn't a huge line to manage in a small parking lot. There were already delivering orders outside in drive thru, so just have someone bring their food to them. Especially when you have those orders fulfilled behind that car. Other than that, good food, despite whatever the owners believe."}
{"text":"I eat here way, way too often. At first I didn't think anything of it. \"A place that only sells chicken? Stupid\". But alas, they came out with the spicy chicken and it changed my life. Literally, as good as it gets. 

Always fast and friendly. 

Even though I'm rating 5 stars, I do have to say, there are two major complaints I have. I really hope the staff and managers read this. 

1) STOP telling me it's your pleasure after every time I say thanks. I know it's not \"your pleasure\" because you are all forced to say it. Pretty much takes the courtesy out of it. 

2) Hire some brown people, jesus christ. Every food place hires mexicans except you guys? You expect me to believe that no mexicans have applied? I feel like I'm showing up to a klan meeting when 100% of the people there are white, in ARIZONA!"}
{"text":"I love eating at this place. The first time I ever ate at a Chick-fil-A was when I was like 12 years old in Georgia and it was amazing. This location does a great job of mimicking the Excellence of all the other locations. I always get one of their grilled sandwiches because I love grilled chicken sandwiches. I've also had their little nugget and basically everything tastes good dipped in their Chick Fil-A sauce. The Criss cut fries are amazing also good dipped in Chick-fil-A sauce. My fiance like the spicy buffalo sauce which he ate with criss cut fries and a grilled chicken sandwich that I picked up for him. The service is Speedy and it always comes with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"WOW! WE usually don't eat at these places because of the types of people they are and what we hear about them from others. But We decided to try them out, the wait was horrible and the greeter they has greeting people she was just a little prissy and had an attitude. WE ordered two chicken sandwiches and when we opened them they looked WAY overcooked and very hard to eat. (I will try and post a picture of them) Ask a manager about them and he said \"Sorry we are a little busy and I can't do anything to help you, nest time come back when were not so busy or try a different menu item, Let me tell you RUDE RUDE customer serve and horrible chicken. YUCK!!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-a.  Not this one, though.  Almost as dirty as a Waffle House."}
{"text":"Great food, and I usually love the great service. That was until the manager gave me the stink eye for taking 4 mints. I'm sorry that you have the best mints on this planet sir, but I will take as many as I please. If you don't like that then you can stop serving mints. But until that day comes I will be taking the amount of mints I see fit."}
{"text":"Love the playground for kids at this one.  For that reason alone - 5 stars.  I mean its a chick-fil-a and you know what kind of food they have, so nothing amazing, but always good service and good food.  The staff is always friendly and asking how they can help."}
{"text":"Another great chick-fil-a location. Good friendly service and normal to be expected food for this chain.  I love how friendly they always are and my kids love the playground area."}
{"text":"My favorite chick-fil-a. Probably because it's the one that's the closest.  Very normal and what you would expect from Chick-fil-a and everyone leaves happy.  These guys are pretty dang friendly too at this location...almost creepy .. hahah"}
{"text":"I am so dissatisfied with this location.  Today I was purchasing lunch for my team because we were running short staffed and wanted to provide lunch so they did not need to worry.  I placed my order on the app which was easy and efficient and made sure to do it prior to the lunch rush.  Everything went well up until I retuned to work and realized they forgot the Cobb salad I had ordered.  I returned back to the location and let them know the salad was missed.  There was no apology and I had to remind them of the salad dressing, and they still forgot the red pepper toppings!  The drive thru configuration also is a reason I strongly dislike this location because you can not efficiently get in and out without spending a lot of time waiting for people to move."}
{"text":"This is a very good store. I wish all other CF had the same high standards as this one. Staff was very courteous and smiling, service was quick and accurate and my Egg Sausage Cheese Biscuit tasted so good. The egg is like a fluffy cloud in the sky! And the sausage is not tough. Coffee is not bad at all. Very spacious and comfortable dining rooms. The free WiFi works very easily too."}
{"text":"Chick Fil A was a totally unknown world for me for a long time until recently when I tried the sandwich at a presentation seminar in Florida. Last night for my solo dinner in CLT, amongst many choices, I chose Chik Fil A Deluxe Sandwich with a small fries and a side salad. To enjoy my solo dinner in my hotel room even more, I stopped by at a gas station convenience store and bought a big can of Fosters beer. When I retuned to my hotel, there were freshly baked cookies at the front desk. Perfect. I can now have the full course dinner. With Foster's (750ml), side salad and the fries, the Chick Fil A Deluxe sandwich tasted like heaven. 

This Chick Fil A location had a very good and professional service too. The cashier lady (Keyonda?) was very courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"Just what Stephanie St needed, another fast food joint. No but really, I am happy to see that we got some Chick-fil-A 's in town.  I've driven past this place many many times to see cars wrapped around the drive thru. I knew I would go eventually one of these days - today was my day. It was the darkest, most gloomy and windy day ever and there were only two other cars in the drive thru. Jackpot. 

On to the food - their menu is limited, but in my opinion the best restaurants have small menus of perfection. 

Combo #1 - original chicken sandwich. Good, not greasy. Meal comes with waffles fries and a drink. I thought it was kinda lame, but lettuce, tomato and cheese is an extra $0.60.

Combo #2 - spicy chicken sandwich - has a nice kick to it, also not greasy. Comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles and cheese by default. I really like cheese on a chicken sandwich, so this did it for me. But to each their own. 

#4 - 4 piece chicken tenders - chicken taste was consistent to the others, but I did not feel that it was a good value at basically $1 a piece for some fairly small pieces of chicken. I think Cane's or Chicken Shack has this place beat as far as chicken tender value.  But it seems that tenders are just all around pricey everywhere.

All in all, I did enjoy the taste of all the food. I especially enjoyed the waffle fries that you could tell were fried in clean oil (just based on the color alone). Overall chicken flavor is great, overall $ value is a 4 star in my book.  Keep up the quality."}
{"text":"I love chick fil A and always get it from here. But today after I got off work later I went and got my meal from there. I drove 20 minutes home to find out my bun is hard on my sandwich..."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and where I'm from, there is no Chick-fil-A. So whenever there is an opportunity for it, I'll do it! 

The customer service is wonderfully refreshing, with most responses being \"my pleasure.\" It's like walking into a polite bubble which is sadly, shocking. Some people love it here, some dislike it, but the food is delicious.

I had four chicken fingers, waffle fries, soda, and their special sauce (a meal). FYI- They also have \"entrees\", but no yummy fries with those orders! 

Dinner was great! Hoping they come up to the 716 soon!"}
{"text":"Great place to go right before a flight. Service is unbelievably quick and workers are super nice."}
{"text":"Aside from the constantly good food most people go to Chick-fil-A because they are known for their outstanding customer service. Unfortunately the staff at this location apparently skipped Chick-fil-A customer service 101 orientation! Went there on a semi busy Friday afternoon and every single customer was waiting for their order. When we finally got our bags, they were handed to us with a \"Here you go\" no, \"My apology for the wait\" or the customary, \"It was my pleasure\" that we are all so used to hearing when we go to Chick-fil-A.  Not the kind of service I expect from this franchise. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"This location is okay. It's always super busy, but the staff is usually really nice and efficient, whether you're there during busy lunch hours or stopping in for a random bite while in the area shopping. There's really nothing to complain about...except that it's a greasy fast food joint, with greasy salt-laden food that makes me happy while I'm eating it, and immediately feel blah about 5 minutes later. Regardless, if I'm willing to put up with feeling awful after eating, this is one of the better Chick-Fil-A's to eat at.

Also, the new chocolate chip cookies at Chick-Fil-A are absurdly delicious. Seriously. Fast food places have no right making such delicious treats. Haha."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Chick-fil-A, go. If you go...go here! This location is a really nice, newer location with staff so friendly that it's almost creepy (of course, most locations are this way).

It's been a while since I've actually dined in at a Chick-fil-A, but the interior was on-trend with today's rustic/industrial vibe, and the \"take a giant plastic thing and we'll bring your food out to you\" approach was new to me, but did save the standing around. Which, apparently is the goal, since the front of the house is much smaller and clearly designed to move you on to your table, instead of having a bunch of hungry customers huddling around aimlessly waiting for their stuff, as I've always experienced at older locations.

Regardless, the space was spotless, they have an awesome outdoor area with plenty of bike racks and tables, and the service was excellent. A great option if you're in the mood for some fast food..."}
{"text":"There's really not much to say...it's Chick-Fil-A. If you've been to one, you've been to them all. The food is good while you're eating it, but always leaves me feeling absolutely miserable. Blame the grease, blame the excessive sodium. Whatever it is, I enter every meal at Chick-Fil-A knowing what the rest of my day is going to feel like afterwards...and it's not good. Of course, everyone's body reacts differently to different foods, so hopefully the same effect doesn't occur when you go.

If I skip past the post-meal misery, and focus on the during-meal enjoyment, it's not bad. The classic chicken sandwiches and nuggets are awesome. Add some of their polynesian sauce, and you're guaranteed to please your fast food-craving palate. While you're adding up the calories, just tack on my favorite thing at Chick-Fil-A: a milkshake! I love the vanilla milkshakes there. They're not the best ever, but they're good enough to satiate my gluttonous sweet tooth!

Now, if you're one of those people who seems to think that a fast food chain can be your one-stop shop for both unhealthy and healthy foods, Chick-Fil-A will disappoint you like every other fast food chain when it comes to their healthy selections. Their grilled chicken sandwich is simply gross. As if the bland taste doesn't disappoint, the soggy bun is always there to let you down. Their salads are okay, but naturally, it's pre-prepared, and the freshness, while decent for a fast food chain isn't going to hit the spot.

Finally, Chick-Fil-A isn't cheap. For fast food, there are definitely cheaper options that can leave you with the same greasy brick in your stomach, and I always kind of get annoyed when I see how much I end up spending on a meal there.

One bonus of this particular location, though, is that they send employees out to look for their customers eating in the mall's food court to offer the customers free refills. We were totally surprised and impressed from a customer service standpoint. Of course, customer service is almost always the competitive advantage of Chick-Fil-A...well, that and the waffles fries...and the two pickles on every sandwich."}
{"text":"This review reflects my recent fattyness.... I don't like it! But I do like Chick-fil-A!
One late night, my sweetheart and I decided to be happy (instead of skinny) and made our way to Chick-fil-A. On a late Tuesday night, this place was buzzing! After trying the food, I can see why.
I ordered a Deluxe sandwich with waffle fries and strawberry shake; my honey had nuggets, spicy sandwich, and waffle fries. Can I just say, I LOVE waffle fries! I didn't think it was going to be crispy when i saw it, because it looked so pale but thankfully they were. Phew! Soggy fries is a \"no bueno\". The sandwiches were great. I really enjoyed my deluxe - it comes with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and cheese. So yummy! Strawberry shake was good too, nothing fancy. Oh and chicken nuggets were great, crispy and juicy. I appreciate Chick-fil-A having a variety of sauces, I sampled all of them and enjoyed Ranch the most.
Even though the restaurant was busy, we ordered though the app on our way there and got out food within a couple of minutes at a pick up window. Great option since the drive though looked super busy!
I like the quality and ease of getting the food. There are options for the skinny-fat days too :) Those are the days when you lie to yourself and say that you'll be \"healthy\" but go to a fast food restaurant to get your meal... you know who you are ;)"}
{"text":"Only been to this location one time but the service was great! It was noon & packed out the door as well as a long line in the drive through. The cashier that took our order was extremely nice and cheerful. We received our order very quickly & I noticed there were workers walking around to clean up each table immediately after customers left. It was clean & seemed to have a great staff."}
{"text":"I absolutely love chick-fil-a! Many locations I go to have outstanding customer service. But this locations is horrible!! My husband,daughter & I dined here last night. When we got there it was pretty empty. As we begin to give the cashier our order, she immediately & rudely interrupted my husband asking  \"what we'd like to drink & if that was all?\" My husband finished giving our order & she rang us up. The amount didn't add up so he repeated our order & asked if she got everything. \"Yep\" she said. When they serve us our food we are missing one sandwich, checked the recipe to see she did not get the order right! He has to go back, wait in line to get what he originally ordered. Then I realized they had gave me the wrong sandwich as well, I asked for the spicy chicken deluxe. I received a plan chicken deluxe..I noticed there was a family that was there before us still waiting for their food as we were finishing. They looked frustrated. Also, there was trash on a few tables, high chairs were scattered & filthy! All while 2 workers were sitting laughing & eating."}
{"text":"Very dirty  restaurant not appealing to want to eat there especially the floor, also play area for children not used well as rule for 3 & under could play & there were approx 12 year olds screaming & playing roughly, many staff behind the counter with not much customer service & really many chatting but not working on serving the customers. Kudos to staff member Venice who was exceptional in cleaning tables & asking if we needed something else, very aware of the customers & we thank her being so attentive. The food was good & especially like your salads but the fact that there is not that friendly customer service & not clean, hope the standards could be higher to serve the customers."}
{"text":"Fairly fast service considering the line.  The police are not there anymore, but areas are still coned off, and they have individuals directing traffic.  They also have two drive through order lines where people walk to your car and take your order and then take your method of payment. Once you say your name to the first person everyone knows it down the line. 

This was my first time eating the food here, we go the spicy chicken sandwich, the nuggets, small fries, and chicken fingers.  The cost of all their food items were reasonable.  We also got one of each sauce, which was no extra charge.  They have a large selection of sauce, however most of them had weird after tastes to me, the only one I fully like was their chick fil a sauce.  The nuggets were very tiny compared to what I normally would expect, closer to the size of popcorn shrimp.  The chicken tenders were fine, but I prefer raising canes.  The spicy chicken sandwich was my favorite part, and something I would consider coming back for.  It had a great fry and seasoning on the chicken, and the ingredients tasted fresh.  Fries we're waffle shaped, and well...a normal tasting fry, nothing crazy exciting. Just a ok.  Overall for fast food at its price it is solid, and like I said amazing customer service, but definitely not something I would think would create such a frenzy that involves the intense lines it has continued to receive."}
{"text":"We were traveling through Arizona and stopped at this location. It was extremely clean, the staff was friendly and it was honestly the best sandwich I have had! Better than any other location I've been to."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I came to this location and the line was a mile long; they handled it so well, that I was through it, with food on hand, faster than it takes a Starbucks to make me a Frap! The service is always good and everyone seems to always be in a great mood here. I recommend the original chicken sandwich with extra pickles."}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order thru Door Dash.  It's been over 45 minutes and their site still says, \"We'll let you know when they start your order.\""}
{"text":"A rare fast-food \"five\" for Chick-fil-A, on account of their super-friendly staff, always-hot and crispy waffle fries, high-quality chicken in the form of their sandwiches, nuggets and salads, breaded and grilled options -- and especially the sauces! Pro-tip: Mix the buffalo, sriracha and Chick-fil-A sauce for a special treat that you know you deserve, then come back here and compliment me for that piece of life-changing advice."}
{"text":"I'm very shy and don't want to be friends with the people behind the drive-thru speaker. They always ask for my name. I don't really like that. It's not a huge deal, but I don't want my name announced out there: Hey Scott! your greasy fast food fried chickens' here! 

I tell them \"Elvis\". And everyone totally loses it. they tell me they don't believe me and act like A. it's the funniest damn thing they've ever heard and want to chat me up and joke about it, or B. it's totally scandalous and want to spit in something. Not an isolated incident. What if that were my real name? I know of at least 3 Elvises: Presley, Costello, and one of the chicken hawks from Looney Tunes, so it's not inconceivable.

Sandwiches are good and cheap. The bag that the sandwich comes in is more air-tight than most and if you don't open that up and eat quickly, your bun can get steamed soggy. So don't get it to drive home and eat 20 mins later."}
{"text":"Oh my word yes, Chick-fil-A still got it. I grew up 2 mles down the street and have been going here for at least the last decade. Chicken biscuits for breakfast, chicken ranch wraps for lunch, its all good here. From the looks of it, the seem to have installed a new waterfall in the drive through area, which is totally unnecessary. The chicken sandwich and nuggets are on point. Every piece of chicken I get from this location is always fresh and juicy. The high school outfit they have working the place is bright eyed and friendly and no one has 1) messed up my order or 2) broken out into a musical interlude, which were my two greatest concerns. Overall, an above average location for a spectacular chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Guess what!? Some tomfuckinfoolery apparently!!! I'm sitting here talking my friend out of near suicide because y'all decided to change the menu. Every single day I feed this little diaper filler a spicy chicken biscuit. Came in today and some pimple dick told me they didn't serve them anymore. Fix yourself! I don't want to have to scrape my buddy off the pavement over a spicy chicken biscuit! And tell the cutie with a booty to holla at a playa when you see me in the streets. One love. Frag out."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm leaving a 2star rating is if you are going to enforce no refills on specialty drinks, I understand that, but don't do it if there is no notification of that especially when your cashiers up sell the specialty drinks and don't let you know of the policy when every other drink in Chic-fil-a has free refills. I had to ask a manager to get a refill a Coke in the specialty cup and she wouldn't do it. She turned around to point out the policy and it wasn't visible at all \"it's in the store somewhere\" are her exact words. I'm not one to leave reviews like this at all but this was crazy. Me being born and raised in Atlanta, and having worked with Chic-fil-A on numerous corporate projects this doesn't seem right. Other than that, the food was great as always."}
{"text":"I don't really get all the hype over this place.I do like that their chicken is real. I only go here because my little toddler buddy pretty much only eats ketchup with a side of french fries and chicken nuggets. Other then that, I think their items are very salty. The staff here is great and efficient. I was here during the lunch rush and the place was very clean and well stocked in the condiments zone."}
{"text":"I've received bad service at this location numerous times before but since it's CFA I always give them a pass. But yesterday I took a 15 minute break, it took over 15 minutes to get my food but my manager allowed me to eat but I only ate the fry. And today this morning, I chose to eat my sandwich and it was dry crust and nasty when I bit into it. I called the store and the manager said that's what happens when sandwiches sit over night but clearly they don't pay attention to their own product because I'm a faithful CFA customer literally and I NEVER eat my sandwiches hot, it's not a thing for me so I know what one looks and tastes like yet they still didn't want to replace it. 
If they had proper customer service here & had their lines moving fast & efficiently I would've had time to SEE my sandwich and KNOW it was garbage but all I got to eat was the fries (which were good!). But the disgusting sandwich was a problem on their end. Don't waste your time here they have poor management and preparation. Easily a 2/10. If you want GOOD quality food go to Gustos or a CFA outside of the mall near Cotswold they have great service! 
UPDATE 6/25: once again, I went to get just a fries. Fries well done. I ordered at 2:50 asked if they were ready @ 2:56 because well done only need a extra few sec. he said they take a while. I get my food get all the way to my job and they are burnt and hard I couldn't even chew them. Well done is a little crispy not over cooked. I just went back to receive a refund and the manager proceed to say: That's what you asked for, \"I can give you one this time but next time I can't take food back.\" They act like they're managing a McDonalds CFA service is never this terrible. I won't be going back they are too unprofessional and not for the customer at all. He expected me to eat over cooked food yet the associate who checked the bag even said they were hard and wouldn't break and if the did they were crumbling. It's a mess here. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I went through drive during a rush, and Matthew was so so nice! I work in the drive thru at Culvers, and I know what it's like to be in a rush! It's hard to stay calm at times, but he was so respectful, kind, and just awesome. My sandwich was delicious and I'll for sure be back! Good job :-))))"}
{"text":"Rolled up in here on a hot labor day and the lines were long. But they moved quickly and you can order through an employee with an iPad while you're in line, which makes the experience move really quickly. What set the experience apart? 

As we sat outside finishing our meal, a manager walked up and asked us how the meal went. He then asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks and if we needed anything else! So nice to see you can still get top notch service from a fast food restaurant! Oh, and waffle fries. Cause they're AMAZING. Thanks to Don the manager for being so nice to us!"}
{"text":"Came here early in the morning for breakfast and as soon as we walked in so did another family. There was only one cashier who immediately called to the back saying there was a large group coming in and at that moment two other employees came out from the back to open three registers. Now that's customer service! 

I wanted to give 5 stars but the only reason I didn't is because under the booth next to us was a big sticky spot on the floor, like a soda was spilled and not cleaned up. Maybe no one told them but this bothered me because it was super early, like we were the first customers and it was an old spill. So this means that they did not do the cleaning procedures properly the night before and mopped under the tables."}
{"text":"I don't know why this Chic-Fil-A is so bad. For breakfast, the chicken biscuit is hard and always feels stale. For dinner, they consistently get our order wrong. We go out of our way now to the Gilbert and 202 Chic-fil-A because everything is better there. The management at San Tan should find out how the Gilbert Rd location can get it right."}
{"text":"I got dragged here by a friend a while back. I hadn't eaten Chick-fil-A since it was on my college campus years ago, but I went along anyway. UGH. I guess this constitutes as \"good\" food if you grew up in a trailer, but otherwise...pass. 1) The chicken always has a weird strip on the end that makes me wonder what exactly it is. It's chewy and disgusting and I remember cutting it off every time I ate CFA in Flagstaff. 2) In true trailer park fashion, everyone has their dirty, loud, screaming children with them and let them run wild, usually barefoot or with a dirty diaper sagging two inches from the floor. I'd rather not eat than eat somewhere like this again."}
{"text":"Love Chick-fil-a, but if they do not improve the time and quality of their new menu, I will have a very different review. Please get it together soon!  I need to love you guys!"}
{"text":"Great service and people. We come at least 3-4 times a month and the service is always first class. Never have a complaint about the food either. And we have the app and they often send us free items. Wonderful place."}
{"text":"I've had Chick-Fil-A in many different areas. The main thing I love is the consistency of the food. It's always fresh, hot and delicious. I have always enjoyed going to Chick-Fil-A because they give you as many sauces as you would like, people come around and ask how you're doing and if you would like a refill on your beverage. I rarely get mistakes on my order. This pains me to say it but this Chick-Fil-A isn't up to par with the other Chick-Fil-A restaurants I've been to. My order was wrong, I wasn't given my drink order correctly, when I asked for sauces the employee didn't give me what I asked and literally counted the sauces she had already given me and acted like McDonalds. I didn't get the usual \"my pleasure\" attitude from here either. I have always gotten the sweetest employees at Chick-Fil-A's except for this one. It was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Started to get hungry from a long trip and decided to pull over. Amazing service - all the employees were friendly and the food was hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Three problems on my last two visits 
1) No one wants to hear the Manager say....why does something happen every time I open. 
2) I asked for a bacon egg and cheese muffin and got the biscuit
3) I asked for three light mayo and the drive thru guy says.... there are two in there.... is this NEW MATH?
I mean you put them out for self service. If I wanted I could go in and stock for a year. 
Jeez.... why does something happen when I come to Chik-Fil-A ?
One star.... MY PLEASURE."}
{"text":"Like all of the other Chick-fil-A fans I'm thrilled that I finally have one close to home. Before we would seek them out while traveling in other states. 

This location was well prepared for their popularity and has the system down for ordering and getting food to customers. So far I've visited twice and have gone inside both times. Each time I ordered and was on my way with food in less than five minutes. 

The food and service here are both great and definitely in line with the chain standards. The Spicy Deluxe Chicken Sandwich is my favorite and has never disappointed me. The waffle fries and sweet tea are delicious too."}
{"text":"I love chick fil a! Their food is so good! Fries, chicken salad, chicken soup, chicken tenders, all great!! I especially love their Polynesian sauce. It's the best thing ever."}
{"text":"I drive a little farther to eat at this location because I always thought it taste the best. But boy today they were really off.  The person that took my order seemed that it was his first day or he was just unbothered because he got my entire order wrong. Then when they finally corrected it my fries were cold and my drink size was wrong that I upgraded to . I have never had bad service or food from this location so I hope it was just a bad day . All my food tasted old that I did not even eat it ."}
{"text":"Drove 25 min for dinner and thru decided to block that drive thru with a white truck so no more customer  can order. Not sure if it because of the free chicken sandwich but I wanted the pay don't advertise  something that you can not handle."}
{"text":"I'm always amazed of how pleasant and cordial the staff is at the University Chick-fil-A. They genuinely seem happy and it creates a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. Rarely do you find flavored coffee creamer at a fast food restaurant. These small additives promote a great start to a day. 

My experience at this location is by far the reason I come back time and time again. There is nothing like walking through the door and see many smiles and greetings upon my arrival. They really go above and beyond for customers. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Okay Lisa that works at this Strongsville location is the SWEETEST most wonderful lady l have ever met. l live in Lorain but would drive here for her service. Amazing."}
{"text":"Great place to come and eat take the kids and family. Food is delicious as always. Customer service is pretty good. Interesting tidbit about this location is that they have games available such as boardgames that you can play while you're there. Only thing I didn't like about my experience was that the sandwiches were not toasty roasty hot and fresh. It appeared that they had been sitting there for a while which is probably why they were so fast getting the sandwiches out to me.  Nobody likes to eat a cold chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. It seems that every Chic-Fil-A has great service. The employees are very helpful, polite, and seem to actually care about customers. The food is fresh and taste fantastic. If only they could offer onions!"}
{"text":"As I'm inching forward to give my order, the girl standing outside that takes orders stepped in front of my car without warning, causing me to slam on my brakes. So that was an interesting start. I got the chicken fingers with fries meal. The waffle fries seemed under cooked and were tasteless. The chicken fingers were pretty good. I love their variety of sauces. It seems they finally got their line issue under control as I was in and out in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"The drive-thru extended to Stephanie. As much as I wanted the convenience of staying in my car, the thought of saving some gas and the potential to save a few minutes appealed more. I walked in, and the line may have had only 3 or 4 parties ahead of me. I ordered while in the line, and received my food maybe 5 minutes later.

My grilled chicken sandwich was of quality rivaling those of 2-3 times the price. Tender, well-seasoned chicken breast atop leaves of crunchy lettuce and a fresh slice of tomato. The slightly sweet grain bun and a tangy BBQ spread sealed the deal. I also ordered a frosted coffee. A chilly, pleasant surprise. It wasn't overly sweet, and had a perfect ratio of coffee and milk. A definite must for times when you could use an ice cream fix, but want to save 400-500 calories.

This restaurant was well-staffed, with almost all hands on deck. Their process simply did not stop. The employees were cheerful and well-mannered. I appreciated their level of professionalism. I hope they're able to maintain their service and quality. It's something so easily lost. As for the experience, based on this one alone, I won't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience. Love the way they always seem happy and speak to you with respect and a smile."}
{"text":"Lunch time is very hectic at this location. (Lunch hour at any Chick-Fil-A overall is very busy) 

The order system is when it's busy, keeps the line moving. Although I wished the parking lot layout is different so traffic flow would be easier during busy hours. 

Employees are very courteous and always gets our large orders on point. (Orders over $40) 

The Superfood salad is my favorite! It consist of kale, broccolini, dried cherries, glazed pecans, roasted almond and drizzled with maple vinaigrette. :) This is the location where I first tried the side salad."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at this Chick-fil-A today.... Bought chicken noodle soup from drive thru, and when I got home... there were no noodles in the soup... it was just watery with some bits of chicken in it.... how is that even possible??? I know its not always like this because I get this all the time!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place 2 times over a weekend of being in town for a holiday party.    The first time went well and everyone loved the large takeout order we brought back to their house.

The 2nd time we went there to pick up a really large catering tray for the party - the party go-ers loved the chicken as normal - the pick up process just wasn't as smooth as you would expect, especially spending as much as we did.   The guy who was running the show wasn't the most friendly person to interact with but got the job done."}
{"text":"This place is the best came in with the hubby went in line to start ordering. The cashier was a sweet old lady took our order, fast and efficient and gave us a marker to let one of there employees know which order is ours. While waiting for our food was pretty busy but not that much until it hits lunch time then the place gets pretty crazy. But we got our food it was cooked well and was hot and delicious. But once we were done another employee was so sweet she offered us mints. The employees here are pretty awesome & don't mind coming back! I give this place 5 stars and hope they keep doing great will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have never known Chick-fil-A to have such a slow drive-thru. This location has got to be the slowest in the state of Arizona. The service is okay, but it gets frustrating when you're sitting in line for 10-15 minutes. This is not McDonald's this is Chick-fil-A, get it together."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I have grown up in Avondale and remember when this location opened. A wait for food was like a non-existent thing. Everything was always right and so hot and fresh. Now the wait is long and inconvenient, the food is warm, not hot, and the customer service has declined tremendously. 

I order the same thing every visit because I'm pregnant and I have cravings LoL. It's a Chicken egg and cheese biscuit with extra cheese. It has never been prepared correct on the first try. NEVER, EVER! I always have to go back inside or back through the drive-thru to have it fixed. Occasionally they will offer me something free on my next visit, but I don't want that, I want my food prepared the way I specifically asked. 

I love Chik-fil-A's food, it is great, but who wants to keep paying for inconvenience and inconsistency? Not I."}
{"text":"There is absolutely NO WAY this is the fastest Chik-fil-A drive thru in Arizona. Take that sign down because you are false advertising. I was stuck in this drive thru for 20 min and it wasn't even the lunch rush.

Great food and great customer service but bruh the wait time are killing me!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast.  Chick-fil-A truly scratches an itch.  I think they fry everything in peanut-oil?

Regardless you need to get breakfast here.  CHIKN MINIS!!!!!!  

Some day I'll finally talk myself into getting a party tray of nuggets just for me."}
{"text":"I refer to this location as a faux Chick-fil-A because they do not meet the standards set by the others, with a few employees as exceptions. Service is where this particular Chick-fil-A seems to fall short. You are not greeted upon arrival or given their typical my pleasure when you say thank you. I ordered a number 1 with no pickles and had the table marker thing shoved in my hand. When I asked for Chick-fil-A sauce the employee seemed annoyed but fulfilled the request. While I was waiting, a man approached the counter and said he ordered a frozen lemonade not a regular one and the employees looked confused and demanded to know who took his order. He said she wasn't up front anymore and the employees exchanged glances and words in Spanish amongst themselves then finally said they would take care of it for him. Not your typical Chick-fil-A response. My food came out pretty quickly despite how busy they were and I was pleased with how hot my fries were. Sadly, they forgot to give me a sandwich without pickles and oddly the bun was cold. Not like room temperature because I don't really need my bun to be warm, it was actually cold. My lemonade was as tart as the employees and I wish this location could get it together."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Chik Fil A I have ever been to. I occasionally visit late after work through the drive thru and the employees are always so nice and really live their job!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Drive thru gets a bit long during lunch hours but it goes really fast !"}
{"text":"Ugh the line at this location is always ridiculously long. I downloaded the app so I could skip the line and place my order. However I think others in line are also doing the same so the app takes forever. Last time I waited in line I got to the cashier before I could place the order on the app. One time I had a coupon and waited in line forever to find out that the coupon wasn't valid at that location. Nowhere on the coupon did it say that. Food is what you would expect at any Chick Fila but the rating is merely for the consistently long lines during breakfast and lunch and customer service. Tip: go to any other Chick Fila location during breakfast and lunch on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Is there a Chick-fil-A that isn't busy?  This one is no exception. I've only found 1 Chick-fil-A where the service was not too-notch but that's a different review. This location is good, just crowded."}
{"text":"I go to this location all the time and it's always great! I'm just a little bummed this morning because I ordered a chicken biscuit for breakfast and got home and opened it to find something I didn't even know was on the menu after looking it up it looks like it's the egg white grill. I was so excited for my chicken biscuit! I even went in and ordered. So 3 stars today because I got the wrong order and didn't want to drive all the way back to correct it especially since breakfast wasn't being served anymore."}
{"text":"Honestly this Chick-Fil-A location is just bad. Unfortunately it's the closest one to my house, so I come here a lot, but I always seem to have something wrong with my order - something added, something left out, condiments forgotten, etc. The team is all very young and they don't seem to take employee training seriously, seeing as how none of the employees seem to know how to work their registers smoothly. They are also consistently very slow-moving in the drive-thru. I sat in line for a total of 15 minutes once last week, and then they got my order wrong. I hate leaving bad reviews but this location is consistently low-grade."}
{"text":"I was happy to see this in the Calgary airport. It is currently a bit under $10 for a combo with a sandwich, fries and a drink. Probably costs a bit more than normal because it's in an airport, but I dunno. Contrary to other reviews here I thought the food and service were decent, and the restaurant looked extremely clean. Mind you, it wasn't very busy when I stopped in. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"They just opened so loong lines. But moves pretty fast. About 15 cars in front of me, and I was through in less than 10 minutes. Food is awesome. I grew up with Chick-fil-A in Texas."}
{"text":"zayah: is mr wall there ?
chick-fil-a: no? 
z: is mrs wall there? 
c: no? 
z: is henry wall there? 
c:no? 
z: is there all walls there? 
c:no? 
z: well than what is holding up your roof? 

okay this was funny but to call my son back 20 times just to find out who he is? like seriously chick-fil-a don't you have customers in your drive thru or in your dining area you have to take care of?????! to call my son 20 times then to have your manager call over one phone prank call ?  then take the time to try to explain? then call me again.....i mean like seriously that is harassment ... is that really necessary for one prank call? how do you get that time?"}
{"text":"Chick Fil A is always a favorite.. But I am especially fond of this location. I took our son there a while back - he has Autism and started to have a pretty bad meltdown. The staff was super helpful - they offered and helped carry our food and drinks out to the care. It was a small and simple thing but it meant a lot to me at the time and something I won't ever forget. Plussss I LOVE the food!"}
{"text":"I have been here plenty and normally the food is good. They have a play place for the kids to play in. They have plenty of seating as well. They deliver the food to your table, and the service is fast. The people working here are friendly and nice. They have a decent dessert selection. This time, I will have to say was kind of disappointing. I got a kids meal for my kid and the nugget where tiny compared to before. It seems like the chicken sandwich got smaller as well. Our fries were cold and they did not taste good. I hate when places raise there prices and make the food smaller.  With that being said, I will be back because my kid loves it here because of the play place."}
{"text":"I am not sure with what's wrong with this particular location, but the last 3 trips here, being dining in or the drive thru our order was wrong!

What's so difficult with getting a \"protein style\" wrong? Club is missing bacon or cheese or twice missing both? Twice dining in we had to let the manager know, once we got all the way home and found it missing bacon?!!

Last night went in the drive thru and had a feeling to check and the one \"protein style club\", yup we guessed it, missing both cheese and bacon! Had to get out of my car and go to the window and asked for a manager and got James. Waited again with no excuse to give, and after letting him know this was at least the 3rd time this happened at this location, and all I got was \"I apologize for that\".

I was told Jessie was the store manager and want to let him know, this is by far the least inconsistent Chic Fil a we've been to and just get your employees to value their job a little more.

You just don't feel the same as going to other Chic Fil a restaurants, this one feels more like any other Wendy's or McDonald's with the service and not so clean dining area and restroom. 

The 2 stars are for the food and convenience!"}
{"text":"Had a rather unpleasant experience with the service and food at this location. Usually Chick Fil A has good service and fresh food, but this location was lacking of those. 

Yes, they were busy but there is no reason for a cashier to give an attitude to a customer. After I asked politely to change my drink order, the female cashier shouldn't have rolled her eyes. I guess service in Phoenix is going down....

Lastly, fries weren't fresh or warm. Big disappointment. This location lost our business!"}
{"text":"Hello, this is your self professed Chick-fil-A *ADDICT* speaking :) 

I have been hooked on the stuff since I was a teen. Back then, we'd walk past the only one that was near us, in the Paradise Valley Mall, and we'd happily gobble up nuggets from the tray of \"free samples\" outside. We were broke stoner kids yet none of the employees ever hassled us. Very cool. 

It's been 18 years and I'm still as in love with it (no, probably MORE!). Biggest difference is that I'm no longer a malcontent & I have money to pay for my nuggets :) LOL! Oh the other big difference though... I no longer live in Arizona where Chick-fil-A's are a dime a dozen! And so, I must drive long distances to get my treats. As this is the case though, I have been to many CFA locations all over both California & Arizona. They are typically always nice establishments, well taken care of full of good employees. This location in Peoria however, is extra special somehow. One of the main reasons I believe? Leo. 

Leo Lichter is the owner of this location (and I believe the Metro one also?) He's a friendly face who I always saw busting his tail behind the counter in MetroCenter and when I come to this store I still see him doing it here, years later, even though his employees are close at hand already doing the same thing. I have never seen this man without a smile or kind greeting. He TRULY cares about his store, his employees and his patrons. You can just TELL. 

The quality of food here is better because of all this, even though CFA never sucks. As the first poster said, there is always someone coming to your table offering to refill your drink... the fruit cups are always fresh & tasty, the sweet tea never TOO sweet nor too watered down. 

Yes, I always come to this location several times during my trip when I'm back in town visiting the folks. And I always look forward to seeing Leo & his crew of very polite friendly employees, knowing I am eating good food in a clean well cared for environment :)

Oh I almost forgot... in case you didn't know Chick-fil-A is ALWAYS closed on Sundays. It's a rule instituted by Truett Cathy, the man who started the business. This is just another thing I love about the place. Staying true to who you are & adhering to your religious beliefs. God Bless it! :)"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience at this location. Was given wrong order at the drive through. When we got home we realized it. Called the restaurant and they wouldn't acknowledge their mistake. Asked to speak to manager and they wouldn't connect us. STAY AWAY FEOM THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"Ice cream very sandy; not soft, smooth texture. Chicken sandwich ok. Will not return."}
{"text":"Waited for over 25 minutes in through to get a chicken sandwich. This is absolutely ridiculous. Not the first time this has occurred at this location. Will never come to this location again!!"}
{"text":"Just had a really cool post to share! Today I was sort of upset I went to my drs office to get blood work done and some medicine for my throat and being sick. They no longer take my insurance after a long drive there. Upset to say in the least. Finally a dr that was able to help me.. but anyway, on the way I wanted to stop at Chick-fil-A for their nuggets. Something told me to go inside instead of the drive thru. Not to eat, just to order. So we go inside I ordered and mentioned we never had their breakfast. So after our order I get my debit card to pay, and the manager said no, it's ok. I was like huh? She said it's ok, it's on me. You've never had our breakfast. I looked at her shocked. I was like are you serious? She said yes. I was so surprised. I've been having such a shitty past few days and that simple gesture just blew my mind. She didn't know what a hard time I've been having, but that right there just gave me some hope. Giving this place a 5 star. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is amazing thats it nothing its too good. Second of all, some of yall need to stop complaininh i swear some of yall are complaining how the the chicken is not freakn \"thick\" enough, like calm down nothing in the world is perfect especially when chick fil a is one of the most popular places. Also, people treat the employees polite, like yes, they are the employee and they have to treat the customer with respect, but really these people work so much and have to deal with a lot of people, like they aint machines!!!! But yes this is one of the best places and dont be dramatic is just delicious food"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chick Fil A in the Charlotte area.   No matter what time of day I go in, the staff are always super (and I mean like crazy, super, wtf nice).  Food is always hot and ready quick.   I would suggest not going right at 12:00pm for the lunch rush cause it gets super packed.

The kids that work at this store must be the pride and joy of their parents.   To be honest, it almost scares me how nice they are.    I am not going to lie, I have driven off a couple of times with an eerie pit in my stomach after a SUPER DUPER FRIENDLY interaction......\"thank you sir it was a pleasure to serve you this morning, I hope you have a great day\".........EEEK!"}
{"text":"Ended up down here the other night... Rivergate is a pretty new shopping center with round-abouts galore.  This location is very clean and the people working here are pretty friendly.

The unique thing I saw with this location was a floating \"island\" where all the ketchup, napkins, straws, and anything else you need (minus the sauces) reside.  There is a fairly large dinging room with fresh flowers (the happened to be daffodils) on each table that is well maintained."}
{"text":"The nice thing with Chick-fil-a is that you know what you are getting yourself into when you go.  Most locations are pretty consistent when food (as any other fast food chain place) but I find that this chain does really well with customer service - they may have changed their training and operations procedures to include the phrase:  \"my pleasure\" but I can see that getting old pretty quick.  Luckily I don't go here too often for that to happen.

Some Chick-fil-a locations bring out your food to you with a number system which is nice, but then I feel obligated to tip since they are going above and beyond from behind the counter.

Anyways, back to this location... it's convenient to Matthews.... sometimes Independence traffic doesn't really help this location out with wanting to go but it's a solid 3 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Staff here is great... I think that makes it so much better for dining experiences.  I haven't run into any of the managers yet... 

I'm so used to the old sckool you get the food at the counter and bring it to your table, I'm still a little uncomfortable with them bringing it to us... they still manage to do it with a long line, which makes it that much nicer... but I could go either way.

This location is near my office so... I try to go for breakfast and a late lunch.... it gets super busy right around lunch time so I just avoid the rush."}
{"text":"The chicken nuggets are fantastic! I really recommend the chick-fil-a sauce, it's one of the bests! It's always very busy which means it's good!!! I would go there everyday if i could but i don't have car. I really love there Audi Parking so i can see the car!!!!!!! MUCH LOVE TO EVERYONE THAT EATS AND WORKS AT CHICK-FIL-A!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible - my chicken sandwich was not fully cooked & the coleslaw had no flavor, it was so old we couldn't get the lid off, it was stuck & was not dated as most of them are. The girl behind the counter was too busy flirting with a man and letting his kids run around behind the counter servings themselves ice cream.  We will never again visit this location.  

Horrible food and service"}
{"text":"GOOD food. I will be back! I was in and out in 15 min. Salads are FRESH, Chicken piping hot and crisp. WAY better then KFC"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A has always had a special place in my heart, and when I heard they were opening one in Vegas, my heart skipped a beat from excitement. My husband and I came to the grand opening tonight, and we ended waiting in line for about 20 minutes. After placing our order, we got our food immediately. The food was as good as it always is. The waffle fries were crispy, and my chicken sandwich was really moist. The entire staff is also really friendly and accommodating. I will be back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Chick fil-la has a special place in my heart. I have always thought that Chick fil la is only around the southeast, but a couple months ago while I was in downtown Chicago, I saw a chick fil la there, and I seriously was jumping with joy! I literally thought I can relocate to Chicago without any nostalgia now that I've found a chick fil-la there haha ;P

After I have been out of state for a while, I always crave chick fil la, this is often the location I go to. In fact, as I am writing this review, I am sipping my chick fil la milkshake. I recommend the small size, unless if you only want a milkshake for lunch. Even their small is plenty. I highly recommend their peppermint milkshake, which is only available over the Christmas holidays...bummer...I hope some day they will make it year round, or make some kind of chocolate chip mint..yum

Chick fil la is literally the best when it comes to fast food burger and fries places. They are always clean, aesthetically pleasing, well-maintained and has exceptional customer service. May I say hospitality mints? They bring your food out to your table, tell me a fast food chain that does that! There will always be fresh flower on your table, please, we all know how lame fake plastic flowers are...
You will not find an employee who looks bored and has an attitude here, everyone is extremely friendly, chick fil la is big on the family motto. 

As for this particular location, parking is a hassle, there is simply not enough...If you don't mind walking a bit you can definitely find more parking outside of qdoba, which wich, smoothie king and such. The drive through line is usually long, so long it sometimes blocks the right turn for people coming in from E Woodland dr. If you are coming up from E Woodlawn, you cannot make a left turn...Yup, have struggled with this for years. After your meal here why not check out park road shopping center, it's a historic shopping district in the area."}
{"text":"Iv never actually eaten here before, but always here nothing but positive story's about the food. I was in the area and was looking for a place to eat, why not here. The drive thru was consistent and when I walked inside it was clean and the employees were happy to take my order. I got the Cobb salad with extra chicken and a large drink. As I went to sit outside just moments later they brought my food to me. Witch I was shocked because that was pretty fast. All in all, I will be back, food was fresh and drink was refreshing."}
{"text":"My first official visit to Chick-fil-A!!

I visited the newest location with a loyal Chick-fil-A veteran one afternoon after hiking at Red Rock. We were starving and decided to check out this location since it was on our way getting back into town. 

The drive through line looked horrendously long so we decided to park and go eat inside. The wait was out the door but moved surprisingly quick. I do have to say I was very impressed with Chick-fil-A's staffing (I couldn't even count the number of employees working - they were everywhere and all grinning from ear to ear) and they really ensured a smooth flow of traffic. We ordered while in line with an employee holding a tablet and was at the register paying in less than 10 minutes. 

My friend said we HAD to get the:
- Spicy Deluxe Sandwich with Pepper-Jack cheese 
- Waffle Fries 
- Polynesian sauce (really stressed on this)
- Sweet Tea and Lemonade

...It was a tasty chicken sandwich. I think with all the hype and excitement of this fast food chain coming to Las Vegas I was expecting THE ULTIMATE chicken that tasted like no other fried chicken has tasted before. I can't say that I was floored or blown away by my meal (waffle fries were pretty bomb though) but it was definitely a yummy chicken sandwich I would eat again! 

I really enjoyed Chick-fil-A! The location on Eastern is more convenient for me but still seems to be extremely busy every time I drive by. Hopefully I can return when it's less chaotic. I look forward to trying their chicken nuggets or strips next time with a different sauce!"}
{"text":"The food is always good but this location has some very unpleasant servers - particularly at the drive-thru window. I finally went inside and that was slightly better."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever, so they close at 10 I got in the drive thru at 9:55 and they wouldn't answer the drive thru so I went inside and they said they were closed at 9:56 I use to work at CFA as a team lead and when we say we close at 10 we close at 10 not 5 minutes before, sorry you don't wanna fire up the grill. I think that is so crapy especially since I use to work at CFA and we never treated our guests like that."}
{"text":"Don't bother. 
I cannot see the appeal of this food. I ordered the chick a fill chicken sandwich. Plain and tasteless. Just a plain breaded chicken filet on a bun, no toppings. Burger King makes a tastier sandwich with fresh lettuce and tomato. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, delicious! 

As fast food chains go, this is probably my favorite. The staff is always nice and efficient; the food is pretty good. They also give you unlimited sauces and their sauces are top notch!"}
{"text":"Seriously your entrance is before the store with no signs, no other way to get in to the lot?!?!  Damn you evil Chick-fil-A gods...I can only assume you hate me. Also I wanted to see if I was the first person ever to get Chick-fil-A a single star rating. Seriously though I made the trek back around the block and this is possibly the most confusing parking lot ever."}
{"text":"I would go to this chick fil a often everyone is friendly. But yesterday I ordered breakfast and it gave me food poisoning and I was throwing up half my shift at work. I got sent home and I lost money. I won't be back to chick fil a."}
{"text":"I was so starving after running around grocery shopping today that I had to get a quick bite to eat at the first place I saw. Chick-fil-a was it. My friend was with me so we decided to go through the drive thru because her kids were getting tired. The second we pulled up we saw an employee standing in the shade waiting to take orders and she looked miserable. It is pretty hot today and there was no line so I was perplexed my the fact she was outside. Maybe I missed a busy rush? I don't know. Once we pulled up she greeted us and asked if we needed to see a menu. She didn't smile, just kinda waited and again looked so miserable. Not sure if she was having a bad day or because it was too hot for her, but I'd definitely have put someone out there that would be a better greeter. It was a big turn off. We quickly ordered and paid. We had our food within five minutes. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich (or #5), fries and lemonade. The lemonade was pretty tart and I had to add some water to it. The sandwich was really good. Food wise was great, customer service not so much. Hope she has a better day."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the only Chick-fil-A nearby and the worst one I've been to. Customer service is nowhere near what Chick-fil-A is known for. Food is subpar."}
{"text":"Their cookies used to be so soft and delicious and now they are burnt and hard and I hate them. I've asked them many times to fix this and they haven't. I am very disappointed. The fries are still bomb though"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic as always. The service is as good as a high end restaurant. They have hands-down the best service in all of the fast food industry. Anyone leaving a negative review is either stupid or a liar."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Just a typical fast food place that focuses on chicken.  I suppose if I was pulling off the interstate in the middle of nowhere and had to choose between a McDonalds, a Burger King, an Arby's, and a Chick-fil-A I'd probably choose the Chick-fil-A, but otherwise I'm not sure why I'd come here again."}
{"text":"It's good but overhyped.  I like the chicken but wish they'd cook the waffle fries a little bit more."}
{"text":"So after months of its grand opening, I decided to finally try it out and see what all the fuss was all about.  There was still a line in drive thru, I went there at 2:30 in the afternoon.  A really nice lady came up to my window and asked what my order will be.  Since I'm quite new to this place, I asked what she would recommend, and she said the classic #1.  And so that was what I ordered.  When I finally got my order.  I immediately dig into the fries.  They weren't sliced like the usual spear looking, but rather a waffle styled fries.  Genius I say.  Then came the most awaited chicken burger.  I added a pack of mayo and their famous Chik-fil-a sauce.  As I bit into the chicken burger, the sweetness of the sauce mixed with the mayo and the tenderness and juiciness of the chicken gave my palate something worth going back to.  The bun was soft and warm.  I will definitely return again and again.  The only thing I wished they'd done is to put the mayo and sauce in the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A! 

I've been to this location many times and I always recieved great customer service! 

The reason for my 4 stars review because there were times when my waffle fries are cold and not fresh. And times when I ordered 3-4 items off the menu and ask for amount of sauces but only got a total of 4/7 of them."}
{"text":"Every time you write a review for a fast food joint, a puppy gets killed. :(

Bad Yelper. BAD!

It's no secret: I dig Chik Fil A. 

It's a rare treat, but this lady can get rocked with an Original Chicken Sandwich and some of those famous Waffle Fries! 

Haven't deviated much from what I initially tried during the year my family spent living in Woodstock, GA.

Was pretty pumped to see this location open up near work!

The service is always over the top friendly (\"My pleasure!\") and efficient, whether you dine-in, carry-out, or drive-thru it. 

Their chicken seems less mystery-meat esque than most fast food joints.

*looks at ingredients list* *Dimethylpolysiloxane, \"an anti foaming agent\", what is that?!*

Haha ok, let's stop lying to ourselves, it likely still is. 

But there's certainly a noticeable difference in quality. 

Plus, the peanut oil everything gets fried in just plain tastes better.  

CFA gets points for all their awesome contributions to local communities. 

Don't forget to fill out the survey on your receipt to get a code for a free Original Chicken Sandwich on your next visit. 

Bock, boooocccccckkkkkk!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chick-fil-A I have ever been too. They left part of my lunch order out of my bag. I get back to work and notice I have no Sandwich. I call them back and the \"manager\" there said I could come back. At this point I'm at work and my lunch is ruined. They should have brought me the sandwich 8 mins away. I told them I was joy satisfied with making me come back for their error. Instead she wanted to make jokes or talk about how thy couldn't fix their mistake. I will not be visiting this Chick-fil-A again until their service is fixed. 

Very Disappointed and Hungry.

One year ago, never went back.  The one by my house in Charlotte is awesome. Great service every time. Maybe this store needs to go there to train."}
{"text":"I usually get a craving for Chick-Fil-A on Sundays.  Which is actually a good thing, because then I just have to move on to the healthier choices of eating

This location is usually, quick & fairly friendly.  As with any fast food setup, once the drive-thru backs up, parking & getting out of parking spaces can become an exercise in patience.

One of my favorite things at Chick-Fil-A is a morning of indulgence...  Chicken, Egg & Cheese Biscuit & a Large, Sweet Iced Tea.  Southern heaven."}
{"text":"I absolutely cherish the fact that no matter which location I go to, customer service is of the utmost importance. You can tell the culture at Chick-fil-A is focused on an upbeat, optimistic atmosphere and very sociable and friendly staff. Everyone seems happy to be here and they are enthusiastic and genuine to the fullest degree. 

Love how it's pretty healthy for fast food and gives great options for someone that's looking to \"keep it clean\" and is on the go."}
{"text":"Kids playground is great for my daughter. I usually have the number 3 (spicy chicken) combo."}
{"text":"Have to give this Chick Fil A credit for livliness.  Large Birthday party tonight with lots of balloons everywhere.  Lots of friendly employees.  I was surprised at all the customers after 8PM and they had lots of workers to handle the crowd.  Tuesday nights they have free sundaes for kids.  They also have a promotion that if you like them on facebook and wear a $5 Chick Fil A tee shirt they will have monthly giveaways.  

Food was good (as always), large portion of fries, fresh and hot unlike other fast food restaurants.  I disagree with Carrie's comments from late 2011.  Bathroom was very clean tonight; well I saw someone clean it.  Restaurant was very clean and they had 20 little ones tongiht.  I'm sure if you go during a crowded time it might not be perfect.  

I would be shocked to find a Chick Fil A anywhere that regularly performed poorly.  Corporate would never allow it."}
{"text":"We came from the Pacific NW and wanted to find out what all the fuss was about. At first bite the chicken is crunchy with a saltiness that is some how familiar. The pickles where crisp but slick enough to help the meat slide down my throat. I was disappointed in the lack of special sauce to wash it all down with.  All and all it was a fabulous oral experience, all though the decor inside the place was a bit drab and in serious need of a good interior decorator."}
{"text":"Service is great and puts a smile on your face at this location. They got me warm water and I ordered a wrap to try for the first time here. It was good and fresh :) will eat here again."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich, but this location's new menu style is highly inefficient. DO NOT go here."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I am giving a fast food place 5 stars. The service  was excellent, the chicken was excellent, the bun was fresh.  They have coke products. The price was right. Oh I almost forgot the wedge fries were just the best. So there you have it 5 stars."}
{"text":"We all know the food is delicious. I'm pleased that they offer healthy side dishes. Yay! My side salad had real lettuce, you know the kind with vitamins in it. What's the point of eating a salad made from iceberg? None. 

This location is very busy and it was lunch time so we opted to pick up with the drive thru. The order taker was super nice and professional as was the young man that gave us our food. I appreciate that they repeat everything that was ordered as they hand you your bags, I felt confident the order was correct. 

Great food and the service everyone expects from this chain."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location over the past 8 years, and they have done consistently well. However, today was rather disappointing. My wife goes thru the drive-thru weekly, on Wednesdays, to get our meal following my daughter's swim class. Today, when she gets home with our order, we discover her #1 sandwich is really 5 x sausage patties, and my grilled sandwich is fried. I can care little about my sandwich being fried, but the sausage patties were rather a surprise.

I decided to drive up, as my wife had little time to get ready for work. I got the attention of the general manager, and i presented my order. His initial reaction was to make it funny, and state the cooks would get a kick out of this. I didn't find it funny. I found the whole thing very inconveniencing. So, he proceeded to switch out my sausage patties with what we ordered. The order was correct this time. However, for my inconvenience, he gave me free nuggets for my daughter. Really?! Free food for the 15 minutes of driving and replacing my order...

Even though this location has been consistent in the past, I have to say this was by far the worst customer service I have received from them. Along with the older gentleman who still works there that I saw taking cell phone pictures of a young girl as she stood in line, this place needs some better understanding of customer service and keeping a safe environment for its patrons."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins drive thru, thats fine, got back to work with $50 worth of food, specifically asked lady if everything in bag she said yes, both sandwiches  were wrong, they added cheese deluxe, I wanted plain regular chicken sandwich pickle, standard order they mess up, allergic to cheese, didnt include my chicken nuggets, what do I do drive all the way back waste another hour, no just throw in trash, always a big chic fil a fan in dallas, not anymore , very dissapointed"}
{"text":"We have been a few times now and every time has been super consistent. I get the spicy chicken sandwich, it is great! The last couple of times I have added the Chick-fil-A sauce to the sandwich and it made even better!!!
The food is really good for a fast food place, but what makes this place a five star is the service. Maybe it is just for the \"grand opening\", but every visit has had exceptional service. They really go above and beyond to make sure you have your food quickly, that the restaurant is clean, and they quickly react whenever a request is made.
I went with my grandson and they got him a highchair, cleaned the already clean table, and placed a plastic placemat (with sticky tape sides, so it doesn't pull up) down for him to eat off of. Mind you this was done without me asking for a thing. They just did it because......and they did it smiling and asking can I get you anything? They really seem happy to working here and serving people. If you are like me and have lived in Vegas for a long time you know that at any and all fast food places, this is a phenomenon."}
{"text":"WOW this is the one and only Chick-fil-A in Canada. That means I have to come here and check this place out. So I got a deluxe chicken burger. It was very delicious. Chicken was nice and juicy. The chicken patty was nice and thick. 

You have to ask for the special chick-fil-a sauce. The sandwich was really good. 

Only thing is that this Chick-fil-A is in the airport before going through security. So if you want to eat here than you have come early."}
{"text":"New spicy chicken sandwich rocks!  They started taking orders in person at the drive-thru during lunch time rush to push customers through quicker.  This place is always clean, and the service is beyond any other fast food place.  Plus all sandwiches are under 500 calories!  Oh and the lemonade here is heaven, not that crap you get in the fountain machines at normal places."}
{"text":"If they had a Chick-fil-A in Vegas, I would definitely be a regular.  I love this place and just about everything on the menu is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual!! BUT the service at this location was EXCELLENT!! They certainly know all about customer service!! What a difference for a fast food place!!"}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwiches ever! The staff is friendly and they make sure the dining room is always clean. All the tables have small flower vases in the center which just makes anyone feel great just sitting there.
 
The kid's play area allows your child to have a little fun before or after you eat. It's small but completely safe. a
Located in the corner of the restaurant providing great vantage points for you to keep a close eye on your kids
The chicken and veggies taste very fresh. Great choices of dipping sauces. My favorite is barbecue. The lemonade here is incredible!

Kudos to Dominique for her excellent customer service. She always had a genuine smile when I was ordering and was very polite. Thank you for another great experience at Chik-Fil-A!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!  I love the service and the food is awesome!!!  I always keep coming back and always purchase the food for my team at work. Thanks Chick-fil-a"}
{"text":"The worst CFA in the area. Workers are rude and make going here frustrating. Rather drive a few miles to the next exit for a much better experience. Avoid this location. Do not care about customers."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chick-fil-A in the valley the employees enjoy their job they pay attention to keeping the food fresh something simple as ice tea never tastes bitter great place to go"}
{"text":"I'll give pretty much any Chick-fil-A 5 stars. Consistent good food, amazon service, and not the most unhealthy fast food place out there. I go here several times a week and am always impressed by how delicious their chicken is."}
{"text":"I tried the Cobb salad the other day at the eastern location and loved it, especially the avocado lime dressing. Craved it so much, went to this location before work to grab one..... got to work and open it up, there was no chicken. Was so disappointed! :/"}
{"text":"Waited in a super long drive through line then made me go park and wait for another 10 minutes just as I gave up and went to get my money back they finally brought my food went home for food that supposedly was made fresh tasted like crap I only get Chick-fil-A once in a while like a special treat this is the first time I've had a bad experience but I promise I will not be back even my kid won't eat the chicken strips because they taste so bad"}
{"text":"I stopped by Chick-fil-A because it was conveniently located near Great Northern Mall. This particular Chick-fil-A is always crazy busy, so much so that I had to park my car and go inside because the drive thru line is always out to the street. This was my first visit to Chick-fil-A, and I wanted to get all of the hype. I felt the need to be slightly healthy, so I ordered a cobb salad. The avocado ranch dressing was awesome! I still don't get all of the hype--I think I probably had to order a fried chicken sandwich and fries. Inside was totally packed, but they were able to get my food out quickly."}
{"text":"Oh my golly! I love chick fil a! Their nuggets with that buffalo sauce!!! Whoooooo weeeee! Trust. Get yourself whatever meal you like there. But you HAVE to get chick fil a sauce, Polynesian, and buffalo sauce!! This will change your world. Once you have your food, open your three sauces, then dip your fry into one of them, and take a bite! Do the same steps with your next bite except into the next sauce! It's gonna be a party in your mouth!! You shall no longer have lonely nights because of that party goin on. Except sundays. Sundays are lonely because chick fil a is closed on sundays."}
{"text":"Thought the politics leave something to be desired, you should still go to Chick-Fil-A.  This location was clean, service was friendly and we went when almost no one was there.  

Consistent with the Chick-Fil-A experience that converts have come to know & love."}
{"text":"Love Chic Fil A & love this location. Food is always great, the staff are super friendly & my daughter loves meeting her friends here to eat & play. The waffle fries are a huge hit with everyone & I think it is awesome they give out balloons to the children .... the only possible way to entice them away from the play area & home! My favorite menu item is the chicken wrap dipped in their delicious spicy sauce : )"}
{"text":"Fix the drive-thru service please! The lines are tremendously long and slow even during a weeknight, like 20 minutes. Make sure you bring a magazine or book to read. However, the staff is friendly and the food is great."}

{"text":"Just was here 8:45pm Saturday night. The worst and I mean the worst place to even try to eat . Such a limited menu well anyway to the experience. We walked out to hit the drive thru to get my wife chicken soup and grilled nuggets. 
 Now not only do they not give a military discount but they sound proud of it as the girl said no only police. 
  Went to the window and then they said they had no soup. But they charged me for it. 
 Got my money back for the soup they didn't even care. This is such a sad place,hope my wife likes the nuggets. We went to the Best wok for their chicken soup for my wife. Chick fil a insulting to Veterans and military and they don't credit back your card either. 
 Glad I don't come here and remember why I don't or stopped. 
  All brothers military and people with a cold don't come here man.
 Update wife said the nuggets were dry as rocks."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! It was my 7yo grandson's chance to get lunch with his grandpa. He ordered his own food and not only were they very professional with him and treated him with respect, even though he was only 7, the food choices were what Grandpa was happy with! Grilled chicken choice for children's nuggets, not just the breaded fried style! Waffle fries are great. They are bigger and have plenty of pockets to grab up ketchup! 
The best part came in the dining room. Even if it wasn't a trip with my grandson, it would have been one of the best places to go for lunch. Not only is the facility new, but the Chick-fil-a worker in the dining room, Jacobi, she was a doll! She was so helpful. She was cleaning in the dining room throughout the entire time keeping busy with misc. cleaning, but she would get right on cleaning up after patrons when they looked like they were piling there trash, she would offer to take it for them. She did more than your normal fast food worker though, she was very pleasant and engaging. That caught me as refreshing from the ordinary worker that looks away, keeps their head down, doesn't speak good English or is just generally not interested in being polite, engaging and professional. Jacobi heard my grandson run out of his drink and she made the effort to come over to our table and offer to run his cup up and get him a refill. 
I love this place. I know you might say, just fast food joint, but if you are going to do anything I say getting the right people with the right attitudes makes all the difference in the world! Kudos to Jacobi, her boss and Chick-fil-a!
Oh, and it does t hurt that the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great  nuff said.     I'm forced to say more.  Best chicken sandwich.  There must be something  in it that addictive.     My favorite  chicken  restaurant"}
{"text":"I am a big chick-fil-a fan.  Was very happy when this one opened at the airport.  Over the months I have eaten here quality has gone into the dumper.  Ate here today and saw a ton of pre cooked food on the window.  Granted my order came out within 30 seconds of the order, but fries were cold and way over salted and chicken sandwich was also cold.  Very sad."}
{"text":"I live on the egg white grill every morning. Healthy and stocked with protein. I just wish they would carry that item all day, not just for breakfast. 

Overall this is an awesome fast food joint! Staff is always super courteous and responsive, and the quality of the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I really wanted some chicken noodle soup & we all know Chick foil a has the BEST soup. Unfortunately it was cold as ice & I the serving was smaller than usual."}
{"text":".Okay don't judge me! I understand I'm about to review a fast food place but this is one of those times I felt it needed to be done. I so love their chicken sandwiches they are second to none in the fast food world but what I was more impressed with was the great customer service I received when I went to this location. It's not often you get great customer service at a fast food place these days so when it happens I thinks it's important to call it out. I may not agree with the company's outlook on life but they make one hell of a chicken sandwich and their employees seem very happy to be working there which is more than I can say for 99% of the other fast food hell holes. I will enjoy coming back time after time and if you are In Mentor and you need something fast its worth stopping by for some yard bird sandwiches. That's right I said sandwiches with an s because it's hard to eat just one"}
{"text":"I don't usually don't yelp fast food places but this one is a special one.

They had a daddy/daughter date night.  We even had to make a reservation.  They have a lot of these theme nights which I think are so cool.

We ordered from the regular menu but we were waited on.  We even got dessert.

I love their chicken.  Seasoned right all the time.  And the breakfast biscuits are the bestest!!!"}
{"text":"We love their chicken! So happy to finally have one in Vegas. We went through the drive thru and they were super fast. Total 15 minutes and we were on our way. Pretty impressive for such a crowded place!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Literally the worst Chickfila experience I have had so far out of all the times I have been. First, the blonde girl taking my order was rude and made an off comment asking me if I had ever been to \"A Chickfila\" cause I couldnt find the sandwich I was looking for.

Then when I asked for 8 buffalo sauces for the entirety of my group order the blonde specifically ignored me and put only 6 on the order. I had to wait off to the side and get more.

Then after we got our meal delivered to the table we found out the sandwich was wrong. My girlfriend was so hungry she started eating it while I went to get the correct sandwich. I waited in line again for 10 minutes to get my order fixed and the manager was also extremely rude! She asked me to prove i was wrong and walk back up with the sandwich. 

Finally she grabbed the sandwich and gave me another semi hot sandwich with unmelted cheese. 

In conclusion, I barely scratched the surface of how bad of an experience we had. I just dont want to write anymore. If a company is going to have that expensive of fast food, they should at least be courteous. Im never going to this Chickfila again."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a quick lunch! Everyone who works here is super friendly and the food is always fresh!! The spicy southwest salad is so yummy! The owner is also super friendly which keeps me coming back again and again!! Eat more chicken haha"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good chicken sandwich and the waffle fries were tasty too!

The kids got fun toys in their meals. My brother-in-law got some grilled chicken that looked pretty pathetic and he said it didn't taste good either.

Overall it was a good experience and the place seemed pretty clean which I appreciate that!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. Glad I had the chance when I was in NC! I was surprised that the girl who took my order brought my tray out to my table. 
Seems nice and all but could suck if they got busy. 

I tried the chicken nuggets and the waffle fries. Decent food, wasn't mind blowing or anything but worth the try. In retrospect I should have gotten a bigger piece of chicken to get a better representation of their chicken but I wasn't very hungry. 

A plus was that the bathroom was clean - and everything was germaphobe friendly. Sani seats and I didn't have to touch anything to wash my hands or leave the bathroom!

Overall I liked it, would eat here again."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch today and noticed a few things.  I went inside because the drive-thru line was really long.

1. This place always seems to be packed both inside & out.

2. The food is not bad, the choices are grilled or fried, nuggets or strips and if you get a meal it comes with waffle fries and drink.

3.  They have more employees working at one time then any other fast food place.  Also every employee seems happy to be there and to help in any way the can.   They are kind, polite, respectful and like I said willing to help any way they can to make your visit an amazing one.

The food is not bad either, like I said in the sandwiches, grilled or fried are the choices and you can get lettuce, tomato and cheese if you desire."}
{"text":"You can only hear a chicken restaurant mentioned in the news so many times before you give in and try it...

My maiden voyage to Chick-fil-A was heavenly. 

Went with chicken strips and waffle fries. 

The chicken strips were moist and juicy. The waffle fries were crisp and tasty. 

Most of the time when a place like this is hyped as being really good what people mean is that it's really good for an inexpensive fast food restaurant. 

In-N-Out is the best example of this. 

People go there for the first time expecting a world class burger. 

What they get is a really good fast food burger that's better than anything else in that price range. 

Chick-fil-A is different. 

Chick-fil-A chicken can go head to head best overpriced \"as seen on the Food Network\" chicken restaurant out there.  

I want to thank my overly zealous political friends on the left and right for clogging my Facebook feed about this place for past 5 years. 

I should have tried it sooner!"}
{"text":"I always get the #2. However , I ALWAYS say NO PICKLE but somehow end up with 3 of those pickles chilling beneath the cheese like it's supposed to be there ... I'm offended because I'm a consistent customer , I'm still going but I needed to rant a lil about the pickle issue ?"}
{"text":"I love Chick fil A usually, but this location always messes up on my order. I ordered chicken nuggets last time, and I received a kids chicken tenders. Today, I order a chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese, and they didn't put silverware in the bag. Go figure."}
{"text":"This used to be a family favorite - even after they raised the prices.  However, for the past several months our orders are wrong, and still not corrected after returning item to the counter.  The final straw for me was the waffle fries - when they're good, they're really good.  We had asked for our fries to be \"well done\".  When they were not, we were given another order of fries.  This time not only were the fries not \"well done\", there were raw potatoes in the container.  
There always seems to be enough staff, and everyone is very friendly, but I can get bad food almost anywhere, for a lot less money."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try Chick-fil-A after that whole incident in 2015. Not for CFA's stance but because I witnessed even the most out spoken critics concede to the fact that this place makes great chicken and they wont stop eating there.

So I find myself in AZ (not even from here) and my group and I happen upon this fine establishment the day after T-day. The group I was with excitedly told the drive thru attendant that it was my first time at CFA. 

She welcomed me and comped my order! I was a little blown away. 

As expected, it was delicious. Thank you Scottsdale CFA! Though next time you're taking my money ;)"}
{"text":"Best service in town,  pretty impressive in a place that prides itself on high end dining like Vegas does."}
{"text":"I've been to this Chick-fil-A multiple times and my order has been wrong more often than not. Unfortunate because I love the food but it's not worth it if I won't even receive what I've paid for."}
{"text":"I love CFA but this CFA was extremely dirty. The station w straws, napkins and condiments was unorganized and there was trash all over the floor. I stepped on a dirty fork that was also on the floor. I ordered the 8 ct nugget meal as I was grabbing food on the way to the movie and I received \"grilled\" unbreaded nuggets that were not even cooked and they were covered in grease. It looked like they just chopped up a chicken breast and served the slices as nuggets. Being in a rush I did not have time to check my food before leaving but I shouldn't have to just to make sure what I ordered was correct. I am extremely disappointed and angry that I wasted my money on this meal."}
{"text":"As a mom of 2 very active 3 & 5yr old boys, Chick-fil-A can be a lifesaving break in the day! This location is by far my favorite because it has the most incredible employees!!! I cannot remember all of their names but our absolute favorite one is Alex! We have been coming here since my boys were babies and he ALWAYS remembers us and greets my boys with a smile and the occasional special treat! They always look forward to seeing him and he constantly comes by to interact with all the kids and parents! You can tell when someone is trying to smile and when someone genuinely wants to brighten your day and he is one of those special individuals! Thank you Alex for always making our visits incredible! The food is good but the people are what bring us back!"}
{"text":"Visited this Chick Fil A a few times. Each time we order the large size waffle fries. Every time we get about half our order, see pics. These are pics from several different orders. Even though we pay the full price of a large size waffle fries. Also if you order correctly and they mix up your order, they will not fix your order. They will offer to send out vouchers. No apology will be given. Even if you call when you are still parked in their parking lot. Make sure you check the amount you paid for. Do better Chick Fil A!"}
{"text":"Love Chick-Fil-A breakfast!!! Wish they served fresh skim or 2 percent milk with their coffee. I don't like the little creamers that are non dairy. yuk"}
{"text":"Just love this place!"}
{"text":"Oh, Chic-fil-A how I love thee. Let me count the ways...
1. Good food
2. Fast service
3. Friendly staff
4. A clean store
5. Philanthropic giving

Our two boys love coming here for dinner. We will use any excuse to come. We have never had a bad meal or experience."}
{"text":"Make sure you go through the drive through \"the right way\".  I was refused service at the drive through after accidentally pulling in the parking lot then going to the drive through. I got to the window and they said they wouldn't serve me and if I had a problem to see Tom inside because I \"didn't drive around the building the right way.\"  Is this a real policy to refuse paying customer's money?  

Before they try to say I cut someone off or something else, there was no one behind me.  There were two cars in front of me and none behind me when I got to the speaker.  

I left and went to another nearby business and won't return here.  Even with their prior bad press, paying customers clearly mean nothing and they don't need our money that badly.   Fine by me. :)."}
{"text":"I love coming to Chick-Fil-A in general, but this location is the best of them all.  Today I did a lousy job communicating what I wanted to Mike.  When he brought me my our order it wasn't what I expected.  I told him and of course they fixed it right away, even though I think it was my lack of clarity that caused the mixup.  The icing on the cake was that Mike came back twice to apologize.  Heck there wasn't even anything to apologize for!  CFA raises the bar yet again!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend always wants this place and I never do.  It's not that the food is bad because it really is tasty.  I just get sick of always having it...  Seems to come up as that quick place to grab a  bite.

Even though I whine about this place, I do enjoy it.  This weekend at the Phoenix Film Festival we ate here on Sunday and the food was once again yum.

I guess I do the forbidden with my waffle fries, but I like to dip them in mayonnaise.  What else do you put on them? Catchup?? ewwww..  ruins the taste.  I get crap for it, but why do you think they put the mayo out there?  Oh what? it's for the chicken sandwich? Ahhh.. Oh well. 

The nuggets are awesome and if you can, top it off with some good ole sweet tea. 

The odd and really cool thing about Chick Fil A is that the people are ridiculously nice here. \"Hi, welcome to Chick Fil A, how may I server you?\"  Who says that?  

One time I saw one of their female employees actually carry two bags of food out to this one guys car.. with him.   As nice as it was, Ive never seen so many people look at him in disgust.  I get allowing people to be nice, but don't be a punk and take advantage of them.    

It's like going to the grocery store after buying a pack of gum and when they ask to help, you say \"sure.\"  Just not cool.  Anyways..  they are great here."}
{"text":"If anyone was ever been to Chick-fil-A, you'll notice a few things..

1.  How incredibly polite their employees are \"Hi, how may I serve you today?\"
2.  How good the food is
3.  How polite they remain...

We had lunch here this past weekend and once again a very nice young tween took our order with a smile from ear to ear.  I paid, and shortly our food was ready to go.   I like to eat mayonnaise with my chicken nuggets while my girlfriend eats a mixture of their chick-fil-a sauce and the Polynesian sauce.  It's good, trust me..    The place was packed, so my girlfriend stood to scope out a table when one would be available.  She found it.  We sat in the most perfect spot for people watching.. I love to people watch. I could do it all day.

Funny moment though...

One of the employees dropped one lonely nugget on the ground and for ten minutes, we sat and watched people walk over this one nugget.  The employee that dropped it stepped over it.. (not exagerating) 8 times.  He kept looking at us like \"What??\"  ...we just grinned.  It was fun.  Finally he picked it up.

Good place, good food, good times."}
{"text":"This place just opened up a few months ago and my girlfriend was thrilled because she loves this place.  I enjoy some Chick-fil-A, but  have grown to get tired of the same stuff.

BUT...

They have the best waffle fries and their nuggets are pretty dang tasty.  I love this location (i assume most are like this) because the people there are so insanely nice.  Who says \"How may i serve you?\"

One time we were eating there and this server was helping a guy with his food and asked \"Could  I help you out with these?\"  He was alone, probably 30's, and had two free hands.. she walks out with three bags and having trouble moving.  The entire place was watching in awe as he let her carry his food to his car.  Who does that??  Chick-fil-A does..  

The drive-thru likes to fool you though.. as a male.. I pull up and hear this sweet sweet voice \"Hi, welcome to Chick-fil-A, how may I serve you?\"  Of course I get why people do this.. females just come off as more pleasant.  But once you pull up to the window, it's some weird old guy..... bah..   Oh well.

Still a good place to eat."}
{"text":"After several visits to the Chick-fil-A in Madison Wisconsin to have their chicken fillet sandwich, I decided to try their chicken strips because of my disappointment in the size of KFCs chicken strips. Unfortunately, Chick-fil-A's chicken strips are 1/3 smaller than KFC's and cost more.
My recommendation to Chick-fil-A is to removed the chicken strips from their menu.

{"text":"It's 10:45 AM and I have been in this drive-through for almost 20 minutes. The line is not that long, but I have never been in a Chick-fil-A drive through that is this slow.  I just watched the car in front of me drive away, which is probably going to mess up my order. As I write this, car behind me is driving away also. I have always had good experiences with Chick-fil-A but today is not one of them."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had an issue with my order, I found an opened safety pin in my market salad and i was given the wrong dressing per my request, the kids meal was wrong as well. I called back to the store (Matthews) on Independence blvd. once i arrived home and  made the discovery of  the pin in my salad, a crew leader answered the phone and he asked me, Now how would a pin get  into a salad? Thats what i needed to know, but its not up to me to give such an explanation. I told him to ask a manager to call me the next business day for this occurred after 6 pm im sure most  managers were gone for the day. This is my third situation at this location. No manager ever called me back, so I went to the store today,  spoke with a manager.  Why is it the manager (slim white blonde dude) stood there trying to defend the situation.  Not one time did he apologize nor offered to reimburse my money for my non-
edible order. I don't do poor customer service. Which is exactly what that was. I did follow up with corporate and I am expecting a call back,  we will see how soon  this happens, to be continued."}
{"text":"I give this Chik Fila and every Chik Fila 5 stars. Why? Because they have taken something very common with a mediocre at best, AT BEST, reputation - fast food - and have redefined it. Quality of service and design and taste has come to the fast food industry by Chik Fila. 

I'm a big fan of their chicken strips and their Chik Fila sandwhich (but I remove the bottom bun and eat the pickles first). Their honey BBQ sauce is my favorite sauce for the chicken, and sometimes you need to ask for it because it's not out with your more common condiments. I also like their regular BBQ sauce with their waffle fries. If you like an amazing combination of sweetness and tartness - get a frosted lemonade. Actually, in general, their
lemonade is good. Real good. I get that every time instead of a soda. Iced coffee is very good but extremely sweet. Almost too sweet. But I like it as a treat in the summer. Milkshakes, incredible. 

The service at this restaurant is amazing. Great employees with great attitudes.

Chik Fila lifehack: say \"thank you\" and they have to respond \"my pleasure.\" 

I take advantage of that lifehack more than I should. I'm just so amused by it. 

There's a playplace in this Chik Fila if you have kids! 

I also like how there's fresh flowers on the tables. I mean, wow. Is this fast food or what? 

If you haven't been to Chik Fila you haven't lived. The only negative I have for this place is the addicting nature of their food. You'll want to keep coming back. 

You should."}
{"text":"It's basically just a McDonald's with a \"couple\" different menu items. My chicken was DRY and the bun tasted OLD AND STALE! Also, got a stomach ache from the food! The food is LACKLUSTER... I don't see what all the hype is about. Also had to wait and pull over for my food because they FORGOT about my order! R u kidding me?! About 20 minutes waiting in the LINE in the drive thru, then an additional 10 minutes after I ordered my food! Then after I paid waited 15 ADDITIONAL MINUTES! I wasted my gas and time for this place! Burger King or In n Out would have been a better choice than this place! Fast food?! I don't think so, so be prepared to wait a LONG TIME! Save the hassle and stress, and just go to In n Out, their wayyy better and consistent and much more efficient!!! Sorry Chick-fil-A, but you get a big fat F!"}
{"text":"Not quite as good as the other one on Mayo, but still very deserving of the 4 stars - I'd rate it 4.5 if I could. The only difference here was no one cleared our table and no offers for refills. However, they did give me an extra Diet Dr. Pepper!

Place was clean throughout, staff was friendly and welcomed us to the place! 

I haven't ever had bad Chick-Fil-A no matter where I go!"}
{"text":"How does a \"food\" place of any kind get 5 stars from Traveling Tom?

Serve him good tasting food with flavor. Do so quickly in a clean restaurant by extremely friendly people who go out of their way to make you feel important. Offer him a restroom where he can leave feeling cleaner and better then when he entered it and have plenty of close by free parking. Accept his credit card with a smile and ensure that the table he is going to sit at is clean. 

This place did it all and therefore - they get 5 stars. Maybe I hit a good day - maybe this is normal, but I most likely will return here before my vacation is over with. 

Nice job and a special shout out to Michael who offered to refill my drink and haul our trash away for us!"}
{"text":"Another 5 star Chick-fil-a - YES!

I know there are some people who keep asking me - how do you give a fast food place 5 stars? And here is what I tell them ...

Any place is capable of receiving 5 stars - all they have to do is the following:

1) Offer great tasting food at a great price 
2) Offer me a clean establishment where I can eat this incredible food 
3) Treat me as if it's truly your honor that I'm there and not a disturbance 
4) Give me choices
5) Don't make me wait to order or for my food

This is another place that took my order quickly - brought my order to my table - cleaned the garbage off my table - brought refills - and the owner even took time to talk to us. The bathrooms were impeccably clean and offered safe changing areas for children and all the workers seemed to be smiling. This is the way it should be done and I am happy to give out a 5 star!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst locations I've ever been to - the food wasn't hot, the service wasn't good at all! If they don't improve - I seriously do not know if they will last! Hopefully I went on an off day!"}
{"text":"By far the most disorganized Chick-fil-A I've visited. No rope line which causes great confusion for the elderly during busy periods. Their confusion leads to extensive delays for those of us who aren't yet elderly."}
{"text":"We went here last week and it was awesome. Being from the south, I've missed Chick fil A. It's still a bit of a drive, but worth it. The line was insane, but they were properly staffed and it moved very fast. Friendly workers, great food, and happy customers!  This doesn't really matter for the rating, but my son LOVED the toy in the happy meal. It was a build your own finger puppet thing and it kept him quiet for a while so it gets an extra thumbs up from me!! The sweet tea could have used some more sugar, but it was still good and I kinda go overboard on my sugar anyway. We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I had ordered a kid's meal for my toddler. She has an allergy to apples and we always get her a fruit cup with no apples and don't have an issue getting it since it's allergy related. Well, today we couldn't get a fruit cup with no apples because the new trainee  and her trainer  decided that this was no longer allowed and so my daughter couldn't get the fruit she loves. There wasn't a manager visible or else I would have talked to someone right then. We've had issues with this in the past but as long as we make people aware it's because of an allergy, we don't have a problem. These two were VERY rude about it and it'll be quite some time before returning. Which is sad because we were going to go to their Circus event this week. 

It seems that ever since their management/owner change, things have gotten worse service-wise. Which they weren't all that great to begin with since they already ran off all the awesome employees months ago! We'll go to Goodyear if we need a CFA fix!"}
{"text":"Always to go this Chick-fil-A location since it's closer to my place. Ordered through drive-thru spicy deluxe sandwich, they read me back the order at the pick up window and my receipt also shows spicy deluxe and label on the sandwich box also shows spicy deluxe. Came back and opened the box and it's grilled sandwich, how come the order go wrong at three different check points. Is this way u run a successful franchise with bunch of folks who does not know how to run the process flow for delivering a simple order. Management needs to wake up at least now, also see bunch of reviews the same way.

Got to drive back again and change my order...staff inside have no clue how this happened and they apologize just because they got to say something.

Bunch of lazy folks with no focus on customer service are running this location. Stay away !!!"}
{"text":"Went thru drive thru around 3 pm 4/19/16
Got 2 medium fries, 12 nuggets and a Cfa sandwich extra pickles. Well I got home and the fries were half full and I got ONE extra pickle.  Come on guys I feel ripped off! Picture to come"}
{"text":"Go to spot for breakfast.  Always ho with the spicy chicken bagel with jack cheese.  Son loves their eggs.   Something for every1.  Coffee is good.  Service always good."}
{"text":"Garbage customer service, $8 for 6 stale cookies, I even asked the guy why so much? He said every order is baked fresh. BS he had me grab the display ones because they close to closing and all of a sudden the cookie machine down, such a rude punk kid"}
{"text":"This has to be the best Chick-Fil-A there is. Philip the owner is amazing and does such a great job. You can't go wrong with heading to this Chick-Fil-A I go here at least three times a week and I have never had an issue. If there is a mistake (only happened once out of 100 times), everybody makes mistakes, they are quick to fix it and went above and beyond. Couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Is it just me or has the size and ( box ) of the chick strips have SHRUNK?"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Period. The reason it's so overcrowded is because it's new to the Las Vegas region. It was definitely over hyped. Is it worth a try? Sure. Is it memorable? No. Many of the employees don't look happy working there which always throws me off. I haven't had any messed up orders which is a good thing. The only thing is l really like is the frosted coffee."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the fascination or draw to this place?

We had a coupon and while visiting my parents in the area decided to stop for a quick bite.

We all ordered the waffle fries and spicy chicken sandwich. Both were soggy and didn't appeal to our taste buds one bit.

Suppose it has a lot to do with the fact that none of us enjoy fast food but I really was expecting more on my sandwich other than a lone, sad looking pickle.

Service was decent and everyone looked squeaky clean (as I'm sure they all do working in such a strict Christian establishment) but that didn't make up for our disappointing meal."}
{"text":"My husband was in the drive thru yesterday morning when his car just died. He was beyond frustrated and embarrassed when two employees came out to help him push his car to a parking space. They even brought him his order and told him not to worry about paying for it because he had bigger things to worry about. :) I just wanted to share that experience with you. That the staff was so kind and helpful and was not in any way annoyed by this inconvenience."}
{"text":"I wanted to know what the hype was all about so  i tried this place Staff was really nice and helpful The food was pretty good I only tried the chicken sandwich and Im going to try there original chik sandwich I can't wait  For my next time I'm here"}
{"text":"You guys, Chick-fil-A's service never ceases to amaze me. I keep coming back for the flavorful food and to be \"served\" by their fabulous staff (as they say in the drive thru: \"How may I serve you?\"). 

My husband and I were visiting from NorCal and headed to PHX airport from the Grand Canyon. This location was about 1 mile off the freeway and the line was very quick (just one window where you pay and get your food). At first the line was really long and we could hear the lady a few cars in front of us asking very detailed questions about what the menu offered. I was impressed that the staff person taking the order was so patient and gave a friendly, customary \"my pleasure\" at the end of the exchange. 

If you've never been to Chick-fil-A, try the waffle fries and a regular chicken sandwich - and then come back and explore all the other quality options! On the original sandwich, the chicken is very moist and the bread is soft. The only decor is a couple pickles! We also tried the iced lemonade drink - a sweet blend of their ice cream and lemonade (think lemonade shake). Unreal!

Overall, I appreciate the consistent taste and  friendly service this chain provides, no matter where I am in the US! (The only thing is: don't crave Chick-fil-A on Sunday, as you will be sorely disappointed!)"}
{"text":"I love their frosted coffees, went out of my way on a Saturday morning to get one and at 9:30 in the morning they do not have their machine running. Why bother having them on the menu if you can't provide them in the morning when most people would want a coffee drink??"}
{"text":"I go to this chik-fil-a often on lunch and they are always very busy but very efficient. Everyone is super friendly and kind, never had a bad experience at this location"}
{"text":"Subsequent visit update:  My Chick-Fil-A app (free download, tracks purchases, and rewards me periodically) notified me that I had earned a free treat.  I do like having the choice of one of three items.  This being another grab and get back to work evening, I again used the drive through, and was glad to see that there were few vehicles in line (quicker winner, chicken dinner!).  As I ordered (number one sandwich, medium diet lemonade), I let the employee know that I was redeeming a treat on my app for the sandwich.  Got to the window, presented my phone for her to scan the code, and was given a balance due of $3+.  For a medium lemonade?  Should be $1.89 plus tax, yes?  They had included fries;  I did not want fries, just the sandwich and drink.  Recalculate, pay, thank you, have a good evening, and drive off into the sunset.  Wondering what the surprise would be this time (could they have possibly tossed a cookie into my bag?  I can dream, right?  Or ORDER a cookie, right?!), I unpacked to find the sandwich, fries (which they asked me to keep at no charge), napkins, and . . . no straw.  Glad I tucked away that unneeded straw from a couple of weeks ago (then again, I am perfectly capable of drinking a cup of lemonade without the aid of a straw, so this is a minor annoyance).  The food is yummy, the service, while not horrific, is just consistently inconsistent."}
{"text":"Still hungry after a disappointing sit down meal in the area, I went to Chick-fil-A to get a sandwich. The location was well kept and we were greeted when we first came in. I had the grilled chicken sandwich to go. It only took a few minutes to make and I was out the door in no time. 

I liked the sandwich multigrain bun, tomatoes and fresh green leaf lettuce. Unfortunately I didn't like the actual grilled chicken which was super salty to me. It's fast food though so hey what do you expect.

Service was friendly at the cashier and my total was less than $5 for the sandwich.

I wasn't too impressed with the sandwich but it was more satisfying than my actual dinner for the price I paid so it definitely had that going for it!"}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food, I have refused to go anywhere with a drive through for the last 10 years but Chick Fil A is the exception! They're amazing and have great Chick Fil A sauce."}
{"text":"The one thing I'll complain about is the price increase. I get it that businesses in the airport have to up-charge their price points because of airport fees or whatnot, but as a consumer I don't appreciate paying higher for something I receive equally at another location for the same store.

This place gets pretty crazy so give yourself some time if you're trying to have enough time to eat and get to your gate. For the amount of customers that come and wait in line they do a pretty good job of taking orders and serving efficiently and effectively.

I had an incident where I ordered large fries and was given medium fries. I informed the worker immediately and she reviewed my order, took my medium fries and threw it away and gave me large fries. I thought the same thing everyone else would think, \"whyyyy did you waste the fries!\" I get why they did that, but they could've just...allowed me to keep their mistake and just give me another medium fries or something to make it equal to a large? That would've been my solution haha =]"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the GCU campus. Newly opened Chick-Fil-A express offers a few limited selections. A regular or grilled sandwich, a salad, fries, and drinks. No lemons for the tea, but otherwise okay. Several registers open helps the line move, but with 8500 students living on campus still expect a wait. A sandwich with cheese, medium fries, and large beverage for $6.33. Cheese available in American or Pepper Jack."}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A... the spicy chicken sandwhiches, the lemonade, the soup, the brownies... So I am a bit biased due to it being one of my mom's favorite fast food joints and a special out of town treat growing up (we didn't have these in my home state of Washington!). There's just something about chicken, pickles, and mayo that works. :-)"}
{"text":"Totally a fan.  Great food, much better than any other fast food chicken place.  Healthy options.  Caters to kids, no small task there!  Love this place.  Great coupon policy too, they take expired coupons and multiple ones.  Buy their calender in Dec. it will save you a lot of money.  BTW they use real whole chicken breast."}
{"text":"Their Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap had a very small portion of chicken pieces and was bulked up with excessive lettuce.  Very disappointing and will never return back to this over rated restaurant!

Their staff needs more training/experience."}
{"text":"You're better off going to the one inside northlake mall. They are polite but the food is always off somehow. This time I ordered the chicken noodle soup. Easy right? Every chick fila I order it from it's always good. But from this location it was nothing but broth and celery in it. The was literally ONE piece of chicken in the whole soup. I'm not sure If they are saving money or what. But no other location I've been to is like that. And it sucks bc chick fila is already pricy compared to most fast food. I would at least expect more effort with the food."}
{"text":"The food is exactly like every other Chick-fil-A, of course. But the tea is awful, like it's always old, and in the morning it takes 20-25 minutes to get through the drive through in the mornings. 

Perhaps make some more biscuits and hash browns  in the morning so they are ready. I am not a fast food production expert but that seems like a good idea."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. They can't keep up  in wiping their tables,seats and floors clean.And  also keep the restroom clean. They do have a lot of employees ,maybe they should be focusing helping in keeping up the place clean. This place is fairly new but even the outside concrete floor is needing some pressure washing. Other than the things mentioned above, the food and the service are still very good, the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"We always get great service and the majority of the time the food is good. My husband and I on separate occasions ordered the Cobb salad and both got food poisoning. We've both had this salad before and haven't gotten sick but sad to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went to Chick-fil-A at this location this morning. Finally is Saturday and I have time to get my favorite chicken minis. Pull up to the drive-through, place my order only to be told I'm sorry we are out of chicken minis today. How can you be out of chicken minis at a chicken only restaurant  on an early Saturday morning? This is very disappointing.  especially when this is the only reason I came here. Not to mention it's a royal pain in the butt to back out of a drive thru!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the taste of their chicken sandwiches but honestly this is the most expensive chicken sandwich in the fast food industry. AND, the buns and chicken breasts have seemed to shrink significantly over the last 2 or 3 years. The service is always top notch."}
{"text":"We in the C-household are fans of Chick-Fil-A.  So when I was out at my moms last weekend, we were in need of lunch while we were out.  So I suggested the C-F-A on 99th.
  
OH...If you're a parent of a little one, I didnt know but thanks to one of the employees, I discovered they had these plastic mats to stick to the table for your LO to eat off of.  AWESOME IDEA!   Now if only I could get Baby C to leave it sticking to the table while he's eating....  lol

Clean establishment.  Courtious employees.  Killer Chicken.  :)"}
{"text":"Rude! Sitting in the drive thru and the girl on mic needs a lesson in manners.  I had a coupon and asked if I could pay the difference between the chicken deluxe sandwich and the spicy chicken deluxe...  which I've done numerous times in the past at that location. her response to me in an abrupt tone, \"No!\" Uhh..okay I've done so in the past. \"No you can't.\" I ask to speak to a manager.  the manager informed me there's been a change in policy and you can only get what item is stated on the coupon. Okay that makes sense why I can't just pay the difference between the two items. What would have been appreciative is if the girl would have explained that there was a change in policy instead of just saying NO, with no explanation. the manager then says thank you and I sit there waiting to order a kids meal for little C and nobody comes back on the mic. thankfully the kid at the window was nice enough to let me complete my order and he got everything out to me really fast. 

Aside from the health benefits, I am reminded of yet another reason why I do not eat fast food anymore (J wanted CFA)."}
{"text":"I think the chicken that is used is fed crack before processing, because it is that tasty.  I hate using the term moist, but this chicken is uber moist and tender.  

UGH..moist.  But there are not any other words suitable to use in place of moist.  
Hmm a few synonyms for moist - Clammy, oozy, drippy, dank.  Thankfully Chick Fil A's chicken isnt  any of those.  If it was, we'd have a problem.  I guess I'll have to stick with moist.  Shudder.  lol 

The waffle fries are awesome, especially when dipped in Polynesian sauce.  And to quote Jules from Pulp Fiction..the diet lemonade -  \"a tasty beverage\".  

The Customer Service - EXEMPLARY!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this spot doesn't have 5 stars!!

I had never had chic-fil-a before, so seeing it while driving around made me and my boyfriend excited. 

We stopped in for lunch and the level of customer service that our cashier had was so incredible. Better than the customer service I've had at some expensive restaurants in nyc! 

I opted for a chicken sandwich and he had chicken fingers and it was delicious. Definitely worth the hype."}
{"text":"I love chick fil a. You can't beat their basic chicken sandwich, and the service is always friendly and quick. Everyone working there has a smile on their face. :) I've heard their milkshakes are awesome, but can't say I've had one yet. Next time!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is is always good for a chicken sandwich craving, didn't know they served breakfast until we saw a long line in the drive thru. I had the egg, cheese, chicken and biscuit breakfast meal with hash browns and a OJ. Very filling and appetizing, the OJ was very good along with the hash brown nuggets."}
{"text":"I visit this location on a Monday at 12:40ish and I'm expecting the obligatory lunch line that wraps around the building.  What I wasn't expecting was Jessica standing out in the heat taking both of my orders to get the line moving.  This lady was fantastic!  She was friendly, efficient, and made my drive thru experience very pleasant and quick!  Thanks Jessica!!  5 Stars  :-)"}
{"text":"Not sure what's happening at this location lately?  Today I went for lunch to find one of the drive thru lanes coned off and a woman standing in the other lane taking orders on her tablet.  I appreciate that they lean in during peak times, but there was also trash sitting outside the dumpster and pieces falling off from some mechanical something in the drive thru lane nearing the payment window.  I've also noticed a dramatic shift in their employees  :-(  I understand one can only hire those that apply, but try to remember that chic fil a has a higher standard than most so whomever you employ needs to be held to those standards.  This location seems to be cracking at the seams, I hope they recognize this and send in the Calvary before it's too far gone."}
{"text":"I visit this location infrequently, but frequently enough to notice the same lady standing at the very long drive through line taking orders in the heat.  That's the level of service that Chicfila offers at busy rush times and I so appreciate it, but WOW do I feel sorry for that lady.  She should have a tip jar because without her doing her part, we'd all be sitting in that line all day...  Thanks lady, I think you're awesome!  :-)"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them only 2 stars is that it took 20 mins. to go through the drive thru.  Seriously?  It made me late for an appointment.  I got the grilled chicken nuggets & they were amazing!  I love their food-just wish the drive thru could move a little faster."}
{"text":"We ordered a 30 pack of Chick fil A nuggets to sneak into the movie theater.  They were fresh & tasty.  They give you a ton of sauce so you don't run out.  Even though I feel it's overpriced we love going here when we are on this side of town."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while we were in Phoenix. Ordered the deluxe spicy chicken with American cheese. It was pretty good! Love the spicy batter and their wafer fries. 

Only complaint was that the chicken sandwich was not that spicy but that's about it!

Will definitely come here no matter what the politics say!"}
{"text":"I love chick fil a! It's always clean & everyone is so nice! I love that they have fun activities. Plus the food is amazing for fast food! It's the only fast food I like! 
The ice cream and shakes are the BEST!!"}
{"text":"I have long been a devoted Chick-fil-A fan and customer. The quality of their employees is really amazing. Bright shiny faces ,polite literate people who seem to enjoy their work. Not like the employees in some fast food places. Chicken and all ingredients are fresh and taste. They have discontinued my beloved cole slaw and replace with some good salads but I want my coleslaw back. My regular order? Number 4, 4 count with slaw and a diet coke can no longer be had!! Please bring it back! Anyway love me some Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"This place like most chic fil la's is great.  My order is almost always right and hot and fast.  A couple of weeks ago i went through the drive thru early during breakfast hours and asked if I could order a Cobb salad to eat later for lunch.  They obliged me and I went on my way only to find at lunch that there was no salad dressing.  When I called and explained my problem with the lady who answered she was very kind and asked me to come by and get another Cobb salad the next day.  Even when they mess up they make it right.   Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Food is standard fast food, but... They have very impressive operations to handle the heavy foot traffics during lunch hours. DMV needs to take note here. Also the workers there are surprisingly friendly."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is very biased because I love CHICK-FIL-A! It is like chicken crack to me. I used the mobile app which was very easy to set up and use. It only took 10 minutes to pick up my order in the designated app line. However, my order was missing a free extra which I requested on the app (e.g. buffalo sauce) Nonetheless, I will attribute that to the craziness of the first few days to work out the kinks and plus the new employees. What I do like about this chain is that it is always consistent with quality and service. Hopefully, this one will live up to the high standards as the others across our great country!

And to the clowns who gave a one star.....SO what is a five star for fast food? Burger King?"}
{"text":"The SLOWEST service!!! Doesn't matter what time of day you go, it takes 20-30mins to get your food. Has made me late for work multiple times and they've made me pull into a parking space for 10mins to wait for my food. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"You can't Possibly say anything bad about the restaurant it's clean the food is fresh and it's simple it's chicken a bun And a Pickle but it is one of those things that you will crave every once in a while nothing bad to say"}
{"text":"Doesn't seem like it's worth the money and time that ppl stand in line.  The fries were not hot but they weren't hard like most waffle fries.  I wasn't impressed by the chicken.  The watermelon  mint lemonade was refreshing.  I had the superfood side and that taste great it was actually the only thing i enjoyed besides the lemonade.  
Always busy

The employees are pleasant 

The restaurant is kept clean"}
{"text":"Today, June 3rd 2017, is receipt day. If you come into this metro location and order and save the yellow receipt, you will be able to get your order for free in July. The rules state that you can redeem your order at any point in July - there are not dates the offer is limited to."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Chick Filet Ever. I stopped with my boss on a recent business trip and the service was the best I have ever had a fast food place. This is brand new and everything is nice and clean."}
{"text":"The best fast food chain. Period. Great tasting food. Wonderful people. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"It's Good, it's clean and the service just plain amazing for a fast food joint! My favorite item off the menu is the grilled chicken garden salad. Second fav is the spicy chicken sandwich. I'm addicted to the waffle fries. They actually taste like a potato! I know, crazy huh? 
 My kids love it, I like it so here we are."}
{"text":"Just ok for me, I think this place was hyped up by my American cousin.

YES, the customer service is definitely upbeat, friendly, & efficient, but the sandwich tasted like a better version of KFC.  Chicken wasn't as battered and it was moist.  Absolutely zero sauce on the bun and when I attempted to put some CFA sauce on it, my cousin said that it's supposed to be plain.  Bun just tasted buttered.  

Waffle fries were on the greasy side and overrated.  CFA sauce which you're supposed to dip fries into tasted mayo-based, on the sweet side, and with a smoked Chipotle flavour to it.

Cobb Salad was very good, but I'm thinking that it's not as healthy as it can be due to the Avocado Lime dressing...which was quite tasty!

Again, this place wasn't bad, it just didn't blow my mind or reinvent the wheel.  Perhaps I'm biased because I seldom eat fast food."}
{"text":"Food was good terrible service however. Was given attitude when I asked for extra napkins and then they only gave me 3 napkins total."}
{"text":"My first chick-fil-a ever! I guess I tried this out of curiosity. Really love their coleslaw and at times, I'd even get their chicken in addition to some other take-out lunch."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is Chick-Fil-A deficient. It was guaranteed that when we visited Phoenix that we were going to catch Chick-Fil-A's act.

  When we had to park in the adjacent shopping center because the parking lot was full, it was an omen that we were going to eat in a four star fast food restaurant.

  Chick-Fil-A is a four star restaurant specializing in everything chicken. Their chicken nuggets and chicken sandwiches are at the top of the fast food chicken totem pole. Unlike many McDonald's you can serve yourself to the chicken sauces. There is none of that \"25 cents for a third sauce\" stuff. It is not just the chicken. Chick-Fil-A also serves delicious waffle fries.

  Leaving Chick-Fil-A, the same thought hit me when I left their Chicago location, \"Why don't they open a restaurant in Las Vegas?\""}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A Mania has landed in the Las Vegas Valley in the shadow of Sunset Station. Only a couple of weeks after two of the first Las Vegas Valley stores opened, Chick-fil-A Mania has no intention of calming down. When I visited Chick-fil-A this Friday around 2 pm, I expected Chick-fil-A Mania to have slightly faded. 

   I have been a fan of Chick-fil-A for years. Just like so many of my neighbors in the Las Vegas Valley, I was looking forward to the day that Chick-fil-A would arrive here. I would have to visit St. George, Utah or be on vacation somewhere to satisfy my Chick-fil-A craving. Because Yelp is my diary, my last record of a Chick-fil-A visit was the Yelp review I recorded on a couple (not one) visits to a Chicago Loop Chick-fil-A. And because Yelp is my Diary, I have to speak the truth. And the truth is that I expected better from the one of the two first Chick-fil-A's in the Las Vegas area. I'll discuss this soon. 

  Chick-fil-A was remarkably busy to the degree that there were several accessory employees helping with functions including traffic control, order taking at the door, refilling beverages inside, and cashiering. I parked a few office buildings away. 

  In contrast to the friendly employees at previous employees, the woman at door (I believe her name was Chloran) gave a negative first impression. Right off the bat she expected me to know what I was ordering. No smiles. No \"Welcome to Chick-fil-A.\" And no menu. How do I know what to order minus a menu? Fortunately I recalled the chicken nuggets meal. Accordingly I ordered the 12 piece chicken nuggets meal. Subsequently I gave her my name which she put in the computer pad. From here I waited on the line that moved fast. Upon ordering I gave my name and $8.64 for the 12 piece chicken Nugget meal. They gave me a few packets of sauce and something to identify me when they called \"Daniel\" and brought my food and beverage. The name system would be another problem considering Daniel is a common name. They would be calling Daniel for more than one order. 

  Unexpectedly there were a few available tables. And unexpectedly the chicken nuggets were not the gems I remember from past visits. Out of 12 nuggets a handful were more like bites or you could say large crumbs. They were so small that I only used up one packet of sauce dipping them. If I did not vividly remember the Chick-fil-A visits of the past, I would say it is overrated. Now the waffle fries were exceptionally good. I will go on to say that Chick-fil-A and Nathan's are my favorite fries in the fast food industry. I will go on to say that the portion was so underwhelming that I spent an abbreviated time in Chick-fil-A Mania. In that time I experienced friendlier employees than the one at the door. They refilled my beverage, brought ketchup to the table, and asked how everything is. 

   I am happy that Chick-fil-A now shared the same area code as me. However, I plan to delay my visits until Chick-fil-A Mania dies down."}
{"text":"Love the food and fast service every time I go! It was even raining today & I saw the manager outside sweeping and cleaning the parking lot!"}
{"text":"So today I went through the drive thru and ordered a meal for my family. My mom who has Celiac so I make sure I make sure they understand her allergy and that everything needs bag separately. I told the guy who placed the order my first part of the order is a gluten allergy then the rest of the order is not he confirmed it. So he repeated the order and everything sounded correct I pay and grab my food and drive home 15 mins away. I go to eat my chicken BBQ sandwich and there is no bun they made the entire order gluten free. I call the restaurant while headed back and explain the situation and ask that they remake my entire meal because at this point I'm not eating a hour old fries by the time I get back home they First Lady explained that she's not replacing the fries and I asked if she was the manager she said umm I do the fundraising and something else I then asked again so are you a manager or not it took her awhile for her to state she was a manager but then put me on hold with out asking to place me on hold then someone else picks up the phone and asks how they can help me Jackie was the 2nd managers name so before I can explain the story she tells me they shouldn't replace my sandwich because I confirmed the order again at no time did they say sandwich without a bun when confirming and then tells me she won't replace my fries I then ask if their is a DM and she stated no just corporate so I asked again why wouldn't they replace my meal since they messed it up her response was it's not our fault you didn't pay attention (again never stated they were making entire order gluten free especially when I explained that only a portion was) then she said oh well you could've eaten your fries (um no I eat my meal as a meal so no I can't and why are you dictating what or how I'm gonna eat my food) so I asked for the corporate number again she couldn't hear me and thought I hung up as I heard her talking about me saying oh she asked for the number and hung up on me heard her dial my number again then she tried to say I hung up and she called me back when clearly I didn't hang up asked for a refund of my entire meal because at this point I was done with her rudeness and she stated go ahead and call corporate we don't give refunds. I told her how horrible her customer service was and she stated that's funny your the only one who thinks so when clearly based off the comments the mangers are rude. Waiting on the store to contact me per corporate and it better not be either one of the ones I spoke with. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!! Rude attitudes. Didn't get my order correct. Charge me $.20 for their mistake."}
{"text":"This place is always busy with lines wrapped around the place. Took about 40 minutes to order and get our food. The workers and their friendliness makes up for the long wait."}
{"text":"You know, if I look back on it I haven't had a Chick-fil-A experience I didn't like. This is my choice location and it's like the diamond in the rough surrounded by mostly par and sub-par restaurants in this area.

Chick-fil-A has certainly weathered the storm when it comes to the fall of fast food these days. Yeah, their food is still fast and relatively similar to the rest in that it's fried, greasy and fattening. But they've added a few other options to their menu. There's of course your generic fresh fruit cup but they now have a few kinds of soup which are quite good in my opinion. Additionally, in case it wasn't advertised enough already, they've got grilled chicken alternatives for just about every fried chicken menu item. You may have misgivings about eating grilled chicken here but I swear to you: it's good. I'm also a huge fan of their cookies & cream milkshake. And let's face it, who isn't a fan of their fresh squeezed delectable lemonade?

The food is good and everyone knows it. But the service? It's above and beyond anything we've come to know for fast food. You will always ALWAYS have a pleasant experience at any Chick-fil-A. If you don't, call them or e-mail them to say so and they will absolutely make it right. This location is no exception. You won't leave here feeling bothered, frustrated, worried about spit in your meal or pissed off in general. In fact you should almost always leave here exactly the opposite: practically uplifted. The prices may be only a thin hair higher than those of competitor fast food chains but for the level of service I'd choose Chick-fil-A any day. Now I just need some places like Wendy's or Cook Out to hop on the stellar service bandwagon so I can get the other things I love to eat without feeling like all is lost for humanity."}
{"text":"This will now be my new go-to Chick-fil-A on account of it being scary-close to home and work. Nothing special going on here - the usual CFA things. I like that they constantly add new things to their menu to keep up with the ever changing dietary demands of Americans.

In the morning the drive-thru line gets long; step inside and there's zero wait. Service wise they certainly don't hold up to the experience you'll have at the one up in Mooresville (it has more of that southern charm). Nonetheless, you will still get the standard higher quality of customer service here when compared to ANY other fast food joint."}
{"text":"This is my most convenient Chick-fil-A. Plus the one over on South Blvd can be a pain most of the time. Here they reflect the standard level of service found at any location. A flood of \"My pleasure!\" in response to every \"thank you\" from a customer.

Valentine's Day led to a heart shaped container of 30 piece nuggets that I could not finish. This is also in conjunction with the Feed the Children charity where they donate a portion of your purchase. As long as you don't generate food waste in the process I guess it's a good thing.

Chick-fil-A is pricey but you always get the quality and service you pay for. Plus if you get the app you can build up loyalty points for freebies."}
{"text":"We've lived in Surprise for 8 years and we are always going to this Chick-fil-A! We love it and they've always been great to us!"}
{"text":"My official favorite fastfood place! They had your name and what you wear wrote done on the order. So you can just sit down and relax, the food will come to you. The servers ware sooo nice and professional! The chicken was very crispy and tender!"}
{"text":"Eaten here multiple times. This is a very small high volume store. They provide exceptional quickness with orders and accuracy in consideration of how busy they are. Have eaten here multiple times and never had any issues."}
{"text":"This review, if I can be specific, is relative to the overall \"quick service\" industry - the more posh term for fast food. Relative to other competitors in the market, I'm finding Chick-fil-A, specifically this location, to be a stand out. The service is always top notch, the restaurant clean and kept up, and the food, much like the children in the fictitious town of Lake Wobegon, is above average. I've had their chicken breakfast biscuit before but the sausage biscuit is a real stand out as the sausage is amazing, and goes well with the biscuit - I prefer it with addition of egg and cheese as it is an amazing flavor combination. I enjoy the Sausage Egg McMuffin from McDonald's but this beats it, hands down. 

For those of us who prefer to use alternative forms of transportation there are two sets of bike racks on the front patio and an interesting fact, you get a code to get into the bathroom when you purchase something - a sign that the restaurant is working hard to play nice in an urban environment when they are right off of Mill Avenue.

I have to say, I wasn't overly excited about a Chick-fil-A in my area but they have won me over with the quality of their service and their breakfast food (I'm pretty much a breakfast only patron of the quick service industry). Interesting to note that as of 2012 Chick-fil-A has been the number one chicken chain in the United States."}
{"text":"Today was extremely busy at this location. The line was all the way out in the road. I was a little frustrated from my day when I came through the drive-through and when lady behind me honked her horn I definitely lost my temper. To say the least it's been a stressful day. The man who took my order outside was beyond nice, even when I didn't deserve it. When I got to the window Chick-fil-A through a \"random act of kindness\" (also known as you're clearly having a bad day let us do something nice for you)  gave me my meal for free. Even in a moment where I let my temper get the best of me these wonderful people managed to do something so extremely nice that it completely blew my mind. To the man who took my order, I am so sorry and I am embarrassed for my actions. You are a truly wonderful person! To the entire staff at this Chick-fil-A you guys deserve a medal for your kindness. I paid for the ladies meal behind me as a cheap \"I'm sorry\". I guess I'm saying all this the staff can know how far their kindness really went. I will definitely remember this. Thank you.."}
{"text":"The service is a top reason for stopping by, they always brighten your day and the food is always on point. Great establishment."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast items which is a plus for me. Drive thru is always quick. I love their lemonade and the sell it in take home jugs! They are closed on Sunday's though which is a bummer."}
{"text":"We normally have been big, big fans of Chik-fil-A.  I love the chicken sandwiches but my husband is normally not a big chicken eater.  However, he has always been a fan of Chick-fil-A's chicken noodle soup.  You know the one. It's the ones with the thick homemade-like noodles with the fairly clear delicious broth.  Well, all that has changed and I doubt I'll ever get my husband in another Chik-fil-A.  

The soup broth has changed and so have the noodles.  The yummy broth has gone away and been replaced with a \"healthier\" version that has very little taste.  The noodles have also been replaced.

We were so disappointed when we ordered that we asked one of the managers about the change.  Evidently corporate changed that recipe about six weeks ago.

We mentioned that we were unhappy with the change and that we didn't care for the new soup.  We were surprised that the person in charge did not offer a replacement.  The soup went in the trash."}
{"text":"You may not think that Chick-Fil-A could get any better than it usually is, but in this case, you would be wrong.  For it was at this very location, just over eight years ago, that I proposed to my wife (for those of you who have not had the pleasure of meeting her, she said yes).

That is correct.  I asked her to marry me over tasty chicken sandwiches during lunch.  No fancy trappings.  No trip to the beach or the mountains.  No special band or even a serenade from an over-the-hill pop star.  Even better is that I did not even have the ring.  Just a standard business lunch at a fast food restaurant when the moment seemed right.  And best of all, she had no clue.  She was so surprised that I nearly had to ask her twice.  Yet still she said yes.

As Barnabas Stinson would say, it was legend - wait for it - ary.

Okay, most of you probably will not propose at any Chick-Fil-A let alone this one, and for that reason, it is not going to get five stars from you.  For that matter, I doubt that I will ever do so again, so it might be pushing it for five stars from me.  But it is still a nice example of the chain, and well worth a visit.  Nothing really out of the ordinary, and as is my fashion, I suggest getting the fries well done, or they can come out a bit limp.  No one likes limp fries.

And just in case you are wondering, the ring did come along eventually.  She got it over breakfast at a bagel joint.  At least for that one I got down on one knee."}
{"text":"Lately I've noticed two things.

First, the friendliness of the staff at Chick-Fil-A has gone up exponentially.  I don't think it's just one store in particular, because it seems to be at all locations (or at least all of them we visit).  Second, the fries are tasting better.  It's not that the fries themselves are different, because they look or even really taste new, but they seem to be letting them cook longer, which leads to crispier fries, instead of those nasty limp waffle things that they used to put out.

Now I just need to make sure to remember to ask for \"well done\" fries just in case, and I think I can actually grow to like these Chick-Fil-A fries... I still don't really care for the spicy chicken, however.  I can let them slide on that as long as they offer hot sauce on the condiment bar and free chicken once a year, however."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A as a whole has great staff, but this location in particular has staff that go above and beyond.  I wish I could put my finger on it.  Most CFA locations are friendly... sometimes.  But if they get busy, it goes out the window (not the drive-through).

Now they are friendly and all at those other locations - but do they walk around and refill drinks or pick up trays and ask if you need anything?  Only if they are looking to keep busy.

At this store, it seems to happen all the time.  It could be at opening, at closing, even at the lunch rush.  There are employees out asking if you need any sauces, a refill or whatever - they are always out making sure you are taken care of at any time of day.  It is almost a full-service restaurant.

The only thing that could make it better is if they were a bit easier to get into and out of, but that is mostly the fault of the center, not CFA.  And if they were open on Sunday.  Why do I always want a Spicy Chicken Biscuit on Sunday?"}
{"text":"Not only does this Chick-Fil-A serve the standard fare that you can find at other CFAs that you know and love - and they do it with the same friendly service as well - they also have an excellent patio out on the side., next to the play area. Definitely worth a visit.

The only unfortunate thing is that you are in a parking lot, after all, but hey - at least you can sit in the shade while you partake in your awesomely fried chicken sandwich at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Already reviewed CFA.  This is about the long-awaited spicy chicken.  In a phrase, don't bother.  Listen, I love Chick-Fil-A (as if that isn't obvious by my svelte appearance).  And I even love having an extra bite to the classic sandwich.  But this one's a dud.

I have been a fan of the classic Chick-Fil-A for years.  Decades even.  I can hang with the chicken nuggets.  Or strips.  I can even eat a waffle fry or two.  Throw some salad under it and it'll work.  In a pinch I might even try a grilled version.  But this one?  Blech.

Look, I like spicy food.  Not knock-you-out-spicy, because I'm too old for that.  But a few drops of Texas Pete on top of the classic chicken?  Heck yeah.  That's a treat.  This monstrosity?  No way.  Why four stars?  Because the service is still great, and the original sandwich is well worth it, so I don't want to knock them for trying.

But take a look at the pictures - while there are bound to be variances, with regularity, the spicy sandwiches were thin, crusty versions of their thick juicy counterparts.

Even the buns were different.  Where the classic sandwich gave you a nice steamed bun that is just right, the spicy one just didn't.  It's like the outer shell of the sandwich dried out everything, and just took away all that is good and holy, which is a shame.

You want spicy chicken, go to Bojangles (or look for the hot sauce on the condiment bar).  This sandwich isn't worth the extra charge.  Stick with the original and you'll be good to go.

Sweet Tea Report:  Chick-Fil-A has one of the best-known sweet teas at a fast-food restaurant.  They even sell it by the gallon.  They may have been the first place to sell sweet tea by the gallon (to go, presumably, since you can get refills if you eat in).  I find their tea to generally be quite good, but it generally needs just a bit more sweet.  If it would make it over that hump it would be awesome.  Still, it will typically do in a pinch!"}
{"text":"I love some Chick-Fil-A.  I love the Randolph Road one even better, because it's customer appreciation week.  Who heard of an entire week of free stuff from a fast food restaurant?  That's awesome!  This morning was a free chicken biscuit, and there are other giveaways coming the rest of the week.

As to the food, it's standard CFA fare - their unique take on chicken, which is unequaled, even though McDonald's has tried with their \"Southern Style\" chicken that just doesn't quite make it.

The staff at this location has to be the friendliest I've ever met.  Even though I came in, had a water and the free biscuit, they were attentive to my every need.  Absolutely amazing how friendly that they were, and I was simply astounded.  Even when you buy stuff at other locations they aren't typically that friendly."}
{"text":"The Chick-Fil-A demonstrates, perhaps more than almost any other fast food joint, how one location can be completely different than another. Sure, the menu offers the same food as the other. But the service can vary completely from one to the next.

At this particular location, they are almost always slammed. That is unfortunate because they are right at the front of Stonecrest, so it can make getting into or out of the shopping center a challenge.

But even in that mad scramble, the service is solid. As has been mentioned, if the food from the kitchen comes out slowly, they will go that extra mile (or at least a couple of feet) and bring it out to your table. How do they know what table you choose? No idea. But they seem to do it, and it gives them that extra special touch."}
{"text":"There are plenty of places in Charlotte that have either challenging parking lots or can be difficult to get into.  This particular location has both.  I do not know if it was a mandate from the city, but because of the entrance of this location, it can be a real bear to get into the parking lot if you are headed in the wrong direction due to a cement barrier that attempts to make sure only those from one direction are allowed entry.

Attempts?  Yes, attempts.  There are people headed in the wrong direction who have decided that they need their fix and go for it anyway, and that just makes life difficult for everyone, but such is the world we live in.

Should you get inside, the actual restaurant is not bad, it is merely your mood due to having to navigate the entryway to the parking lot, and the relatively small lot itself - which is not really bad, just undersized."}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A.  I think I love them most when they provide free food.  Even their annual calendars give you regular helpings of food that is not quite free, but it is just about as close as you get - just $5 and you get food all year long, one month after the next.  Other than that, look for new product announcements (Spicy Chicken or new ketchup packets, to name but a few).

The CFA location at Concord Mills is not the simplest location to get into (and out of), but like most locations, they are very friendly and can even be spotted coming out to refill drinks - almost unheard of at any other fast food location.  You do have to catch them at a slow time, which is unusual in this area, since the mall is always slammed, but it is great when you can get it.

The verdict?  Eat Mor.  Now."}
{"text":"The drive thru was quick for a Saturday morning. Very thankful as I was on a short time frame. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with food choices. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love Chick-fil-a but a huge thank you to Robert an Anthony working the drive through this Saturday around noon! I appreciate your customer service and work ethic very much."}
{"text":"There are 2100+ CFA locations across the country. And this location is the 3rd to open in Vegas. As such it's just like most of the 2100 other locations in that a spicy deluxe chicken sandwich from this location is just the same as one in Amarillo, TX or Salt Lake City. 

Service is what I judge a CFA location on and this location does a great job at handling high volume drive-thru traffic. Wait times are short here in my experience. Also while other CFA locations in Vegas like the one on Stephanie in Henderson have serious problems with order accuracy this is one location that has not messed up my order. Not once. 

It can be a pain to get in and out of as it's located close to one of Vegas's most notorious intersections at I-15 and Sahara. But if you're craving some CFA, you can't go wrong stopping here. You'll get in and out fast, and at least in my experience you'll get friendly service without having to worry about your order getting messed up."}
{"text":"When an obsessed Chick-Fil-A fanatic starts dropping stars on a Chick-Fil-A review, it should become quite clear that there's a problem. The franchise owner of this Chick-Fil-A location certainly has a problem with his crew and that problem is with order accuracy. When one places an order and pays for it it is not unreasonable to expect that you will get every item you paid for. But at this CFA location on 5 of the past 6 visits has had problems with missing food items. It seems like 4 or 6 piece chicken nuggets or waffle fries are easy to forget, despite having multiple monitors by the drive thru window displaying the order to help the staff avoid this problem. 

And another pet peeve. When you order drinks to go please take a minute and put straws in the bag or make sure they make it out of the drive thru window. I love CFA's lemonade and sweet tea but drinking from a wide open cup in stop and go traffic is not something I like to do. I know the Vegas CFA's are doing some serious volume of business and the lines are still long. But taking a few more seconds to insure order accuracy and that everything is as it should be would be so nice. If the Eastern Ave. location can do it, there's no reason why the Stephanie St. location can't do it. FIX THE PROBLEMS!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location. While I love Chick-Fil-A, having been known to stop in for breakfast and lunch on the same day, and up to 9 visits per week on average, this is one of the locations I hate. Why? It's a pain to get in and out of it. Part of this is due to the City of Henderson not anticipating the traffic flow and not updating the traffic light on Eastern to improve access. And once you get to the lot it becomes very clear that little thought was put into managing the traffic overflow for the drive-thru. Getting in and out of this location is challenging. So much so that I will say it's the most difficult Chick-Fil-A location in 9 states that I've been to to get in and out. 

Another gripe is about the cleanliness inside. I know they just opened a month ago and are very busy, but when both my wife and I slipped on the wet greasy floor, that's a problem. And the bathrooms are quite frankly disgusting. So much so that I am tempted to complain to Corporate in Atlanta about it. I've been in Chick-Fil-A locations that see just as much volume and have not experienced these problems anywhere else. 

If you're craving Chick-Fil-A, I would HIGHLY suggest trying one of their other locations in the valley and steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"I really love chick fil a 's chicken cold wraps and their classic chicken sandwich. Their avocado ranch dressing is delicious! At first I was thrown off because it was green/avocado and I'm typically not a fan but I love it. Their waffle fries are amazing also. I also am a fan of their service with this being a fast food restaurant I really appreciate when they bring your food to the table. This is so nice when I have my hands full with my boys."}
{"text":"One thing I like the most about chick fil a is their food is always hot. My chicken sandwich was so juicy I don't know how they do it. I also love their waffle fries. It's not super expensive but more expensive than other fast food. However it is worth it. This particular location is always busy and their parking lot is crowded but there is more parking just need to walk a little."}
{"text":"I love the chicken cold wrap and avocado ranch dressing at Chick-fil-A. And their waffle fries are always good. However today a little more salty than usual. We like to eat here because the food is good but also they have a nice play place that my son enjoys to play in. My husband and son went to the bathroom and the floor right before entering was really wet and slippery. This made their shoes slippy until we left. 
This issue was addressed by the management at this location and they are going to try out new floor cleaner. I would say that is pretty awesome on their part that they actually pay attention to reviews and want to make customers experiences as good as they can."}
{"text":"Easy to get in and out of. I went through drive through for my order and it was a breeze!! My order was correct as always and I was happy that I was out of there in a few mins. Great location."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant but slow service. I came here around 10am and they were still pretty but with the drive thru but the line was taking forever. I got the hashbrowns and they were good but greasy. Another, flaw is that they forgot to give me napkins and ketchup. Meh."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food. My order has always been accurate and the staff is really friendly. When I'm at the drive-thru, I always get my food quick when it's my turn at the window. They can be really busy in the mornings but the wait isn't usually that long."}
{"text":"I came here at 1130 for lunch and they were already packed. I went to the drive thru and it ran by smoothly. I got my order and was on my way. Service is always good and my meal was delicious."}
{"text":"This location is insanely busy no matter what time it is! I came here at 11am and the line was out the road. I was already stuck so I might as well just stayed. I went to the drive thru and really didn't wait that long. At the drive thru window there is someone outside taking your payment and handing your food. It's honestly a quick way to get in an out. I got all my condiments and my order was correct. I really can't complain!"}
{"text":"I came here and went to the drive thru. They have two lanes to order. That might not be the best idea. Both lanes were clogged into forming into one lane to where people were stuck and couldn't even order. When it was my turn to get my food service was slow even when they were greeting me at the window. Next time I might try to go in if necessary."}
{"text":"Great location, very clean, super fast... We love chickfila since most of them are very consistent in the food, drinks etc..."}
{"text":"Having grown up around Chick-Fil-A it was maddening living in Vegas all these years and not having one locally. I surely didn't mind the drive to St. George as it also meant an excuse to go to Zion National Park after, but having one here locally is excellent! At first I was worried that a location next to the strip would be overly packed but since our wasn't too far from my work I wanted to give this one a whirl. 

I was immediately pleasantly surprised at how ample the parking was compared to the other two locations in town, it was so easy to find a spot! Walking in the door I was immediately greeted by a friendly employee who took my order while I waited in line to get to the register. That meant simply walking up with my drink waiting for me and just having to tap my phone to pay. The staff was beyond courteous, the food was fresh, hit, and delicious as one would expect from Chick Fil A, and the dining room was very clean and looked extremely nice. I got a great smile out of the painting of the strip bathed in Chick Fil A signs and logos. 

This will easily be my go to spot for Chick Fil A and I'm glad it's finally here!"}
{"text":"White people food, lol aka ass not tryna be racist I love all my whiteys but dam not for my Latinos/Hispanics lol"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I always get the chicken sandwiches with Colby cheese. Even when it gets busy they have plenty of workers to keep the line moving. Very affordable prices and quality is way better than the usual fast food places. Ask for the Chik Fil A sauce. It goes great with the burger and fries. I don't recommend the grilled chicken sandwich though. I thought it was not as flavorful as the fried chicken sandwich and a little to charred for me. All in all, great customer service, quality fast food, and very reasonable prices. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This location is no better or worse then all the other locations I've been too. They are all friendly, polite and the waffle fries are sometimes half done. You can almost expect half done waffle fries when they are busy which is pretty much all the dang time. When they are cooked right...... UMMMM UMMMM UMMMM!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! The drive thru service has really improved here. (It was never terrible but just lacking A little) I haven't been in a while and almost passed the other day because of the line for drive thru (all fresh and still did not take long). Props to the girl outside taking orders she managed to still smile in this 10 mill degree weather. I felt so happy when I asked for extra honey mustard and the girl at the window who greeted me with a smile and by name reassured me the extra sauce was in there without me asking really made my experience beyond average especially because I always check to make sure all is there. (it's the best honey mustard I've had and normally when I ask I would get a hesitant yes and somehow still not get in my bag so this really made it for me!)"}
{"text":"After 2 weeks of waiting for the lines to go away, I decided to try the food at  Chik-Fil-A on Eastern in Henderson. I had to see what the hype was about, and after getting my food, I am still wondering. I ordered a chicken sandwich combo meal with waffle fries and sweet tea. The wet and mushy breading on the sandwich was not appealing to me, but the meat was okay. I have had better. Waffle fries were great. The sweet tea did not have enough flavor, I like to taste the tea notes along with the sweetness, it was to watery for me. Since this was a first visit, I will try something different next time. I usually like to eat healthy, but when I do want fried chicken, I go to Cane's, and loved them from the first bite."}
{"text":"Bummed to only be giving one of my favorite fast-food restaurants in America 3 stars! 

Popped in for breakfast & really wanted the bagle breakfast sandwich but with grilled chicken instead of fried- \"we don't substitute for that..wait, what? Y'all literally have a grilled chicken breakfast sandwich so that doesn't make any sense...what's really going on back there?! 
Whatever, I got over it & ordered the sandwich as is..fried. 
Was so excited to finally get the frosted lemonade (since it's all new to LV), I ask if it's too early & she says \"no we do it early but our machine is down so you would need to wait for a while in the parking lot for it\".. 
Ummm, ok..so that's a no. 

I know they're better than this & the employee was far from charming..typically when I travel I get outstanding customer service from Chick-fil-a, in fact I've never had a bad experience. 
Of course I'll be back (probably the other location) but of course I had to Yelp about it!"}
{"text":"Went through drive-thru with about 20 people waiting.  Got my food in about 10 min....and it was hot!! Came back a second time with the same situation and same service! Great workers here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yet another visit to Chick Fil A in Surprise AZ has me scratching my head and wondering why I keep trying to get the items I order and pay for at this location. I suppose it's the dim memory of their success when I first moved to Surprise six years ago, when the employees were happy, helpful and proud of their product. 

Well, those days are long gone and every single visit is guaranteed to upset me, picky guest that I am. My diction is clear and I don't have a mouthful of marbles, but here are just a few of my last order problems at this location. 

Ordered fries with no salt. Got salty fries. Pretty much every time. 

Ordered iced tea unsweetened. Got lukewarm tea with no ice. Twice in the last week!

Ordered iced tea with 10% diet lemonade. Got 90% regular lemonade which sent my blood sugar to triple its normal level. 

Ordered waffle fries with no salt. Got hash brown pellets coated in salt. 

Ordered chicken wrap. No chicken in it. 

Attempted to redeem free sandwich coupon in drive thru. Was told it was only for guests who came in. Thanks, I am disabled and can't just stroll in with my oxygen and walker. 

Ordered 2 chicken strips for my cat. Got one. He was quite disappointed. 

And the saga continues. Truth is, I have no idea why I bother here, why I call the restaurant to report in, or why I let the managers know if there's a problem. The disdain and disinterest on their faces is crystal clear. So perhaps this round up is for the other guests who come here and cannot quite believe it, either. 

There are so many other Chicks in the West Valley...please don't waste your time and energy hoping for a miracle in Surprise. We deserve better!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, quick service, even when the line is miles long. Orders are always accurate and the staff is always kind. The bathrooms are clean, and the seating area is clean. The staff will come around to check on you  get you more to drink , etc. A step up from traditional fast food."}
{"text":"I grew up on this place in Los Angeles. I was there the first day to see all the hipe and it brought back so many memory's of my childhood. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"I've dined in twice.  My food arrived at the table immediately after I sat down the first time, and it beat me to the table today.  My food is sitting in front of me getting cold as I type this.  That is how blown away I am at the difference between this and most other fast food chains.  By the way, the place is packed.  Every other aspect is great as well, but the speed is really incredible."}
{"text":"This place is rockin'. Serving food fast, hot and with a smile. And it is good. Hard to give 4 to fast food, but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. The staff is so kind. The food is great. The music is subtle but catchy. Everything about this location is enjoyable. The highlight though, Deb. She is great. She is helpful. She is chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A! Can't wait for the Reno store to open until then I'll just be happy with having my Chick-fil-A in Mesa. Grabbed the chicken strip meal with the tasty waffle fries, extra Chick-fil-A sauce, and a refreshing lemonade. Perfect lunch for a day that's already 104° in the shade! They are, of course, quite busy at lunchtime and their parking lot takes a little bit of patients to maneuver through as you come out of the drive-through, but hey it's Chick-fil-A and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is over rated. The chicken was not all that great and pretty salty. I ordered an 8 piece chicken nugget and I couldn't believe what I was seeing... The nuggets are so small and I was still hungry after I finished my meal."}
{"text":"Thank goodness there is now a Chil-Fil-A in Vegas! The line stretches all the way to the freeway but employees are here pushing out food almost as fast as In-N-Out. 

Keep your receipt to get a free chicken sandwhich on your next visit!"}
{"text":"Super quick service, gets very busy around lunch time. Clean restaurant, outside seating available. Well managed for a fast food joint"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place!  It was great!  The food was excellent and the prices are reasonable. My boyfriend commented how good the ice cream looked when we were in line, and an employee gave us free cones on the way out. It was really worth the long line."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love This place! The food was awesome as always. The service was friendly and very quick. They keep the place very clean. One of my favorite quick stops to grab food."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here as always with chick-fil-a. The staff was so nice and welcome. I noticed they all say, \"it was my pleasure\". Super polite. Food came out quickly. The Food was delicious. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru but had to get out of my car because they put fried chicken on my Cobb salad instead of the grilled chicken substitute I requested. Upon entering, I didn't have to say a word. The manager saw me and quickly apologized and asked how the order was wrong. I explained and they had it out luckily split apologizing the whole time. I love chick fil a because of their service. The food is good but the service is great. I will definitely be coming back to this location. My salad was so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Used the mobile app on my way to the reaturaunt and my order was ready for pick up as soon as I stepped in! I have also used this location for catering for work events and the catering manager is so kind and great to work with. Like most chik fil a locations they are especially fast and courteous. I wish more fast food chains gave this kind of customer service."}
{"text":"This location is one of the prettier ones I have seen. It looks like it was designed by Joanna Gaines from the HGTV show \"Fixer Upper\". The staff are super friendly and serve you as if you were in a 5 star restaurant. It is clean and presentable and there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Their sausage & egg biscuits are awesome! Need to work on their chick fil a sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food at this Chick-fil-A location is just awful. Service was fast, but the quality of the food and service was far and away worse than any other location I've been to, and honestly just bad by fast food standards"}
{"text":"Never fails to satisfy my cravings!! I love chick-fil-A! My favorite fast food place to get some good chicken sandwiches. And I loooveeee their fries w/ their signature sauce!! Yum."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love their nuggets!  I love Chick Fil A nuggets.  I usually go get a quick order during lunch. It's faster to go inside than the drive through.  The staff is always friendly and says \"Hi\" or \"Welcome\".  The dining area is always clean and always full during lunchtime."}
{"text":"Came here tonight real quick for some nuggets and an ice cream cone. 
The line was crazy. In the driveway

So i walked inside. 
It was busy. 
My girlfriend got a sandwich. We got it pretty quickly"}
{"text":"Let me just say that no other fast food restaurant comes near Chick Fil A when it comes to customer service. Ask anything and they say \"My pleasure\". If you have to wait for your food they give you a coupon for a free sandwich. (You rarely wait). Their food is consistently hot and fresh. If you are not satisfied for any reason they will fix it and make sure you are happy. 
They have great family nights and events like tonight where if you wear Pirate gear you get a free chicken sandwich. 
The restaurant is always clean and they usually have someone who will come to your table to get you refills or take your garbage. They are all about detail including fresh flowers on your table. Well Done Chick Fil A!"}
{"text":"Four words-chicken nuggets & waffle fries. Yum!!!  Chick Fil A has THE best chicken nuggets. They are REAL pieces of chicken. They aren't minced chicken formed into \"nuggets\". They have lots of dipping sauces to choose from-Buffalo, Ranch, and BBQ to name a few. The Chick Fil A sauce is my favorite. And no one else has waffle fries!  Of course a milkshake makes it a great trio!  I also like their chicken wraps and chicken soup. 
The customer service is outstanding and the restaurant is always clean. It's very kid friendly and there is a play place for them. They even have someone who comes around asking if you need refills and taking your trash. No other fast food place I know of does that."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at chick fil a but I literally had the rudest cashier she didn't thank me for my business. Drive through needs a little help"}
{"text":"Chik-Fil-A = good chicken, good service.

You don';t have to pay a management consultant to tell you why this place is packed and successfull.  McD, KFC and all them other place, needs to come here and take a look.

This place does very simple things to make the entire experience good. 

Like every CFA , the lunch crowd descends upon the drive thru, and this place is smart enough to have 2 workers come outside and take orders.  Thus shortening the line and expediting the delivery of food.  Simple, helpful and profitable.."}
{"text":"Placed a mobile order on 10/27 at 7:04am at 7:25am I had to go in and cancel my order because I was going to be late for work. Was told they \"had a late start\". Ps not my problem. At that time the manager was going to give me a refund back to the mobile app. A week later still no refund.  I call the store on Thursday spoke to the \"manager\" at around 9:00am for her to tell me she couldn't locate the transaction and needed to talk to the area or regional manager.  She then took my phone number and said I'll call you back shortly. So as of today guess who didn't get a call back nor my refund. Now I'm pissed and this needs to be fixed ASAP. I will post a daily negative review until this matter is resolved.  Oh forget to mention my order was only 2 hash browns and the free breakfast sandwich totaling a whopping $2.49 cent refund. Now it's a matter of the principle which clearly they have NONE."}
{"text":"O-Fucking-Kay. bro check it, so I me being the great student I am is getting my teacher food, Bc why the fuck not. so I go to Chick-fil-A, her favorite, and I get inside not really a long wait. My turn to order. I won't forget this name ever. Brian Scott. Bro idk wtf happened to you but if I catch you in the streets don't be lackin. I do my teachers order (no problem.) then my order. I order fries and a drink. This is where he is SUPPOSED TO ASK ME \"what would you like to drink?\" THIS IS WHAT THIS BALD HEADED GUY SAYS \"do you want me to read your mind?\" I'm in my head like I'm bout to file on this nigga I didn't even want the fucking drink no more and my fries were hot but hard so that's why y'all got that extra start. Fuck y'all. It's sad how y'all set yourself on being the best and being so high and mighty but hire shit people."}
{"text":"So you know a young boy just got out of his college tour and hungry than 2 fat hungry b****** and I look at my bro like you tryna get chick-fil-a my guy?  He like yo I was just bout to ask you that direct me son, I look and pause and say \"..... Say less bro\" so we pull up on a Saturday, it was probably about 90 people in there so we wait the line is touching the kids place so I'm like ight this s*** going to take forever, took 2 min to get thru the line, 30 sec to order and after he was done filling up my drink up they had my order ready. Would've been Five Stars if you ain't drop my mans drink and didn't skimp him wit da chick-fil-a sauce son."}
{"text":"Color me disappointed. I ordered the 12 piece meal- first where is the chicken??? Oh... I forgot they are called \"nuggets\" they are meaty but seem on the salty side to me. 
They are super tiny. The waffle fries make up for lack of chicken kind of

I like the fact that they have A LOT of staff, they are all cheerful and attentive- I like the fact that they seem very well trained to keep people on the move and rung up quickly!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is. Food is ok. I got better chicken tenders and strips at KFC and Buschs chicken. Chicken was half done with batter. Not impressed. Only went there due to co workers going."}
{"text":"-Fast service! Drive-thru line moves quickly.

-Consistantly friendly service.

-Delicious for being fast food! The quality is way better than Taco Bell or McDonald's.

-Dipping sauces are surprisingly very good for being fast food.

-Love the cole slaw and the waffle fries!

-This is located in the Lowe's Shopping Center at the SW CORNER of Dysart & McDowell. CLOSED on SUNDAYS."}
{"text":"It's always nice to find a taste of the South when you're stuck up north. The woman and I went during this location's first week and not shockingly it was incredibly busy and a bit slower than I'm accustomed to at a CFA. I'm sure that given time they'll work out all the kinks. Food came out just as it should be so no complaints there."}
{"text":"We frequent this location and it's always clean, the staff is friendly and the food is always fresh and great!
We definitely recommend to anyone that's looking for a delicious quick meal.  Definitely a favorite"}
{"text":"Love this place. People who work here are super nice and of course yummy sandwiches! Also the drive-thru is super fast. Wish there are more Chick-fil-A places around the valley"}
{"text":"Can't find the yelp for the location on West Peoria Ave. Perhaps this location is too new? Anyway, I was driving by it on my way to the new Starbucks this morning with work to do and a desire for a tasty breakfast. Starbucks use to have a big giant table I could lay my stuff out on and spend time working and getting a caffeine buzz. But they moved up the street and it's smaller. And I've had problems with the internet. 
Now my review of Chik-Fil-A on Peoria. Fantastic! They have breakfast! Service was perfect! A big huge table with comfy stools and outlets! Really fast wifi! Noticeably fast! I had the chicken and egg on a bagel and loved it! Screw Starbucks....I'm eating chicken for breakfast while doing my morning work from now on!"}
{"text":"Tiah helped me in the drive through today. She was quick, polite, knowledgeable and overall a model employee. Food was super delicious and hit the spot."}
{"text":"OK...so I am not say that Chick-fil-A is as good as it gets as far as restaurants is concerned...but they are as good as it gets when it comes to fast food. I don't think anyone provides the combination of healthy and junk food. Desserts and entrees...when it comes to fast food. Of course there is also the fact that they just do great chicken and have fun commercials. This location was clean, friendly and fast...as in fast food."}
{"text":"Agree with all the negative reviews. Sad to say but the grilled chicken sandwich is bad and management is even worse. The entire operation is a disaster. Whoever hired these managers is not getting their money's worth.

No mayo or anything on the bland chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Exactly what you expect when visiting a CFA. Clean, cheery, fast, and accurate. I once saw a woman who went through the drive through approach the counter inside and just about yell at an employee. The employee took it like a champ and comped the meal for the crazy lady because, from what I could tell, that was her motive for yelling even though it seemed like she was just bonkers and the order was correct - she was mad they didn't give her enough napkins or something..

Anyway the only fault I have ever found with this location is that they printed the wrong version of \"there\" on their receipt."}
{"text":"This location is always busy during lunch but they are well staffed and friendly. The wait time is standard for a CFA and they are on par with other CFAs in the area."}
{"text":"They advertise that their drive through is the fastest in AZ, and I believe it! The parking lot here is a nightmare though, and people will cut the drive through line because there is a split for parking lot traffic to pass through - the people who do this either can't read or are complete jerks, I'm guessing it's the latter. Anyway, the restaurant gets my mobile order right 99% of the time, but usually forget the honey that I request. Still five star food and service."}
{"text":"I think most of us know Chick-fil-A! Politics aside, we crave it on occasion and probably more often than we should. This franchise is as good as most of the others I've been to. Menu is never over bearing and easy to read, so that's always a good thing. The location is convenient within a shopping center and close to a Target and I-485. We shop here often, so that's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Nice experience, the crew was very nice. Food was good, store was clean and the service was Awesome...the kids working here were great."}
{"text":"I've always thought of Chick-Fila to have good customer service. However, no matter what you will always find a BAD STORE. The Chick Fila at the ARBORETUM LOCATION has horrible management which they make mistake with your order and don't even have enough courtesy to fix it. This is one location that's so busy they really don't care if a person comes back because they have so much business, anyway. It's shame that you speak to the general manager and she wouldn't resolve the issue. I contacted the CORPORATE OFFICE and still didn't hear anything back. I guess I will have to speak to the OWNER about getting a replacement sandwich to the combo they messed up. I ordered a combo they made a mistake and gave me the wrong sandwich. I was on break I did not have time to go back that day. Therefore I addressed it the next day they refused to fix it. I was willing to pay for the fries and drink all I wanted is them to replace the sandwich they messed up. Bad customer service they just do not care at this location. I've never had such a bad experience at any other location beside this one. I notice good reviews makes me wonder if they singled me out & refused to help me? I have an issue with this because now I'm starting to realize everyone else is taken care at this location and not me. I have a problem with this its not about the food. I don't have to eat here, haven't been back since. It's about the principle there is no way you make mistake as a company and refuse to fix it. Looking at these other reviews it appears I've been singled out and will be reporting this incident."}
{"text":"I'm gonna echo Dana's review here and say that it is really weird to review a fast food place, especially such a well-known one, but I've gotta give it to them, they've got good service.

The staff are always really friendly (sometimes overbearingly so), and the whole place is just family friendly in general.  They've still got those playgrounds that the Burger Kings of the '90s used to have (yeah, I used to love those...), they've got events going on every Tuesday night I think?  Just like family games and stuff.  It's not something that you'd expect at all from a business, but I don't even have kids and I think it's a really nice gesture.  The place is pretty clean and if you sign up for their text updates, they have freebies on certain days, but they're generally in the mornings, so I guess the early birds do get the worm.

Do I really need to review the food?  Everyone's had Chick-fil-A at some point right?  Yummy chicken, yummy salads.  Wish they hadn't gotten rid of that carrot and raisin side salad, but they did.  Waffle fries are the best, especially with the variety of sauces you get to choose from.  Anywho, like the cows say, eat more chikin!"}
{"text":"the nuggets are my go to! i've always been a fan of the zesty buffalo sauce but today i tried the chick fil a sauce and it's super tasty and it topped the buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"Very horrible service, chicken wasn't all that good. I always hear people talking about chick-fil-a say it's good but my experience wasn't so great I'll never come here again. The chicken and fries had no flavor and were pretty cold, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday for lunch, And sorry we did... We placed out order and found a table. 10..15...20....25 Minutes go by and no food. The Bus boy / Food runner stops by and ask what the name on our order was. He then comes back and offers us Shakes for our wait. (which we gladly accepted) 10 Min later her brings us our food with a 1/2 Dozen cookies... ( A FOOD RUNNER... WHILE ALL 3 MANAGERS are standing at the counter) Not once did one stop by, ask or give an apology... 

So I thank the food runner for stepping up and taking care of us. But what a poor showing of Management...."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I could eat there everyday... The staff is very friendly and always makes sure you are satisfied.
P.s: notice that employees can't say \"your welcome\" instead they say \" my pleasure \". Lol"}
{"text":"I love this Chick-Fil-A! It is always clean and inviting. The employees are very friendly and genuinely seem happy to work here. We've attended their family craft nights-- Daisy Bunny at Easter and Fathers Day card making (free meal for fathers!). They are always sending us free offers through the app. And for awhile, they had free breakfast every Tue morning! Our 2 year old toddler loves playing in the play area which is the perfect size for her. So glad this is in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I always this chain. This one always has quick service, great food and very friendly. This time someone even stopped by our table to see if we needed anything else. Now why the 4 stars.....there were people standing around with trays of food as there was no place to sit. The parking is always 95-100% full and Ive had to park over at the mall a few times. They need more of these in Madison. Update: when does the new Chick-fil-A open on East Washington St, near Toppers?"}
{"text":"I used to go to the west side Chic fil A until this opened. I was here the day it opened and have been here at least 50times. Service is usually quick, they are always friendly, the food is always hot , freshly cooked and the sauce selection is extensive and they all taste nice. Some employees even come around asking if you would like a refill. Even though its been extremely busy Ive always found a place to sit. There is plenty of parking unless someone pulls up with a trailer and takes up 10 spots. 

Ive been through the drive thru several times and that moves quick. 
 

There is a children's play area and that keeps the little ones busy. 

This would be my favorite fast food chain by far BUT only gets 4 stars as they are not open Sundays. I understand a few reasons for businesses to stay closed on Sundays but if everywhere was closed and you're travelling or out nobody would eat."}
{"text":"I wanted to see what the big deal was and finally decided to give this place a try. I am not disappointed in the least. The shakes are yummy, and their Sriracha spicy chicken sandwich is delicious. Their fries could use some work though since they're floppy and not crisp but they're still very tasty."}
{"text":"First time eating Chick-fil-a. Though there was quite a line for drive thru, the line went by very fast. Similar to In-n-out, they have people taking orders outside to make the line go faster. Pretty efficient. 

We ordered a spicy chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets, and the waffle fries. Also got the chick-fil-a sauce.

The spicy chicken sandwich was surprisingly good. The chicken was very crispy on the outside, crispier than the nuggets. The chicken itself was tender and moist. It is just a tad spicy but I do feel like it could use some sauce so I added some chick-fil-a sauce which worked
with it too so regardless, probably the best chicken sandwich I've had. Would recommend. 

The nuggets, like the chicken in the chicken sandwich, was crispy on the outside and tender inside. However while it wasn't as crispy as the sandwich, it was still good. 

Even though I don't really eat fries, these were delicious. It came piping hot. It's lightly salted, is crisp on the outside yet soft inside. I think the waffle cut is cool too. 

They also have grilled chicken options for a healthier alternative which I might try in the future. 

Overall, would definitely visit their other locations in the future."}
{"text":"Though the young staff was friendly, I found the food too salty and unappealing. They also left out a sandwich which they promised to replace but they refused to when I came back. Won't ever come back"}
{"text":"For fast food Chick-Fil-A is awesome. I never feel over guilty when I eat it and it helps that it is across the street from my office... Or maybe it doesn't help because I go here more than I care to admit. Here are a few reasons why:

-The ice tea is fresh brewed and delicious
-The grilled market salad is only 330 calories (with dressing) and has fresh fruit and nuts and on top with grilled chicken
-The 8 count nuggets are only 270 calories (don't' think about the fat) and so darn good
-You can order ahead and pick it up inside skipping the line

They are fast and friendly and the place is always clean!"}
{"text":"This location is very clean and the employees are really nice. Of course the food is good as well! What sucks is that before 10am the drive thru is very slow. You could be waiting 8 minutes in the drive thru- and that's being one car away from the window. After about 5:45pm the drive thru becomes slow again. You could be waiting about 15-22minutes to get to the window. Those two things are extremely annoying. They should know that these times are busy and they should be prepared. As a mom, it's not always an easy option to do mobile pick up cause I have my child in the car. If we go in he will flip out because he wants to go play but I'm usually in a rush. Other than that, I like chic fill a, just wish they would fix these issues"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with the patience and kindness of the workers at Chick-fil-A. They are always so nice and proactive with getting you what you need. It is a parent's dream - the play place is awesome and I can get a Diet Lemonade and sit in the booth and watch my 3 year old play. The salads are fresh and delicious. The kids meals are great and I really appreciate the toy which is always educational and interactive."}
{"text":"This place is always packed in the drive-thru, but they hustle and they have only messed up once on my order and they did send me two free sandwich meals that I don't really eat.  I actually love their strips (who doesn't) or the grilled nuggets with a salad.  However, they have a new spicy chicken salad that is terrific.  I get it all the time since so close to my work.  They have low calorie dressing options, as well.  Their chicken wrap is a great low-cal meal for when you are on the go."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time this morning. Food was good as usual. Ordered a #1 which is the Chicken Biscuit. The only drawback is it seems as though the chicken biscuits are getting smaller and smaller these days"}
{"text":"Food was good. Fries were nice and hot. One critique though...When you ask a customer a question, but can't hear/understand them, the PROPER response could be: \"I'm sorry can you repeat that,\" or \"I'm sorry, what did you say\" not just \"What?\" I for one, find that kind of rude."}
{"text":"First, chick-fil-a sauce is the greatest substance on the planet. I wouldn't be surprised if it could cure all types of diseases and extend the average human lifespan by twenty years with daily applications/ingestion. In case you haven't tried it, the honey roasted BBQ is also amazing and not as well known. Next to Chick-fil-a sauce, it is the second-greatest substance on the planet. Water is the third.

Not sure what else to say about Chick-fil-a since you've probably been living in a case if you haven't actually been to one. A note of warning: eating chicken here will make you not want to eat chicken at any other fast-food chain. In fact, chick-fil-a is so good, it's probably the closest I've ever gotten to gluttony. During my more indulgent college years, I downed an original chicken sandwhich and a six pack of chicken strips in a single sitting. Didn't think twice about it. I probably wouldn't eaten more it's so good, but my sense of shame always seemed to catch up with me eventually.

That's all for now. I'm going go rub chick-fil-a sauce all over my body."}
{"text":"I love their food and service.  You can always get a chicken something today and crave a chicken something tomorrow.  I would usually get a chicken sandwich or a chicken biscuit for the morning.  The original chicken sandwich always comes out warm and tender.  I love the chicken biscuit with a spread of grape jam and drizzled with honey.  The warm biscuit soaks in the honey well.  The service is there has always been an A+ in my book."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who gave this store all these rave reviews, but it was terrible this morning. I don't know if it's because they're workers are new or just young, but it was horrible service, it took forever to place my order, and I had a long wait to get it. Then once I did receive my chicken burrito, it was half the normal size. Even though they did remake it. Then one of the workers (Marcus) had a meltdown on the manager after she told him he had to stay at the register. It was horrible. If I wasn't a regular Chick Fil A eater, I wouldn't be back. Glad I don't have to come back to this one."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich is good, always fresh vegetables! Fast and friendly costumer service! Always clean and the staff is polite! 
The fries are my favorite and also the part is free refills on the drinks! 
I give it a 5 stars because I've been to many Chick-Fil-A's across the states and i always get the same exceptional service! 
Good food!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Chick-fil-A. Only downfall is that they are closed in Sunday's since Las Vegas is a 24/7 city."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru which wasn't that busy. Specifically asked for 4 sauces for my nuggets. By the time I got home I had none. When I called and explained that happened (also my fries were cold and dry) I was met by dumbfounded silence from the employee who just said I'm sorry I don't know what I can do for you and then more silence. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I go to the one near Metro Center.  It's pretty new. It's their pleasure to serve me and my pleasure to eat it all.  Best chicken and waffle fries ever.  And their sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"This is for all my fast food spicy chicken sandwich connoisseurs

When purchasing spicy chickens your committing to such a delicious food coma and salty bloated haze followed with a gross nap because you just endured a forgot to chew your food face stuffing. Opposite of anything cute or decent.

(Always order 2)

Wendy's was a strong contender until consistency of the sandwich leaned towards more bread than meat. Weak. Time to move on. Be smart.

A guilty pleasure of mine. Will be a tough habit to break... will i ever?... (to be continued)..."}
{"text":"Well I'm a little disappointed in this location. I'm a Paramedic and they denied me a public safety discount stating that they only give it to PD. Now my brothers and sisters in Blue are very deserving but we have always received it at all the other locations previously. Instead of calling it a PD discount, it should be a public safety discount and given to all members who risk our lives daily to serve and protect the communities. Please reconsider this."}
{"text":"great gallina, love it im a regular now, once to twice a week."}
{"text":"Long lines looked scary as we approached but the staff here rocks!!!! So polite and fast! Food was perfect and staff was A+ finally we have a CFA! 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars, I would. Of course the food is good, it's Chick-fil-a. But the attention to detail, customer service, and work ethic is seriously lacking. I have come here at least 100 times in the 2 years I've lived in the area and have had way more negative experiences than positive. Tonight, for example, I ordered a Grilled Cobb salad and a 8 count nugget meal-with a larger diet lemonade. I get to the window to pay and the young man who took my order tries to hand me a regular sized lemonade. I told him it was supposed to be a large and he looks at me like I'm crazy.  Whatever, it is what it is. Then, we got home and sat down to eat and my salad is missing it's dressing. Now, I could get over a missing dipping sauce for the chicken nuggets (which we were missing) as you can eat them without it. However, a salad is typically much better with dressing. Obviously it's much healthier without, but it sure tastes better. I've tried to call the location no less than 3 times to no avail. No one will answer. Not that there's anything they can do now, as I'm not driving back to get dressing, but it's extremely annoying.  I'll be driving to another location from now on, I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Sucks!! Slow as Christmas .... What happened to the sweet tea!??? It use to be the best...."}
{"text":"I goto this chick-fil-a all the time, everyone is super sweet and nice. Never ever no once have I had a problem until Thursday April 7th 2016. Now I'm not one to kiss off easy, but when someone is having a bad day and brings it to work and over the intercom. Well then that's when I have a problem, leave your drama or whatever is going on in your day at the door. So \"Stephanie\" I believe her name was, has a lil sassy attitude and well NO! So I pulled up and asked for a manager and thank the gay lords he was a gay boy! I told him the situation and he said we will take care of it and thank you for the feedback etc. I also said it loud enough so she could hear what I said and she could check her attitude cause if he wasn't going to tell her at least she could hear me saying what I needed to say. Moral of this post is, if you don't like your job or take your problems to work then you shouldn't be there or move the hell on for people who actually need a job and are nice to customers. No one wants to deal with someone who has a stanky ass shit attitude. So \"Stephanie\" I hope you got your act together cause the next time I will have no problem reading you and possibly snatching you up through that big open drive through window :)."}
{"text":"Sweet tea and spicy chicken sandwich was yummy! Spicy chicken was actually spicy which was nice. Also criscut fries were seasoned appropriately."}
{"text":"The highlights were the waffle fries they're light fresh and soft. To die for vanilla milkshake I swear they make it with Haagen Daaz ice cream it's so good. Great variety on the dipping sauces the buffalo, signature and ranch were my fav. This is definitely only for chicken lovers because I personally wasn't crazy about the nuggets or the sandwich except for the fact the breast in my spicy sandwich was so tender juicy and fresh. For some reason the bread got so soggy quick..probably because they're so busy and gotta throw it together. Their system is well thought out and customer service with the cashiers and managers was very pleasant and friendly. Welcome Chick Fil A!"}
{"text":"I am not typically the complaining type but went to this restaurant about a month ago for breakfast while out running errands. Ordered two sandwiches with one substituting a biscuit instead of a bagel. This order was taken to go and upon opening, realized both were wrong. We returned to the restaurant to have the order corrected only to have it made messed up the second time. Also, the cashier was not apologetic in the least. Emailed the restaurant to discuss the experience as I didn't believe it was handled correctly and have yet to hear back from the restaurant so clearly customer service is not the focus of management which is disappointing for a Chick Fil A which likes to pride themselves on customer service."}
{"text":"I'm done ordering the nuggets! I've been to this location 5 times and every. single. time. 5/5 TIMES I've received half yummy nuggets and half small burnt pieces of chicken which is sad because their dipping sauces are to die for and I love chicken nuggets. I recently tried a different location and the nuggets were all good so not sure whats going on here. 

This location is close to work for me and the drive thru is quick even when it is packed so I decided to try again and order something different this time. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was so good. It comes in a little plastic container and cut in half so I was able to eat half and save the other half for later which I liked.."}
{"text":"I usually love this place...
I went in today at 3:33pm and I ordered the 8pc chicken nuggets. They were barely warm, like they had been sitting out for a while under a heat lamp, making them chewy and tough.  
The waffle fries didn't have enough salt.
Sad meal."}
{"text":"You know the food is good and the folks who work here definitely like to exceed their quota of \"my pleasure\" in a day. Super fast drive thru no matter how long it gets. If it's not BoTime,then we go here."}
{"text":"Good food, clean playground, large enough for adults to go in with a toddler. Staff was very respectful and nice."}
{"text":"Great Chick-fil-A...good food and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-a has amazing service and friendly people.  The food tastes good and I had it quick and fresh.

I will say that I disagree with Chick-fil-a's stance on sexuality.  I do think that every person (or corporation) has a right to their own opinions and are allowed to spend their money however they choose to.  In the end, I just wish everyone would stop putting politics in my food.

In regards for a yelp review...The food was yummy, hot and fresh.  Great service and a clean eating environment."}
{"text":"The Chicken Here Is AMAZZZZZING!! Service Staff Training Crew Was Friendly, Efficient, and Just AWESOME!!!

We came here the day after the big \"Grand Opening\" and as we thought it was super busy. With a drive thru line that was so many cars deep I couldn't even count, we decided to go inside. 

Line was long but moved suprisingly fast. Staff was super friendly. Our order was big and what impressed me the most was it was complete. Nothing wrong or missing!! EVEN with a full restaurant. 5 stars there!! Woot! Woot!!!

I have never been to a Chick-fil-A. This was my first time, and after I tasted their chicken sandwich  I understand what all the hype is about! It's absolutely DELICIOUS!! Chick-fil-A - \"A Fan I Am! :)\"

Only thing I would change is adding ANOTHER location in Summerlin! Pretty Please :)

If you are in the area I highly recommend this location! Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Chick-Fil-A, but after going through the drive thru realized this location just isn't doing it right. I got my food in the drive thru but had to go inside THREE times after the fact for their errors. They gave me diet instead of regular lemonade. No ranch (when I asked, they said it was in the bag.) AND an extremely burnt cookie. Hard as a rock. I'll go to another location from now on. Thank gosh I discovered their errors before I drove home, because I would've ended up with $10 worth of nothing edible."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this chain. I love the waffle fries and chic o sandwich . 
I don't understand why this location is so slow. I've been to many and this is the slowest"}
{"text":"Just a terribly run location.  They seem to be constantly understaffed even during peak rush hours.  Service and drive-thru are super slow and I have to constantly check the order as it is frequently wrong or missing items.  The staff is nice and friendly and trying hard, but this place is so poorly run. Corporate really needs to pay them a visit."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Chick fila. I always have friendly fast service. This location has the worst service I have ever received from a Chick fila. I've never waited so long for food at Chick fila. Please address the speed of service."}
{"text":"Food is uninspired, dry, tasteless and bland.  Not worth the effort, not just because of the food, but because it is always busy for some reason."}
{"text":"Nice clean location, friendly staff. 
Two stars because they have, and I have let them, forget my ice cream cone twice."}
{"text":"Iam absolutely in love with this place. I'm currently dieting and they get me!!! Healthy options and very promt and efficient service. That frozen lemonade smoothie hits the spot!!"}
{"text":"No need for me to review the food because I never have issues when it comes to getting my food quick AND hot. But let me shine light on John (he was my cashier but he could be apart of management...IDK). I come to this Chic-Fil-A although it's not close to the destination of the college I attend BUT something about the customer service here just keeps me coming back. Don't get me wrong the 2 other CFA's in town are great also but this one here on Eastern I'll forever travel to. Anyways back to my review, I ordered my food with John and I see him walk away, not to get my drink BUT to get me a hand full of mints  When I tell you I almost teared up because I didn't even have to ask, he just knew that would be my next question. Obviously I'm a regular and before I leave I always ask for a hand full of mints because not only are they so soft but they keep me moving and grooving while in my long hour classes. So from this day forward, I will FOREVER keep traveling to this CFA and at least I know John has my back when it comes to those mints."}
{"text":"Great staff! I have always heard that chick-fil-a staff is extremely nice. That is indeed the case, however the food was good at best. I would eat here again it just wouldn't be my first choice"}
{"text":"Ok, so I really love everything on the menu at chick fil a! All the employees are super friendly and always accommodate me with whatever I need! Only reason for the 4 stars is cause their closed Sundays!"}
{"text":"Cold sandwich, cheese not melted, fries also cold and only 5 full waffle fries in the box, thanks for nothing chick fil a..."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick bite. I got the spicy chicken sandwich, wasn't spicy at all. But the chicken was really good. Typical fast food"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place does NOT have an average of 5 stars...

Coming from the South, I was ecstatic to hear that there was a Chick-Fil-A in Madison. It is by FAR my favorite fast food chain, and definitely the most delicious thing you can get for its price. While it isn't the cheapest fast food around, I do believe that you pay for the quality of food and service.

This branch is located conveniently next to West Towne Mall, and it has EXCEPTIONAL service. The staff constantly came around asking if I needed refills, how my food was, and offered to take my tray away when I was done with my food. I've been to a lot of Chick-Fil-A's, and that's not something that they all do!

Check this place out if you've never had Chick-Fil-A and learn what all the hype is about :)"}
{"text":"It's a Chick-Fil-A, you know the drill: you only seem to crave it on Sundays. Well, unless you're my friend Ashley who had it for both lunch and dinner yesterday.

I don't eat a ton of fast food, but Chick-Fil-A is in my rotation when I do. This location is kind of tricky. It's always busy. If you're trying to turn left onto South Blvd when leaving here, good luck. It probably will not happen. Traffic seems to always be non-stop crazy on South Blvd. 

They have an actual person walk up to your window to take your order while you wait in the drive-thru line (allegedly speeds up the process). Personally, it makes me uncomfortable to look at the menu and debate just how many nuggets I need while a person hovers over me. Watching. Judging. Oh well.

Also, Chick Fil A sauce is superior to all other sauces here. Shout out to Sarah C for teaching me that very valuable piece of info. Can't believe I've been wasting all these years on Polynesian sauce."}
{"text":"I too disagree with Chick-Fil-A's corporate stated stance on gay marriage, etc. (made the news a while back).  Some of the kindest, most intelligent, dynamic,  and talented people I know are gay, and they are BORN that way.   I am conservative on some issues, and liberal on others, like many folks.  That said, what a great place!  The employees and managers are very kind and congenial, with a great, positive, friendly attitude and demeanor.  We feel very welcome when we enter this excellent establishment.  Most transactions are answered with the words \"my pleasure!\"  I have not heard that phrase since the 70's!  Very nice.  The children's events and charity events are much appreciated as well.  The food tastes great, and I especially love the 'chicken minis' breakfast sandwiches.  My only wish is that they offered these all day!  Even though this is a national chain, it is apparently owned (franchised?) and run by a kind 'mom and pop' family, who are always there to provide the utmost in customer service.  I've been patronizing this place for years, and I have never had a negative experience!  I used to bring my toddler here when she just learned to walk, and still bring her here now that she's in 3rd Grade!"}
{"text":"I stopped coming here a few months ago because my order kept being wrong. I stopped to get breakfast today for myself and a friend, I ordered 2 drinks and 2 breakfast sandwiches. After waiting 11 minutes in line due tobthe lady ahead of me having a very large order,  I arrived to the window. They repeated the order back to me correctly. They gave me the correct drinks and then a bag of food. When I arrived to my location there were 3 orders of breakfast potatoes in the bag and no sandwiches. Neither one of us we at the potatoes.  I do like their food better than other fast-food places but wrong orders really frustrate me and I don't have the time to go back for them to make it right."}
{"text":"I was pleased to see this restaurant. I live In Las Vegas... Where we don't have the pleasure of binging on their yummy chicken. I was happy to find this location staffed with efficient employers. Our food order was correct and came out quickly."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I have EVER received in my life! Went through the drive thru with my family and placed our order. We were sent to the parking lot to wait...OK, it happens, so we waited. It would have been nice for Chick-fil-A to give us our drinks while we waited, considering it was quite warm out and we had already paid for them but that didn't happen. We waited 20 minutes and FINALLY an extremely depressed person by the name of Kayla came out to bring us our food, literally dragging her feet!! You could hear her shoes....clump....clump....clump as she brought our order out to us. She say's absolutely nothing when she hands my husband the bag of food and proceeds to walk away. My husband ask \"are you bringing our drinks next?\" Kayla says in a monotone voice \"you ordered drinks?\" My Husband still being polite smiles and says \"yes we did.\" We wait another 15 minutes and clump.....clump.....clump.....here comes our drinks. We say thanks and leave. Starving we decide to pull out the grilled chicken nuggets and snack on the way home. I kid you not folks, these nuggets we soggy, sponge like things that truly could not be actual food. Not sure what this restaurant is thinking or what kind of chicken parts they are using but it is not food! And the service....well there is no service."}
{"text":"Boy this location is busy on a Saturday morning!! The drive thru was full so we opted to go inside. The inside was also busy!!! Lol!!! Service was quick though. They had is in and out with in 8-10 mins. I got my regular chick fil a chicken biscuit combo with tea. The cashier walked out items to us. Got to love Chick Fil a's awesome service."}
{"text":"Typical Chick-fil-a -fast, clean and very hospitable. Loads of teens as servers. Stopped by to grab a quick breakfast before a road trip. Was very alarmed by the news of them and no other Charlotte area Chick-fail-a is carrying the spicy chicken biscuit. Seems like they could use the same spicy chicken meat from the sandwich but I guess not. Only complaint was the sweet tea was not sweet at all. Everyone in my car group exchanged theirs for another soft drink option."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorites Chick-fil-a in the Charlotte area!!! And that's saying a lot cause the others try but these guys really represent!!I've been coming to this Chick-fil-A forever. I can remember back to my days at Myers Park High school and making quick runs to grab food. 

Beware of the dreaded drive thru line. Today it was backed all the way up to the gas station on the corner of Woodlawn and Park Road. That being said I normally park on the other side of the drive thru because if you park on the side with the drive thru line you will have to inch your way out when you leave. 

This Chick-fil-A always cook their food correctly and everything is always above the standard. I'm kinda picky and some of the other guys don't cook the hashbrowns correctly but here they are always crispy and never over cooked. I know this makes me sound extra but it's the little things that count. 

The staff here is amazing!!! April the team leader is soooo nice and personable. She remembers my name and is super helpful. She makes every time I stop at Chick-dil-a a treat.

{"text":"Out of all the Chick-fil-As I frequently visit this location is quickly becoming my least favorite. It all had to stem from the food. The service is still spot on. I'm just convinced they can't cook good breakfast. Last week I went threw the drive thur and ordered 2 hash browns. Both packets were cold and greasy. I called and they said they would replace them. Today I got the replacements and they weren't cold but still weren't up to par like the other locations. My mother and I also both ordered breakfast sandwiches and both of the biscuits were thick and doughy. I love Chick-fil-A but probably will not be coming to this location for breakfast for awhile."}
{"text":"It's Finally Here!!! So glad to have Chick-fil-A here in Vegas. It really reminds me of back home. The food is amazing, the service is always on point, and the staff is super nice. Best chicken sandwich ever!!!"}
{"text":"Employees are always friendly and helpful. They bring your food to you and restaurant and bathrooms are always very clean and well stocked. Employees work the dining room area by asking if they can get you a refill, take your trash, is your food ok? WHAT the WHAT? Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here while waiting on my new truck to get the windows tinted over at Cactus Window Tinting. Clean, well stocked and employees are great and efficient. Would be great if they had newspapers to read in the mornings like other locations I have been to."}
{"text":"Why is it that Chick-fil-A seems to have great customer service at almost every location? Why can't the other fast food chains get it right like these guys? Friendly employees (none of which I saw using a cell phone on-duty), fast service and my order is always right. Keep it up Chick-fil-A, whatever you're doing is working! :O)"}
{"text":"Love this location even though its tough sometimes to get in and out of. Service is good, staff is friendly and helpful. Restaurant is clean and drive thru is faster than average."}
{"text":"This seems to be a busy location, but the service was above average and my order was timely, hot and correct. They have a roving attendant in the dining room to keep everything clean, stocked and provide any additional condiments and/or refills that you might require."}
{"text":"These guys have got it going on! Two people PHYSICALLY out in the drive thru during rush periods to help take and expedite orders. GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"This place is near my parents house and I gotta say that I'm dangerously addicted. This location in particular has awesome staff and the chicken tenders and sandwiches are always delicious! I love it and I just can't stop! :| eat mo chicken :)"}
{"text":"Some of my friends been talking about this place for months but I have never tried it or wanted to try because  of 2 very strong reasons. 

1. I do not like fast food really
2. Fried food gives me a heartburn

However I'm in Pittsburgh meeting up my in laws and wanted to get something before we catch a movie . Place seemed packed so I had my hopes up. But really it wasn't anything special. Their signature sauce my wife and in-laws liked it is nothing but a mix of mustard mayonnaise and bbq in other word a slightly smokey honey mustard. The meat on the other hand was spot on. Very nice flavor and well cooked. It was real chicken and you can tell from the thickness of it also was moist. Wasn't very happy with their waffle fries as when I hear about waffle fries I expect some seasoning.

So the bottom line is the chicken is great but rest is just what you expect from a chain  fast food joint."}
{"text":"This is one of the best CFA's I have visited.  Lots of smiling faces and superb customer service.  Young high school aged staff from what I can tell. They go above and beyond in the customer service category."}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating here, they have great hospitality and every time I go I have my food out in a matter of seconds! I love the spicy chicken sandwich and the nuggets are always delicious. They have the best lemonade and sweet tea. I've tried the chicken minis and they are so good! They have honey on the bun and the chicken biscuit is one of the best options to get in the morning! Don't forget to ask for some chick fil a sauce while you're at it"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the spicy chicken sandwich.  They literally kill you will kindness here.  I think if you came in with a horrible attitude and talked to one of the staff it would be difficult to be mean to any of them.  They go above and beyond to give you the best most kind device available."}
{"text":"Poor customer service in the drive thru. Ordered a 64 count tray and got charged for another 8 ounce sauce. White round girl never mentioned I would be charged. In Los Angeles sauce is free , it's not even the money...principle. 


Overall , food quality is great."}
{"text":"Southwest salad is okay for a fast food joint. This is only my second time to a Chik-fil-A in a few years. Staff very courteous, if not drinking Mickie Ds Koolaid,  with a welcome shout-out to every customer. Fast food cults are gastronomic salvation to sojourners. Even the manager is picking up trays and assuring the faithful with praise. Get in here. There's a man in sandals and a robe turning cows into chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"I feel strange reviewing a fast food chain, but I was truly amazed by this Chik Fil A's dedication to service. I had initially felt pure dread when I pulled up to a line of at least 8 cars during a busy lunch hour. I couldn't resist a certain waffle fry craving. My fears of a 15 minute fast food line were quickly dissolved though when I saw two young ladies taking orders down the line. Making sure that all customers orders were in the system no matter where they were in line. The cars started to move with such ease. There was two other employees on the front lines easing traffic.  One took my cash while I was still pretty far from the delivery window,  and there was another guy running the bags of food and drinks to cars further back in line. I was out of that line in less than 5 minutes! 
The sheer organization and efficiency of this place is wonderful! 
Of course the waffle fries were bomb,  and the chicken sandwich was sufficient. Could use a little more flavor,  but I'm not complaining. This franchise really has it together!"}
{"text":"This place seems to be an average fast food place. I got the grilled chicken sandwich combo meal #7.  I got the fruit cup in lieu of fries, and a diet coke to drink.  The sandwich tasted OK although I've had better at other chick-fil-a's.  The fruit was good with strawberries, blueberries, apple pieces, and orange slices. The cashier filled the styrofoam cup all the way to the top with ice and then added the soda.  Trying to put the straw in the cup forced an ice cube out the side of the styrofoam cup.  It was a disaster lol."}
{"text":"Our favorite place on cheat days. Fresh fruit and chicken strips. But everyone loves Chick-fil-a! Staff here is awesome and friendly. On busy lunch rushes, they even have people outside taking orders to speed things along. Awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype at all. Before Chick-fil-A came to Las Vegas, I had eaten there twice. Both times the food was just subpar. This time the same. Service was okay. Lemonade was good but the sweet tea wasn't sweet at all. The chicken sandwich was good but the chicken nuggets were disgusting. BBQ sauce was good but the ranch was super watery. The fries are horrible. Not crispy at all & just mushy with no actual seasoning to them. I just don't understand why people hype this place up so much. If I want food chicken, I'll go to Raising Canes where the food actually tastes good for what I'm paying. Chick-fil-A isn't event worth dollar menu prices. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"First off, Chick-fil-A is no big deal to me. I've been eating it all my life. It used to only be in malls like Hot dog on a stick. I used to always eat it at the mall as a kid/teenager. I had not had it since I left Texas in 2012 and I ain't driving to Henderson just for a sandwich and some nuggets. The drive thru line is like In-N-Out which is crazy. I'm not waiting that long. So I look online and see they have an app! 

I get the app and place my order. When I get there I tap, \"I'm here.\" I park in the parking lot and go up to the app order window. Employees everywhere are always polite and that's especially unusual in Vegas so it's even more appreciated. You also get rewards for using the app. It was excellent not to have to wait in line. 

We ordered a kids meal (nearly $8.00!), Two sandwich combos and 2-12 piece nuggets. It was $35.00. It's much cheaper in Texas! 

I get in the car and can't wait to eat. Then I realize they forgot my sandwich. The kid at the window was a sweetheart. I'll revise and add his name. He gave me my sandwich no problem and realized he forgot to scan the app on my phone. Then he tells me to order a water on my app since it's free so I can get credit for both purchases. 

He was very enthusiastic and friendly and talked about how much he likes his job. That's so refreshing to hear in this town where everyone seems to be hopeless. 

We will be back often. It's a staple. You can't avoid it."}
{"text":"About time they came to town. I love this place. It is pretty crazy right now being so new. Make sure you have a long lunch or the line will kill you. Worth the wait thought."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is always a solid go to favorite for fast food.
 lots of delicious options and I love the app. Great way to scan and get free food. If you are not using the app when you eat here you are being silly. You don't need to pre-load money like Other places and the free food always seems to add up quickly.

I also purchased the calendar card annually and every month have something great today's item a free fruit cup and large beverage valued at over four dollars was more than half of the cost of the calendar and you get free items every month.
It's a no brainer and honestly the calendars are always cute."}
{"text":"My kids go to this location almost every morning. The customer service is awesome.  Always greeted with a smile no matter how early.  And my kids go pretty early.  Especially during the week heading to school n work.  Thank you for treating my kids awesome.  They pass by two other locations to stop at this one.  This is their go to.  Keep it up.  You will definitely keep their business.  N mine!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best fast food in the area. Never had any problems with orders and meals are always consistent. Menu is alway being expanded with new foods equally as good such as the mac-n-cheese side. Also the ice in the drinks is the chewable ice which is in my opinion the best and is in foam cups which stay cold for a while."}
{"text":"Busy at lunchtime with a variety of ages of customers. Nice play area for kids. Parking is an issue as the cars lined up for the drivethru make it impossible to park on one side of the parking space. Entrance only on 44th...can't be accessed from Indian School Rd. Service is good and quick. Appreciate that they always bring food out to you. Quality food with good portions. Wish they had a drink station to refill your own cup."}
{"text":"People that rate this place 5 stars should read the list of ingredients they use. Everything they serve is loaded with MSG."}
{"text":"I love chick fil but I have never been to a more consistently bad location!! The last handful of times my food has been stone cold and tasted like it had been sitting under the heater all day. Today I finally had enough and asked for fresh chicken strips and both managers looked at me like I was stupid, but did end up exchanging the chicken. I think it's ridiculous to be treated like that when you are providing nasty ass food!! $9 chicken strips and I can't request them hot?? Or even warm.. sad sad sad because like everyone else on here, I love chick fil a. I am officially done with this location."}
{"text":"This review may seem strange to some because I am a vegetarian. The ONLY reason I came here is because their french fries and chocolate shake are gluten free. It's been a long time since I've had french fries because most places fry them in oil along side wheat, breaded items. NOT Chick-fil-A. I will be back when I want fries or a shake. 

I didn't give 5 stars because all their salad dressings contain wheat. Oh well."}
{"text":"Food is consistent but service is poor. I ordered a meal 2 times ago with a side salad instead of fries and received salad dressing and fries, no salad. Placed same order today and again didn't get a salad but caught before I left. No apology and still confusion at the window. This was after repeating my order twice in line and having it repeated back to me"}
{"text":"Been wanting to eat at this location for awhile and I finally did. The staff was amazing everyone was very friendly. I even notice when they took an order to the table the guess had forgotten their straws And the girl notice and offered to get them some very awesome gesture. They keep it nice and clean. I will definitely be coming back . My favorite place to come from now on."}
{"text":"I love love love chick fil-a and like the owners and the women who runs the blakeney chick fil-a but many of the teens here do not even try to get the orders right.  There are so many times we don't have sauce or they forgot to make our drinks and we have to wait and wait.  And they're attitudes are awful when they do mess up.  The most unconscientious kids around work at this location.  I avoid this location if I can for this reason."}
{"text":"Great quality fast food but kinda pricey.  When you want to live it up for best tasting chicken fingers , fries, and drinks.  It is #1 in my book."}
{"text":"I love chick-fil-a, but this one definitely stands out above the rest! The staff are always so friendly and definitely go above and beyond. They all seem to love their jobs and really want to give every customer a great experience. They bring your food out to you, take it away when you're done, and check on you throughout the meal. At any given time, there is usually someone cleaning all parts of the restaurant.
     The kids that I nanny love to come here to eat and play in the play area. The only complaint I've ever had here is that once while we were there they made all of the kids stop playing to clean the playground. It's good that they keep it clean, but we were given 10 minutes notice almost right after the kids started playing and they were very disappointed. 
     The food is always great and the restaurant is always so clean. I also love that they give you free refills on drinks. I've never been to the drive thru at this location, but my dine in experience with he kids is always great!"}
{"text":"Holy moly, I have NEVER seen a Chick Fil A so packed! Clearly the area is in need of a freestanding location. 

I went at 12:30pm on a Friday. The drive thru line was wrapped all around the lot. The inside wasn't much better. The lines backed up to the entrance which made it tough to navigate your way in the dining room. The crew was on top of the chaos though. All the registers were open and orders were getting filled seemingly quickly. They were super friendly and appreciative of customers' patience.   

Expect the same deliciousness that you've experienced at other Chick Fil A's. This one also has a nice outdoor area, indoor kiddie play spot and a drive thru. 

The bathrooms are nice. The womens is a little awkward though. There are two stalls and only one sink."}
{"text":"I freaking l.o.v.e Chick-fil-A.  Unfortunately I haven't lived within 200 miles of a Chick-fil-A in over 10 years.  So I fill up when I'm back in Ohio.  It's the only time I eat fast food (well....and In'N'Out when in CA).

I was so happy when this location opened up because 1. it's not a mall and 2. it's in Summit county.  I've always had to go to North Olmstead or Mentor to enjoy delicious chicken nuggets.  Now I can get my chix fix and then shop at Target.  

I don't know what kind of employee training program they have at this place....but keep it up people! Before I even walked in, the guy taking out the trash said hello to me.  Then he walked over and held the door open for me!  When I thanked him, he replied \"It's my pleasure\".  I hadn't even ordered anything and I was already happy. The woman at the counter was super friendly too!  I got another \"It's my pleasure\" after I thanked her. 

The food was, of course, delicious.  The nuggets...the strips....the sandwich...the coleslaw....the waffle fries....YUM."}
{"text":"It's Chick-Fil-A. They are the nicest, the food is delicious, the containers they serve chicken salad sandwiches on are perfect to keep and use as leftover containers, their sauce is delicious, they are so helpful and throw away your trash if you sit there with it on your table for too long, WHY CAN'T THEY BE OPEN ON SUNDAYS THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THIS PLACE COULD BE BETTER."}
{"text":"I specifically didn't eat all day so that I was ravenously hungry for my first visit to this restaurant. The second I walked in my mouth salivated in anticipation. We were able to order quickly, beaming with excitement because they had soup on the menu. Fast food restaurant with soup!?!? Yes, Culver's also has soup, but Culver's doesn't have spicy chicken sandwiches on their menu. Double miracle!  We were given our receipt and told our food would be delivered to our table. Minutes ticked by as I sat by the edge of my seat, watching as employees brought out steaming trays of food to other guests at the restaurant.  My patience grew thin as I started to notice car after car get through the drive through and drive off with their food while I still waited for mine.  10, 15, 20 minutes go by. Finally went back to the counter and the employees said they forgot our food. Forgot our food!?!?  I could have butchered a chicken and cooked it myself in this amount of time. Seriously, I've done it before.  To make up for the wait, the employee gave us two free sandwich gift cards, which was a nice gesture, but I'll give them away. I don't want to be disappointed again."}
{"text":"I honestly don't like to write reviews about fast food places, because really, for the most part you get what you pay for, and there's nothing extraordinary, or un-extraordinary about the food usually...its just a quick easy fix.

That being said - really not impressed with the Chick-fil-A on Stapley. I went through the Drive Thru tonight - Friday night around 9:30. There's literally no one inside and only one car in front of me. And yet they had me waiting at the window forever for my food. Most fast food joints - you're in, you're out, done deal. Not the case here, at least not tonight.

I finally got my food, and the fries could barely pass as warm. I thought maybe the wait was because the guy was doing a new batch of fries, but no, these were quite stale, no salt, and pretty much cold within a short time.

The soda - Diet Dr. Pepper - was watered down. 

There were like 8 people behind the counter just messing around not doing anything.

And it cost me over $7 for a crappy meal. Lesson learned, will not be returning there."}
{"text":"I usually get the Deluxe Spicy Chicken which is pretty good with the Chik Fil A sauce. Canes is honestly better, but I'm just giving 3 stars because the restroom is filthy.

Update: owner messaged me and she was so graceful! She let me know that they're working on the bathroom situation. Food is still delicious though!"}
{"text":"The only surprise here is that it's just as amazing every time I come in. Not only is the chicken amazing but the people are so nice it seems almost like they are there just for me.  Definitely try them out. 
Today I got a Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap with Spicy dressing, the wrap was not overwhelming and the bread actually had flavor, i didn't tear away prices like I do with most wraps at fast food joints."}
{"text":"Pretty much anything is good, today I decided on the grilled chicken club :)

Was not disappointed, usually the bacon is a little bit flavorless, but today is was delicious. The lettuce was not soggy (which is surprising because they do not use iceberg) and the tomato (which i always remove one) was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Thing have gotten better here, not that they weren't good  to begin with.  Haven't had any issues the last few times and they added a great dining room host. Also one of the few CFA's that has the option to \"dine in\" on the mobile app.. so that is good. 

As usual I got the Cobb salad today, with chicken strips instead of nuggets, was great quality as usual.. the only drawback to a CFA salad is that all the other fast food salads are inedible to me now.. 

Also had the new frosted sunrise dessert, was delicious but is probably better for two :)"}
{"text":"Mark P. obviously hasn't been to this location because it is on Peoria and not Dunlap, but he did write an amazing story. Anyways this spot is like any other Chick Fil A, clean, courteous, and delicious. Though not many are as kind or \"hook ups\" friendly as Arrowhead or Go the extra mile to remove ONLY the onions from my chicken breakfast burrito as Deer Valley, this store meets my expectations as the best quality food quickly joint for a quick lunch bite, even with all the new choices in the area, it is still my go to place. I ordered my Chick Fil A sandwich \"protein style\" and they were very generous with the lettuce they wrapped it in, and are always happy to give you a LARGE ice water (unlike Canes who charges for any cup smaller than their little Dixies) here is the kicker, the protein style is actually cheaper than the regular sandwich! Love this place"}
{"text":"Best fast food out there. Get the app, you will get great coupons and the more you go the more treats you get on the app. Love the chicken, love the waffle fries (covered in mayo), love the iced coffee, love the wraps, live the nuggets, love the super food side, love the friendly staff, love the super clean restaurants, love everything about Chick Fil A. If you haven't been, GO. If you have, you know what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"Well i use to live in California where i loved it.... But my 1st time here in Vegas & though the line inside to eat moved quickly less than 5 minutes i ordered a #2 Spicy Chicken Sandwich meal & a 4 pc tenders Dine in.... Total was $13 & some change no problem i knew the prices going in.... Now the problem I'm having after sitting waiting for my food i notice there were 2-3 people who already received there food & an employee walking around asking some who havent received there order myself included are you & is your name Robert or Roberto?.... Still waiting i see a group of 6 people get there food.... I now get up walk to the counter... I'm assuming on of the managers may i help you? I answer yes I've been waiting for my order? I give them my name & receipt i say Tony but my name was never asked for by the cashier.... One employee says his order is right here under Roberto (if this isn't a stereotype or racist shit I've heard) yea I'm not Roberto i repeat i was never asked to give my name.... The one employee states we will get you a fresh order i say ok already upset & highly disappointed at this point.... Then the original guy who started to help me says here you go sorry about the inconvenience & gives me a free sandwich card?... I guess thanks goes through my head.... I sit down still to eat it there & fries were soggy as was the sandwich!!!! Strips were extremely soggy too!!! Clearly weren't made fresh for me already knowing they didn't by passing me this garbage of a free sandwich card maybe comp my meal i just paid for since it was literally over 15-20minutes old.... None of the problem was my doing? I'm a general manager of a papa John's pizza & mistakes do happen if need be fix the mistake & please the customer! 

#1 Name was never asked for at time of order= not my mistake it's your cashier

#2 When walking around with my order instead of asking me or any other customer if are name is Robert or Roberto check receipt to see if order matches.

#3 Don't say you're going to remake my order fresh for me & not do so.

#4 i understand you want sales but maybe Refund me or make my soda & fries Large size now for the wait... 

#5 is what you decided to do... Give me a free sandwich card... So yea i guess thanks... But i don't agree with how unapologetic the were sorry was... It was as though this location messes up often & just said Oops give this guy a card... Just horrible... I'd give zero stars if i could"}
{"text":"I admit we did come in very close to closing time, I normally get the 30 pc nuggets to share with the family. How the heck are you out of nuggets? Or is just that you didnt want to make them this close to closing? Then by the time we're done discussing this you point out that its after 10 anyways. So are you saying that now no matter what I order it cant be done? I was so frustrated that I just walked out."}
{"text":"The best ! I've been here 4-5 times. Every time I go inside  everyone in the front counter treats you with welcomes. I go with my 1 year old son and every time they help me get a high chair, they always take my food to my table, they are really quick as well, I always go around lunch time, never gone at night, drive thru moves pretty fast at lunch hours. Do recommend !"}
{"text":"So glad that a chic-fil-a opened in the area, the staff and quality of food is always consistent and of a higher service than most other fast food restaurants. Looking forward to having this option available next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I hate that you guys are closed on Sundays! But I love the food and the sweet tea~I also love when you guys bring in the Cow for the kids so cute!"}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is pitiful. This is the third time in a row I have asked for sauces and dressings and they NEVER give it to you.  Might I add I have only neb to this location 3x. One would think they get it right at least once,  AT LEAST ONCE!!!!!!!! No they never will,  never going back to this place. They care more about drive through wait times than they do about getting it right.  I can check my bag one would argue,  but it's it too much to ask for proper service?  You try eating a dry food and see how much you like it."}
{"text":"The only complaint I ever have about this location is the parking lot. It is tiny and poorly set up and dangerous. There have been multiple times that I have seen people near run over or backed Into. There are just too meny people trying to squeeze into too small a space, really no matter what time of day it is. 

The food is always good and always consistent. The store inside and out is always clean. About half of the time there is a wait for grilled chicken. 

I do which the employees would be genuinely polite instead of pretnsiously polite."}
{"text":"Gosh, I haven't been to a chick fila in ages! I was overdue to get my chicken on, so I stopped in here after my interview.  Place was like every other chick fila I've been to, and it was busy because it was a busy with lunch hour people.

The line was long when I got here, but the staff was really good about taking orders and getting the food out fast. I usually go with the regular chicken sandwich, which I think is a #1 on their menu.  The drinks here never seem big enough, and I had to get a refill mid meal.  Also, the fries seemed to be a little undercooked, but edible.

Even after the whole political thing about chick fila last year, I do frequent them from time to time. I don't normally come to this side of town, but when i saw them, I knew it was going to be good food. Overall good clean location, and their food usually doesn't disappoint. I LOVE their chicken bagels for breakfast! They are so tasty! It sux that their closed on Sundays, but oh well."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and such a productive drive-thru line during lunch time. The people working made my day. Not to mention the best chicken sandwich out there!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest day at Chick-fil-A today :( I ordered 2 meals with sauce today in the drive-thru and when I got to the window (I'm not sure if the worker was a trainee or not) but he said hi is this order for Jane? My name is Jen, but i could've been heard wrong so I asked a chicken nugget meal, a deluxe sandwich, and if mayo was in the bag , he said yes, handed me my bag then said have a good day. I told him I had drinks and he said \"oh, a sprite and a coke?\" And I said yes and he gave me the drinks. Then I asked if the straws were in the bag and he pulled out two straws and gave them to me and apologized. I wanted to trust that my ranch and buffalo sauce were in the bag when I pulled away and I felt awkward asking for a third thing from him! I get home and there were no sauces :( I'm not angry.. I'm just one of those picky eaters that loves loves their sauces with their food. It also kinda felt like I had to do the windows job and ask him for all of my sides (which I had already ordered in the drive-thru). 

If he was training, it might be useful for the trainers to be a little more aware of what is/isn't handing out to customers, and if he wasn't training I'd check how well some of your employees know quality service! 
I'll definitely be back but I'll have to search my bag and make sure everything is correct before I leave the window after this, which is something I didn't have to do before :("}
{"text":"The new Chick Fil A at Waverly is great! The brand new building provides a clean and welcoming environment. Coupled with the amazingly friendly staff, Chick Fil A delivers superior fast food!"}
{"text":"I don't care for the political views of this corporate establishment, so I'm torn to dine here. I do love their southwest chicken salad with the avocado dressing though. My companion loves the spicy chicken meal with fries and soda.  I had the salad a couple of times and haven't been disappointed. Crunchy veggies, hot chicken and flavorful dressing on top. Their fun artwork on the walls are pretty funny. I love cows though! The place is clean throughout. There's a play place for the little ones. Great location near the mall. The parking lot offers some parking options, but I have a feeling that it gets full quickly. I have been in the drive-thru before and had to pull away from the window to wait for my order. I waited almost 10 minutes for my order that time. Anyone parking on the north side of the building has to walk around the building to enter. That may be problematic with the amount of mall traffic. Anyone with accessibility issues may not be able to make that particular trip as you have to encounter cars in the parking lot and the traffic from the drive thru too. This would also be a little scary with small children. They should have more allotted spots in their designated parking lot for these particular groups of people.  Love love love the waffle fries! I did steal a couple of those from my dining companion. Don't tell on me!"}
{"text":"They are still rushing orders through.
Gross fries and soggy buns do not make a good sandwhich"}
{"text":"The service here is amazing. I'm so impressed with the staff - always helpful and courteous. The restaurant is always clean, food is tasty and my kids love the play area. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Chik-Fil-A for over 10 years and the chicken, fries, fresh-squeezed lemonade and shakes have always been excellent! 

I should have written this review a long time ago! The excellent customer service I received when going through the drive-thru on Saturday evening inspired me to finally write this overdue review.

I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich, chicken tenders and fries and for whatever reason the order took longer than usual. The woman in the drive-thru was a Team Leader and was very friendly and struck up a conversation with me for several minutes while I was waiting. I don't think anyone has ever done that in all my years of going through drive thrus! Usually, you wait at the window and the person walks away or they ask you to pull up and bring you the food several minutes later. This was a pleasant surprise! Good job Chik-Fil-A for the wonderful customer service this time and EVERY time I have ever gone to one of you restaurants!"}
{"text":"I've had Chick-fil-A a few times now, nothing really stands out to me like any other fast food place. In comparison to Canes, I think Canes is way better! Canes has better sauce and bigger portions for sure. I do like the southwest salad here it's pretty good and filling. The line moves pretty quick and it's cool they have the option to place an order through their app. If you don't want to wait I would order ahead and pick it up, so much quicker!"}
{"text":"Pretty good fast food restaurant.  Don't eat fast food too often and generally avoid factory farmed meats but when I've eaten here the food is pretty good.  The service is good although everyone always saying \"my pleasure\" to you gets annoying and is insincere.  :)"}
{"text":"Dear Chick-Fil-A at San Tan, 

I love You...but if you don't stop handing me my drink with a bajillion ounces of Soda slopped all over the side of the cup I'm gonna go bananas.

I didn't order a handful of Soda. I ordered a cup of Soda. Keep the Soda in the cup or wipe it off before you hand it to your customers. 

Stop it. Seriously.

Ok, that is all."}
{"text":"The last three times I've been to this location, they have gotten the order incorrect. I'm only ordering for two people. And for some reason they constantly get the order wrong."}
{"text":"Let's face it all locations are always packed but this one is specifically packed because of its closeness to the shopping areas but I'm fine with the wait because the employees are quick, kind, and have never messed an order up. The inside is clean and well maintained even during busy hours. I enjoy seeing the fresh flowers on each table and the balloons for the little ones. 

What I love about chick fil a is that the staff isn't stingy with sauces which can be a pet peeve for most people who like different sauces or one sauce doesn't cut it for your whole meal. 

That leads me to the vast variety of sauces that chick fil a offers. The list is long and if you like a ting of spice I'd recommend trying the zesty buffalo! 

To finish, Chick fil a has the best ice cream swirl cones in the USA (in my opinion). Top your meal or treat yourself to a cold treat on a hot summer day with an ice cream cone please you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Friendly, nice, fast, clean, efficient, consistent. The manager and staff has always been great. If only all fast food could be this way. Y'all are awesome- thank you."}
{"text":"Beautiful store. Extremely clean, food was EXCELLENT!!!! Service was better than excellent!!! Hadn't been in in a year or so but never dissappoints!!!"}
{"text":"What a great establishment! The staff and serving is some of the best you'll get. I don't normally comment on fast food, but Don and Gloria were so kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"Look CFA, I'm a fan and have been since 2008 when I was shown the light at my first Chick-fil-a lunch in Evansville, IN. Food is consistently good, restaurants are always clean and staffed with (usually) high energy and over-the-top polite teenagers. I have recently discovered the Cobb Salad and for this I am grateful.

This location is no different than the standard greatness with the exception of the past 2 or 3 times we've been. All of a sudden, our orders have been incorrect or incomplete, and the drive thru takes 20+ minutes. They sometimes do that thing where they have two kids taking orders standing out in the drive thru lane. Hate to break it to you, this does not speed things up. Get it back together please!"}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I've ever eaten because it was nasty and burnt. And I asked for the Fry's and they were cooled and there was only like half of the frys in the box"}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly and really good fresh food. The fries were a bit  salty, but it was a great experience."}
{"text":"In my late hour of chicken needs chik Fila stayed open until exactly 10 pm and still let me in and took my order. These guys are super beasts at customer service."}
{"text":"This place is always busy it's crazy how busy they get but always manage to give you a great customer service and double check that your order is exactly what u wanted and always before you get your food they ask you if you need extra sauce napkins and if you hear of their specials I love that they double check everything and make sure your order is correct best service"}
{"text":"Yay! Finally we have a Chick-Fil-A. Very satisfied with their fast service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Normally I don't write review on fast food chain. But this Chick-fil-a does not make me feel I'm having fast food. Everyone know what Chick-fil-a tastes like. So I am not wasting your time. 

The restaurant is very clean and nice. They have a kid play area. The service is really good. They even take the food for you if it's not ready. The workers there are very energetic. Smile on the face does make the food taste a little bit better. I will go over there again"}
{"text":"Only been here twice, both times through the drive-through. The first time I went, they forgot my straw for my drink, and the Polynesian sauce even though I asked for it. I didn't complain, mistakes happen. My second visit, which is the reason I'm never going back, is because I was in the drive through lane (which there is of course a long line) waited in line for 15 minutes and at 10:30 on the dot, I ordered two chicken biscuits and told me \"we stopped serving breakfast at 10:30\" Seriously?? The person in front of me just ordered breakfast and I've been waiting for 15 minutes. She proceeds to tell me \"we are out of biscuits\" I ask her if I can at least get hash browns? Rudely answer: \"no, we aren't serving breakfast.\" It's one thing to deny me breakfast at 10:30 on the dot, after waiting for 15 minutes. But then to be rude and unapologetic, that is just unnecessary. So from now on my breakfast will be ordered from Cafe South or Steel Creek Diner and support our local businesses. Not some zombie staffed fast food chain."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Let me start by saying, I've been to chick-fil-a countless times in other states. Mainly Utah and Arizona. I originally was a huge fan. Not until I went to this location. 

My chicken sandwhich did not have the traditional chicken crispy texture. It was almost like they didn't cook the outer portion long enough. My chicken fingers were over-cooked and had a distinct burnt flavor. Part of my order was also incorrect. 

I give them 2 stars because I mobile ordered and it saved me the hassle of the drive-through. I would not revisit this location."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing! They never cease to amaze me even more...there was a police officer in front me if and they gave him a discount.  What a wonderful pilar in our community! Love this place even more!"}
{"text":"I wanna say chick fil a is the best fast food burger place you can go to! And they don't even sell burgers! My wife and I always get the same thing, spicy chicken sandwich combo, upgrade your waffle fries to a large (it's only like $0.45 more) and a large sweet tea! I lived off of chick fil a in college and I always seem to be craving it from time to time!

When I see people loving \"Raising Cane's\", I'm always like \"why don't people just get chick fil a?\" It's seriously better than it's other chicken restaurants AND the sauces is what makes this place so great! The normal chick fil a sauce and honey mustard are my faves while I also like to get the Polynesian and normal bbq sauces too! 

The desserts at chick fil are great too! Ice cream is good! Milkshakes are sooooo bomb! Always get the peach milkshake when it's available or the cookies n cream milkshake! 

However the best thing about chick fil a"}
{"text":"Good food that you would expect from chick fil A. That staff is mostly friendly until it gets really busy, this is so sad to say but I've actually had some bad experiences with this chick fil a. Once I did curbside pick up, and forgot so I waited inside the restaurant. When I told them about my mistake, instead of them just handing them my food, they said I had to go outside where curbside pick up is at and pick up my order there. Very odd. 

Another time they wouldn't let me refill my drink even though I showed my receipt and that my order was purchased literally 30 minutes ago. They said because I initially left the store, I'm not allowed any more refills. 

Those were only two of my problems at this one. The lines can get really long since they're right next to ASU so all the college students come here for lunch, but that's not really their problem. Overall the food is as expected, good for fast food. 

What makes chick fil a different from other fast food restaurants is their service, and I'm sad to say that it's hit or miss."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The staff always seems to be polite and considerate.  Food is awesome!  I saw that someone posted \"The Ugly - Closed Sunday.\"  I always respected CFA for not being opened on Sundays.  It's a well sought-after day off in hospitality and gives their employees a chance to relax on a special day of the week with their friends and family.  Maybe that's why the customer service is so good?  Just saying..."}
{"text":"This place has the lunch rush hour for drive thru down! Very impressed. The food is high quality for fast food. Cool chicken wrap is awesome with the avacado ranch. Actually a healthy fast food option that doesn't taste like crap."}
{"text":"Wow!!! That's all I'm going to say!!! You MUST visit this place! The food tastes INCREDIBLE!!! I Love their Spicy deluxe chicken!!! With pepper jack cheese! You can't go wrong with anything in their menu. I'm a super fit and healthy person and I have to tell you, if I could... I'd eat this daily! It's that amazing!!! Add to that their never failing customer service and it just makes for an awesome place and experience! Enjoy :-)

P.S.
Get their mobile app and order that way.  You won't regret it! We just went to their opening night and it took 35 minutes (worth the wait and it's not just hype).  There were people who were STILL in line waiting to order and we had already finished eating."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location and it was a great experience! My food was peeeerfect, warm, and so delicious. I had the breakfast egg white sandwich with tots and coffee. The employees were so nice! I love Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A restaurants strictly enforce their employees to uphold 100% customer service, with positive attitude. 

On our visit, it was very clear the cashier HATED his job. When asking for refill he would sigh or when taking our (and the people in front of us) orders, he would look to the floor or out the window as if he cannot wait till his shift was over...

To perfectly describe the cashier, would be the \"Dry Eye Guy.\"

Not to mention food was cold and the cashier made everything feel worse/uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Honestly not that impressed overall! It was nice that I didn't have to wait long in the drive thru compared to the people in line."}
{"text":"Visited this location about a week ago. I ordered a large fry and a veggie wrap. Fries were fantastic as always but the ingredients in my wrap (black beans and corn, etc.) were completely frozen. I suppose I should have known they used frozen veggies, but this was news to me. It was completely inedible and I ended up just eating the wrap, with the lettuce dipped in sauce. Pretty disappointing, especially for $8"}
{"text":"This Chic  is great. I am there every morning with my dogs as the are huge  fans. If we don't go I have one that will pout all day. Of course, we always use the drive through and are always handled efficiently. For the most part the line moves rather quickly although you can always tell when one person is on one of the lanes as she is extremely slow. I cannot say anything bad about this restaurant. Thank you for your friendly service and great selections."}
{"text":"Food is great as always. Wish I could say the same for the cashier Mandi. She didn't smile the whole interaction and she didn't seem interested or vested in the conversation I tried to had. I'm unsure if she's having a hard time, but I wish she didn't behave the way she did."}
{"text":"This was my first Chick-Fil-A after hearing so many good things about it. The nearest one back in California is 30 miles away. While I was in Charlotte, I knew I had to try it before I left. The one I went to was inside a corporate building. The speed at which the workforce moved was so fast, reminded me of an auto manufacturer.

I ended up getting:
- The Ultimate Sandwich
- Chicken Nuggets
- Waffle Fries

It was ready in about 1 min. This place probably has the best fast food chicken sandwiches, but I'm not too big of a fan of their chicken nuggets. I still prefer McDonald's with the golden crispy outside. However, their waffle fries def are one of the better fries I've had compared to other fast food places. This place was super cheap and super fast. Great if you're in a hurry or want a quick snack.

I got to add that the customer service was fantastic. There was someone walking around who personally asked me if I would like a refill on my drink or if she can get me anything. Where can you find that at a fast food joint?

I hope someone opens one up near San Francisco. I would definitely be a regular customer there."}
{"text":"Perhaps because we don't have this anywhere near home, they always seem good to me.
I love the ice cream.

I wish the other fast food chains would take not and train their staff to care about the customers the way they do at Chick - fil - A"}
{"text":"One of the fastest Chick-fil-a's i've been to! Tasty as always of course. There were only a couple times out of the many that my order was incorrect, but they fixed it right away no problem. I think that almost all of the stores have great employees but they seem extra friendly here!"}
{"text":"I don't do fast food very much anymore, but I stopped here over the weekend to show Chick-Fil-A some love for standing by their morals.  I was in the area to visit another store, and made sure to stop here for lunch! 

The employees here are very friendly and helpful, as they are at every CFA I've been to. If you're unfamiliar with their menu, they have breakfast from open to 10:30 - the awesome CFA biscuit, and bacon-egg-cheese, and others. My favorite items on the rest of their menu is the regular CFA sandwich and the spicy chicken wrap...I get them with fruit cups instead of fries, and their great sweet tea. Yum! This is a treat, not a regular thing for me, but I'm glad to support them. 

This location is at the corner of Tatum and Cactus, on the SEC, in the same area as the Wal-Mart and Michael's."}
{"text":"First I must say I am a Chick-Fila fan. When it comes to this particular location I can only get their breakfast. I have tried their non-breakfast menu atleast twice ordering the standard chicken sandwich with DISSATISFACTION. 

*TWICE I was given a sandwich with an unusually small piece of chicken with hardly no breading. After waiting in the drive thru FOREVER during lunch hours.*

The first time I gave them the benefit of the doubt thinking this is a rare occurence and went back. The second time I opened my sandwich and saw that little uncrispy piece of chicken I was done. I wasted my time and money NEVER AGAIN. 

I rather drive further to Belmont where I always get what i pay for and the lines move faster."}
{"text":"This place has great food. The staff keeps it very clean, which is amazing because it's crazy crazy busy at lunch. It's like a giant daycare center. Every stay at home mom is in here with their babies and toddlers during lunch every single weekday. It's great they have a play area for the children but if you are looking for some quiet time on your lunch time, this is not the place for you. Come in the evenings instead. Still love it!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The staff is amazing. As I sat there eating my dinner and watching they interact with all the customers I was so impressed.. Everyone had a smile on there face. I will be back for sure. It is a breath of fresh air to see that business still embrace  the value for good customer service. A++"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend are not huge fans of fast food at all. But I must say at this location the customer service and management is so friendly here. If your ever having a bad day just come here to eat and by the time you leave there team will put a smile on your face"}
{"text":"Yikes. Stopped by the drive-thru at lunch and ordered a nugget meal with a coke and chick fil a sauce. The cashier repeated my request for chick fil a sauce and after handing me my bag closed the window and forgot my coke. After I waited and reminded her she handed it to me. After leaving I realized there was no chick fil a sauce in the bag (which I definitely needed since there wasn't a pinch of salt on the fries). I drove back to chick fil a and waited a few minutes to be able to catch an employee and ask for sauce. After finally being able to enjoy my semi-cold meal I found a nugget made almost entirely of cartilage. No thanks."}
{"text":"About 12 years ago, I was working with a business consultant from Atlanta.  She told me that Chick Fila was a potential client.  I said.... What is his name?  And, what business is he in?  I had no idea that Chick-Fil-A was a restaurant serving chicken.  I thought it was a persons name.

So far, I have been to Chick Fil-A twice.  Once at a grand opening in St. George, and once now here in AZ.  I give it a solid 3.5, so it rounds up to a 4 star.

The good -  Well, chicken, chicken salads, chicken wraps and chicken type burgers.  Plenty of sauce.  Like the calories listed on the menu, great pricing. Decent tasting product.  Great staff, management and customer service.

The bad - Nothing really bad, But, they have all the unhealthy choices here like milk shakes, soft ice creams, tons of sauces and the like. I always find it funny to see someone ordering a complete meal, a shake and washing it down with a diet coke.... Otherwise, choices are all your's.

The end result - Overall, the place is pretty good, I am NOT a fan of fast foods in general and Chick-Fil-A is no exception.  However, besides, Raising Cane, I find that the stuff here is pretty decent!


GK says, check it out."}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A.

Great customer service, killer FAST food and a really great business model. ALL of their competitors should study them and copy their model... You are all doing it wrong.... Except In and Out."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time recently! Took awhile, but I never felt like waiting in the long lines when I drove by. But I have to say, I really enjoyed the spicy delux chicken sandwich! The chicken was crispy, but tender and juicy inside. The waffle fries are great. I like all the different options for sauces. My favorites were the garlic ranch, the sriracha sauce, the Polynesian sauce and the chick-fil-a sauce (which is hard to describe, kind of like a cheesy bbq tasting sauce). They definitely have the best lemonade-freshly made and tart. We also tried the nuggets. They were good but didn't blow me away. I'm not a big nugget person to begin with, just got them because everyone was recommending them. I do look forward to going back on a hot summer afternoon to get one of their shakes or frozen lemonade."}
{"text":"I go to this Chick-fil-a pretty frequently and my order is almost always correct. I went through the drive thru a few weeks ago and got somebody else's order but it wasn't until I was already home that I realized. I wrote to corporate and about a week and a half later they sent an apology letter along with a free entree coupon. Not even a week later, I received another letter from the Chapel Hill store manager himself personally apologizing for the mix up with TWO more coupons. This store always goes above and beyond with their customer service and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"The service is superb! I never wait more than 3 minutes tops to get my food and it's centrally located. I will say it's a bit pricey but the food is so good, it evens out. They should have a chain in New York! All and all, I love this place."}
{"text":"Haven't had a Chick-fil-A since 1984 as I just haven't been near one.   
As good as I remember!!!!

This location?  Nice staff and very clean."}
{"text":"Slow service,
We call in orders to go every week for our company. Each week the service gets slower and slower. We were told 10 minutes for pick up,  I waited for 25 minutes are getting to the location to pick up our order. After waiting in a long line to let them know I was there I had to move to a different cashier because they do all the pick up orders. Disorganized is an understatement of this facility."}
{"text":"As always, they were spot on with my lunch order today.  Even when the line is wrapped around the building, orders are filled FAST!! This location makes sure the customers' orders are filled CORRECTLY.  I'd rank their customer service a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10 - even better than most CFAs that I visit around the Charlotte area.  They are beyond wonderful and they remember your name!  I've ordered large complicated catering orders and they've nailed it EACH and EVERY time!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE CFA, dislike this location A LOT!! I was so excited when they built this location, as it's close to where I live.  Excitement has been short-lived and although I've given them additional chances, issues continue.  Fast food experiences should not be this complicated.  

Getting in and out of this parking lot is a nightmare.  There's one way in and one out.  Traffic backs up to South Blvd during most hours of the day, from the drive thru lane and customers. Having someone in the parking lot taking orders does not speed up this drive thru window.  The Drive-thru line is so SUPER slow! 

If you think you're being smart by going inside, it too is a madhouse! This location just isn't prepared to handle the volume of customers that it attracts.  

Parking lot is another roller coast that one should be prepared to deal with.  As my visit today will show you, multiple people have created their own parking spots since the parking lot was full.  Another KIND customer parked directly behind my car, keeping me from leaving because they had blocked me in!! 

TIP!! Double check your order before you leave.  I've often gotten home and been missing portions of my order- only to have to drive back and deal with said obstacles above, again! 

SECOND TIP!! Do yourself a favor, if you're really craving CFA, drive to the Woodlawn Location.  Your CFA experience will be much better there. 

Three stars because their quality of food is ...well, CFA good but even their condiment station needed help today.  It was dirty with spilled creamer, sugar and empty napkins holders.  I can expect that at McD but not CFA!  Good luck getting attention from an employee, they're all busy trying to fill orders!"}
{"text":"So used to go to Chick-fil-A all the time in the morning to get a good delicious chicken sandwich now all of them have switched to 10:30 here I am it's 10:20 and I can't get a chicken sandwich they can fry up chicken nuggets and all their breakfast chicken sandwiches but they can't make a chicken sandwich so disappointed that the owner would operate this business this way what about all the people that go to work early and breakfast time is there lunch I guess those people don't matter to these businesses anymore looks like Burger King is the only one that cares too bad their food sucks"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is a great restaurant.  The staff is always friendly and courteous.  I always get great food here.  I've always had a great experience!!  In the words of their employees, it is my pleasure to write a 5 STAR review!!!"}
{"text":"We just had a catered lunch from here for over 200 people. They set up, they served, they cleaned up. Nothing to do for us by watch our associates chow down. 

Each person received a chicken sandwich, bag of chips, cookie, and...a card for a free breakfast sandwich! Is that cool or what!

The group had all positive comments about the catered lunch. There's nothing I would change."}
{"text":"Not a real Chick-Fil-A.  A real Chick-Fil-A would NOT shut down their ice cream machine at 8:45. Truett would be disappointed in the management at this kiosk location.  And based on my check in from June 2013 this is not an isolated incident."}
{"text":"The first fast food place I've been to with legitimately healthy options!"}
{"text":"The service was OK. The food wasn't. Not sure what's going on here, ie. if this particular place dropped the ball or if the problem is further upstream.

There are other restaurants in this area which definitely are less bland."}
{"text":"Great food and fast friendly service.  Try the Grilled Chicken Club.  It is so juicy no condiments are needed."}
{"text":"Bravo on your amazing Team, from placing my order, checking for accuracy before handing it over, to a beautifully crafted absolutely freshly cooked sandwich that was just impressive from first bite to the last! 
Thank you"}
{"text":"There's always a line at the drive through during peak lunch and dinner hours. That's not their fault but the staff is so awesome. They are super friendly and they have never messed up my order once in 16 months. Super friendly staff, service and great food."}
{"text":"While this Chick-fil- A location has made a lot of changes to better serve you, sitting on the road (Randolph Rd that is ) for 10 minuets just to get in is not the best feeling. Traffic backs up real bad, as a matter of fact all the way to Sharon Amity from what I can see. Then you place your order, pull around I double check with the lady before the window to make sure my order is right she say's \"yes\", they I pull up to the window get my food and drive back to where I am going to. Once I get there I unpack my food to see that there is no salad dressing (keep in mind I have asked and double check). I feel like every timeI go to this location if I use the drive thur something is always missing from my lunch. Needless to say this should not be happening as you pay a premium for the food. I guess I will have to drive out of my way from now on to the Park Rd location as I have never had any problems with this location ever... not sure what Park Rd does different but maybe you guys need to go visit to see how they get the orders right every time!!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly a quick service. The food is good and reasonably priced. The strawberry shake was delicious.  I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to get a negative review. Management at this place needs to get with it or fired. Worst service in the history of the world."}
{"text":"I love chic fil a! The service here is always great when I dine in. Someone is always walking around to ask if I need a refill and if I need any trash taken away. You don't really get that service as a fast food chain! 
Also download the App on your phone. They are always uploading free treats and every time you purchase an item have them scan your app which gets you closer to free items!"}
{"text":"Super busy on a Friday night of course that is expected. So they have someone standing outside waiting with an iPad to take orders ahead of time. I asked to see the menu on hand because my nieces have never had chick fil a before. My niece order the 2 piece chicken strips with a hand spun milk shake. I then ordered my meal the #1 & #3. And he gave us our total. He left and I realized he never even asked me if my niece wanted fruit or waffle fries with her meal?!  Now we are stuck here waiting in a very long line and he is way behind lost in a pile of cars taking orders outside. So now I have to tell the workers who are gonna hand me the food when I pull up what she wants with her meal because he guessed it for her. And let me tell you my niece is picky"}
{"text":"Hands down best customer service I've ever experienced. They go above and beyond to make sure you're happy. Food came out right hot as I was sitting down. Taff and Arleen were truly amazing, extremely helpful and friendly. I will be back again because of them. Thanks!"}
{"text":"First time I've had CFA since being here in Charlotte!  Not sure how it escaped me, but glad I finally got around to it.  Great service and really good food.  Not the most exciting place to write about.

Hit the drive-thru during breakfast hours and the sausage burrito & spicy chicken biscuit did not disappoint. Fan4life.

dmo out."}
{"text":"A few of your employees could use attitude adjustments. One was clearly not listening to our order, one got sarcastic with filling my cup with ice. I typically have a lot of patience with restaurants, this just felt purposefully rude."}
{"text":"Love this place. It is one of my favorite lunch destinations. The staff is always sweet to the point it almost hurts your teeth! You can tell customer service is a top priority. My only complaint is that they have the slowest drive thru in the world. Once sat for 26 minutes in the drive-thru. You can't exactly leave it is taking too long either. I gotta say the food is so good though it is worth the wait. Try the honey roasted BBQ. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Haven't been inside of this location yet, but have been through the drive thru several times. 

I initially thought it was a very strange set up, as I am used to the ones in Cali. You pull up to one of the two lines, and a person comes up to your car to take your order. The first time I went, the girl asked what she could get for me. I hadn't been in a long time, and needed to see a menu, as my car was several cars away from the menu board. She got a little irritated. That threw me off, like really? Anyway, you order, then wait to go in order in to one merged line to pay. Then pick up your food at the window. 

So far, other than the attitude with the first girl, and me being called Melvin by another person, it's been very efficient. The lines look long, but they go quick, and my order has been spot on every time."}
{"text":"I have nothing but praises to sing Chick-fil-a.  This airport location was a great surprise on my way out of town.  I got through the line of CFA fans quickly and the turnaround time for food was also quite quick.  Service was great, everyone was so friendly.  There's also a nice little food court area where there is plenty of seating and large windows so you don't feel like you're in a bomb shelter like the rest of CLE airport."}
{"text":"You'll find the high standards of Chick-fil-a here!! Excellent service and good, clean food. Like the community involvement they are known for and do!!"}
{"text":"To start, I\"m a huge fan of most Chic-fil-A but this visit was pathetic. Food was great and so was the friendly service. My complaint is with the cleanliness.

We order and went to sit down and every single booth and table was sticky or dirty. Not to mention the trash was over-flowing out of of it's container. Whoever the General Manager is should be fired and show should the employees for not keeping the place clean for paying customers.

Like I said, great food and service but this particular Chick-fil-A is filthy. Clean the damn tables and have someone take out the trash."}
{"text":"DO NOT USE THE MOBILE APP!!!!
This place opened up a few months and had been busy. So I decided to use mobile app to save time. The opposite happened.

Ordered at 8:35 pm some chicken nuggets and waffle fries. Got there at 9pm and used the check in app. Then then app said a team member is preparing your order. Then I waited.

At 9:15 pm asked the cashier about it and said to just wait it was being made. Keep I mind their was no one in line when I got there. 

At 9:25 pm asked a different person. He said that the app is kind of glitchy, and to wait.

Finally at 9:45 pm, after seeing multiple people wait in line order and get their food, which were larger orders and multiple bags...I was like what's up????

Then a manager came by, said they never received the order. So he rung my order up and told me to wait.

Just before closing I left with my order...1 hour and 25 minutes after my original order.

By the way, no one offered me a drink, or comped anything. Even though I didn't get upset, I was pretty patient in the hopes that Chik fi la would do the right thing.

Unfortunately, it did not happen. I'm hoping this is not representative of the values this organization was built upon. The founder would be disappointed.

Good food. Poor customer service. Horrible mobile app."}
{"text":"I frequent the drive thru more than going inside.  The drive thru is sooooo slow.  I hate coming to this location because of it. 

The employees have always been friendly and the food good.  

If you are looking to get in and out by using the drive thru, pass or go inside."}
{"text":"Consistently great service and food.  

I frequent here for breakfast by going inside.  Only down side is it's always cold inside.  

The owner of the establishment is always full of energy and positive.   Almost makes me want to get a part time job here. 

They offer breakfast biscuits, burritos, bagels, parfaits and breakfast platters just to name a few.   

There are plenty of healthy options for lunch too.  Grilled chicken, salads and fruit."}
{"text":"When I am in the area I always go to this establishment.  

They are always thorough, fast, clean and friendly.  Food is always fast and hot. 

Consistent service whether in the drive thru or going inside.

Best Chick-fil-A in the city."}
{"text":"I never understood all the hype on Chick-Fil-A, until my experience with this particular location. The team here demonstrates exceptional customer service- always going above and beyond to make it anything but a transactional environment. The food is always fresh, and the smiles are always genuine. Chick-Fil-A is the only fast food restaurant I frequent, and their effort to foster family values throughout the community does not go unnoticed."}
{"text":"Here now 6/30/2018 line wrapped around building so decided to lark and go in. I love this place but its expensive so l dont come very often as l would like."}
{"text":"Food, as per any Chick-fil-A, was TOP NOTCH. I am not being facetious. I can't get enough Chick-fil-A. The restaurant was clean, kids play area well maintained and the staff was incredibly cordial and welcoming. Only downside was that they forgot to give a drink and an entire kids meal with our order. They rectified the situation quickly, but it wasn't incredibly busy. Mistakes happen!!

I'll be back at least eleventy billion times (great saturday night live jeopardy skit, go check it out)"}
{"text":"They made our short visit wonderful by singing Happy Birthday to Carol! Great team and wonderful humbling staff! Love them!"}
{"text":"Service at this specific location was absolutely terrible. Not helpful, not friendly, and after 30 minutes of waiting for food I had to ask the staff what was going on. Not only were they unapologetic, but almost seemed bothered that I was asking. The parking lot is terribly positioned and seemingly always congested. I will never be visiting this specific location again"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect of a CFA in a hospital, but it was busy. The staff was decently friendly (not overly unfriendly as one expects at CFA). 
They got our order wrong, but quickly corrected it.

It could use a little more frequent cleaning, but I know they stay busy. 

Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"Overall they're the normal fast food joint..  In my last couple stops however my chicken nuggets have been puny.  Just check them before driving off or you'll basically feel a little cheated"}
{"text":"so i went on this diet recently while visiting family in charlotte. three chick-fil-a sandwiches a day. 

i had a grand old time getting porked up while still being skinny by comparison (honestly, charlotte, you're not all that fat as american cities go. seattle is just a really skinny bitch). i am also quite sure i would not have survived sudden family overload and korean aunts' pinching of my recently acquired muffin top if it weren't for the euphoria caused by constant consumption of these crack-laced chickens. and eight out of ten friends agreed i was much less of an asshole. 

fuck prozac. eat mor chikin. 

*my reviews are useful*

- new spicy chicken? not so spicy and too salty. stick to the original.
- freshly squeezed lemonade! get half-lemonade, half-iced tea. one of the few drinks under 80 proof worth my time and calories. 
- dip your waffle fries in ketchup AND mayo. mm mm mm. 
- every location i've been to is eat-off-the-floor-clean and the staff christian-youth-club-nice. slightly creepy now that i think about it. 
- CLOSED SUNDAYS"}
{"text":"Only came for a small ice cream cone through the drive thru. The KID (literally looked like a 12 year old) gave me a cone that had ice cream smaller than a kids size and it was double wrapped  so I couldn't get the bottom cone out. Dang Chick Fil A..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the BBQ Bacon Sandwich here is the best Chick Fil-A sandwich I've ever had! Perfectly cooked bacon on top of a juicy grilled chicken breast. 

Paired with some amazing bbq sauce and jack cheese this beauty was one of the best sandwiches ever to be in me mouth! The chicken was seasoned with what seemed like lemon pepper and had me wanting more.

Thanks Chick Fil-A for making me look at fast food differently. (This location is more fancy and has family style meal option like mac n cheese and bbq beans that I haven't seen anywhere else)"}
{"text":"Despite people are very courteous as always (all chick filas staff are extremely courteous) in this Northlake loc nobody was attempting to serve me until I brought it to their attention. I suggest managers train employees."}
{"text":"Now fast food really shouldn't receive reviews but this place is so friendly with good, hot food!  Once I waited in line for a good while and received a free 3 piece chicken fingers and the manager apologized.  I was not upset but I am 24 and most people do not care about the younger crowd and only cater to older individuals...so I was very grateful."}
{"text":"Placed my order in the drive through, it was very fast for the amount of cars, ordered spicy chicken deluxe. I drove about 8 min back to my house to eat it and it was delicious. I will go back."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm reviewing @ChickfilA, but with good reason.

Marissa worked the counter today, and epitomized service with a smile!

She delivered our food to the table, and even asked if we needed refills on our drinks.

She was one of the friendliest people I've ever encountered at a fast food restaurant, and should be praised by her employer.

The food is pretty good, and I would probably go to Chik fil-A before KFC.

But I just want to rave about the service."}
{"text":"Very much the highlight of our trip to the mall. The staff is amazingly friendly and outgoing. I look forward to visiting them at their stand alone location on McKnight in the coming months! (More convenient)"}
{"text":"Clean and bright location with pleasant employees. Love the soundproof playroom, as you can be sitting right next to it and not hear a thing! Glad to finally have a standalone location in the North Hills area.

There's two ways to get into this location. It's recommended to use the entrance at Bed, Bath, and Beyond directly across from the northernmost Ross Park Mall entrance. It's sort of easy to miss the next entrance going south on McKnight. It's just past the BBB light, and it shares the entrance with another building. There are separate lanes for parking, and drive through only so keep your eyes open otherwise you'll be circling, and circling!

They have their standard menu offerings (chicken sandwiches, wrap, kids food), but I struggled to find a non-deluxe spicy chicken sandwich. I got the deluxe, and the pepperjack had a nice a kick which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is awesome, but this is the worst location I've ever been to. Before moving to AZ, I used to eat at a CFA at least once a week, now it's a rare occasion since this is the nearest location to my house and I'm always disappointed in the service. The young cashiers are friendly enough, but CFA is supposed to be fast food, and orders are never filled at the counter. Even the basics, a sandwich and fries, always involve a wait. I don't even think it's a quest for fresh food, it feels to me like the manager is too concerned with waste more than service. 

Lastly, don't bother with the text message program, unless you have kids. Most of the messages were invitations to have kids come to family night or dress up. And the one time it was a good coupon, one of the managers yelled at me in the drive-thru about accepting it.

Go to the location on Power & Ray, and you will get the CFA Experience you expect."}
{"text":"Eh it was ok, not as amazing as everyone tells me it is. When I lived in Vegas everyone would say if Chick-Fil-A was here Raisin Cane's would be put to shame...HAHAHA yeah right! I am glad I tried this now because nothing here stacks up to it. The Chicken was really solid could tell it was fresh cut before fried. But it just was lacking in flavor. The sauce was not inspiring but OK. ( I did take 8 packs home to Seattle with me) But it was nothing like the Canes sauce. The Sweet Tea was even disappointing vs Raising Canes. Overall compared to other fast foods it is better than most. But, I only eat fast food if it is outstanding and this was not it."}
{"text":"Great customer service and high quality, delicious food every time. There was a line wrapped around the building and I waited no more than 3 minutes after ordering to get my food. They had a young man outside taking orders which made the ordering process smooth and very efficient. Good job Chik Fil A!"}
{"text":"Can always count on Chick-fil-A for consistency in taste and good service.
Grabbed a cookies and cream milkshake from here, and it was really good - as usual!
Me and a friend even gave the play-place a testing because it was late (playplace closed) so we did a quick race through it. LOL"}
{"text":"Love this place. Such friendly people.   Amazing customer service.  They never mess up an order.  They even went above and beyond and brought nuggets and sauce to our work at CVS on 4th of July saying Thank you for working the holiday.  I can't say enough great things about this place and the people who work here.  Always such an amazing pleasure to go.  Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Chick-Fil-A I have ever been to. I walked up to order food and a Chick-Fil-A customer informed me that you had to stand in a particular spot and then wave, in order for them to take your order. She then proceeded to tell me that the cashiers held a converstation for 5 minutes before helping her. That is exactly what took place when I walked up. When I walked up, I asked for assistance. When I asked for the assitance, the cashier looked at me as if I was bothering her. She finally took my order. When I was waiting for my food, I asked another cashier to top-off my drink. She rolled her eyes and filled my cup up so high to the point that it was pouring out of the cup. I said to her this is too high and could we please pour some of it out. She looked at me crazy, so I reached over and poured it out myself. She said in a very rude manner, \" I mean did you want a napkin or something?\" Huuuuuhhh yea. I can't lick it up. I have worked for Chick-Fil- A, so I know this is not the norm. 

I called corporate and they stated that the owner will contact us back. The owner never contacted us back, which is no suprise. This just shows what type of leadership they have. These employees need to go work at McDonalds because that type of attitude does not belong at Chick-Fil-A and it certainly doesn't belong in that type of neighborhood."}
{"text":"It would be nice to sometime to get a breakfast sandwich from this place that doesn't have raw bacon on it."}
{"text":"Giving them 4 stars because I've been to this location a countless number of times. I'm used to being greeted with a smile and hearing the world famous \"my pleasure,\" which brings joy to my soul. Well this morning, it was NOT the drive thru attendant's pleasure to be there. We drive up to the window and she doesn't say anything except what our total is. We asked for sauce and ketchup and she simply asked \"how many?\" We completed our transaction and she didn't bother to tell us to \"have a blessed day\" like I'm used to. I don't eat at McDonald's but that experience reminded me of the service one gets there, not the hospitable Chick-Fil-A. I'll continue to frequent this location because I'm positive I won't get that same treatment next time. She may have been having a rough morning so we won't hold it against her."}
{"text":"This is the 5th time I've been to a chik fil a and they are out of the soup...I had to ask for the sauce twice ...first time I asked she said they were out and she had to get more then had to go up and ask again and the kid grabbed it right away she was too lazy to look in the other spot at the next register. Don't advertise the soup if ur not going to have it"}
{"text":"I love this location....always great friendly customer service food is always good and fresh....if I had to complain about one thing....the last 3 times I been there they don't have any chicken soup.....I even paid stood there waiting and then they tell me no soup and that it wasn't stocked since lunch...but it's excellent soup just wish they stocked it more"}
{"text":"2 super packed lanes of drive through we're a sign that this location finally opened. 
It was super busy! Drive through lanes and always inside the restaurant was completely packed. 

The sandwiches were good! Good tasty chicken! 
But honestly what needs to be addressed here is the service and professionalism of the staff! 

Clearly who ever opened this location knew what they're doing. It was extremely busy, and yet you didn't feel it with the service. Full staff working, super friendly, quick, professional and one of the best services I got at a fast food chain. 

Great experience overall! the food was yummy, but I didn't have enough to determine is it was amazing! 

Overall I love the experience!!
Trust me, I know food!"}
{"text":"Thank you for knowing me by name.
Maggie and the Manager deserve 5 stars, the rest of the staff as well, 5 stars.

Kids play area is indoor and thank you for that as well.
Please add/enforce \"age\" restriction and \"no spitting at other kids\" if possible.

Food is pricey compared to cheaper chains but it is TASTY. YUMM!!!!

Everytime i think of this place, I think of the staff being nice to me and especially to kids, my kids and all kids.

The staff makes me want to go to the chickfilet.

They are really really really professional and nice.

4 stars for the restaurant but the staff is why i am giving it 5."}
{"text":"This location has the cleanest dining room and bathrooms. It also is the most customer oriented of all the Chik Fil A I have been to. They seem to care about your satisfaction."}
{"text":"Plan on waiting 900000000000 minutes for drive thru haha. All the Sunday's off to brainstorm, you'd think the higher ups would figure out a way to have 120 high school kids on the clock AND reduce the wait. #istillhavehope"}
{"text":"fast. everything you've come to expect from the place..
nice people and the food is always hot."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A, but I will not go to this one again because of poor customer service. I have ordered trays from this specific location twice. The first time they lost my order and the 2nd time they had my order wrong and didn't even bother to apologise.  My favorite Chick-fil-A with the best customer service is at the one on Gilbert and the Santan 202 (thankful this is also closer to me!)."}
{"text":"The cashier was such in a rush that he messed up the order as if he wanted to go home. What you get when you want to order a Spicy Chicken Deluxe Combo. Got our drink orders wrong as well. Didn't even apologize for the mess up! Good Luck with bad service!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and a very popular spot on South Blvd. They feature the normal CFA cuisine, which is a very good thing. The management is very generous with supporting charities and the staff is very friendly on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"Edible! Not quite Bojangles or KFC! About the same type of fried chicken.

Bojangles-better biscuits
KFC-better cole slaw"}
{"text":"I love coming here because the service is so fast specially during lunch time. They have never made a mistake on my orders and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience ever.  The manager Jennifer is rude, demeaning, to he honest a flat out liar.  I will never visit this location again and will make sure to spread the word.  On Friday I went thru drive thru and ordered a grilled chicken  sandwich on gluten free bread. I thinks it's a # 5. As I'm driving home trying to assemble the sand which I come to find Out that they didn't give me any chicken....... how is this possible.  It's the core item.  ( I work in the food industry, it totally happens.  No big deal.). I called and spoke with a guy.  He asked if I had the receipt. I said no.  He said. Come back and we will replace it. Cool. Works for me.  Stuff happens.  So today I go to get lunch. The order taker in drive thru was cluesless.  Completely clueless. I told her what happened and right away she said well I can't help you have to speak to my manager. It's $12.  I'm not gonna fight over $12. I said. Never mind I'll order and I'll pay. So I Try And place my order.  For 5 mins she stumbles thru the process.  Asking a million times over and over.  Why is she taking orders if she can't listen.  Ok so I made it to the window where an assistant manager was waiting. I attempted to hand him my card and explain my frustration. It was a joke.  The gm was so extremely unprofessional. She is hiding in the corner starts screaming something. What kind of an establishment is this.   You messed up my food, couldn't take an order, and I'm in the wrong???  When I call to try and complain Jennifer refuses to provide any way to communicate to his upper management.  She needs replaced. What a terrible representation of ur brand. She is accusatory, unhelpful, rude. I was happy to pay for my lunch today again.  I couldn't even get that. - still hungry"}
{"text":"Shout out to Tyler for amazing customer service! Very clean location and the food was great as well. Will be coming here again next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Usually you receive outstanding customer service , but this location lacks smiles, customer satisfaction must not have been in their training guide. The manager was worthless too. Bunch of high school kids standing and chatting instead of serving and working .

I must say the morning staff is so much nicer than the evening, that's because they are adults... Imagine that

Will I ever be able to leave a decent review on this location,  the world will never know , think I choked on a stalk from the \"Kale salad\" one of the power sides options .

8/18/2016

This location has improved on service and their attention to their meals . Keep it up because my kids love it here ."}
{"text":"If I had to choose one food to eat for the rest of my life, it would be their waffles fries (from this location as well). Yes, yes we all know Chick-Fil-A is a chain and thus all the food is supposed to be the same. However, what sets the other locations apart from this one would be the service. Everyone here has such a smile on their face while they take your order. They are so welcoming and even recognizes you if you're a regular (some days I order food for my parents and drop it off at their place and then come back later to get food for myself and the workers welcome me with a welcome back). 

Not only is service is good but cleanliness is also very important to me. This location is very sanitary and every table is spotless. I always return to this location even if I'm on the other side of town and there's another Chick-Fil-A closer to me."}
{"text":"I always grab a strawberry milkshake for my wife here when I go to In & Out burger. I do like their chicken sandwich and I LOVE their Polynesian sauce! I try to stick up on the Polynesian sauce for other things I like to use it on. The only problem is that it's cover cracks and you get a sticky orange mess everywhere."}
{"text":"Hello friends,

Short & Sweet. I have to give it up for this chain. It seems no matter which location they ALL provide the same service. Consistency is something that's always strived for but not always obtain. (Especially GOOD consistency) 

No matter which location, the service is fresh, fast,  friendly, correct & hot.

One thing that grinds my gears is that asking for a name as if I'm not standing 6feet away. But even that's no biggy.

Go enjoy,

{"text":"Hello friends,

I love this location. During the week they may have ol timers bingo night. They seem to be involved in the community. Always a young smiling face ready to take your order it give a refill. I didn't catch the manager on duty name,but he was very inviting. Sparked a quick conversation about the rain (all while doing sweeping & wiping down tables).
 
I always go on the inside unless I'm in a super hurry.

{"text":"Hello friends,

Short and sweet. Its a Fast Food chain. This location is ...wait.... get this..... FAST!! 

They had a line when I pulled up, so I parked and went in. Ordered and left. People were cleaning up floors, windows etc. when I was walking out!! 

Fast food Fast... now ain't that something!!!

{"text":"So happy to have my Chick-fil-A!

It's so comforting knowing I can drive 20 minutes away to come get my waffles fries and nuggets. It sucked always having to go to Utah or California for my fix!

Everyone is super friendly here. I decided to get take out inside since the drive thru line is always packed! It only took about 6 minutes just by walking inside. They gave us a extra sandwich and when I told the cashier they told me to keep it because they cannot take back food for health reasons. How awesome!!!!!!!! 

Clean and beautiful location. Haven't been skimped on, on the sauces. Food is always fresh and hot. The employees are also always smiling which is a plus because that means they love what they do/ love their job!"}

When the opportunity comes around to eat out, 4 out of 5 times, we head to Chick fil A!  I also have 3 daughters that have worked there, or are currently working there, and it is the greatest job any teenager could possibly want!  It is just \"good for you food\", and a great place to go!"}

{"text":"This is how fast food *should* be: spotless facility, exemplary customer service, and delicious chicken nuggets in mah belly."}
{"text":"They have screwed up several orders and one order was missing a sandwich...so instead of inviting me back in right away to get the sandwich, they sent me a coupon for a cheaper sandwich.  Not too happy.  9/23/16: Changed my review from two stars to three stars.  When they get different lids for the milkshakes that frequently spill because the lids do not always stay on, I will post a better review.  I have spilled several milkshakes because the employees evidently have a hard time snapping the lids on.  On the upside, the food is very good and I have yet to find an icky surprise in anything I have ordered to date."}
{"text":"This place tonite was very understaffed, I go here allot and never seen such a lack of employees, they had a hard time giving the. Usual chick-fil-a service that I usually get here"}
{"text":"My husband eats here for lunch every day.  Every. Single. Day.  I don't know how he does it, but he does.    My oldest son loves it, too.  My youngest just digs their vanilla shakes.  Service is always top notch.  That is one of their pride points.  They do a remarkable job handling the lunch and dinner rushes considering how many people come through the drive through.  SO many cars.  They are especially busy on Saturdays because they are closed on Sundays.  Prepare yourself for the madness!  They are pricey compared to most fast food chains, but you are paying for quality products.  It's a trade off.  They do offer all military service members a discount.  Kudos to you Chick-fil-A!  More companies should do the same.  All things considered, this is a solid Chick-fil-A and always a good experience."}
{"text":"We had catering/ delivery from Chick Fil A! First of all I was impressed with the service. The young man who delivered our food did a wonderful job, he placed everything on the table to include plates, utensil,mints and etc he brought along from the restaurant. Pricey, but very punctual and professional."}
{"text":"Expensive for a chicken sandwich! Does not have flavor even the soda was flat! Fries don't have any flavor as well. First and last time I eat chick-fil-A"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the flavor of Chick-Fil-A Chicken.  Although it is pricey,  it's well worth the cost.  I get excited everytime I see a new restaurant opening.  I'm not a iced tea drinker so I have never experienced any fungus in my beverage.  That does concern me but I will continue to enjoy their chicken.  Keep up the good work.  I also appreciate a business that stays true to their values over financial gain."}
{"text":"Girl screaming in kid pen, sounded like she was getting murdered. 
Got my order wrong, brought me some else's drink. 
All that was on my sandwich was a pickle and chicken...mmmmmm
Fries were overly salty."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with the service at Chick-fil-A and filed a complaint with them.  It was over getting home with my order to go and missing one sandwich. They immediately called me to resolve the issue then sent me coupons for a free sandwich. The crispy chicken sandwich was the best. I am no longer angry with Chick-fil-A. I am not a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Cashiers were nice.  Treated me with courtesy.  Sandwich was hot and so were the fries.  Employees were actually cleaning the tables and floor unlike McDonald's !"}
{"text":"Food was hot, service was great.  The restaurant was clean Well run restaurant!  Jerry Gale was great wishing everyone a merry Christmas.  He seemed very sincere."}
{"text":"Best run fast food place ever.  Always clean, employees are well mannered.  Food is great compared to other fast food restaurants.  What other restaurant do you have people outside taking orders to speed up the drive through during lunch hours.  A+"}
{"text":"We just stopped in today to get a to-go order. One full meal and an order of fries and a shake.
Everything arrived quickly, hot and very fresh. This place is known to be crowded due to popularity and we were still in and out in a small amount of time. The customer service is outstanding and this place is very clean. We have stopped in to numerous locations and this is definitely the number one location. I hope to visit again. I recommend this location to any Chick-Fil-A lover."}
{"text":"Ok, Ok, im a hypocrite. I said on my previous review of In-n-out burger i dont eat fast food which is pretty much true but it seems like the opening of Chick-fil-a is kind of a big deal here in Sin City. If you think about it, this southern based, bible belt, extremly conservative business opening in Sin City seems like, well, committing a sin? Aw heck, its just food. Nothing more, nothing less. The wife wanted to eat here and she pretty much gets what she wants .... pretty much. 

So many people but they handle the hungry masses here with grace under pressure. Not 1 but two drive thru lanes with employees outside directing traffic and taking orders. You can tell everything here is process oriented. Despite the hoard of people, the wait in line was less than 5 minutes and no problem finding a table, and this is the location closest to the strip. Plenty of parking. Plenty of outside shaded tables. Plenty of employees on dining room duty to keep the area clean and tables a turning and can you believe it ... drink refills at your table?  Wow! Plus they deliver to your table. The culture with this company is 100% service oriented and it shows. Crew here is very well trained. The key ingredients here are efficiency, value and tasty food. Who would have thought?

They say \"Eat more chikin\" 
We say.   \"Great food at a great value\"

The best part? We both ate for under $14.00!"}
{"text":"Come on, it's Chick-fil-A, you know it's gonna be great! Convenient location right next to the 202, it's clean, the employees are super friendly (and generous with the chick-fil-a sauce, my personal favorite), and it's delicious. They have a nice play area for the kiddos as well."}
{"text":"They love to use old stale tortillas as well as not fill up all the chicken mini biscuits with chicken and leave you just an empty biscuit. When you call to complain they do nothing to fix the meal that you're trying to enjoy but will tell you they'll send you a coupon for your next meal"}
{"text":"My little man and I love this place. Its friendly and the food is great. I have never encountered a rude soul here. The little play area is cleaner than the McDs so I take little man there to play. We also love all of the events they have going on. Macaroni Kids Robinson and MOPS have fundraisers or free kid activity nights at this location often."}
{"text":"So after my last review the owner contacted me personally (through Yelp) and apologized for my experience and comped a meal for me.  My next experience was very good.  I raised my rating because it's not every day that you encounter a business willing to go the extra mile for their customers.  I was very pleased with the fact that they took time to reach out and correct the experience for me.  Thanks Chik Fil A!  I'll keep coming back.  You model the way for customer service exellence."}
{"text":"For a company like Chick-Fil-A, which sets the gold standard for customer service, this location was a major letdown. The drive-thru layout is very poor, and does not properly designate where to go. 3 out of 4 entrances are blocked off with cones, and the right entrance leads to a confusing maze of cones, with very little indication of where to go. I got there at 10:15 am this morning, and it took about 10 minutes to navigate to the right entrance. I was still in line in time for their breakfast menu at this point. When the girl taking orders finally got to me at 10:34, she told me the cut off for breakfast was 10:30, and that I couldn't order breakfast, even though I was in line before 10:30. She did nothing to fix the problem, other than to give me a half hearted \"sorry\", and implore I order a lunch item, which I was going to get anyway for later today, in addition to my breakfast. When I reached the cashier, I told him I wanted to complain to the manager. He told me the manager would be waiting with my food. The manager wasn't, when I got to the main window. When I complained a third time to the girl there, she quickly shooed me away and said she would pass the complaint on, but the manager was too busy. She also gave a half hearted \"sorry\". NOTHING was done to fix this problem, and frankly, I left with the impression that my complaint would NOT be passed on to the manager. The customer service here did not live up to the standards of other Chick-Fil-A restaurants across the country, who in the past quickly dealt with any problems I had. I WILL NOT be coming back to this location, until their employees and manager rise up to their company's standards."}
{"text":"Lets start with i hate pickles.  Why would you put these abominations on a chicken sandwich.  Im sure i could ask for a sandwich without them, why would i have to.  Who puts pickles on a chicken sandwich?  Ill go to every other restaurant in the world that doesnt add the worst thing you could add to a sandwich ever.  Where could i go???  Oh yeah anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went to this location last week and the lady at the window was so nice. You could tell she actually enjoyed her job and made me feel welcomed. The food was, as always, so delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is NEVER open. It's 7:30 on a Thursday. Why are you closed?! On the rare times it's open it's great. After all this is the ONLY chick in Canada"}
{"text":"I love me some Chick-fil-A. if they can just make sure the order is right that would be great!"}
{"text":"My experience with Chick-Fil-A food has been pretty benign.  And I think that fits their character on the fast food landscape.  Decent, harmless, slightly better than your average burger chain.

I am aware they are owned by a Christian owner and that is why they are closed on Sundays and I respect the decision to take that stand despite any business they may lose on Sunday.

But this morning I stopped into this location - thought I might try their breakfast offerings.  As I stood in line I realized I was hearing some pretty offensive \"Jesus Rock\" over the store audio.  I don't recall the song but I caught lyrics about \"savior of the sinners\" and \"almighty glory\" and \"we must repent\"...there was plenty more.

As I said, I respect your decision to close on Sunday's, it's your business.  And this new treat of proselytizing to music - that's your decision as well.  And just as I can't stand people peddling their religion at my doorstep, I won't stick around for the Chick-Fil-A version of a revival - you've gone too far - I turned around and left and will likely never return to a Chick-Fil-A.  

What's next, a sign on the entrance \"God Fearing Christians Only\" or \"We Reserve The Right To Deny Service To Those Who Do Not Share Our Born Again Belief System\""}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A is one of the fast food chains I will on occasion patronize-A.  You know why?  Because when I have some of their nuggets or strips and a fry I don't feel nauseous and greasy and heavy like I would if I had gone to BK or MCD or most of the other chains.

And I really like the waffle fries.  If only Chick-fil-A had some cheese sauce for the fries.  Yum.

The quality has been consistent.  So, while the food at Chick-fil-A is kind of bland at least it's decent and doesn't make me feel ill."}
{"text":"Despite being known for good and polite service, I did not receive this type of service from this restaurant. First of all, I was looked over twice while being next up in line. How rude was that. When I was eventually waited on, I was received by a kindly and respectful older lady. Through out my time there, i only talked with her since she was the only decent employee there while the others seemed like they were too busy and put on FALSE friendly services."}
{"text":"So I never ate at Chick-fil-a and started hearing about all the hype about this place.  Then driving through town I see people waiting in line with police oversight and just waiting for the day that I would have time to give this a try 

Well that day came.  About a month ago I noticed that the lines subsided and there was no wait at the drive thru.  Like a little kid, my anticipation of tasting something new was beyond belief after people went hysterical over the opening of Chick-fl-a

I ordered the chicken fingers and have to say I was so disappointed.  When I bit into the chicken it tasted like regular chicken and to this day I don't understand why people went ape shit over a piece of chicken. 

It's regular chicken with decent tasting sauces.  And this is what the mass hysteria is about???

I guess now I know why I don't follow the masses."}
{"text":"3.6/5 First time to try chick-fil-a, and it was unlike other fried chicken chain. 

The line was long, but the service was fast (~15 mins in line to pick up for 3 full lines.)

I wanted to try their famous spicy chicken sandwich, but they don't serve it for breakfast, so got a chicken biscuit instead. 

The chicken biscuit was very simple, literally only chicken and biscuit, but its tasty, and freshly made. Dont know if I should expect it to be crispy (mine was not). The chicken is real, neither greasy nor floury. My suggestion is to order it with some sauces (no sauce when ordered entree only) so that your biscuit is not too dry."}
{"text":"Soooooooo Gooooooood!  Thank you and God bless you.  God watches good deeds and you guys deliver quality and respect for brother."}
{"text":"My issue with this location is service. The food was consistent with other locations I have eaten at. We were trying to grab a quick bite for breakfast as running around...well it took 15 mins in the drive through!! So much for fast food. And we would have just left but the drive is setup in a way you can't get out. I have seen many other locations know how to handle a busy morning and they by far do not."}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on for 6 years. Always friendly staff and food is always hot and fresh. Their milkshakes are best in Arizona. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"There are way too many places to get chicken these days. What differentiates Chick-fil-A from the rest is that this place specializes in it. Want a burger? You won't find anything beef related here. This place invented the chicken sandwich, and they do it better than anyone. It's also a place where you will find the service to be higher than any other restaurant. This place sets the bar high in that category. Friendly faces abound, from the cashier to the managers, who generally walk around the store visiting every table and asking if your drink needs refilled or your tray emptied. And it's genuine joy on these people's faces, not a forced smile. Get yourself a chicken sandwich, some waffle fries, and a cup of lemonade and forget about your diet for a while. The lemonade is quite possibly the best I've ever had..anywhere. They also bring your food out to your table if you dine in. If you are looking for a fast, tasty chicken meal, look no further. The service alone will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. 
My poor husband. The Chick-fil-A at San Tan in Gilbert typically fails in some way when he is getting food from there - wrong item, no fries, no answer at the drive thru.... but today takes the cake. 

Today when he opened the steamy foil package, he found a bite taken out of his sandwich!!!! 

This is enough for me to even boycott this location. :( 

I called and spoke with the manager and told her that someone in the back was hungry. She apologized,but there is no excuse."}
{"text":"As a gal from Georgia, I have had my fair share of Chick-fil-A - in fact, its one of my favorite places to go! 
This place is the best Chick-fil-a in Gilbert - very fast and so friendly!  
My usual - class #1 with BBQ sauce, my husband gets the spicy chicken sandwich.  He likes to mix the ranch and buffalo sauce to have his fancy sauce! :) 

Again, this my favorite location - despite being busy, they are fast and always helpful!"}
{"text":"I love Chic-fil-a but I have never got anything here that was served hot, not even enough to melt the cheese on a sandwich and never hit or even warm fries."}
{"text":"I've visited this location 4 times, 3 times were to replace either part or all of a food order. The 4th time I was about to order food but after waiting almost 7 mins without being noticed I walked out. I talked with the store manager and expressed my feelings and concerns. The store manager just wanted to send me on my way with some coupons and an apology. Sometimes, \"sorry\" isn't enough. I work in management doing food service and the service I got at this location was absolutely pathetic. 

There was a shift supervisor working in the drive thru area that never turned around the notice the front counter if anyone was standing there, which I were. There was an employee that was ringing up another employees order,....neither noticed me. I felt like a ghost.. I'll never go back to this place again, ever."}
{"text":"This has to be quite possibly the nicest staff I've ever witnessed at Chick Fila. The restaurant is clean and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Everyone loves Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwiches (and they are pretty damn good) but the service here is friendly and the place is just damn spotless clean.  The men's can even has some kind of dried flower arrangement, is this a fast food joint or a sushi bar?

Don't rely on the stupid google map for directions, this place is actually south of 202 at E. Ray Road.  I never trust that idiotic GPS stuff anyway."}
{"text":"I always find the best customer service and welcoming atmosphere here! Plus the food is great! Chic fil a has been a support to Calvary Chapel Green Valley! Thanks Manager Garrett for your hospitality!"}
{"text":"My first visit for lunch.  A couple of grandchildren wanted to eat here.  I tried a chicken salad and it was tasty.  My two grandchildren had the children's menu.  It was nice That they could personalize their meal.  One had chicken nuggets with fruit and the other chicken nuggets with waffle fries.  They were told that if they did not like the toy that came with their lunch they could trade it in (unopened) for a dish or cone of ice cream. 

This business was busy.  The bathroom was small.  I went in to wash my hands and had to wait for 3 people ahead of me at the one sink and two stall bathroom.  I noticed when I sat down at our booth that there was a hand sanitizing machine on the wall so I could have skipped the bathroom.  

The drive up was busy too with two lanes and it appears that you give your order directly to a person standing in the drive thru lane.  I am not sure if that is standard procedure for this business or if the drive thru microphones were not working.

There was personal service  too as someone stopped by and asked if we needed any drink refills or condiments.  

Personally for me I don't make a habit of eating at fast food restaurants but I wouldn't mind trying a few other menu items down the road."}
{"text":"Continual problem for Chick-Fil-A: not providing \"supply\" for the demand. Really.  Figure it out.  In the top three laws of economics:  never let demand go unsupplied.  Ever.  Great company.  Great food.  HORRIFIC LOGISTICS.  You know there will be retaliatory loss of business across the brand from all of those walking away, late for flights, etc.  Including me."}
{"text":"Did not have a great experience here! Extremely slow drive thru, when we finally got to the window they made us park next door in a fire lane blocking incoming traffic to wait another 20 minutes to get our food! I've been going to chic-fil-a for years and never experienced service like we had today! I will NEVER come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am an avid fan of Chick-Fil-A! Being from the South, it is my go to fast casual place. I'm practically an unpaid brand ambassador as much as I talk about it. My boyfriend and I even want to cater Chick-Fil-A at our wedding because it identifies us so much. I always brag to everyone that the customer service is incredible and about how your order isn't ever wrong...until this location. WHAT IS GOING ON? I'm going to have to start checking my order before I leave like I'm at McDonalds. (Insert roll eye emoji) 

Tonight, I ordered a 6 count nugget kids meal with Chick-Fil-A and Polynesian sauce with a medium Arnold Palmer to drink and a large number 1 with a lemonade to drink. I got Sprite instead of Arnold Palmer, no Polynesian sauce, and my fries are burnt?   The receipt is correct, so I'm not sure where the issue happens, but this happens almost every other time at this location...and it literally BREAKS MY HEART.  

I would prefer waiting longer in line to ensure I get the correct order than feel rushed to check that everything is correct in the drive thru (no one wants to be that person) or get home to incorrect items. (Insert pissed off emoji)

Please get it together, so I can continue to share my love for this brand with everyone. I'm tired of hearing, \"it must only be good in the South\". 

Disappointed Chick-Finatic,

Update: The past few visits have been much better, and the follow up from the team at Chick-Fil-A shows how much they care about their guests!"}
{"text":"I give this fast food joint 5 stars for many reasons. I have never had a negative experience here and let me tell you I've been here a lot! A big reason is the service for sure! I brought my dog one time through the drive thru and the employees were so nice to him and he even got a little treat to go. The people that work here really show they love their job and treat everyone with respect. 

Now for the food, well the nuggets are my FAVORITE! The waffle fries are delicious and cooked healthier than most are. I always get their lemonade to drink because its homemade. If I have room for more I have to get their Milkshake. It is by far my favorite out there! Chick-Fil-A you never let me down!"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food joint, by far. Fries are always fresh & the chicken is always hot. The only \"complaint\" I have is when I'm craving them on Sundays, they're not open! Haha!"}
{"text":"The service and food is always excellent but the inside of the restaurant could qualify for the fixer upper show. Some of the booth seating is so worn down that the leather is ripped off and the yellow padding is showing. The floors in the back seemed to have a water spill or maybe a leak because there was a puddle of water. I wish they would upgrade and have a few tables that were family style seating similar to the one in Gastonia, NC but maybe that is asking for too much."}
{"text":"Generally speaking most chick-fil-a locations are about the same. This one does a great job and the man who runs this one is so nice! Very friendly staff and usually quick service."}
{"text":"The staff here are on their A-game! They greeted me and took my order with professionalism. Then Ernette cleaned an entire table for me and my son, grabbed a high chair, and set a table cover down. And my sandwich was made perfectly too. Just thought I'd give credit where it's due, because not every CFA has made me feel this welcomed."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying Chick-fil-A is a fast food restaurant, so don't come here expecting something more than that. That being said, Chick-fil-A does a decent job at providing a consistent product, which I appreciate from a fast food chain. 

The food is pretty good for a fast food option, and I would choose it over most other fast food joints any day. The spicy chicken sandwich is pretty well seasoned and actually has a bit of a kick. The most impressive thing here, though, is the quality of service. 

We stopped here the weekend it opened, after making a quick trip to the mall and finding ourselves hungry and not in the mood for anything longer than a drive through trip. I expected there to be a long line, so when we rolled up to the drive through to a fast moving, relatively short line, I was very surprised. The Chick-fil-A staff was extremely prepared to handle the crowds they anticipated on opening weekend, as there were people handling multiple lines of cars at several points in the drive through. Someone handed us menus as we entered, another person took our orders a bit further down, and yet another person collected our payment and gave us sauce and napkins. We arrived at the window very quickly, where we were handed our food, and that was it! Every single person we interacted with was very polite and addressed us by name, which we were very impressed with. 

I'm interested to see if Chick-fil-A maintains this quality of service at this location, because that alone is reason enough for me to choose Chick-fil-A over other fast food options."}
{"text":"The orginal chick sandwhich is my favorite , but all their food is always perfect. Also just tried their frozen lemonade and it was delicious! Love their food but not their politics"}
{"text":"Brought our football team, everyone was super friendly, and super fast for our group. Wouldn't hesitate to bring a group back again."}
{"text":"Well this was my time to ever have a chick-fil-a and it was great !! The food was so good and the service was the best!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once for lunch and once for breakfast. Place was busy for lunch but had a lot of cashiers and food came out quick. Food was fresh and delicious. Happy to have chick fil a in vegas"}
{"text":"This just opened down the street from my house. I stopped by the drive thru because I was craving a vanilla milkshake. When I ordered, the very polite young man on the intercom informed me their milkshake machine was broken. I didn't want anything else so I drove forward. I was stuck in the lane because a minivan was in front of me and ordered for the whole soccer team apparently. I was just going to drive off once the van left but the young man at the window waved me down and gave me a free chocolate chip cookie. And it was warm! That was such a nice gesture and something that creates customer loyalty. It was a small gesture but it made a huge impression because they obviously have excellent training in customer service. I will definitely be back just because of that experience."}
{"text":"Not a big fast food fan, but I feel good bring my kids here when in a fox for time to get them lunch. 

Customer service with the staff has been the key with Chic fil a over the years and that's pretty consistent across all stores. 

Placing your order is o e part of the process in not a big fan of as they are fixing your beverages for you while trying to get your order. If your ordering for 4+ people then they are handing you those drinks as you pay and then your trying to figure out how to handle the drinks, sauces (which your requesting) and the container all at once. 

Refills of lemonade are what keep me locked in and I'm sure I'm like a few others who have grabbed a few extra ketchup packets for a random packed lunch :-p

If you didn't know, if you get a kids meal you can trade in the book or toy for ice cream cone. They only have vanilla but gives the kid an option at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"We are always greeted right away and the staff is always friendly. Food is great and the staff comes around and checks to see if you need anything."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Chik fil a has been advertised nationally as having a deal for teacher appreciation day today. My son and I went to this location after school today, and I was informed that this location had chosen not to run that promotion. We do not get take out often, and my son was very excited, so I went ahead and purchased since we were already there, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A (as a corporation) but this location is sub-par when you compare it to other ones in the area and even as a whole. 

You always feel rushed when ordering in the drive-the and they don't repeat your order back for clarification. Not to mention the line is always long and/or takes forever."}
{"text":"Always love Chick-fil-A and this is no exception. Their managers Claudia and Justin are great! The minis are my favorite breakfast item and you seriously can't go wrong with the regular sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"We stop here a few days out of the month for a morning chicken sandwich. Well this morning, we ordered a large lemonade and we got a large cup of ice with a few on ounces of lemonade. Kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the worst drive-thru. They ALWAYS forget sometime and I ALWAYS have to go inside. And the kids that work there don't act like they care. Too bad it's the only one in my area."}
{"text":"Fast food can be delicious, at least at Chik-Fil-A!

I met some moms here for a little play date and lunch, I hate McD's and this is another option - a better, cleaner, more nutritious and delicious option.

UPS:
My daughter hates nuggets, any nuggets, anywhere.  She LOVED these nuggets and the fruit cup, she finished it all!  

The play area is smaller but it's nicer and cleaner and has less kids running around (at least on this afternoon).

They have delicious and fresh salad options which also come with their scrumptious chicken (you can get grilled too).  Love the dressings!

Friendly and helpful staff.

DOWNS:
A little pricey for those fresh salad options (almost $8)

Sucky kids toys (comic book?)"}
{"text":"The breakfast food at this location is not very good.  Everytime I've ordered chicken minis from this restaurant, the bread has been hard.  I've had to remove the top piece of bread and eat the chicken as if it were pate.   Even when I tried to switch it up and order the chicken biscuit meal, the biscuit was doughy and the hash browns were undercooked.  I now drive pass this location to go to another Chicken fil a elsewhere to get my morning meal."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A in general but I feel like every Chick-fil-A in the south is always swamped. Even though it was extremely busy I felt like this Chick-fil-A did a great job of moving people through the restaurant and did their best to make sure everyone got what they ordered"}
{"text":"Food:
The chicken is so tender &a perfectly seasoned. The lemonade taste homemade. Brownies & cookies are a little pricey but still amazing

The staff:
The staff Has always been so friendly & patient. Every time I come they are nice &a very efficient without making you feel rushed. I love how they operate the drive thru. It makes it so much quicker. I can't imagine how slow it would be if they didn't have the employees outside taking your order

Location:
I've been to both of the locations and they are equally amazing. I don't really have a preference. This location is near my house & the other one is near my church."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A. The only people that don't haven't been there. This restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly (as usual). My kids meal was exactly to my liking...but no surprise there.

Overall, this is the only fast food establishment I choose to go to."}
{"text":"One of the best fastfood options around

This Chick-fil-A has friendly staff and are quick with their service.  Food is good and sit better than the other fastfood places around.  

I really like their chicken soup when I'm battling a cold-- the warmth, perfect mix of noodle and chicken, and saltiness hit the spot."}
{"text":"One of the best additions to East Washington since I've lived on the east side (that's only about 8 months for those of you who are wondering). I have no complaints about this Chick-Fil-A! It's one of the few fast food establishments that does not have the garbage overflowing. Like everyone else, I wish they were open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome!!! And they actually listen when you ask for extra condiments! They are super fast and the dinning area is flawless! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Once again, they have really good service here. While we were eating our Classic Chicken sandwiches a staff member walked by to see if we wanted any sauce or other extras. I've never encountered service like that at any restaurant before. The prices are a little higher than some other fast food chains but that's ok because the food is really good and fresh. Don't forget, you can exchange the bible verses in the kid's meal for an ice cream cone! It's a busy destination in the food court but it's well worth trying, especially if you haven't had anything like it before."}
{"text":"Always fast, pleasant, efficient, and fresh.  This place does it right!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Chick-fil-A the service from employees no matter where you go is impeccable! The food is also THE BEST that you can get.... I wish I could put a 1 star because of them not opening on sundays when I crave it the most ironically; but I can't 5 star fast food for sure!"}
{"text":"I come here often so I figure it's time for me to write my review. 
Being from the south, I missed my Chickfila! Was so stoked when they came to Calgary. Yes, it's in the airport but it's worth the visit. They did away with the free 30 parking so on this trip I brought hubby and dropped him to get the goods while I waited in the cell lot. 

Their nuggets are da bomb! REAL breast meat chicken-no preformed shapes here. The waffle fries are always yummy hot or cold and it all goes wonderfully with their Chickfila sauce. Plus they have REAL sweet ice tea like from home! That is worth the trip alone!

Staff has always been friendly and the restaurant clean. Wait for food can be take a few minutes but that's because they usually cook to order, which is fine by me. 

So happy to have a piece of home here in Calgary!"}
{"text":"We have adopted this as our Chick Fil A because its the closest one. My son loves chicken nuggets. We are here at least once a week. 

Service is always great, friendly, and quick. But this review is specifically about my visit earlier today. 

I went inside because I needed to order some party trays for this afternoon. I believe she's a manager, and I already forgot how to spell her name but it starts with a T, was FABULOUS. She greeted me right away, asked how she could help, and then offered me a seat so we could sit down and discuss my order.

Another guy asked me if he could get me a drink, so I ordered a cherry coke with full intentions to pay for it. He said it was on the house. Sweet!

While discussing my order, the manager asked if I wanted to do some cookies to, I hesitated because I had not tried them and before I could answer, she ran back into the kitchen to grab me one. A warm, chocolate chip cookie. It was delicious! Then another employee brought me a milk, just as a nice gesture. He told me it was the best way to enjoy their cookies. 

Its been a long time since I have had such good service. I know they've gotten a bad rap in recent years for the owners religious views, but great customer service will keep us coming back. This is how customers want to be treated, and we definitely take note and remember!

Not only was I in and out in less than 10 minutes for a large order, they offered to cut the cookies a certain way so it would be easier to serve the kiddos at the school party this afternoon. I so appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into taking care of me today!"}
{"text":"Every single time I've come to this location, they forget my salad dressing. How hard is your job? Really? This is the closet location to my parents house, where I take my son swimming often during the week. It's 20 minutes away. We got all the way home and once again, no dressing. Must be my fault for continuing to come to this location and expecting someone to do their job correctly."}
{"text":"There is always a huge line for lunch, backed up onto the street.  The employees work fast, but it can still take quite awhile to get through, so if your in a hurry...you may want to skip this place.

The food is good and I have never had any problems with my order"}
{"text":"Dude it's A Chicfila.  I've never met one I didn't like. The people are so nice and the customer service is awesome sauce!! Sometimes when it's nice outside and there's a huge line in the drive thru they come out and take your order to get you in and out. If I could live here I would. The only con I can think of is the fact that these guys are closed on Sundays but I respect that and enjoy my Chicfila Chicken nugget obsession six days a week. Their lemonade also compliments the whole meal. The location is perfect to my house and it's right near the waterfront. I end up here every time I'm at the Target down the street."}
{"text":"For a fast food place, this is #1. The food is great...best chicken sandwich of any.  And I love that they close on Sunday so people have the chance to go to church.  The young staff hustles, they respond to my 'thank you saying 'my pleasure' in stead of 'no problem ' (which is a pet peeve of mine).  It's a good thing they aren't close to me or I'd eat more than my share."}
{"text":"The staff here were the friendliest staff I have ever seen in a restaurant!  The place is VERY clean, and your order is always correct, and extremely fresh.  Their drink selections were very broad, which my family and I appreciated.  I highly recommend this place for anyone!"}
{"text":"Great food excellent service.  Young guy josh helped us out.  He was super friendly and took my tray when i was done....great service.  Cant get enough of the food."}
{"text":"The employees here work extremely hard and fast! I've been twice and never had any issues,  even how busy they are! You guys know the definition of teamwork! I love love your food and will be a long time customer!"}
{"text":"I love the spicy chicken sandwich, also the iced tea/lemonade mixture I usually get instead of soda. The waffle fries are usually awesome when they are fresh out of the fryer... unfortunately the batch I got yesterday were cold and tasted like an ashtray. The dog enjoyed them, though."}
{"text":"This location recently opened. We have been twice and our service has been efficient, consistent, and outstanding. The restaurant and bathrooms are very clean. Love the location as well, right by car dealerships and shopping!"}
{"text":"Love to come here for the fries and shakes! Delicious and quick, friendly service."}
{"text":"Have been eating here since I was a small child. I have always loved this place and I always will. They're consistent, food is always hot, staff is always friendly, restaurants are always clean, and they literally offer everything you can imagine as far as condiments and things like that."}
{"text":"I just drove 15 mins for the some super regular chicken its all bull, hype go to jack in the box spicy chicken same shit! Oh and they got my order wrong they forgot the only burger I was super excited to try... they are super skimp with the sauces that's the only thing that's good is the sauces...I did call and they told me I have a free burger but honestly if hadn't already paid for it I wouldn't got back for it...don't think I'll ever come back"}
{"text":"Got a pick up order friday... 2 kids meals with the ice cream cup instead the toy... why oh why, would someone of even moderate intelligence put frozen ice cream in with hot food? Ever have refrozen melted ice cream? It's not pleasant AND the kids got cold chicken tenders. Yeah guys... not a winning night. Next time please put the ice cream either in a to go cup holder or it's own separate bag... for the love of Frosty."}
{"text":"Yes! Such a great Chick-Fil-A.  
For some reason my wife and I started a list of the 5 best places in Charlotte for customer service and this Chick-fil-A in particular is probably #1 on our kind of cheesy but totally cool list.  Whether I go through the drive-thru or into the restaurant, I am always greeted with a smile and by a friendly face.  I look forward to eating here not only for the fresh and delicious food but for the helpful and happy atmosphere.  And while I may not agree with some of Chick-fil-a's policies (you know what I'm talking about), how can I expect people to respect my opinions if I don't respect theirs?  So let's focus on the great food and service and the things we have in common instead of those we do not!  Do yourself a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"The food was good, really overpriced.  The service was great. Everything was really clean for a fast food place.  It seems like every time I get to have Chic fil a that their food shrinks."}
{"text":"From the chicken to the staff, everything was a 10 plus.
This is fast food but done better than the rest."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how much I love their chicken sandwich & the waffle fries.  Oh btw u HAVE TO TRY their chick fil a sauce. Its liquid gold"}
{"text":"I went into this location expecting that it would be like all of the other Chic-fil-A's I'd been through. Boy, was I wrong. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Club sandwich meal which comes with waffle fries and a soft drink or tea. I ordered the diet lemonade as my drink. The order comes and it's in a paper bag. I tell the person who brought the meal that the food was to eat there, not to go. I'm told that this location, unlike all of the others, serves everything to go (not served on a tray). So I'm supposed to eat off of the table with no tray? I turns out that there are plastic place mats but you have to ask for them. They are kept out of view. Why can't the employees just give you one to begin with? Back to the food. What I got was an ice cold sandwich and soggy fries. After much prodding the sandwich was replaced. I wanted ketchup. Guess what? They hide in a drawer out of the customer's sight. Why? I finish my meal and am about to leave when I happen to look at my receipt. I find out that I have been charged extra for the diet lemonade. I go to the counter and ask to speak to someone about this. Over comes Jim who is supposed to be the manager. I point out that the menu sign says that a drink is included with the meal. He tells me that lemonade is not considered a soft drink. Once again, WHAT? So, I say \"Why doesn't the menu board say that there is an extra charge for lemonade or why doesn't the person taking the orders let you know that?\" His reply is: \"You should have known that it was extra\". When did I become a mind reader? Somebody needs to tell the guests that there is an extra charge for certain beverages OR make sure that it is clearly written on the menu sign. This was my first visit to this location and my last visit too. Chick-fil-A corporate office, you need to have a look at this location. It does not meet the standards that the guests expect."}
{"text":"I'm confident in saying that I'm THE happiest person that a Chick-fil-A opened within 2 miles of where I live. Being from the east coast, I've always missed this place since moving to Vegas! Though the excitement for all the first timers and newbies creates a bit of a constant rush, it's awesome seeing that. It's also amazing how well the staff handles the high volume and how unbelievably pleasant and smiley they are! My favorite Chick-fil-A I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Just went through the chick fill-a drive through. Ordered a chick fill-a sandwich meal. Pulled up to pay and handed the clerk my free chick fill-a sandwich meal card. She handed me my order and closed the window. No thank yous no have a nice day, no would you like ketchup or any kind of sauce.so I pulled away thinking maybe she put sauce in the bag. But to my not suprised. Look there was no sauce or ketchup there was not even a recite  in the bag. And since u was already running late for my dr. And was hungry I ate the dry as the desert chick fill-a sandwhich and fries and drank the flat watered down diet coke. So chick fill-a on mayo Blvd just west of Scottsdale rd. I want to thank you for one of the worst customer service days I have had in a long time. And I will go to the subway over by you the next time I'm in the area and are hungry."}
{"text":"First time having Chick-Fil-A and must say it was the best chicken sandwich I have ever had.  The restaurant was surprisingly clean and service fast, especially with the lines and amount of people!  Staff continually cleaning and attending to guests.  Very impressive for a fast food place."}
{"text":"It's typical.... it's a new location. It's really easy to get to from work for lunch. ..I really liked the service and the food was good tasting. If you have ever eaten at any other location you know what to expect. ..I have to visit in a few weeks when is no longer new. ...Look for an update eventually."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE!  The drive thru was literally wrapped around the building so I ran inside to take to go. The line was quick moving and the service provided by every employee was AMAZING. Food order was correct and fresh.  Definitely would return to this location if we visit the area again."}
{"text":"Tried the chick fil a here in vegas first time to have one the drive through line is crazy but it's actually moving fast and we got our food quick and my husband bought all the police officer some lunch just because  for my first time tasting there food and I must say it is pretty good my daughter love there chicken nuggets the fries is yummy love there ice tea it's better than canes"}
{"text":"CHIKN IZ GUUD. Seriously the chicken rocks. I personally love the chicken strips. Waffle fries also are the best. Oh and don't get me started on the cookies and cream milkshake. I kill for those things. 

This location was pretty average. The service was a little slow but not bad. 

If you are going to eat fast food this is the place to go"}
{"text":"I have a shameless love for Chick-fil-A soley based on the fact that their chicken is amazing. I hate fast food but I legit love this place. And don't get me started on the oreo milkshakes...."}
{"text":"The staff is somewhat friendly, but it seems that there is no dominant person at the front counter that can deal with the disorderly trash that seem to scuttle in here. I observed many customer/employee verbal altercations while sitting in the restaurant. Each of these altercations was due to a customer that needed to be refused service. Poor management was very obvious and they expected these young cashiers to manage these unruly, rude, and heavily intoxicated customers.

This location is extremely dirty and so were to restrooms. Plenty of employees, but again, it seemed that no one was really running the place.

Post a sign: We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone! This is not discrimination if implemented properly, this is proper business ethics in keeping a clean and quiet business for the remaining patrons who are quietly trying to enjoy their meal. Rude, disrespectful, disorderly, and intoxicated individuals need not be served."}
{"text":"This is a very busy and still great location! Excellent service and very friendly. Restrooms are clean and there seems to be enough staff to manage the constant flow of customers. My food was great on each visit!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The frozen lemonade is amazing! I love the fact that the founder upholds Christian values and has all of the chains closed on Sundays in reverence for the Lord."}
{"text":"You will never be disappointed in the customer service here everyone is so fricken nice!!! It makes me smile walking into chick-for-a because they are always so nice and very quick. There Chick-fil-a sauce is addicting! Food is great and if you were to ever have a problem (most likely never) they'd be more than happy to fix it !"}
{"text":"How is it that no matter what time of day it is, this place is busy with cars wrapped around the building? It's always quicker to go inside than staying in the drive through. The food is great for fast food. Service is outstanding. I have picked up large orders from here and the orders were NEVER ready on time and rarely correct. They would be missing utensils or beverages or something. Also note that CFA does not includes plates or cups with its catering orders. Strange considering CFA is usually practically perfect in every way. So be sure to order all of the extras and to check your bags when you pick them up."}
{"text":"It was my pleasure to go through the drive through. Ordered an Oreo shake. To really appreciate the whip cream, take the lid off and eat it immediately or else it'll melt into the shake. 

Of course the cashier was nice. Always a great experience at Chic-Fil-A."}
{"text":"Had my first Chick fil a experience here. Amazing!! Staff was super friendly and food was greater than expected! I ordered the spicy chicken deluxe meal with a the chick fil a sauce. Yummers... The sauce along with the waffle fries are phenomenal. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Food is always good here, but the service is HORRIBLE. Rudest staff I've ever come face to face with. On top of all of that they are SUPER stingy about sauces, they act like they come out of their paycheck. Wish this wasn't the closest one to me..."}
{"text":"If you haven't had their chicken mini's your missing out...they are biscuit s soft with a hint of honey flavor with their delicious chicken nuggets inside...they are served for breakfast only which kind of sucks because I could eat these all day...the breakfast burrito is yummy too.love it! Great service!"}
{"text":"Shockingly horrible service for any place, but especially Chick Fil A. The kid taking our order in the drive thru was incompetent and rude. I would tell him what we wanted, he'd repeat it back with about 50% accuracy, and ask if that was it after each thing as I'm ordering for four people, trying to help him get it right, which he was struggling to do. Simple things, people. We pull up to the window and the girl tells us we ordered diet drinks and I said we didn't order any diet drinks. Snaps at me and says that's what they ALWAYS call the drink we ordered. Um, ok, never heard that before and this is the only drink I ever order. We drive away, rushing to the movie theater and realize that our two drinks (same drinks as part of the same sized meals) were not only different sizes, but tasted completely different (half iced tea, half lemonade). Our two different sandwiches were in the wrong boxes and they complete forgot an extra large fry we had ordered. 

I've never had such a poor experience at a Chick Fil A. With the other comments from people saying they've been shorted on food, I'm inclined to think these \"mistakes\" are an attempt to steal. Corporate needs to step in."}
{"text":"As a wanna-be vegan, I feel guilty for loving this Chick-Fil-A, but they definitely earned it. I stopped by last week around 1 or 1:30pm to pick up a sandwich and milkshake (umm peppermint chocolate chip? HECK YES!). 

From placing my order to receiving the items, every single employee was cheerful, friendly, exceedingly polite, and just generally awesome. I didn't realize how good service could be. These are the nicest people. I left in such a good mood. 

And the food! Maybe it's just cuz I rarely eat fast food, but everything was frickin delicious. 

Speedy, efficient, just overall fabulous. There's even a play area, so bring the kiddos!"}
{"text":"Food is great it's the long wait in the drive thru that's ridiculous as I'm sitting here waiting on the car in front of me for the last 4 minuets as it looks he's reading the menu over and over and workers are looking back at the and still trying to get this person to order!! Just takes way to long.. ugh
On the upside they are very efficient very friendly and praying that they build one in the Northwest.
Thanks for coming to Vegas Chick-fil-A and this was my daughters request after she gave birth, was her Chick-fil-A!!! So, Centennial Hospital to Rancho Chick-fil-A I went and that's why we need one in the North West, please and thank you."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! Food is hot and delicious. Our favorite is the reg chicken sandwich with extra pickles and Texas Pete sauce! For dessert we like the strawberry milk shakes!!"}
{"text":"We are chick fil A fans big time!! We especially like this one and mill ave Tempe! They have several family/ kid activities that are awesome. The food is always good and the service is the best!!"}
{"text":"Was here on a Thursday at around 1:30 pm with no line. Very odd. Two people outside taking orders and ask if paying cash or credit. Drive around the turn and and some one standing at podium taking my cash than drive to pickup window. What a pain. Maybe to help when things are busy. I got chicken fingers and fries and the chicken was greasy. Ended up with an upset stomach.  Fries were good.  I don't get the hype about this place."}
{"text":"We are a huge Chick-fil-A loyalists -- with an average of weekly visits in California. When we went to Las Vegas for Labor Day weekend, we decided to stop by your location on Sahara and the I-15 for food before driving home to LA. We were met with two lane of confusion, stressed out employees, cars in drive thru lane trying to back up and a very rude manager named Amanda when we asked what is going on and why our food takes 15 min to be served and all she can offer was a \"cone of ice cream\" for the inconvenience. This is NEVER the type of service we get in California as we are used to the \"my pleasure\" greetings. 

I think that the manager Amanda should be reprimanded for the attitude that she presented as she is a representative of the company and the team retrained -- how to handle busy days. 

I did not appreciate being treated like it was OUR FAULT that we messed up our order or waited 15-20 min for our food."}
{"text":"Never understood the attraction of CFilA.  Food is mediocre, not really healthy (read the info on it).  Was dragged in and had the spicy chicken wrap and the spicy sauce was not very good.  

The service was fast, place was clean, can ask for a free refill on your drink are positives.

Was looking into the food info and found out the CFilA is suing a little place for using \"Eat MOR' Kale\" as a by line.  Come on CFilA stop being a Bully!"}
{"text":"One of the friendliest fast food restaurants around is here to hopefully stay in the airport. No matter where you go, these people come from the happy factory. Thank goodness for the food, because the service is poor. They handed us our order without actually fulfilling it, I had to ask them for two separate items they failed to include.

Simplistic food, yet delectable. Try the chicken nuggets and one of the world's best lemonades."}
{"text":"The new app is convenient, which includes Apple Pay and easier customization! The staff are kind and personable, despite how busy this location can be at peak times. The play area is great for children, as well as the inside of the store being clean. The food is served hot and quickly. Drinks are always refilled when inside and employees are conversational toward customers, so you feel like you're in a restaurant instead of fast food! I visit here about three times a month, but I would go every day if I could!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chick-fil-A in Mesa. The staff is great as well. Super friendly and helpful. They make it fun for my children. We love going when Logan is working because she is the best! The restaurant is always very clean and well stocked and did I mention the staff?? A plus!!"}
{"text":"This is a chick-fil-a express, so it's not a full store. But the customer service is still wonderful and lemonade is still banging."}
{"text":"I love their regular chicken sandwich.  I used to eat here once per week, but have become an infrequent customer at once every 3 months or so.  The reason?  About 2 years ago they dumbed down the menu.  They used to have an awesome side salad.  But they changed their salad and the new salad choices aren't as good and don't offer as much veggies in the salad.  So, that's why I give it 3-stars instead of 5-stars."}
{"text":"Chik-fil-A is always good and the employees are so friendly unlike most fast food places. My kid was upset about not getting a better score on a quiz this afternoon and chill-fil-a spicy chicken sandwich makes him smile ..."}
{"text":"Just like most chick-fil-a's this one is great. We came with a chick-fil-a calendar card and they were out of the item which was slightly annoying. However their service and food is always good."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Chick-fil-a and this location was a good  one. Had the grilled chicken sandwich and fries. Only thing that disappointed me was that they no longer have the kids placemats."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than this place, except if they were open on Sunday's which is when I always want it. Grilled nuggets are good and so is grilled chicken sandwich, but old version was better. Buy a calendar card they are a good deal with lots of freebies:"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a goes above and beyond in service. For nurses week they provided us lunch for the day, generously throwing in chicken bites, wraps, cookies, fruit, lemonade and even napkins, utensils and hand sanitizer. We cannot thank them enough for all their kindness and generosity."}
{"text":"I eat here because I really hate chickens and want them all dead and enjoy devouring their cooked carcasses. Beef is for peasants. Chicken is the fish of the farm as they say."}
{"text":"They screwed up my to-go order on 05/09/16 I called the store when I got home said they would replace the meal wrote my name and phone number down and said next time I come in they will take care of it. I walk in the following Saturday and they had no record of the incident. They embarrassed me and made it look like I was trying to get over on a free meal?? Gave me a hard time for no reason it's not my fault you messed up the order then promised to replace it. I love chic Fila but I will NEVER go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A never disappoints. You know what your getting. This one, however, has super friendly staff. I've never had a bad experience at this location."}
{"text":"Normally my wife and I go there and have great experiences and great food, and we get it almost every week, but we had it two days ago and somehow both got food poisoning. Please, make sure employees wash hands and keep from contaminating the food, that's all I ask. Being sick from eating Chick-Fil-A because someone passed over the seemingly small decision to take care of food is totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"I should begin by stating, I love Chick-Fil-A.  I love the food, I love the soup, I love the family owned concept.  However...

I have never seen such poor customer service.  On duty was  a manager and a team leader.  There were, when we arrived, six people in the front and I could see four in the back.  By the time we had our order taken, we counted eight people up front.   Yet, no one was taking orders.  There were four chit-chatting to the side, a manager counting money...they were doing everything but assisting customers.  We waited as next in line for more than ten minutes, and my husband finally asked \"Can you please wait on us?\"

I don't expect perfect, but really, with that many,  people up front, someone should be able to ask if we want fries with that."}
{"text":"My wife went to restroom while I ordered a breakfast.
I said give me chicken sandwiches with cheese and a sausage and egg on Muffin no cheese.
 I paid for the food.
When order came my wife had returned. She says oh no I don't want cheese on my sandwich. Someone behind the counter said, I will see we if we have anymore biscuits. It was 10:30 AM lunch time, we were not aware. Order comes and Cheese on all of them. I send it back.
So my wife orders lunch. I paid again for that. No reply from manager.
My food comes there is still a chicken sandwich with cheese and the sausage egg & Muffin I ordered had no egg just sausage.
 I send it back. At this point. I said just give me a refund, the little manager did so. No trying to make it right for the inconvenience. My wife went back later said we were  not satisfied with service. Maneger:
I'm sorry. 
My  wife said, sorry doesn't cut it, just letting you know so you can learn. 
End of story.
#EATATHOME BAD SERVICE.

The cook can't read.
 Hailey was great she put in right order. The cook kept screwing up. Learn to read the screen cook."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Chick-fil-a. I became obsessed after frequenting it in Southern California. When I found out they were opening one at the Calgary Airport I was ecstatic! 

These reviews about the food not tasting the same and the service being poor are bogus! The food tastes GREAT and the service is decent. The service does have a long way to go when compared to their stateside locations but hopefully they get there. Also, as mentioned before the menu is pared down as well (really miss those milkshakes! Mmmm).

All that said, take it from a number one fan this Chick-fil-a delivers enough for you to become addicted!

Lost a point for not having the full menu and for having a bigot for a CEO!"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A food is always delicious, but this location offers exceptional service! We were greeted warmly and the cashier was extremely patient with our indecisiveness. They helped seat us at a table with a high chair for my one year old, offered him a plastic table mat to eat off of, and someone came around offering refills! They also anticipated our needs and brought us a hand sanitizing wipe for our messy boy! l got better service here than I do at most order-at-the-table restaurants!"}
{"text":"This place really has their fried chicken done right. It's moist, flavorful, tender, and wonderful. Their top management have been viewed as racists but that doesn't take anything away from their ability to fry up some good chicken. 

I had the traditional fried chicken sandwich with fries and my boyfriend had the chicken nuggets with the kale salad (in case you feel like going the healthy route). They give u an option of a number of different sauces. My favorite of which is the Bbq sauce. Their signature sauce is also very good. It reminds me of a mellow thousand island. The restaurant was jam-packed with people and it was tough to find a seat but we really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"best fast food chicken sandwich ever. too bad they are closed sundays."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight and I honestly expected the rush to be over by now. However, the parking lot was just as equally busy with a police officer controlling traffic in the shopping center. As we parked we stood in line outside of the store because the line was that long. A lady came to pass out menus for us to look over and another lady coming up behind her was taking orders through a pad. So we placed our order and by the time we paid for our food they had it ready. We stood in line for 10 minutes upon our order being taken so it was a pretty quick service so don't be intimidated about the long line.

I got the #1 and was excited to try it being my first time. The chicken sandwich with the Polynesian sauce was super good!!! As I grabbed my waffle fry and bit into it I expected a crunchy/ soft texture but it was very soggy and overly oily... it went from a 100 back down to a 0. Gross fries aside... I loved the chicken sandwich and appreciated that since their drinks were behind their counter they had people walking around refilling drinks for us."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times & I can say that I've never had a bad experience at this location. Very clean and staff is pleasant. I usually get the number 4 the Spicy Chicken Deluxe. Yummy! I'm a huge critic when it comes to customer service and food quality and I must say that both are great here."}
{"text":"The food and the staff were outstanding.The establishment was very clean.However they have taken away the mustards and salsa and you now must ask for them,I dont need to bother the staff for a ranch dressing packet (nor do i want to get up from my meal to ask for something) I previously grabbed on my own..Please bring the condiments back out to the public"}
{"text":"Love Chick Fil-A but this place needs some better training or hiring standards.  The \"my pleasures\" and \"have a great days\" just aren't genuine and workers seem unhappy to be there.  Maybe it's a Vegas thing especially on  that side of town but I don't get that vibe from Henderson Chick Fil-A.  Not cool cause this is the one most tourists probably go to.  Let's face it; tourists keep Vegas alive and vibrant so let's show them Vegas ROCKS. 

Speaking of which, across the street isn't very safe so just make sure to grab your goodies and go!  There's a Siegel/Budget Suites there.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"One of two locations to open the same day, the much loved chicken sandwich is here. 

I did not grow up with Chick-fil-A so this was my first time. The opening was hectic with cops directing drive thru traffic and a line outside the store for walk ins. The walk in line moved much quicker than the drive thru. 15-20 minutes and I was seated and had my food. 

Their signature chicken and spicy chicken sandwiches are good. Good portion of white meat chicken that was juicy. Don't bother with the chicken salad. Portion was skimpy and ended up throwing out edges of bread was out of filling. Superfood side salad while tasty was a small portion that cost an additional $1.50. Stick with waffle fries or chicken soup as a side.

I have tried them now and while tasty they are a bit of a drive for me and I wouldn't go out of my way to come. That said their opening went smoothly and I feel bad that their other location was getting bad reviews for not having a full menu. It is the first day. I have eaten at restaurants at a much higher price point that don't have full menus the first day. Streamlining helps new employees still learning the ropes and get food out the door more quickly."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE chick fil a! Every Chick fil a I have the same good experience. I'm writing a review on this location becaues it is the one I tend to go to the most. The chicken sandwich is amazing and the waffle fries are to die for!! I could drink the chickfila sauce it is that good!! I always leave feelings full and can't wait till I come back. Great food, clean enviroment, and friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"As a Southeast native of the US who has eaten Chick-fil-A all my life...I WAS FREAKIN EXCITED! I would only get a chance to have it when I flew home. The service is still A plus and I love that Vegas is keeping with the closed on Sunday but....the food was disappointing. The seasoning was off for me. If they open one closer to the Soutwest side of the city I may give it another try, but for now its not worth the drive."}
{"text":"First time at a chil fil a as I'm moving out here from ct and it didn't disappoint. On top of the quality being far superior to other fast food joints as well as being super good the place itself is very clean and nice. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I like the food at Chick-fil-A, but this location does not live up to its current yelp rating. The last two times I have gone here, my fries were over cooked and extremely greasy. Same thing could be said about my Spicy chicken sandwich, which just had an excessive amount of grease on it. I also don't like the ambiance at this particular location (I know it's fast food and I don't expect much), but it's always loud and the lighting is unpleasant. A tip for anyone who goes here though: order inside!!! The wait for the drive thru is always at least 10-15 mins, while there is no line inside. Park, save yourself some time, and just order to go inside. Unless you really don't feel like getting out of your car ;)"}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwich you're going to get in the fast-food world. Kids meals are good and the toys on offer are usually books or something else more interesting than a sad-ass commercial tie-in (like at McD's.) Employees who act like they're treated as something better than indentured servants.

But . . . 

Portions kinda small, prices kinda high. A good option but not quite the second coming others make it out to be."}
{"text":"I hate their business stand on civil rights, that I will never agree with! Their nuggets and ice cream, on the other hand, are delicious and their staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Hadn't eaten at this  fast food chicken chain in awhile -   Very disappointed with my chicken wrap today -   The wrap was half the size of a normal wrap  and couldn't find the chicken -  for $6.01 I could have gotten a while chicken - they gave me a lettuce wrap ;)"}
{"text":"The employees are out of this world!!! Not over the top but genuinely nice and friendly! Good chicken too!"}
{"text":"This is the fastest Chic-Fil-A around! Not only is the food tasty and fresh, but the service is SUPERB! Managers and staff communicate effectively, and they serve with a smile! :)"}
{"text":"Line was long im both the drive through and inside. We decided to eat inside. Surprisingly it went very quickly!! They gave us a colored cone. I noticed 3 different colors. We had purple. Which several other people had. As soon as we were done ordering we were approached with a small bag. Which we said was not our order. Sat down and was approached again with the same little bag by another worker. Which we again said was not our order. Color system is not good because several people had the same color. But high chair came with a new place mat they replace everytime which was great. Everything was spotless and neat. And we got OUR food soon. Chicken nugget are very tiny and we're okay. Chicken sandwhich was very good. Over good experience just not a good idea with the colors given."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this franchise, but my 3 year old daughter insisted that she go to an indoor playground.  I think it's really weird that they keep the soda fountain behind the counter.  I do have to say that their restrooms are very nice.  I've never seen free diapers in a restroom before."}
{"text":"The friendliest staff ever. This is my favorite Chick-fil-A because every time I go through the drive thru they always remember my name. One young lady always greets me with such joy. I wish I could remember her name to give her a shout out, but she is always so nice every time I am there. My food is always hot. Can't recall a time where I have had anything go wrong at this location. There is a reason why this place is so busy. Great service, great food, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great quality for fast food and great staff. I'm only giving 4 stars because I frequently see advertisements for the circus here which I don't support."}
{"text":"I am in love with chicken sandwiches so I have to say how much I love Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A sandwiches are always in my agenda. This Chick-fil-A location is about 2 miles away from my home. Whenever me and my roommates are feeling hungry. We get up we drive to this location. This location is actually one of the cleanest locations and most modern locations in all of Arizona. Their employees also seem very experienced and more in their older ages to where they have manners. When I order I normally just order two Chick-fil-A sandwich with honey mustard just to get the most bang for my buck. All sandwiches on the menu are well-prepared and delicious. Also  there dessert menu is fantastic.  They have a great ice cream sundae with melted fudge on top of it."}
{"text":"Horrible service, rude, doesn't greet customer, you can tell he doesn't like his job... I'm a loyal customer but this was the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"For fast food chain this is as good as it gets. Of course, I always crave it on Sunday when they are closed... Stick with the basic chicken sandwich and cross cut fries."}
{"text":"Let me start with the staff was pleasant and speedy. Our food order was taken immediately with a smile and brought to our table. However, this is the still the WORST Chick-fil-A I have ever been in. The chicken strips were dry and stale and the french fries tasted moldy. The store was FILTHY and the bathroom seats broken. Why has no one stepped in to fix this place? The reviews have been bad a long time. I may never go to a Chick-fil-A again. The only reason I go to Chick-fil-A is for the consistent quality of food and cleanliness in every location. If I can't count on that I will spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best chik-fil-a around. Super friendly staff, clean facility, great food!"}
{"text":"Always have been a fan of Chick-Fil-A but just don't eat here very often. Stopped by the drive thru last week and grabbed a spicy chicken sandwich, fries & Mello Yello. Any place that serves up Mello Yello gets an extra star from me. Ha! The sandwich was crispy but not as spicy as I'd like. What I normally get is the regular sandwich and add hot sauce to give it that kick. Might have to do that next time. If there was one thing bad to say about this place in general is I'm not a big fan of waffle fries. I'm just not. The service is always over the top friendly. I like that. There are plenty of other fast food places where the employees just don't care to be there. This place is different and I mean that for all Chick-Fil-A's."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Chik-fil-A food.  Staff is friendly and service is great.  Met a friend for lunch with our young boys and talked for an hour while the boys enjoyed the children's play area  A staff member came and offered to take our trays and provided us with free refills for our beverages.  Wow!  I have visited this restaurant three (3) times since relocating and have not been disappointed.  Very family friendly and service oriented.  THIS is my favorite Chik-fil-A!"}
{"text":"I'm a A-List member and I've been eating Chick-Fil-A for over 10 years and never had to to deal with the rudeness. I understand that they are young but this is a restaurant and it's a shame I've  worked in the restaurant business for year and the food quality here is poor they will serve cold over cooked fries and cold sandwiches. Last time I was there I found hair in my fries and then got a attitude from the manager because he thought I did it just for free food. I would like the see a change since I've spent over $500 and have been getting crappy food and service."}
{"text":"I feel like I have to give this location a low rating due to customer service. Obviously, Chick fil a has good quick food options although still disappointed the slaw was removed from the menu. This morning stopped by for a quick breakfast and found the car line was literally wrapped around the building so I decided to go in to order. Saw a lot of people standing around and appeared to be waiting on food. After placing my order, I stood with the others waiting on my food. When food finally starting appearing, a gentleman expressed his displeasure at the long wait time and said he would not be back to this location. Instead of providing good customer service and attempting service recovery for the long wait, Rosalia (employee) just rudely blew his concerns off and not very sincerely said we are short staffed. Shame on this location for not putting customers first!"}
{"text":"My love for Chik-fil-A is a true one, if I could eat here everyday I would. No seriously, I could eat 3 squares from this place for the rest of my life and not even think twice about it.

That being said, I have visited my share of restaurants and have to say that this location is up there when it comes to service and quickness (who am I kidding, all Chik-fil-A restaurants have great service). 

My food is always fresh and I don't think I have ever had to wait an exuberant amount of time to receive my order.

Absolutely use the app to order, they also have some great coupons!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A's set the standard for customer service and this location is no exception. I arrived a little before the lunch rush ended to pick up a rather large order. Staff was very professional and courteous through the entire transaction. While this was going on, a child threw up. The staff got right on it. No rolling of eyes, no complaining, the staff member went right to work.

 It's refreshing coming to a place like this and seeing how things are supposed to be done. As many of you know, here in charlotte, many places leave a LOT to be desired when it comes to customer service. Kudos to you, Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Great quality fast food. If you haven't tried Chik-fil-a it's worth the try! This is the 1st Chick-fil-a in the Henderson area (Now 3 in the valley) and the hype for it is still real. If you don't want to wait in long lines or drive-thru lines, you might want to wait until hype dies down. The food is great and the customer service is excellent. Hopefully they open one on the southwest side of Vegas!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is terribly slow. This is the longest I have ever sat in a drive thru."}
{"text":"I asked for extra pickles and got none. I asked for a large fry and barely got any. And the worst part... I couldn't even eat my sandwich because it tasted like rubber."}
{"text":"Horrible day to eat here today. Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and my bread was molded. My co-worker ordered a chicken salad sandwich and her lettuce was rotting. I don't like to leave bad reviews but this store needs to be more careful and dispose of bad products. This was horrifying. I'm disgusted."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and appreciative is how I would describe the employees working here. The food is always fresh and tastes great. The waffle fries are probably the best fries in the fast food industry."}
{"text":"Gave me a free chicken biscuit once, always good food.  Very friendly staff and a GREAT CONDIMENT SELECTION!  take advantage of their dippable ketchup packets and Texas Pete or Tabasco for hot sauce plus several other sauce options."}
{"text":"I love how the service is quick and everyone is so genuinely move every single time I go. They have a great system going which makes going thru the drive thru quick! I've been to this location a bunch of times and the quality of food hasn't always been the best. I understand that can be hit or miss. I just love how we finally have locations in Las Vegas.... finally!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good, I can't put into words how amazing it is...from the service to the food and milkshakes. What makes this place different from the rest is they practice Christianity and close on Sundays. I finally made time to go to this location and it tasted better today than the other times I ate here in SoCal and Utah. The sauce is what makes the sandwich ten times more amazing! Thank you Chick-Fil-A for making my Monday blues turn into a happy Monday!"}
{"text":"One of the best run in the state. (I've been to a few dozen) honest and friendly staff that will always come to your table and ask you for refills or talk about the weather :)"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, and yummy as always! 

Ordered a big order and didn't get ketchup. They had me pull up front but overall, it's Chick-Fil-A. This is the only fast food in my opinion that has consistent food. 

It's my go to for Sweet Tea and also their awesome chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Just stopped by to get me some grub,
The staff is always welcoming, like a morning hug.
The food is always hot and the taste is always the same,
Yes, Chic Fil A is that famous name.
Down the road I go and at work i will get stares,
Don't look at me like that, it's not my fault you were not there.
Thanks again for the great greeting and warm smiles,
I will take that with me today and return the favor once in a while."}
{"text":"I love this CFA! 

Despite it's kinda-crappy location right off Mill/no safe way to turn west onto University, it's what I'd expect from the chain that places an emphasis on quality + service. In the year-ish that I've lived in the area, they've done a great job updating the spot with newer fixtures, more outdoor seating, and designated bike racks.

Employees? Always nice [and not the fake nice]. 
Food? Always on-point, because you can never go wrong with anything on the menu + their amazing Poly Sauce. Foam cups are a godsend for our hot AZ days when you want to keep your beverages cold! My go-to is their southwest salad with regular chicken and ranch, or chicken strips + waffle fries + many much Poly Sauce dippers [because you can never have enough and they're currency for me]. A little pricy, but definitely worth the cost."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A and this location is no different. They are always pretty quick and their customer service is top of the line. The parking lot is pretty tricky with McDonald's and the ABC store next door so just be careful."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for 8 piece nuggets and mac & cheese. The nuggets were fine but I've decided I'm not a fan of their mac... it seems kind of oily to me. I'll stick with the waffle fries."}
{"text":"Drive thru was long, as always, so went inside. There was also a line inside and it took awhile to get up to the register. I guess Chick-fil-A is the place to go on Saturday night after some last-minute Christmas shopping. Got the 3-pc chicken strip meal. They were good, but had a couple inedible tendony bits, as they sometimes do. Waffle fries were hot & fresh. Tea was strong, but better once some of the ice melted."}
{"text":"Service and the clean maintenance deserve a 5 star. Reason I will be reviewing today is because I got breakfast for the first time a chicken biscuit and looking forward into biting into it I brought it home to eat (therefore I couldn't complain there.) the chicken was super under cooked not only did i only eat 3 bites before i couldn't take it, I got sick the next day, stomach issues the whole 9 yards. Like I Said everyone there is great just undercooked chicken isn't my thing!!"}
{"text":"My family loves Chick-fil-a, and this is probably the location closest to me, but after at least 10 visits over the past couple of years, find their service to be friendly yet slow and inefficient.  I recommend taking the 202 two more exits to Power Rd, and visiting that location.  They have consistently great service, speed, and food quality.  I've been their more times than I'd like to admit, and never had a bad experience.
In short, this is good, but great is just down the road."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Chick Filet since it opened. I have always had the best service, and have enjoyed taking my kids here over the past few years! I had never considered writing a review until tonight because it was such a terrible experience. Upon arrival at the drive-thru I noticed the girl who was taking my order clearly was not happy to be there. She sounded very unhappy and very irritated through the speaker, and when she said \"my pleasure\" it was clearly anything but. However I understand people have bad days, and I moved forward in line. I had decided to order coffee this evening, and I had asked the girl if they had coffee available to which she had replied yes. When I did get to the window they had informed that I would have to drive out front while the coffee was made. I was reluctant but I assumed with such great service in the past this would go quickly. I was wrong..I sat out front for over 10 minutes before I walked in to ask what was taking so long. While the girl who came over to me with coffee was apologetic..the woman Mikayla who was wearing a white collared type shirt who I assume was the manager just stared at me. She saw me ask about my coffee, and how I had waited. Not only did she not offer me any kind words she looked at me as though I were a major inconvenience. I was so offended at the whole experience that I decided to type this review. It was so bad that after all those great experiences this one night overshadowed them all. I hope they make some changes.."}
{"text":"The dining room is filthy. Have gotten old food multiple times. Staff is unfriendly(for Chick-Fil-A standards)
No \"thank you\"s or \"My pleasure\"s
Only received two sauces for a $30 order.
This store is the ghetto cousin of the Chick-fil-a
Family.

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I was waiting for this place to open! I'm glad it did I have been here like 5 times since it opened 3 weeks ago! I love the spicy deluxe and nuggets! Plus the staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"It's obvious the staff doesn't want to be there. I wish there was a better place to go in the area that was drive-through. Only one out of every three orders is correct. Do you want no sauce you get sauce. You want no ice you get ice. You order Coke you get ice tea. You say no pickles you get extra pickles. I would recommend going to eat any place other than this location. You don't want to eat somewhere where the staff doesn't want to work there or care about the job they do."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chick-fil-A! Service is beyond amazing, food is always tasty, the playground is clean, the employees are friendly and seem to genuinely like working here, and they put on incredible events for the community! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great staff. 

So, I decided to stop through on a Sunday while traveling cross country from Florida back home to California. Stopped in here at this Chick-Fil-A literally right across the street from ASU. 

So, the entire staff was young girls in their 20's and most likely all or most of them go to ASU. They were all very friendly and processed my order very quickly, and the food was hot and fresh (just like the staff, oh wait!....but seriously tho, they were some good looking ladies =)) 

Overall, great location all around."}
{"text":"OMG i love this place! such amazing service compared to the Chick-Fil-A's on the east coast.. Doors were opened for us, food was brought to our table and we were being checked on like we were at some swanky restaurant. This place has some great employees! I really wish there was one like this in DC/VA so I could swing by again and again."}
{"text":"My boys enjoy coming here. Today I found my chicken sandwich a bit salty. Other than that is all good."}
{"text":"Everything is always delicious!!! Staff is super friendly. There was a new hire there David, he was outstanding."}
{"text":"The wait is a nightmare in the parking lot because the line constantly goes into the street and creates a crazy amount of traffic; even with the 2 lines they have set up. Also what kind of place closes on sundays? Hey owner of Chick-fil-A, no one cares that you're Christian, get it together."}
{"text":"Ok Im going against the grain here. I really don't understand what the big deal is about Chick-Fil-A. Everybody raves about it. I've gone several times and I really dont think the chicken is that great. Yes they give you lots of choices in dipping sauce but if the chicken is so great do you need dipping sauce? The only reason why I'm a return customer is my 3 year old loves the play ground. Yes I do agree their staff is always very friendly. But the chicken never hits the mark for me Ive tried several items on the menu. Yesterday I had the spicey chicken wrap. Uh wheres the spice? Not spicey what so ever. It was loaded with lettuce and dry, I could tell it was not made fresh. My son ordered the chicken nuggets I tried one of his it was ok, didnt blow me out of the water. My son could care less what they were serving he just wanted to play. The place was busy and my food still arrived quickly. Im sure I will return if my son bags again as we drive by"}
{"text":"We love bringing our grandchildren here. They love the chicken strips and chicken nuggets and we love the sandwiches too. The staff is very friendly. They bring our food to the table and refill our drinks."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss. Cons- Orders are messed up frequently. Pros- Very clean, condiment bar always stocked, and great managers."}
{"text":"Order an eight piece nugget and chicken sandwich meal to go on a Saturday lunch hour was crazy busy as usual but staff we're very friendly and attentive my order was ready within no time even with the rush everything was fresh and hot they have the best nuggets for fast food a variety of dipping sauces to choose from like them all over experience good"}
{"text":"Great service and food tastes wonderful. This location is my go place for a warm breakfast. My nephews love the play area. I'd recommend this place to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast went inside and orders meal to go. I stopped in the bathroom. then asked if my food was ready. they said no then continued to chat with other employees. after standing there for another 8min the manager asked if I had been helped I told her yes I'm just waiting on my food. my meal.qas their the whole time the other employees were just to bussy talking to notice. the manager apologized. when I got to work I opean the sandwich to put some sause on it and there was HAIR IN MY FOOD. I just ended up tossing  it all out."}
{"text":"I was in yestarday and went through the drive through. Then girl who took my order was not friendly to say in the lest bit. Multiple times she would zone out and ask what , what , what I litterly repeated parts of my orders multiple times I would say four. I had a few questions about the menu as well when I asked it seemed to me as i annoying this young lady, with her interrupting (WHATS), scoffs and just body language. 
I was really disappointed in this employees a type of behavior. One of the reasons I love coming to Chick-fil-A Is your guyses amazing customer service. Your positive energy, smiling faces, carring nature towards your patrones and just a great environment to be in overall

Thank goodness for the lovely young woman who greeted me at the window she was definitely the Saving Grace of my experience. Very friendly and intuitive. I'm also one of those people that loves your guyses sauces to dip with my chicken and I asked for extra and she gave me a lot I was really happy."}
{"text":"The family and I were picking up our car after it received repairs at a nearby dealership.  Afterward, we were looking for a place to get a quick meal before returning to Parma.  We narrowed it down to Jimmy John's, Chick-fil-A, and Mashiso.  My family was not interested in Mashiso, so we decided to do Chick-fil-A.  We dined in and this was the first time I've actually done that.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich meal with water and wafer fries.  

The friendly server actually brought our food to our table, which was very kind.

The sandwich was very tasty, especially with the light-colored, smoky BBQ sauce I put on it.  That sauce was absolutely delicious so I dipped my fries in it too!  They need a pump so I can fill up on the sauce!  The chicken filet on my sandwich was small, but tasty.  I'm so used to huge steroid chicken breasts that when I see an organic breast, I think there is something wrong.  The food quality was very good.

My family liked their meals and my son played on the indoor playground.  

Recommend!"}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend. Just look @ tht swirl. Shoutout to the chickfila worker who just became my best friend & gave me the most beautiful ice cream."}
{"text":"I don't really care one way or the other about the food here, but my husband and daughter love it so we go sometimes. it's ok, but I don't like the play area. it's not Chick-fil-A's fault. the other kids parents don't watch their kids and my almost 2 year old daughter pays the price for it."}
{"text":"The food us very good and came out hot and fresh. The drive through line was long, but we were through it in under 8 minutes. There was a mix up with the expediting, but it wasn't major. Only issue was that all the employees were very unenthusiastic. Makes me want to go out of my way after work to another location.

EDIT 5/25: Wasn't busy. All I ordered was 12 nuggets. I got five strips."}
{"text":"While it's not the place to go for anything healthy the salads are very good and generous in size.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich that had a funky taste. The lettuce covered it like it was hiding the piece of chicken. Almost as a warning \"why are you eating the grilled chicken\" 
It just is not the place to order this item. 
It was rubbery and tasted like it was 100% rib meet. It is shaped like a breast and has lines on it like it is grilled. 4 stars for the salads, stay away from the grilled stuff and go with the signature fried stuff."}
{"text":"I want hate them because i'm liberal and dislike their BS views but these are the best chicken sandwiches i've ever had."}
{"text":"This place has good fast food, it's always clean, and the staff is super nice. SUPER nice. 

My kids love the play area and it's a lot cleaner than any other fast food play area for sure. We love this place."}
{"text":"Whoever \"Avery\" is at this location needs to relax. Ordered at the Drive-thru and he wouldn't stop rushing me to make up my mind and complete my order. Damn near gave me an anxiety attack wtf lol."}
{"text":"I was very hungry after leaving my hair appointment at Aveda on Thursday night (03 May 2018), so I hopped on in here real quick. I ordered the spicy deluxe chicken sandwich without cheese and got medium waffle fries on the side (no drink). The total was about $5. The chicken was SOoooo delicious especially because it had that spicy kick to it. It had tomatoes (or a tomato?) and lettuce inside. Just YUM!!! The fries were equally yummy - cooked well with a slight crunchiness on the edges. 

I got 2 sauces on the side and I'm not sure why because I didn't use them but I did try them. I only got them because I was asked if I wanted any sauces to go. I got the BBQ and Sriracha sauce which tasted fine. The chicken sandwich had so much flavour on it's own that there was no need for the sauce, in my opinion.

Service was great. The staff member behind the counter (Stephanie) was helpful in helping me decide what to order. I asked a few questions but she still kept a smile on her face considering it was the end of the day (around 8:45pm) and I'm sure she was tired.

Inside is huge. Lots of seating options. There seems to be a kids play area too but I only briefly glanced at it.

I hardly eat fast food but this chicken sandwich was by far the best I've ever had compared to McDonalds and Wendy's. So fresh and so good and does not seem like fast food. I wouldn't be surprised if they used mostly natural ingredients. 

If I'm ever in the area again and feel the need to grab something quick to eat then I'll be back.

This is my 95th Yelp review overall.

{"text":"This is the worst location, Chic Fil A is known for quick efficient customer service and their politeness. This location is very slow at the drive through which is disappointing since it's closest to my home. Teenagers work here and appear to have a hard time getting orders correct at the drive thru and moving the line. Do better, not living up to the reputation of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This Chic-Fil-A disappointed me! I've been a fan of this chain for as long as I can remember and was happy that upon our recent move to this part of Charlotte there was one right up the street from our home.  So imagine my disappointment when the drive-thru line was slow and the service not nearly as polite, prompt and pleasant as I've come to expect when eating at Chic-Fil-A.  I went twice in one day (breakfast and dinner), and the service was disappointing both times. What a let down."}
{"text":"One of the better fast-food places in my opinion. For the price you pay, you get a decent quality chicken sandwich. I'm not sure why people are going crazy over Chick Fil A...yup, I'm one of those people who decided to wait until the craziness has died down...or just get my Chick Fil A fix at a different city. This Henderson location is less busy compared to the one on Sahara and Rancho. Probably because this particular locations has been open for months and the other location has only been open for about a month.

I was at their drive thru which had two lines and it only took about less than 10 minutes from the end of the line til I got my food. The service is very friendly and personable. Not like most fast-food joints with employees with a nega-tude or they seem like they're always new on the job.

They have fried chicken sandwiches, grilled chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders, wraps chicken biscuits, waffle fries, sodas, milkshakes, salads, etc. I like their spicy chicken sandwich, chicken biscuits (only available for breakfast), and waffle fries dipped in garlic herb ranch sauce or the Chick Fil A sauce. Nom! Their chicken is breaded, well-seasoned and fried without being dry. Juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. 

For 3 chicken sandwiches, 3 waffle fries, and a drink - I only had to pay no more than $21. That's cheap!

For all these reasons, people go crazy and wait in eternal lines. Tips: come here at weird times and avoid weekends."}
{"text":"While a good chicken sandwich, it did not live up to the constant hype I have heard all these years. Its an ok sandwich. The waffle fries are good. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the least friendly location I've been to. I didn't get any dipping sauces with my chicken, even though I asked for it. Once I finally got the attention of an employee, they gave me one of each sauce, and one of the sauces was the wrong one. I tried talking to them again but was ignored, so I just ate the chicken without the sauce I always get with no problem at other locations. I expect more from CFA. The food itself was good, though."}
{"text":"Been here and the Stephanie location a few times now before I wrote a review.  Both locations seem to be pretty consistent.  Love the mobile app.  No waiting in line.  It's still terribly busy during the lunch and dinner hours but breakfast is always empty. Which is fine with me bc that's what I love the best lol.  One thing I wish they would do is separate the hot and cold items.  Bought an ice cream and they stacked it in with all the hot items and it completely melted by the time we got home.  It was ice cream sundae soup all over the bag and food.   Not good.  But the chicken is very moist and tender.  Spicy deluxe is tasty. Wish it was spicier.  But the real winner is the chicken minis.  Only served during breakfast.   Should be served all day imho."}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A and hate to award them only 3 stars! However I feel it is merited because this restaurant is SLOW! I have been here numerous times, and I always find that the drive through is moving at the pace of molasses. 

Yesterday I sat in the drive through line for 14 minutes for a tea. When I finally made it to the window, they handed me food and a Coke. I told them it wasn't mind and passed it back inside. 

Overall it seems this restaurant is not managed as well as many of the other Chick-fil-A stores are managed."}
{"text":"There are a lot of food choices in the Valley. Moreover, there are quite a few Chick-fil-A's to choose from. That being said, I would highly recommend you NOT spend your money at this Chick-fil-A. I ran through the drive thru one day with my kids and ordered lunch (I hadn't been to this location in years). We asked for 3 ranch and 3 chick-fil-a sauces with our meal. When we got up to the pay window the girl informed me that we'd have to pay for the extra sauces (they only give you 2). Ok, no problem. But then she rolls her eyes and gives me the snottiest attitude about it. She says \"yeah, it's because, you know, people like this (me) who order to much sauce). Ummmm....sayeth what?! Chick-fil-A is typically the Ruth's Chris of fast food but this location is more like a dirty Burger King. Take my advice and Spend your hard earned money at a different Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"This Shea Chick-Fil-a is AMAZING. They seem to always be chill and smiling and The staff and the manager are just incredible. Quick example, My husband ran over to grab lunch. He realized, when he went to pay, that he left his wallet in the office. He was mortified but the manager said not to worry, it was on them. He was really surprised since that's typically not the type of service you get in the fast food industry. He went back to his office, grabbed his wallet and drove back to pay...but they wouldn't let him.  He will literally go out of his way now to stop at this Chick-fil-a.  thank you guys and Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"If I'm having fast food this is the place.  Classic chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and a lemonade! Yum!  So glad they are expanding and I don't have to drive so far when I have a craving"}
{"text":"Went there today after I haven't been there in about 2 months tried to get my fries extra crispy they had to check with multiple people and said sorry we can't cook your fries extra crispy got my food everything was cold terrible never go back again."}
{"text":"It's always such a great to go here. I feel like the healthy choices make it seem like it's not fast food at all. My last visit I got the grilled chicken wrap and fresh fruit. It's definately my \"usual\" whenever I go to Chik-Fila. The staff is always friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"This is the first time I dined at a Chik Fill A. The qualility of the chicken sandwich was supurb! The restaurant was super clean and the people working there were very friendly and gave me free refills like a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"I am in the service.  Eating at a Chick-fil-A is always on my to do list if I am near one.

The brand delivers such consistent, well run stores... my experience has always been the same - ultra friendly, competent customer service and fresh, tasty food quickly.  I.e., I have never received cold fries from a Cick-fil-A restaurant.

5 Stars! Thanks Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"I really love the chicken and how it already comes with pickles o. The sandwich ... Fave.. I also love the buffalo sauce very addicting"}
{"text":"FOOD
I'm sorry, but if I'm going to splurge on some fast food, this is where I'm going to do it. I LOVE this chicken!!! Sure, you can squeeze a little grease out of each nugget, but it's fast food. Go peddle your diet food somewhere else! Of course, they do have some healthier items, but the \"grilled\" chicken is terrible. Plus, waffle fries! The milkshakes are good too, but they don't quite hit Steak 'n Shake levels.

SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE
Chick-Fil-A treats their employees really well. In fact, their managers are some of the highest paid individuals in the business. (Their business practices have been studied for this very reason.) This treatment trickles down to their employees creating /actual/ job satisfaction. I absolutely love dealing with the employees here! They say things like, \"How can I help you?\", \"How are you today?\" and \"It would be my pleasure\", and they mean it! To wit, they usually have someone walking around the store just asking people if they need anything, bringing out sauces, refilling drinks, and pre-busing tables.

Most of the time the restaurant is clean. As another reviewer said, this location can get really, really busy, and I think that the staff does get overwhelmed. Sometimes they need to send someone out to sweep and wipe down tables.

They have a play place for the kids. This location also has lots of fun, free events. Check out the calendar: http://www.cfarestaurant.com/thewaterfront/events. My daughter and husband attended \"Daddy-daughter night.\" They had free dinner, special games and prizes, and they came home with the most adorable framed picture."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive-thru. By far the most efficient one I've ever been through! Each point I was greeted by a cheerful smile, and they were all so helpful. Not to mention the smells are GREAT in my car, lol! Good work, team!"}
{"text":"Had Chick Fil A for the first time and did not know what to expect. We came here on a Saturday where it was really busy. It was filled with soccer kids and large group of families. An employee had an electronic tablet where she helped me and my friends when it came to ordering. Came here with a five of my friends and we decided to get the top items like the chicken nuggets and of course, the chicken sandwich. We ordered the 2, 8 count nuggets and each got chicken sandwiches. Some of us got the grilled sandwiches. All of us seemed to enjoy it. We got one of every sauce for the chicken nuggets. I personally liked the Polynesian sauce and the Chick Fil A sauce the most. 

For this location, I would have to agree with the other Yelpers. Come at unusual times to avoid the lines and avoid weekends at all costs if you don't like waiting. Drive thru can be a little hectic as well!

Verdict: I will definitely come back and try other things on their menu and will give an update."}
{"text":"To start things off my food was cold and 2 fries were missing from my order. I immediately turned around and brought it to the employees' attention. They all were having a conversation about what they planned to do over the weekend and pretty much ignored me. Then they asked me for my receipt (mind you I didn't even leave the parking lot, just whet back to the drive thru window). Story short, they DID NOT give me my missing items and told me I could leave my number for the manager. I have yet to receive a call. The absolute poorest customer service I have ever gotten!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and yummy food. But today there was little to no seating in or outside. We were able to grab a spot then dip out fast but man- our food got to our table as we were sitting down. Pretty small."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast on our way out of town.  We had the chicken biscuit and the breakfast minis.  Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious!  Would stop again!"}
{"text":"I just went through the drive thru at the 59th Ave and T-bird location. I live nearby and wanted a fast late lunch. After I ordered and pulled forward I realized my wallet was no where to be found. Embarrassed to say the least I started to explain to the cashier that I live nearby and could come back for the food and pay. Kaitlin was listening and said, \"your lunch is on us today.\" She was so kind and polite! I can't believe  how kind she was. I have had a rough day and left my brain at home. She laughed with me and handed me $15 of free food. I will be back to pay and bring Kaitlin a thank you gift. Chick-Fil-A has a totally different set of values than the world we live in. It's refreshing and I will be back, With money next time!!! Shout out to the 59th Ave employee, Kaitlin for being a bright spot in my day."}
{"text":"Customer service here is pretty good. Good for an early or late lunch, but beware the busy times!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chic-fil-A!!!  They are so nice and super friendly. That means so much in today's life. To be able to enjoy a great meal in a friendly atmosphere is wonderful!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Chick fil a is my guilty pleasure. If I am craving some fast food, chick fil a is my go to. I love their chicken strips and chicken nuggets especially with their chick fil a sauce. Their strips and nuggets are always tender, juicy, and crispy and when dunked in their tangy, honey mustardy, bbq sauce--it's just heaven. Their sandwiches are also delicious with a generous chicken breast in between buttery bread. It is not a patty full of processed meat but actual chicken. Basically, they know how to fry chicken. Also, make sure to get some waffle fries. You cannot go wrong with waffle fries. Chick fil a is always a pleasure to have once in a while."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is tops at fast-food.  I never feel sick an hour after eating at one and the food is always the finest in quality for what you pay.  Service is always friendly and courteous at every location I have been to across the country.

Atmosphere - It is in a food court with a lunchtime crowd consisting of mostly trophy wives pushing strollers.

Service - Cheerful, helpful and pleasant w/ no push to supersize (nice).

Food - I always get the classic Chick-fil-a sandwich.  There is something so gratifying in the simplicity of moist breaded chicken on a slightly buttered bun w/ two pickles.  It is excellent!!  To stay healthy and to counter the leftover Halloween candy I have been devouring this past week, I decided to skip the waffle fries and Coke and try the new Carrot Raisin side salad and an un-sweet tea.  The tea was good but the side salad was the best!!  It had shredded carrot w/ plump soft raisins and I think sweet chunks of pineapple.  If you like sweet and healthy, this is a must try and the whole reason why I am writing this review.  

Overall - I got all this tastiness in combo meal for just $5.90. 

Five fast food stars to Chick-fil-a!!!"}
{"text":"Chic fillet is always an awesome choice and this location is no exception.  Fast and friendly service for those of us on the go.  What is it about Sundays that always leaves you craving that chickeny goodness?"}
{"text":"I enjoy their food, just not the so many kiddos running around atmosphere. It's by far the worse place to eat if wanting to avoid kiddo family crowd."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Chick-fil-A.  Chick-fil-A sauce for the best fries ever is so good!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Being a new location at lunch time, I did not expect to be blown away by the quality of the food, the attentiveness of the service and the speed with which I got my food. Don't be fooled by the long lines at the counter and drive thru, because the army of friendly people the have employed will help you make it through the ordering line in less than 2 minutes. 

I ordered the #1 Deluxe, and it was awesome. Although this is a fast food joint, the food is hot, fresh and well presented. What's more, their chicken portions are huge and super juicy. I also tried the Polynesian and Chick Fil A sauce and they are TO DIE FOR. I will definitely visit again. 

Oh, and one tip- don't forget to download and use their app. They give you awards based on purchases (too bad I forgot to use mine today), and you can even order from the app and just pick it up when you get there."}
{"text":"For how busy they are, I give props to the drive thru set up! Managed to get out of there in 16 minutes. Between ordering, then paying, then getting food, and then even a separate sauce station when you pull out. Too funny. Just as good as I remember from back home. Knocked off one star because they forgot one of my sandwiches :( it was just so busy I didn't check, and wanted out of that parking lot."}
{"text":"I was in the longest lunch hour line when I was almost up next to order and realized my friend had my wallet. Instead of telling me I couldn't get anything they gave me a chicken sandwich for free. The nicest employees!"}
{"text":"Went to the  Chick-Fil-A today in Las Vegas.  We were here on opening day.  On the first day, everything went well.   Today, August 12 we stopped by for lunch to see how things were going.  As always, this restaurant was extremely busy.  
Upon walking in, the staff were taking orders with an iPad type of device.  When we arrived at the window, the order was again repeated to us ensuring that the order was correct.  

WHAT COULD GO WRONG

The order came to our table hot.   All the items were just about perfect.     The store was clean, the trash cans were empty.   

We will be back again."}
{"text":"Placed our order and all went very well. We sat down at our clean table. Meal was very good as is with all chick fil a restaurants. 

One of the team members came by our table to see if we wanted a \"refill\". I explained that chick fil a gives \"refreshes\".   This is the chick fil a policy.  

We then went to the counter for one more refresh and again another team member said \"would you like a refill?\"  

I realize this is something very small. 

The seating area was clean however they had about 40 trays on top of the trash bin"}
{"text":"I am tired of visiting this place and not being able to find not one clean booth or having to struggle to find a clean table. This has been a problem on at least two recent visits, even after calling it out to management.  Although being busy is not an excuse, they weren't terribly busy this time (no line, at 60 percent capacity), the last time it was almost empty and more filthy (interestingly the same people).  Is Chick-fil-a becoming filthy like McDonald's or Burger King?  The only reason this is a two star review and not one is because I believe I've had one fair visit."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken nugget meal today. To my surprise when I got to the destination I had everything in the bag except the chicken nuggets.  Unfortunately no time to grab lunch twice or two trips to Chick-fil-A. 

Check your order before leaving this drive-thru."}
{"text":"I have always had good service here. I had placed a catering order that somehow they lost, and they were able to turn the order around in less than 20 minutes the morning that I showed up to pick up the food. AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"For me to say \"I love chick-fil-a\" is an understatement! Anytime someone asks me what I want, that's the first thing I say! ESPECIALLY this chick-fil-a! It's amazing! The people, the drive through efficiency, the food, the precise orders! Go here! Usually, places near college towns aren't as fast and efficient as they should be but this location is!"}
{"text":"Terrible drive through service!  Ridiculous the system they have set up.  The young girl outside had no idea what they offered- I will NEVER go to this location again.  Should have gone a little south and went to the fabulous Cane's!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Chicken sandwiches, very good. I just had the breakfast chicken minis.  Awesome.   And I had a coupon, they were free no purchase nessessary.   I want to try their nuggets, strips and frosted lemonade next...and they finally opened a chick-fili-A near me"}
{"text":"It's CHIC Fil A...need I say more?  Great food and good prices...all served with a smile and its my pleasure!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Same flavor with way better dinning environment! There's a kids playground in the restaurant - not sure when it is open, and the bathroom is clean and spacious as well!"}
{"text":"This is a place that I always visit whenever I go shopping there. You can order a sandwich for a full meal or just some chicken nuggets and waffle fries for snack. I would highly recommend the \"snack\" options I mentioned above. Ask them for ALL the sauces they have and I guarantee that you will find at least one flavor that you will like. Don't worry they won't judge you cuz I do that all the time and I am sure other people must have done the same before. I particularly like the chick fil a sauce, of course."}
{"text":"First time at Chick Fil A was delicious! We went through the drive thru and had wonderful service! They helped us find exactly what we wanted. We ordered every sauce and a bunch of food! 

Their special sauce was amazing and I really liked the Polynesian sauce. I just wish they had one in Las Vegas! Hopefully I can go back someday!"}
{"text":"We came by for a quick bite after leaving the mall, of course... 

Well, quick is playing fast and loose with vocabulary... It wasn't quick, but it wasn't so long in the car that the kids that were with us had time to complain, so I guess it balanced the fine line... lol  

It's still an interesting experience inside their parking lot as previously stated, so I don't think they're changing that at all... Oh!  And if you leave the drive-thru, go to the left... The right side is a one-way, coming in that direction... Watch out there now... lol

The employees were pleasant and the food was good ol' Chick-Fil-A style, so it was still a nice visit...  Sometimes you wanna go where everybody's excited about the fact that you showed up to their job, whether they know your name or not...  That's the Chick-Fil-A way..."}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST Chik Fil-A I have ever been too. The employees have attitudes and they halfway do your food and do not give you all of your food. I went tonight got two number 2s with 2 sides of mac and cheese and baked beans. Total was $23.00.  My fault for not checking thoroughly I should have known given this ones reputation. I got home no fries and HARD green tomatoes and small chicken thrown onto my bun. If I was the owner of this one I would be upset. I tried the app to pick up I go and wait 15-20 minutes and I have to go inside and get upset then they go oh here you go. UGH SO FRUSTRATING!!! I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good fresh chicken. Recommend the chicken sandwich. Cookies are also surprisingly good and soft. They sometimes get crowded so try and get here before dinner rush. Only negative of this place is they are closed on Sundays. Other than that, they are for sure a go to a place for a good chicken sandwich. Also sign up for their text program for good deals!"}
{"text":"Tried the frozen lemonade last night and I'm a changed woman! I may never have a fast food chocolate shake again! This frozen lemonade was like a shake, but frothier, and with a nice citrus flavor. Turns out that I like citrus as much as I like chocolate; something I only discovered a few years ago. I may have led a sheltered food life until my 40's.
I also had their salad with the blueberries and strawberries. I know, I'm doing Chick Fil A wrong. The salad was a really nice surprise, especially for a fast food place.
We went to the one on Sahara and the 15. It seems to be the only one open until midnight during the week."}
{"text":"CAUTION!  Please read this review before braving the lines a chic-fil-a.  By the time you wait in line for several minutes you will be handed a bag with luke warm (steamed) in the bag waffle fries.  Then you open a (steamed in the bag) soggy chicken sandwich.  Not good I had to send it back and get my money back.
You have 3 choices: wait until the business slows down.  Make sure you have them cook your food fresh.  OR go down the street to \"Habit\" burgers they know to cook everything fresh and hot."}
{"text":"First of all, can you ever really go wrong with Chick-Fil-A? The food was delicious as usual. Chick-Fil-A is  great for people with celiac disease because the grilled chicken is gluten free, and the fries are cooked in a separate fryer from the breaded chicken so they're safe! I also suggest the Chick-Fil-A sauce, it is seriously delicious. The service was wonderful, they insisted on brewing my boyfriend a fresh batch of sweet tea for his refill when they had just run out before closing! 

Now for the real story: I'm currently on a cross country road trip from California, and we stopped here last night on our way to Lisbon. I absentmindedly left my purse on my chair after getting side tracked talking to some of the employees about different American accents. It took me until we unpacked at our hotel in Lisbon to realize I didn't have my purse (how I did that is yet to be understood)! I frantically called them at midnight hoping they were still there and that my purse was where I left it. The manager, Sara, answered and told me it was still there! We then had to figure out how I was going to get it, as chick fil a is closed on Sunday and we are heading out to New Jersey today. Sara gave me her personal phone number so we could arrange some sort of shipping deal, but then another employee, Reiley, offered to meet us half way and bring me my purse! I can't even believe how kind and generous these two were to me, and I am so so grateful for them helping me get my purse back to me. They even hid a cute plush cow in my purse! Thank you again, you are both awesome!"}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff, clean environment, tasteful deco, great tasting food, they go above and beyond to provide a superior fast food experience that rival standard restaurants with service, quality, affordability and top-notch speed. Waffle fries were excellent, were not overly salted as they are in some other comparable fast food chains. Very happy to support this Christian friendly establishment."}
{"text":"I love it!. Always fresh and hot. Nice customer service with manners! And they NEVER forget my mint!"}
{"text":"Most stores are pretty good, but this store is not one of them. The guy at the window is rude and spouts off his routine so fast you can't understand it. I came for breakfast only to find out they are not doing breakfast today due to the holiday. So I ordered a few things and a shake. After I paid he told me the shake machine isn't running yet. I'll go to a different store from now on."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and drive to Belmont! I can't believe how much of a disaster this Chick-fil-A is and more than that, I can't believe they have allowed them to continue operating providing such awful service. I can see I'm not the only one that thinks so. I picked up breakfast one morning for myself and my coworkers. It had already been a long morning and I had a meeting so I ate in the car. Little did I know, they shorted me a biscuit and one of my coworkers wouldn't be getting breakfast. The chicken minis I got were 'assemble your own', I guess. It was just a box of buns and chicken thrown in there, not together. When I called, she told me I had to come back. I explained that I drove 30 minutes to work and could not drive back. She told me I had to be in the store for them to see the incorrect order. How would I show you a MISSING biscuit. What would you like me to bring back to you? I complained to Chick-fil-A but never got my refund and I've never been back to this location and will not! It's a good 15 minutes, in traffic, down to Belmont and I'll drive it EVERY single time to avoid this Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"THIS Chick-fil-A. The new double drive-thru is almost always backed to the entrance, but they move it quickly. The food is always good and I think I've only had an incorrect order once. The only bummer on occasion is the fries. Even when they are busy, I get soggy fries. No biggie, I just get fruit instead 90% of the time. Anyone that gives this Chick-fil-A less than 5 stars has never been to Gastonia. I'll drive the extra 15 minutes every single time and honestly, will probably make that up in how long I would have been in the Gastonia drive-thru to get a wrong order. So appreciative of the way that Belmont is managed! Delicious food, great service."}
{"text":"No offense Chick-fil-A, but yelpers, I almost feel silly writing this review on a fast food restaurant but the service I receive constantly when visiting this location is above and beyond! They really must train their employees because they are all very polite, extremely bubbly and work the drive thru line efficiently. My order has always been correct and served hot and delicious! I also have the Chick-fil-A app and score free menu items! It's great! THIS location only A+!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a good breakfast. For my first time I had an English muffin egg and chicken, with hash browns and coffee. The coffee is really strong for my tastes but he muffin sandwich was really good. Excellent service and extremely friendly. I would visit here again."}
{"text":"Exceptional ... truly exceptional.  Even the general manager was working the drive thru window. during the lunch hour.  The food is always outstanding.  I had the spicy chicken sandwich and peppermint shake.  I wish they offered spicy nuggets."}
{"text":"The chicken fillet has gone on a diet.  Sad they have reduced the size of the chicken fillet on their sandwich.  Probably yet another result of ObamaCare, but the new lightweight sandwich doesn't even fill you up."}
{"text":"Breakfast at CFA.  Prompt and polite counter staff.  They mention that the order may take a moment and said they would bring it to my table, which they did with a minimal wait.  Enjoyed the chicken biscuit and a bacon, egg & cheese biscuit.  

Pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a breakfast biscuit while in the area.  Got a polite and prompt welcome from the counter person.  I was told to have a seat and they would bring my meal to me,

Enjoyed the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit.  Employee dropped by after I was done and asked if they could remove the tray and the trash.

All the other fast food chains need to take lessons from CFA on polite treatment of their customers.  I always feel my business is appreciated at any CFA restaurant."}
{"text":"The best drive thru restaurant around.  Never get sick of coming here and the service is exceptional compared to other chain drive thrus."}
{"text":"It was anniversary night at Chick-Fil-A offering free movie (Finding Nemo), popcorn, face painting, balloons, cupcakes, and FREE chicken sandwich with any purchase.  It was a fun night with my Niece and celebrating with Chick-Fil-A. I've always loved anything I've had from here."}
{"text":"Management is awful!! I complained because my food took to long and it wasn't made right. I got in a fight with the shift manager because the first words that came out of his mouth were \"what do you want me to do?\" Then when I called the store manager she actually tried defending him by saying his feelings were hurt because I used a couple cuss words. If you can't take steam from a customer you shouldn't be a manager. And when you can't hold your managers accountable for escalating tensions, then you shouldn't run the store. I called corporate and they said they passed the info to the franchise owner. Horrible store. Never going there again!!!"}
{"text":"Considering its one of my niece and nephews favorites, this place is a hit. Although the wait here sucks because they're always busy, the people are friendly. The food is consistent and good. Chick-fil-A is the last fast food place I eat."}
{"text":"Delicious! Just great food! I got the grilled chicken sandwich meal which comes with tomato and lettuce on a yummy bun with a side of phenomenal waffle fries. Hands down: the best chicken sandwich I have ever had at a fast food joint. We also got the grilled chicken nuggets with barbecue sauce on the side... so good! I got the fresh squeezed lemonade that was terrific. My friend ordered he frozen strawberry lemonade which consists of lemonade, strawberry syrup, and ice cream: really good! 
The service is very friendly. The lines are long but move fast. I am not sure about drive through.  
If you appreciate fast food as have time limits, this is a healthy and delicious alternative to fast food. 
I highly recommend this place. I am definitely going back. 
If calorie conscious, nutritional info is readily available."}
{"text":"I was nervous to come here because I've heard about the long wait times IN THE DRIVE-THRU and have seen the lines of cars wrapped around the building. But I was surprised to be pulling up to order right as the car in front of me was leaving. I was in and out of the drive-thru within 5 minutes. Granted, I came at 8am for breakfast... keep that in mind lol. 

The staff was very friendly when I ordered and when I pulled up to the window. 

I order a 4pc Chick-n-Mini with zesty buffalo sauce -- I don't understand why people like the Chick-fil-A sauce so much... the buffalo and the ranch is much better. I was only expecting one sauce because there are only four biscuits but I got two! That made me happy lol. 

I think I'll wait a couple more weeks before I attempt coming for lunch. That line still looks crazy and I don't think Chick-fil-A is worth a 20 minute wait in the drive-thru."}
{"text":"3 stars merely for their ok customer service - which I will mention in my opinion consists of many things, one of them being the appearance of food they are handing to a paying customer. I've probably been to this location a dozen times in the last 4 months I've been in Surprise. In those dozen times, I've had 2 solid visits. I went last week and waited 16 minutes for 2 - 4 piece chicken strip meals. While they were hot and delicious when we got them, 16 minutes is a lifetime in the fast food industry. 7 cars passed through the drive-thru before I was finally told it would be another minute longer. I'm sorry but c'mon. I chose to walk in because there was not a single person waiting for food/ordering. I went through the drive-thru today because I fugured it was quicker.  I had to wait to get my order taken, although there was 1 car in front of me. When I received my food, my 'large' fry was more of a medium. They were soggy, old and just no good. I've given up on this location. You can either wait forever for good food or you can get through like lightening and get lazy. I love Chic-fil-a, they're number 1 in the US for a reason but this location needs to re-evaluate."}
{"text":"This Chick Fil-A experience can't be compared to any fast food service I've ever had, nor expected.  

Around noon on a weekday, I pulled in to see that there were 10+ cars in line at the drive through.  I had already mentally committed my taste buds to some Chikn Nuggets, but thought about leaving since that's not the easiest food to eat on the road.  But then, like an angel coming down, I saw a sign for dippable ketchup containers; equal to 3 packets of ketchup.  And since I eat like a toddler and only want my nuggets with ketchup, this sold me to stay in the line. 
I approached the window to order my meal, when I got the bad news their fountain drink systems were down.  Even though this would have normally angered me, the apologetic woman working the window made me at ease about having to drink lemonade with my meal.  They are very kind, courteous and profession young adults working here, which is rarely seen anymore.  

The way Chick Fil-A runs their company is amazing and I wish more places took the time and money to train their employees in this manner.  It's reason enough to return again and again."}
{"text":"What can I say this place is great in my opinion way better then raising canes the chicken here are more moist then raising canes and to top it off I love there milk shakes and not the mention frozen lemonade!! Lines are super long . so quick tip dine in you'll be in and out and the best part is the workers will refill your drink get you whatever you need . You will never have to get up and get your own drinks or sauce if you haven't tried this place then your missing out !! Rip raising canes"}
{"text":"Wow, I have been ordering lunch delivery for years spending $250 per occasion.  My attendees love Chic Fil A.  Suddenly they decided to raise the limit to $300 minimum for a delivery.  Very disappointing!  I guess they must be doing well enough to not want my business.  Hope the other locations have not followed same protocol.  I spend about $1500 per month at Chic Fil A valley-wide.  Sorry for your decision."}
{"text":"The food is great , service is exceptional... Unfortunately it appears to be at the expense of the employees who are forced to stand outside in 100 plus degree weather and take orders- even though there is a perfectly functional \"squawk box\"... It's sad that they choose to deliver a great level of service by putting their employees health at risk. When I asked about this (I talked to some one I'm assuming was Management) I was told \"that's what they signed up for\" I've read the application and NO WHERE does it say anything about 100plus degree heat... I'm boycotting until I see changes made...and urging everyone I know to do the same. A great sandwich isn't worth someone's health!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch and the local school had early release so it was a bit crazy inside. The manager was so nice and paid for my meal even though I did not ask or complain at all. That's what I call amazing customer service and making the most of a busy situation. Thank you Chickfila."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a in general has the best customer service across the board but today they've outdone themselves.  Not only was the staff extremely pleasant with their positive attitude and making things fresh, but Jesse, one of the team members came across the food court to offer to fill up a lemonade and then took all of our trash from the table.  What other food court establishment has employees willing to do that?!?!  I have read a few of the reviews and of course it is a couple extra minutes to actually make the items fresh when they haven't been sitting out all day.  That's one of the things I love about chick-fil-a, you pay a little more but you get such a better experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. This is my first Chick Fil A experience and my food was cold! Fries clearly have been sitting around the chicken stale as can be. I will never return. The rants about this place being amazing is way over rated!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon card that was invalid and was turned away, but one employee (named Genesis) overheard and hooked me up with a free meal. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I go to Chic fil a probably 3 times a week and i have to say this is the best one in town. At this location they always make their meals fresh and everything tastes better."}
{"text":"Rarely eat at any Chik-Fil-A.. but when i do it's always good.

Now theres a chikfila less than a mile from my office, so i decided to stop by for lunch today. Got the 8 piece chicken nuggets- my first time ordering them, my only complaint is that they are kinda smalll.. but really good! next time ill get the 12 piece

love their waffle fries.. i dip them in mayo too.. yum..

No drink cuz i have a can of Rootbeer in my office waiting for me..

total meal was $5.02 not bad... i know chikfila can be expensive but if u have your own drink it can be a $5 meal.. You can make it happen :)

the best part, FRIENDLY service! I was greeted by the mop guy with a smile and a \"how are you\"-  i'm from NYC, no one says HI there.. (now u know why i moved to arizona in September)

The guy taking my order was cheerful too, he got my food in a Jiffy! KUDOS"}
{"text":"Great food, service is always quick and the employees are kind and helpful. Whenever there is a mistake made to an order, which is rare, they happily fix everything with no extra charge. I always look forward to visiting!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, the people and the yummy food. Thank you Troy for opening this location so close to our home.  God bless you!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Wish it was open 7 days a week but it's not. Chicken sandwich is the bomb and their fries are way better than McDonald's! Fast service through drive through. They could give out more sauces when asked for them through the drive through, only got 1 of each sauce which was disapointing but nothing big since my meal was small. Portions are very filling."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times through the drive thru mostly. The employees are all very friendly but almost every time I have ordered it has taken over 5 minutes, sometimes 10 if there is a long line, just to get my food. I understand some places get busy but for the times that there is only 2-3 cars in front of me and it take 10 minutes for me to get my food that's a little bad. Also, when I ask for 2-3 sauce every single time I have gotten the wrong amount. Either 1 of each of I don't get any sauce at all. I get we as customers have to get charged and I am willing to pay the fee for extra sauce but when I say I would like 3 ketchup packets and I get 1 it makes me not want to even eat the food I just paid for."}
{"text":"They've been open (FINALLY) less than a month, and they are super busy. However, they had people directing traffic out in the parking lot and taking orders.  We chose to use the mobile app for ordering on our way. When we walked in a woman came out and said \"mobile order for Vickie?\" and handed me our order.  There were plenty of tables and we enjoyed our chicken sandwiches. It's the only chicken breast sandwich that isn't dried out. Way to go Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"We had a free breakfast item here for having the mobile app. We usually get the chicken biscuits which are great, but we decided to try the egg white grill and the hash brown scramble bowl. Both were delicious and I think I liked them more than the chicken biscuit. I'll definitely be changing up my normal breakfast order now."}
{"text":"Don't miss the best breakfast in town! Free Chick-fil-A breakfast. Delicious chicken minis. Free. I love Chick-fil-A! 10 Stars!"}
{"text":"Another stop on the Chick-fil-A tour for my daughter. \"Do they have Chick-fil-A here?\" is always the first question asked if she's in a new city and lucky for her, there was one located two miles from the hotel.

Our first meal in Phoenix was no different than any other great experience we've had at Chicken-fil-A. This restaurant was clean and a little bit on the noisy side with kids playing hard in the play area and some running through the restaurant. The service is always friendly with employees offering to refill drinks and clearing the table of any unnecessary items. The chicken is consistently made the same and delicious as always.

Four combo meals to feed five set us back an affordable $39 and we left pleased after another satisfying visit. Where the next tour stop will be is yet to be determined but my daughter will always be on the constant search."}
{"text":"The foods always good but this is slowest moving drive thru I've ever been thru. It's never a quick trip if you go thru the drive thru here. I've ordered and have been in the drive thru for ten min and I'm not even close to the window. On a positive note, they have never gotten my order wrong and it's always clean when you go inside."}
{"text":"I live out of state in a small town where there is only a handful of food places so every chance I get I make it a point to come to a Chik Fil A!! Great fresh food and great service!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Chick-fil-A but this particular location is always super crowded, with wrap around the building twice lines! 

Their saving grace is that the lines move fast with the help of the outside personnel who take orders, direct traffic and keep things moving smooth! 

Even with the chaos and lines they still manage to offer great hot food and service with a smile!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A! The food is always hot and fresh and the employees always have a great attitude. Well I'm not sure what happened today because they were not their usual jovial selves! No smiles and they practically threw my kids meal out of the drive through window! 

The kids meal chicken nuggets were room temperature and one was so flat it looked like a mini pancake! I did call and spoke with the manager Eric who offered to replace the entire meal with no problem!"}
{"text":"Visited this location a few weeks ago only to receive a completely wrong order. And, whatever it was that I received was not even edible - I took one bite and threw away. And, as you know Chick-fil-A is not cheap, so I spent $7 on nothing! I immediately sent an email and still haven't heard anything from them. Way to go on the customer service! Even McDonalds responds!! NEVER GOING TO ANOTHER CHICK-FIL-A!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff!  Great customer service-- Bodhi was incredibly polite and professional!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Chick-Fil-A fan to begin with, but this location is the best! The building is brand new and is always clean. The staff members are kind,  friendly, and they go above and beyond to make sure that every customer is satisfied. My friend and I went to get lunch a few weeks ago, and although we didn't think the wait was very long, we had an employee (manager, maybe?) come over and apologize for the wait and gave us some coupons to use on our next visit. Talk about all-star service!"}
{"text":"As someone who spends a lot of time in the south I was excited for Chik Fil A breakfast by my hotel. Chicken minis are awesome and these did not let me down. What did let me down was the service, I waited at the counter for about two minutes before anyone came to help me. After that the employee rang up my order wrong (he did yell in the back to tell them to fix it). Still love the food and this was good but they should go hang out in Georgia to see how a Chik Fil A should run."}
{"text":"Terrible First Experience! 

Ordered several items with my sisters in the drive thru. Paid the gentleman working outside and proceeded to pick up at the window. Before exiting I made sure to double check to see if we received everything. Of course, we were missing an item..

1 small fries. No big deal right? Ha! Guess again!

Went and parked on the front and one of my sisters went in to ask about the missing item. I already had a feeling they were going to be difficult and looked for the receipt, then realized the gentleman outside probably didn't give it to us. 

Of course my sister returns and says they require a receipt to show proof of order.

 For a small fries? It's not like we're saying we're missing 3 chicken strip meals and 2 large fries. 

So I had to walk ALLLLL the way around back to the drive thru Area, find the gentleman and ask for our receipt he didn't give us. His reasoning was \"oh the receipt printed before you arrived to me. I just added it to my stack\".  Walked ALLLL the way back inside and asked for the manager. This was absurd!

ZACH JONES came out without a smile and gave a flat hi . I told him the scenario we just went thru, to get a get a receipt and prove to them they did not give us ONE SMALL FRIES. He looked at me UNAPOLOGETICALLY and said \"well that's our policy.\" I felt so profiled , like oh this he/she/it is just trying to get some free food. The way he stared and seemed like judged me was so uncomfortable. He scrutinized the receipt, like to make sure the date was correct or something and thru a fry in a bag. Didn't even say sorry for the inconvenience.

So if they don't give you a receipt, and you order is incorrect/missing items, how does that work? Every guest should be required to get their receipt in that case! 
What if the employee threw away the receipt? Is there no receipt history you can look up? Why does the guest have to go thru an obstacle course to prove your mistake. 

Some places say if you don't get a receipt your meal is free.

Well at the Chick Fil-A  drive thru if you don't get a receipt and your order happens to be wrong here's the proper procedure.

First you have to first park, get out, go inside and be told by the employees you need to show a receipt to get the correct stuff you paid for, walk to the back to the drive thru Area and have the employee shuffle through receipts to find yours, walk back and speak to a rude manager, get your missing stuff and go home. By then your food is cold and isn't even worth everything you just went through. 

Luckily I still have my receipt. I will definitely be reaching out. I was so excited to try their food.. shame"}
{"text":"I live close to this location and go through the drive-thru at least once a week. Their customer service is always top notch! Very friendly and welcoming. Even when it's busy, the cars go through quickly with the help of many employees working the drive-thru. Never had any issues with the service or my food orders and will happily recommend this location to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chick-Fil-A I have ever visited and I have been to a lot. It is run very poorly. Management does not appear to care about customer satisfaction at all. They are not willing to work with dietary tastes and restrictions. Apparently they don't care what their customers want and their employees overall just do not appear to be very happy. I will drive the extra couple miles to go to the store on Power. It is worth the extra time and gas money to be respected as a customer!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chick-Fil-A in this area. Employees very friendly and polite, as well as respectful. Seems like there must be great management here overseeing the employees as they all appear happy to work here and are very helpful. They had quick service, play area was very clean, restaurant extremely clean and food made perfectly. I came with a coupon and they were more than happy to accommodate my food and drink preferences. Highly recommend this location. I haven't had a bad experience here!!"}
{"text":"Pretty Awesome place! 
It's very difficult to hide the label: FAST FOOD, but i think chic-fil-a does a pretty good job trying. The place is always clean and the service is really nice by everyone working there. I don't really go to places like this, but this was a warm welcome! Go here if you want a \"healthier\" alternative to most fast food places while not giving up taste, quality, and service"}
{"text":"consistant,delicious, addicting, and cheap. How can you not go to the place where the chicken sandwich was invented.
 (atleast that's what they claim) No matter what chick-fil-A you go to in any state it is always delicous. Try not to go on a Saturday afternoon it will be swamped with kids.unless you like kids running all around you when you are trying to eat."}
{"text":"This is one chain fast food place that I can't seem to steer clear of for some reason.  And I always order the normal sandwich.  Why change perfection?  Service at this location is quick and friendly.

Only thing to mar my experience was a shirtless guy and what looked like his mom wearing a too short skirt who sat down grumpily and yelled the \"s-word\" so loudly that it echoed into the kiddie play area.  I think I even saw a little girl faint in there. My appetite waned for a little until the delicious smell of the chicken sandwich wafted back to my nostrils.  I guess the food's too good for bad scenery to even stop me from chowing....although I did scarf as fast as possible so I could leave.

I mean, I know I'm not eating at a four star restaurant, but...decorum!"}
{"text":"This location is always packed, so I was prepared for a wait, but six minutes for the grilled chicken nuggets wasn't worth it. They forgot to put my sauces in the bag, and I was running too late to go in and get them."}
{"text":"It was good. Nothing too exciting about chick fil a. I don't see the fascination that everyone sees it's just chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. Don't get me wrong it was good and I love the fries but there's not a whole lot of food selections for me. But overall food was good and I went on the night of a gathering for green valley high school and it was awesome to feel welcomed when walking in. Staff is nice and love the service"}
{"text":"My grandkids love Chick-Fil-A.  I take them usually every 2 weeks or so.  The food is always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly and quick. My order always is correct. Even the food is amazing. If you never tried Chick Fil A I recommend you at least try it once... p.s get the sauce! They have plenty varieties. My favorite is the #2 with the dipping Chick Fil A sauce and siracha sauce."}
{"text":"The drive thru is so incredibly slow and service not nearly as good as all other chick  fil a locations.  Very poorly managed."}
{"text":"I've been dining at this location since it opened. It has been consistently good. Always clean and the food is always fresh.  Thanks for being a place I can trust."}
{"text":"Waffle looking fries were cold and the chicken was dry."}
{"text":"Literally one of the fastest and friendliest chick fil a I've ever been to the customer service was amazing if I lived closer I would go here every day!"}
{"text":"I was helped by Micah today and his customer service skills were great! Not only that but the cob salad I got was amazing!"}
{"text":"Easily hurt writing this review but this is mainly targeted to the corporate office. I had a mobile order during a snow storm but the store said it was open on the mobile app. I went and proceeded to purchase my meal but drove to find out the store was obviously closed. Chick-Fil-A was quick to take the money out of my account and it took them nearly a WEEK for their store managers or the corporate office to refund my money with no issue of a sincere apology or maybe a free chick fill a sandwich. Please improve this"}
{"text":"Always busy here...but fast service, clean place and friendly staff. Great for a quick lunch while running errands.  The drive in line is always busy too...but they do a good job of moving everyone through."}
{"text":"I like Chick-Fil-A. They deserve props for inventing the chicken sandwich, for the cute cow commercials and for maintaining their religious principles. That said, I don't really care for this location. It's cramped, with a lot of tables and a children's play area crammed into a very small space. Also, no way to refill your soda on your own. Chick-Fil-A overall is a bit expensive for what it is, perhaps in part a consequence of its closed on Sunday policy.

I tried their grilled chicken nuggets a la carte on my recent visit. How disappointing. They came out soggy, sealed in a plastic container, where they had apparently been for quite some time. Gross! Gross! Gross! Definitely no resemblance to the promotional photographs! When I mentioned how disgusting they were to another family member, they immediately asked, \"Did you go at lunchtime?\" \"They make bigger quantities in advance at lunchtime and the food then is never as good.\" Hmm. Makes some sense, I guess. Still, over five bucks for six tiny slime covered grilled nuggets and the smallest small sized soft drink I've seen in years, leaves me less than enthusiastic in any case. Plus, call me silly, but I like to eat lunch at lunchtime."}
{"text":"First timer here, and will be a repeater! We got a spicy deluxe, some breaded nuggets, and an original combo. Chicken portions were large and juicy. Fries were soft, not crispy, but still tasted great. I wonder if that is just their style? Or if it was a fluke? Oh well, we enjoyed them. We got to try all of the sauces too which was great. We're used to McDonald's only giving you 1 sauce for 20 nuggs! The staff was SO friendly, and came to check on us and refilled our cups even though we dined outside. They were really happy to be there. The drive thru lines were incredibly long, but there was just a few people in line inside, and our orders came out fast and fresh."}
{"text":"I've always heard of Chick-Fil-A from friends and family in California. I'm a Canes fanatic I thought it couldn't be better than Canes, no way! I ignored the Henderson location until the one in Rancho and Sahara opened. It's still a far drive from my place but I said, what the heck I want to check out what the buzz is all about. 

We went there after a little past 8pm on a Friday night, we were prepared to wait forever but surprisingly there wasn't any line for dine in, but the drive thru was very busy. 

For a fast food chain, they have a very fresh quality food. I ordered the Spicy Deluxe and it was really good. The waffle fries was a little undercook for me so next time I'll order them well done/extra crispy. The service was very fast and the staff are super friendly. The fine in area is also clean. Just FYI, the drinks are behind the counters next to the register, but you do get refills for as many as you want.  And the staff are very good with checking on you if you need any refills or extra sauce. My favorite dipping sauce is their Garlic Ranch. 

Will definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"Remember to ask for the food fresh otherwise it probably sat in the heater for a while and you can definitely taste the difference. Otherwise love the crew nd great service"}
{"text":"No problems here!  My order was correct and delivered within 2 minutes.  I had grilled nuggets with a side salad. It was super busy when I arrived but the line was short and moving fast. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Better than the one in Willoughby and Mentor Ohio.   I've always been obsessed with the chicken mini biscuit breakfast sandwiches.   Yumma for fast food.  STOP opening these non west coast restaurants in the west coast.  It's ruins it when I go home!!  Lol.  That's my only complaint!  Can I purchase in bulk the honey BBQ?!?!"}
{"text":"Dear Chick-Fil-a, if you are going to change your menu to now include on  the number 2 both the spicy deluxe and regular spicy you need to have you cashiers ask which the customer wants especially when you display the Deluxe on the menu and as the top item... thanks for the wrong order!!!"}
{"text":"Not great, but not a terrible chick Fil-A restaurant. As opposed to the other reviews who were displeased with the customer service, I sort of disagree. The employees have always been courteous and friendly to me. I do however agree with the complaints regarding the time it takes to get your food from the drive through. During peak hours you might find a 25-30 minute wait (I can't comment on the wait for dine in, as I've rarely used it). I would say the food quality is about on par with the other Chick fil-A establishments. If another Chick Fil-A restaurant opened closer to me, I wouldn't maintain a loyalty to this one, but it's acceptable as is."}
{"text":"This is a really good chickfila. However the parking is a nightmare, however, it's being remodeled soon...so we'll see how that turns out! The employees are great and the food seems well-cooked compared to the WT Harris location. I'll be sad while it's closed. They need another location in Huntersville - like Birkdale :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Chick-fil-A over this side of town. They actually bread their chicken correctly (my in law owns a Chick-fil-A) and the service is great! It's not the easiest one to get in and out of but neither is the Rea Rd one. The new chicken scramble is so good!"}
{"text":"I love chickfila but this was not a good experience. Very slow service, order was incorrect, employee was stone cold. My husband spent more time waiting at the counter for anything than at the table."}
{"text":"Great food!  The customer service can not be beat anywhere!  No matter where we have gone every time the food and service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Chick-Fil-A.. BUT this location needs some work. After the 4th visit today, the drive-thru team is rushed and impersonal and doesn't care to listen to what we ask for. They have messed up 2 out of the 4 orders, and they don't take the time to make sure it's right. When I asked for additional sauce they say oh it's in there, when in fact it's not. The other location at Shea and 101 is by far better customer service and always cares on what we ask for-and checks. Wish this location would get it together!"}
{"text":"A great new addition to ASU's neighborhood! This location is new, very clean and kinda stylish even. There is a neat little patio outside that would be a great spot for lunch with friends or even a short business meeting. Inside there are many seating options and it's a decent size, probably able to handle a crowd after a football game or night out on Mill Avenue. I love Chick-fil-A! Just pray and wish and hope you don't crave this delicious fried chicken snack on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, I love Chick-fil-a. The service at this location is good, had an issue with an order here and there but they are willing to fix it. I am not as sold on their breakfast menu as the day time options are much better."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A. I love your strawberry milk shake. It's crave worthy, with its little specks of strawberry that makes me believe this must be real...I also love your waffle fries, which I just recently learned isn't patented by you.. bc I found some at Mr. Hero's..but I digress. I'm so glad that even as I've moved several states away, to Ohio from VA, you are still right around the corner and some things never change.. like your cheerful greeting and warm farewell. You never cease to take my order  with great patience and you never reply to my \"Thank you\" with an  \"uh-huh.\" 

Yes.. Noted.

The only thing that keeps this location from the five stars among fast food chains is that on two occasions they forgot a condiment item in my bag..which I'm sure happened unintentionally, I mean, the staff are just soo sweet.. but do double check before driving away Yelpers. It was once a salad dressing missing and the other time my precious honey mustard sauce.

Oh, precious honey mustard sauce."}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken Sandwich Deluxe, well for fast food it is better than Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich taking over the fast food crown

You could do a lot worse fast food wise"}
{"text":"I went early morning around 7 am as I work near by. Not long wait at all obviously since they just opened at 630 and who's up that early haha. But the service in drive thru was wonderful! So pleasant and patient and I was being a pretty annoying customer as it was my first time and I was ordering for a friend over the phone and I had lots of questions but still employee remained very upbeat and not annoyed at all!! Food was yummy and filling. For 2 meals paid 12$."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly! Everyone who works here is warm, helpful and have big smiles. I like the location a lot as it's in Miracle Mile. 

Food is great but perhaps not quite as crispy as the ones in the airport for some reason. Flavors are still good and sauce is the same. The condiment section is generous! There are even individually wrapped after dinner mints!

Every time I've visited this location it's just been PACKED. Maybe it's just a Pittsburgh thing where traffic is bad everywhere and people love fast food. I dunno. I rarely get fast food and when I do, I have to wait in a line of 40 people on a Tuesday afternoon...such is life, though. That being said, can Golden Mile Highway replace its Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's with Popeyes, KFC and Chick Fil A? Priorities!"}
{"text":"I am not a chick fil a fanatic but only had it once before from someone who got me a sandwich. I did eat here today with coworkers and boy it is good. I had the spicy deluxe chicken sandwich meal. Waffle fries were perfect crispness. Spicy chicken had right amount of  spice and bun tasted fresh. I liked their signature sauce. Price is not bad at under $10. The restaurant was clean which to me is important. A lot of fast food places don't keep their tables clean but they do. They brought food out to me as well. From the moment I was in to the moment I was leaving all employees were friendly and asked if I liked it or needed anything. Service plus good food means I am a fan of chik fil a."}
{"text":"The lines are usually around the block after work at this location.  They have the associates standing out to take orders to speed up the ordering process, and while that may help it is still a ridiculously longer than normal wait time.  

I ordered a grilled deluxe sandwich with pickles and no tomato.  Guess what I got?  A very, cold slab of salty meat, no pickles and nothing but tomatoes!  I wasn't gonna wait on that building wrapping line.  
      I threw most of it away and I hope to get full off of the delicious lemonade and bland waffles fries.  

I also wanted to try the Orange Sunrise shake that is advertised all over their establishment, but guess what....  
     Yup, they didn't have any orange juice and was unable to make it.  

Unwittingly, I paid $8.00 to be part of their test market for chicken ice pops.  The disgusting summer dessert, that nobody ever wanted."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast the other day.  I love their biscuits!  I got a chicken biscuit and a 4 piece Chick Fil A chicken minis.  Total was just a bit over 5 bucks.  Here is how they were..........

Chicken Biscuit- Delicious!  My favorite thing from this restaurant.  I prefer it over their chicken sandwiches and everything else.  The biscuit is soft, buttery and delicious.  The chicken is always prepared perfectly.  I should have gotten 2 of these.  You will see why, next.

Chick Fil A Minis-  Eh...they were just alright.  A bit skimp for the price.  The \"buns\" they use for these things are like cinnamon rolls without the heavy icing.  They are kind of hard to describe.  I didn't really enjoy them though.  They had an almost \"stale\" taste/texture to them.  The chicken pieces were super skimp too.  I almost guarantee that those 4 mini pieces of chicken didn't add up to/equal what is in their biscuits.  I would not get these again.

Service is always friendly.  They are sincere and treat everyone well.  This place is pretty close to my house so I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A.  Also known as \"Billy's favorite restaurant!\".  My kid loves this damn place!  He is a pretty picky eater, but he will eat some nuggets and waffle fries any day of the week!  

We were down at Children's Hospital getting a X-Ray, and I decided to take my son here for some lunch.  It was only a few blocks away, and I knew he would love it.  It was a little busy in the parking lot (Close to 12 Noon), but we found a spot and headed on in.  

As soon as we got in the place, we were welcomed by the friendly cashier.  I placed our order for a #5 Combo and I got myself a chicken sandwich, too.  Paid the man my money and when I was asking for my sauces, he even recommended his own favorite (Honey BBQ) sauce and told me how good it was.  I took him up on his offer (turns out it is pretty tasty!), grabbed my plastic table marker and was about to go grab a seat.  Here is where this place gets 5 stars......

Before we could even sit down, there was a lady coming out with our food on the tray.  Literally, one minute after I placed the order, our food was ready!  She saw I had my son in tow, so she offered to take our food to the table for us.  I got up to get a high chair and she even offered to get that for me!  I got us all set up and one of the workers there came up to say hi to my son.  Billy is a bit shy at first, but he eventually gave her a high five.  She came back a few minutes later with a toy!  It was a little stuffed cow!  I was incredibly impressed with their hospitality and generosity.  

Chick-Fil-A always has nice workers and great service, but this place went above and beyond!  Every person I encountered was awesome!  The food tasted great as usual, too!  I will definitely head back here anytime we are down near Camelback and 16th!"}
{"text":"Was out and about and decided that I needed some protein, fast!  Stopped by here and went inside and ordered a 12 piece Chick-Fil-A nuggets.  Was helped by a nice young gentleman named Timothy (Best name ever, lol!).  Had my order of nuggets in literally 30 seconds.  Grabbed some napkins and Buffalo sauce and headed out to my car.

The nuggets were great as usual.  12 bite sized pieces of goodness.  When is Chick-Fil-A not good?  Their nuggets are perfect!  Breaded perfect, great crunch, moist in the middle etc.  Can't think of a better chicken nugget out there.  Their Buffalo sauce is tangy and makes a good dipping sauce.  

Friendly service, great food (as always) and consistency will always keep me coming back to Chick-Fil-A.  I even scored a free chicken sandwich coupon for doing their online survey.  I love when my receipt has one of those on it ;-).  Good times!  If I'm ever on the 10 and want some tasty chicken nuggets, I know where to come."}
{"text":"Wow! This is the first time I've been to a Chick-Fil-A and was able to park right in front of the entrance, no wait. Although it was still fairly busy, we were able to get in and out quickly. My boyfriend and I came in at 11:30am on a Saturday, ordered through the mobile app (which we always do every time we go here) and I waited only a few minutes until I received our order - 3 spicy sandwiches, chicken nuggets, and large fries. As always, the workers are always friendly, they consistently check up on us while we eat, and they make sure to keep their dining area clean by regularly coming around to pick up trash."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until I landed in Charlotte.  Great sandwiches at good prices.  Clean establishment and friendly, helpful staff.  Not a fan of waffle shaped fries though..."}
{"text":"Yummy fast food, hope they get more locations in Vegas since it's a little far from me.  Will definitely stop in when on that side of town. 
Kind of wish their play place was bigger."}
{"text":"Food is what you'd expect it to be.   What is even better is the service here.   The manager that runs the place knows how to get good workers.

It just wish that they'd be more open minded on the politics."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience today(Thursday 11/30). Food was delicious and hot. Bethany took our order with a smile and was very friendly."}
{"text":"I love all Chickfila due to the good food, quickness and the professionalism. This store was very low on the professionalism. Their microphones were overlapping on voices.I pulled up and when I told them they had a problem with the headsets Putting through two voices they just looked at me. Ok that's fine but then the girl with the brown braided head band was more interested in gossiping than my order. Had to ask for sauces (chickfilas everywhere else always ask first) and then I had to interrupt her mid gossip to remind her to get ketchup. They didn't even say thanks our bye. So rude. Never again!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever tried a Chick-Fil-A and this won't be my last. This was the first meal of our road trip to Minnesota. I told my friend we are eating at places that we do not have in Western New York. One of the places was Chick-Fil-A.

i bring out my trusty yelp App to see where is the nearest place for a Chick-Fil-A.. Alas, it brought me to this location.

This location was at the corner of two streets and its visible from the street. You didn't need to drive around to find this place, its just right at the corner. Nicely placed.

My first impressions of the place when pulling up and walking is that its new and very nice and very clean.

Since this was our first stop of our trip. I needed to use the bathroom. To my surprised it was very very clean.

It was my first time there and wasn't sure what to order. So i told them, i\"m from Hawaii and its my first time ever to a Chick-Fil-A. I asked her whats the top three selling items and she suggested a chicken sandwich since it was my first time. So i went with the spicy chicken sandwich. They also compd my meal because it was my first time there.

Everything about my meal was TOP notch. The fries was fresh and it looked like it was cut from a whole potato and was cross cut. Its the first time I had that type of fries at a fast food joint.

Next was my chicken sandwich it was DELISH!! I wish it was a little bit spicier but I guess they have to cater to the taste buds of americans but I wish it was more spicy. The chicken sandwich was really m

I will for sure make it a point to always go to a Chick-Fil-A when I'm close by one and try other items on the menu.
oist and very tasty.

Over all my experience at a Chick-Fil-A was top notch and wish I could give it more stars that 5 because they deserve it."}
{"text":"Awesome as always !!!   Just opened today and it's packed.  With the large crowd, they are moving us quickly."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the grilled chicken and fruit salad. It is low cal if you use the low cal dressing and very filling. The staff will go out of their way to get things right- and make your experience a positive one.  I buy the nugget trays too when I am having guests and it is always the first thing to be finished."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a couple coupons for free drinks and sandwich. The service here was impeccable, from the friendly cashier to the assistant managers who went around ensuring that we got our food and were satisfied. To top it off, the bus boy who was cleaning off the tables was offering to get customers some sauce that he overheard them wanting. I left very impressed by the attentive care of the entire staff. Well done! 

The blended ice coffee I got was delicious. Smooth and slightly bitter with the perfect touch of sweetness."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Chick-Fil-A! From line to food was only 18 minutes. The drive through moves quickly and the employees are super friendly! Ryan, our order expert, was quick to offer suggestions & they were perfect! The food is delicious and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Has one of the best tasting chicken sandwiches--as long as you get the original chicken sandwich.  The chargrilled sandwich is just okay--although more healthy, it's nothing compared to the fried goodness of its counterpart.  Waffle fries are delicious, lemonade is actual lemonade....just lemons and sugar.  They are very family friendly with snacks for the kids while you wait, free diapers in the bathroom, and ice cream with the kids meal.  Fruit is always nice instead of fries, but the fruit, unfortunately is not the freshest.

The staff is always polite and courteous...I always have to do a double-take when I hear, \"my pleasure\" when thanking them.  You don't hear the too often from other fast-food restaurants.  Although I may not agree with some of the corporate's stances on social issues, I never hesitate to take my kids there because I know it's one of the few place I can take my kids out to eat.  They love it."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times. They have always provided great service and have been extremely helpful and caring. I stopped in today and they are giving free coffee the month of February so I got one of those along with my chicken breakfast burrito. The burrito was great as was the coffee. So far only the Chandler location seems to be better than this one and that isn't by much. Would definitely recommend it over the McDonald's that is by it. for a better breakfast and way better chicken sandwich. Not to mention the delicious waffle fries paired with fantastic Chick-fil-A sauce."}
{"text":"Soooo this location is even better than the one in Superstition Springs. They also have a play place, which is pretty cool. I ordered the deluxe chicken and it was simply amazing. Fantastic service as well. I ordered and set my stuff down and within a couple minutes my food was brought out to me with a smile. Very polite staff, and delicious food.... what more could one ask for? I totally wish Chick-fil-A would sell thier Chick-fil-A sauce by the bottle cuz it's sooo good"}
{"text":"So after hearing a million compliments on Chik-fil-A and how they have THE BEST chicken EVER, I was pretty curious to check this place out. I was not disappointed one bit. The chicken was simply amazing, crispy yet moist at the same time, the waffle fries were amazing. Can we say new favorite fast food place? Yes, yes we can. I will definitely be back. The food was super fast, and they were super nice as well. This Chik-fil-A is located in the food court of Superstition Springs Mall. Great place to stop and get a bite to eat while doing shopping."}
{"text":"It is a Chick-fil-A on GCU! Good food awesome school and great service. Great place to grab a bite to eat before headed to class or a coffee to get you thru studying. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chickfila I've been too. The fries are always hot and crisp. They always include my sauce I ask for, and they even go the extra mile to put in a mint and hand wipe in the bag! No other CFA I've been too does that. 
They are always very friendly and overall an efficient team to make the drive thru very fast!"}
{"text":"I'm always pleasantly surprised with the service and quality of food. The sand which I was served actually looked exactly like the one in the picture. The store is always clean and the napkin/sauce station is always stocked. I feel like I don't have to mention that the staff is always professional and pleasant. If you've been you probably know exactly what I'm talking about. It's probably just me, but everyone I order I ask about any sauces or toppings they might out on and I always forget that they are naturally made exactly the way I like it. I really should go more often. That's all."}
{"text":"We love chick-fil-a.  It would have to be horrible for us to give a negative review.  Great food.  Clean restaurant.  Friendly environment.  Only thing to say is that service and staff was a little on the slow slide.  Don't know if that was because of the southern hospitality or just because they are slow.  At any rate.  We love it.  May not be back to this specific one but for sure chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain very much and I understand sometimes you're order as in my case is not right. But I watched a couple of people while I was waiting before me and their orders were not right as was mine and I know I watched three people for sure after me also and the staff was very unapologetic making the customer come back to the counter to fix their orders for dining room people. This was my first visit to this location I'm from Florida in Tallahassee for those locations are excellent and strive to serve this one not so much"}
{"text":"This is the third time being here and I gave it 3 chances and I won't be back again. Every time I place my order they get it wrong. The chicken is good which is why I gave it two starts, but that's really all that's good here. I always end up having heartburn and a watery stool when I'm done eating here."}
{"text":"Situated on one of the scariest roads in Charlotte, this chick-fil-a is a go getter!  The food is always fast and fresh!  The service is friendly and they know how to manage long lines during busy hours.  I could defiantly deal without all the chatter at the drive thru window.  Most of the time, there are a bunch of people at the window joking around and laughing and telling jokes to each other.  It is hard to make the customer feel like you have their undivided attention when you aren't even listening to the customer!  All I'm saying is, enough chit chat at the drive thru, and more attention on the people paying for the food that keeps you in a job!!  

Aside from that, the place is very clean inside and out.  It is easy to navigate the parking lot and easy to get in and out from the road.  

Good job, but less chatter please."}
{"text":"OLD REVIEW: Sorry, but chik fil a is garbage food. Stop selling people crap filled with preservatives and chemicals. Clean up your ingredients and maybe some folks can you seriously.

Then someone force fed me a breakfast sandwich and hashbrowns OMG! its damn horribly tasty BUT You need to cut out the garbage ingredients or i cant go back. how the heck do chicken nugeets have MSG and artificial anything. FIX THAT!"}
{"text":"Their salads are amazing! It's always clean inside the restaurant. Everyone there is super friendly. The kids play place is always clean too. Way cleaner than McDonald's."}
{"text":"Today is my meatless day and I eat vegetarian  only every other day. Decided to go to Chick-fil-a.  They really don't have any vegetarian options. Asked for a meatless breakfast burrito. Unfortunately they can do it but the price stays the same. The system is not setup to lower the price. That was disappointing.  I almost left but a women that was in charge named Maureen she is the marketing director helped me out. She understood what I wanted and made it work. I received my meatless burrito at the price it should be. Very happy will return. Thank you Maureen"}
{"text":"I was there today and if I could give you triple zero I would. You have the worst customer service! I have been a customer for years and today I decided to never ever go back again. I occasionally like to eat food without meat so should be able to get that at your store. I went to the Chick-fil-A  in Mesa on Stapley Drive a few weeks ago and they were awesome! I simply asked for a vegetarian option and the General Manager there made me a meatless burrito and did not charge me for meat that I didn't have! It was perfect.  So I kept that receipt and took it to your store. So instead of your so called manager named Makenzie using her managerial power that she is getting paid to do. She takes the receipt and goes to the back and I'm assuming asks one of the other managers Olivia,  and or Mike could she do it. She comes back and says well I can't make that it's against our policy. So just taking away the meat is against your policy? She did say she could make me a burrito and not add the meat but still charge me regular price. What sense does that make? I'm sure if they wanted to do it they could have. But they chose not to so it. So you have lost a long time customer as well as my family and friends. You need to learn from the folks over at the Stapley location. The reason you all have jobs is because of me the customer! So remember that from now on! Do not eat here go to Stapley!!"}
{"text":"Waffle fries are always good. Chicken always fresh and tasty. Can't go wrong with their lemonade either. One of the best fast food options around!"}
{"text":"Ahhh! I'm addicted to Chick-Fil-A!!!

I finally tried this place after hearing so many good things and I'm hooked. The first week I tried it.. I think I had it 4 times. haha. (Kinda embarrassing to say :X) 

I usually get the spicy chicken sandwich with all the fixin's and eat it with chick fil a sauce and buffalo. mmmmmm. The chicken is a huge piece and it's fried perfect! (Actually one time, it was way overdone. I let them know and they immediately cooked me a fresh one. I hope it didn't have spit in it, although they are so friendly and nice I doubt they would do something like that... or would they?)

The crisscut fries are soooo good. You can tell the oil they fry it in is fresh. They give you great service, it's clean and nice, they give you great extras, and they have community family events. Just feels like a wholesome place to be. :)"}
{"text":"New locations popping up in Las Vegas, NICE JOB on Eastern close to St Rose Pkwy and I see one on Sahara & i 15 ready to open. Would love to work for this company, it seems as if they treat their people good!! kind of a lost art in America the past several years GOOD luck. I will be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Went above and beyond even for a Chick-fil-A. What fast food restaurant can you go to at 9 at night and get perfectly fresh food? This Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"This is a review for the stand-alone restaurant on Mentor Ave. This is the only fast-food place where I never have any issues. The staff are polite, they always get my order correct and everything is always hot and fresh. My favorites are the fried chicken sandwich with extra pickles, waffle fries and a half lemonade/half unsweetened iced tea. Recently discovered their vanilla milkshake and frozen lemonade and am impressed with those as well. Last summer they had a delicious watermelon mint lemonade that was amazing, hope that returns. 

I used to go to the one in the Great Lakes mall as a kid and never thought it was that special, it's only after I moved away and didn't have it for 10-15 years and then rediscovered it years later that I realized it's one of the best fast-food choices out there. Chick-fil-A consistently has good food and friendly/efficient service that I rarely find at other places. Their chicken is always so plump, juicy and...moist, yes, I said moist. It's moist and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally Las Vegas has chicken! Lol
First time at this location and the line moved fast! For as crazy as their two lines where I give them credit. 
I checked my bag before driving away and I did have the wrong order but it was no big deal. They are doing a great job getting people in and out. Will be back many times over."}
{"text":"What is Chick-fil-A without Chick-fil-A sauce? Realized they forgot to put it in my bag when I got all the way home. Not only the Chick-fil-A sauce but the other two sauces I asked for for the other two meals I bought."}
{"text":"Wish hey had more parking. I wanted to go in and sit down with my little boy and have a nice lunch. No parking to be found. Ended up going through the drive thru and eating in our car. :-("}
{"text":"Never tired Chil fl a but it was ok. Wished I had not gotten the spicy sandwich but it was till good. Love their TV commercials and billboards so I had to give them a try"}
{"text":"Thank you for hosting such a beautiful event for daddy daughter date night! My little girl and her daddy had the most amazing time. She loved meeting Cinderella, going on the carriage ride, and the photo of daddy and daughter is proudly displayed on the refrigerator. They will definitely be back again next year! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Now i gave chik fil a FIVE STARS...this is what it deserves!!! Come on people REALLY???!!! Only 4??!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Chick-fil-A's all across the country and I absolutely love it! 
All of the staff is the highest quality out of any place I've ever been! The food is great, and is pretty well-priced. The prices have gone up over the years, but not enough to truly deter people, I don't believe. The kid area was fun for me years ago, and I know it still holds the same value today. They easily have the best sweet tea out of any place I have ever been to, and am proud to say that I will never stop going to Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is one of the few fast food chains I will eat. Especially now that they have made some changes to their ingredients and removed some of the chemicals from their food. So when I'm on the road I always seek them out. Anyways, this is a very clean location with good customer service. I usually get a kid's meal with side salad but this time I tried their new Market Salad....hands down best fast food salad I've ever had! Actually one of my new salad favorites outside of one I've made in my own kitchen. Well played Chick-fil-a, well played."}
{"text":"Great customer service. One of my favorite fast food restaurant. They never disappoint but this location is very busy so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Always pleasant to eat here the food is delicious. Especially the spicy chicken deluxe sandwich. The staff is always very helpful & courteous. Glad to have this place in Ahwatukee. Very rare to find these qualities in other places. That for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone loves this place. I think the food is average at best. Your typical fast food joint. Flies on the window, crumbs on the table from the last guest and the sick teenager running the cash register.  I had unpleasant gastrointestinal feelings after I got home. I don't see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Food is ok... I think its a bit overpriced though.. Service is good.. Just not a big fan.."}
{"text":"K & C wanted the Peppermint Shake again before they get rid of it until next holiday season. It was late again and this is the only Chick Fil A that we know of that is open late on Saturday nights. Our cashier was Elijah. He took our order at the drive thru and when we pulled up to the window he clarified our order and the changes (less choc chips and peppermint chips). Our shakes were perfect, again. Thanks.

Stays open late (11:59 on Saturdays). Nice Staff. Fair Prices. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"I really like Chick-fil-A. The chicken is really tasty. Tonight C got the 3 piece chicken strip meal. 3 good sized chicken tenders with criss cut fries & a med drink. C gave me his drink and opted for a frosted lemonade and I ordered him a medium fruit cup also.
The chicken strips were really good. They were not overly breaded & were hot. Winner winner chicken strip dinner. The fruit cup had a nice selection of red grapes, apple chunks, blueberries, mandarin oranges & strawberries. We get it every time we come here. The fries were disappointing. They were not crispy, not very hot & not really cooked enough. Yuk. Again, when C doesn't eat most or all of his fries, something is wrong. The frosted lemonade is more like a lemonade shake. C loved it of course but I would consider it a dessert & not a drink.
Awesome strips & fruit cup. Crappy fries. 3 1/2 Stars."}
{"text":"Katrina welcomed me as I came in the door. I've always felt the employees at this location are really a great group of people. Cheerful, helpful with good attitudes. Kudos to Don and his team.
I had an hour before a meeting so I stopped in for a Breakfast Burrito ($2.65). I opted for the Chicken variety. The burrito was filled with scrambled eggs, chunks of chicken, diced onions and peppers. This is a decent breakfast burrito for sure. I sat at a high top near the cashiers and got the opportunity to listen to a lot of the interactions between the staff and the customers and the staff among themselves. It was definitely a pleasant environment.
Clean dining room. Good Breakfast Burrito. Great Staff. Prices... ehh. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fast food person but since I wanted to secure parking in one of the malls during the worst weekend of the year I settled for this place. It has been a long time since I have eaten at Chick-fil-A. It is a chain some of which have their own venues.

For lunch I decided to get the grilled chicken combo. It comes with lettuce and tomato which may be a step up from the sandwich where they would just put a couple of pickle chips inside. Instead of French fries I opted for a kale salad. I was disappointed to learn that they no longer offer coleslaw nor their famous carrot and raisin salad. They still sell their chicken noodle soup. You can order just a sandwich or get a combo meal but your drink is no longer included.

The sandwich was nothing out of the ordinary. I did enjoy the kale salad because they had cut up broccoli in it. It's rare getting a meal for under $10.00 but that's what fast food is for.

Don't expect the greatest here. It's sad that they took that carrot and raisin salad off the menu. I used to enjoy it. Also be aware of the fact that this chain is always closed on Suns. It has been that way every since I discovered it in the once thriving Century III mall. The food court area is clean and well organized. There aren't too many offerings anymore at the mall of Robinson."}
{"text":"once again a....ma....zing!!!!!! Can't eat at a better Chick-fil-A. I come at least once-a-week and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flyer here , love the food. However, CUSTOMER SERVICE ? Drive through SUCKS! The sauce is the main component for the chicken. We specifically ask for what we want, explain they usually forget some, they said they \"red flagged our order\" so they shouldn't mess up, and what do they do? Mess up! So frustrating, so we ask for more at the window & they have a problem giving it there too, today was the icing on the cake, not only did they deprive me of my favorite sauce , but forgot my sons fries & there was a hair in mine. So disappointing, Chick-fil-A is supposed to be a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Tonight must have been a bad night. No service with a smile. No offer of Sauces. I love the food though! I wish we could have an Adults Only Day/ Night . Great Family place. Of Course I I will recommend it to one & all! The food is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Chick fil a for over a year now. I have always received great service and the food is always hot and fresh! Me and my friend just rolled through the drive through 2
minutes before closing and they made fresh fries and the gentleman who was helping us at the window had the courtesy to lean out the window and have a nice conversation with us while we waited. It's hard to get decent service anywhere anymore. For a fast food chain this one tops them all."}
{"text":"I pull in to drive through at 10:29.  Manager takes my order at 10:30.  No more breakfast despite the sign that reads \"breakfast served until 10:30\".  She tells me that means \"the beginning of the minute 10:30\".  Now stuck eating lunch at 10:30.  Poor management."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service at Chick-fil-A is just absolutely phenomenal. After ordering at the cash register, I was given an upside down cone that had a picture instead of a number with the sauces I picked inside and I suppose this was my \"ticket\" for the server to know where to bring my food. 

I ordered some chicken tenders and some waffle fries on the side with a lemonade tea. Although the tenders were small in size, it was crispy and quite delicious dipped in BBQ sauce. I wasn't a complete fan of the lemonade tea drink but still managed to drink most of it down. Overall, a good meal indeed."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling this chick-Fil-a! Honestly didn't get the best customer service as you always do at any chick-Fil-a. I Would say they dropped the ball on the day I went in to grab a quick bite to eat. If I go back and they change my mind completely I would say this review is a rough draft, but until then I think the 3 stars is just about right !"}
{"text":"Twice I've been to this place in the past few weeks and they're under-cooking the **** out of the chicken. This last time, they under-cooked both the spicy chicken sandwich and the nuggets. The ladies that work there are stiff and unfriendly (one that takes order on a tablet-phone, and the other that takes payment). I honestly think they don't give a **** any more, at least at this location."}
{"text":"I love this location, the line can be long but the food is always fresh, staff is nice, and my order is typically always correct!"}
{"text":"We went at 6pm. The food was good but experience was not impressive. Very slow and backed up. They seemed understaffed. The same guy that took our order got our drinks and made our iced coffee. I had to tell him twice I only wanted the entrees, not the meals so he had to re-ring the order. Only one girl was working the entire dining room so all the trash cans were full because she was delivering food and what not for everyone. We travel through here frequently and will not stop here again."}
{"text":"Dine in for the first time and it was very clean and pleasant. It's like the Stepford wife of McDonald's. The food was great but the saying \"my pleasure\" gets creepy after a while."}
{"text":"I never was a huge chick-fil-a fan until the hubby made me try it during our trip in California.
I am the biggest fan of waffle cut fries and their chick-fil-a sauce.
I usually order the spicy chicken sandwich I and he loves their original chicken sandwich.
Everything here is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love chick fil a.  There staff have to be one of the best trained employees at any fast food restaurant. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich meal. It is always great. I get the chick fil a sauce and it is so good. I enjoy eating here often."}
{"text":"My first job was in chick-fil-a many moons ago. I love the food and the excellent service provided by this fast food chain. This location off the Vegas strip is no exception. 
I ate here on a Wednesday night for a short break in the middle of a long drive. The food is typical Chick-fil-A quality and the service is the same. The reason for the 4 star rating here is the fact they they do not have trays if you are dining in. Food is given in a bag and your basically eating off the table with napkins. Overall I am satisfied."}
{"text":"Honestly, best, friendliest, fastest Chick Fil-a in Arizona. I've been to practically all of them and this one has constantly been quick in drive thru even with a long line.  Workers are always friendly and making me smile. And apologetic when they mera up and they more then make it up to you when they've made a mistake. There is a reason i prefer coming to this location above all others. Keep up the spectacular service!!!"}
{"text":"The way they have their drive thru set up is a joke. You wait in line for 10 min then they say your order isn't ready and to pull off to the side (cvs parking lot)and wait an extra 5 min for your order. It's happened on too many occasions. I don't mind waiting, but i do mind seeing the next 6 orders who ordered behind me in the same drive thru get their order before me. I only ordered 2 sandwiches as well, nothing else, nothing complicated."}
{"text":"This is the best quality fried chicken I have ever had. They also have amazing lemonade. The food is really, really good. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend you do so."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't go to fast food restaurants. Like, at all. This is purely the effect of my current San Francisco metropolitan lifestyle, as cliche as that may be.

However, a few coworkers insisted that I at least try this fine establishment. So to cross an item off my fast-food bucket list, I caved. (Still haven't been to Wendy's and Jack-in-the-Box, fingers crossed...).

The food was exactly as you'd expect, a giant menu of chicken--fried and grilled and every way you can imagine. That is a positive thing though, because I'm usually underwhelmed by the quality of fast food when compared to their own pictures on the menu.

Brownie points for the great service (I'm told they have to say \"my pleasure\" when thanked for their service) and the fact that they use all-breast meat and peanut oil to make their nuggety deliciousness.

Chick-Fil-A might just be one of the few fast food restaurants that deserve a 4+ rating.

-----

Distinguishing factor: A genuine fast food joint that is truer to their image than their counterparts."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Raintree shopping center! Excellent service-- smiling and happy people. When you eat in, they take your trays and ask you if you need a refill. Fast drive thru-- awesome market salad!"}
{"text":"I order breakfast pay an arm and a leg for it and they give me these cute little boxes that say to dip or not to dip... except they didn't give me any ketchup or anything to dip in. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A are all about the same. Kids love it. But the service during prime times is sub par!  Slow and unorganized.  They need to address this situation at this location."}
{"text":"Drive thru runs at 8:15 pm shouldn't take this long. Guess everyone had the same idea. 

Drive-thru attendant was pleasant and gave us the Chick-fil-a \"my pleasures\". Order was correct and good was hot. 

The thing that gives this visit a 4 instead of a 3 was the greeting by the manager on duty. He's always super friendly and almost falls out of the window to shake your hand!"}
{"text":"Who cares what the CEO thinks , this place has great chicken sandwiches that's what matters and they seem to be a family company . Remember Eat more chicken"}
{"text":"We have come here at least twice a week since they opened and everyone is as nice as any other Chick-fil-A and everything is consistent"}
{"text":"Like many other chick-fil-A fans, I was thrilled to see this location open in Henderson, NV. In fact, I think it was the first chick-fil-A to open in the state.

First, about the drive-thru: yes, there's a long, long line, so you're much better off parking the car and ordering takeout from inside. I walked in, ordered food, and had a bag in my hand 10 seconds after paying. All within 3 minutes of walking through the front door. And there's plenty of parking nearby, including loads of 60-minute parking spots on the perimeter, so spare yourself the wait in the drive-thru line.

My favorite item is the grilled chicken sandwich, juicy and tender, with Romaine lettuce (NOT iceberg!), tomato, and that inimitable sauce. Great stuff and healthy too. Note: this item is NOT breaded.

I'm taking off one star for a couple of reasons: 1) the menu is not as extensive as in San Diego, 2) they don't offer a free drink or discount for seniors, as they do in other states. On the other hand, prices are lower than in San Diego...maybe because the minimum wage there is $11.50/hr!

Service is cheerful and fast. The place was full even at 2:30 PM on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst location I've ever been too. I live nearby so I've given it about three separate chances and I just had to stop visiting this location. They are just so inconsistent that I just can't. 

For some reason, the chicken nuggets here are typically overdone more times that not. I'm not sure if I always come in between rush period and they sit out took long, but man they are pretty bad compared to other locations. I literally ALWAYS have to check my bag for something. One time they forgot the fries, one time the sauces I requested, on one occasion a cookie, etc. On one occasion I came here for lunch. I didn't check my bag upon leaving the drive thru and soon noticed my fries were missing. I call the store immediately and ask if they don't mind me coming back later to get them around 5:15pm when I'm off. Let's be real, I was hangry. The manager tells me that he can do that for me and would make note of it. I go back order the same thing I had for lunch and explain the situation and everyone is looking at me like I'm crazy. I show them the call log that showed I was talking to someone at the store for approximately two minutes and they just continue to look at me like I'm crazy. How am I crazy for wanting what I paid for?

It's pretty bad when I'd rather grab McDonalds instead of come here."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on a bad night? Drive thru was pretty quick and I received friendly service. I ordered a meal and a milkshake and was told I would need to pull up a little to wait on my milkshake. I begin to munch on my fries and they were lukewarm. The milk shake was taking long so I begin eating my room temp nuggets. I'm not the type of person to send back food if I don't find if hot enough so I suck it up and eat it and wait for my shake. About 7minutes later I send the boyfriend in to get my milkshake and they told him that they thought we drove off so it was just sitting there and they didn't even remake it. Of course it was milky and melted. I've given up on most fast food places in the University Area because of awful service and quality and it looks Chick Fil A will be added to the list."}
{"text":"Probably one of the quickest and cleanest Chick fil A I've ever been to. 

I dined in with my coworker and noticed how the cars in the drive thru were moving very quickly and how clean the lobby was kept. The meal was delicious like at every Chick fil A but the service is really what made this particular one stand out. They were even giving samples of the frosted lemonade."}
{"text":"Gave this place 3 chances, and it Failed! First time ever here I ordered the chicken nuggets, waffle fries & ice cream cone for desert, bland, everything was bland lol! The nuggets have No flavor, those \"famous\" waffle fries are even more bland & the ice cream is from a machine and I'd hate to say this but Mcdonald's swirl is wayyyy better lol. Second time around I went with something healthier. I ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich, bland again. Third time I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, bland, even the bread is just ok. I'm sorry but this place is  totally bland, I'll just say this, white castle and McDonalds are better, yeah, sad but true! I think this place is busy bc of the hype etc, but food wise, you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I was doing the no carb thing for awhile and my very first carb loaded meal was at Chik-Fil-A.  One would think that after not eating carbs for a couple months, anything would taste divine---- WRONG.

Chi-Fil-A used to be in malls when I was younger and they would hand out free samples of the yummy fried deliciousness on little toothpicks when you walked by.  This then would make me turn to my mother and beg, plead, cry to eat at Chik-Fil-A.  It was really good then.  This was my memory when I went to the Tatum location.  What I got was a super fried chicken fillet that needed salt-- gasp!  Who actually adds salt to fried chicken?  Well, this one tasted bland., so I HAD to.  My bun was soggy and my fries were cold.  Is this really the carbs I was craving all this time? No.  I should have gone to have sushi.

the 2 stars are because I WANT it to be more that 1 star. 

I give it another go ahead, a few weeks later-- at this point I have eaten so many carbs my pant buttons are popping off and AGAIN!  cold fries and soggy bun.  WTF??!!  I haven't been back since and since I am on a NEW diet, I won't be heading there anytime soon.  Boooooooo."}
{"text":"They consistently mess up the order. I repeatedly asked them in the drive through if all my order was in there and they said yes. Yet they missed out on 2 meals. When you are in a rush, make sure you check the order. I have complained to the manager but no use."}
{"text":"Food was great, but wow extremely rude employees. I'm a server and many of my tips are in ones, so naturally I paid with all ones, considering thats all i get, and the girl (a young blonde) seemed extremely irritated with the fact. The window at the drive threw is quite large and i heard her manager and another employee complaining about me paying in all ones saying it's annoying. After she gave me my change she literally just turned away from me and said nothing when she gave me my food. Very rude and not what i expect from a chick fil a.. wont be returning."}
{"text":"They were very crowded at lunchtime, but impressively efficient and attentive. The drive-thru, parking lot, and dining room were packed, yet there was almost no wait, and the food is great. They are the shining example all other fast-food-type restaurants should try to follow. Well Done!"}
{"text":"I usually love the waffle fries. Tonight they were soggy and tasted like pure oil.. :(
At least the drink was good."}
{"text":"To me, this is definitely the worst location I have ever experienced. Very slow service, and the attitude of their employees isn't ... well ... my pleasure\" quality. Ownership and management must be aware. This is a premier organization that usually does not tolerate such a low level of service."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I love chic fila.  Today I went to get an egg white chicken grill.  I waited in line for the drive thru for about 12 minutes.  I paid and was told to pull out front and wait for it to be brought out.  After about 10 minutes I went inside and didn't get my food for another 10-12 minutes.  I had to go find the manager and finally got my food and it had the smallest piece of chicken on it.  See the pic I left.  That was pretty disappointing after waiting over 25 minutes and being late to work!"}
{"text":"Drove past here today and remembered hearing someone last week say, \"I think Chick-fil-a has better nuggets than McD's\", because ya know, my brain retains useless information like that. So, against my better judgement, I stopped through the drive-thru knowing full well my last (and only) visit was depressing, but I try to believe in second chances. The only positive I can say this time is, I had very fast service. Because, shocker, there we no customers..

Nuggets: Horrible, while biting into a piece of gristle (nasty).
Fries: Bland and tasteless, just like last time.
Dr Pepper: Flat and no carbonation, just like last time.
Customer Service: Non-existent enthusiasm from anyone, just like last time.

I've learned today that I have nothing in common with anybody who enjoys the food or atmosphere here. 

Never again."}
{"text":"It is Chick-Fil-A, do I need to say more?   Fresh, tasty, and just damn delicious.  Clean place but crazy busy and a bit of an insane asylum.  

The chicken sandwich is legendary and such a simple product.    Perfect texture bum, two pickles, a smear of mayo and a perfectly fried chicken breast.  The waffle fries are uniquely delicious and always hit the spot.  

Just remember not to head there on Sunday."}
{"text":"It is Chick-fil-A, what else needs to be said?

Amazingly simple chicken sandwich. 
Crispy waffle fries. 
Crazy long lines at the drive thru. 
Very lively and efficient service inside. 
Super clean dining area. 
Tasty chocolate chip cookies. 
The best peach milkshake in summer months.  

Just go!  You know you want it."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a is a low-down dirty pusher, and waffle fries are the vice it peddles. I came around this evening (drive-thru) to try out the new location and get my fix, and I got stiffed. Bad. My large waffle fry had 5 fries in it, not nearly enough to serve as a vessel for the required amount of that sweet sweet chick-fil-a sauce.  On top of that, I got a side salad with no fork, like I'm some kind of hand-salad type savage. I think you're no good for me, CFA. I think I'm ready to go straight."}
{"text":"This location is the best. Everyone is so nice and even if there's a line they get you through the drive-thru line quickly. They always get my order right and the food is always the best."}
{"text":"After over 2 years since my last visit I decided to give this place another try. I am happy to say that this visit was much better. We tried the chicken tenders, nuggets and spicy chicken sandwich meal. To drink I had the frosted lemonade which was amazing. I will definitely return just for that. I really liked that the tenders and nuggets were obviously made from chicken and not some funky looking compressed meat and they were flavorful. I had the honey mustard dipping sauce which was also good. The only reason I didn't give 4 stars is because the cross cut fries were very under cooked. All in all much better experience than my last visit."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite fast food restaurant since I was a kid. Watch out Cane's, you have some major competition in Vegas now! We came on a Monday at 11am and the drive through line was fairly busy. We chose to go inside and the drive through line was gone by the time we parked and walked inside, Lol. When we got inside the line was 20 deep, but they took our order on a tablet and we were able to pay in minutes. I was amazed by the level of service and the level of organization. Extremely professional and efficient! Hollee took our order and did an awesome job! They did not have nearly enough seating for the business volume, but we were in-and-out in 5 minutes! Finally no more trips to Cali or Utah for Chick-Fil-A! Kudos to this location for hiring senior members of our community!"}
{"text":"Well I am now officially a fan of Chick-fil-A! We went on our lunch break and when we walked up to the door we were greeted with a smile. We ordered and the food was out immediately we weren't even done paying yet! What! I had my work badge on so the cashier took the initiative to get my name! We sat down the eating area was so clean and nice. It felt really welcoming!! I ordered the chicken club sandwich! It was delicious! And the Chick-fil-A sauce with the waffle fries were LIFE! We will be coming back for sure. I now understand the hype! You don't feel guilty for eating out at Chick-fil-A it felt like home cooking. I'm extremely satisfied going back to work. Lol. Thanks for the hospitality Chick-fil-A on Stephanie."}
{"text":"I've been into this location a couple times. Staff is super friendly and they come right out to your car to take your order. But on this last visit, I splurged a bit and ordered some of their waffle fries. Boy was I disappointed. Someone clearly lifted the basket from the fryer wayyyy too early. Rather than crispy fried potatoes, I got a ball of cold mushy potatoes shoved into a paper wrapper. Won't be ordering those again. I may be back for a periodic chicken sandwich though."}
{"text":"Well, to be quite honest I just came here because I wanted to do a review since it's the 1st one in Vegas.  I didn't even eat anything, she did.

Coming off the street, all you see are guys in neon green vests directing traffic to the drive thru. It's so packed! They can take your order from the drive thru areaas well. I wonder how long it's going to be like this. But anyway, we went inside to order because we're not lazy asses! LoL

I actually didn't even order food, she did. sShe got a chicken sandwich meal with waffle fries and lemonade. I spent about $8 bucks. Not too shabby. Next time I'll order too and eat their food. I'm sure I will come back soon."}
{"text":"So, I am not a huge fast food person, however, I grew up with Chic-fil-A and when I have that fast food craving, this is my spot. So, after a few visits, this location is spot on.  Although it is located in Uptown Charlotte and busy ALL the time, they run things so smoothly.  Recently I arrived around 12:30 and the line was long and I almost walked somewhere else, but had a Chic-fil-A craving!!! Literally I was in the line for less than 5 minutes. They have more than 5 people taking orders with mre than 2-3 runners delivering orders smoothly.
I ordered the 8 piece nugget meal, but really wanted more. Unfortunately my order was already in but they offered I order a separate order for 4 nuggets, not something I thought you could do. I received my drink and stepped to the side to get my ketchup and napkins and my name was called, quick service!
As for the food, everything is fresh and delicious. As I mentioned I ordered the nuggets, so good, but the classic chicken sandwich is another great alternative.  I also love the Chic-fil-A sauce and always ask for extra pickles.
A definite treat and never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This location is always packed, especially the drive thru.  With that said, it is one of my favorite locations, food is always on point and the service is amazing!

One thing I am still disappointed about, and it has nothing to do about this location, but why did Chic-fil-A change the sauces and get rid of the cole slaw?? Still miss it.

Anyway, if you're in the area, definitely make a stop here."}
{"text":"Some days you are just craving Chick-Fil-A, and as Jenny B. said, most of the time I do is on Sundays, when they are closed.  Luckily for me, I had a craving this week and didn't ignore it.  This location is the closest to me and every time I have been the service is friendly and the food is always great.
Although I have tried a variety of items I am an 8 piece chicken nugget meal gal!  This most recent visit the nuggets were fresh and warm, the fries cooked to perfection.  I always ask for a side of pickles, because that is something I miss from the chicken sandwich.  So, yes, this may sound strange, but I put a pickle on the nugget and dip in the barbeque sauce, heaven.
Another treat, their Cole Slaw. Add a side of cole slaw to your next meal, you will not be disappointed. A side order is actually pretty large that I always have left-overs, which I love.

Overall, I know why the drive thru is always packed, and the lines at the Chick-fil-A food courts are always the busiest. Chick-fil-A doesn't disappoint and the food can meet the needs for all, offering grilled chicken, fried chicken, soups, salads, desserts and more.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Once again this proves to be the WORST Chick-Fil-A in the chain! Today I stopped in for just two unsweetened ice teas. When I got to where I was going--5 minutes later--I discovered that both drinks had no ice! When I returned a few hours later to buy two more and told the manager my story, I was offered no apology and had to pay for the drinks. She insisted that they are NEVER served without ice!"}
{"text":"Some of the highest-quality fast food you will ever have.  This place is always crowded, but they handle it well and still get the food out quick.  I wish there was one closer to my house because this one is so far away.  It is still worth the drive though."}
{"text":"Five stars for being the fastest fast food place I have ever been to.  I get my food within 30 seconds of paying every time.  Food wise its a chick fil a, so not great.  Bit if I need a fast unhealthy lunch its great to have a place I can get in and out of in 2 minutes with my food."}
{"text":"Fast and friendliest service. Lisa is the best. She is so kind and helpful and genuine. What a gem. Keep her and give her a raise. The food is great but she's what my daughter Zoe loves best :)"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and I'm happy to report that the waits were not as horrendous as I'd expected.  Rancho and Sahara is one of the busiest intersections in town and building the first Vegas location of Chick-Fil-A here didn't sound like the best of ideas.  However, we've been able to find parking easily on both visits, once at night and today around 10:30am.  The best thing to do if you want to beat the line is use the CFA app and do a mobile order, which my boyfriend usually does.  Your food comes out quickly and then you can still grab a seat in or outside the restaurant.  We didn't use the app today since the line wasn't that long.  As with every other CFA location, this one has very friendly and attentive customer service.  The staff checks on you throughout your meal and you can get free drink refills from them so you never have to leave your table.  The chicken nuggets are my favorite and make a great little snack.  Having this location here actually makes it convenient to EAT MOR CHIKIN since it is so close to the 15 freeway.  When we need our Chick fix, we'll be here."}
{"text":"The wait for Chick-Fil-A is over, kinda.
If you come to this location, one of two now open in Henderson, you're in for a wait, depending on when you arrive.
I first attempted to come here last night around 6:15pm (Wednesday) and there was a maze of Henderson Police directing traffic, customers parking and walking into the restaurant, and lines for the drive-thru that weaved around the parking lot.  It doesn't help that there's currently construction going on in the parking lot that's probably one culprit for all this chaos as there are sections that are totally blocked off.  The other reason it's super busy is that there are tons of people wanting to EatMoreChikin. I managed to park, but the line was out the door if you were planning to dine-in, so I just went home.  
My second and successful attempt was today, arriving around 11:15am.  The line was not out the door this time, but just inside.  However, there were employees armed with mini-iPad-things taking orders so by the time you got to the register you just had to pay.  The restaurant was almost full, but there are tables outside, too, if you want to dine al fresco.  I had my food by 11:30am, so my recommendation is to come as early as possible since this place is going to be packed for a while or just come armed with a LOT of patience.  My usual order of the 8-count nugget meal was as terrific as always.  I've been a Chick-Fil-A fan since I grew up with it in Southern California.  The customer service here is just like the other locations:  attentive and friendly.  Fast food may not be your thing, and it's not usually mine, but there are a few exceptions for me including CFA and that burger place which hails from So Cal.  Food snobs need not apply.  Welcome to Southern Nevada, Chick-Fil-A!"}
{"text":"CFA is now in the same state where we reside--woohoo!
I know there are people who don't understand the long lines and the adoration, but that's alright.  We all have our favorite places to eat and, for me, Chick-Fil-A has a special place in my heart.  Growing up in Southern California, CFA was everywhere and it's easy to take it for granted until you move to a state that doesn't have one.  I just love the nuggets here because they're fresh and I can get a nice dose of protein at the same time.  Dip them into one or more of the sauces available and don't forget the waffle fries.  Customer service at any location we've visited has always been extremely friendly and this one is no exception.  You never have to leave your table for refills or throw away your trash because the staff is constantly walking around and checking on you.
We stopped by last night around 7:15pm (Thursday) and the lines for the drive-thru were long, but we were eating in.  Parking wasn't that difficult to find and the b/f used the mobile app to place our order.  This was much faster as the line was out the door for those who were placing their orders inside.  We got our food in about ten minutes and were seated eating our food while others were still in line.  Moral of this story:  use the app to save time and EatMoreChikin faster.  
Welcome to Henderson, CFA!"}
{"text":"This review can go for pretty much any Chick-Fila-A because all that I've visited are awesome, but this one I frequent the most. Customer service is the best, they set the example on how it should be done. Don't let a line at lunch or dinner time detour you, they usually get through the line fast and the food comes out super fast  after you order. They bring the food to the table which I love. Great food, i always get a chicken sandwich. Very clean and well maintained. Friendly staff. My favorite for sure in this industry!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why this restaurant is doing so well. Their chicken is dry the sandwiches are dry. Their sauces aren't that great. I'm just not impressed"}
{"text":"Eat more Chicken?!

My favorite saying lately!!

Absolutely love this location on Power Road. Clean, convenient, and has to be the friendliest location I  have been to in awhile.

Love the Chicken Strips!!

Fries are OK - Usually they are not cooked all the way to my liking - this is ALL locations!

There Cheesecake is so fresh and moist my mouth is watering now!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say I was greeted with open arms and love.  Great food, great service, and the most amazing staff at any fast food joint I have ever met."}
{"text":"So after a long awaited opening of this fast food chain they finally opened the 2 in Henderson.  I have visited twice now. The 1st time i had to wait quite a bit in the drive thru but I had a nice experience from the girl who was standing outside to take orders to the people I picked up my food and pay from.

The 2nd time however my husband and I went later at night and it wasn't to long a wait. Kinda funny tho how the girl on the intercom couldnt get my name right so switched to my husbands and took 2 times to get his right. My husband got the classic chicken sandwich and I wanted to try the chicken club that had cheese & bacon on it but when I got home I found I got just the regular grilled chicken sandwich. Also, unlike my 1st visit we werent offered any sauce choices.
 Luckily I remembered just before we pulled away. This is why I only gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Boo for Chick-fil-A closing the Ghettrocenter location, which was closer, but yea for this location for being so much closer than Arrowhead.

Come to think of it, this location was quicker and more efficient than Arrowhead, resulting in hotter, fresher food.  Yea for Deer Valley Chick-fil-A.
My lunch hour drive thru order was ready before I was with the cash, meaning the chicken's precooked, but they still had to slap it together, since I got the lettuce and tomato.  All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce, good-as-can-be-expected tomato (2 slices), and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum.

The two clerks I interacted with were friendly and it even seemed genuine.  Sure Chick-fil-A is not as cheap as other fast food choices, but it's so much better feeling the clear juice of a real chicken breast run down your hand than the mucky slippery oil from a chopped & formed chicken 'patty' that a lot of places have. (Exactly what part of the chicken is the 'patty', anyway?)

Churchies own all their places, so they are oh so annoyingly closed on Sundays as a rule.  But the food is so good that any effort to protest them by not going the rest of the week would be short-lived.  Now if they ever started in-store proselytizing, that'd be a different story, but they've never done that, far as I can tell.

When I go in, I get the Ice Dream; exactly what part of the cow that is, I do not know, but it's sad to think they get those cows' hopes up by making them stooges for their \"EAT MORE CHIKN\" mock-protest marketing campaign, only to steal their dreams from them one way or another, and freeze them up for a tasty frozen dessert.  I picture a dark and gloomy torture room, probably the basement of one of their churches, where cows are strapped up and sucked of their dreams,  like the hapless folk from the Dark Crystal having their 'essence' drained by the Skeksies.  Or maybe that's how they get the fresh lemonade?"}
{"text":"Never eat here!! Especially the location on Arizona Ave. and Ocotillo in Chandler Arizona. They don't respect coupons and their employees lie to you. The girl at the drive through told me she talked to the owner whose name is \"David Kralovich\" and said they would not respect my coupon. I called in and asked to speak to the owner and another girl (Ashley) informed me that the owner was not there. I am appalled that these employees can lie straight to their customers and they claim it is a \"pleasure to serve you\". I had to wait for 25 minutes in the drive through line and got NOTHING. Do not trust this incredulous company."}
{"text":"The best CFA in Arizona they never disappoint me. Its a lot better than that CFA on metro I used to work at (I was only there for 4 weeks since me and a bunch of workers got laid off. Place was getting on my nerves anyway) but the workers are so nice and friendly. Even when the place is packed they don't let the rush take away the friendly environment. The owner seems to care more for costumers than the company profits (unlike the metro owner). Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A for dinner tonight. Went through the drive in at Stephanie and Warm Springs. The Henderson police were there to direct us to the end of the line. It was a mob scene. We went thru drive thru. It took us 20 minutes to get through. Not bad at all. The line of people to get inside was wrapped around the building. It was moving very fast. They had people with Ipads out in the drive in area. They take your name and your order. Then you make your way around the building. You come up to a young lady who asks you if your are______. Then you pay her. Next step you come to the window where they verify your name again and deliver your hot food already to go. Finally, last stop is the condiment girl. She has a whole cart of condiments and gives you anything you want. Amazing operation. These people know how to do it. Not a complaint. No problems, order perfect.
The sandwiches were very good. Fresh, hot, tasty. Very good. Don't understand the big deal about the waffle fries. They were potatoes, and they were fried. Not much else to say. 
Great job Chick. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since Chick-Fil-A's Chicken Sandwich publicly squawked in opposition of Gay Marriage, I vowed to NEVER, EVER indulge in the delicious golden fried filets served between two warm buttery buns and topped with a pickle....

As my word is my bond, I have shifted my behavior to ordering either the chicken nuggets or the chicken tenders--both of which have bravely stepped forward to denounce the backwards, bigoted views of their sandwich cousin. 

These open minded chicken pieces offer a compelling delivery medium to satisfy your cravings for Chick-Fil-A's perfectly fried poultry.  Oh, and its worth noting that chick-fil-a's assortment of dipping sauces offer as much diversity as a San Francisco marriage court and represent all colors of the rainbow.  One can only assume that like the nuggets and tenders, these sauces are accepting of any and all same sex shenanigans and equality of tax and medical benefits.

In other news, has anyone ever noticed that the team members at Chick-Fil-A all have awesome attitudes? 

It's the little details that make a big difference and I actually believe a lot of these restaurants are helping the teeny boppers they employ improve their manners at the end of the day, be a little better at life.  Anytime you thank a staff member at one of their locations they say \"my pleasure\"--something emblematic of their service model and a refreshing change from the f-tards employed at your neighborhood burger king, mickey d's etc.  

Moral of the story: crank up some Elton John or Mackelmore \"Same Love\" and enjoy the various golden fried poultry parts of this ehem...right (chicken) wing favorite."}
{"text":"What is it about Chick-fil-A that's so good?  Seems like a simple concept.  Chicken.  But they have perfected it. The spicy chicken sandwich is probably one of the best around.  I love their service and the waffle fries go great with the Chick-Fil-A sauce.  I go here about once a month."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chick-fil-A.  We had good service at this one and everything tasted fine.  I love the spicy Chicken and fries with Chick-fil-A sauce."}
{"text":"Solid Chick-Fil-A at the PIT.   Food and service are of the quality you expect from this chain.   It's not as fast as the locations at the Atlanta airport but they don't have anywhere near the volume."}
{"text":"Nice store with great customer service.  They appear to truly aim to please and not worry about petty details...they serve to please it appears.  Always happy after visiting this location.  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I love Chick-Fil-A!!! I always get the chicken strip meal. There chicken strips are amazing and the Polynesian sauce is the best dipping sauce. 

This is the closest location to me which is a little sad because that means I have to go into the mall to get it. I can't just go to the mall just for food I have to be there to do some shopping. 

The staff has always been super nice every time I go."}
{"text":"People are super friendly. I believe it's a prerequisite of working with chick fil a.  

We moved here from the south and we are used to chick fil a's on every corner.  

They all are always busy so I was actually surprised when we arrived at lunch time it was moving pretty quickly with orders.  

Chick fil a has a secret menu we always have ordered from but the employee at this establishment either isn't aware of it, didn't ask or they just don't do it here in Vegas. 

The play area is clean but sort of small compared to others we have been at. On the other hand the facility is huge and plenty of seating. 

The employees clearly are making it a point to keep everything clean; this restaurant was
Super clean 

Over all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"It's a nice chick fil a, it's beginning to be run down considering its new.  Some seats are torn and the play area is filthy.  I think part of the problem with the play area is kids aren't taking shoes off. My sons hands and feet were filthy.  
Up at the front registers it is really dirty too. I did see them wipe tables and seats off but still it was dirty inside. 
The employees are super friendly like at all chick fil a's. 
Usually we are asked if we want refills and today no one asked and they weren't all that busy."}
{"text":"So happy they finally opened a chic filled a in Vegas! I've always gotten good service and Cynthia is so sweet. She takes care of you like you were at her home, is very helpful and makes you feel welcome. I love the milkshakes here which makes the drive worth it and the quality of the chicken tenders beat out any other fast food chicken. I wish they had a location on my side of town but the drive is worth it so far."}
{"text":"This Chick-fil-A is nothing but a disguise for people claiming to be Christian but living a totally different way. If, based on the majority of these managers, is what a Christian is, I will stay away from that kind of claim. And the owner, wow is that a joke. I am allowed to review and based on my limited experience all I can say is that if you want to pretend to be a Christian for a marketing ploy no one can stop you but if you do this it only leads to branding of what people think of Christians in general. SHAME ON YOU FOR MAKING SUCH A LIE OF A CLAIM!"}
{"text":"I had never eaten at Chick-Fil-A before this location opened and now I am a serious fan. The plain old chicken sandwich has been reborn for me and i also love the nuggets. Mickey D's is going  to take a hit for sure. 

Save the Cows, Eat More Chicken"}
{"text":"Favorite fast food restaurant of all time.  The manners and customer service are impeccable, always a \"pleasure\".  Food is always amazing, and yes, it's more costly, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fast food guy. I haven't had fast food from anywhere in literally probably 10 years. My friends repeatedly insisted however that I give Chick-fil-A a try so I did. 

I just got some strips with Chick-fil-A sauce to give it a try, but I have to say I was impressed. The chicken wasn't too thickly breaded and the white meat was actually good. The sauce was flavorful; it slightly resembled a honey mustard, but was a bit more mild and more flavorful. The waffle fries were good too - thick potato fries. 

While I haven't eaten fast food in 10 years, I have stopped while traveling to use the restroom of several chains over the years. Normally it is a shoo-away-the-fly-hold-your-nose type experience. This bathroom was clean though, odor-free, bug-free, and even had a mouthwash dispenser in it! 

Overall though what struck me was how nice everyone was. When ready to take another order, instead of just standing there or yelling \"next\" the cashiers called out, \"I can serve the next guest.\" They smiled. They were familiar with the menu. The service was fast and shockingly the order came out correctly despite a long line inside and at the drive-thru. 

I won't say that I'll be back weekly, or monthly for that matter, but if faced with a need food fast decision, Chick-fil-A will be higher on the options list."}
{"text":"I literally just finished eating my meal and decided to rate this place. I'm giving them 2 stars because the food is just OK. Like it's not bad but it's also not good, so it's OK. I would have given them 3 stars if they did not forget to give me the 4pcs chicken strips I ordered. Still contemplating if I should go back to get it, I mean I did pay $5 for them but then again like I said it was just OK so might not be worth it. I feel like it will be a waste of my time. The only reason I went to order food here is because it's new in town and just wanna try it. I know they have opened one or two in town but I've never gone and I decided to check this one out because it's close to my house. It's definitely the first and it will also be the last time i'm going there. I'll stick to Raising Canes."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich.  Both the bun and the chicken were ice cold.  Bun was hard and dry.  Yesterdays sandwich?"}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with our overall experience here. I haven't been to chick-fil-a in maybe eight years. All I can say is wow. The side salad was the perfect size, the chicken was so juicy and tender. Jenifer the manager was so informative and amazingly sweet. I'm not at all exaggerating, I ordered and walked to my table and my food was already sitting with my family. The food beat me to the table.  The vibe of the restaurant was great, not that of a regular fast food place but more that of a community. We had two different conversations with two different tables. It was so nice. We will definitely become regulars."}
{"text":"The only reason I have two stars is because the food is good, and they offered me a coffee.
I placed a catering order on Friday afternoon, with a pick up for Monday at 8:30 am (for a 9:30am meeting). I arrived at 8:25am and spent five minutes trying to get someone to acknowledge me at the pick up area. Once I got the attention of a cashier, at 8:31am, he left to check on my order. When he returned, I was told it would be 10 minutes before they had it ready, \"since they had a lot of orders this morning\".
8:41am...no order...
8:51am...no order...
9:00am...order is ready, and they helped me take the trays to my car...
...plates are missing (the ones I ordered Friday), so back into the resturant for plates and napkins.
9:03am, on my way with my order."}
{"text":"Need a chicken fix?  I love the chicken club sandwich. My friend ordered the salad and could barely finish it--its loaded with healthy veg too

At one point the play area was invaded by some unsupervised 10-13 yr old rowdy boys but after I told an employee about it, it was quickly taken care of.    good lemonade and workers are happy to help you with refills or anything requests you may have :)"}
{"text":"We just moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas, I've heard a lot about chick fil a, decides to give it a try for the first time, it was great, i had the spicy chicken deluxe and kids meal chicken nuggets for my daughter, it was very good, will definitely give it a try again. Very friendly staff and clean."}
{"text":"Thank you guys tonight!!!  My daughter doesn't eat meat so she loves their wrap without chicken and I love their grilled chicken and the Cobb salad is so fresh and green  yum!! Get up to the window and I can't  find my wallet and these guys were so sympathetic and just said we got you don't worry just go home and enjoy your meal and we hope you find your wallet!! Thank you so much and I did find my wallet?

{"text":"Chick-Fil-A just does it right!

The consistency of service and food quality is amazing! You can close your eyes and dine at any Chick-Fil-A and you'll barley notice any difference. The food quality is a standard throughout their operations. 

It may not be fancy but the facilities are clean, the food is good, and the staff always greets customers with a smile!!"}
{"text":"I am not one who write about fast food chain normally.  But I feel the need to say this location is consistent with its service quality.  If I go there often enough, they would recognize me and say hi.  This location also has the lovely hand wipes, which is fabulous to have around if you just need a quick clean wipe before eating.  Several times recently I went during lunch hour and they had balloon people making balloon toys for kids.  I think that's great.  I even got a ladybug made for my co-worker to bring home to her little girl.  And last time the (rather creepy) cow was there, high-5-ing people and entertaining kids (or maybe scaring a few along the way).  

I do have to warn you, parking is difficult here.  Heck, going in and out of this place can be a task on its own during peak lunch time.  It's not uncommon to see Woodlawn traffic in a standstill because there's a line waiting to turn into Chick-Fil-A.  My suggestion is just go there little earlier or later and avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and great tasting chikn just like every other Chick-Fil-A I've been to.  Very friendly and polite staff.  Expect a long line and some wait around lunchtime.  The staff is really good at keeping up though."}
{"text":"This location is the gold standard for drive-thru at lunch time. I came in today and was a little worried when I saw the line wrapping the building. I didn't have a lot of time for lunch today. But it felt like I never touched my brakes....it is really a drive thru. There were about 3 or 4 employees standing outside with handheld devices. They walked up to my car, and literally walked along side my car as I idled forward toward the window and took my order, swiped my card, and I was done. I pulled to the window and they \"threw\" my bag in with everything inside, even the sauces I wanted. Done and complete in less than 5 min. Give the management a raise!"}
{"text":"I can eat like 1000 of these sandwiches. Great food, everyone knows that. 

This place does a lot of community events and has great employees. I had a complaint about the coffee and the owner called me and apologized. I appreciated it very much. 

Thanks for the fun and great food!"}
{"text":"The one on Camelback is so much better. The grilled nuggets taste better, the service is better, they actually give me the sauce I ask for...it's honestly gotten worse over the past few months. They almost always give me the wrong sauce but the last time I went I didn't get ONE of the correct sauces I asked for. I feel like they are just lazy teenagers who don't give a crap. I didn't realize the difference in the food until I recently went to the one on Camelback and the grilled nuggets tasted fresher. Take some notes from that location!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo I really don't waste my time commenting on fast food but this place is simply awesome their fries are like these lil tic tac tos of joy lol. They are super fast,kind and friendly. Went on a weekend just to try it out and had the best fast food experience"}
{"text":"If I could I would give negative stars. I know it's a very busy location and the staff tries to fulfill every order to the customers satisfaction, however I had unsalted, soggy waffle fries, the extras I had ordered and paid for were forgotten as well as my sauces :("}
{"text":"I think this location beats all other locations across the U.S. That I've been to. Right away I was greeted at least three times with smiling faces. Order taker was super nice and made sure we had our order right. Food was brought out to us, was asked how it was and even had a lady fill our drinks for us from out table.
Great job to whoever runs this location and trains"}
{"text":"The staff at this location is awesome.  The amount of effort they put out to be friendly is great.  If you have a small kid, eating in is awesome.  They keep the place clean - someone is always walking around and wiping down tables, getting you refills, it's very odd for a fast food chain.  The playhouse is where my kid spends his time!  You can sit and relax and watch for a bit while your kid plays.  Afterwards - exchange their toy for a small ice cream cone too!  

Yes it's not the cheapest fast food place, but I'm willing to pay more to get a smile from the person taking my order and a bathroom I can wash my kids hands in and not feel like I need hand sanitizer for him as well when we walk out!

Chicken is chicken - it's not healthier than McD's, but it's also tastier than their chicken.  Ice Cream here is pretty tasty - try the frozen coffee - it's coffee with Ice Cream mixed together and is really good!  

Their breakfast is actually really good - their Sausage, egg and cheese biscuit is crazy good - and loaded with all the natural cholesterol and fat you'll need for the entire day in one meal!  But if you want to eat healthy - get a salad!"}
{"text":"I am here at least twice a week. The staff here is wonderful and very pleasant to deal with. Alex and Jordan are two friendly staff who I see and speak to each and every time I come in. I enjoy spending my lunch here due to the quality of food and friendly staff. Keep up the great work!!!!"}
{"text":"I made the 30 mile drive across town to go to the Eastern location. When I got there the driveway was blocked. Their lot was packed so I parked at Lowes. I waited in the long line to place my order. I ordered 2 regular chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. I ate inside and waited 10 minutes to get my food. I didn't care because I figured it would be fresh. My first sandwich was warm. The second was ice cold AND no pickles were on it. The fries were a little above cold. 
The sandwich was ok. I thought it would be extra special because of all the hype. I watched the news and it showed that people were camping in the parking lot before they opened. WHY?
KFC makes a better sandwich and it is less than a mile away from me. They are also opened on Sunday. 
If your bored and have nothing else to do go ahead and stand in line for an ok sandwich. It is all hype. 
When all you do is chicken the food should be better."}
{"text":"This Chik-fil-A is my daily favorite for the great food and amazing, courteous employees! The chicken noodle soup is the best ever, truly no place compares! The salad choices are awesome; my favorite is the Southwest Chicken. Top the soup and salad off with the macaroni & cheese or fries, or if your really hungry, you must try the grilled chicken sandwich! Grab a lemonade as your beverage and your set! Download the app and earn treats for dining there! Do you think I go too much when I pull in the drive through and they know my nameThis awesome Chik-fil-A is my favorite! I'm on my way now! Get the app and you can order ahead for pick up...SWEET"}
{"text":"Best service at a fast food place ever. Just saw a young man open a ketchup packet for an elderly woman. I would give 100 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"It's usually not fair to review a business when they've first opened, but Chick fil A is absolutely killing it! Obviously, this has been much anticipated and it can be hard to live up to the hype, but they've really blown away expectations.

We went the 1st Saturday they were open and I really figured it would be a nightmare. So glad I was wrong! HPD was there directing traffic and assisting with crowd control and there was A LOT of staff to ease the wait.

The line wasn't that long - we waited about 10 minutes to get inside and were actually able to place our order from outside while we waited. The cashiers were quick and friendly and made it all very easy.

The wait for food was a bit longer, but it wasn't for lack of trying in the kitchen. I have never seen so many people working so hard to get food out. Overall, the experience was seamless and they did a fantastic job of managing the crowd.

The food was amazing and I can't wait to go back, even though this wasn't my first time!"}
{"text":"Love this location although I have 2 other and soon 3 near me!  They are always busy but extremely expedient, food is always hot and fresh and the staff are as friendly as they can be!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I'm one of the few people in the world that is not a die hard chick-fil-a fan. That being said my husband can eat here for every meal and if they served their chicken minis all day I might consider it. I did however want to give a complement when it's due. The hospitality manager Jeff made our experience great! His upbeat attitude and welcoming words will make us come again. I don't think a better employee is suited for this position then Jeff."}
{"text":"I adore Chick-fil-A as a whole. I appreciate their entire business model, BUT Gastonia's Chick-fil-A on Franklin Blvd. is horrible. If you are from West or South Gastonia or if you work in the Franklin Square area THIS is the Chick-fil-A that you are stuck with. I believe that is the ONLY reason this location gets so much business. Yes the lines are insane, but I could deal with the lines a little more happily if the food wasn't under par and if the staff was friendly. They should really take notes from the Denver location! They are always so kind and cordial! They make you feel important. Because let's face it, if I wanted people to be rude to me I would go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"First off, let me say I've been told by multiple people that Chick-fil-A doesn't like homosensuals and as you may already know, I am a card carrying member of the LGBTQ+ community and it doesn't really bother me. It probably should and most likely will after I do some soul searching but that breakfast though.

Anyway, ask me why I haven't reviewed this Chick-fil-A yet, go on, ask me. Actually, don't ask me because I don't know. And don't ask me why I've only checked in once when at one point I was coming here every morning for breakfast. Every morning! I couldn't live my life that way anymore so I stopped but it was great while it lasted. I'm not really a fan of their lunch/dinner food, I'll order a kid's meal with a fruit cup side and a chocolate milk if I must, but their breakfast is everything. I don't even get chicken, lol. Their hot coffee tastes like mud but their iced coffee can be fixed with a little more milk so I just usually alter it to my liking at work. I usually order two number 5's, one with sausage for my mister, and one with bacon for me. For a chicken place, their sausage is one of the heartiest and most \"meaty\" sausage's I've ever tasted. Idk why it tastes like it comes from a really ornery farm animal (Idk if it's beef or pork, I think pork?). I'm weird about eggs but I can eat Chick-fil-A eggs no problem, they taste fresh and like they're actual eggs, not artificial, which I'm sure they are. And I love their little hash browns, so good. They're like Burger King hash browns but better. Try them with the honey roasted BBQ sauce and you won't be sorry. Unless you're my husband who doesn't like that sauce, he's  sorry, but don't be like him."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a has the best business model in fast food, and the Ray Rd locale is no exception. How awesome is pulling up to a drive-thru with 3 cars ahead of you, and 3 minutes later the courteous/friendly employee at the window is handing over your hot/fresh food? Love it!"}
{"text":"Drive thru was Daytona fast! 

Friday, just before 1:00pm, dreading the inevitable wait in line, but hold on a minute--is that two order lanes at the drive-thru?? Yes!  Seven cars ahead of me? Ugggh. So much for 2-lane efficiency. I'll check-in on Yelp to bide my time. \"Who's honking at me?? Oh.\"  There is a two-car gap between me and the next car. Flash a guilty smile through the rear-view and a quick wave . . . no smile from that dude. \"Wonder what Yelp fans think of this locale. . . ?\" Another honk? A look to the rear view and then to my front. \"What the hell?\"  The girl in the drive thru window is literally leaning her head out the window, dangling my bag of chow in her hand as to say, \"Come on Big Guy, you can do it!\" I crap you negative, the drive thru took about 120 secs from green-to-checkered flag on a busy Friday at lunchtime. Impressive and appreciated!!!

Oh yeah . . . my chicken sammie and iced tea?? YUMMAY!!!!

I love Chick-fil-a . . . 

Cheers!
RS"}
{"text":"Food was as expected.

LOCATION SUCKS!!! Getting in and out is a serious pain! The time from entering the drive through line to receiving food was 19 minutes 42 seconds. Thats an everyday occurrence. If you come here, expect an extended wait. The staff were very helpful and friendly despite the fact that they were standing outside at 105 degrees."}
{"text":"I used to go by Chick-Fil-A every morning when I was in high school for a chicken biscuit, but I'm older and not as active and that would be crazy...delishious as hell but not smart and expensive.  So I keep it simple.  Like any other hard working American and I don't feel like cooking I look for faster choices.  Usually I order the plain combo and top it off with some BBQ Chick-Fil-A sauce, the Chicken Salad Sandwich (it's pretty good), or my favoirte the Chicken Strip Salad.  Anywone who has been with me when I have ordered this salad knows it takes me about 10 minutes to prepare the salad by evenly distributing the carrots, cheese, and broccoli around the salad.  Then I have to cut up the chicken strips put the sunflower seeds all over (not too many in one place) and lastly the croutons.  I use two different types of dressing.  Either a Honey Mustard or Ranch with Spicey. I put half of each packet on and then dive in (this way once I eat the first top layer I still have enough for the second).  I know this is a little OCD but it truly does make the salad simply delish!  If you read this then try it and tell me thank you for helping you discover how to make a good salad...perfect :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this particular Chick-fil-A twice. Both times, I have had positive experiences. The drive thru has two ordering kiosks. My order was promptly taken, the staff was very friendly, and the food tasted great. The location of this restaurant is very convenient when driving north on Arizona Ave."}
{"text":"If you like chicken this is a good place to have it.  Quick and efficient service and tasty fried and grilled chicken.  Shakes, lemonade and other food selections with a double drive through for even quicker service.  I still am partial to the Colonel but they do spicy chicken real fine here.  Prices are reasonable.  Skip the bun if you don't like gluten.  Like A T & T owned by a conservative but I am still a customer."}
{"text":"It's processed chicken.  It's average.  It has MSG, it's not too easy to get a soda refill (make sure you have the receipt) Gets poor reviews from human rights organizations, Not open Sunday.  Can't think of a reason to come back. Don't understand the hype. Staff friendly and cheerful (or this would be one star)

A little too processed for me:

Ingredients

chicken (whole breast filet, seasoning [salt, monosodium glutamate, sugar, spices, paprika], seasoned coater [enriched bleached wheat flour {with malted barley flour, niacin, iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid}, sugar, salt, monosodium glutamate, nonfat milk, leavening {baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate}, spice, soybean oil, color {paprika}], milk wash [water, nonfat milk, egg], peanut oil [fully refined peanut oil, with Dimethylpolysiloxane, an anti-foam agent added]), bun (bleached, enriched wheat flour [wheat flour, barley malt, niacin, iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid], water, sugar, yeast, soybean oil, wheat gluten, salt, vinegar, calcium sulfate, citric acid, ascorbic acid, enzymes), butter oil (soybean oil, palm oil, salt, natural butter flavor and beta carotene for color), pickle (cucumbers, water, vinegar, salt, calcium chloride, alum, potassium sorbate [preservatives], natural flavors, polysorbate 80, yellow 5, blue 1)."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit a chick-fil-a, I am usually creeped out by how OVERLY friendly everyone is. Maybe I came in after a rough day for the team here, because the cashier that helped me seemed kind of .. flat? There was no \"WELCOME TO CHICK-FILA\" no \"MY PLEASURE\" today, it was a simple take my order and no smiles. I came back to ask a question after getting my food and it took me a while to get the cashiers attention. Nevertheless, I love my sweet tea mixed lemonadge and nuggets.

oh well, guess back to the drive thru i go."}
{"text":"Waited 22 min for a grill chicken combo mind u only after asking 15 min in, was compensated with gift cards."}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food. I don't know if the Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich is healthier than anything else, but it really does taste yummy. I have to remember to ask them to leave off the pickle. Oh, and the waffle fries. Awesome!

Drive through was quick and efficient. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after getting my car worked on across the street for breakfast. Their Chicken Biscuits are every bit as good as their later-in-the-day Chicken Sandwiches. And they also have other breakfast classics available including platters with eggs and bacon or sausage. But it was just a friendly pass through the drive through today for the sandwich (which was excellent), hash browns (not as good as the waffle fries) and a coffee (meh). Quick, efficient, accurate. It's what I like to see."}
{"text":"Busy at lunch time, but I do like a good Chicken sandwich and this is an awesome one. Plus, WAFFLE FRIES.

When it's busy, they have extra helpers out and about to make the experience busier. Such as the guy walking the drive through lane to get orders paid faster. Or the lady refilling drinks and helping get people seated."}
{"text":"Friendly folks at this CFA, which had something wrong with their ordering board so they were taking orders in person. Very organized, very slick and super friendly folks. I even kidded the gal at the window that she had a CFA jacket and she actually has a sweater, hat and more. Funny!

Yep, my chicken sandwich with no pickle was perfect. Nice and hot, nice and fresh. The waffle fries were the usual awesome.

Well done, CFA!"}
{"text":"Meeting a friend for lunch, we had a little miscommunication. He went to the wrong one, so I got to see two CFA's for lunch in one day. Like the other, this one was very busy at lunch time. I guess people are thinking that chicken is healthier than the other options in this shopping plaza?

Large seating area, they have a couple of staff wandering around to improve things. The drink lady is a nice touch and she's super friendly. She even refilled the drink I'd brought from the other CFA, though that's probably not the usual deal.

My friend and I took up the table for a good hour and no one troubled us at all!"}
{"text":"Since they opened this CFA in Charlotte's airport, it's never been open when I've been here. I usually leave from Charlotte on Sunday (they're closed on Sunday) and I usually get in late on weekdays (they close at a reasonable hour) so this was the first time I've been here and they've been open!

The place was super packed. Like crazy so, with a long line of people to place orders (8 minutes) and a long crowd of people to pick up orders (7 minutes). The line does move as quick as it can, so be patient. If you don't have time, I'd suggest the BK a little further down.

I got the usual Number One (hold the pickle) with waffle fries. My chicken sandwich was excellent. Just as good as any stand-alone CFA. Fresh and hot. Waffle fries were still hot and quite good.

I can only say A-OK because they really need to step it up for the flow of customers here. Not everyone has 15 minutes to wait."}
{"text":"Lately, I have decided to try and go to places that treat their employees well.  Chick-fil-a definitely fits that bill, and their food is delicious.  When I'm trying to eat healthy, I get a chicken sandwich with no bun and a side salad.  My daughter likes the chicken nuggets, the soup, and of course, the waffle fries.  This location is in the mall so it's a good stop when you're out shopping.  The only problem I have with Chick-fil-a was the anti-gay controversy they engaged in a year or so ago but, I realize that that 1 owner doesn't speak for all store owners so I try not to hold it against them."}
{"text":"The Raintree local is excellent.  I admire their customer service and how the staff says \"my pleasure' instead of the common \"no problem'.   The drive in is efficient as is the interior service.  But don't get in the drive thru if running late--never a good idea to get boxed in!!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Chik-fil-A? Their food is good and the preparation is consistent. This location in particular always has very friendly staff. Remember that they are closed on Sundays. I've caught myself pulling in there a couple times only to realize that I'm there on a day that they are closed. I appreciate that they are closed on Sundays and holidays so their staff can spend time with their families, however, so I don't mind one bit."}
{"text":"I frequent this location quite often.  As with the Univ. City location, service is prompt and courteous.  I really appreciate having someone in the dining area to assist me if needed.  I don't often need help, but they are there if needed.  Once I brought in a party of kids.  Fortunately, the birthday party room was not reserved.  We were able to promptly order our individual meals and sit in the party room to continue the festivities.  The staff was nice enough to bring plates, forks, etc. as well so that we could enjoy our cake.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for always providing great service.  I was not a frequent visitor to Chick-Fil-A's for a long time but I am now a fan!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this location for a while now.  The staff are aways courteous and prompt and service is always pleasant.  Yes, they will bring you more condiments and bring your food to the table, if necessary.  If I need assistance, I don't have to look far and I LOVE THAT!  Perhaps there may be too many people working at one time, but it works because service is always prompt and courteous.  Thank you Chick-Fil-A for having a restaurant location I can aways count on to make me feel wecomed.  I have to agree with Chad E.  The only thing that can be improved at this location is the parking.  If you park in front, you have to cross the drive-through to get into the store, and the drive-through it is always busy."}
{"text":"I really enjoy stopping by this Chick-Fil-A on my way home from the University area.  Service is always quick and pleasant and I can get in and out quickly!"}
{"text":"Service is always fast and friendly at this location. I like to stop here with the kids after leaving the mall. Even if we just want some ice cream or a milkshake, we make it an event. I look forward to the special holiday shakes!  FYI - It is my understanding (from a national survey)  that Chick-Fil-A is the only place that cleans their kids' play area!  Once in a while I let them play!"}
{"text":"First let me say this is a Chick-Fil-A Express so it doesn't have all the menu ideas that a traditional location would have but they have the staple items like chicken biscuit & chicken minis for breakfast, reg & grilled chicken sandwich, reg nuggets, and grilled market salad for lunch as well as hash browns and waffles fries and can't forget the lemonade. 

This location works off the banks schedule so they are only opened M- F from 7:30a to 3p. And of course lunch time is super busy with both BoA and JWU students. But the line moves pretty fast and there's hardly ever a long wait. As its self serve so you just grab what you want and pay at the register.

The staff is always friendly and working hard. The food is always fresh as you can see them making it in the back and refilling all the food. 

Every time I come I'm pretty much in and out. I have no complaints with this location. Other than the menu being a little limited and the hours being different, it's still the same great chicken sandwich, fries, and lemonade you get from any other Chick-Fil-A."}
{"text":"I love love love Chicfila!!!!!! They always have great customer service at any which one that I may go to. Now this one in particular was very clean and cozy. Not extremely packed and they greeted me at the door. When I sat down they brought the food to me and said, \"if you need anything else Monet just let us know we'll happily assist you.\" Which was another plus because they acknowledged my name. Now granted I came for breakfast on a rainy day but they still were on point."}
{"text":"Love this location.  Always so friendly.  This week was above and beyond great. Thanks to our cashier Lou.  She is a true blessing. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this chick fil a the employees talk over me while I'm trying to ask about the sauce for my sandwich. Every time they say sauce is in the bag; talking over me, and very time they forget the sandwich sauce."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a coming to Las Vegas was music to my ears! Growing up in Houston, this was a staple fast food joint. I frequent this location with co-workers for lunch outings and today's visit was rather pleasant. I ordered the usual 12 piece nugget and waffle fries meal, and my friends had grilled chicken nuggets and chicken strip meals. We were all highly satisifed. I usually use the drive thru and this time we ate in. While this location is always  pretty busy, they do an excellent job turning over tables and getting the cars in the drive thru their orders quickly. I have to say, the welcoming demeanor of the staff there is wonderful. They are all so friendly and  Brooklyn, Angelika, and everyone there went above and beyond. Well done, management is doing an excellent job."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Chicken Man,
My family and I were ecstatic to hear about the news of a Chick Fil A coming to our city. After driving a long time and waiting in the drive thru forever, we were saddened to find that our request for a few chick fil a sauces was not fulfilled. We were given one sauce for 36 nuggets. Although the chicken pieces were amazing as we have had before, we hope if we decide to venture far away again for more meals we can get enough sauces."}
{"text":"Let me just say how happy I am to indulge in the spicy chicken breakfast biscuit and hash browns. I first started this terrible addiction while in CO and to my defense I was pregnant. Morning runs to chick-fil-a became the norm. So yes I am a very happy local to now have this place here. This is the only location I go to. Lines can get long but the staff is very efficient so you are not waiting long. If it's not early in the am I order the basic chicken finger meal with chick-fil-a sauce... this is where I took one star off. Every time I go I request EXTRA sauce.... I never ended up with extra. So I stopped requesting it and I still ended up with 2 sauces. I am guessing this is their standard policy. 2 sauces per bag? Well, last night I made a run... ordered the fingers and specifically asked for 4 sauces... I ended up with 2 again! Haha This is my only problem which is so petty but you know I have to dip my waffle fries into the sauce as well.... So, I am thinking the next time I go through the line when I am given my food I will just ask for more sauces instead of trusting it's already in the bag...."}
{"text":"Really good service and friendly staff. Definitely better then other fast food places. Also a very clean building which is also a nice change from other fast food restaurants.

We come here mostly for breakfast. I like the spicy biscuit sandwich and my husband likes the bagel one. We also enjoy the little hash brown bites. I get the iced coffee which isn't super sweet or milky. Had a different taste then McDonald's. I like it but can't put my finger on the taste. Their chicken nuggets are good, actually taste like chicken and has the texture of real chicken. I like the variety of sauces the have too. Been here for lunch a few times and the drive thru was super busy. I had a chicken sandwich with bacon. It was good but didn't blow me away. Overall, good food, better quality then other fast food places, and good service."}
{"text":"In the immortal words of Leo Getz: \"They f*ck you at the drive-thru!\"

I love me some Chik-Fil-A, but good lord.  This location has never, not once, gotten an order completely right.  & it's not even complicated orders, they just completely forget an entire pack of Chick-n-Minis.

However, they are incredibly nice even while screwing up - seriously the happiest, most polite fast food employees ever, hence the 4 stars.  Just make sure you check your food before driving off."}
{"text":"Great spot for mommy groups to take the kids, let them play and get in a yummy chicken sandwich. 

Today, a few moms from our moms group planned to meet here for lunch. We arrived at approximately 11:30 and found a table near the play area. Kids ate before we sent them off. They had a little craft table set up in the middle of the dining area. The kids took a little break from playing to do a couple crafts which was great. 

Definitely will plan another meet up here soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always good to people are unbelievably polite and the place is always very clean. The only beef I have is with the people that bring their kids there and turn them loose in the playroom without supervising them."}
{"text":"absolutely love chick-fil-a! before this place arrived to Nevada, my boyfriend and i would drive all the way to St. George, Utah just to eat some chick-fil-a and go hiking. but yes sometimes we go there just for chick-fil-a lol 

their customer service is amazing! they work so diligently and effectively to ensure everyone is happy and being helped. they have a good working system going, especially when they get busy! they're always so friendly and polite. 

there was only one time where an employee was taking orders at the door and completely skipped over us. even if there was a reason as to why she had to skip us, she could have at least told us why- bc if not, we are just going to make assumptions and i would hate to make a wrong one. she skipped us and went to the people behind us. it was her and another employee taking mobile orders before reaching the cashiers. there was a couple behind us being helped from one employee. and then there was the girl that skipped us that went to the people behind those people. 

other than that one time, i always enjoy coming to chick-fil-a! their pricing is decent but a little pricey for fast food. it's comparable to raising canes."}
{"text":"6 month update:

Unfortunately this location has gone down to two stars for us. It hovers between two and three. I'll start with the positives... solidly consistent yummy food, friendly staff, and the drive thru moves quickly. We usually go through the drive thru because we're coming from one thing, or going to another, and are in a hurry. 

Now for the negatives. We brushed off the drive thru debacles for a while because the restaurant was new. However, they are six months in now, and it's getting worse. The drive thru does move very quickly; but, I'd honestly rather it not move so fast if it meant they'd get my darned order right!

Every time we have visited in the past couple of months, we get home to not only find sauce missing, but more importantly, part of someone's meal. Not only is it frustrating when you live too far away to go back and get it, but we are also paying for a meal we don't get to eat, and someone in the family doesn't get to eat it. If we're lucky, sometimes they'll still include the fries and drink, but no chicken with the meal. I have even started asking before I pull away if everything is in the bags, and am assured it is although I come home and find out it isn't. I don't have the time to pull over in the parking lot, rummage through everything, and go inside to get my missing food. I really hope they improve this, because we are/were regular customers who are now choosing more often than not to go somewhere else to make sure we get all of our food.


First of all, so, so, so, so excited that I don't have to only have Chic-Fil-A when I'm in UT or CA! So happy they are here in Vegas, finally! Went to get lunch today expecting a madhouse, but used their app and it wasn't too bad. The three stars is for the fact that we ordered a bunch of sauces (the chic-fil-a sauce makes the meal for me). When we got our order, my husband asked the person who helped us to please make sure we got our sauces. She politely said that she checked, and the sauces were in one of the bags. We get home to sadly find out that she did not check. I get it, it's the opening weekend and it's crazy, but don't say you checked when you clearly didn't. We will be back when it calms down a bit... hopefully all will be well the next go around!"}
{"text":"How can you not love Chick-fil-A??

After being deprived of Chick-fil-A in my undergrad years in Michigan, I am so glad I live 5 minutes away from one now. I still remember when they came out with the Spicy Chicken Sandwich when I was a senior in high school. It's still my favorite sandwich.

You can tell they emphasize customer service, almost to a fault. The niceties seem a little forced from the young employees, but I remember I was once like that. Practice makes perfect! And Chick-fil-A makes perfect."}
{"text":"No chicken in the chicken tortilla soup! Who ever the manager scheduled on 10/18/2017 was, they should be fired. The quality of food compared to other locations was inferior. How does a place that only serves chicken make a chicken tortilla soup with no chicken. There was nothing but beans with a dash of other items. I have had the soup before and enjoyed it from other locations. 

To be clear I am talking about the poor quality from the San Tan Market Street Location."}

{"text":"I'm a fan of CFA, folks.  Having cut the majority of fast-food from my life, this is one place that leaves me feeling less guilty.  

The staff members at this location are always friendly, and the drive through line always progresses quickly.  The dining room is always clean as well.  I don't think I can ever recall a time when my order was wrong either.

I worked in Concord Mills Mall, directly across the street, for 6+ years. This CFA was one of my goto lunch spots.  The food court gets old quick!  When I wanted a less expensive, semi healthy option, to CFA I went!

I am disappointed that they removed the lemon meringue pie from the menu a few years ago.  However, the avocado lime ranch dressing is awesome enough to make up for it!

The only downside to this CFA location, although I've not seen them in a while, is the religious group that exercises their right to freedom of speech on the public corner out front.  They scream at passersby and proclaim righteousness.  I find it distasteful and annoying.  I once mentioned it to the manager of the CFA.  He said that they have tried to get them to leave, but they are legally within their rights.  He assured me that their rants are in no way affiliated with the restaurant."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Four stars.

I don't think the location listed is actually the spot, it seems more to the north. I fell in love with Chick-Fil-A while going to ASU and living in the MU. My Maroon and Gold card got burnt up at the CFA there, and ever since I'll get in the mood for a run. This spot is off the 101 Loop, and when headed that way it makes it tough to pass by without swinging in the drive-thru. I just get the basic chicken sandwich. I don't care much for the extra stuff on the menu. This is kind of like the In-N-Out of chicken, for me....No Animal style, etc, that I am aware of though."}
{"text":"The waits is still very long. They put the chicken sandwiches in a small sack that makes the skin really soggy"}
{"text":"As usual well organized and very friendly staff. Very busy location inside and the drive thru as well. The drive thru had staff outside walking up to cars deep in the lineups taking orders and keeping everything moving smoothly. Highly recommended and the food was great."}
{"text":"The quality is always consistent at this location.  They consistently maintain a high sanitation grade. They currently hold a grade of 97.5.  This location is always busy.  The employees are nice. During the holidays I like to order my food trays from here because they know how to get an order right."}
{"text":"Always great and consistent......grilled chicken sandwich is my favorite. This location has a limitted menu so if you dont like standard items, chiecken strips and such dont think you are going to get cutesie with your order. Even though they may appear busy, super fast so dont fret."}
{"text":"This location is constantly out of items, today it was fruit cups and grilled cool wraps. I had to wait in line 10 minutes to find this out. They are also very slow. Ive tried ordering ahead on the app but it seems to take even longer and you have to go inside."}
{"text":"Love their chicken sandwiches and biscuits! Their lemonade is awesome, as well. The service at this location is always fast and friendly. The food is hot and fresh. I stop here pretty often for breakfast on my way to work. You can order a sandwich instead of a biscuit for breakfast, if you prefer! :)"}

{"text":"Great place for a fast lunch. Easy to get to location. They do a great job during the lunch hour of preordering while in line so that your food is ready once you are at the register. 

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the size of the dine in portion of this location. It's not very big and tucked in the back. But this doesn't seem to be an issue for those working uptown."}
{"text":"I usually go in to order with my boyfriend because that drive thru is no joke, always around the corner, full of cars. Inside it's usually not busy at all so we get our food within a couple of minutes. We've had instances where they have our food ready before we even pay! It is always clean and well kept. We always have some one come and check on us and sometimes throw away our stuff for us. We have never had any bad experience here so we will continue to return for the great customer service and food. Thank you! Also love the freebies that we get on the app, keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"The lines for the drive they are massive, however, they often have at least two employees in the parking lot with menus and inputting orders and accepting payments. By the time you make it to the window you're being handed your bag of food. Makes the line go faster by expediting the orders and payment. The inside is nice and you'll be waited on. There's a play place inside the restaurant. Food is always hot. Staff is very nice. It's \"my pleasure\" to eat here"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Fast service. The food is always good here. I've stopped here and dined in and order through the drive thru. I've enjoyed the food and service here."}
{"text":"Not the best picture but what it means is ; they took care of my sauce request,One extra for each, gave me napkins , got my order right ,Gave me a coupon. Gave me a hand wipe sanitizer and made my chicken sandwich extra juicy!"}
{"text":"Damn Homie.  This chicken is good.

I had Chick-fil-A for the first time a few years ago in Kansas City.  My wife kept telling me it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, so I had to give it a shot.  It was pretty good, not the most amazing chicken ever but very good, and the service at that location was fantastic.  The manager personally took us under his wing and made us feel like we were both appreciated and at a real restaurant.  Needless to say, for a fast food chain I was more than impressed.

Well, now Madison has a Chick-fil-A.  I went on opening day to give it another shot, and they had both the service and crowd under control.  They had brought in employees from some of their southern stores and were actually assisting people with traffic, the drive through, you name it.  I've never seen something like this for a fast food chain, they realized how popular it would be and planned appropriately.  That's not to say there weren't a million people trying to get there, but the lines flowed smoothly and soon enough I had my delicious chicken strips, sandwhich and waffle fries.

If there's anything to knock, it's that the menu is pretty limited.  The food I mentioned above is just about all there is to it.  They have shakes as well, they're pretty solid.  But that chicken.  Oh man is it good.  Fresh taste, not some KFC \"what did I just eat\" mess.  It's uber tasty.  

Sadly, as much as I planned to just \"give them a chance\", I found myself there the next 3 days straight.

Ruh Roh.  #TastyHeartAttack

P.S.  For what's it worth, I'm reviewing their restaurant not their politics, so don't shoot me! :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding experience ! They served my soccer team about 28 people faster and with smile."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional up to coming in contact with manager.  She bad mouthed her staff and offered to help me.  I made my request and she gave me something else.  I told her what I had asked for.  She accused me of lying.  She was in a Tshirt.   She was harsh and demanded to make the point she was right.  The staff visibly tensed up in her presence.  Such a shame as the employees were very hospitable.  I hope the leadership above her will take notice. I hope Montana is alright as she publicly made demands of her.  Not appropriate."}
{"text":"I've lived in Atlanta and southern California where chick fil a used to be my main source of food.. I was very excited to have one in vegas but this is NOT Chik fila... thry need to train the employees how to fry them. Chicken and the buns... waste of money"}

The (what looked to be all teenage) staff were polite & had wonderful customer service, the food was great, the restrooms were clean & smelled good, haha. Random but true. If ever in the area again....this will definitely be my safe spot to chill in the city."}
{"text":"I love Chick Fil A , I go probably 3 times a week because I work next to the one on 44th street and Indian School. I had the worst experience this morning at the one in Avondale with Sabrina and Ruben. They did not handle the situation well and I know chick fil A is great on customer service today showed me other wise and I kind of don't want to go back. Thanks Ruben and Sabrina!"}
{"text":"This location does not live up to the expectations I have of Chick Fil A. This location is on my way to work, so I get breakfast here at least once a week, sometimes twice. My issue has never been with the food, it's always hot and delicious. My issue is with the employees. I've always said please and thank you (my mother raised me with manners). Usually when I visit a CFA and say \"thank you\" I'm met with a \"my pleasure\", this location occasionally says \"you're welcome\", but never \"my pleasure\". It's this little things that make a difference. Additionally, I get frustrated because every other trip I make there they try to get me to order a small soda. I usually only order a sandwich, and tell them \"that's all thank you\" literally half the time the girl at the window puts down a small coke. Why?"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Chick-Fil-A? The original chicken sandwich and waffle fries is the best combo and compared to other fast food options, its not terribly horrible for you.  But,if you are really trying to be good, the grilled chicken sandwich is good.  You can ask for no butter on the bun and order a side salad. If you really want to be bad, they have yummy brownies and ice cream.  

Also, the people who work at Chick Fil A are so nice and friendly!  They always say, \"my pleasure\" instead of \"your welcome.\" See for yourself!  They will refill your drink and clear your table and ask you you're doing.  Its like fast food with sit down style courtesy.

We all complain that Chick Fil A is closed on Sundays, but I like it because it makes the other 6 days  that you can go to Chick Fil A even more special!  Haha!"}
{"text":"Service is above and beyond,  chicken is great...  The prices are insanely high. Still don't understand why it's so busy.  I have a business meeting nearby every week and come here when I am early,  out of the 40 times I have been here I have only eaten here 3 times.. What"}

Also, it's nice they have free wi-fi and accept AMEX... that's right... my rewards mean everything to me right now! 

I haven't tried anything else, as I just get the grilled plain sandwich on whole grain with a glass of water... maybe one day I will try the fried chicken!!! 

Oh if you go online to there website and make a reservation for breakfast, you can get a free breakfast sandwich! Love the freebies... too bad the breakfast sandwiches are too high in calorie and fat for me right now as I'm dieting..."}

{"text":"Let me preface this with I eat Chick-FIl-A a lot (not proud...) Yesterday I went into the North Olmsted location and ordered my usual number 1... as I took a bite into my chicken sandwich I noticed something was wrong. The sandwich was extremely rubbery and the texture was nauseating. I told the manager and he offered me ANOTHER sandwich... I said I didn't want another due to the fact that clearly something was wrong with the first. He just said sorry. No refund. No offer of another menu item which was less nauseating. Just a sorry. Threw away the rubbery remains of my lunch. I left. Sad. Hungry. Confused."}
{"text":"I love me some Chick-fil-A. This was the first drive-thru one I saw outside of the South. Imagine my poultry-driven joy!

I only ate here once, but it was tasty. Always is. These stores rock when it comes to consistency. My mom loves the fact that this store serves diet caffeine-free Coke, which barely anyone else keeps on fountain. My mom also said the manager is very nice and does a fantastic job w/his crew, so I've gotta believe what she says. Ya know, 'cause moms are smart."}
{"text":"Today's rating is based on my first visit to this location today. The food is great and the staff was professional and courteous. The walk in line moved fairly quick as they had employees taking your order before reaching the cashier. However there was one blemish to my visit today. They left two items off my order. When I got home I found I was missing 2 Spicy Deluxe sandwiches. If there were half stars.. I would actually give 3 1/2 stars because of the customer service I got when I called about the missing items and when I returned to the restaurant. Courteous and accommodating but surprisingly no apologies about the error. My fault for not double checking the accuracy of my order before I left to save me a 25 minute round trip. When I was waiting for my missing sandwiches, I overheard a little girl tell an employee she was missing some items from her order."}
{"text":"We go on a regular basis (it's one of the few takeout places with a play place in town). I'm not a huge fan of the price but the service is always excellent and the play place is always clean."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chick-fil-A location. The dining room was nice and clean and the employee was walking around with sanitary wipes (no dirty rags) wiping down tables and counters. Each table had fresh cut flowers too; wow! The food was fresh, made to order.
We tried their breakfast sausage burrito and chick-n-minis. Both comes with drink and potato tots if you get them as a meal. Both were really tasty. Will return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The menu isn't as extensive as the Chic Fil A's in the States, but if you have a craving for their famous chicken sandwiches, it will do the trick. Order the waffle fries and be sure to ask for Polynesian sauce and chic fil a sauce to dip. Polynesian sauce goes amazing with the chicken and the chic fl a sauce is soooo good with the fries. Service is eh...I've been here 3 times and each time location seems under staffed. So it's not the fastest or friendliest service you'll get. So if they could improve the service, then I would give a higher rating. This location is at the airport, so park in shot term 30 min free parking."}
{"text":"We've ordered number one deluxe meal with vanilla shake and spicy deluxe sandwich only both no pickle to go but very disappointed once we got home coz the spicy deluxe sandwich was replaced with just a plain chicken sandwich...... my husband loves this place but after this second incident he's boycotting this place until they can get their shit together."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure WHY Chick-fil-A is the hype. Because it was on our \"to try\" list, we gave it a spin.

First of all, when you get through the long line that spans out the door, the ordering process is straightforward. The line, however, does move quite fast. So even though it's outside, you'll move fairly quickly. The drive thru, that's another story. The line was spanning out of the parking lot onto Rancho Drive during lunch. I wouldn't bother. Probably would be best to order via the app and pick it up and the pick-up window, which they do have.

I tried the 12-piece nuggets combo with the waffle cut fries. I try nuggets everywhere, so I'd like to think that I'm a connoisseur of chicken nuggets. And you know, I honestly didn't think that the nuggets were all that great. This would be dead last on my list. There is a hint of sweetness to the batter, which I found to be odd. I also felt that I HAD to dip it in ketchup or the sauce in order to make it taste decent. I had ranked Burger King on the list of chicken nuggets that were dead last because they don't taste too good. The Chick-fil-A ones, they are now dead last. Heck, Burger King's nuggets are wonderful compared to Chick-fil-A. 

My wife tried the chicken sandwich. She said it was \"forgettable.\" I took a bite of the breaded patty, and while it was \"decent,\" it was forgettable. 

The waffle cut fries, however, was quite good. But you can't just have great fries! You need tasty main dishes as well, and sadly, Chick-fil-A does not. And to be honest, Carl's Jr. has better waffle cut fries.

We ordered and dined in. The food arrived quickly and was adequate in temperature. I like how they will bring the food to your table.

Maybe we will go back and try them again. Maybe we will try something else. But until then, we have no desire to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"I wish we could give zero ratings, cause this place would get a zero but since I can't I'll give a one. This place is not good at all the chicken is too over priced and really why does Metro need to be there directing us in. This is JUST another place to eat. I think they have more important things to do than deal with a fast food place traffic. Really now? I will not visit this fast food place again. Their food is dry and not tasty at all. I'm not even sure what all the hype about these places are. I would rather have other REAL chicken places to eat than eat here again.  Thumbs down for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a staple for when my preschooler needs to let out some energy and we're all hungry. Food is always fresh, service is always outstanding."}
{"text":"WORST chick-fil-a ever! They completely ruin the reputation of the franchise! 
Ordered a salad, they gave me the wrong salad.  Went back, they gave me another one. 
Got back to my car to eat the fries that I also ordered and they weren't even cooked. Horrible. I thought I would never see the day that I said this about a Chick-fil-a"}
{"text":"Really enjoy their chicken sandwiches. They are never dry and always super moist. The prices are a bit higher than I would like, but it's not a bad deal. My kids love their chicken nuggets but they are not big fans of the waffle fries. I would prefer regular fries over waffle ones. 

I know they are closed on Sundays for religious beliefs maybe that's why we had to wait in the drive thru for 20 minutes. They were definitely packed at almost 2pm."}
{"text":"Why is it just me who thought the chicken sandwich was HORRIBLE!  i loved the waffle fries, but the sandwich was about 4 diameter and very thick (2-3\") and partially covered with breading..  I HATE thick chicken!  Why can't they hammmer it down to about 1/2\", bread it, and make the breading stick to it??
I gave the chicken to the dogs and they did eat it.
I have no desire to go back just for fries."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff here.  It is very rare that I have had any errors in my order.  Food is always hot, but they put a TON of ice in the drinks."}
{"text":"This place is usually good and service is fair but today i ordered a Bacon egg and cheese biscuit, somehow ended up with a chicken egg bagel? On top of that i had to drive back 10+ mins to return it. Once i got to the store i waited 15 mins before i had a new sandwich because they forgot about my order while i was there. Understandably it was kinda busy they didn't even offer to replace the hash browns that are now cold. I don't mind an occasional mess up on my order but they did nothing to try to make up for it."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd leave a one star for a chick Fil a.    The only reason is because I had to put some type of star on there. 

I like my chick Fil a a certain way. Extra pickles. I asked for it on the side so I can have it with my fries and sandwich. I reiterated to the checkout thst I wanted extra extra pickles.  I got a little plastic cup with 2 pickles in it.  I went back up and asked for a cup of pickles a s received three more little cups so now I have 6 pickles.  I got to the Fries and it was 4 waffles fries and the rest broken little bits.  My cookie( can't have a meal with out a cookie at chick Fil a ) was nice and cold.  When I asked for the pickles, the manger in the black shirt asked the other shift manager to get me a cup. He came back with the extra little plastic cup. Nobody checked up on me except for an employee, roman, and today is his first day. Maybe he can teach the management about customer service. After a long drive and being from the south a chick Fil a was all I wanted and excited to see it.  I guess I'll have to wait to get back to Georgia for a better experience and food.  
A shake shack would have been better. Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy menu of fresh salads for lunch or delicious chic sandwich options with their uniquely cut fries for dinner.  Had breakfast for first time Monday 7am and found coffee surprisingly bold & tasty with their yummy hash brown tots & fresh egg, sausage & cheese biscuit!!  Will be back for more of that!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not so much of a fast food eater, but I wanted to comment on the management of this place.  I met the owner when he came by our school to talk about fundraising opportunities.  What a nice, thoughtful man!  Talking to him made me want to go to Chik-fil-a for only the second time in my life.  My sandwich was good (I just wish I knew that you had to ask separately for things to be put on it!) so it consisted of only chicken, bun, and pickles.  The waffle fries were delicious.  We will be back again some night when I'm just too tired to make dinner at home."}

{"text":"First, the patrons get a negative two stars for rudeness. The was a lot of pushing, seat hogging, and cutting you off in the dining room for seats. My young daughter commented how rude people were and I agree. We ordered sandwiches and got meals. My order had a random chicken sandwich in it when we left. The sauces for the chicken tenders all tasted full of sugar which seemed weird. The BBQ sauce made both of us gag with the extraordinary sweetness. Original sauce seemed the best. I didn't ask for a meal with fries, just a sandwich, so the bill for two came out for $18. Not a good value at all for just fast food. The frozen lemonade was orgasmic so three stars instead of two are given.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! But won't be coming back unless something changes.
Got my order messed up twice and was given really hard fries that weren't even edible. 
So sad :("}

As I've stated in previous reviews, I'm crazy picky when it comes to what I like to eat. This location is *outstanding* because they always get my order right. My food is always nice and hot and the chicken is never dry.  The employees are always super polite and professional, the restaurant is always clean, and the food is always deeeelicious.

Thanks again Joyce for refilling my drink so I could keep an eye on my little one!"}

{"text":"The owner of this Chick-fil-A is great!  He is always on site and assuring his customers get quality food, respectable staff and a clean restaurant.  We arrived today at 2 pm as a kind gentleman opened the door and greeted us.  He recognized my sister-n-law as a frequent customer and thanked her for being a loyal customer to his Chick-fil-A.    The staff here took the time to make sure we understood any changes or additions to the menu.  
A Chick-fil-A fan for life."}
{"text":"I don't normally give five starts to a fast food place; after all, the service tends to be the same.  Not this place, though. Even though it's not an upscale restaurant, they treat their customers very much like valued visitors and the service is always excellent.

Plus, they have reliable WiFi!"}
{"text":"Each and every time I have been here (drive through or eat in) the staff is so nice and he food is good. No cold fries or greasy dry chicken here. Food order is always accurate and they whip you through the drive through in no time. Pretty much exceeds expectations for a fast food chain"}

{"text":"For some reason this is the only chick fila that gives me issues. From my frys being old to never giving me a fork. They stuff three meals in one bag, which bothers me. Shouldn't every meal get their own bag. That way it's less likely to tip over in my car. I never get a cup holder, or enough sauce. I got three large frys and grilled nuggets, do you truely believe 2 sauces is enough? Back to my fork issue, do they really expect me to eat my mac n cheese and grilled nuggets with my hands? Oh and don't get me started on napkins, two napkins isn't enough for one person so why would it be enough for 4? Three large meals and a large mac n cheese need about 12 napkins thank you. Really the people there need to pretend like they're the ones recovering this good and treat other people the way they'd like to be treated. Maybe because it's all young selfish kids working there, they lack common respect and common sense. There's more to your job then just wearing a half ass smile. Also do NOT give me diet lemonade if you run out of lemonade! I'm not dumb I can taste the difference! Let me know you're out, Im a reasonable person that will simply change my drink to something else. This place has failed me time and time again. Why do I return? Well it's the closest one to my house, my family loves chick fila, it's the only fast food we'll eat, and I figured it was just that one time. Each time I catch myself saying that, oh maybe they were busy, maybe it's new staff, maybe they got a lot on their minds. NOPE! They just suck. I was the only person in the Drive thru, they truely just suck and gave me old frys and old grilled chicken that stunk up my house when I opened it! Dumb ass kids I swear!"}
{"text":"Altamente recomiendo esta cadena comercial de pollo si buscas algo rápido, rico y saludable. Con muy buen servicio!"}
{"text":"So glad there's a Chick-Fil-A at the Airport! 

A perfect place to pick up breakfast on the go en-route to my gate for a morning flight. 

They let you order lunch foods too during the mornings, but note it might take them a bit longer to cook since they'd be making the order just for you (versus already having a batch of lunch items ready).

Nothing beats a chicken biscuit with waffle fries to kick start the morning. 

Definitely try out the Honey BBQ and Chick-Fil-A sauces :) They're AMAZING with everything!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Chick-Fil-a? This is the one fast food place that I do no feel guilty about eating. Sure, it's still fried, but at least I am getting real food here. No fake or of processed food here. Thanks goodness. 

The spicy chicken sandwiches are my favorite, followed by the chicken nuggets and fries. I always get fries. 

This location is always busy. It is the only one of its kind in the area, so if you want It, your going there. The staff isn't the greatest. Oftentimes they run slow. I almost always see someone clueless at the register. I'm not complaining, I will look past this. 

My grandkids are the biggest fans. This is the perfect place to take them for lunch and be confident that they will eat. I only wish they were open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Seriously can't get enough of this place. I've been here too many times and became a regular  since they first opened that some workers already know what I'm going to order! So grateful I don't have to drive all the way to Cali or Arizona when I'm craving (which is all the time haha). Whether you are ordering take-out, dining in, or drive thru, the customer service and food is always outstanding. 

The original Chick Fil A sandwich paired with sweet iced tea is definitely my favorite. But you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love taking my family here, they all love it and we get to share quality time with quality food. This is starting to sound like an ad, but I swear its not! I can never see myself getting tired of this place. Awesome food + even more awesome customer service, what else can you ask for??"}
{"text":"This is a great location and all the employees have a great smile on their face always walking by tables make sure everything is ok or if anyone needs anything.

The food is always delicious and the play area for kids is perfect"}
{"text":"***Review update. I have since gone back to Chick-fil-A and they are very generous now with their sauces. Thank you!

Foods great, but ownership has become cheap accountants.  Was just informed by management that they can only distribute two sauces per flavor.  Apparently this Chick-fil-a went over the sauce budget distribution.  I know there's a certain cost associated with sauce - but you have become cheap like other fast food businesses.  I like your sauces they really add to the flavor and enhance the overall taste and pleasure.

Because of the above issue I won't eat at any Chick-fil-a in the Las Vegas valley.  I'll take my family to another place of business like Canes Chicken."}
{"text":"So delicious! 
Great place. Great food. Great service. The girl at the drive thru with zebra arms is the cutest.. 
Highly recommend this place to fill your chicken needs.. bock bock bock"}
{"text":"Ok, so overall this is a good CFA (although it could never beat the one on Woodlawn @ Park), and it's uber-convenient for me since it's around the corner from my house.  However where they need to improve is their DRIVE-THRU customer service (inside service is always great).  More specifically, they need to pay more attention to orders taken at the drive-thru.  Now I am admittedly more critical than most in the cust service arena (c/s trainer here) and the occasional mistake is to be expected & overlooked, but my gosh; more often than not these days it seems that there's always \"something\" with the ordering process here, and Daniel's nerves are about shot.  There's also one employee, that out of kindness will remain nameless, that tends to fowl things up more than others, so when I hear her name come over the speaker I cringe. 

Anyhoo...So VERY often I seem to pull up to the window & the person that took my order missed something completely (like this morning, requiring a second CC transaction...annoying), or I check my order & something has been left off, or a special request wasn't filled.  FAR too often I've ordered a DELUXE chicken sandwich and received a \"regular\" chicken sandwich (but it's correct on the receipt).  Last week I ordered a spicy chicken deluxe and received, yet again, a regular chicken sandwich.  I could go on, but how boring would that be, right?! :)

I learned a long time ago that I MUST check my order before leaving, or I'll have to return to have something corrected.  Part of what irritates me more than anything, is the only thing I've gotten from the mgmt there is an \"I'm sorry sir.\"  Not even a free drink to make up for their many mistakes.   Don't get me wrong, I'm not LOOKING for a freebie by any means, but I mean c'mon now.  I spend a good bit 'o money here (and they know me well since I'm here often), so just sayin'.

Aside from the sketchy drive-thru service and necessary double checking of orders, this IS a good CFA as far as quality of food goes.  And they seem to do a lot of good things for the local neighborhood (Davis Lake) - and it HAS been a welcome addition to the area since it opened.   I still prefer the location on Woodlawn @ Park Rd; they seem to be on point every time I visit.  A close second is the University CFA."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday for the first time ever I see the carry blue cheese dressing and I said yes employees fast friendly service too many of them they should know they don't have blue cheese I am taking my meals to my friends at home"}
{"text":"Update: the manager reached out to me for a free meal which I never received from them but I didn't care for nor expect it. I gave this location another chance and the online ordering experience was much better this time but something is seriously wrong with them making their food consistently. I don't know if I can recommend this location at all."}
{"text":"I still enjoy eating here however am even more happy after learning of breakfast! I am in love with their chicken biscuit with the addition of honey! Mmmmm yummy, I have hubby addicted to those yummy breakfast biscuits as well and this has been added to rotation in our breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"Thanks allegra f but I believe that all restaurants are monitored... How was YOUR experience? It's a nice location, friendly service, nice outdoor seating and easier parking than places on mill.  Glad it's here finally"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A, I understand you're a new store...I get that. I just moved to Vegas from the south so I understand what Chick-fil-A is! I was happy to have moved here and find out there was one here. Chick-fil-A is my all time favorite, But you need to step it up at this location...please see picture. I've had a few issues and have not said anything thinking it would get better. Today I ordered an 8 count nugget and got 6 nuggets and two crumbles of breading. Dave, if you're reading this, please let the kitchen know they need to slow it down and QC these orders going out the window. Never did I think I would give my favorite fast food a 1 star. :/ 

Thanks.


Update. The manager corrected the issue and gave us two free nugget meals."}
{"text":"Pressed for time, so nothing fancy, exotic or overly expensive for lunch today. 

So Chick-Fil-a it was. I always liked this place. No fillers, just straight up chicken on a bun. Tasty as heck Chicken at that. 

This is a fast food chain that is always a pleasure to eat at simply because of the demeanor of the employees. The service is always great and even better than some sit down restaurants. 

I picked up a late lunch at 1:50. My nuggets and fries were a little soggy today, but still tasty nonetheless. Their Polynesian sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel awkward here. Sometimes they are so nice it makes you feel guilty. Sometimes when the drive thru lady starts making conversation it gets creepy. 

Why are you talking to me? Why are you asking me questions? Why do you care about the angry smirk on my face? Can't you just leave me alone so I can wallow in my own self pity?

No matter how grumpy I am, no matter how bad traffic is, these a#$h0les always seem to ruin it and make my day less of a S##T Storm. 

Lucky for them my lil' angel loves their nuggets and refuses to eat any other nuggets from anywhere else. If it wasn't for her, I'd avoid this super nice, always friendly, poor excuse of a restaurant that makes the best chicken sandwich in the world with a super sized side of smiles."}
{"text":"Unfriendly pregnant manager on duty too busy wiping trays off to address a customer concern. Really Jeff, quality of managers deteriorating."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so clean and bright! Acamy was our cashier and has lovely manners and was quick and efficient. Our food was delivered so quickly and exactly right! Santa Cow is adorable!! Great job!!"}
{"text":"Always have had an excellent experience here.  A manager even went out of his way to snag my dad and myself a cookie to share when he was eyeballing them.  Always clean, great service from their employees, and of course always great food.  Love the location since it is so close.  I bring my nieces there a lot for some awesome awesome lunch dates."}
{"text":"Had some issues getting the order in a timely manner but the manager made it up with some free OJ.  Biscuits are fairly good here, especially relative to other fast food options.  Hash rounds come in the cute white boxes.  Convenient location right by the frontage road."}
{"text":"Closed on Sunday?  Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too."}
{"text":"Came in here after having rude service at Sbarro and I'm glad I did. Ethel was fantastic! She was very professional but also very friendly. Working customer service I know how important it is to make your customers happy. This was a great experience and I'm very glad I came here instead. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Not sure what the past reviews were about. Service was pleasant and crew were jovial. Area was clean and condiments well stocked. Manager even walked up to us with  complimentary toy and pen."}
{"text":"Terrible service and order errors caused the low star rating. Gum chomping workers with poor attitudes found here. Add on issues with our orders made for an unhappy visit. We had 3 orders at 3 different registers and probably interacted with 5 different employees. Note to Manager  ~ extra training needed on Saturday night shift.

 All in our party walked away with the same opinion. We will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A is a go to when I am in need of a fast food.  Very high quality ingredients used, always great customer service and a wonderful place for kids.  Not only do the they have an indoor play area, but lots of kids programs. They offer free story times, cow visits, and other special promotional days such as Daddy-daughter date night  and Mother-son date knight, which was a medieval  themed event."}
{"text":"CFA FIRST 100 EVENT!

Well congrats to the operator and his staff on this wonderful location and beautifully crafted store! It's large and I know it will be very prosperous! AZU is down the street and just so excited to be one of the lucky 100 to make it into this event! 

What can I say! The quality of food is at it's top par! Great service at all CFA's that you think to yourself, \"Am I at a fast food restaurant or at a sit down dinner?\" If you have never been or eaten at any CFA, you are missing a great experience! 

BREAKFAST: CLASSIC Chick-fil-a biscuit: warm and flaky bread with the right amount of chicken deliciousness. Add honey or jam and it is a 10 ++!! Ok maybe slightly exaggerated. But overall it will not disappoint. 

LUNCH: 3 Piece chicken strips: I personally like them well done, but they have a different flavor then the nuggets!  I get full of of them alone without the fries... Surprise surprise. Great bang for your cash to get full. ( wish there was a spicy form of this item. O . o )

DINNER: SPICY chicken sandwich with fries: I ordered the sandwich and fries well done protein style. ( I rather eat the fries instead of the bun, less calories). So yummy and with CFA sauce, Texas Pete and ketchup is just to die for! Must mix all three. Sounds weird but don't knock it till you try it! 

DESSERT: Chocolate cookie: It was so yummy. They have out ice dream as well but I was too cold to eat it! 

Great experience can't wait to head back out there! GO ASU!"}
{"text":"Great first 100 event! 

Came all the way from California to make it to this event. The store is beautiful and is updated with the heritage design. There is a drive thru. What I found great was that they have this beautiful table in the store that is made by the men in a prison ministry. Food was great no complaints...

Wonder if they use kosher pickles in their sandwiches. LOL I would ask that question to one of their workers... U should try it!"}
{"text":"World's slowest chick-fil-a. Food was good but took 20 min for 12-count nuggets. Don't stop here unless you have unlimited time."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and not sure if I'll be back. Went last night and waited almost 20 minutes in the drive-thru, which would've been fine, but our fries and protein-style burgers were cold and bland. There was so much lettuce on the burgers, that we couldn't really taste anything and they were the messiest we've ever had. Only giving two stars because the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Yes. I'm into the Chick-fil-A.

Do I think that it's worth lines that wrap around buildings and cause traffic jams? Not really.

It's not that they don't have great service because they do compared to other fast food chains, but the food is never so mind blowing that I can't wait to come back the next time. I don't crave their biscuits. Their waffle fries are crispy and fresh, but I'm just not a die hard fan! The chicken is tender though. I'll give them that.

Their signature sauce is legit though. I'm a big fan of a good sauce. You can call me DoT. Dipper of Things.

And kudos to the guy taking our order outside when the drive-thru was super long. I still think he was saying Sire and not Sir... which he denies, but it was epic."}
{"text":"Usually I don't bother to review fast food restaurants because they're all the same and you should know what you're getting going into it.  This particular Chick-fil-A, however, is the exception to that norm and deserves a review.

BF and I stopped at the Fort Mill Chick-fil-A on our drive up to Carowinds.  It was 11:00 am.  We were there before their lunch rush and it was practically empty.  Despite this, it somehow took 10 minutes for us to get our #1 combo and Spicy Southwest salad.  They weren't out back killing the chicken  They were just collectively the slowest, most inefficient Chick-fil-A employees I've ever encountered.  There were more employees than customers and I honestly don't know what took them so long.

Chick-fil-A is known for being fast and friendly.  They were friendly, but I think corporate Chick-fil-A would have a cow (ha!) if they saw just how slow things happened around here."}
{"text":"I love eating at chick fil a, you can count on good food and friendly service. But NOT at this location. Coke was flat, they were annoyed to give me more than then 1 dipping sauce for nuggets and a waffle fry. I also order a cookie that looked like it was three days old, I asked for a warm one (or to have this old one warmed), they wouldn't. 
DONT COME HERE, go to the one 2 mikes away. 
2 stars is being generous"}
{"text":"I've been here to this location twice for take out and they are at 50% rate for getting the order correct.  This is probably the 3rd time I've eaten at Chick-fil-a in my lifetime.  I've tried it, I've assessed it and it's just okay for me.  The chicken is tender- check, the buns are standard- check, fries- not well done enough for the crisp texture, plus the sauces are not good at all.  To each's own, this is just my opinion, so I'll stick with ketchup.  

I'll have to admit the battered spicy chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese was a little too much spice and I wasn't able to eat it all in one sitting for the acid reflux to set in.  I would say it's better than going to McDonald's or the like as it's still a step up in service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Chickfila's are typically very good, this one isn't.

- Terrible design. The put this Chickfila on a very small lot when they knew damn well the line would be into the street at lunch time. Not only that, the drive thru blocks parked cars.

- Every single time I go to this Chickfila between 12 and 1 PM Monday through Friday they have 1 person working a register. I expect all 3 of these registers to be manned during this time. Every time I walk in there is a line out the door because the staff is young and not paying attention. I have complained to Chickfila but they do nothing."}
{"text":"Keep me away. I will try to eat every chicken sandwich in this establishment. Fast food heaven."}
{"text":"Great location. Always fresh. Spicy chicken is the best. Love chick fil a."}
{"text":"Its Chick-fil-A.  Whats there not to like.  Great friendly service, clean restaurant, and the best option for fast food IMO.  

Downside is the location.  If traffic is heavy, it can take forever to get into the parking lot."}
{"text":"My pleasure!  Something you NEVER hear, until you walk into this fast-food chain.  The employees are always in a good mood, and treat you with respect.  The store is kept exceptionally clean, and the food is always made piping hot and is equally delicious (well for fast-food standards).  This is definitely one of the best Chick-Fil-A's I've been to."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A puts all other fast food restaurants to shame. And this location proves that. First, the place is spotless and clean. The workers are very friendly and organized. The food is one of the best delicious fast food I've ever tasted. The cookies and cream shake is the best shake in Charlotte. In fact, I will boldly say the BEST SHAKE I'VE EVER TASTED.

I was on a lunch date there and when we finished eating, a older lady worker willingly took our tray full of trash and cleared the table for us. And she had a smile on her face...I thought I was dreaming. I almost slapped myself to make sure I was awake! 

Overall, one of the best, if not the best fast food restaurants in the university area of Charlotte. I recommend taking everyone there, especially those who are visitors in Charlotte.

5 STARS because it deserves it for it's awesome delicious food and incredible customer service. Thank you for hiring the RIGHT people and training them well. C-F-A has integrity and consistency. Which makes a great experience on every visit."}
{"text":"For chicken lovers they have lot of options in burgers.... they should keep some options for vegetarians as well for the meals"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. Manager Edgar was very kind and helpful. I would recommend any of my friends to go and dine in."}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about Chick-fil-A, so I had high expectations.  I got a grilled chicken sandwich and it was soggy and flavorless. 

The food was disappointing, but the staff were nice and the tables were clean."}
{"text":"5 stars!!! The food is always fresh! There's never a crazy wait like at some other locations. &&&& the kids play area is clean! Which is a plus for me and my son. So fast and convenient and the staff is always so happy."}
{"text":"Gave it two stars because it's new and they need to get better.  Ordered on the online app that is supposed to make things fast and easy. Easy order, 4 orders of 4 chicken strips, sauces and 1 lg chocolate milkshake.  Husband went to pick it up. It wasn't ready, employee wasn't sure how to do it.  Manager did apologize and offered fries while waiting.  After the employee read back all the sauces requested, he was handed a bag and left, not thinking he should have to look in it. Got home and no sauces.  The food is good, no complaints there. It will be a while until we try that location again. May stick to the Ross Park Mall store until this one gets it together.  I have no idea why this says San Francisco, it's Pittsburgh and I'm talking about the New store on McKnight Rd."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about this Chick-fil-A location in the overstreet mall.  On one hand, if you are working and need a quick fix for breakfast/lunch/snack or whatever... it's pretty convenient.  But on the other hand, I kind of wish this space was occupied by a small mom & pop place unique to the overstreet mall.

A lot of times I walk by and the line during lunch is ridiculous....probably due to the influx of folks during lunch hour and a shortage of \"fast\" lunch places that are within a reasonable walking radius to his/her office buildings.

All of the above, being said.  The ladies and gentlemen that work behind the counters are super nice and you can see some of them have a good report with the \"regulars.\"  The food is standard Chick-fil-A and its comforting to know it is there when you need it.

There is limited seating if you aren't grabbing lunch on the go, but there are a decent amount of tables and booths in the limited space they have.  The staff always keeps it pretty clean and has fresh flowers in the vases on the tables."}
{"text":"This is a very busy Chick-fil-a location.  The staff was very friendly... seemed really young for some reason.  I think the boy taking my order was about 9 or 10 years old.... it was a little weird, but I think I'm just getting old.

This location also lets your order and gives you a number to put on your table so they bring out the food when it's ready (instead of the usual wait for it to be ready and take it to your own table).  Some of the staff even walks by and takes up people's trays so you don't have to throw away your own trash.

Stonecrest is not my favorite parking area layout... some of the intersections are \"close your eyes and go\" intersections.  In theory the traffic flow looks well planned, but doesn't work with a lot of volume."}
{"text":"This location seemed really new!  The building and parking lot very new compared to it's surroundings, but everything was very clean and the staff super nice.  We did have an unusually long wait for our food, but when it was brought out, it was piping hot and fresh.

Though Chick-fil-a tends to fall on the high end, pricewise when it comes to fast food, it still is a winning combination (in my opinion).  Not many businesses can shut down on Sundays and still survive."}
{"text":"Who would have thought a hospital would be the last place I would have imagined a \"fast food\" eatery would open up business in.  I guess there are worse choices, but it really helps with convenience if you are picking someone up from the hospital and that person is starving.  Just another option - I'm sure the CMC cafeteria is great - but it seems like a lot of the people that work at CMC frequent this spot.  Located on my Mezzanine level (between the 1st and 2nd floors) of the Medical Center Plaza.  Now be careful!  There are multiple medical plazas concentrated in this one area, but luckily there is only one Chick-fil-A in the hospital. 

Since the Chick-fil-A is \"between floors\"  there are low ceilings... no windows, with exception to some windows that look out into the hallway that people pass through.  There are a bunch of tables and a few booths, but mostly people just carry out.

The line seems to form fairly quickly, but the staff is super friendly.  They ran out of lemonade when we ordered so they had to make a new batch.  It wasn't a long wait, but the manager apologized - no harm done.  Despite the line, people were waiting... so I guess that means people really want their Chick-fil-A when they want it!

There is also a Starbucks in the hospital, but I could not tell you where I saw it if my life depended on it.  I was running to make an appointment and I went through 3 or 4 different sky-ways and elevators... luckily I was early so I made it right on time."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a staff are always kind but this location takes it to another level. Also the franchise owner clearly cares about this location and you can see it through out the details even in the landscaping upkeep. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The staff is not friendly...the order took forever...and then I go to use the restroom...and you need a special code...I'm sure this is done as a means to keep the homeless from using the bathroom...it is a sad world that we live in when we deny people the basic rights to use a bathroom...additionally I will say for a company that speaks so highly of their Christian values it's quite hypocritical that you turn around and deny human beings who are struggling to be treated with basic human respect and dignity."}
{"text":"This place is on the way to the Ballpark so its convenient. We're visiting from Germany so waffle fries were a must. We selected a great location. The service was friendly, fast and we even were waited on while sitting down to eat our meals. The management and workers brought us food and mid meal drink refills and other items. I do commend this location!"}
{"text":"I love chick fil a and was so excited when they built this location.  Unfortunately this has to be the worst  chick fil a I've ever been to from a food and customer service experience.  Either the teams are understaffed or not incentivized like other locations.   I hope the owner figures it out bc I live 2 miles away and drive up to the Chandler Ave location bc the service is so poor on Az ave.

Tried this place again and it's really the anti chick fil a.  The staff is unfriendly and lack any urgency.  Food is slow to come out and overall below par for this brand."}
{"text":"Chick-fil-a has made it to Henderson! 1 of 2 locations here in the Valley. This one is on Stephanie and Warm Springs, the other on Eastern. It's only the second day of its opening and it's pretty busy for sure. They've got their full menu. It's clean on the inside and full of tables and a jungle gym for the children. Of course they have their signature sauces (you can ask for whichever ones you want). My ultimate fave is the chick-fil-a sauce of course! They're most known for their chicken sandwich. I got the #1 and the honey got the #2. Their shakes are hand-spun and thick and delicious, and the waffle fries are hands down da bomb! Definitely try it if you haven't before. They have so much to try on their menu."}
{"text":"It's chick fil a. No examination needed
5 stars no questions asked. Employees are very polite"}
{"text":"I'm glad I visited a couple times before I wrote my review. I did wait a couple weeks after opening as the lines were insane. My first experience was not very good which I mostly credit to the brand new employee taking my order. I was never offered any sauce which resulted in a dry chicken sandwich (Now I know better). 

After speaking to some CFA experts I was advised to get the \"deluxe\" sandwich which adds lettuce, tomato and cheese and to get sauce. I did have to wait almost 45 mins in the drive thru so minus one star. 

Getting the #1 deluxe was a huge difference. The addition of lettuce and tomato makes it so much better and not dry. One nice perk here is no extra charge for sauces. So far I have only tried the CFA sauce but it pairs perfectly with the chicken. On all three of my visits I thought the waffle fries were good, but I prefer them more crispy. They just seemed too soft. 

Chick Fil A is a good choice for lunch but Im defiantly not an addict (yet)."}
{"text":"Customer Service wins me over every single time. I won't lie, I was never accustomed to the idea of going to chick-fil-A. I didn't have one in Las Vegas and never really went when I lived in D.C. I just never thought that much of it. Then a few years ago when they made national headlines, I REALLY didn't want to go. So I can't even tell you what me finally go. Peer Pressure maybe. Everyone else kept telling me what I was missing. But I lived without it for 30 years, I could go another 30. Or so I thought.

You walk in the door and they immediately treat you like family. It is the best way I can explain it. All the smiles, the hellos, the how can I help yous, the what can I do attitudes to make this visit the best possible... I thought my first visit was a fluke but wow, it seems like they are like this all the time.

The chicken is not the best ever  but it is good stuff. The sauces are amazing. I absolutely love their chicken soup. And I absolutely love that my son has the option of getting a very nice fruit bowl with his kids meal - not just a bag of apples or whatever. 

I've been converted and this place ain't that bad. In fact, it is pretty awesome. I love this location."}
{"text":"Great salads and always friendly service here. I would not normally review a fast food restaurant but yesterday I watched an employee from the drive through run out after someone with part of their meal that they had forgotten. Pretty nice effort to keep the customer happy."}
{"text":"Finally the grand opening for the Sahara/15 location that is opened to the public. Noticeably more news media coverage at this location compared to the opening of the Chick-fil-A on Eastern. But the parking situation and even the line during the noon hour is very customer friendly (police presence just like the other grand openings, probably every employee is scheduled to work at least part of the day and the line was almost non-existent.

Had I not accidentally left my form of payment in the car, I would have spent under 4 minutes from the time I walked up to the end of the line and getting my order after paying for it. But you know, add the extra two minutes for the extra round trip to the car.

Also they are selling limited edition T-shirts commemorating this event for $15, which I passed up on. Last time I scored a few Chick-fil-A swag, but today they seem to be more tight fisted about it (if there are even any free swag to be passed out). Also menu is recycled/reused for future customers, which is good for the environment and their printing budget for color menu.

Overall, a very nice experience. Also trying their Nuggets for the first time, which is good and lived up to the hype.

Still not a fan of the traffic getting here (off ramp off of a very busy section of the freeway) or the way the parking lot is designed (not their fault).

Anyway, love the quick efficient service and the still brand spanking new look of this very newest Chick-fil-A, and their Nuggets. There's also a possibility that you might be interviewed by one of the local news reporters about this grand opening.  That Asian news reporter is pretty cute and the one in the van applying her makeup for News3 is also an eye candy (even without the full makeup effect). 

Well, this wraps up my brief 4 star review of Chick-fil-A on Sahara. It is the closest one to my abode, so I will likely overlook the seemingly flawed parking lot design and busy intersection it is located by and make future stops here for one of my top two picks in the National Fried Chicken Playoff.

Peace out!"}
{"text":"As far as grand openings go, this one is a smashing success in terms of steady influx of customers and how smooth everything went operationally.

Even with the cops blocking an entrance into the plaza and roping off part of the parking lot and directing traffic for the drive-thru line, everything still went smoothly. No angry customers upset about the expected nominal wait. The staff from the one passing out Chick-fil-A swags (headphones, cows, maybe something else too), to those taking orders while you are still in line outside, to the one that expertly tracks you down like a seasoned counter espionage agent with your order 30 seconds after you paid at the cashier and finally found open seating in the smartly decorated fast casual restaurant... just pleasantly amazing!!!  Even some of the super hyped restaurants by celebrity chefs opening on and off the Strip would be envious of the tight ship that is Las Vegas's very first Chick-fil-A.

Since this is my first Chick-fil-A experience, I tried their Original Chick-fil-A sandwich and upgraded it with American Cheese, Lettuce and Tomato into a Deluxe. I also ordered their Grilled Chicken with Lettuce & Tomato to balance out the experience.  I really enjoyed the juicy fried chicken, the portion was not skimpy either. It was good by itself, but I also tried it with some of their Chick-fil-A Sauce and it was a different kind of yumminess.  Their Polynesian Sauce was pretty good, I am glad I tried it, but without a grilled pineapple to go with it I will pass and try something different in the future.

Come check it out at their location in Henderson on S. Eastern near St Rose Parkway. And if you want to avoid the line of other friendly \"Eat Mor Chikin\" activists you can download their app and update it with your credit card info and place the order and skip the line entirely and head straight to the pick up counter. How sweet is that!!!

There is also a kids play area for the little ones. Totally family friendly, except on Sundays (they are closed, but no one will stop you from lining up to be customer numero uno for Monday).

Chick-fil-A is definitely living up to the hype. I see happy employees smiling and being genuinely friendly, waving at potential guests that drove into the Lowes plaza where it is located in, to the random gentleman that must be an employee that thank me for my visit and to enjoy the rest of my day, to customers equally amazed at how quickly their orders were delivered to their table or the trio that took a day off to be one of the first to enjoy Chick-fil-A fresh in Vegas. Happy faces everywhere, except the poor chap that works at the hot dog cart right outside of Lowes. 

Well, happy eating!!!"}
{"text":"A big thick chewy chicken sandwich with nothing on it always makes me happy. If you're a foodie like me, go here and order a chicken sandwich sans accoutrements and chew on that big nasty in your car. Don't run the a/c and let the sweat drip down to season the delightful treat that was half of the top of a chicken and a squished bun. Not just good; awesome.

Do you like gnats? Gnats are tiny little bugs that might get in your eye whilst you chaw on a sandwich like the one you might get at a place like the chick fil a in Macedonia. And, here's the thing; you will like your squished sandwich anyway and won't even care about the gnats and the sweat and the heat and the cow with a sign who is standing out by Route 82.

You get a pickle slice on the sandwich too which is just fine with me. Iced Tea is too much ice and not enough tea so just go with the sandwich and take it easy or you'll get that breathing quasi-choking thing where you got to get a drink and it glumps the food down your gullet and you can breathe again.

You'll pitch the fries to the bloated sparrows in the parking lot because these fries ain't food nohow fresh or not."}
{"text":"After a hard day of community garage sell
And taking advantage on jcpenny's 30% off sale kept us on the move all day. 

The grilled nuggets is my favorite now with no flour or deep fat elements for lifestyle.  I prefer no sauces thought they many choices.  

My wife enjoys all the others things including crispy and lemonade sugar no ice drink and its refills as the do all the drinks.

It brought back memories of our Atlanta days decades ago where we first enjoyed CfA.

Tonight's staff was friendly and efficient as the order was right the first time.  With entry levels young people preforming, always impressed in these days of uncertainty at best.

Our food was just right as the developer dreamed in the noisy mall food court.

A small business is not easy though I trust that is changing in the current upturn"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service and amazing food! While the drive-thru line is long most of the time I visit they are rather quick and always professional and kind.  They are also generous with the sauces- extra bonus :)"}
{"text":"I love Chick-fil-A BUT this location is not at all like the others. Food is always hit or miss, either the sandwich tastes old or the fries taste old. The subpar food was the only issue until my last visit. The young lady working the drive up was the rudest I have EVER experienced. Literally as I was talking to her she was rolling her eyes!!!! All I wanted was some sauces (that she gave me one of each, 2 sauces in total!!!!!!). 

Management needs to take a closer look at what's going on in the kitchen and who they are hiring!"}
{"text":"Love Chick fil a! It's probably the only fast food restaurant that I frequent at because of the fade AND customer service. I've never left a chick fil a without being satisfied. This one in particular has won me over because they'll add my French vanilla creamer in my coffee before serving it to me and because whether my dog is with me or not they'll give me a treat for my little lucky. Great customer service and great food!"}
{"text":"Chick-fil-A: Chicken, with a side of Bigotry. UGH. 

I LOVE Chick-fil-A's food. That is a sure fact. Their nuggets just blow all other fast-food nuggets out of the water. Hands down. Their sandwiches are good. The frozen lemonade milkshake is ridiculously delicious. 

I have ordered catering from this Chick-fil-A for work several times and it is a HUGE hit at the office. Sandwich platters and large salads and more chicken nuggets than you know to do with.. It's always been a great experience.

But damn it all, WHY must they mix church and chicken?! My only grievance with them is their awful political, religious and philosophical beliefs."}
{"text":"I love chick filet. Period. They have a great menu and are very friendly. However, the last two times I went through the drive thru it took over 15 min when the line wasn't long. There was no apology or acknowledgement of it either. The car in front was at the window for at least 5 min. Meanwhile my shake that I ordered was sitting during this wait. I use the app and preorder sometimes but again the line for Drive thru wasn't long. Very disappointed for not just waiting that long but no offer to remake the shake and no apology.
Update: after the management at Chik filet interacted with me I feel much better about my experience. They truly wanted to correct the issue in order to satisfy the customer. Thanks for caring!!"}
{"text":"I've never received \"bad\" food from chick fil a. Everytime I've ordered something from here the food is A+ but with my drive thru visit yesterday I received the nastiest sandwich ever! I'm so grossed out and the only reason I didn't go back and ask for a replacement was because I had already driven all the way home and opened up the bag then. So unacceptable so I threw it away and just ate the fries. Next time I'll make sure to check my sandwich before I drive home."}
{"text":"This chick fila is the best! During the a.m. shift, the line moves pretty fast. The food is always hot. I usually order the chicken minis combo with an Arnold Palmer to drink, and I have yet to be disappointed. I will continue to frequent this establishment. You are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Recommend: spicy chicken sandwich, chicken strips, fries, grilled chicken nuggets

Cons: the lemonade was way too sweet, even the sugar free version, we had to water it down by a whole lot, also the put so much ice in the drinks, and I don't think there are any refills on any of the drinks- not sure, but it did not seem that refills are being offered

Price is so so- a bit expensive for fast food I guess

Ambience is very nice and clean.
Service was good as well especially for fast food
Overall - I would definitely eat here again, but this is not something I can say I would crave for."}
{"text":"Went to Chick -fil -A drive thru. After the wait I realized they gave me 5 sandwiches instead of 5 boxes of nuggets.
No questions asked, they apologized, gave me 5 boxes n let me keep the sandwiches.
Welcome to this side of town, Chick-Fil-A and thank you!"}
{"text":"I guess you can consider me as a morning regular. Fridays usually the busiest so I just go on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Service with the app is okay but but on some days I still have to wait. The customer service is great and never any complaints with my order. As always there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"This Chick-Fil-A is outstanding! Austin helped me out with my rush order that was very last minute & he made sure my order was exactly how I wanted it & all of the staff greeted me as I walked in the door & made me feel right at home.  I'm always so impressed by how courteous, gracious & respectful the entire staff are. I love me some Chick-Fil-A Rivergate! Thanks Austin!"}
{"text":"Oh no, Chick-Fil-A did not put a new location within a decent driving distance of home. Oh no... Before, the closest Chick-Fil-A was in PV! 

If I have to have fast food, Chick-Fil-A is my favorite. This location's people are as nice as they are at any other location. The menu, however, is missing the cheesecake (boooo). Also, this location is always insanely busy. The planners didn't do a good job designing the traffic flow -- you can easily find yourself out in the lane to exit onto 16th Street, or even all the way back into the Sports Authority/Verizon parking lot. The cool thing is that they bring order takers out to the drive through line to take your order on an iPad, and you never have to bother with the speaker

So bottom line, the food is still great, the service is still great, and I'll still come here. But the property planner needs to find another job."}
{"text":"Love chic-fil-a!  I don't stray far from the basic nuggets- but have had a chicken sand which and I also enjoy the chicken strip salad.   The shakes are really tasty as well!  My whole family likes chic-fil-a, and that is pretty rare -my whole clan to agree on something. Price is what you expect for a fast food place-no dollar menu here though-about $7 for a meal. 

Staff is always very pleasant and you won't get out of there without hearing \"its our pleasure\". 

Drive through is always pretty long at lunch time but moves quick. They do have an indoor play place but my kids are too old so I can't comment on cleanliness-restaurant is always kept neat however.  They are closed on sundays."}
{"text":"So I am not exactly a chick-fil-a fan due to some personal concerns. However, my employees asked for their breakfast for our morning meeting so I must deliver. And I must say that Don does an awesome job. I ordered over 40 sandwiches and hash brown and he was very quick, helpful and made the experience very welcoming. Chick fil a has a way of making you feel like family. Way to go Don and your team! Will definitely use your catering services! Oh and thanks for the plus one and providing me a coffee while I wait!"}
{"text":"Great customer service fast quick the food is amazing just like it was when I was a little girl. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Go here for Catering!  This Restaurant knows how to do it right~ from placing the order to pick-up.  Upon my picking up the order, the Friendly Staff retrieved my items, rang my order quickly and assisted with getting the items to my car.  The Wraps, Mini's & Fruit were all prepared very well & delicious.  The people at this store made pulling a lunch together very easy!  Thank You!"}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-a, if nothing else, is consistently good food. The worst Chick-Fil-A is still worlds better than the best McDonald's. Since I work in the Afton Village shopping center I frequently come here for food. The owners and the entire staff are very friendly and usually always clean. Try to get here before peak times to avoid long wait times in the drive through."}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff is always friendly and smiling.. The one thing I don't care for is having to ask for a refill"}
{"text":"I have been turned off of this place ever since my husband discovered a roach inside the gallon of lemonade he purchased.  I have always enjoyed this chain but will probably not return to this location"}
{"text":"Super friendly service!  Almost bordering on creepy even!  LOL.  Food is hot and delicious, and we almost never have to wait more than a few minutes for our food.  This location does have WiFi.  Another selling point is that most of their sandwiches are less than 400 calories.  It's no health food by any means, but it is a smarter choice when compared to sandwiches from other fast food joints."}
{"text":"I come here every Thursday for lunch with my brother. All the staff knows us and they are quick and efficient. I truly believe they have the fastest drive thru in Arizona."}
{"text":"I venture out of my central Phoenix neighborhood for class once a week at Chandler Gilbert Community College. I stopped for a quick bit. The line was long but they had two fellas working the drive thru to keep it moving. As always quick and nice."}
{"text":"So I caved in and braved the crazy drive thru line to give this place a shot. Haven't had Chik-Fil-A in a LONG time and figured I should try it since it's in the neighborhood. I'm glad I did. It's so delicious, I honestly don't remember it tasting this good the last time I had it. 

Service is quick and very friendly. Despite the scary drive thru, it's very organized and easy to get through. I don't think I've waited for more than 15 minutes (even during peak lunch time). There are multiple employees available to take your order, keep the lanes organized, take your payment, and give you your order. Seriously, there are employees everywhere. 

I keep it simple with the Chik-Fil-A sandwich and waffle fries. I load up on sauces as well. All of them are great. Tried the chocolate chunk cookie, omg it's divine. Definitely my favorite chocolate chip cookie next to Nordstrom's \"Nordie\" cookie. 

Hoping to try the shakes later, but I don't want to test the limits of my waistband!"}
{"text":"Dude, really?  Let's just be honest, this is one of those places that is sought after because they don't have one on every corner.  The first time I visited, I ordered a chicken sandwich combo.  The sandwich was fine, but nothing special.  The fries, however, were terrible.  Who wants soggy waffle fries?  I assumed it was a bad day, and came back weeks later because my wife wanted to eat here.  The fries were the same!  I've had them about 5 times in all, and have stopped ordering combos simply because I can't even stomach them.

My kids like the chicken here, or I wouldn't come back.  Now, I will say, I switched over to the nuggets (or whatever they call the small, round chicken pieces) and the chicken is very good.  I enjoy the breading as well, but the real star of this show are the sauces.  At first, I liked the polynesian, which is sweet and tasty.  But then my wife ordered the honey mustard and my world flipped upside-down.  It tastes like house-made honey mustard salad dressing.  Very great notes and taste.  

That said, it's not enough to ever have me pull in a drive thru window unless my kids want it.  If I order nuggets, I want to crunch on a few fries, too.  I guess you could always go to another drive thru to complete your order."}
{"text":"I love me some chick-fil-a.  Their waffle fries are the bomb and their chicken sandwiches are so delicious and juicy.  I love their Polynesian sauce on top of everything!  I also love their great customer service.  They seem genuinely happy to work there."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Chick-fil-A. I was surprised at how good the food was. On top of that,  the food was ready right after I paid. The employees were also very nice at this location. I had my doubts when I first got there, but am now a fan of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok chicken place in not really a fan but the food is good. And the staff is extra friendly."}
{"text":"Really nice and friendly staff, feels welcoming and it's not my first time here either. Place is always clean and my order is always on point!"}
{"text":"Chick Fila has it right, good service. Good biscuits. Good Tea. and Good Kale Salad. You cannot go wrong with those ingredients. I am definitely a fan. Also, I have been in different meetings in the past few months and when talking about professional service to customers, Chick Fila is one of  the examples."}
{"text":"Food was decent but as always, service was the best in the business.  Delivering your food, picking up your tray after, and the usual pleases and thank yous.  They go a long way in this world and though it isn't my favorite fast food place, I know at worst I will receive friendly customer service."}
{"text":"This is one of the most difficult stores to enter and exit.

It's such a busy location and because of the way it's situated in the corner
of this shopping area...it can be quite dangerous.

Of course when your mission is a gallon of diet lemonade which can only be acquired here....you take on the challenge!"}
{"text":"Rude employee. Bought 6 different meals for my family. Asked for 12 sauces, which would be 2 per person/meal. Sounds fair? Nope. Employee said I could only have 6 sauces but could buy a tub of sauce. Why can't I have 2 sauces per full mean I purchased?? 2 sauces per meal isn't excessive."}
{"text":"This is a five star fast food joint.  

They cook in peanut oil, which makes the food taste MUCH better.  Don't believe me?  Try eating Sonic tater tots after having two bites of Chick-Fil-A anything.  You will never want to eat fried food anywhere else again.

The best part about this place is they are so family-oriented.  They have family nights every week.  They recently had a Daddy-Daughter night which was really well-organized.  They even had questions for each dad to ask his daughter and for each daughter to ask her dad,  They also have a Mother-Son night planned for this month.

The owner of the location really makes a difference in any restaurant.  CFA corporate really chooses franchisees who care.  Then they invest in those people so they can succeed and build their own business.  It is amazing.

The food is delicious.  The business model is awesome.  The employees are wonderful.  Last week the window employee made me smile because she was so joyful and serving with a happy heart.  That smile lasted me a long time and was contagious!

I can't see wanting to eat fast food anywhere else.

P.S. They have these little chicken minis for breakfast that are highly addictive!"}
{"text":"It was late and I was tired from shopping. All I wanted was a spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries to down with a nice bottle of wine we picked up and head back to the hotel room.


Chick-fil-A hit the spot. Thank you for being opened. It was the best spicy chicken sandwich I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Many praises to this establishment and how it keeps the drive thru line flowing during the lunch rush. The reason for 3 stars, well the food is decent and the frozen lemonade is the only thing that really entices me to go back. I think its kewl that they have numerous types of sauces and I've tried all except the picante ones. The chic-fil-A sauce is my favorite but I notice the greasiness of the burger gets in the way and I end up not finishing it sadly. Not even the sauce can help."}
{"text":"I used Chick Fil A as a caterer for a luncheon for my staff and it was great! the food was so nice an fresh, the service was great and everyone really enjoyed it. Very affordable too!!!"}
{"text":"Their chicken sandwiches really are the best. Even though you get this incredibly thick piece of chicken breast, its perfectly juicy and tender. I read somewhere it's due to them being fried in a pressure vat(?). I have no way of knowing buy nevertheless it white meat like you've never had. Also, get their \"Chick-Fil-A\" sauce. It's the perfect blend of ketchup, barbecue, and honey mustard. Once you try it, you'll never want to dip their awesome waffle fries into anything else!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had a terrible experience. On the plus side the staff was very nice and hospitable as usual. The service was very slow I waited almost 30 minutes for my carry out order and went inside. Once my food arrived I had to run to work and had no time to check my food. I went to open my sandwich to find a fully charred bun outside of my chicken. When your chicken is perfectly golden wrapped around s burnt bun it can't be a great sandwich. Definitely not looking to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Seems like a pretty standard Chick-Fil-A. Nothing out of the ordinary. Good fast food at a slightly premium fast food price."}
{"text":"Won't honor coupon :( even when we had had one for each member of our group 
Grrrr Sarah"}
{"text":"Best fast food around hands down. It's ChickFilA, what else could you expect? 
Service is ways top notch and i've never had a complaint. When an issue does arise, the staff is more than happy to help and resolves any issues.
Last I used their mobile app, it was pretty awful but that's not part of reviewing this particular restaurant. Just a side note.

Overall, you can't go wrong here. Enjoy the chicken!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. I love the Egg White Muffin and my Grandson loves the Hash Browns. The employees are some of the friendliest around. The play area is always clean."}
{"text":"Location: great, convenient, clean
Parking lot: private but congested, read markings on road for drive thru
Customer Service: great 
Food: normally great and hot
Price: $6 and up
Community: greatly involved
Out of the three locations nearby, this is my favorite: fast service, fresh and hot food."}
{"text":"Good place to stop by for breakfast. Quick service. I didn't have to wait in a long line."}
{"text":"They have quick and good service. I had been here for many times and I never had any complaints. I like the cookies and cream milk shake and the spicy deluxe. Whenever I want to get some low cost, good quality food, I go here."}
{"text":"My first time here. Seriously don't understand the hype. It's chicken sandwich ! The employee were fine , the managers happy and smiling , but it's just a chicken sandwich! I had the spicey deluxe. The bun was nice and soft , the sauce had flavor , the cheese complimented the chicken breast. AGAIN , it's just a chicken sandwich! 

* Dana , all the awesome contributions Chick fil a makes to the community don't make the food better . Your establishment will flourish for that very reason . Continued success!"}
{"text":"As well run as most Chic Fil A locations are, this one is a huge disappointment. I've given it two chances, and every time it's incredibly slow. It took ten minutes just to order with only two people in line ahead of me, and about the same amount of time to get my one chicken breakfast burrito. It doesn't help the image that as I'm typing this there is a huge line to order, and about 8 employees are all on break at the same time joking around."}
{"text":"What a great Thanksgiving surprise! The clerk just decided on her own to give me a free large soda :-)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and the only fast food I will eat. The employees really seem to care. Food is fresh and have seen them go out of the way to customize orders."}
{"text":"It's unlikely I could give a better review to a fast food restaurant than I could to this outstanding location.  The employees truly seem to care about the guests experience and the food is consistently fresh and high quality. I won't eat at any fast food restaurant but cfa. Bravo."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several chick-fil-a's across the country and this is by far the worst one. The last three times I have eaten there, they have messed up my order. Either shorted me fries or sandwiches. If the others weren't so far away this place would never get my business. Maybe I'll try the app and eliminate the human error."}
{"text":"DO Not go to this location!!!!
Save yourself the time and the Money.... they charge me 2x as much at this location for the same thing as every other chick-fil-a. I usually get their egg & cheese breakfast burrito, in which I'm normally charged $1.97 (2.13 with tax) This location charged me $3.86 (4.16 with tax) for the same exact egg & cheese burrito!!!! When I asked why they were charging me double I was told \"we have to charge you for the chicken even though you're not getting it, because we don't have a button to charge it differently\" (leave it to fast food employees to only be able to push a button & don't know how to over-ride something) But thank you for Confirming that you are In-fact making me pay for the chicken that I'm not even getting. All the other locations seem to have figured it out. About 1.5 miles down the road is a Chick-fil-a off the 101 & raintree, they have the sweetest and friendliest staff, and they will Not charge you for food you are not getting. Totally worth driving an extra 2 min. I will not be going back to be over charged at this location again."}
{"text":"This was the worst one I've been to.. my waffle fries weren't fresh so I brought them back to the counter and very nicely asked for them 2 be replaced with fresh ones..the girl seemed annoyed so she brought back fresh ones and I said thanku very much she ingored me ..didnt even say ur welcome..i think her name was maleeka something like that..i will never go to that location again"}
{"text":"Consistently full of screaming, crying children any given meal hour, and the drive- thru is always wrapped around the building. The food and service is always consistent though, and so I will continue coming back! Just perhaps not the best place for a quiet lunch meeting."}
{"text":"You know what I like about Chick Fil-A? Their chicken sandwiches amongst all the fastfood chains in the world is damn way tooo LEGIT.

BIG CHICKEN BREAST. who wouldn't wanna pick that over a round, sad, gnarly, frozen chicken patty that other chains offer?

I truly love their Spicy Deluxe Chicken Sandwich. Oh. Yummmmmmy.......
And their selection of sauces..... Polynesian sauce on that Spicy Chicken? Heavenly....

OH. Sauces are free by the way. I hate fast food chains that charge for sauces, dressings and dips. that's nonsense.

This location is situated in a busy plaza....however, they have their own little parking...and little drive through.. If you don't want to get out in the heat...

Loved the service here...the staff are friendly and would offer you help (bigger bag, extra sauce, help to carry stuff in the car).. I came with a semi big complicated order...No tomato, no pickle, no both on some......and they got it all right. that's what i like. Clean tables as i noticed while i was waiting, Neat counter, where all the ketchup (in cute little squirt containers), and sauces are at... 

I can't wait till Chick- Fil-A in the Southbay opens with this great kind of staff and awesome kind of service."}
{"text":"Every chik fil a I have ever been to has been fantastic. The best service, the best food.  And, omg, the chik fil a sauce.....   is my favorite.
I always crave it on sundays."}
{"text":"So there was this girl at the register name Ashley. I was indecisive with my order and the entire time she just kept looking frustrated, cross arms and impatient. Chick-fil-A is suppose to be a friendly establishment, I didn't feel like I had a friendly service."}
{"text":"I mean, it's fast food and I don't really understand the hype. No way will I ever be caught lining up in one of these restaurants if it had more than 5 people in front of me. That's just insane! 

Nonetheless, I was impressed by the presentation of the store. It was clean and a bit thought of. I love how they had a condiment section that was fully stocked along with cool looking ketchup. Yep, I'm talking about those squeezable ones in the shape of a stout ketchup bottle. 

The staff is very attentive as they took care of you right away. One incident was when I was in front of the line looking around for help. The rep quickly addressed my needs by refilling my drink and even providing me with a new cup! 

The food clearly real chicken. Not one of those McDonalds chicken nuggets where you questioned its origin. No, this was real chicken. I mean, I'm not sure if they're organic chicken but it was close to what quality is for a fast food restaurant. Now, the question is, are they hormone-free? Probably not. But it's fast food. I mean, how high could your expectations be? 

When it comes to prices, I'm not a fan. It's a bit too high for fast food. Would I come back? I mean.. between your conventional fast food and this place, I would probably choose chik-fil-a."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Chic-fil-A finally opened in Vegas. My husband and I were first introduced to it by a friend a few years back and we just loved it. One location did open up a couple months back in Henderson, but the lines were terrible and my friend had gone to the opening of it and waited 4 hours in the cold to get it. When I heard they opened one closer to my school I just had to try it. The best thing was that they had a whole system worked out in the drive through from taking your order, to checking out, giving you for order, and even a staff member was assigned to give you their specialty sauces. The process was easy and painless to go through the drive through and it only took is less than 10 minutes which was great because I was so scared to wait for 4 hours in the drive thru! Well the food did not disappoint and even the lemonade I tried for the very first time was super delicious. Overall, I love how they have an awesome system going on and their food was great."}
