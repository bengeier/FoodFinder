{"text":"I had a deal voucher for this place and tried the ribs + brisket / pulled pork / pulled chicken sandwiches. My first impression of this place when i walked in was wondering whether I should take this place serious or not since it was a group of highschool kids working there all wearing street clothes, not even in any type of uniform. The ribs were an absolute joke due to the size of a full rack. They were ridiculously tiny, making it seem like a half rack. For a BBQ Smokehouse, the ribs were just decent. The awards they have displayed around their shop seem misleading after seeing and eating their ribs. On the plus side, all 3 of the sandwiches i had were delicious.  They had i believe 8 different types of BBQ sauces to pick from. I just had the recommended signature sauces for each food item and they tasted great. If I were to come back, I'd avoid the ribs for sure and get the sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is a solid BBQ joint. I went there the other day for the first time and had the pulled pork sandwich, traditional style. I judge all BBQ joints by their pulled pork, and theirs is very respectable. Loved the chipotle BBQ sauce (I asked for extra spicy and it had a nice bite - don't know if that was the sauce itself or added heat) and the slaw, which is proper vinegar-based BBQ slaw, not goopy mayonnaise slaw. The owner is also a really nice guy to talk to about BBQ and knows his stuff from cooking at competitions. I hope this place does really well, as it's a nice addition to the neighbourhood. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork, brisket, beans and ribs.  Pulled pork : No smoke flavour, sauced with a sauce that hides flavour instead of accentuating it. No Bark.  Brisket : No smoke flavour, sauced with a sauce that covers the flavour as well, no bark. Odd unfamiliar flavour in the sauce or on the brisket.  Beans taste like canned beans with molasses dumped in them and heated  Ribs were under-cooked so they never released the bone and then covered in sauce and burnt on a grill  Not hating, but I know BBQ. This is not my favourite."}
