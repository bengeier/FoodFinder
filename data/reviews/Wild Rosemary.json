{"text":"My friends and I have been to WR a couple times prior to our most recent visit at the end of December.  We had waited 6 months for our reservation.  This visit, we  booked the latter seating as we felt rushed at our last visit with the first seating.  We were quite disappointed at this recent visit. The food is good, but the portions are small and the prices are high.  Our waitress asked if we would like an arugula salad with our meal (it was free). She then brings out a cereal bowl size of arugula and tells us we have to share.  It was almost funny. It's a lovely little place but there is a high noise level. We observed a couple of empty tables, one large table of 6-8 seats sat empty as did a 2-seater the time we were there. All in all, we were very disappointed and will scratch WR off our lists of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"My experience with Wild Rosmary does not involve eating there..... I have tried several times to make reservations. Usually I get a message that tells you if you are trying to make a reservation call back.  I made a reservation one time, the person taking the reservation hung up on me before she ever took my information. I recently tried to make a reservation again, after waiting to call at the allotted time I was told there were no reservations for the time I wanted, I said okay, let's look at another date.  I was asked if the answering machine was working and was I the person that had just called 3 times.  Yes, that was me, I said.  Then I was told the person with the iPad was busy and I would have to call back and see if she was no longer busy, and maybe she would be able to find a table.  No, she could not call me back, I would just have to keep calling to check to see if she could help me.  From the reviews the food is not worth the rudeness or condescending way I was spoken too.  I know the restaurant has been there for awhile, so they must do something right, but the person I spoke to does not make me ever want to try their food."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp post, or any kind of review, but I was extremely disappointed with my experience. I made a reservation several months in advance to celebrate a promotion, which is causing my girlfriend and I to move to Atlanta in a few weeks. (We will always call Pittsburgh home!). But this was the one restaurant we wanted to hit before our move. The day before the reservation, we were called to change our reservation from 8:30 up to 7 for another customer who \"had to be accommodated for.\" My girlfriend works late, but said we could try to make it there by 7:30. Unfortunately, we were only able to make there by 8, and were told that there would not be room for us. They asked to reschedule us for another slot over a month later, and said I should have not agreed to come earlier if we could not make it. While I agree I do share some of the blame for offering to try to make it there earlier, I thought it very disrespectful to be treated this way."}
{"text":"Both dinner and the experience were outstanding!  

The chef came to our table and discussed our meal. They were very accommodating and gracious."}
{"text":"We finally got in to Wild Rosemary after waiting for 2 months after we made our reservation, that seems to be the normal timeframe for being able to eat there. 
After all the \"hype\" around this place, I have to say that it was a little disappointing. While the food was good, it was not at the level of waiting so long to get in. The true reason for the long waiting time is because the place is so tiny with only 8-10 tables. There are plenty of restaurants in Pittsburgh where the food is better or just as good. We also were not real impressed by the service and definitely felt rushed. If you take their early seating at 6:30, they will hover around the table so that they can turn it for the later seating. All in all, I would not waste my time again on this place. Having eaten in many restaurants all over Pittsburgh, this one is good but not great and definitely not worth a few months wait. Save yourself the high price of eating there and pick a different place."}
{"text":"Maybe it's me but I wasn't impressed.  The interior is charming,but I found the menu to be rather pricey for the portions. I had the scallops and they were just okay  it is  BYOB so that's nice.  I went on a week day and it wasn't crowded, but you will need reservations for the weekend"}
{"text":"Loved it! The menu was excellent- we tried several items in our group. BYOB is a plus too! Great cozy atmosphere and an outdoor space for drinks."}
{"text":"Small, intimate place with a total of 7 tables.  BYOB. Innovative offerings wonderfully done in comfortable portions.  The locals must know something: tough to get a reservation less than 3 weeks out. A great place for the discerning palate and for special occasions."}
{"text":"Wild Rosemart is one of my faves in all of the Pittsburgh and surrounding areas.we make it a monthly must! Always consistently excellent. My favorite dish is the pork chop, but have enjoyed every dish I've had over the years. The whole staff is fantastic! Have brought friends along and they as well loved it! Great food, great service and I forgot to mention the desserts are incredible! A true dining experience! Love it!!"}
{"text":"This is the place of your dreams! The setting couldn't be more surprising--sitting on the side of the road....a tiny little place pops up....looking like a wonderful little cottage. Very magical!   Once you get inside...you know you have arrived to one of the charmingest little places you have ever been.....it's fairy-tale-like.   It's packed with personality and delight.   I am not sure how some place this small can feel so perfect but somehow they make it work.  Reservations are tough to get but it's worth the wait.  It's an experience from start to finish.  The food is inventive and incredible.  The entire experience is mesmerizing.  No need to tell you any more....except make a reservation.  NOW!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations when walking through the door and I definitely was not let down.

It's known that you may have to wait up to 6 months to reserve a spot at Wild Rosemary - and it's obvious as to why after an evening here. It is BYOB so be sure to pick up your favorite bottle of wine.

When you enter the room, and yes it is a small room, you feel as if you are about to sit down to a meal at a friend's house. One aspect that was  evident over the course of the night, was the incredible attention to detail in the surroundings and food preparation. It's can't be by accident that the comfortable ambiance of the room draws you in while the aromas from the kitchen pour into the dining area. 

We were seated by Cathleen, one of the owners, who was very friendly and checked on us throughout the night. Our waitress Leigh was really helpful in walking through the menu and recommending some things. She checked on us frequently and was extremely attentive.

The first teaser was focaccia bread with a red-beet and bacon spread. I'm not a fan of beets, but I could have eaten the spread by the spoonful. For dinner my wife decided to order the Pork Chop while I opted for the Bolognese which was incredible. The  pasta was fluffy and was great with the meat sauce, which was basically veal and hot sausage (yum). My wife loved her pork chop, and I knew why after stealing a bite. 

We finished off dinner with dessert and a French press with coffee from La Prima. In addition to chef Gloria, they have a pastry Chef who did a great job with our desserts. 

Good things do come to those who wait."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Wild Rosemary for our first time last night. We were greeted by one of the owners and seated. The place is small and soooo cozy. The ambience is dark and romantic. The service was impeccable and spot-on. Our appetizer was a tomato and cheese tart, which was out of this world. My wife ordered the scallops, and claimed she has never had better in her life. I had the Chilean sea bass, which I exclaimed to be the greatest meal I have ever eaten. An arugula salad is served with the meal and was amazing. The entr√©e portions are large and the presentation is beautiful. After the meal, the chef came by to greet us and for a bit of chit-chat, which a very nice touch. The owners, as well, checked on our satisfaction from time to time. For dessert, I had a slice of lemon meringue cheesecake which was beyond description, it was so good. My wife had the bailey's irish cream cake, and almost fell out of her chair to roll on the floor and speak in tongues...it was that good!
Needless to say, we went here expecting to be pleasantly surprised, but were actually blown away and made another reservation before we left!
It is BYOB, and that means wine, beer, whatever you choose...they will chill it, serve it, decant it, etc...we brought beer, and it was refrigerated and served as needed with a glass.
Dress code, in my opinion, and from what I saw is dress-casual. I wore nice jeans with a button up shirt and nice shoes. Most men were dressed the same: khaki's/dress pants/nice jeans and a dress shirt, and women dressed in their equivalent.

 Recommendation: call now and make a reservation. FAST!"}
{"text":"Overrated!  I was so excited to go here with the reputation.  It took us 4 months to get a reservation.   I had high expectations.    First, don't wear heels.  The parking lot is gravel.   You will twist an ankle.    Second, if you are not a regular, they make you feel like a second class citizen.    The waitress opened our wine and put it on the table.    I guess pouring it was not included.     The meal itself was disappointing.  $38 for fish.  No sides, no salad.     I am definitely a foodie and price is not an issue but I left feeling like I should stop for ice cream.     As soon as we were done with our meal, they couldn't wait to get us out.    

There are plenty of better places to eat around Pittsburgh.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent as always. That standard as not changed since I started having lunch there as a child. Metaphorically speaking."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! I was in town on business and my associate recommended we go there. I am a CIA grad w/ 20+ years experience as an Executive Chef. This was one of the finest meals I have had. There was attention to detail in every aspect of the restaurant. I loved the \"Crunchy Veal Chop w/ Rocket and Heirloom Tomato Salad\" All 4 of us loved the meal! I even called the restaurant the next evening to thank them for such a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"It does not get better than Wild Rosary in Pittsburgh.  Gloria is an amazing chef.  She creates every menu item and besides making delicious food it is beautifully presented.  The ladies in the front of the restaurant couldn't be more warm and welcoming.  They make you feel like they are waiting for you to arrive in their home to have a wonderful experience.  I had halibut grilled to perfection. My daughter had silver dollar size pasta with mushrooms, cheese and spinach yum.  Not to be skipped is the dessert.  We split a German chocolate cake.  We both said WOW.  delicious. The chocolate the coconut. You will still be feeling warm and fuzzy the next day after experiencing the Wild Rosemary."}
{"text":"Dinner and staff went above and beyond !

I love this Bistro I was there twice, and I decided invited my boyfriend for a romantic dinner, to celebrate his birthday.
How always the food was excellent, my steak was perfect and my boyfriend\"s veal dish delicious, the server very attentive , and the desert OMG its was very unique .
I would recommend Wild Rosemary to anyone looking for a very good dinner in a romantic atmosphere.

{"text":"Cons:
The food is very hit or miss. When you wait months for a reservation, the food better be delicious. 

It's expensive. Chicken prepared in a perfectly ordinary way with pantry staples should certainly not be over $30. Additionally, if you are paying that much for ingredients that are as a whole inexpensive, you'd expect to have a decent portion. Not quite. I had less than 5 bites of the protein I ordered in my meal. This happened each time. Finally, I ordered the pasta dish and that came in a more reasonable portion size. For reference, I'm not expecting gigantic portions or to even take leftovers home. I want to feel reasonably full at the end of my meal (especially when it includes appetizers, soup/salad, an entree, and dessert). 

Also, I'm not quite sure what it is, but I have been to WR 3-4 times. Each and every time I've had a major stomachache within a few hours after eating there. It could be the richness of the food, but I am not certain. I am not the only one to experience this though. 

Pros: 
Very small and secluded with a cozy ambience. There were very few tables and the service was excellent. 

The food did taste pretty good in general. Sometimes there were major let-downs in the preparation of the meat or the sides.  (There were times when it was inconsistent--see above)

The pasta--it was wonderful. Amazing. Expensive, but really quite good. If you want good homemade pasta for a fraction of the price try La Tavola on Mt. Washington. Much better. 

BYOB would certainly be a solid pro."}
{"text":"You have to book way way in advance - but it's worth it! Small selection of meals (menu of ~10 fresh entrees) and the entire restaurant seats only 6 tables. Amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"My trip to Wild Rosemary was such a wonderful experience. Usually it's almost near impossible to get a reservation here, especially on the weekends. We were lucky enough to get a reservation on a Saturday and for 7 people! I was so excited for this. 

Upon arriving to WR, you would never guess that this little restaurant would be home to some of the finest dishes in Pittsburgh. It's delicately placed off of the side of the road and tucked behind some trees. This place looked small from the outside and when I got inside I realized how small it truly is. There's maybe 8 tables which makes it feel so intimate. Once our whole party was there, our waitress came over and immediately brought us ice buckets for our wine. She opened them and made suggestions for an appetizer. We decided on a charcuterie board and then we were given our menus. After looking over the menu, I was torn between the Filet & the Pork tenderloin. When we were about to order, our waitress told us that they only had 2 filets left so I went with the pork. 

We waited about 35 minutes for our food to come out. In the meantime, our waitress kept refilling our wine & making sure our table stayed clear. Once our food arrived I was honestly so shocked with how beautiful it was. The pork was topped with capers and a balsamic marinade, accompanied by homemade ricotta gnocchi. I couldn't WAIT to dive in! 

The meal turned out to be so amazing. The pork was so nice and juicy. The gnocchi were to DIE for. They had a crisp outside but were nice and fluffy inside. 

One thing that really stood out to me in my trip to Wild Rosemary was that after informing our waitress that one our guests was vegetarian (there were no veg options on the menu), she promptly informed Gloria, the cook. Gloria came out and asked our guest what all her diet included and then proceeded to tell her not to worry and that she'll make her something delicious. I thought by her coming out to do that really showed she cared about each one of her guests. 

After dinner was over, we were asked if we wanted any coffee or dessert. I chose the French Pressed Coffee. This coffee was unlike any other. It was so smooth and so fresh. I crave another cup of that coffee. When we were ready to leave, we stopped by the kitchen to thank Gloria for all of her hard work. She gave us all a giant hug and kiss on the cheek and as so grateful for us stopping by. 

I cannot wait for my next trip here. With their changing menu, I'm so excited to try something new! Between their staff, intimate atmosphere, and beyond excellent food, Wild Rosemary definitely earned its 5 stars. One of my favorite restaurants hands down."}
{"text":"I dined here with 4 friends 2 days ago. We called for a reservation in February for the first available Friday evening dinner and it was 6 months later! So, we waited 6 long months to dine at Wild Rosemary and it was SO worth it! First of all, it is lovely and quaint inside and everyone is so friendly, from the wait staff to the 2 owners. It really is like you're having dinner in someone's home. I had the 22oz Porterhouse and it was OUTSTANDING. Perfectly cooked, a nice crusty char on the outside, wonderfully seasoned, tender, with delicious mushrooms and a house made sauce. Really the best steak I've ever had. Treat yourself, make a reservation and eat at this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"I can see how you would like this restaurant if your only other options were big chains like Atria's or Red Robin. The atmosphere here is just beautiful, and the staff is very nice. Unfortunately, the food is insultingly overpriced for the lack of quality ingredients, confusing preparation, and unsophisticated presentation. Our visit was a disappointing string of mouthfuls of raw peppercorns, greasy overcooked mains, and flavorless desserts and sides. Our recommendation? Forget hoping that this will be worth the outrageous prices and just go into the city for one of the many restaurants that offer a similar atmosphere and actually have good food."}
{"text":"Wild Rosemary is by far one of the best restaurants in the city. I've gone 3 times now and I haven't had a bad plate yet. Plus it is BYOB!

The ONLY reason I didn't give Wild Rosemary a 5 star rating is a result of the absurd (almost comical) amount of time it takes to 1) get reservations 2) get seated once there. I guess when you're one of the best (if not the best) you can get away with that kind of stereotypically haughty behavior but come on, 4 months for a reservation!!! That's overkill mate! To be fair, this isn't always the case. I had a reservation recently that only required 2 weeks of waiting. Although  the wait time is a serious gamble, the food is amazing and it is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for Wild Rosemary considering that when calling for a reservation three months in advance, there was only one table available. So for this kind of exclusivity, I hoped for \"blow my mind\" status. I did not quite have the \"exquisite\" experience that the restaurant's slogan advertised, but the experience was still a decent one. 3.5 stars. 

The atmosphere is quite delightful and you certainly feel like you're part of an exclusive club as soon as you enter the place. The decor is definitely very rustic chic and the music makes you feel like you're on vacation, except when you look out the window and see a run-down auto body shop across the street. There are only eight tables in the entire restaurant so the space is tiny but still, you don't feel crammed. Not having a neighbor hear your conversations is almost unheard of anymore so that's a plus.

Onto the food: not bad but not all that great either. Like I said, I was expecting to be blown away but I wasn't. You can tell the technique in food preparation is there so there's no doubt they know what they were doing, but the flavors were rather simple. Maybe that's what they were aiming for considering they're farm to table. Maybe you're suppose to appreciate the ingredients in their pure form. That's great but I can't justify spending that much on something I can make at home. 

Lavash crackers and lemon hummus were served at every table. We ordered the Charcuterie to start. The hubby ordered the Pork Tenderloin and I, the Whole Branzino. Note that the menu changes regularly. So charcuterie is simple and can come off as a rip off anywhere so I won't get into that. The pork tenderloin was prepared perfectly alongside a ball of burrata, topped with honey and fresh berries. Flavor was alright, but not quite complementary. Each component of the dish seemed better suited eaten alone than together in that dish. The whole Branzino was also prepared perfectly. While presentation was impressive, it lacked much flavor. It was served with candied carrots that were decent. We ordered a lemon curd tart for dessert that was the best part of the entire meal. I would definitely come back here just for dessert if the wait for a table didn't extend for so many months. 

Overall, I liked it, but didn't love it. The atmosphere is great but the food is simple, which can come off a little bland. Nothing wrong with that, but it just wasn't my forte especially when the total bill for two people was over $100. I would recommend it for special occasions, but expect simplicity at its best."}
{"text":"From the moment a family member made a dinner reservation here back when there was still frost on the ground, I expected a lot from Wild Rosemary. This is a popular, expensive establishment that only has around seven or eight tables in total. Because of this it books up months in advance - that sets a high expectation and standard for the staff to meet. However, while I certainly didn't think the place was bad by any means, they admittedly didn't quite hit the \"awesome\" mark when I dined here.

To be fair, my biggest problem with my night here was not the food or the service. It was actually the noise. It doesn't take much chatter to turn an itty bitty establishment like this into a noisy room. Unfortunately the staff made the noise levels worse by playing fairly loud music throughout the night, and the result was that I left the eatery with an extremely bad headache that stayed with me long after I got home. We also ended up sitting and waiting for our meal after ordering for quite a while. I think they make everything from scratch and suspect their kitchen is as tiny as the main dining area, which would explain the delay. I wouldn't consider that a dealbreaker given the size and nature of this establishment by any means. 

When the food arrived we all happily dug in, but I personally ended up wishing I'd ordered another dish. I had ordered the corzetti, and while the pasta discs were cooked perfectly and complimented the spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms they came with well, the dish was overly salty. Not just the bites with capers, either - all of it tasted salty to me. My dinner buddies, on the other hand, received a tender rack of lamb and some reeeeeeally delicious scallops that I wish I'd ordered instead - though for the price that we paid, I would have expected to see more food on their plates than what they got. Price-to-portion wise, mine seemed to be the fairest meal. And of course, since it was a special occasion we had to stay for dessert. We all ordered a chocolate and caramel tower cake that was relatively light in texture but full of flavor!

So to be clear, I certainly don't think Wild Rosemary is terrible by any means. At the same time, after hearing such good things about it for months I was a bit disappointed when I left. Some things were great, some things weren't, and taking that into consideration they gave me an a-ok night and meal overall. I may stop in again for another special occasion one day, if I remember to call ahead and book a table months in advance!"}
{"text":"I am confused.  I read the other reviews and all I can say is this place must be hit or miss.  There are many many excellent restaurants in Pittsburgh and this one is ok but not in the top 10.  

If you want to give it a try do not make reservations months in advance.  Call and see if there is a table available.  

I was able to get a table the same day.  I got the 8:30 seating so we did not feel rushed to leave for the next dinner time.  It's really not worth the wait unless you end up loving it. 

The ambience is quaint but dark, cramped & loud.  The food is a bit overpriced.  It was good but by NO means spectacular.  With all the rave reviews & \"hype\" I expected spectacular!

Menu changes every 6 weeks or so.  BYOB  There is a $5.00 cork fee.

We had complementary flat bread with a pea butter spread make sure you get it.  Appetizer we passed on (plate of meats & cheeses).  Shared salad comes with dinner (excellent house dressing).  I ordered Filet Tenderloin of Beef but realized she did not ask how I wanted it cooked.  I called her back she said they never ask they only prepare as medium rare and recommended I not order medium well so I changed my order to the wild caught crab cakes (pic).  Good but not outstanding for $44 I have had better.  My friend ordered the pork chop which was undercooked so it was sent back & exchanged for the crab cakes.  The lemon dessert was good no complaints.  

Service was as it should be.  I may wait for a menu change & give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Wild Rosemary is the culinary gem of the South Hills.  The staff treats patrons as family and the food is executed perfectly.  We celebrated a birthday with 6 at our table and couldn't ask for a better experience.  We brought bottles of white wine and red wine with us, in spirit of their BYOB policy.  The staff was happy to chill the white for us and aerated the red.  

The strong menu highlighted the evening, as each guest ordered a different feature.  All entrees were excellent, however the Meat and Fish dishes were the consensus favorite. I highly recommend Wild Rosemary as the venue for your next intimate celebration."}
{"text":"Yes it's hard to get a reservation and yes it's cramped, but the euphoria of flavors in their exquisite, unique cuisine is worth it.  We had lamb chops that were impossibly melt in the mouth tender paired with a great red from our own cellar.  Couldn't be better!!!"}
{"text":"I'd heard about how good Wild Rosemary was for a long long time. When we finally got the chance to go we jumped at it.  The restaurant was small and dark, the group of four sitting behind us was talking so loudly you'd think they were screaming at each other.  I could not hear my friend sitting a foot away from me, and could barely hear the waitress.  Honestly it was uncomfortable and started the evening off poorly.  The waitress offered us their appetizer plate of charcuterie ($30 for meats and cheeses you can buy at giant eagle, one homemade item of ricotta).  Well after we had ordered the appetizer did she finally ask us if we were ready to order our entree's, only then did she decide to mention they were out of two of the items on the menu, the sea bass and prawns, Which three of us had already decided we were going to get.  For someone who doesn't eat meat that left the scallops or the whole grilled fish.  I chose the scallops and a friend chose the fish.  Waiting until you're asking for someone's order to tell them you're out of two items on such a limited menu is flat out poor service. Once the entree's came, our friend who had been there before asked if there was a salad dish served, as he last time he had received one between the appetizer and the entree.  The waitress said she was just about to ask us if we wanted one.  While our entree plates took up most of the table, it was pretty unwieldy to move everything around to accommodate a small salad plate.  The scallops were listed on the menu as coming with a homemade bucatini, creme fraiche, white wine, wilted arugula, rocket and a number of other half written items.  Arugula and rocket are the same thing, I thought maybe that meant it came with a bit of a salad on top and creme fraiche and white wine sounded like a nice light cream sauce.  It was the heaviest alfredo sauce I've ever seen, there was maybe three pieces of arugula and a bunch of slices of cheese sticking out of it.  In addition to three scallops.  At that point I could only be amused at how awful it all was.  My friends whole fish was pathetic, you could have gotten that fish at a red lobster.  At the end of the meal the check was written up incorrectly and one of my friends went to wait by the car.  The waitress asked if everything was alright and her husband said she was displeased they were out of the dish she wanted.  The waitress came back with the owner(maybe? she was seating people and serving food really no idea) who \"apologized\" for being out of an item in such a way that made it seem like no apology at all.  

It's been a long review and if you got this far great, but if you need a take away, there are literally DOZENS of restaurants in Pittsburgh I'd rather spend my money at for better food at a lesser price. The prices are literally obscene. The food is fine. Wild Rosemary is nothing special, if you want to throw some money away for a halfway decent meal then Wild Rosemary is your place."}
{"text":"Wild Rosemary always exceeds my expectations.  The restaurant has a cozy feel to it with nice ambient lighting.  There are not a lot of tables, which is just fine, but you will need a reservation  months in advance!.  The restaurant is BYOB, which is an added bonus.

The menu is continually changing.  We had reservations just a few weeks ago and then went ago this past week, and while there were some similar items (Veal Chop, Pork Chop), the rest was different.  The menu is not robust in the sense that you have dozens of options to choose from, but it does run the gamut of food.  Seafood, pork, chicken, pasta and steak all make it onto their delicious menu.  All the food is fresh.  This past week I had the \"Worlds Smallest Ham\" and it was spot on perfect.  The better half when with the Lamb Lollies and she absolutely loved them.  Everyone in our party of 7 was extremely pleased and no one went home hungry.

The owners and staff are always friendly, efficient and willing to answer questions.  Definitely make reservations well in advance and give it a try!"}
{"text":"We have excellent food every time.  There is a reason it is reserved months in advance.  Very small place, if you are a \"foodie\" this will become one of your favorites."}
{"text":"If I could give Wild Rosemary more than 5 stars, I would. The food is absolutely delicious. Please trust me, it is worth every bit of the time you have to wait to get a reservation..... a clear indication of how fantastic it is! Chef Gloria makes each and every dish so delectable, you will not be disappointed. Each time I have a reservation, I find myself counting down the days until I am able to return to Wild Rosemary. It's fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 8 (very large for the locale).  We did have to wait about a half hour for our 8PM seating (they do 2 per night), but the staff opened our wine and we took advantage of the outdoor seating area.  This was through no fault of the restaurant, there was just a group who was taking their time closing out their meal (plus, our group had to have a table moved to accommodate).

The grilled scallies were the best I've ever had.  Hands down.  I love quality scallops and these were top notch.  Perfectly cooked, perfect temp, just perfect.  The cream sauce was incredible.  The meatball appetizer (weren't listed, have to ask for what's available) were as good, if not better, than my grandmothers.  The lamb lollies were perfection.  The Duroc chop, perfect.  Everything our table ordered (and we shared), was perfect.  

I've eaten all around Pittsburgh at some quality establishments, but Wild Rosemary may be my favorite.  Gloria, the head chef, came out and chatted with us for a bit, too.  She's awesome.  The staff was super accommodating as well.  You can tell these folks take pride in their restaurant and the food they serve.

Do yourself a favor and book.  It's well worth it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Atmosphere is beautiful and comfortable. Owners made us feel right at home.  If you have not checked out this gem, you need to.  If you can get a reservation...the place is small."}
{"text":"We had to wait six months for our reservation and I was concerned it wouldn't be able to live up to the hype or anticipation. It delivered way above expectation. The place is small and adorable, the service was great and the food even better. I had grilled scallops over Fede pasta with wilted arugula...delicious. 

While we were there we made reservations again...the first available for 8 people is 6 months from now and I can't wait."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to review this because it's a small place and it's kind of a secret, tucked away on Bower Hill road between Scott, Upper St. Clair, and Bridgeville.  Alas, I'm a committed Yelper, and this place deserves every bit of 5 stars.

The food is tremendous.  Wild Rosemary would be successful anywhere.  As Kerry D. mentions, get your reservations weeks ahead.  My mom has been trying to get us in while we are in town for a while now and it's always been booked.

They do not serve alcohol, but it's a BYOB situation. I think they charged us like $10 corkage.  Totally worth it.  Stop by and pick up a great bottle of wine and prepare for a top-notch meal.  

I'll attach photos of our plates.  You can see the care taken in every plate.  At the end of the evening the chef came out and was taking time at every table to introduce herself--a nice touch.

The menu changes, but I think you can check online to see what's offered.

PS: Rocket is a type of arugula salad."}
{"text":"I have been to Wild Rosemary before and their food is very delicious, BUT, we had reservations for a party of 6 for a birthday that was planned MONTHS in advance since that is the norm with the very small restaurant that is so popular. 
 A couple days before the dinner the restaurant called and said they had to move our reservation from January to APRIL because of a private party.  This was on a weekday.. not weekend. Not even a couple weeks later...MONTHS.. 
Needless to say we were all very disappointed and hopefully they will keep the reservation for April. I don't think this is good business when you have dedicated patrons that reserve in advance. 
Thank you."}
{"text":"Eating at Wild Rosemary is like going to your best friend's house for dinner--if your best friend is an amazing cook with impeccable attention to detail. The place is simultaneously magical and cozy with unforgettable meals each time. 

Wild Rosemary seats maybe 7 parties, not including the outside patio in the warmer months. That being said, make sure you understand you'll need to place a reservation several months before the meal. I have gotten lucky a few times on the cancelation list--but that also means eating at 9pm on a Tuesday night (worth it! I swear!)

Wild Rosemary is cozy and intimate, using mostly candles to light the place. I'm not incredibly detail-oriented, but the space has lovely little touches. You can tell there was a lot of thought put into the feeling of the place. It's also BYOB, which is always a win in my book.

The menu changes week by week, and you can usually find it online before you head over. The menu usually has a pork, chicken, fish, pasta, and scallop dish. Typically, I can't help myself and get the homemade pasta. Each dish has a beautiful presentation, but with the warmth of a home-cooked meal.

Before the meal, every table gets a house appetizer, which also varies from week to week. Last visit, we had a warm homemade loaf of focaccia and a rustic Italian spread. 

The dessert menu rotates similar to the food menu. I'm not much of a dessert person, but I'll split one here, with a french press of La Prima to top off the meal.

This is hands down my favorite dining spot in Pittsburgh. Try your hardest to book it for you next special dinner!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a Wednesday evening a couple of weeks ago with my wife for my birthday dinner.  We had been looking to eat at Wild Rosemary for a long time but had never planned ahead far enough to secure reservations.  So this time around about three months in advance of my birthday I called to try and make reservations for a Thursday evening.  Nope, they were booked but they could accommodate us on Wednesday instead and so we went with it.  Once you are inside the restaurant it is pretty easy to see why this place is always packed as there is only seating for 30 people or so.  The restaurant is decorated tastefully although I feel like they packed in almost as many tables as they could since its a smaller place.

For my dinner entree I decided to go with the 20 oz Delmonico which surprisingly came with a side of homemade salt and vinegar potato chips.  Before our entrees came out the server dropped off some bread (I think it was some type of foccacia) that was wrapped in some butchers paper.  Combined with the butter it was really good and by the time our entrees made it to the table it was long gone.  Having only ordered the Delmonico I was worried that I might still be hungry after the meal but once it was delivered to the table I knew that would not be a problem.  The steak itself was really good as it was tender, had a great flavor to it and was cooked perfectly.  The Salt and Vinegar potato chips were good as well although I would have preferred the vinegar part of them to have a bit more punch.  Overall though it was a very good meal and my wife and I were happy that we finally were able to dine here.

The bottom line for me is that I will head to Wild Rosemary again in the future assuming that I remember to make a reservation a couple of months ahead of time.  I loved that this place was BYOB and thought that all the food that we had here was awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and have never left disappointed.  I've visited many great dining establishments in many larger cities and I have to say that at Wild Rosemary the food is consistently delicious and innovative.  Their chef is a true talent.

All the naysayers on Yelp moan about the wait for a reservation, but any well regarded popular restaurant that is tiny (seats only about 25 here) will have a several week wait for reservations, particularly on weekends.  

The building used to be home to an ice cream stand years ago, and the current atmosphere is upscale, yet warm and not stuffy - I'd describe it as it feels like part gourmet restaurant, part your grandmother's basement.  This place is basically a 2 women show with some solid help, and they run first class operation which I hope continues for a really long time."}
{"text":"I hope this review doesn't attract more people because I want to keep this place secret! We have been here twice and both experiences were amazing. Wild Rosemary is the perfect dining experience. Fantastic service, delicious food and an intimate, exclusive atmosphere. The patrons aren't strangers either - you're greeted as an old friend and I think generally people are because they keep coming back. I am vegetarian and both times, though the menu is already predecided, they made exceptions. The price reflects the experience so be prepared!"}
{"text":"What a great little secret this place is.   Food is stupendous and service exceptional.  You do need reservations well in advance since the place is so small. The only downfall is it is really noisy.  Music is played way too loud and we could barely hear one another talk."}
{"text":"Visited Wild Rosemary last evening.  The food and service was outstanding!  I had the fish with orzo and spinach and it was done perfectly.  The only complaint is the seating is very cramped and uncomfortable.   We were a party of 8 and had separate tables of 4.  Small tables are jammed against each other with metal bars underneath (like TV tables) so we had to sit sideways.  Another group was smack up against us and so close the waitress asked me to switch my purse to the other side of the chair so she wouldn't knock it off (which was not a problem) walking through serving.  As a result, the noise level was high and you could barely hear the person talk across the table."}
{"text":"Service and ambiance are spot on here. It takes a while to get a reservation because it's tiny - only 8 tables. So plan ahead. Even though it's small, there's enough space per table to have an intimate, private dinner. The ladies who run this restaurant are great fun, very engaging & they also clearly enjoy what they're doing. 

Our appetizer charcuterie and golden beets were amazing! They set my expectations really high for what was to come. Food is all prepared to order, so your table might expect dishes to arrive a few minutes apart. Start eating and don't wait! The entrees I tasted were all really good and clearly prepped with quality, fresh ingredients. Quite delicious but not mind blowing.  My sea bass was beautifully prepared and the blood oranges (which I thought were grapefruit as I ate it) were a perfect compliment. The tabbouleh at the bottom needed salt and maybe some herbs to give it a punch of flavor. The veal braciole my husband ordered was super tender but was served lukewarm and the pasta it was served over also needed more flavor. Our friend's World's Smallest Ham was the best dish I tasted and I'd give that 5 stars for stellar flavor and creativity. 

Price points run around $40+ for entrees and extra for appetizers and dessert but it's BYOB ($5 corkage), so bonus is you can have amazing wine with dinner.

Overall a really great experience I'd qualify as more of a special occasion spot."}
{"text":"After months and months calling for a reservation, I finally was able to score us a reservation for Friday night at 7pm. It's BYOB so we brought along a bottle of wine. This is a very tiny restaurant with only 8-9 tables. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. We arrived a few mins early and had to wait another 10-15 mins to be seated. The waitress was very nice and explained the features of the menu. I ordered the beef brisket and enjoyed the meal. The meat wasn't as warm as I would normally order but I was so hungry I did t complain. My wife ordered the whole fish, which looked amazing. We split a desert and our bill was $100. The reservation process is a nightmare, so I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of the many things I love about WR is the BYOB.
You get some great some flavored hummus with some tasty extra long pepper crackers.
The food is always well prepared.
The waitress is on the spot when you need them but not intrusive. 
Cathleen always stops by to talk and occasionally Gloria comes out of the kitchen to talk when she has time.
We have been to WR a few times in the last year and have not been disappointed.  A few of the tables in the larger room seem to get more noise from the other tables so it can seem load but we have been in the other room or at a table at the end of the room and the noise level was not load. We started with the Charcuterie that was very good.  The menu does change somewhat each season but there are a few items that are almost always on the menu.
On this visit I had the Beef w.Crabbie Cake, a 8oz filet and 4oz jumbo lump crab with no filling.  It had a trio of sauces, red wine, remoulade and horseradish cream.  Cooked perfectly and one of the better filets and crab cakes.  One wish is that the horseradish cream had just a tad more horseradish, but that is my thing.
Tasted some of the Pork Chop that is grilled and comes with brussels sprouts and some brown sugar bacon chips. It was the perfect chop! So tasty!
We did get a fresh salad with the meal that is good and only partially eaten due to the size of our meals.
The do have a couple of deserts but we never seem to get one due to the fact that the diner plates are large, the hummus and crackers are so good and we had the Charcuterie app."}
{"text":"We went to Wild Rosemary last night for dinner.
It is an interesting experience. Our other couple made a reservation 4 months ago. The food is well prepared and everyone enjoyed their dish. I felt the pricing is $10 too high on every dish! Minimum meal price is 38 up to 49. The dinners do not come with anything and they lead you to believe the appetizers are included. They are not listed on the menu nor is there any discussion of price. Same with the desserts. The server should tell you pricing when she is suggesting the appetizers. There is a $5 \"stem\" fee which I think is crazy. They don't Charge you for your water glass so why should they charge you for a wine glass??? BYOB is because a restaurant does not want to pay for a liquor license.
The customer comes with wine because the restaurant does not serve wine! Charge a $5 per table byob fee and leave it at that.
The decor is iffy, the restaurant is very loud, and the location is questionable.
But that being said. Go visit, the food is good...
But not worth waiting six months to get a reservation."}
{"text":"My wife, Rose, and I feel that this is our favorite restaurant in the greater Pittsburgh area. The food is always perfect and the atmosphere is quaint. The only problem is the long time it takes to secure a table at the Wild Rosemary, but the wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This place is divine! My dad and I are huge foodies and had to try it out after hearing such great things. We were definitely not let down! We had the scallops and lamb, which were both amazing. In addition, the service is wonderful! It's also BYOB, which is pretty clutch. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sorry I think they are overpriced..the atmosphere is noisy !mi got the branzino it was greasy. I've had it at many restaurants in NYC,nj ,dc.
It was priced cheaper at these places and made much better.
Pittsburgh has a new restaurant scene ,places that are priced alittle better    I like to help local business but I won't be back"}
{"text":"I remember when the restaurant first opened. I lived down the street, literally a five minute walk. I even made the ladies a dried floral arrangement when they opened as a way of welcoming them to the neighborhood. Glo and the gals have a great thing going. Food is out of this world delicious and fresh all derived from local ingredients. The changing menu allows for such great variety. I enjoyed being able to pop in for lunch and dinner. The wait list for reservations now can be awhile but it's so worth it. Treat yourself to a meal that's Michelin Star worthy."}
{"text":"Even though we live 2 miles away, we hadn't been here in a while because it's too hard to get a reservation in such a small place.  The food is generally good but the prices are just way out of line.  Entrees range from $37 to $49 and generally come with no starch... higher than Michelin starred places in Chicago!!!. The whole branzino was very good but the yellow fin tuna was good but nothing special. One comment on technique, when serving a whole fish that they list as \"boned\", you need to remove all the dorsal fins prior to serving. The menu only lists entrees and they tell you about the two appetizers available that day.  Don't be fooled to think they're included, which we thought at this price point and the way the menu and service were presented.  They were another $25 for two and they were fairly average.  So the bill with tip for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert with corkage fee was $150.....Way too much.  And honestly, a BYOB place that charges a $5 stem fee per person should actually have nice wine glasses, not stem-less tumblers.  Service was friendly and efficient.
As an aside, I believe Pittsburgh's aspirations to become a foodie destination are a bit overblown.  Yes, we have some really good places (primarily in the east end of town) but many are way overpriced for what you get and at some the food plays second fiddle to the bar scene.  If you think I'm nuts, travel to Chicago, DC, Baltimore, Nashville, or Charleston and experience what Pittsburgh hopes to become."}
{"text":"Truly one of a kind! My favorite restaurant ever!!!!! Every dining experience is better than the next and I feel lucky to be able to eat here multiple times per year. Each time you come it's like you are going to eat at someone's house... you are treated with such love and the dishes are truly all works of art! Almost too pretty to eat (almost!!!). Yes, it is very hard to get a reservation but the wait is well worth it, trust me! This time a member of our party was vegan and Gloria was nice enough to whip up some vegan apps and a vegan dinner for him. He was truly impressed and so thankful! We will see you next month!!!! :)"}
