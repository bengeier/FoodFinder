{"text":"Kerol's Kitchen produced some of the tastiest Malay food I've had outside of Malaysia and having lived there for 2 years...I'm picky. Would absolutely order from Kairul again!"}
{"text":"Kerol prepares authentic and absolutely delicious Malay cuisine.  The mee goreng and beef rendang in particular rivaled some of the better options I've come across in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.  The prices are a steal for the quality and quantity of food he provides.   I couldn't recommend Kerol's business and cooking highly enough."}
{"text":"Kerol's Kitchen is a business run from the home of a friend of ours.  A Malaysian immigrant who moved to Madison with his wife while she worked on her PhD, they had three children and Kerol began cooking meals and hosting events for the Malaysian student population at UW-Madison. The first Malaysian food I ever ate was cooked by Kerol (pronounced Kai-rule), and he is the reason I fell in love with Malaysian food culture.   Kerol cooks meals for the month of Ramadan and delivers to the Muslim students on campus. Realizing the high demand for his excellent dishes, Kerol has expanded and is now providing meals on request year round, all you have to do is text him. Kerol doesn't have a menu, but he can cook any Malaysian dish you ask of him:  Rendang Ayam Percik Chicken curry Nasi  Lemak Beef Murtabak Soto Mee Beehoon Mee goreng Kway Teow Sambal Udang Ketayap Kachang Nasi Goreng Nasi Ayam  And more!!  There are no Malaysian restaurants in Madison, the closest is Bandung Indonesian restaurant, but it's not the same. Every region in Southeast Asia has its own specialties and twists on the same dish.  Malay Tom Yum is not the same as Thai Tom Yum, and Malaysia itself has differing variations and special dishes depending on whether one is north or south, on the peninsula or the island, etc..    If one could choose a national dish for Malaysia it would most certainly be Nasi Lemak: a fragrant coconut rice served with a spicy sambal of anchovy or squid, and chicken curry, as well as pickled veggies, peanuts, and hard boiled eggs. It is traditionally a breakfast dish.  The flavors are intense and explode  on your taste buds. There is spicy, sweet, pungent, and the cooling effect of the veggies.  Everyone makes it a bit different and serves the dish with different sides. Kerol serves his with sambal squid or chicken, your choice.    The most popular dish in the region, and my favorite of all time, is Nasi Ayam (chicken rice). Depending on if you are Chinese or Malay, the chicken will be cooked differently. When Chinese and Indian immigrants were brought to Malaysia by the British they brought with them their culinary traditions. There is also Portuguese influence and all of these cultures mixed with the Malay and indigenous people's food culture and has created one of the most diverse and tasty food scenes in the world.   If you want to know what all the hype is about, google Malaysian food culture and look at the different spices and influences used in the many different dishes, then text or call Kerol and ask him what he's cooking for people that week.   Delivery to the campus area for lunch is free. Usually you will place your order to be delivered the next day, but you can ask him about that when you call. The average charge is $6 per meal.  608-334-6429"}
