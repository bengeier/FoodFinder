{"text":"What a GREAT place. Food is outstanding, SO good. It's a great neighborhood bar that you can comfortably bring the family to. Prices are great and portions are huge & the staff could not be more friendly or attentive. mmmmm where do I start?? The gyros are great, the tzatziki is really good but try it with cucumber ranch -- you'll never go back. I put the cucumber ranch on everything -- they should bottle it, it's SO good. The corned beef is spectacular and the pierogis are amazing. oh the pepperoni rolls and the burgers -- Everything I've ever had is great -- try anything you won't be disappointed. and for a little Papous to take home try a bottle of the Papa Steve's seasoning, it's great I cook with it all the time. Go you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Had the homemade Pastrami Sandwich which was awesome. The meat was tender and spiced awesomely and I even added fried egg on it which was outstanding. Walleye sandwich was so fresh and huge thought Owner might have just caught it. The server who was new was great and very helpful she answered all the questions and even got us to order dessert. Homemade cheesecake was outstanding. If you are in Aurora area this is a must stop by for lunch. Great place to watch sports. The patio is very nice place to sit outside and chill. Do yourself a favor and stop in and see John the owner today."}
{"text":"Best Greek salad anywhere.  Best southwest salad too. Good service.  Friendly people.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Huge array of choices for food, including vegetarian. The grape leaves were the best I've ever had.  Cool atmosphere and fun!  We took our kids with us for dinner and they had great choices for kids too. Lots of vintage signs and history. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"A bit dated decor and occasionally spotty service, but great food at great prices. The owner, John, strives to accommodate all guest's requests, even if not on the menu."}
{"text":"The food and service was pretty good. The theming is very nice and welcoming. The wings were tasty and the pepperoni roll was very good. My only negative is a bit weird. The blue cheese was actually blue! The color is comparable to toothpaste and it tasted like a mushy cucumber. I'm not sure if the gave me the wrong dressing or what but that's kinda scary.

Bathroom review: the bathroom was clean, well lit and surprisingly nice for a bar. I'll give it 2 spooky ghost out of 10"}
{"text":"Meh. Not terrible, but certainly not an experience that made me want to come back again ASAP. Our server was pretty clueless. We asked about different beers and she looked like a total deer in the headlights. Just shrugged her shoulders when we asked what style of beer certain ones were. She didn't even offer to find out for us from the bartender or anyone knowledgeable. It wasn't my favorite atmosphere, but we were there with our infant daughter. Maybe if I was looking to sit at the bar and have a beer and watch a game, it might be a more appropriate place. My burger was yummy, though, so props for decent food."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, it has that dive bar feel in a good way.   My wife and I went here for lunch one day because I was perusing Yelp and saw some pics of pizza they serve...thanks Yelp!

We had two appetizers, the onion rings and the mozzarella sticks both of which were deep fried deliciousness.   The marinara sauce that came with the sticks was delish as was the ranch based sauce that came with the onion rings.

We also ordered the California Veggie Pizza and it was very good.   Loaded with veggies and gooey cheese.   I was very pleasantly surprised by the crust, it was very tasty as well.

Service was very good and the server was great, she saw I was a fish drinking my water so she brought over a pitcher with ice cold water for us.   She was attentive and did a great job as far as I am concerned.

We already decided we'll be back for another pizza at some point in the very near future.   I recommend you try them out!"}
{"text":"We found this using a GPS and we were trying to find something near the Aurora outlet mall, because their food court was just noisy and gross. Papous is not too far from there.  The inside was a little dark and dingy (my elbows sort of stuck to the table).  But the wait staff was very quick to bring us drinks and explain the specials.  We ordered the hand rolled mozzarella sticks, and they were fantastic!  For the main course we split a Greek pizza and it was definitely one of the best Greek pizzas that I have had.  Stringy real cheeses, fresh toppings, and a nice house made crust.  It's definitely a bar first, and a restaurant second.  But don't let the bar atmosphere fool you.  The food is very good!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night, hoping to have a good date experiencing a new restaurant.  This is definitely more bar than grille and I made a royal mistake by bypassing the fireplace area for the windowed, leaky-roofed freezer room that I thought offered up the best view.
  We tried the boneless wings for apps - they were ok but their Inferno sauce didn't live up to its name according to my DH.  Then we ordered the special pastrami sandwich and a corned beef sandwich - excited about them since the sign on the door proclaimed that they had the best.  We apparently ordered the wrong thing as these were probably the worst sandwiches of their kind we've had yet.  The pastrami was flavorless, tough, and chewy.  The corned beef was just flavorless.  The grease/butter used to toast the bread was overwhelming, and I would have preferred the bread not be toasted at all.   We tried to make the sandwiches work but it was like making love and just giving up and going home without a climax.  Very disappointing.
  The waitress suggested we try the cheesecake, which we'd already been planning on, and THAT was delicious (we got it to go).  I would go back for more cheesecake if the environment were less bar and more cozy, but we probably won't be back.  
  This pretty much ruined my night and my heart was broken watching my freezing cold husband miserable - especially mid-sandwich when his drink was empty but the meat was so salty that he was dying of thirst and the waitress was MIA, but then brought him what tasted like pure syrup to drink when she was recovered, and the roof leaked beside me and the surrounding tables suddenly filled with a rambunctious office party... but I guess that's what one gets when one tries to be adventurous."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out after work. They have excellent food and their food specials are cheap and drinks are tasty. The staff is very friendly and this place is definetly a good place to eat or drink."}
{"text":"Local sports bar. Meh service but we've never had anything that wasn't delicious. The Mediterranean Dip is a favorite starter. I'm not sure what's in it but it's addicting! Great burgers and sandwiches. Small outdoor patio for warm nights."}
{"text":"This place rocks..... great food and awesome service.... one of the oldest spots in town here in aurora....."}
{"text":"Very understaffed on a Friday night. Sat in the back in a room that was so cold that I had to wear my coat! Had to flag down a waitress to take our order. Waited 1/2 hour to get our drinks. Food was good though. If you want somewhere that is cold, crappy service and screaming children, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch a sporting event, have a delicious meal, or go out for drinks!  The Mediterranean dip is my favorite, but you really cant go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've never had a bad experience.
The owners John and Frank are Greek, so you know the food quality  will be top notch.  
Although I haven't been there on a weekend at night yet, I've heard that they get a fun, lively crowd with both locals and college students.  Once I move back to Ohio i'll definitely be going more often."}
{"text":"Well, I am hoping what I got was just a one off night of bad food. I ordered the buffalo Chicken Sandwich.... Well, the \"blue cheese\" was just salad dressing and the chicken was grilled breast but a little tuff. The \"hot\" sauce was nothing spicy, not even a little zip or tang. Pure disappointment from that meal.....

 We also got the gyro which was really good (the reason it was 2 stars instead of 1) Will I go back, sure. I never do something just once. Hopefully they will provide a better meal. But I will be ordering something different."}
{"text":"When you walk in, the decor of the restaurant is very..garage chic? In the way that it seems kind of dirty and is composed of objects you were going to throw out but decided against at the last moment. It's very dated, and more of a bar-like environment than anything. 

Inside, there was a bunch of people at the bar on a Sunday afternoon cheering for NASCAR. The service was sub-par. The restaurant is seat-yourself, and it took 10-15 minutes for anyone to give us menus and take our drink orders. Though most people were at the bar, it took our waitress a long time to take our orders and refill our drinks. Although we only had ordered salad between the three of us, the food had taken much longer than it should have. The food was also not very good. The only thing saving our visit was the homemade cheesecake, which was fairly decent. 

In addition, the waitresses were wearing their street clothes, which seemed pretty unprofessional.

Definitely will not be coming back again. 

Unfortunately, we came here on a whim because it seemed to be one of the cheaper restaurants open in Aurora on Sunday. If you are looking for cheap food on Sunday in Aurora, go get stir-fry at Heinens."}
{"text":"good food but LOUSY SERVICE .... check your bill to make sure additional charges arent on there ...also check the amount they put on your credit card, because that's been different too!"}
{"text":"I had been to this plaza 100s of times in my life and never noticed this gem of a dive bar & grill. Good service, food & prices. The Mediterranean Dip is crazy delicious. I wish it was socially acceptable to order it and just eat it with a spoon!"}
{"text":"Incredible food for what appears to be a typical \"sports bar\".  We had the fried pepper jack triangles (crispy, not greasy and the bite from the pepper jack was much preferred over a traditional fried mozzarella).  We also split a fried zucchini (not my thing but everyone else raved about them and the cucumber dressing that came with them). For dinner I had the most meaty, tender baby back ribs I've had in my life! The sauce was thick & savory & they had a deep smoky flavor. I only finished half a rack & I usually devour an entire rack of baby backs with no leftovers!  My wife got the kielbasa, sauerkraut & pierogies & loved it.  Our friends had another rack of ribs & salmon which was very tender & flavorful.  
At a sports bar? Are you kidding?  This is truly a hidden gem! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We dine at Papous at least 10 - 12 times a year and I've only had one meal over the years that I didn't like. The menu has a ton of options that range from typical bar food offerings, to things that are more interesting (spanakopita for example, and it's delicious). On top of that they have a daily specials menu that normally has at least a dozen offerings. The atmosphere is that of a typical sports bar, and the service can be a little clumsy and slow at times. Overall, this a reliable place to have dinner and a drink at reasonable prices. Glad to have Papous in town."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Everything is very high-quality, and great tasting. A ton of great options for almost anything you're in the mood for. The only reason I did not give 5-stars is because the place is very dingy, the atmosphere can be a little trashy (tried to take my parents one Saturday night and was a bit embarrassed by the crowd), it is very expensive, and unfortunately the service is VERY SLOW. The food is worth it, but get ready to wait for it (whether pick-up or dine-in)."}
{"text":"I dig this place. It's obvious why they have positive reviews. The local people are loyal and the food is delicious. Very laid back bar atmosphere, nothing fancy, very accepting. The server was attentive and relaxed, he provided suggestions & opinions which I love. THE BURGERS & PIZZA & GYROS. One of the best places for a burger in the area, they know how to cook it right! The pizza dough was fabulous. Check this chill place out some night for food and drinks, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very dirty place my sister worked there and quit within a week. Known for credit card fraud, waitresses and waiters are very uneducated about the menus and very very slow service"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any of the food options on the menu. Looks a little run down on the inside, needs a renovation but it gives off a dive bar feel. The staff is also great, extremely helpful and seem to enjoy working there and take pride in what they do."}
{"text":"With each meal it continues to get better. Cannot say enough about our continuous joy in the food and the chef's ability to make fantastic meals. The wait staff is right on and prices are on point for the quality of food. Skeptics beware. If you don't mind spending a little extra on superb food as opposed to mediocre food, you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Why isn't this place packed?  Food is off the hook!  Let's talk about typical bar fare, and then jack it up about 1000 percent here.  This place is the real deal.  Very good food at a very good price, with excellent craft beers on tap.  Come on Aurora, support this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Visited here on a Sunday evening with the family. It is located in a small plaza in Aurora. Papous Tap & Grill is a fun, casual dining experience. There is a cool bar area where its seems many locals come to watch sporting events. Mixed crowd of young and old, good for kids. The dining area is large, clean, with plenty of cool decor. Good for groups and service is pretty fast, at least the time we were there.

Menu is big, has a little something for everyone. Nachos, wings, gyros, pizza, subs & wraps and awesome burgers. My wife and I both had burgers and they were tasty. My son had corn dogs and fries and finished the plate. Next time in, we will build our own pizza. They also have healthier choices like soup, seafood, veggies for a sides or large salads. Full bar with draft beer, especially local brews. Mixed drinks and drink specials! 
The service is good. Girl waiting on us came back to the table to check on us a number of times. Type of place were you can have good food and have fun without being afraid to be a bit loud with your group. The 3 of us will be back because we all enjoyed it. Way better then any chain restaurant in the area. Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Great bar and grill to visit. We went for dinner and both the service and food were good. 

We had 5 adults and a child and the server took great care of us. 

We started off with some pita bread pieces with dip, which was good. We also had some fried cheese triangles, also good. 

Three of us had burgers and fries. Great burger, hand formed patty and a nice local bun. You can choose big steak fries or hand cut thin fries. Both were good. 

One of us had pizza, which was a great pan pizza with sun dried tomatoes.  

One of us had an entree salad, which was good. 

We will definitely go back when we are in town."}
{"text":"Tonight was not a good night.  We had the pleasure of breaking in a server in training. We ordered drinks, a pizza and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Our drinks arrived and then We didn't see our waiter for another 20+minutes until he brought our food.  Pizza tasty as always.  Buffalo chicken sandwich was missing the buffalo part of the sandwich.  No heat.  NONE!  I told the waiter in training that the sandwich had no flavor and his response was that he wouldn't think it would have any heat as most people don't like spicy.  It is called a BUFFALO chicken sandwich for a reason.  When I told the waitress, she took it to the kitchen where they put the entire plate (half a chicken sandwich, tomato, lettuce and fries) in the microwave.  Then returned it to me with a cup of hot sauce.  Really?  Then I didn't see the waiter again for another 20+minutes when he brought the check.  Bad night all around for the restaurant.  We have had excellent food and service on multiple occasions.  Tonight was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Went here at 745p for a sandwich. Our service was horrible. We had Kim G and she was awful. She reeked like cigarette smoke, was not friendly and was as slow as molasses in winter !!! We were in there for an hour and a half and had to go find her to ask for the check and boxes !!

Will not return. 

Food wasn't bad, but service was awful"}
{"text":"Consistently a good spot. I love the daily special. We went Thursday and got the 6.00 steak! It was pretty good, a little overcooked, we asked for medium rare it was not red, but pink inside, but not too bad even with that tiny flaw. The cheesecake is homemade and let me just say, it is the best cheesecake I have ever had, including cheesecake IN NEW YORK. The waitstaff are very nice, very attentive, and makes you feel welcome no matter what you order, alcoholic drinks, or not. I feel comfortable going there, its a very nice setting. The bar is in the middle making every spot including the booths a great spot to watch a game."}
{"text":"Great hangout for friends.  Food is good, and the specials always change.  Pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Overall: Good if you have low expectations.  It needs a renovation and menu focus.

Food: 3 stars.  There is a large selection, which is good for variety but nothing really stands out.  The burger was good, but not great.  I ordered on a Sunday and they were out of romaine lettuce, which seems avoidable.  French onion soup is very good.

Price: 3 stars.  A burger ranges from $9-$11, which isn't cheap.  Sandwiches are $11, which isn't cheap.

Service: I ordered carry out, so I can't rate it.

Appearance: 3 stars.  The interior is in a very bad need of a renovation.  It's cramped and dark, and has junk on the walls.  They need to tear out the interior walls to give it more of an open feeling.  The outdoor patio is very nice.  Basically it can't decide if it's a dive bar or upscale bar."}
{"text":"I am giving my review based strictly on our service. Kendra, our server, was inattentive, rude, forgetful and overall acted like we were an inconvenience to her for doing her job. Our drinks were left empty, she couldn't answer simple menu questions and by the time our meals arrived me and my guests were incredibly uncomfortable. 

On the other hand, the food was delicious and arrived quick and hot. If we do decide to return, I will make it a point to request NOT to sit in Kendra's section. Honestly some of the worst customer service I have ever received at a restaurant. Perhaps she needs more training or maybe being a serve just isn't for her, but I hope as a business you address this with her for the sake of your restaurant and other staff members."}
{"text":"This is a friendly place. They have wonderful dinner specials .. They have steak night on Thursdays. Yum! 3.99 for a steak and potato .. They have an every changing beer tap .. So you can try many new kinds of beer. You will love how soon you are greeted by name when you start going there for food or drinks:) Another really cool thing .. On holidays they supply you with the party hats and favors and offer you the special holiday food. It's a good time .. It really is.. We have been there several times a week since we moved to Aurora in December 2010."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving.  This little, \"hole in the wall\" has outstanding food, great bartenders, and an awesome beer menu!  Johnny, the owner, is always adding great specials"}
{"text":"Ordered the Greek Style pizza to go. It was the BEST pizza I have ever eaten. Like bow down to the chef quality. Where have you been all my life?!"}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews as we are from west side. I think they were understaffed that day maybe but when we walked in no one acknowledged we were there - bar tenders totally ignored us - looked like mostly regulars at bar. When we finally got seated our waiter took forever to take our order, didn't know the wi-fi code (even though it says free Wi-Fi all over menus) and it took forever for our food to come back. The menu items are random and food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"You know what?  I can dig this place.  

I can see why some people might not.  The decor is bar decor.  The staff is both young and old, and it can be hit or miss. But what you get is a nice, low key neighborhood bar that serves cold beer and food that ranges from \"homemade deliciousness\" to \"just drop it in the fryer\".  I can testify that I saw the owner smoking or cooking outside the bar.  They take pride in what they do.  It's also a big place, though the bar is usually especially crowded."}
{"text":"Back again and delicious lunch again. Friendly staff and good menu selection. Cucumber ranch is fantastic"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood location. The food is always solid. Especially love the soups, buffalo cauliflower, and daily specials. Drink selections are decent and they typically have a few good craft drafts. Winter time we enjoy finding a table near the fireplace, and summer time on the patio."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fun and friendly staff. Nice crowds :) great HUGE bar. Tons of seating. Plenty of TVs for viewing sports. All around nice neighborhood restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"Went with friends tonight to watch NCAA basketball tourney games.  We arrived at tip off and found none of the TV's tuned to hoops.  Over the next 30 minutes we drank a beer and repeatedly asked our waiter to have at least one TV changed.  Time and again we were told the staff was too busy to assist.  This will be our last visit to Papous."}
{"text":"Went to this place today ( Papous tap & grill). 3/17/17. Ordered 2 CORNED BEEF DINNERS.  PLACE WAS BUSY. SERVER SAID \"ill bring THEM out as soon as they're ready\"! Took 2 minutes & they were out. DIDNT CHECK BAG !!!!! Ordered an O'Doules   ( I don't drink alcohol )  just to 'kinda join the fun atmosphere, paid my bill of $38.00 +tip, & went home. 3:15pm. 6:30. Time for DINNER. No dinners. Sandwiches. Called restaurant. THEY COULDNT HEAR ME, I COULDNT HEAR THEM. Suggested I call later. Or tomorrow \"! Well. I'm going to TRY TO CALL THEM. PAPER STAPLED TO BAG SAID DINNERS. I guess they can't tell the difference either. Well needless to say I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. Haven't been there for a few years but thought I'd give it another chance. Was there last month & it was very good. New owners   Ok \"MR owner\". What are you going to do about this mistake? Barbara Perk. From Aurora. Email.   Retiredbartender@gmail.com."}
