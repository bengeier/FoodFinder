{"text":"You say \"fried potatoes\" and I'm interested! While I've not been to Belgium, I do consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to fries, frites, and chips, and I've got to say these are different from any I've had here in town.  Thick-cut, almost meaty, skin on frites tossed in seasoned salt, served hot and fresh. Could it get better? Add some \"game day garlic\" sauce or malt vinegar, and yes, it can. I loved the garlic sauce-- thick and flavorful. Also tried the beer cheese dip made with PBR, served warm, which was good. You could really taste the beer!  My friend and I thought picking up an order of frites would be a good side to our lunch, but really they could be a meal in themselves.  The atmosphere is nice and clean. The tables have holes for you to set your paper frite cone in, which is awesome. And they're working on implementing an automated ordering system which is pretty cool.  We met the owner (and her mom) and they were both so very nice! I am excited to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm mad for Mad City Frites! If you're on Madison's State Street and hungry for a quick snack, this place is a must stop. Fun atmosphere, friendly employees, and great fries."}
{"text":"I KNOW I wrote a review of Mad City Frites a couple of weeks ago.  It's disappeared for some reason.  I'm in a writin' mood, so here goes another.  Interior was spacious, clean and bright, with fun holes in each table for the paper fry-cone holder to sit in.  The lone woman on duty was very nice, and rather excited to bestow the frites upon us!  I take that as a sign of a new business populated by energetic young folk.  Oh, to be in the flower of youth again!  The frites were nice and crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside, with a sprinkle of season salt to spice them up a bit.  We ended up getting three of the dipping sauces: the garlic, the honey-mustard, and the mad sauce.  The garlic was not super flavorful.  It helped to glob the sauce on each bite.  Perhaps more of this sauce is required to accommodate such globbing.  The other two were much better.  The honey-mustard was nice and tangy-sweet (HM is one of my fave combos), and the Mad sauce was really good too.  It's been a few weeks, so I can't remember what was in it exactly, but it was very flavorful, kind of like sweet pepper maybe?  AGHH my memory!  Anyway, I enjoyed these two sauces a lot.  Several reviewers have dinged this place because the frites are \"too thick.\"  I wasn't aware that there were standard specs for this kind of fry.  I LIKE thick-cut fries, and this joint does them well as descibed above.  But then, I also like steak fries, so I guess that makes me, what, a philistine?  Probably!  I guess these sort of one-item menu concepts are au courant.  This one makes a lot of sense for a snack mid-afternoon, as I had.  They are open super-late on weekends, so the other obvious time is after-bar for State Street drunkies.  Whatever floats your boat.  I would go again, and probably will soon as I have been having cravings for fries this week and I have to go downtown every day.  Kinda inevitable!  I've never been to Belgium, so I can't speak to how \"authentic\" they are ( I find this term used as a criticism of restaurants to be tendentious and tiresome anyway) but I can say the frites are plenty tasty and satisfying, the portions are good for one, or to share with a friend (unless you're a fat-ass) and the sauces I've had are a nice tasty addition."}
{"text":"They are located right in the middle of State St. They are open late. They serve thick hand cut fries and poutine. Need I say more?  A small order of the fries comes with choice of one sauce while the large version comes with two. Of course you can always ask for additional sauce for an extra charge. For me the small is perfect, sometimes it might even be too much, depending on how hungry I am.  My favorite sauce is the madtown mango, mango chutney aioli with garlic and lemon. There's a reason why this sauce is the first one on their list, number 1. Poutine is also great, made with Wisconsin cheddar and gravy *yum yum*  For those looking to spend the afternoon or a couple hours with friends munching on fries, there are plenty of games in store to keep you occupied."}
{"text":"Awesome thick cut fries with variety of sauces. Have been there thrice in the last one month and each time, we have been happy with the quality of fries and service."}
{"text":"Be noted: this place ONLY serves French fries. Now that that is out of the way, I really liked it! The dips are nice, garlic aioli is my favorite. I didn't know there were so many ways to make fries!   My friends and I each got a different type and shared, it was a fun easy snack that we enjoyed while sitting in their out door seating area while people watching."}
{"text":"FRITES ON POINT.   GENERAL: Great flavor, check the specials card for even more sauce variety, order 'em how you like 'em (extra crispy for me), check apps for frequent coupons/deals/steals!  I love love LOVE fried potatoes of any kind. These ones are delicious. Once you order, your frites are made fresh, which is always an added bonus.  FLAVOR: the seasoning is BOMB--a great combination of salty, tangy, smoky, garlicky, and every other delicious flavor you can imagine. There are maybe 10-15 sauces that you can choose from, and while I've enjoyed every one that I've had, the biggest standout for me is the sconnie sriracha. PRO TIP: don't get 100% set on your sauce decision based on the menu board; there are monthly specials on cards located up at the register. My favorite sauce so far has been the Roasted Red Pepper Aioli, which was a special sauce for this month.   TEXTURE: texture hasn't always been totally consistent for me here--sometimes I get a crisper order, sometimes I get a softer one, but every time, there are a handful of really crisp little guys that are my favorite. Don't be afraid to tell them what you like! I've learned that they key is to order them extra crispy or \"well-done\" so that I get all of my frites just the way that I like em!   PRICING: They definitely need to change this up--how? I'm not sure, but it doesn't make THAT much sense the way they have it now. They're not overpriced by any means, but it is a bit strange. The regular size is priced at $4.50, and it comes with one sauce. Large is $5.50 and comes with two sauces. Additional sauces can be purchased for $1.00 a piece or $2.50 for a combo of three sauces. If you're a sauce lover like me, you'll need an extra sauce no matter which size you go with...and while I'm not a fan of wasting food, at times it seems like it might be most cost-effective to just upgrade to the large for the extra \"free\" sauce and then get rid of whatever frites I don't eat. There are generally coupons on apps like Hooked that will get you a discount of some sort though, so that comes in handy for me a lot.  STAFF: The staff here is phenomenal. They are happy to answer questions and they're always polite, upbeat, and happy. I've seen them when I'm sober and I've seen them while I'm on the verge of blacking out, and they've always been kind and helpful.   ATMOSPHERE: Urban chic, with specialty tables that have holes to insert your fry-cones into! It's a great place to stop in off of state street. You can hang out with friends and play a board game from their selection, sit by the window and people-watch, or just chill out and enjoy your frites!  5 stars! I hope this place sticks around for a long time!!!"}
{"text":"Mad City Frites takes fries to a whole new level.  I went with a friend and got a Large sized frites with the number 1 and number 2 sauces, and it was SUPER filling (granted, we went AFTER we ate dinner haha).  I love that their sauces have so much flavor, and that their fries aren't just \"crisps\".  I'm a huge fan of huge potatoey fries so I absolutely loved Mad City's fries.  All their sauces are really good so you really can't go wrong.  Their Mango sauce is slightly sweet, and while mango and fries don't sound like they go together, they actually do.  The garlic is very garlicy and not too salty, and again tastes great.  One tip though, if you get a large, BRING A FRIEND TO EAT IT WITH.  It is definitely a lot of fries.  My only caveat with this place is that two sauces isn't enough for 1 large sized fries (especially if you really like sauces)."}
{"text":"When it comes to frites, this is pretty fantastic.  My husband and I stopped here after doing some Christmas shopping on State St.  It was pretty empty when we got there around 1:15 PM.  We ordered a large frites with the #4 (queso) and #9 sauces.  Our frites came out piping hot pretty quickly.  I thought they were cooked well, seasoned well and the sauces were excellent.  There was just enough of the sauce to finish out the frites.  The portion size was great and the price was proportionate to the amount of frites we got.  Filled us up so much, we decided that was lunch! I'd definitely come here again to try out more of the sauces."}
{"text":"My wife and I each ordered a regular size with an extra dipping sauce. This turned out to be more food then I thought, almost enough for a full meal.  The fries were seasoned very well with seasoned salt and came out in just a few minutes. Most of the fries were well cooked but there was an undercooked one or two in my cone. I had the mango and the teriyaki sauces. Both of the sauces were thick white sauces. They both tasted good, but they didn't taste like mango or teriyaki. My wife and I couldn't even agree which was which. The sauces were labeled on top and the one label appeared smudged. I'm curious if we possible got one wrong sauce.  The two sauces my wife got were better, but I don't remember what they were.  The decor was simple, but nice. The tables with the custom holes for your fries are fun and I always enjoy window seating on State, which there is plenty of.   It's worth the trip and something refreshingly new to town."}
{"text":"Every time we go here we load up on sauces. If you have a friend, split a large frite, and double down on the sauces. Grateful Red pepper aioli is the best. It's my favorite. We also get Game day Garlic, Mad Sauce, and a few from Sauce of the week (can't remember off hand though) If I'm going to get take out, I usually like to get a whole meal, but when I'm craving fries, I'm going to Mad City frites. They're also on the Hooked App so you're also able to get a deal if they post it. Nothing like good food with a discount."}
{"text":"Frites is on.   What can you get? Thick cut double fried fries. With sauces to choose from.  The venue was clean and spacious and I loved the cut out holes in the table so we can put our fries and sauces.   I wasn't very impressed by the mad sauce but I was pleasantly surprised by how good the fries were, despite being really thick. There was a nice crisp on the outside, and lots of flesh in the inside but yet was not too dense.   Poutine was not to my liking. Why isn't the cheese curds more melty... And the sauce was too salty with the fries. Need to adjust the amount of salt.  As for variety.. How about some curly fries? Waffle fries? Potato chip? Thin cut frites?   And I just really want aioli to go with my frites. Thank you very much.   Verdict: Try it! Great place for snack, but I wish there was more variety on the menu."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Mad City Frites, but I was a little disappointed. The dipping sauces were  good, the seasoning on the frites are great, but they are missing that critical \"crunch\" that is the hallmark of a European Frite. It says they are double fried, but I am skeptical. If they are, they need to work on technique. Traditional Frites are double fried with puffy soft potato on the inside and the outside has a distinctive crunch. This is missing from Mad City Frites. I hope that they can master that crisp crunchy frites need.  Prices are good. In fact, the 'Large' for only $5.50 is a steal."}
{"text":"If you're craving French fries and like sauce options then come to Mad City Frites. They're some decent quality fries and have a nice quiet atmosphere. There are some party games on a shelf which we made use of and it sends like a good environment to bring your own game and friends to. Maybe make this a stop on your walk down State Street and get some small food items from other restaurants too, like a bar hop for food!"}
{"text":"Frites, that's what they do. Good variety of sauces. Fries are a little on the salty side."}
{"text":"I was craving fries and this was the right spot. The fries were little thicker than my liking. I got sriracha and the sauce was yum. We also got poutine. It's not the best I have ever had but it was pretty decent. Will visit again."}
{"text":"The best fries I've ever had. Seriously. And love the variety of dipping sauces. The sirracha lime was my favorite. However, while the fries in the poutine were excellent and the gravy was good, the cheese curds were disappointing. I have eaten poutine in Quebec, where it originated, and the curds are always melted. Or, this being Wisconsin, you would at least expect the curds to be fresh and squeaky. But no, at Mad City Frites, the curds were really cold. Very disappointing. Still, I'd go back just for the amazingly good fries. But please, warm up the curds."}
{"text":"We stopped here because my daughter loves french fries and she was on vacation too.  I love this idea and concept of business and was so happy to see it doing well.  The fries had season salt on them and were very addictive.  I wasn't a big fan of the sauces but both my kid and husband love them.  I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here one day mid morning to check it out.  We were the only people in the place and had our choice of tables. The interior is very urban industrial and I love that there are little spaces in each table to hold the fries.  After we ordered, we watched the employee grab the potatoes and cut them fresh right in front of us. I love this - they are truly made to order and are not a bunch of precut frozen fries that they make up.  I am not a fry person by nature. I never order them when I am out, and if they happen to come with the meal, I rarely eat them. However, I was super impressed by these fries. They were nice and thick and fried perfectly.  They weren't overly greasy or soggy, nor were they hard and crunchy. I liked them a lot.  We chose the \"Campus Queso\" and the \"Game Day Garlic\" sauces. The cheese looked totally not special, but it actually had a strong (though not too strong) beer taste to the cheese. It went well with the fries. I was more a fan of the garlic, which was creamy and garlicky (obviously) and just...better.  My friend and I shared a large, which was more than enough food for both of us.  And $5.50 for the fries and two sauces? Maybe I'm still thinking in terms of Chicagoland pricing, but that seemed pretty darn reasonable to me. I realize that this is a very limited menu, but personally, I think that's okay. You go to Mad City Frites for fries and you get...fries. Good ones. :) I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Best fries I've had in a while!! What a wonderful concept. The sauces were flavorful, the fries were big and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the service was great. I will definitely be back! (Just asking for more open hours!!!)"}
{"text":"Impressions: solid fry seasoning, not quite frites IMO. Probably works best as a post-bartime snack stop. They're fast and greasy and have a lot of open space in the shop.   I really wanted to love this place because I LOVE fried potatoes! However, the general lack of options, too-thick cut fries, and lackluster dips meant this fell short of my expectations. Dips I tried: garlic and pesto ones. I forget the clever names they had, but I ended up preferring the ketchup."}
{"text":"Excellent poutine!  I tried poutine twice while in Madison, and Mad City's is the closest to the poutine served in Quebec.  Mad City's thicker-cut fries held up beautifully to the delicious gravy, yet they weren't so thick that they were a distraction.  Perfection."}
{"text":"Such a great place! The fries are amazing and the staff is very friendly. The inside of the restaurant is super cute and soon they will have self ordering iPad stations. I loved the sriracha lime sauce the best! These were the best fries I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"We took our two kids (5.5 & 3) here for a snack on a weekend afternoon in late October.  The ladies working when we went were very nice to the kids (came out and gave them stickers), and us as well.    The fries were thick and nice and crispy.   There were a lot of smaller bits of fries in the large order I got to share with the kids, which was really my only complaint.  I ordered the 'Big 10 Buffalo\" and \"Madtown Mango\" sauces.  Both were good but I preferred the mango sauce.  A large order comes with two sauces, which seems like it is enough, though the kids probably ate 1/2 of my larger order and they used copious amounts of ketchup.    My husband ordered the poutine and said it was great.  I had a taste, but it's not really my thing.  He guarantees me that if you like poutine, you'll like theirs.     I wouldn't treat this as a meal place but for a snack or bar food it seems pretty good.  We would go there again."}
{"text":"Cute and simple storefront/dining area, and unique food.  I suppose you could get plain fries with ketchup, but that's a waste.  Tried the poutine, which is one of the few or only places in Madison to get it, and it was delicious.  Totally trying the cheese and PBR sauce next time."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard this place was coming to Madison--but alas it ended up being a disappointment. I was hoping it would be just like Pomme Frites in Manhattan, which I make devoted pilgrimages to every time I'm in New York. Unfortunately, the Mad City version falls far short with fries that are too thick, not quite crispy, and sauces severely lacking in flavor. The roasted garlic sauce barely tasted like garlic.  I would rather go a couple doors down and get bubble tea as my State Street snack."}
{"text":"My thoughts on Mad City Frites are pretty similar to what Shruti W. said in her review. The layout is spacious, the ambience is nice, but the frites themselves are lacking. I also felt like they were too thick, and were way too soft than I wanted them to be. I kept hoping to get some crunch in a few of them, but it never happened. Also, while the sauce texture is there, the flavor is not whatsoever. My group ended up getting 4 sauces, and we could not tell the difference between any of them except for the honey mustard. Way too mild of flavor for a sauce that's really thick.  In addition, I feel like the pricing system here needs some improvement. There's two sizes: regular for $4.50, which comes with 1 sauce, and large for $5.50, which comes with two sauces. And then you can get another sauce for $1 (or 3 for $2.50). The large is likely going to be too much for one person to eat (I have a large appetite and finished a large, but my stomach didn't feel great in the end), but getting just 1 sauce is lame (especially with how flavorless they are). So you want to get at least 2. But you feel like you're getting ripped off if you just buy the1 sauce, because you should just get the large then. But if you get the large, then you're going to feel sick/bloated/greasy/fat after you eat it from eating too many fries.  Overall, change the price of extra sauce to 50 cents, because 1) Other places don't charge nearly that much for more sauce (See below), and 2) It would give people incentive to actually get more sauces and not more starch.  And in case you're reading this review because you were searching for places with good fries, here are 3 places that do fries/frites in Madison way better than this place: Jac's on Monroe Street: You can get a frites basket that has crispier frites, and is the size of MCF's large, for $5, and that comes with an aioli. If you add $1 (the price of 1 sauce at MCF), you get 3 extra sauces, all of which are very tasty. So you can spend $6 at Jac's or $7.50 at MCF for frites and 4 sauces. Easy call to me! Tipsy Cow on the corner of King/Main: They have a good selection of specialty baskets of fries, ranging from $7-$9. So it's more expensive, but it's meant for sharing, and therefore you get more. Options includes buffalo blue cheese, truffle, carnitas, and many others. DLUX on MLK Blvd: If you're on more a budget, you can get speciality fries for $3 here for 1, or a basket for $6. Similar to Tipsy Cow, they have Truffle, but they also have sweet potato w/ Sriracha Mayo, a real goodie.  So there you go. In addition, you can get things other than fries at those places, like alcohol and entrees. I would give Mad City Frites a 2.5, but i'm rounding down here because frites are the only thing they do, and I wouldn't put them in the top 5 for Fries in the city, so why I would ever go here?"}
{"text":"So delicious! The frites were thick cut, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and piping HOT! The saracha sauce was amazing! They need to bottle that so that I can put it on everything! It is mild but flavorful, not overly spicy. We also tried the garlic lime sauce. It was thick with a mild garlic flavor and the bright touch of lime. Also good, but that saracha sauce... OH MY!  This was my first time trying poutine, so I don't have anything to compare but it was spectacular. Rich gravy and soft cheese curds. It was salty so I can't wait for them to have some beer to pair it with.  Service was quick and they came to check on us twice. Exceptional service, food, and attention to detail. In fact, I think one of my favorite parts, besides the food, were the holes cut into the tables so that you can place your cone of frites upright.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love a place with a small menu that they do well.  And this place nails it.  Fries were great, as were the dipping sauces.  We also ordered poutine which was on point.  Will definitely be stopping back."}
{"text":"The fact that I live around the corner from this place is highly dangerous. So delicious! My favorite sauce is the game day garlic, although the mad city sauce and the beer cheese sauce are delicious and worth a try as well. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, unlike any fries I've had!"}
{"text":"This might be a bit snobby, but after spending some time in Belgium last year, I was excited to hear that Madison was getting a Belgian frites place- I could relive my time wandering around eating delicious frites! Mad City Frites, however, did not live up to my expectations. The frites weren't terrible, just nothing special. I went with a group of friends, so we were able to try each others' sauce choices, and these were also good, but nothing exceptional.  I do like the handy holes in the tables for the cones of frites. They also have a pile of board games, which is a fun idea.  I really wanted to love this place, but it fell a little short of my expectations."}
{"text":"If you are only going to do one thing in your restaurant, you better do it right.  In the case of Mad City Frites, I was expecting more and got less.  I thought the fries themselves were perfectly cooked-crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside.  Complaint #1-Why put seasoning salt on the fries?  They change the flavor and clashes with the sauces.  Simple salt works just fine.  Complaint #2-The sauces didn't hit the mark.  With a small order, you get a choice on one sauce.  With a large, you get 2.  So, of course, we opted for the large. With the choice of 10 sauces, we opted for the Game Day Garlic and Sconnie Sriracha.  The game day garlic was light on the garlic and heavy on the lemon.  The sriracha sauce was spicy but didn't real bring anything else to the table.  I was also surprised they didn't just offer a simple aioli.  Remember guys, sometimes less is more. I was pleased to see they will be bringing wine and beer to the menu as I think this will be received well. Sober, I probably won't be back.  After few beers and without any other options available, well then, all bets are off!"}
{"text":"Went here a little before bar time. Services takes a minute but because they make everything fresh for you, which makes it totally worth it. We got the garlic and Mad City sauces. I recommend both highly. Can't wait to go back and try others. I love it for late night food, but not sure when else i would want to go and just get fries."}
{"text":"Great Friday night spot for me and my three year old daughter :-)  Mango sauce was delicious and frites had just the right amount of seasoning.  Very friendly service.  Lots of tables since they didn't have beer and wine available which is a must on State Street but in the mean time good time to try it before the outdoor seating gets sparse."}
{"text":"Oooooh yes, this is one of the good ones. IMO, the State Street area has always been kind of lacking in non-food cart, non-sit down/dine in snack places. There are some, and it's expanding, but not much else as you move toward the Square.  Enter Mad City Frites. As others have said, they only do one thing - but they do it well. If you're looking for hot, perfectly textured fries with delicious dipping sauce or some good poutine, get here. Plus, cool design stuff: the tables have little holes in them for the fry cones!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven. Sometimes I wonder if the business opened just for my indulgence. The fries are outstanding and filling for a decent price (especially if you go with the promos on the Hooked smartphone app!). Lots of variety with the sauces so you'll always have something new to try. I've yet to order the poutine, but being a Canadaphile with high standards in that department, it will sure be an experience I won't forget when I do finally order it. Hopefully, the cheese curds will be melted in with the fries and gravy. Regardless, this establishment would receive 10 stars from me if it were possible. Yay for small businesses with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Really perfect frites. Perfectly salted. Love when I don't have to grab the shaker. Staff was helpful. Food came quickly. Poutine was absolutely delicious, plenty of cheese and gravy. The dipping sauces were plentiful and tasty. Very reasonably priced. Will be back and will bring others."}
{"text":"I had not previously had frites before my trip to Mad City, so I can't speak on authenticity or compare them to others around town. I can say that they were tasty and crazy filling. Having never been before and making the awesome, adult life choice to eat fries for dinner, my boyfriend and I each ordered a large frites. A small order comes with one sauce, and a large comes with two - as a sauce lover, I figured I might as well just go for the large since it was the same cost as a small with an extra sauce. I did not need a large. My boyfriend and I could have easily split one. Having four sauces, though, was awesome. I regret nothing.   Mad Sauce - their signature, I couldn't put my finger on the exact flavor but I'm guessing it was ketchup, mayo, and maybe something else.  Game Day Garlic - I want all the garlic, and sadly this mostly just tasted like a sweet mayo.  Bascom Hill BBQ - tasty, thick barbecue sauce.  Isthmus Honey Mustard - one of the best honey mustards I've had. A really good balance. Probably my favorite of the four, which surprised me.   The frites themselves were extra thick and extra crispy. The insides were creamy and piping hot. Like, insanely hot. Due to the thick crust they stayed hot for the duration. It's a double-edged sword - nobody likes cold fries, but it's also nice to not burn your mouth. Snapping the frites in half helped let the steam escape and come down to an acceptable temperature.   Looking forward to trying a few more of their sauces!"}
{"text":"They need to make frites like Cafe Hollander not like my uncles backyard fish fry. If they do this I will go back. Respect the sauce game though."}
{"text":"Cool concept. The fries and the sauces are delicious--my friends and I got a bunch of different ones... the garlic/rosemary and the madcity sauce were my favs. But be forewarned... this is literally just fries and sauces to dip them in. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"I must have eaten half a ton of fries in my day, but these were the best by a longshot. It's not even close. Just try them. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I thought the fries weren't nearly crispy enough, even though the gravy on the poutine was very good. Madison needs more late night food spots, so I'm still glad that Mad City Frites opened and is open late."}
{"text":"Delicious. Perfect. I will get them every time I walk downtown Madison. I had the Mad City sauce! Best fries in Madison. And I know fries."}
{"text":"Mad City Frites is definitely a nice addition to State St, especially as a place to hang out and catch up with friends or study. They have games, plenty of space, outlets everywhere, and a nice ambiance. I was not a fan of the frites, however.  The place is small but spacious, with some fun little nooks facing State St (perfect for people watching!) and a few comfortably sized tables. You order frites or poutine at the counter, with your choice of sauces (1 or 2 depending on the size of your order). The food is made to order. I tried a large order, which comes with 2 sauces. The sauces I chose were garlic and the Mad Sauce (a tangy-sweet sauce).   The frites were way too large for my tastes. They were too big and thick to get crispy at all, and after eating a few it was like just eating starch. This could have been redeemed with flavorful sauces, but I found the sauces lightly seasoned and very heavy. Both were aioli-type sauces and were more sweet than savory, which was surprising for the garlic sauce.   I think Mad City Frites could benefit from offering a thinner cut fry for those of us who enjoy crispier frites. I also feel that beer would be an awesome addition to a place like this, so I hope they are working toward getting an alcohol license! I did enjoy the ambiance here, and would recommend it as a spot to meet up with friends if you don't mind a thicker cut fry."}
{"text":"The barbecue sauce is delicious! Great concept for a quick bite! The tables are special with holes for your fries cone. They have some board games by the window so you can people watch and play as you eat! Very chill atmosphere. I wish they gave me more sauce, but at least the ketchup is free."}
{"text":"Freshly cut frites served up with a choice of 14 sauces (beyond ketchup & mustard). All ages & demographics enjoying a stroll on State Street for a crispy treat. A little salty for my taste that took away from the sauces. I will be back to try more sauces."}
{"text":"Simple menu--potatoes and poutine only, and they do it well!  Order your fries (small or large) and choose your sauce. The large included 2 sauces, and ketchup, mayo, and malt vinegar were available at each table. My sauces were garlic and sriracha mayo. Personally, I would have preferred a less citrusy/bright garlic sauce with more of a roasted garlic flavor. My fries were made to order.  For to-go orders, they'll put your cone in a paper bag.   As for the fries themselves, they were very good.  For frites, a thinner fry than what's available at Mad City is more my preference, although these were excellent.  Restaurant has wi-fi and the tables have handy holes so that you can have your cone upright when you eat. Tip--the lighting is a bit dim. I was almost positive that they were closed when I walked by.  Overall, I recommend!"}
