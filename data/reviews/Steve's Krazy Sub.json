{"text":"Wow, based on the other reviews, people seem to really like this place.  I thought it was OK.  I got the all meat sub which had a generous portion of meat, but all of the condiments on the sandwich made it really wet and a bit of a mess to eat.  It was a pretty good deal - I think it was $7 for the sandwich, chips and a soda - but given the choice between a Subway and this place, it would really be a toss up."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Bread is delicious and the people that work here are always so fast, friendly and efficient. Great job crazy subs!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the difference is between Steve's and Ned's. I think it's in part the bread as someone else mentioned, but I've noticed that Ned's sandwiches are dry in comparison to Steve's. I don't know if Steve puts more mayo or what but they sandwiches always end up really good!"}
{"text":"I typically have had amazing experiences here and have been going here for several years, but as I entered last night it was the absolute worst experience I've has at this place leaving a sour taste and still an upset customer 24 hours later, with no response from a supervisor/manager/owner. When I entered with a friend there were two workers in the store, one playing the arcade games and the other cleaning. They looked up at us as if we interrupted gossip hour. It wasn't like we came in five minutes before closing, you still had a half hour. As I walked to the counter to order food, a brief period went by and the girl previously playing her game met me at the counter,She blankly looked at me. I ordered my sandwich and the response I received when I finished talking was \"K\".  At this point I was annoyed, no up-sale offers were made, chips/drinks/ dessert, which I probably would have taken. She was completely rude. She proceeded to take my payment and as she handed my ticket to the other girl she knocked over an entire stack of cups onto the floor, the other girl walked around picked up the cups walked back around and proceeded to make the sandwich WITHOUT CHANGING HER GLOVES. Not only did the original girl bypass saying more than K to me, she ignored the person I was with and did not ask if she was ordering anything, which originally walking into the place we both wanted sandwiches. But with the Horrible customer service we just wanted to get out with the sandwich we unfortunately paid for. When I got home, I called another store to request a phone number for upper management of some kind or an email to discuss this matter, and the best the person could do was take down my name and number and state I would receive a call today. Which I never received a call. If this were my Store I would want to know how crappy it was being ran. If I was mediocre service I would go to a sandwich chain instead of trying to boost local business. My advice, take customer service lessons from your local Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"This place is getting worst and worst. I waiting 20 minutes for 4 subs. WTH is going on. When the gals were I was in and out of that place in less then 7 minutes. You got the owner or the owners son which has ZERO PERSONALITY, the other 2 were retards. I think you may want to go back to Temple because that is were you belong. Your passion for sub making is ZERO. Or please just do us all a favor and sell  the business."}
{"text":"Good prices and good basic subs. Nothing fancy but if you want a quick sub and you are in the area it is a much better alternative than the major chains. I like the lunch specials. The Poorboy is pretty good but make sure to ask for easy mayo unless you like a ton of mayo on your sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and rootbeer floats..I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Great subs, friendly service. Just as good as Ned's, but Steve's has root beer ice cream and you can watch them make the \"samiches\". Never had a better sub than their 12\" hot turkey on white with everything. Kids love their pizza boat too."}
{"text":"Great subs! Very fresh ingredients and fast service!"}
{"text":"6\" Torpedo with voodo chips are a great combo! You can't go wrong eating here. This food is a Az classic. It's a really simple sandwich and that's why so many like it."}
{"text":"I was here one time before I bought a Groupon for this place. The Italian Herb bread is so good. I always get the vegetarian sandwich, so I'm not sure, or care, about the meat portions. Every time I go, there is friendly service and the food is good. They have a great lunch deal too!"}
{"text":"Tried a sub for the first and last time yesterday.   Tried the super sub. The only thing I could taste was bologna.  And that was not even one of the meats that was supposed to be in it.  The whole sandwich was just gross."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, nice young adults working there. Stopped in to kill some time and chow a sub. Kills subway! Super awesome in every way.

If I didn't live 40 miles away I'd be here often.

Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"One reviewer said this place is out of business. It most certainly is not. Here at lunchtime on a Saturday and the place is hopping.

The subs are good when you are in the mood for a kinda greasy, soft, comfort food kind of meal.  I had the lunch special and left feeling a bit gross.  OK every once in a while."}
{"text":"I went here twice since then and the workers were much nicer, no bratty attitudes, still teenagers but thats fine with me. Now I'm obsessed with this place, the food is sooo good! I love their bread and the ton of lettuce they put on your sandwich. My favorite so far is the warm roast beef, try it, it's great!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Filthy. Gross. And the sub was mediocre at best. Lesson learned. Never again."}
{"text":"I had a roach in my ice and a small bug in my sandwich...I've eaten here several times, but I will not again.  To their credit, the refunded the cost of my meal!"}
{"text":"These are my favorite sandwiches in town so I was really disappointed when I saw the reviews for this retaurant.  I hope it does well so it doesn't disappear like the New York pizza place just around the corner a while back.

Maybe I don't have as sophisticated of taste as others because I find the sandwich quite tasty.  Or maybe it's just the sandwich I get, the pastrami on wheat, but my wife raves about it too.  Whenever I have brought my family here it's been happy smiles all around.  

I am always amazed at what people complain about too.  The flavor of the vinegar and oil? Really?  The sandwich selection is quite extensive unlike those other shops reviewers seem to like so much - three sizes of sandwich, lots of variety.  Try even getting a pastrami or a \"pizza sub\", the 8 year old's favorite, just about anywhere else.  And about the amount of meat, as if those other places are any different, ever try double meat?  It's only a buck fitty bro.  Port o' Subs?  Did you really say that?

I can see getting frustrated with the speed of service.  I have found it to be a little inefficient and not real timely.  I've often wondered how they would handle any real volume of movie traffic with the theaters next door.

Maybe one of the problems is owner involvement - I asked the staff how the shop is doing and he said, ok, about 70% of business is repeat customers (so I guess someone besides me likes these sandwiches too).  I asked if the shop was his and he said no manager or owner was there at the time.  And they had no clue what people are saying about them on Yelp.  Can you say \"epic fail\"?  I hope they get a clue about their ratings soon and fix the problem so  I don't have to go to those other lousy places mentioned elsewhere, like that over blown epic-wanna-be Firehouse.

Anyway, give it a try, have a little patience, I think you will be rewarded."}
{"text":"The subs are amazing! I always get the sub club, which has ham, turkey, bacon, provolone cheese on white bread. The bread, shedded lettuce, onion, mayo and mustard really make the sandwich. The bacon comes crispy, which brings out the entire flavor of everything."}
{"text":"Awesome subs!.... poor boy sub is my favorite... bread very good... owner is a great guy... I grew up with there first restaurant on guadalupe and dobson 30 years ago!  Staff very friendly.... tasty subs at a great price..."}
{"text":"Very delicious, super clean, and extremely polite!! 
I took my boy's in for an inexpensive sandwich that was very good, fresh, and I highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for a sub sandwich or on a tight budget.
  As the very polite young man was taking the rest of our order, 2 equally polite and young ladies were prepping the order when one turn's and asked if we didn't mind wheat bread because she was out of fresh white bread then said she had some that was a day old, if we'd like but she suggested not to, so no big deal we took the wheat. Mmmmmm mmmmmm my son LOVED the wheat, so naturally I had to check it for \"poison\" ;) and no kidding all, that is some VERY GOOD bread!  

Our experience here was superb from the ordering process to eating. We are looking forward to our next visit!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the club and it was amazing! Nice service... Love the bread and great Swiss cheese... The one thing I would critique is that they ran out of bell peppers and it seems from other reviews running out of things is quite common here."}
{"text":"I love a good Po'boy, so after reading Janee's review I had to give it a try. I have to say Poorboy on white with everything cold is a mean sub. My girl got the turkey sub, \"it's okay but not as good as jimmy johns...\" She's a picky eater but her sub looked delicious. $13 for two lunch specials wasn't bad at at all.

The staff were very friendly, and overall Steve's is a great mom n pop sub shop. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped off here Friday night after shopping for the first and last time. Service was great but the sandwiches were not. Ordered 2 turkeys and 2 meatball subs. The meatballs were the size of marbles anf the turkey subs had 2 thin pieces of meat on them. If you luv bread this is the place to go. Sorry because I try to eat at the neighborhood places, but this one no more."}
{"text":"Yum! Trying this place made me take Subway off of my list. The staff was super helpful, quick and friendly. Sub was great! Under $9 gets you a full size sub, side and drink. The turkey sub is my go-to."}
{"text":"Came in at 2:45 on a Saturday afternoon. 3 people working. Not one other customer in the store. Every single table and the whole floor were disgusting. Made me a little scared to venture into the restroom. 

Processed rubbery meat....yuck!!   Go to port of subs where they the meat fresh or firehouse which is just yummy all the around!!!!"}
{"text":"I've Been here a bunch of times and the sandwiches are always awesome. The bread is yummy and the service is good too! They are closed on Sunday's but it's a good sub shop."}
{"text":"This place is ok. We have some buy one get ones from a school discount card, so we've been several times. With the coupon it makes it about $10 for two sandwich meals - cheap dinner! The staff is never friendly, and that loses a star. Also the sandwich bread is blah - nothing that stands out about it. Would only go back if I had a coupon."}
{"text":"my favorite place for a sub sandwich.  Like other reviewers said, nothing fancy here, just a good sandwich on good bread.  Call me crazy, but I think its the shredded lettuce that makes them so darn good!  

Faves:  BLT, a very generous serving of bacon that's actually crispy.  Don't skip the mayo, its worth every calorie to make it the very best.

Poor Boy:  Was my fave until I tried the BLT.  Nothing fancy, just delicious, with a generous serving of meat.

Kids Fave: Pizza Boat.  

Other: PEPSI products! Yeah! Well, I don't care, but since my husband's blood is most likely 90% Diet Pepsi by now, its a plus..

Always appears clean, food always delicious, service always friendly.  We eat here somewhere near once a month, have been to a \"competitor\" (really, its silly to call that place Jared likes to eat a competitor, because they really aren't the same kinds of businesses at all) once in the last year, and remembered after one bite why we always choose Steve's for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok. Relatively cheap for sandwich.  My sandwich was filing but tasteless.  Not sure what they use for oil and vinegar but it had no taste.  Even the meat was bland.  Weird."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a sub. Love that they offer Marconi or Potato salad as an alternative to chips. Food was fresh and the service was friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"A good sub, far better than Subway or the other chains.   A good sized sandwich for a reasonable price.  I like the senior discount that they give.  The staff was polite and the sandwich was made quickly.  All of the ingredients seemed fresh and the bread was soft.   I still think Jimmy Johns is better, but this place comes in a close second.  Jimmy Johns seems to give you more meat, but I didn't weigh the product from both places to verify that.  But I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Been in here twice in the last 2 weeks. Overall, not bad. Seems a bit pricey but the subs are actually pretty darn filling for the price. I'm a pretty big guy and can eat a full foot long at subway. Here I can eat almost a full 12 inch sandwich but I'm really struggling to finish it. I'm surprised at other reviews because my sandwich always has plenty of meat in it. Sure they don't have a large variety of veggies but we have gotten somewhat spoiled with the subs from other competitors. I think the basics, lettuce, tomatoes, onions are sufficient. On top of that they usually offer you a dill pickle spear.  The folks here seem to be friendly, not overly though but I don't ever see a frown, The place inside surely could be a bit cleaner. Tables wiped, floors picked up etc.  I hope they read this review as this would give them the hint that cleanliness is very important here. Love the subs though and yes I will be back. Staff needs to work just a tiny bit more on smiling, greeting and thanking their customers. I see continued success here if they give details to little oversights."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Steve's for years! The food-awesome ! Service -awesome! My favorite sandwich place EVER!! But, don't like the new debit/credit machine because you are forced to leave a tip! (My husband won't go back because of it) I'm not opposed to leaving tips but I rarely do for fast food and coffee etc. So it bugs me that I HAVE to."}
{"text":"Love this sub shop. It is fresh, cheap and always provides great customer service. I'm a big fan of the veggie sub in the lunch special. I will go here over a Subway or Quiznos any day...except for Sundays when they are closed (my only complaint.)"}
{"text":"I thought the tuna sub was just ok. Poor slow service. Cookie sandwiches looked good but I didn't get one."}
{"text":"Does this valley need another sub shop? No, it certainly doesn't. This seems to be a family-owned enterprise and the value is maybe just a wee bit better than the national franchises, so maybe it's not the first one I'd drive through if I happened to have a bulldozer at my disposal.

It's still just a sub though, and I thought this particular sandwich was in the style of Blimpie's. The bread is a little bit on the thick side, heavy on the lettuce that looks like it was run through a document shredder, plus a reasonable quantity of meat."}
{"text":"Wanted this place to be as good as Ned's, not so.  Ordered the barbecue beef sub and could not even finish it, so gross.  The meat was see thru, fatty and slimy.  I give this place one star because of the delicious cookie ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Since Steve's, ill never eat subway again. Great food. Awesome staff. Cool owner. You can't get any better."}
{"text":"Laura went out of her way to help us with a catering order that another vendor messed up. It was for 85 lunches. She came in on her day off and fulfilled the request. I am so grateful and the customer service she showed us was amazing! The food was great and I highly recommend them!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Krazy Sub! I continue to go to this location because it is closest to where I normally am, otherwise I would preferably go to the location on signal butte. The employees at this location are nice but not overly friendly. The location is not always super clean as you have to look at tables closely before choosing one. When I request my subs and salads to be made a certain way they are normally not as I requested and 1 or 2 things will be wrong. 

   I did however sign up for their text alerts and I will randomly receive a text telling me of specials they have going on. I always go in when I receive a text because they are such great deals!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Krazy Sub locations I have been to this is by far my favorite. The employees are very good at recording your requests and fulfilling your orders 100%. The employees are also very friendly and this location is always super clean.

I have yet to try a item on the menu that I do not like. Be sure to try their amazing salads, for around $5 you'll get such a big salad you'll have to save some for later!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Krazy Sub for a while as a quick dinner/lunch option!  Their ingredients are fresh, service is good, and they carry Pepsi products!  Each sub comes with a pickle too, which is delicious.  They also sell \"Granny B's Cookies\" which are a must, even if you don't want dessert.

The area where the shop is located is convenient; I usually eat and then go shopping for groceries afterwards."}
{"text":"You know you're going to have a sad sub when you see 2 microwaves behind the counter but I wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt. Wrong move.  Worse soggy sub I've ever eaten and I've eaten lots of subs. Tables and floors were dirty and I was the only one here. There were 3 teenage girls working and they can care less about customer service.  They represent how the owner conducts business and I predict they won't be here too much longer."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, after getting a great deal on Groupon. Employees are more than friendly, they have great meal deals and are located right next to the movie theaters. Prices aren't too bad, if I hadn't had the Groupon deal, subs were nice and fresh, I just wish it was piled higher and they had more of a variety of  veggies to put on their subs (example: I had to ask my hubby if his sub even had tuna in it, because they put so much lettuce on it, you couldn't even see the tuna). 

Overall the taste was good. 

A step up from Subway, but can't compare to Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"What a joke. I thought Subway was stingy with their meats until I came here.
Sandwich wasn't bad, but there was practically no meat or toppings on it.

I've heard the bbq sandwich is a lot better than the Italian, which I got."}
{"text":"I drove out here after visiting the location on power/main that had subpar standards (dirty restaurant, absent workers, day old bread) and was very pleased with the customer service and sandwich."}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time on 6/5/2015 at around 7pm. I walked up and noticed the restaurant was empty before I even walked in and when I opened the door and took a step inside I had to step around a big spill of soda. I walked to the register and only had to wait a few seconds for the 2 teenage girl employees to come out. They told me they only had day old bread because they were slow that day. I asked if it was still good or hard and she was like \"well it's not bad but it's stored in the fridge so it's cold and hard\" then she held it up in the plastic to feel and it was very firm. The employees didn't really seem to care about being there. I was very disappointed since I had been wanting to get another krazy sub after visiting krazy air the other week. I left that location and called the one on signal butte and found out they are owned by different people and they had fresh bread so I drove out there. Needless to say, I will never visit the krazy sub on power and main again."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sub I've had since I've moved to Phoenix. Everyone is so friendly and the food is made quickly! Amazing sandwiches! My favorite is the super sub! Can't go wrong coming here!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Took my family there last night! We ordered and waited close to 15 minutes for our sandwiches. We all ordered HOT subs and they all were cold. We let the workers know and they said \"do you want us to heat them up\"? We ordered 5 subs and they all had all the fixin's. DIdn't  apologize just asked if we wanted to be heated. No thanks hot wilted lettuce and tomato doesn't sound good! Very upset."}
{"text":"A true mom and pop sub shop. Prices are very low. I ordered a 12\" supersub and it was awesome. The bread was so nice and soft - I can't wait to go back and try some more!"}
{"text":"Really good sub for the price especially if you like juicy subs. Service is usually friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Very Basic Sabdwich, but good.  Good value also. Weird area, but good."}
{"text":"Awesome subs and always quick, friendly service!  Super bummed they are closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to any of the other locations, just picked up a sub while the kids were getting haircuts next door.
The food was ok, nothing special, nothing bad, just average.
One thing that I thought was weird, they're put my sandwich in what was obviously bags the owners brought from home from a grocery shopping store.  They were tied in a ball like i do when I put my bags away."}
{"text":"Yelp needs to change the name, it is Steve's. place is awesome. If you don't like their bread it's probably because you are use to garbage subway. These subs are so bomb, if you get everything on them it's so delicious. Also every sub comes with a pickle, what more do you need."}
{"text":"Alway a big fan of Krazy sub good bread fresh veggies and meat. Sandwich's that are properly proportioned quick service what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I've been going to Steve's before it was even Steve's (before him and Ned parted ways).

I love this place. Kinda sketchy location but I'm totally ok with that since I swear they haven't raised their prices in 20+ years. My fav sandwich shop in the east valley, even over Ned's (dare I say it). The reason I compare the two is because they are basically one in the same - same menu, same decor, right down to the old arcade games. Where Steve prevails for me is that I like their bread better and I don't have to deal with snotty Mt. View teens working at Ned's. Sometimes there are teens working at Steve's but they are so much more polite than Ned's employees. Usually though, there are the sweetest middle-aged ladies working at Steve's.

The food is really good. I've pretty much had everything on the menu over the years, but my favorite is still the poor boy on white with everything cold :) In fact, I love the subs here so much I had Steve's cater my kids birthday party last year.

Great Mesa institution. No frills. Just good sandwiches and friendly service. Good enough for me."}
{"text":"We were watching the travel channel and they had a show on sandwiches so we needed a fix and this place fixed us up real nice. We got a pastrami and provolone, a club and a super sub and they were all delicious. The pickles hit the spot. Will definetly go back"}
{"text":"Only thing crazy about this place was the guy outside the front door. Place looks like they made it in the 80s and kept it that way. The bread was soft and the sandwich wasn't too bad. I thought I read someone call this better than jimmy johns...his ugly cousin maybe. Other then being plane jane , the place was fairly clean, fast and freindly. I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been coming here for years ! I would eat this over any other sub place I've ever been in."}
{"text":"I probably eat at Krazy Sub 2-3x's a month. I have never ventured outside of getting the Poorboy. I love this sub because it reminds me of my boyhood and the sandwiches mom made. Yeah the floors and tables are a little dirty. And the garbage may be full. I usually get to go so that doesn't bother me. My wife has had subs here too, I can't remember which ones, but she's never complained. The staff is always very friendly, and I've never had a problem of waiting or getting waited on. I'll continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"First time here and the provolone cheese is really good.  The bread is good and there is flavorful meat.  We got the roast beef and a club.  Pile on the toppings and sauce and you have a winner!  Way better than subway !"}
{"text":"This place wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so dirty! You can see a layer of filth on the cabinet doors behind the counter, between the glass and the sub making station, on the dressing bottles (that the server touches while making sandwiches), the floor, the tables, and even the one video game they have was filthy. I bought and ate a sub, anyway, and ended up with an upset stomach for the rest of the afternoon. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch special.  8\" poor boy (hot or cold) bag of chips and a drink for 5 bucks.  The bread is very fresh, staff always friendly, fast service and very dependable for a good sandwich.  Kind of a hole in the wall in not the greatest shopping center in Mesa, but a very pleasant sub shop I look forward to visiting at least once a week."}
{"text":"Whether it's Ned's or Steve's they do a really good job at producing a consistent product. Great price and simple sandwiches. They've been around forever and are great folks!"}
{"text":"Great subs! The girls were friendly and had our subs ready in no time at all. We tried this place because of the Yelp reviews, they were right on."}
{"text":"The place is pretty good, but could use some consistency. Each time I've gone in, they handle things differently - the last time, they actually asked for my order ahead of time, wrote it down, and made the sandwich based off of this little paper - odd. They also don't seem to understand that \"oil and vinegar\" means just that, and not italian dressing - I could see the oil and vinegar with my own eyes, I know they have it! Ugh. 

Food is decent, service is decent, they just need something memorable to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch at Steve's. The service was friendly and fast, the dining area was clean with lively background music, the price was very good ($6.75 for 8\" sub, side, pickle, and drink), and my turkey sub tasted great with tasty fresh bread, a good amount of turkey, and fresh veggies. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Great prices. Plenty of meat and cheese on sandwich as well as fixins. Never going back to subway. I had supersub and it was super. Wish they were open sundays."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. They have a good solid sub for a decent price.  I grew up on Ned's, but they are further away and Steve's is just as good. I called in my order today and phone rang and rang. I was worried they had shut down permanently or something. I tried calling back in a few minutes and they answered. HALLELUJAH! This pregnant lady was craving a sub from here something fierce! When I picked it up the employees were very nice and all of them young. One even apologized for how long it took for them to answer the phone. They were pretty swamped when I went in but were working efficiently. The place was clean and orderly and I have no complaints. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I just walked out after waiting upfront for 5 minutes with no one coming upfront to serve me. The girls were giggling in the back and even walked towards the soda machine to try and get in their line if site. There are plenty of other places to eat if you don't want my business."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! Idk what people are complaining about there's enough meat on the sandwiches I would like more cheese but that's bc I put a lot of cheese on my sandwiches. Have good lunch deals and almost always a groupon deal, which I love."}
{"text":"I've been going to Steve's Krazy subs since 1987 and it hadn't changed at all!!!  The prices have barely gone up. And they consistently make the very best subs in town.  Hands down!!!!"}
{"text":"Average Sub. Nothing wrong with the service or staff, or cleanliness of the place ...it was just pretty bland on the inside and the bread, quality of cold cuts, and overall taste was just average. I stopped in during one of those indecisive moments of where should I get food, and with so many places in the overall shopping center (Gilbert Rd off the 202) I ended up trying this place out.  It's not that I wouldn't go again, but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"This is a good little sub place. It's not up there with Capriottis or PotBelly but it's definitely better than Subway and places like Cousins. It's in a weird little shopping mall next to big lots and a dollar store but it has good value for a clean, basic sandwich."}
{"text":"My child was starving after a dentist visit, so we waited the requisite 30 minutes,   and then off we were to Steve's Krazy Subs. We had never been here before and thought it would be a good idea to try this instead of the big chains.

In every city I have lived, there is always that one place were the service is awful, yet the food is so good, you are happy to put up with crappy service, well turn around and keep looking because this is not that place.

When I was ready to order, I looked at the teenage boy and said Hi! He glared. I placed my order. He told me the total and I handed him my credit card. He ran it and gave me a receipt, so I asked if he needed my signature since this was a credit transaction. He said no and stuffed the receipt in the register and slammed it shut. 
The only friendly person there was the girl who handed me our food. 
I don't know if this kid was having a bad day or what was going on for him to be so rude to us, but I do know I am not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm closer to the jimmy johns sub shop they just opened but I drive up here to get my lunch. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here over the weekend, and it was alright. I ended up getting the 8 inch roast beef sub cold, and really enjoyed it.  I was impressed with how the sub came out, taste wise.

My only thing, is that this place is kind of dumpy...in a weird way.  I like the food, but something lacks about the service/location.  Its not bad, just more, um, less then what I had expected?  Thus, the 3 stars. If it was on food alone, I would have given it 5.  Honestly, I think this place could probably do A LOT better service wise, and to spice it up a little in there."}
{"text":"I have been going to Steve's for about 2 years.  The last two times I have been there and ordered the same thing (Ham & cheese sub) I only get one slice of ham.  I am not sure if they have changed workers or just cutting corners but It sure isn't what it used to be.  It's time to look for another sub place!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? This place is classy! Especially the employees! My partner and I tried Krazy Subs for the first time last week, and I must say...had one of the best club sandwiches I can remember! They took great care of us and treated us like family. Definitely my kind of restaurant. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First Time I went here the girls made my sandwich (blt) and it was terrible. It was so bad I didn't go back for weeks. I tried it again and got the boys that work at night to make me a club. It was amazing ! Maybe even better then jimmy johns. If you come for a sandwich come at night. The younger guys working are the A team!  Do not get a sandwhich from the ladies working there!!"}
{"text":"It's nice to find a mom & pop sub place intown that has great quality sandwiches for a good price... the staff was very friendly, place was clean and the food was great.  I'll be back next time that I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We were at a birthday party and there was this yummy 4 ft long sub there.  My daughter (5) declared it was the best sub she has ever had.  We have been to the actually place many times (sort of grubby in a grubby area) but it is very good.  The kids meal comes with a small soft serve cone in vanilla or rootbeer."}
{"text":"Excellent subs!  I had the \"Torpedo\" which was a ham, hard salami, Capicola. The homemade bread is great and they put just the right amount of topping on."}
{"text":"Excellent Subs, So far its been consistent for me. The actual store could use some work and decor, but what would I expect out front of a community college.

Lunch Deal is also great. $5 bucks for 8\" Sub, chips n Drink... I wouldn't expect more service since, the price is great. If they hired some knowledgeable experiences service staff, they would need to pay more, thus prices going up.. I am totally kewl with the way they are.."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place! Their subs are great and they have these \"voodoo chips\" they are a mix between salt and vinegar and something else... really good. Their ice cream and ice cream sandwiches are fantastic! They use the cookies they make ( soft even when cold!) and they put several scoops of whatever ice cream you want between two cookies of your choice. One of my favorite desserts! 
When you go there, that corner looks a little sketchy and so does the store but most of the time their are families in the shop."}
{"text":"Over the last couple times that I have visited, the quality of my sandwiches has been steadily declining. Today I received the worst one yet: the tomatoes were paper thin and sparse, there was barely any mustard or mayo, and the meat was less than half of what I used to receive. The overwhelming bulk of my sandwich was lettuce. 

This leads me to conclude that either my sandwiches have been made improperly by (wonderful) heavy-handed employees in the past who have now been reined in, or times have gotten tougher than normal and the establishment is cutting back on quantity. Either way, I miss the sandwiches of old and will be looking for a new  place to go to from now on.

In all seriousness though, kudos to the ninja chef with the razor sharp knives/swords that can cut tomato slices so well. I see those late night TV advertisements for knives and kitchen cutting utensils all the time, and slicing thin tomatoes seems to be one of the favorite demonstrations to show the product's quality. But those TV tomatoes got NOTHING on the see through slices coming out of Steve's Krazy Sub!"}
{"text":"Great subs, exceptional value, am now a customer for life!

Food: Very good.  Ingredients are fresh, bread is really good, great selection of chips and drinks, and cheap ice cream cones too!

Atmosphere: Clean and welcoming.  Kids working the counter, seniors eating ice cream cones.  I like it.

Price/Value: Excellent - I bought sandwiches, chips and drinks for myself, wife and two kids all for fifteen bucks.  In today's economy that is exceptional for the food you get!

Special Note: This is a local business run by a local family.  They get my money from now on when our family is hungry for subs."}
{"text":"Mm Steve's Krazy Subs are delicious!  I've been to the location on Southern and Dobson as well, and they are doing things the same!  Both excellent, tasty, bargain subs!  They call an 8-inch sub a \"mini\" for crying out loud!  You can get the lunch special for $5 even including tax.  That'll get you an 8\" sub, Lay's or Fritos, and a small soda!  Excellent!  The way they make the dressings is just so tasty!  Both locations also have a big screen tv that's always playing those comforting sitcoms (\"King of Queens\" etc.) when I stop in for lunch.  The sandwiches are ready so fast too!  I couldn't ask for a better place to eat on my lunch break.  :)  You can even call ahead and order your sub, though I've never had to wait long when I come in and order either."}
{"text":"Really really good subs!  I've heard from a reliable source that the guys who run Ned's and the guys who run Steve's are related.  That explains why their subs are equally delicious!  Fresh tasty white bread was the most memorable part of my sub.  I think the cheese here is A+ as well!  I know I'll be back whenever I'm in that area!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. Sure it was a huge sandwich filled with meat. Unfortunately it's very gristly meat. Not a lot of flavor except for salt. Way too much salt. The bread is soft and the best part of the sandwich. I made it a point to ask if there were pickles in the sandwich and was told no. I remarked that I loath pickles and was relieved. There weren't any IN the sandwich, but they wrap a BIG spear in between the wrapper of the sandwich so that the pickle juice can absorb through. Nasty. The iced tea was yummy. There is a layer of dirt all over the walls and flooring. I don't generally care as long as counters and hands are kept clean, but it makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like. I ate maybe a third if one half of the sandwich after pulling out all of the gristle and tossed the rest out. It was just meh. I'll keep looking for a decent sandwich spot. I won't be back."}
