{"text":"Hardly worth it for the price.   Nice atmosphere. It seemed like a family friendly restaurant where everyone was all dressed up. Small space, but can fit a large amount of people in it. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, very simple, yet elegant.   Aside from the decor, I would say the quality of the food for the price is below par.  The ravioli was great, but it was just a simple ravioli in plain tomato sauce. Really? Can we get at least a little bit more creative here? For 12 bucks, plus tax and tip ( I think I paid in total around $16), 7 pieces of ravioli in a tomato sauce in a simple white plate is not worth $16. Especially for a college guy. I would rather get something else, something more meaty and filling, for the same price.  Not worth eating here if you're HUNGRY or low on CASH. The food is not bad, but not that great either. I could make the same thing for 1/10th of the price."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see as many mixed reviews here because I had a terrific dinner here tonight. I ordered the wedding soup and the lasagna. Both were superb. The pasta for the lasagna is made on the premises and it was perfect. Prices are very reasonable, the portions are generous, and the service excellent. I'd go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Akron, and we made a special trip to go to little Italy for dinner. Trattoria looked like a good place, so we tried it. We made reservations, and were seated promptly.  Service was fast and good. I ordered the chicken Parmesan, and my wife got the eggplant Parmesan. The food was just average. The sauce was quite bland. Portion sizes were good, just not that flavorful. Dining room was crowded and tables are very close together. Overall, Trattoria is average."}
{"text":"I'm from NY originally so I've had a lot of Italian food, however when I have the oportunity to get to Cleveland this is my firt stop from the airport. Great Eggplant Parm and Lazangna. Bruchetta is out of this world. Bought some to take home."}
{"text":"I've only had pizza here, and it was good.  We customized ours with prosciutto, chicken, and onions.  There aren't a ton of choices for toppings, but enough I suppose. Our waitress was ok: not good, not bad. Pizza prices are great.  Go with some friends, do splitsies, and your wallet will be happy."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner there last evening and the best that I can say is that the service was attentive. The food was simply mediocre. It was a special occasion for us and while we are not inclined to complain, unless there is a glaring issue, we would never return. We are Italian, we are a family of people who love to cook and most of what we had was just not worth going out for. Sorry to say."}
{"text":"Staff lies and then is rude afterwards.  First the hostess could not understand our name 3x, and after finally getting it, still came back to ask it again. Apparently that was just the indication of things to come as he said that all tables are booked, but we'd have to wait about 10 minutes to get seated. When after 15 minutes I asked for how long should we still wait, I was told that it's going to be at least additional 15 minutes. When I asked why I was told 10 minutes when I arrived, hostess told that it is what it is, we should have made a reservation, and we could leave if we did not like something. Which we did.  I will certainly never go to that place again."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant based on recommendations on Yelp.  We were so disappointed!  The food was so basic and actually inedible in one case.  I had the clams and linguine in white sauce.  It tasted like the clams were from a tin and stop eating after a few minutes as my stomach started rolling in protest.  The eggplant parmesan wasn't much better...the marina sauce was lacking in any salt or spices.  The pesto sauce also didn't taste like any other pesto sauce I have had (not in a good way).  All three of us had upset stomachs that evening after eating there.  The bread tasted like bread you would get in a supermarket aisle.  I can't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade Italian food served in very large portions.  The staff is welcoming and friendly.  The cannolis are a great way to wrap up dinner, if you still have room!  Cozy, authentic, and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been to Trattoria several times...with family and friends. Recently I had the fettuccine alfredo and it was delicious. So much I had it for lunch the next two days also. Definitely a good bang for your buck in little italy!"}
{"text":"We went here with a party of 6 on a sunny afternoon. We were greeted by an extremely friendly hostess. We wanted to sit on the patio but in the shade and she did her best to accommodate us. Our service was excellent. The best part though, was the food. The antipasto salad was out of this world. We should've ordered 2 it was so good!! The fresh bread they gave us was addicting! Most of the people I ate with had spaghetti with meatballs or sausage and they all raved about it. I had the chicken parm and it was done perfectly! It was by far one of the best meals I've had during my stay in clevelb"}
{"text":"So, so good.  We had the gnocchi and split the meatballs.  The have the best gnocchi, my advice is to split the portion with the table or whomever you are dining with.  My wife and I split the lunch portion and had plenty!"}
{"text":"After attending the White Coat Ceremony at Case Med on Sunday, my husband, father-in-law and I headed here for dinner.  It was my choice and I take full responsibility.  I will clarify by saying I'm a recent Bay Area transplant to Cleveland, so I'm still figuring out the local menu idiosyncrasies.  My first mistake was ordering \"fresh\" mussels.  They were mushy and flavorless.  I then ordered the homemade gnocchi - another mistake.  The dumplings should melt in your mouth.  These were like rocks.  The sauce was spaghettio-like and disappointing as well.    My husband had the linguini with \"fresh\" mussels in a red clam sauce.  The mussels were his choice.  The sauce had some garlic flavor to it, but it was mostly bland.  My father-in-law had the chicken marsala which he liked, but chose not to taste.    The service was quick and friendly and they had a decent beer selection - but I'm definitely crossing this one off the list.   After a really exciting morning, this was a disappointing way to end the day.   I think I'll try La Dolce Vita next."}
{"text":"It has been 8 years since we have dined here.  We live out of town and happen to be in this weekend.  Service was excellent and our food from the antipasto to the Linguini with Clam Sauce to the Chicken Marsala was outstanding.  We will definitely be back a lot sooner than 8 years!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience ever, and I have been coming here since I moved to Cleveland.  Was given water and bread by two different people. Neither said one word to us.  Server walks up, \" did you want something to drink?\"  That's was it.  Walk to the restroom and moved out of the way for the hostess and she passes without a word. Another gentleman from my table did the same for her and again nothing. Our server was very inattentive and curt. I'm hoping this was an isolated incident. I will give them one more chance and that is it. Very disappointing when I have always had a great experience."}
{"text":"Server had no personality. But the lasagna made up for it. A big hearty portion. I could have took half of it home and had another meal, but I couldn't resist. They don't skimp on the sauce either! Will go again and eat more."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! I say that, keeping in mind not everyone will agree since tastes very. Everything from service to atmosphere to food is great. I have been to Trattoria many times and always had a great time and great meal."}
{"text":"well, where to start? we visited Trattoria Gardens for my birthday a couple weeks ago. there were five of us and we got seated in the bar. not bad, but not great either. we ordered the calamari which to say it was disgusting is an understatement. barely any calamari, and lots of battered pepper rings. I ordered pasta with garlic and olive oil sauce. I asked if I could have saut√©ed veggies on it, was told yes, ended up with a plate full of cauliflower. I told the waitress and all,I got was a shrug. I ended up calling to explain what happened  with the calamari and my dish, was told \"oh so sorry, you'll receive something in the mail\". well, obviously, their promises are as lousy as their pasta as we've received nothing. It's been two weeks. will never go back, lots of other Italian restaurants in Cleveland. too bad they could care less how they treat their customers. Sue Z."}
{"text":"Food was good, parking attendant was a rude creep.  I parked my car and he demanded a tip.  He made it nearly impossible for me to maneuver around the other vehicles to leave.  He yelled at me and said I should have backed in even though I parked the way he requested.   Dont park in the lot for the restaurant.  Save the trouble and park on the street."}
{"text":"Food was okay( have had much better on the Hill though) but the service really could have been a lot better. Doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a truly authentic Italian - American eatery. If you're looking for the Olive Garden, go elsewhere. Everything here is incredibly fresh, homemade, created with care, and delicious. The fresh Italian bread and tomatoes that come with it are fantastic. I had heard from multiple people that their Eggplant Parmesan was amazing. Whereas, eggplant is not something I personally enjoy, my dining companion absolutely loved it.  It looked great, and I almost asked to taste it, but she was in such a delirious feeding frenzy, but I was afraid I would be bitten if I tried to steal a bite. I had the Chicken Piccata, which was also tasty.  Also, the portions were large, and I felt that the prices were fair considering how fresh and the size of everything.  Make sure to not skip dessert! They have Tiramisu that is by far the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Disappointing... My husband and I came to Trattoria for our anniversary dinner. It was just all around boring. It was busy but we were seated within 10 minutes and they have a free valet service, fancy. The food was just bland and uninspired. We split the antipasto salad, I had chicken Marsala and he had the lasagna. Everything was just okay. The lasagna was mostly layer after layer of pasta with little in between. We each got a side, Potatoes or Pasta. The potatoes were well cooked but with no seasoning, served with green onions sprinkled on top- perhaps they should have cooked them together for some flavor? The pasta sauce tasted like Ragu, blech. We'll have to check out some other places in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Lukewarm bread, bland fettuccine alfredo, and a waitress that disappeared when it was time to get the check. Polite staff couldn't make up for all the missteps."}
{"text":"Thirty years of superb quality. Tonite itried something new from my standard marsala...veal scaloppini. Unbelievable cream wine butter sauce so rich. Dad had the lamb chops with a marsala type caper sauce loaded with artichokes. I am not kidding when I say this..some of the most beautiful thick chops I have seen and tasted. And mom and did get eggplant parm in which I do believe heaven on earth exists. This is quintessential murray hill dining. Classic old school...no pomp just great family low key dining. DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE. oh and the red sauce has that mamma italia home made shiny cast that only the best sauce has."}
{"text":"My date and I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Trattoria.  We made a reservation for 6 PM on a Saturday evening.  Parked for $3 at the nearby lot next to the new RTA station that is currently under construction and walked over.  We were seated within five minutes of arriving.  The place is very cozy, as most guests are seated in a single room.  Our server was very friendly and knew the menu backwards and front.  We each got chicken parmagiana and it was fantastic.  For dessert we had tiramisu which was absolutely out of this world.  Overall, Trattoria is a tremendous place to eat with very reasonable prices and a wonderful atmosphere.  An excellent way to spend the night in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My first visit to Little Italy and to Trattoria. I met some local friends here who said it was excellent. I was not disappointed.  On my first visit to any Italian restaurant, I like to get spaghetti with marinara. This simplest of Italian meals is the most revealing. I find that most marinara dissolves into a watery liquid on first contact with the pasta. A good gravy, however, holds its consistency and flavor. That is what Trattoria delivered: an excellent gravy. It was full of tomato, garlic, and olive oil flavor. Home cooks mistakenly believe that \"extra virgin\" olive oil must be the best to use for everything. This is why their marinara isn't a gravy, it's a juice. The chef here knows her/his business and uses a heavier olive oil (but not too much) to hold the sauce together and bind in the tomatoes.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Trattoria was a staple of mine when I lived on the East Side.  I haven't been in awhile but I assume it hasn't changed (as very little does in Little Italy).  GOOD STUFF:  Great Italian food, huge portions, fairly inexpensive.  I always got the chicken parm and it was really good and big (enough for two or a full lunch the next day).  BAD STUFF:  Not exactly fine dining but clean.  Has a parking lot in back but its often full...then your stuck looking for parking in little italy...woof.  PRICE:  About 50$ for two with bottle cheap wine.  OVERALL:  Great place in little italy....try the chicken parm...yum."}
{"text":"Y-U-M-M-Y.  There's a commercial for an Italian Chain Restaurant where a family goes to a Restaurant, everyone orders a different dish & they share. You know, when you're here, your family?  Well, this is what my Wife, Brother & Sis-in-Law did...when my Wife took a bite of her dish and Googled a recipe so we could remake the dish next time we make pasta I guess that says enough.   Staff was friendly, fast & excellent.  Nice place to sit, talk and eat great food.  I had lasagna, lots of sauce, excellent.   I can't say the next time in Cleveland I'll come back...Cleveland is a great Foodie-ville but I'd like to come here every week if I could."}
{"text":"Great family style atmosphere, not so great for date night. Our waitress was nice enough to let us sample our wines before purchasing the glass. We loved the Pasta Arrabiata! Also tried the Lasagna but it was a little too cheesy for my taste. Great place in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"Had 10 of us, made reservation on Thursday.  The food was fantastic, as usual.  Everything is homemade, as usual.  Their Tiramisu was home made and absolutely outstanding.  The Gnocchi was, as usual, house made and as close to my Grandmothers as I can get any longer.  I can't believe that they even serve it as a dinner, it is so labor intensive.  There wasn't a single member of our party that didn't LOVE their meal.  My husband and I have been going to this restaurant every time we get to Cleveland for 27 years.  It has been family owned for over 37 years.  It isn't dressy and as I looked around it was easy to see that most of the people eating there were regulars.  We never miss an opportunity to go to this restaurant when in the Cleveland area and will continue to do so as long as it is this good every time.  We have NEVER been disappointed by the food or service.  It is laid back, casual, definitely not dressy and feels like coming home.  I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves good classic Italian food.  It is, after all, in the heart of Little Italy."}
{"text":"Great food and very courteous staff. I was surprised they took a 16 person reservation on a Saturday night and they were very accommodating. Also love the wine carafes that are only $20!"}
{"text":"I haven't really had a bad experience here.  There was one time when there was a seating issue outside and the waitstaff seemed to have difficulty keeping up with things.  But, other than that, great calamari, spinach ravioli, and lasagna as far as I'm concerned! I also recently had a great time at the bar in the front. Our bartender was cute and hilarious; quite a lady! The prices are a little steep if you're looking for an amazing dish, but it IS tasty. The drink prices didn't seem too bad, though.   Overall, I'm not opposed to returning, especially because it is nice and more my style than any other Little Italy sit-down-and-get-served joint and the atmosphere is enjoyable."}
{"text":"Always make this our first stop when visiting the Feast.  Had the cavatelli and meatball- they have an excellent red sauce with fresh basil.  My daughter likes the fried mozzarella and we also get the stuffed peppers with sausage...these are hot! Whether you're at the Feast or looking for a great place for a family dinner, stop in for some great Italian fare...ciao!"}
{"text":"Let me 1st start saying that I am from New York City little Italy in the bronx.born and raised.... I am a chef so I know I can be very picky... BUT....  I was so disappointed with all the dishs we ordered we ordered the calamri When it came I already knew that it was frozen it probably came in a bag and put in a fryer..  they also put the sauce on top of the calamri which everyone should know is a NO...NO.. It will make everything Soggy why fry it then....  We ordered 4 dishes the chicken parm the veal parm spaghetti and meatballs and a pizza Everything except the pizza tasted like it was pre made and frozen for faster service  The establishment was pretty full and it looks like it accommodates large groups of people"}
{"text":"The Best Italian food I've had ever! Definitely the one to go to in Little Italy.  I have tried many of the others and they are not as good and prices are much more. The linguine and meatballs are fabulous! Save room for tiramasu for dessert for sure!"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd night in Cleveland and we wish we'd found this restaurant the first night. The food was fantastic and the prices were much more reasonable than other places we'd been to. There were 3 of us and we each had a pasta dish, all of which was perfectly cooked and very tasty. The service was very good, wines by the glass were good and reasonably priced, and we enjoyed eating out on their back patio. I highly recommend the Trattoria!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible.  The mussels were not fresh, and in the worst white sauce I've ever had.  Big undercooked pieces of garlic were everywhere, the liquid itself was oily, and incredibly under salted.  The salad looked like it came from a super market salad bar.  The eggplant Parmesan was a huge portion, but unfortunately soggy.  No reason to go here with all the other restaurants around."}
{"text":"Decent place. A good restaurant if you want your ravioli or chicken parmesan without pretense and extra cost associated with it. White cloth napkins, but a little more casual.  None of the wines by the glass was more than $7. That's a beautiful thing.   Attentive service.   Parking is the same for most of the restaurants on the street. Park in a paid parking lot somewhere or hope to get a spot on the street."}
{"text":"Delicious! Little Italy here in Cleveland is a must. We followed the suggestions on Yelp and tried this place and are so glad we did."}
{"text":"Dear Little Italy,   I officially give up.  I have eaten myself to death up and down Mayfield Rd in search of a *good* Italian restaurant that makes a great tomato sauce.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) I had high hopes for Trattoria on the Hill.  The cavatelli with extra tomato sauce was just plain mediocre.  So there you have it.  I'm officially done with settling for mediocre Italian in what is reported to be the most authentic Italian neighborhood in Cleveland.   Sadly,  Jen"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for dinner. I had a rough week at work and craving carbs and booze. I got exactly what i wanted. Had a smortini and citrus crush martini I told you I wanted booze.  Bread was serviced that was piping hot with a crispy crust and soft gluteny inside. Fantastic. But I tried not ot eat to much of it or it would soak up my martinis and kill my buzz. I ordered Linguini with scallops, mushrooms and pesto however I don't like scallops so had they switched out for shrimp. They had no problem accommodating.It was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would of changed was they left the tails on. I hate it when they do this! Sure other people argue they are edible. No they are hard exoskeletons of a sea creature, I don't want to eat the hard, ass end rudder of a sea creature. Other than that it was great. Drank a great red wine with dinner... yay booze and carbs! Boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his lasagna. We got the tiramisu to go so we could sit on the couch for the rest of the night with more wine for no pants time and a few episodes of Game of Thrones. The evening was a success! The food was great, the drinks were wonderful, and the server was attentive and helpful. The restaurant was very clean, classy, and well lit. I loved the decor."}
{"text":"High-quality, no-nonsense Italian-American food, with a ton of local charm. I had an enormous plate of linguine with a tasty red sauce for $8. Hard to argue there. If Nicole or Chris is there, you'll be taken care of."}
{"text":"Service good, food below average for the price point.  $15+ for the specialty of the house of gnocchi and shrimp.  There were only 4 tiny shrimp and too much of a very thin sauce.  Another member of my party had the same thing and had only 3 tiny shrimp.  Yet another had 10.  Mozzarella sticks arrived lukewarm and over-breaded.  We won't be back and will go somewhere else next time so we can then walk to Presti's, which made the trip from the west side worth it."}
{"text":"The only redeeming feature of Trattoria is that the food is decent.  My experience there was absurd, to say the least.  After putting in an order for an appetizer, our waitress vanished.  After about 20 minutes, we started trying to flag someone down to refill our drinks and bread, which took us 5 minutes.  Turns out the order had somehow \"never been put in.\"  Mind you, it wasn't busy at all.  So we wait, have our meal, which was decent.  Then, a different waitress takes our check, and in a few minutes comes out with the manager-turns out they charged us $444.28 instead of $44.28.  I was using a debit card, and the manager assured me I wouldn't get hit with an overdraft fee or anything of the sort, because the credit should go through at the same time as the debit.  No offer to compensate us for this mistake or for the disappearing watiress from earlier.  Turns out I did get an overdraft fee, which means I had to go to the bank where I opened my account to contest it.  Thankfully they refunded it.  With so many other options in the area, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely NOT fine dining but the food was GREAT! I had the eggplant Parmesan and instead of spaghetti on the side, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo. The calamari was good, the staff was friendly and everyone in our group was happy and full by the time of our departure. The place needs a much needed face lift and looks kinda like one of those restaurants our of kitchen nightmares, but the food tasted fresh and good and that's what matters...oh, and they need bigger martini glasses."}
{"text":"How can you tell if a restaurant is good or not?  Order the simplest thing on the menu and try it.  Well my mother and I did just that and we both loved it.  My father pretty much hates Italian food yet still found something that he liked.  Very cool that you can pick potatoes as a side too.  Not everyone loves pasta.  The old Italian-American guy complaining about the long line for table was funny too.        Yelpers who ordered seafood and complained about it:  Why on Earth would you order seafood in a land locked state and expect it to be fresh!?  This isn't Vegas.  Casinos aren't even legal here.  You really think a mom & pop place in Ohio is going to pay to ship fresh seafood on dry ice?"}
{"text":"Service: 9/10 Food: 4/10  Timeliness: 8/10  Taste: 5/10   I went to dinner with three other friends on Valentine's Day and it was definitely a nice environment. However, the food itself could've been much better. I got chicken piccata with a side of roasted potatoes (which were great). But, the chicken piccata sauce was so thick and buttery and I couldn't eat much of it. I could also see the sauce getting hard and starting to look like plastic throughout the night. I wish it had less sauce or I wish the sauce could've been less buttery/more liquid-y.   Server was good. He provided us with the bread basket multiple times (we really worked him ;))"}
{"text":"I wish that it was possible to rate in different categories.  The food was great... 4 stars.   The ambience, not so much... 2 stars."}
{"text":"Very disappointing dinner. My salad was wilted and the gnocchi dish that the waiter said was the \"house speciality\" was not good. My husband is not a picky lasagna eater and he did not like the meat sauce on his lasagna. We will definitely be trying another place in Little Italy, but not returning to this place."}
{"text":"The absolute best eggplant parmesan I have ever had in my life. It comes as a huge rectangle slice completely covered in their marinara sauce. You can see the layers when you cut into it, and every bite completely melts in your mouth. It's not pricey at all, and you'll have more than enough for a second meal.  I should really just stick to that when I come here. I've tried other things and they've been pretty meh. The spinach ravioli looked like it came from a frozen pack and was just dethawed. The service gets on my nerves every time. Even during a late lunch, when there were no more than 4 other tables in the restaurant, it took 15 minutes to get menus and water, and another 15 to get bread. Absolutely ridiculous. The check came maybe 10-15 minutes after we had requested it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant brought my son who is 3. They do not have children's menu but they offer half orders for the kids the server was fantastic brought our sons meal out first so that he was able to eat"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on recommendation from one of the staff members from my hotel while on business. I was rather surprised that Cleveland had a Little Italy section; I felt like a fish out of water in a Midwest town, but stepping onto Mayfield Rd made things just a little better.  I got take-out from this restaurant that was mixed in review. I got the fried calamari, which was terrible, I'd give it 1 star if I could. They were just a bunch of barely breaded rings. It looked to cliche and half-assed for a place the locals raved about. If they thought this was good Italian, they need to visit NYC or the Hudson Valley.   Next I had the shrimp and gnocchi with vodka sauce, which was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but it was still very good. They also make their own marinara, but I'm not sure if was worth getting molested by the TSA to bring it back east."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service can be a bit slow but the food is so good. The gnocci is my favorite and maybe the best I've had. We actually had our rehearsal dinner here in the basement. Such a cool atmosphere down there and an old school italian feel. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"Second visit to Trattoria.... and same delicious result. I ordered the chicken parm with a side of alfredo linguine. Huge portions and so yummy. I had plenty to take home for another meal. My husband got the gnocci with tomato cream sauce and he loved it. Everything came out piping hot and fresh. Our waiter was attentive and did not rush our meals. I can't wait to come back to enjoy the deliciousness."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer at Trattoria's, visiting at least every other month for the past three years and placing catering orders on at least five occasions. As much as I would love to gift them a five star review, their utter lack of organization and professionalism prevents such.   Just today I stopped in for a late dinner (8pm on a Friday night), but was instructed to put my coat back on as they were closed two hours early due to a lack of business. This was stated despite a full bar and half full dining room...This has happened to me more than once- being informed the restaurant has closed hours earlier than the posted closing time. I understand that it is a family owned business that can choose its own hours, yet the unprofessionalism with which such is carried out is disappointing.   Secondly, I have placed large catering orders over the past few years as I truly believe Trattoria's food is fantastic. However, on almost every occasion I have been extremely disappointed. On one occasion, I placed my order a week before my event. Arriving day-of to pick up my order, I was informed my $400 order was not placed and the food was not yet made. Thankfully, there was sufficient time before the start of my event to wait for the food to be made. Yet no discount or compensation was offered for this clear management error. On a second and third occasion, the food was actually ready on time, but unpacking the food for the event revealed that no Parmesan, bread, or butter had been packed- all items that are \"promised\" to be included with catering orders.   Additionally, I have felt a hasty and impatient attitude from the waiting staff my past three visits. Plates are taken from you before asking if you are finished and checks are placed on the table almost right after your food is delivered. I can appreciate a desire for efficiency, yet such actions may be misconstrued as stemming from desires to \"shoo customers out.\"   Basically, I love Trattoria's but their management requires a significant reevaluation."}
{"text":"Good portions for a good price -- but not spectacular.  Friendly waitstaff and prompt seating and service brightened the edge of otherwise lacklustre performance."}
{"text":"Food: delicious! I had the special - shrimp & andouille sausage ravioli w red pepper cream sauce. The sauce is what got me.   Service: our waitress was so friendly! Very prompt in fulfilling our requests as well as entertaining with her stories! She recommended both good wine that the employees also like as well as food for our group.   Another thing is that my order got mixed up with gnocchi in the kitchen. The manager herself came out, and gave a humble & genuine apology and asked me to let her know if there's anything I would like. I happily declined, but I loved her service :) absolutely delightful. Food came out in less than 5 minutes!   Ambience: typical italian restaurant and  comfortable.  We asked to sit in the front bar room to be closer to windows. Less tables so more private as well.  Being separated from the main room did not mean we had any less service. :)   Bonus: wifi! :)   Overall: excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food, and the staff was awesome! Took the wife and daughter for lunch after the art museum and loved it. Will definitely be back soon. Had pizza and split a huge portion of chicken parm."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service. We came for dinner, enjoyed the stuffed peppers appetizer and gnocchi with shrimp and tomato cream sauce. Delicious !!! Service was perfectly timed and the atmosphere casually elegant. We will be back for sure! This is a gem in the heart of little Italy."}
{"text":"Great food and our server was great!   There was a very rude server at the end of our meal.  Someone from our party bumped her as she was walking by with a cup of bread sauce and she was completely rude about it.  She gave him a dirty look and shook her hand as if she spilt the hottest soup.  Then she just walked away shaking her head.   Made our party feel so uncomfortable.   Everyone else was great though.  Not sure we will be back since this girl works there most nights."}
{"text":"Still in search of  the best restaurant in Little Italy. I've tried 4 or 5, and this one ranks about in the middle. Food was okay, but nothing to get too excited about. The atmosphere was good, but food was expensive for only being so-so. I'd go to Anthony's instead if you're looking for great food."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Italian wedding soup, and Trattoria's version is one of the best I have had - the meatballs melted in my mouth and the broth had a lot of flavor (without being salty).  The meat ravioli was cooked perfectly, I don't like a heavy pasta shell but this was just right.  very good sauce as well.  Service was fine, busy during lunch, but the hostess came by to check on our table, which I appreciated.  Trattoria has their own parking lot behind the restaurant (access it off of 123rd. St.).  At night the parking lot has valet parking, but today at lunch we just parked ourselves, which if you have any experience parking your car in Little Italy is a fantastic selling point!  Prices are very reasonable, my ravioli was just under 10$, and I took half of it home, so that gives you an idea of portion size.  This is my go-to place for great Italian food."}
{"text":"This 2-star rating is an average between the 1 star I would give the service and the 3 stars I would give the food... Just a disappointing experience overall. We made reservations for dinner for 5:30 for my sister's birthday and were told when we arrived that they were running a few minute behind.  A few minutes turned into an hour, and we weren't seated until 6:30.  The hostess literally had no idea what was going on and told every person who came in that the manager would have to talk to them about getting seated.  It turned into a big mess.  When we finally got seated, it was another 10 minutes before we even saw a waitress, and she only came over to give us a laundry list of excuses (\"we've been busy and I have 3 tables\") before disappearing again.  The only helpful person was the woman who brought our bread and water... She was on top of her game and was incredibly friendly!  We ended up with a different waiter who also gave a dissertation about how packed it had been all day when at this point all we wanted to do was order and go home.  I got the fettuccini Alfredo for my entree and it was ok, nothing special.  I had to add several spoonfuls of cheese for it to have any flavor at all, but once I did this, it wasn't bad! The portion sizes are huge but they're just not very big on flavor.  My sister got the chicken parm and liked it, but said it definitely could have used more flavor.  The one bright spot was the cannoli... That was absolutely delicious and I would definitely recommend it!   Our experience started out poorly and never recovered, so I probably will not be frequenting this place in the future"}
{"text":"With Trattoria, you really can't go wrong; considering the location as well as the dozen or so other Italian restaurants in Little Italy, the prices here are fair, the portions generous, and the service is attentive and efficient! I've tried practically everything on the menu, and have yet to be disappointed with the quality or taste!  I recommend sitting out on the patio during the warmer months, or on colder days you can find ample seating in the retro interior, which evokes images of 1940s era d√©cor.    Every entre comes with fresh baked bread, which is served with homemade whipped garlic butter... exceptionally delicious! I usually get the spaghetti with tomato sauce, but if you like seafood the fish is equally gratifying and is prepared perfectly!  Quantity doesn't always correspond with quality, and prices often aren't justified by the serving sizes, but Trattoria checks all the boxes and leaves nothing to spare! Great authentic Italian cuisine at its best - that's how I would describe this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  We had lunch here over the weekend and hope to have the chance to come back again.  I had the chicken picatta and my husband had the gnocchi and both were outstanding.  The service was prompt and the person helping us was very friendly and attentive. The portions were generous and the prices very affordable!"}
{"text":"After hearing such excellent reviews I couldn't wait to eat here. I ordered eggplant parmesan...it was served ice cold in the middle. The waitress promptly took it to the kitchen and MICROWAVED it. What I got back.was eggplant parmesan mush too hot too eat :( to say the least this was not good eats...after being told everything was prepared fresh, from scratch, this left me wondering how long before serving, is the food actually prepared for the middle to have been ice cold.  I will not return."}
{"text":"We ended up eating here because there was literally no other parking spaces anywhere else in Little Italy except for the parking lot dedicated to this place. So we decided to check it out and were pleasantly surprised.   When we sat down they brought a basket of bread with REAL whipped butter and a delicious fresh tomato topping! We also got the Breaded Calamari as an appetizer and it was really great! You could tell it was fresh and not a single piece was rubbery! Really great! I also got the Linguine with Clam Sauce (with the white sauce) and added the fresh steamed mussels on top. Not one bite had grit in it and the mussels were perfect. The bowl was also huge, which is great since I love leftovers!   This is solid and I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"If you want to dine in Little Italy, Trattoria is the place to go. Food is as good, if not better, than all of the other restaurants there, but it's not as expensive.  Price: Cheap. Food: Absolutely delicious Signature sauce: Amazing Service: Friendly and quick Portion size: Gigantic, especially for the price!  It can get crowded, so I'd recommend making a reservation. However, I've been there several times where I'm the only one in the place and have yet to figure out the magic day of the week/time when that happens.  I love the eggplant parmigiana and have trouble branching out when I go, but everything on the menu that I've had is wonderful."}
{"text":"Near the top of the hill, just as you enter Little Italy, this is one of the few restaurants on the main strip with its own parking lot. It's mildly romantic inside (thanks to dim lighting), the waitstaff is attentive, and the food? The food is Tony-the-tiger grrrrrreat! Try the homemade gnocchi. I'm getting wistful just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Great yummy food and simply awesome desserts! This place is simply awesome! Their specials are super yummy too! Their service is great too!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! I came to the Feast of the Assumption, ordered Calamari it was frozen breaded calamari. The bread was awful. The pasta was over cooked..., the eggplant Parmesan was the WORST I have ever had and I eat it every where all over the country, it was a big piece of mushy paste. My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce, it was watery and the clams were out of a can. To top it off, they added an 18% gratuity on a check for four. Seriously, I get better Italian food at Caraba's!! Will not come back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a vegetarian friend of mine due to hunger and because it was one of the only restaurants that was open before 5. Trattoria is the kind of family style Italian restaurant that can be found anywhere and the food wasn't bad. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the accompanying sauces were neither too thick nor too thin. However it will only get two stars. The service was the worst I've ever received. It was hard to get service from our waitress at every point of the meal except when ordering where she was impatient while we looked over the menu. The other staff didn't seem that great either. They were friendly enough when chatting with each other but they rushed to and from tables with a lack of care for the customer. If you take the time to use Yelp you should take the time to find a different restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a 6:30 reservation and did not get seated until a little after 7. The place was packed and while we were waiting in the rather crammed front area (that candy machine could not be in a worse place) I was starting to get a wee-bit concerned hoping that the questionable way things were going was not going to reflect on the quality of the food. When we were finally seated at first our waiter seemed somewhat curt, but he warmed up quickly. His name is Lenny (only works on the weekends) and I have to say by the end of the meal I was a big fan of Lenny's. Before I talk about the food I will say the only problem aside from the questionable reservation policy was the noise factor. As I mentioned above the place was packed and the volume of all of these voices some at the table found difficult to deal with especially if you are trying to hear what the person sitting across from you is saying. Here's the thing though the food is so unbelievably good that nothing else mattered once the food was served. The portions are beyond generous and the food arrived at the table hot which i am really a stickler about. For an appetizer we ordered the Breaded Calamari and it is the best I have ever had (don't be shy squeeze a little lemon on it you won't be sorry). It was not at all greasy and it was perfectly cooked and what a generous portion. For my entree I had the Eggplant Parmigiano and even before digging my fork into it I understood why it was a House Specialty. The eggplant was cooked to absolute perfection and their tomato sauce is to die for. You know how some tomato sauces immediately give you heartburn well you will not experience that with this otherworldly tomato sauce. I also love how the Eggplant Parmigiano is lightly breaded so it does not feel heavy. Every one at the table loved what they ordered and trust me when I say this is a table where if people do not like something they are not afraid to say it myself included. One person even commented it was the best meal they had ever had in Murray Hill and would go back again. To be fair the person also said the noise was a problem though at this point I am not sure what could be done about that. There is a patio in the back that is enclosed in winter and open in the summer and perhaps that is quieter. I have not been to an honest to God Italian restaurant in a long time nor have I been to a restaurant in quite some time that had its own personality and did not feel like another chain until tonight. I really felt like when my family used to go to The Spaghetti Company up on Som Center when I was a kid except that the food at Trattoria Roman Gardens was so much better. If you want authentic Italian do not hesitate to come here and if you have to wait to sit down know that it is more than worth the wait. And if you're lucky maybe you'll even get Lenny as your waiter. Trust me once he warms up you could not be in better hands."}
{"text":"Cute, simple, small place. True Italian family atmosphere. We had the cheese lasagna and simple gnocchi. Both were outstanding. Table next to us had eggplant. Being vegetarians we know good stuff when we see it. We cannot wait to return to try it. Wine list was short and sweet. We bought the sauce for home and it is great. Get some if you can."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about here. The menu was ok, and the food was decent, but overly large portions. Id rather spend less on a dish and get two for a similar price. But I hated the service. I don't often talk about service if the food was excellent, but that was not the case.  So I ordered an eggplant parm appetizer and a gnocchi entree (btw, i pointed at each on the menu when I ordered to avoid confusion).  Food arrives in a timely fashion, however the waiter brought me an eggplant parm entree instead of appetizer. They brought it back and said they would make another one for me, no big deal, very professional. But while I was waiting, I looked around to get a feel for the restaurant. There was a lot of energy, loud and buzzing, but something about the waitering staff just.. put me off. I couldn't put my finger on what it was exactly, but perhaps it was the fact that there were over 10 waiters for a restaurant that only needed 5? And our waiter seemed to be trying to take care of way more tables than he could handle (while screwing over other waiters). I saw him attack large new tables that opened up to take their orders, while ignoring our table of two. It took a full 15 min to track him down! (and this was largely because other waiters/waitresses refused to help because we weren't 'their' table). Just the whole vibe of the restaurant was made uncomfortable due to the wait staffs.. competitive nature, the lack of smiles, the lack of attention. Every waiter was passive aggressively fighting each other, and no one made us feel welcome, or paid us any attention.  OH but there is an exception! If you are a regular (I saw a few tables that were given very warm welcomes as they entered - with hugs and kisses), they will give you more attention that you need. Well, guess I'll never know what that feels like..  Anyway, enough of that, on to the food. The food was fine, I tried their gnocchi and their eggplant parm (which seems to be what they are known for).   Gnocchi was decent, I've certainly had better, but it was soooo monotonous! A whole dish of just gnocchi and tomato cream sauce for $13.95. If you are gnocchi-phile, this may be the place for you, but for a dish that is composed essentially of just potato, flour, and red sauce, it is a heck of a boring dish. Throw some italian sausage, red peppers, or something! Even if that means raising the price, I'm willing to pay good money for good food.  Eggplant parm. It was delicious (largely due to their terrific red sauce). But if you ever made eggplant parm before, you would know how cheap it is to make, and I couldn't bring myself to pay $14 for an entree of eggplant, tomato, and cheese. This is not a gourmet italian restaurant, it's an italian comfort food restaurant.  As delicious it was, there was nothing special about the eggplant parm or how it was prepared, which made me reluctant to even order the appetizer for $7.95.  fyi- the eggplant for entree and appetizer or prepared differently: Entree was a tall layered type (like a lasagna), appetizer was just red sauce poured over a few eggplant slices sprinkled with cheese.  If there was one thing that this restaurant had going for them, it would be their red sauce, it had a lot of flavor, good blend of tart and sweet. I would go back if they worked on their wait staff, and I would go back for the eggplant parm. I could see this place really working out if our server was, for instance, a sweet italian grandma who took care of us and was passionate about the food. But as soon as a comfort food restaurant like this takes on this money-first persona, with waiters jumping all over each other, it turns me off, and makes it difficult for me to enjoy the food.  Overall I would say that the food is really overrated (except the eggplant parm), I've been to much much better italian restaurants where prices were only a tad more expensive. For the food itself, I would give it a 3/5. But the wait staff is what really killed the experience for me 1/5. It seems that the only tables getting attention are: 1. table of regulars 2. tables of 4+ 3. table with beautiful ladies in beautiful clothes  As I was none of the above, my service was crap  Food: B- Atmosphere: C Service: D+"}
{"text":"Restaurant was nice. Crowded before an event. Service was very friendly. We easily got in and out before our concert. Food was good. I had the scallops and linguine pesto -- it was very good. Large portions. Area to wait was very congested. Comparatively, it wasn't my favorite restaurant in Little Italy, but it was nice, and we were able to get a reservation which was very appreciated. I didn't think it was romantic or anything, but a good place to take a family."}
{"text":"I recently had my son's rehearsal dinner here and i could not have been happier.  The food was great -- good old fashioned Italian-American, red sauce kind of Italian -- and the service was outstanding. Chris, the manager (i think) was absolutely fantastic to work with. Helpful and friendly, he did everything he could to make the experience great for my guests and easy for me. I don't live in Cleveland but if i did, i'd be a regular. and if you're planning a private function i can't recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"Great patio, especially during the Feast of the Assumption in August. They do hire great bands and throw the best party in Little Italy - sure to entertain every time. Good food, but not great! Friendly service."}
{"text":"I am starting this review with the fact that I keep forgetting that Cleveland is just not Chicago or New York. I grew up here. I know that people here are not night owls. However, since moving away, and then back again, I still forget.  What restaurant closes at 8:15? Granted it was a Monday night, but 8:15??  Well, they were not technically closed... We stood in the doorway for a few minutes perplexed at how early it was yet, it seemed no a single person wanted to even look at us.  So we stood, and then finally someone came out and looked at like we belong on mars. Maybe we do.  Then every single person on staff proceded to stare and judge us. We really should have left at this point, but it was raining and we did not want to melt since people from mars do that sorta thing.  Finally someone came out and said if we ordered in the next 15 minutes we could stay. Alright we said, we can do that.  We ordered a bottle of white zin- insert mars judging all you want, we are cheap and like a cheap wine. Our waitor sighed when we asked for the wine list. Clue number 2 that we should have left when we had the chance.  We both ordered Cavetilli (Sp?). It came out particularly mushy, like it had been boiling all night... And we had to ask for parmasean cheese... I mean even Olive Garden brings the cheese with the meals come on people...  So all in all, our night ended with them turning on the bright lights in the dim restaurant. And let me tell you with half a bottle of white zin in me, I was not too pleased with that choice.   I may or may not have stolen one of the tacky BUY OUR SAUCE ITS SO GOOD! jars from a table nearby and walked out with it in my hand, just to prove that people from mars do not know societal rules."}
{"text":"Nice little Italian place in Little Italy. I got the Chicken Parm which was good overall. The chicken was a 4 out of 5, the pasta about a 2.5 out of 5. The service was incredibly friendly and polite. It isn't the fancy place in the world (not to say that is good or bad), but don't worry if you aren't wearing a suit. If someone else wanted to go here, or told me they were going here I'd be fine with it. However, since I don't frequently visit Little Italy I'll try somewhere different next time. I'd have to imagine there are better places, although this place wasn't terrible by any means."}
{"text":"Large busy Italian restaurant with huge portions. Seriously humongous portions. I ordered the eggplant parm on recommendation and it didn't disappoint. It was finely sliced eggplant piled high with a yummy tomato sauce. It came with a side of spaghetti as well! It was so much food that half the eggplant and all the spaghetti ended up untouched in a to-go box. I also loved the brushetta spread they put on the table with the bread. Service I thought was so so, because they mixed up out to go boxes, but they brought the food out fast. I'd probably go again because it was good, but I wouldn't say the food was spectacular."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant not knowing what to expect. It's a family run Italian joint so I ordered the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were gigantic, and the sauce was remarkable. It had a low price point and I would definitely go again.  The tables were very classic Italian, with a bottle of cianti on each, and actual cloth tablecloths! I love this place and would go back in a heartbeat. Good service, good food, and good oversight."}
{"text":"It's not high-end Italian, but for those of you who are just looking for some tasty Chicken Parm and some pasta, this place will definitely hit the spot. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are very big, so you shouldn't have to worry about leaving hungry. Very quick service as well. Nothing special about the atmosphere, and other than being quick the service is nothing special.  A few pointers about the food:  1) If you like gnocchi, GET IT HERE! The gnocchi at Trattoria is the best dish I've had there in many, many visits. It comes in a creamy tomato based sauce, a lot like Vodka Sauce, and the sauce alone knocks my socks off.  2) DON'T GET WINE. Again, this is nothing high-end, and as such the wines they offer have never been anything but a disappointment. Just accept that you're looking for a quicker, simpler meal, get your pasta and a diet coke and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"The food was great here. I had the crab cakes marina. Our server Mike was awesome. However they have faulty furniture and because of this my phone slipped through their couch. They refused at first to get it out. It was a big enough hole for a cold to get their arm stuck in. They claimed I may never get the phone back and asked well do you have insurance? Our server Mike finally came back over and pulled the board up and got it. So easy and the frustration could have been avoided by the woman server. Even though the food was great I'd rather have a good experience and not be meant with multiple rude servers expect Mike. Kudos for Mike for dealing with the rough streets of this restaurant."}
{"text":"The sauce here is probably the best in little italy. Easily. So you must try the lasagna or spaghetti Bolognese.  A side order with a salad is the best way to go since the side is rather large. One of only about two Little Italy eateries with their own parking. I've had good and bad service here. Overall, I am pleased with the food and the Bruschetta (pronounced broo SKET uh) sauce is a nice little touch. Great, classic location on Mayfield. The tiramisu in the glass must be a Cleveland thing. Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. All of the people dinging this place for the atmosphere are a little off base in my opinion. It's not the best, but it's not that bad. It's like an Italian restaurant should feel - down home style like you're being fed from a kitchen. The food definitely earns this place 5-stars."}
{"text":"I've lived in Little Italy for over a year and this is my favorite place on the block. The food is always good and the complementary bruschetta before your meal is to die for"}
{"text":"Have eaten at Trattoria a couple of times over the past few years. Really great food and fantastic service. Love their breaded eggplant - one of the best I've had. Also love their pizzas and pastas. Dessert's also superb, though there often isn't space for it!"}
{"text":"My visits to Trattoria have been pretty solid, but not mind-blowing. My first visit was a few years ago, and all I really remember from that experience was a very rude and kind of crazy server. I recently went back for dinner for a friend's birthday though, and the service was far better. Our server was sweet and efficient. I got the gnocchi with shrimp which was good - the portion is massive and I love the creamy tomato mushroom sauce. I've also stopped by to meet a friend for a few drinks at the bar which were yummy, and the bartender was great and really friendly. I would go back to Trattoria, but I'm in no big rush."}
{"text":"Been here alot over the past 7yrs. Loved it, but unfortunately after tonight..I think I bid farewell. Calamari (11.25) is frozen & over done. Chicken Piccata (15.25), which I've had there before, was terrible. The sauce had a film on it, but dish was luke warm. Chicken was dry & sauce had a faint lemon taste. Hubby got linguine w/ white clam sauce (11.25) I'm no expert on clam sauce so in his words, it was brothy & lacked the taste he wanted. Anyway, service was average. I guess crossword puzzles are more important than increasing your tip ;)"}
{"text":"Met some old friends for dinner.. Service was excellent. I had the sausage and mushroom pizza, and a house salad. It cam out quickly and tasted delicious"}
{"text":"The restaurant seemed empty and the staff was not attentive to seating our party. However, once we were seated the wait staff was amazing and the food was prepared fresh but fast. Also, they handled any requests or changes to a dish very well. One of my favorite spots in little Italy. Just wish it was a bit less pricey."}
{"text":"We went to Trattoria on a whim. We had been stuck inside all day and wanted to get out and just do something. We decided to walk around Little Italy and decided to get dinner here because it's more affordable than some of the other places.  Service was great - the waiter knew the menu items and was honest when he had not tried some of the food.  I enjoyed the bread and the oil or tomato topping that came along with it (I can't remember!).  I ordered the primavera pasta with red sauce.  It was tasty and the portion was HUGE.  I think I got three meals out of that plate.  It just wasn't anything to rave about in my opinion.  I appreciate the family atmosphere and just being in Little Italy.  I would try it again and try another dish, which may lend to a better foodie experience."}
{"text":"The best gnocchi I have ever eaten along with their Chicken Parmiagiano! Abbstanzo bene!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday for lunch with my parents. Not our first choice, but most of the restaurants were closed at lunch time. Which seems really dumb to me. In the end, we enjoyed this place a lot, so it was good. Started with fresh bread in a basket with butter. Pretty good bread. I started with a chocolate martini, which was delicious. It wasn't as full as I expected or typically get, which was too bad, but what there was of it tasted good. I got the chicken parmigiano with red potatoes as a side. The chicken parm was good, pretty big, and pretty tasty. Red potatoes were fine - came with a lot of them. My brother go the same thing with pasta on the side. The pasta was boring. My mother got spinach ravioli, which were really good. Came in a tomato sauce, a full plate of them, pretty big, and flavorful. My father got chicken marsala, which was similar - tasty, big, and good. We got tiramisu for dessert - filled a martini-like glass. There was a lot of it, it was super tasty and well-done. Loved it. I love tiramisu and am snobby about it - this was good tiramisu."}
{"text":"Had a very nice night here this past Friday at Trattoria. The eggplant parmesean was a very hefty portion, perfectly breaded and just enough on the cheese to sauce ratio.   For the table they bring as standard bread with a roma tomato- garlic spread, very delicious and unexpected.   I had the chicken marsala, fianc√© had the eggplant parm'. I thought it was very good but not great like the eggplant. I think my chicken marsala standards are a little high after working in an Italian catering company in high school (I got paid in chicken marsala).  I got a side salad in place of linguini and red sauce, the italian dressing was homemade and had a good amount of zest.  The atmosphere was good, a little close seat wise but I think that's kind of the charm of little Italy in a way.   didn't have any dessert but they looked like HUGE pieces of cake and will try that next time.  The prices were very reasonable too as a bonus. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"After touring Case Western, my daughter and I were craving Italian and we randomly selected this place. So glad we did. The waiter said the eggplant parmigiana was a favorite and he was right. It was an ample portion and I kept checking if was the lasagna instead. Delicious!"}
{"text":"i thought the pizza was really good. yeah, cleveland is most DEFinitely not chicago or NY... but maybe after going to all these so-so places in CLE my standards - for that day at least - lowered a bit.  in any case, i think it might be safe to say that this is one of the better restaurants in cleveland's little italy...for pizza at least!"}
{"text":"Good food. Breads really good. I wish they gave more food. I want to be wobbling out of there. But seriously, they are decent portions. Best Italian place in Little Italy so far."}
{"text":"Sat outside on a very pleasant day.  Menu is not extensive, but good.  Nice complementary Italian bread is fresh.  Mussels are a nice appetizer.  Salads tasty, especially with house Italian dressing.  Gnocchi is excellent.  Ordering with shrimp adds protein, but not much else.  Would probably order without.  Wine list is short and sweet.  Desserts are good.  Tiramisu served in a parfait glass, but tasty.  Service is spotty.  Our server was slow, but nearby server was very active.  Portion size is generous for entrees.  You will be taking food home.  Overall good, but not excellent.  Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Met up with our son and daughter-in-law for dinner. Chicken parm, alfredo, pizza, ravioli all very good. Service was efficient and friendly and prices were moderate. The only negative was the noise. Ridiculously loud... and the tables jammed in a bit. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"My mother and father met and fell in love in Cleveland and all of her family is still there and we go an visit them at Thanksgiving every year. The Trattoria is the place we all want to go for dinner on the Friday after Thanksgiving (you would think we would all be super stuffed but no).   This place is amazing and everything is crazy delicious. yes it is a little bit more money but for the quality and experience it is totally worth it. We always try to get this giant booth in the back room which makes you feel like you are in the Godfather movies. The waiters all used to be super handsome young men, but that has changed a little bit no matter though the service is always flawless and they always manage to accommodate our giant, crazy family.   If you are able to not fill up on their amazing fresh bread, salted butter and delicious bruschetta then their apps like the calamari are the perfect starter, I have also had their antipasto salad to start before as well which is great. All of their pasta dishes are fresh and amazing and you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu but I would advise you to save room for dessert because the tiramisu there is to die for. This is not a random Wednesday night place but the perfect place to go and splurge on great wine and food with family and friends.   I cannot wait until I can go back!"}
{"text":"I don't know how the ratings for this place are so high! We went in about 2:30pm, it took the server 10-15 minutes to come over to even greet us,  needless to say, we already had figured out our drinks and entire order. We ordered a meatball sub and a breaded chicken sandwich. The discription doesn't say that it comes with anything, but yet, it came with some weird, smelly, gross olive salad, thing (both my husband and I can't stand olives, so it grossed us out). The olives gave a nasty taste to my already dry sandwich (the chicken was dry, overcooked and flavorless). My husband's meatball sub had NO cheese! Never heard of an Italian restaurant not putting cheese on a meatball sub. There was a light dusting of sauce, so his sandwich was also dry. When he told the waiter, he thought there would be cheese, the waiter said, \"oh, you wanted cheese?\" There was one bite left, too late buddy!  I think the only thing that was remotely Italian in that place, was the olive thing, also the one thing we could have done without! Even the atmosphere was bland! By the way, it wasn't busy, there were only 2 other tables occupied,  when we walked in. Also, @ 2:30pm, lunchtime, we paid (nor including tip) $45, for 2 sandwiches, 1 with fries, 1 with a salad, 2 flavored ice teas, and 5 mozzarella sticks. Kind of pricey!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed the last night when we went here. Daughter ordered half order of the fettuccini alfredo the bowl was so full you it was hard to eat, it would be better in a bigger bowl so that you can have space for the fettuccini, she barely ate, I tried and was not impressed we did not even take this home. I had the cavatelli with meatsauce, not impressed either not the best tasting, have had better down the street. I hope the next time we go here it has improved."}
{"text":"I took an out of town guest here to experience a little bit of the Little Italy neighborhood in Cleveland, and we enjoyed every bit from beginning to end.  The bread basket was deliciously fresh with nice soft Italian bread with a delightfully chewy crust.  It was served with bruschetta that was out of this world fresh for being November in Cleveland.  For our main meal, we both got the Veal Parmagiano.  The veal was fork tender and lightly breaded with perfectly seasoned breadcrumbs and flour.  It was served with a very generous side of linguine with marinara sauce.  A generous serving of mozzarella was melted over the veal.  My only suggestion for improvement would have been homemade or fresh pasta.  We left with very full bellies and a very fair bill.  The ambiance is definitely not worth the visit, but the food definitely is."}
{"text":"This was the very first establishment I ate at after moving to Cleveland from Cincinnati. Took my whole family here because we are all full blooded Italians and I wanted them to see Little Italy.    This particular dining experience was so-so. The service was pretty fast (unless you count the wait time before we got seated) despite being slammed wall to wall with people. I got the lasagna here and it was edible but nothing remarkable I couldn't finish it and didn't take the leftovers.  My parents got veal parm and spaghetti and meatballs. Again a so-so experience for them. We can cook better than that and have also had much better Italian dining experiences elsewhere. The food was way overpriced so I'm guessing people primarily pay for the \"feeling\" of little italy when they go there rather than the food. None of us risked desert we walked to the bakery down the street which was awesome."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place.  Food and atmosphere was awesome.  Raspberry Cheesecake is a must."}
{"text":"We met for dinner with friends. We were seated right away. They brought water and bread shortly thereafter. The meat lasagna, spaghetti with mushrooms and meat and cheese ravioli all were excellent. They have Great Lakes Dortmunder on draft.  Great restaurant and an awesome bar. You can stop in for just drinks and desert. There is always cappuccino and pastries down the street a Presti's. Wow!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in Little Italy.  My daughter had the chicken piccata and I had the gnocchi. Both were delicious. Portions were sizable and a great value."}
{"text":"good place for summer days, food is good and prices ok"}
{"text":"Food was good, but it was clearly microwaved.  Portion sizes are huge, but that's typical in many family-friendly Italian restaurants.  Last time I was there, I had the gnocci, which was fine, but nothing the specials.  The potatoes my dad ordered were far too hot (microwaved), and just didn't have much flavor.  But the service is good, the food is generally fine, and it's a cozy spot in Little Italy to have a meal."}
{"text":"This review is for the Eggplant Parmesan only. This is the best Eggplant in the entire world! Obviously that sound silly, but I have had this dish in many US restaurants and in Italy and it is best here, hands down. Trattoria marinates their eggplant. The same marinated eggplant used for an appetizer is used for this entree and it is wonderful and the portions are huge.  I don't mean to suggest that there other food is not good, it is, but it is not as stellar as the eggplant. I live neat little Itally, so it is easy for me to eat there often. Each restaurant has a dish or two that it is known for and those are real stand outs. beyond that the food is \"pretty good\" at most places, but can be as bad as \"ok\". At others. So I suggest you ask around and order what each restaurant is known for. This way your Little Italy experience will always be a good one."}
{"text":"Just okay.. Very slow service, over priced, food was subpar. Overall, a disappointing experience.. With all the great restaurants in Little Italy, I can say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck restaraunt in Little Italy.    The staff is very friendly and accomodating.    ***The free bread, butter and tomato spreaid is awesome***  ***The best dishes are their gnocchi and eggplant parmeasan***"}
{"text":"Had dinner here a little less than two weeks ago. Have been here several times before but it has been a couple of years.  A quiet Thursday night because there had been rain in the area a few hours previous. they have parking right behind the restaurant which was a breeze on this quiet Thursday night and they have a back entrance.  The loaf of bread with a generous portion of bruschetta and a cup of butter was a great start. I had the chicken marsala which was great tasty sauce with fresh mushrooms and instead of pasta on the side I had the rosemary and oregano roasted potatoes which were split quarters of red bliss potatoes perfectly done maybe the best I have ever had anywhere.   Had a Peroni beer which was a perfect accompaniment to the meal service was absolutely excellent. the dining room is Olde world Italian."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in Little Italy.  It's a down home Italian restaurant with friendly service and huge portions.  You won't leave hungry.  Their marinara sauce is delicious.  You should definitely try the lasagna and the eggplant parmesan.  They are amazing."}
{"text":"I was pretty unimpressed by Trattoria.  As a restaurant in Little Italy, I expected more than just regular pasta.  We split the shrimp/gnocchi and linguine pasta dishes.  While the pasta was cooked well, the sauces were flavorful, and everything came in huge portions, there wasn't anything special about Trattoria's food that couldn't be replicated at home.  The menu is fairly limited and the food is pretty plain.  Service was okay, but relatively slow and unattentive.  I don't plan on coming back -- there's definitely way better Italian restaurants in Little Italy and Cleveland as a whole."}
{"text":"Chose trattoria  for a birthday dinner did not care for it at all we ordered calamari and it was not fresh calamari that most authentic Italian restaurants serve it was the frozen type I don't think anything was fresh the eggplant we both ordered was swimming in sauce and was a layered mushy uncooked mess the service was poor as well we could have used more than one glass of water to wash down the disgusting food the only good thing was the fresh bread therefore I am giving a thumbs down"}
{"text":"So, this is a mixed review. The service was very good but it took a long time to get my food. So my daughter ate before the rest of us did because her pizza was ready and the rest of our food was not. By the way, the pizza was very good.   The veal parmigiana was very good and a great portion of pasta on the side. The sauce was fresh and good.   The veal scallopini was tender, but drowning in sauce that tasted like a pound of butter was dropped in. I'm Italian, I've never had a drowning veal before. I actually had to mix the gravy around with my fork to see if there were pieces of veal in there.   2.5 stars."}
{"text":"We went to Trattoria this past week for a rehearsal dinner.  The food was fabulous. The chicken Marsala was great and the portions were huge. My husband had linguini with meatballs, and the meatballs were to die for!  I can't wait to go back again.  I would have left five stars, but I think they were just overwhelmed by the size of our group and we had a terrible time getting drinks."}
{"text":"If I could give them less than a star I would. Food wasn't as good as usual and the rudest wait staff ever. Might never come back"}
{"text":"Great prices, AMAZING food! Valet parking, indoor and outdoor eating, friendly waitstaff.  The atmosphere is a bit lacking and outdated, but the food was absolutely amazing! I'm Italian and from the NYC area and very overly critical about Italian food, but it was great!"}
{"text":"After a day in the sun and in various watering holes around town on the Tribe's opening day, I was in desperate need of a hearty meal on my way back to the east side. We had to drive though Little Italy and hadn't been to Trattoria in quite awhile and thought we might as well give it a try.   Despite the fact that it was a Friday night, we were seated after a 10-15 minute wait. We were immediately brought a basket of bread and water. (I've always been a fan of the crusty bread and bruchetta-like tomato sauce that accompanies it. But not a big enough fan to buy a jar of it!) The dining room was noisy as always and I generally feel a little cramped with the way the tables are set up. One slip and your meal could be on the table of the patrons next to you. But I suppose that's part of the charm?   My boyfriend had the gnocchi al burro, or something similarly named. Basically it was a gnocchi in a creamy tomato sauce. He remembered the gnocchi being bigger the last time we were there, and I'd suspect that they don't make their own pasta. (but I could be wrong - maybe they're so good at it that it looks completely uniform) I tried the gnocchi and thought it tasted very buttery. I don't like buttery tomatoes, so I wasn't a fan. But my eggplant parm was a lot better. Eggplant can be hit or miss (hello, funky, tough eggplant!), but the slab I had was perfectly cooked and slathered in sauce and cheese. To be honest, I could have eaten just about anything at that particular moment because I was so hungry, but I still think my meal was pretty good.   Overall, I think Trattoria is a decent place to go for a decent Italian meal. Nothing spectacular or worth making the drive for, but it will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Cleveland's Little Italy. I've been here multiple times with friends and family, in fact my mom always insists that we go because their tomato basil spaghetti sauce (which is also sold by the jar) reminds her of her great aunt's homemade sauce. I've never been disappointed with a meal here. Tip: if you go for the spaghetti, you can choose to have one meat ball and one Italian sausage instead of only picking one of the two.  The house red wine is excellent, also!"}
{"text":"Loved my pasta, sauce was not overwhelming. I hate pasta that is swimming in sauce. And most importantly the bread was great. When you walk in the desserts are right there,I was tempted to skip food and do dessert. I think i need to return for a martini and dessert."}
{"text":"I've dined here a number if times over the years and seem to have a different experience everytime.  The one constant is the portion size, they always give you plenty of food.  However, the food and service quality can be hit or miss.  On the last visit, my wife and I split the Caesar salad, which didn't  look or taste anything like a Caesar salad (photo attached); split the calamari appetizer which was tender and cooked just right!; I had the linguini and clams for my entree and it was good, but nothing special;  my wife had the eggplant parmesan which she enjoyed; my one sons steak was a little to charred on one side, but my other son seemed to enjoy his pizza and mussels.  Good but very hit or miss. I expect better on the \"Hill\""}
{"text":"Went today after church for family reunion  Ordered the chicken marsala; had a weird taste. Can't really put my finger on it Husband said he could see the sheen of oil on top, maybe old oil. We had a very large party so service was slow."}
{"text":"In Brazil Italian food have different tastes. The pasta ravioli isn't so thick, and the lasagna has filling in all the \"layers\". The food taste was good, and the portions as always were huge."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood after visiting the Cleveland Botanical Gardens over Thanksgiving weekend.  There are so many options, but the group I was with had good things to say about Trattoria.  Our party of four plus a baby was seated immediately.  We were served with complimentary bread and butter.  We started with a bottle of wine, and it was brought out right away.  The server was great about when one of my friends asked questions about vegan options.  They were able to accommodate her, and the pasta came out cheese free.  I ordered the shrimp and gnocchi trattoria.  The sauce was lacking a little flavor, so I added some crushed red pepper and that was just the thing it needed.  I normally can finish an entire entree, but the portions were so huge, I took more than half home.  The flavor of the dish really came out in the next days leftovers."}
{"text":"EHHHHHHHHHHH. Came here on a Thursday night for a date (so unfortunately, I was too self conscience to take photos). Considering I am a huge fan of at least one restaurant in Little Italy, I was convinced I'd love surrounding restaurants. Whoops, guess I was wrong.  I must state that this place was not horrible. I repeat, NOT HORRIBLE. It just was not taste bud exploding. Or mind numbing-ly amazing. Or to die for delicious. It just tasted like something I could make in my kitchen with a bottle of pink sauce from Heinen's. But I feel bad saying that :( Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish. By the way, I had the gnocchi with shrimp.  Final say: I'd rather go to a different restaurant in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Good solid Italian food Great lunch specials, especially the sausage sandwich I recommend the eggplant parmesan as well Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Meatball sub sandwich. Sausage sub sandwich with peppers & onions, traditional calmata olives and a garden salad at our table. Delicioso! The pasta dishes at next table over also look wonderful.  The place is packed, noisy with friendly chatter. Italian chatter is loud! Service is prompt, efficient. Don't expect something it's not. This is a down home traditional Italian place"}
{"text":"Italian family dining. Start off with wedding soup and then go in any direction you care to... you'll have a real Italian dining experience in a friendly environment. Portions: Large."}
{"text":"Bar sucks Ordered martini got grey goose glass. Waiter doesnt understand english but he is white lol Tried to order ravioli with choice of meat but only meat is beef, tried to ask waiter if lobster was available.. he was shocked as he heard word lobster for first time. Next time stay out go to olive garden! :)"}
{"text":"Well, I was looking for a place that was relaxed in that neighborhood, had character, some parking and good food.  Did I mention it had to be open for lunch and not break the bank?  Well, Trattoria on the Hill met all the criteria. The service was prompt and we did not feel rushed at all.  The portion side was anything but lunch--come hungry---and the sauce is really the highlight and I would stick with that.  Go for a salad followed by some type of pasta sauce and maybe a protein and you will be pleased.  Remember they also have a patio out back but it was too hot to use when I visited.  Definitely a return visit soon."}
{"text":"The average rating of stars pretty much meets my experience, about a three and a half.  Food was good, not worth driving from the north side of Medina county (Santa Susso's on 18 is better).  Food was good, decent sized portion.  Dining area is nothing to shout at, but the bar area is a little nicer, we should have asked to eat in there.  Definitely felt rushed to get out the door and the manager on staff did end up telling us that he was in need for our table and invited us to come into the bar and let him buy us wine and drinks.  For an average night out, this is a good option, we would do it again."}
{"text":"I am complete shock.  I've been here a few times but always stuck with generic pasta dishes.  This time, we had the kid with us-who is picky.  Now, please understand that I took a risk this time and ordered something I would never order in Little Italy. I ordered steak! It was amazing! The sirloin arrived seasoned, cooked medium-well *perfectly*.  It was very tender and I could cut it with my fork alone.  I sliced it and gave over half to my six year old, and she LOVED it.  Then she wanted even more.  The way the Chef seasoned it and prepared it reminded me of how my Papa seasoned and cooked food.  Like something right out of your own home.  Not salty nor over-done, nor oily, nor drowned in butter; this steak made me swoon.  At an Italian place!  I'm being serious...I was just as surprised; this steak was so good, it needed no toppings nor b√©arnaise.  The only thing was that it should have arrived with a steamed or baked vegetable instead of fried onion rings and a side of spaghetti.  The onion rings were superb, but I prefer broccoli or un fried veggies with my meat.  I didn't care for the spaghetti sauce, but the bread they serve here is good.  Wine prices aren't bad, either.  The service from the waitstaff was great, too, although I must admit I was too distracted by the food!   Oh yeah, one more thing-I didn't see a kids menu, although that could be because I wanted to split the steak with my child. Anyway, do yourself a favor and order the steak (or the salmon, which is also divine here, but that's another essay!)"}
{"text":"Food was ok/decent. Atmosphere was nice, we sat on back patio.  Very big portions.  Service was slow but waiter acknowledged it and was apologetic.  Would be willing to go back and try again when in area.  Also parking attendant was weird to say the least, was bugging me for a tip while I was waiting for my husband to come out.  Came up to my window looking for tip!"}
{"text":"i ordered 3 things. 1) garden salad: nothing special. same salad  you would get at a diner. it was the best thing i had. 2) calamari: not good at all. i've had better pretty much anywhere. 3: linguini with clam sauce and mussels. overcooked linguini, mussels were a little off."}
{"text":"Come here to get my Italian-food \"fix,\" whenever I visit Cleveland, and Trattoria Roman Gardens never disappoints. Of course, while I always begin with a glass of Chianti, while carefully studying the menu, I end up getting the same thing every visit:  Eggplant Parmigiano (think that's how it's spelled on their menu). Regardless of how they spell it, it's \"molto bene.\" Delicious!  What I call \"mommy food\" because - being Italian - it takes me back.  Part of the reason it's so good is their homemade sauce - also delicious (and there's plenty of it!). Homestyle Red Sauce (aka as Red Gravy or SUGU to Italians) is such a personal experience but theirs hits the mark and there's no doubt it didn't come out of a jar or can! Only reason I gave 4 stars? Not sure, but probably because it could be a little better in some areas (but not the eggplant or red sauce). That's not a criticism; if your looking for solid, homestyle, unpretentious Italian food, this is the place. Go. Mangia. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal here with my daughter during a November visit to Cleveland. It was mid-afternoon and I was surprised at how full the restaurant was. We were lucky enough to be seated immediately and the restaurant continued to fill up as we ate. Soon, people were waiting for a seat. We learned why. We were given delicious bread and dipping sauce to start. My daughter said her spinach ravioli meal was very tasty but we both raved about my gnocchi al burro. Gnocchi is a childhood favorite of mine ever since I watched a friend of the family hand make the little dumplings. The pasta was incredibly fresh and the sauce was exquisite. The serving was very generous so we were lucky enough to enjoy it again as a late night snack, along with the extra tub of the dipping sauce the server gave us to enjoy with our leftover bread. Our service was quick. The restaurant itself was charming - an open dining area full of happy chatter, warm lighting and a classic black and white floor. We will return when next in Cleveland."}
{"text":"So/so spot in Cleveland's Little Italy. Great Italian wedding soup. All of the entrees I've had so far have been mediocre compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. I gave three stars for the fact the service is always great and quick anytime I have gone!"}
{"text":"Shared a 19$ bottle of Chianti, which was good. Had the linguini pesto with scallops and mushrooms. Great food and service with good service. Would def recommend it"}
{"text":"Whoa, had lunch there on Tuesday, 8 of us ..Excellent .. Bravo.. food very well prepared,  great service ...all the lunches served together (nice going).. nice and clean old school atmosphere (godfather throwback)... we're from Buffalo so we know good Italian and this is GOOD Italian .. pasta done right ..we had veal, chicken and lasagna dishes ..got quiet at the table when the food appeared, everyone eating, just hands moving ...... our cousins brought us there and we will be back anytime we are anywhere near Cleveland....addio"}
{"text":"You've got to love the historic Trattoria in Little Italy. It's been here forever. I remember coming in as a kid with my Grandfather. While it's become a little less formal over the years, the food, wine and desserts don't disappoint. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. The veal parm is excellent, as is the house Chianti. Don't forget to checkout the dessert case before sitting down so you know what to save room for!"}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch with a colleague. We needed a quick lunch and this place didn't disappoint. We were not rushed out the door and the service was attentive. Our water was always full!  I had the chicken parmigiana with the side of pasta and tomato basil sauce. The chicken was not over cooked and there was a perfect amount of breading.  My colleague had the meat filled ravioli and she said that it was a good dish also. In addition to the food the inside of the restaurant is very quaint and adds to the positive experience. I really want to come back for dinner when the weather is warmer!"}
{"text":"I rate all my Italian food based on their bread and ravioli. Italian bread was good and it came with butter, not olive oil. I enjoyed the ravioli, felt it was a good portion and big pockets of cheese/beef. They have free/reserved parking in the back, which was super convenient and outdoor seating was beautiful!"}
{"text":"Was just turned away for dinner at 6:30pm on a Sunday for dinner.  The girl was eating behind the counter and said they ran out of food.   Get your act together.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Meh. Eggplant parm was mushy, my boyfriends gnocchi was pretty good. They brought our appetizer at the same time as our meals like 10 minutes after ordering them, so there was basically no point ordering an appetizer since we had no time to eat it. They asked me 3 times while I was still eating if I needed a box... they just wanted us in and out & it was obvious. Will not return given the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch. Very quick service, yummy food, free bread basket! I got the beef ravioli and my friend got the shrimp pesto pizza. The pizza was delicious, quite greasy but flavorful and very tasty. The beef ravioli was good too, pretty big ravioli and the marinara sauce was very yummy."}
{"text":"great little Italian restaurant in little Italy! The pizza is great and they have a very nice patio in the back. Try the chicken artichoke pizza!"}
{"text":"for the amount of food I get and my favorite eggplant parmesan and calamari, ill give it a four star!  I don't really like going to any of the restaurants in little Italy cuz I think they are all over rated and over priced. I had some left overs - yes I eat my friends leftovers hahaha -  from this place from a friend before and I really liked it so I decided to try it out today. we went there for lunch and I would say lunch menu is usually a little cheaper. the calamari is a must try. it came with a whole plate of food that after finished this appitizer I was already full. then I had the eggplant parmesan, still just as good as last time when I had the left over haha but I was too full to finish it. I don't know how they made it but it was fried but not oily but lots of cheese but not cheesey iono it was just really good. the marinara was a little on the salty side tho. my friend ordered the veal parmasan, which was pretty good as well. oh btw I have to comment on their bread and their butter - the bread is super soft and I LOVE their butter. its salted in a very nice way and I packed the butter and bread home too haha.   I wish the food could be cheaper tho but the amount of food I got was probably enough for 2-3 meals. if you order eggplant parmesan for dinner, it will be 15 instead of 12 because they give you an extra bowl of spaghetti."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy.  I have introduced many friends and family to it, always with positive experiences.  It can get very crowded on weekend evenings, so you need a reservation.    Since other people have mentioned it, I will too - the bread!  Fresh, presented well in a paper lined metal bowl, with the whipped butter...tells me this place knows how to make a great first impression.  Unlike other restaurants that give you hard rolls with frozen pats of butter that I have to hold in my fist for awhile so I can even spread the darned stuff!  The parking lot behind the restaurant is a BIG plus, especially on weekend nights.  They have valet service at night, at lunch you park yourself."}
{"text":"I've been to Trattoria a few times and always put off writing a review because nothing really wows me here. I'll start with some basic pros:  1) Their red tomato sauce is really excellent.  2) the pasta is always cooked perfectly al dente. 3) They have their own lot and valet in the back 4) Price is pretty consistent with Little Italy and is a good value 5) Good portion sizes 6) Great menu options  The cons: 1) Service is underwhelming. Not always bad, but never great. 2) Chicken Piccatta (one of my favorite dishes) is very bland. Did they forget the lemon? 3) Its always crowded and loud and uncomfortable in there. No matter where I sit or how large/ small my party is. I never feel like I can just come in and relax with a glass of wine and my food."}
{"text":"This is a great little authentic Italian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy. We have been here a number of times, and it never disappoints.   If you are an eggplant fan like I am, do not pass up the Eggplant Parmesan. Their version looks like a square of lasagna, and is thin layered slices of eggplant-- delicious from the first to the last bite. Planning a trip next weekend as we speak:)"}
{"text":"The Chicken Parm was pretty good. I think it was around $13. The prices were excellent. Whoever said it is overpriced is crazy. It was honestly the biggest piece of chicken that I have ever seen. I thought it was maybe even a different, larger bird. The bread and tomato/garlic spread is a real tasty treat. My friend had the Veal. I am not a huge fan of veal but the Chicken Parm was better in my opinion. I enjoyed my lunch here and will one day return!"}
{"text":"This place has huge portions which I love as a big guy. I got the chicken Alfredo and it was delicious. Prices were good but we had to wait about an hour on a Sunday evening which wasn't terrible. The bread and tomato sauce they bring out before you eat was great too. Service was a little slow so that's why I gave it 4 stars but id definitely recommend this place for some great pasta."}
{"text":"\"Ubriaco Depravazione\" stop 1.  The other diners were already sipping on some Moretti La Rossas(7%) and cocktails when i arrived. I had a LaRossa(mostly because i like Tony LaRussa). The al fresco dining experience on the last day of September was just warm enough to not require heavy coats, but cool enough to wipe away the memories of one of the most brutally hot summers ever.  I sampled yelper #*!$#!#^ 's calamari. Pretty good. I ordered the antipasto platter for us all to share. It kinda blew. Little meat and cheese and heavy on chick peas(i could go the rest of my life without ever eating a chick pea and be happy), tuna salad, eggplant, olives and leftovers from earlier diners' plates. Service was very good and interacted with our group in a fun way.   I used to eat here a lot in the 90's when i had family working here, so it was nice to go back after almost a decade absence. Can't vouch for the pasta, but it is a pleasant place for a quick app. If said apps don't suck. Very casual vibe."}
{"text":"Had a reservation and still took an hour to grab a seat.  Hostess was not the most pleasant and did not care about our waiting time.  Good was pretty good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Little Italy in general is amazing. Food was fantastic. I had the cheese ravioli and there were no complaints. Bread was a little hard to my liking but the sauce they gave u to dip it in was actually super delicious. Only down side was our waitress was slow."}
{"text":"This restaurant has three dishes that in my opinion are three of the best of its kind in the area! Their egg plant Parmesan is the best eggplant Parmesan I've ever found in my life. It is almost like eggplant lasagna. Every part of this meal is delicious and can easily serve two people. Their homemade gnocchi in vodka sauce melts in your mouth like butter. We recently stopped there and my daughter wanted their ribs, which I was surprised to see on their menu. If you like ribs that are not fatty and full of flavor these are some of the best meaty ribs I have ever tried. Their homemade salsa that they bring out with fresh Italian bread from the bakery down the road is delicious as a starter with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"The best things about this restaurant is the sauce and the speedy service. Other then that, the food was only ok. They give you a lot of mediocre tasting food. My mom liked it but I don't have to eat here again. I originally wanted to go to Mia Bella's across the street where the food is excellent but they didn't open until 4:30. I should have checked the time before I came all the way over here. Calamari was doughy and lacked flavor. I had linguini and Italian sausage, like I said the sauce was great but the sausage tasted like it was old and not prepared well. The antipasti salad for two was huge and if it had a better taste, it would have been great. Everything on it was big and needed to be cut with a knife. Definitely not my favorite."}
{"text":"I am positively bewildered by the negative reviews of this restaurant. Last night, we had a lovely, flawless meal here. A bottle of chianti for the table, a couple of appetizers: the crisp, and what I believe were fresh calamari; as well as the stuffed banana peppers, which was possibly the best dish of the night. Both were accompanied by what was obviously a homemade, well-seasoned tomato basil sauce. The entrees ordered were eggplant parmigiana (a decadent, crisp, and fluffy six layer affair), veal parmigiana (lightly breaded and tender), and penne arrabiata (which arrived steaming hot, with sliced black olives, and a spicy tomato cream sauce). The simplicity of the dishes hardly means that Trattoria serves clunky food. While the prices are similar to those at national chains specializing in serving goopy, depressing,  4-cheese messes, the dishes at Trattoria are unfussy, straight-forward, and well, damn good. The chefs at Trattoria allow the ingredients to really shine for what they are, and if those ingredients were anything less than high-quality the result would be mediocre. That was anything but true of our delightful meal. The service was fast, helpful, and courteous (our waitress rightly suggested that we share 2 appetizers). The complimentary bread was delicious and fresh, served with diced tomatoes in garlic. I hope to return."}
{"text":"Great place to meet and eat. Friendly staff. The eggplant parmesan is amazing! There seems to many negative remarks about the calamari. I can only say I ordered it and it was also great. Not heavily breaded, thankfully. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a 5 star rating, but it seems there are some loose ends at this place that need some remedy... The past two times I have came to this place almost 2 hours before their supposed close time they tell me they are closing early and that \"I can put my jacket back on\". I clearly saw a pretty busy bar and a decent capacity in the restaurant. I also have also encountered difficulties when choosing their catering option for an event. My order was placed and they completely forgot about me. Despicable. When they finally did get my order filled they were late, forgot parmesan, and didn't bring silverware. The only reason I give a 3 star review is because I love their food and want to love this place, but consistent disappointments leave me pondering wether or not I will go back. Clean up your sloppy management."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant. As a business traveler, I experience many restaurant types and levels. This is by far the worst Italian food I have ever had. Food in any hospital cafeteria is better. Seriously. I ordered a filet Mignon and it was smothered in a brown sauce with mushrooms. It was spilling over the plate. I had to ask for another plate to avoid spilling. The quality of meat was very bad. Stringy, tough , tasted  old and overpriced. The potatoes on the side were cold, tasteless and greasy. I cook way better than this at home. The vegetables on the side were a broccoli and carrot mix. They were from a frozen bag and tasted like it. I really hope I don't get get food poisoning from this place. The waitress was very slow despite only having a few of five tables that were sat. They also make you put your tip in the receipt before they run your credit card. Really? It took almost 20 min to get my card and receipt back. The waitress did not even inquire on how the food was. I think she knows it's disgusting. Will never go back. Save your money!!!! Can I give .02 stars?"}
{"text":"we had come here for lunch a few weeks ago and husband had ordered this dish Gnoccchi Al Burro. I had ordered spinach ravioli which was wonderful and yet his looked even better.  We decided to come back and bring mom and my sister. and all ordered the same dish. They bring out bread  it is not warm and they serve with margarine rather than real butter. Thank God the pasta is so fresh and delicious. We  love the gnocchi. all 4 of us ordered the same dish  Gnocchi al Burro. and topped with fresh Parmesean cheese.  so much food that able to take and truly enjoy for dinner tomorrow nite and you know will be just as good.  next time would love to try a dessert"}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago on a Friday around 5 pm. Bartender was great and very attentive. Ordered a few beers and glasses of wine. We also ordered calamari and the owner brought out some specialty rice balls for us, on the house, which were amazing! Only stayed for a short while but it seemed like a great place to go back and have dinner! Bar area is small, not sure of the total size of the restaurant, and dress is casual."}
{"text":"the smell upon walking into this place is good enough for the 5 stars. the food is amazing. i grew up w/ authentic italian food and am quite picky when it comes to something as simple as marinara sauce. but this place is delicious and gets no complaints from me. the atmosphere is cute- maybe a little crowded- but it's little italy so what else would you expect?"}
{"text":"We went here with my son and his fiance along with her parents because we thought it would be a special place for a special event. We were wrong and we found out quickly; the hostess lady was just nasty and acted so put out just because we debated for a minute over which table would be better for our gathering. The food was nothing special either....just OK. Our actual waitress was pretty attentive and nice, but unfortunately the rudeness of the hostess lady was continually obvious as she stalked around the place. We will never go here again.....there are too many restaurants out there that appreciate their guests and treat them well."}
{"text":"The food here is slop, but the portions are yuuugggeee. I had the linguini with meat sauce. It was alright."}
