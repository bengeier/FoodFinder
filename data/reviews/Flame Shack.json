{"text":"This place is overrated. Burger was dry, they were stingy with the gravy on the poutine. The cheese curds felt like i was chewing on rubber. Not to mention I seen the cook picking his ears with his fingers then touching up the buns. This place is gross!! I skipped out on whopper wednesday at BK to pay $13.50 for a shack burger and poutine. I would've had better food/value at BK. Never going back!"}
{"text":"This has become our replacement place for Burger's Priest - tired of waiting in that cramped location. I think their double burger with cheese is fantastic and on par with burger's priest - you can really tell the difference with fresh ground, quality meat - really juicy. Gave it 4 stars for the decor - if they smartened up the place I think they would attract more clientele - it doesn't bother us as the burgers are so great, but suspect it does others?"}
{"text":"I love Flame Shack! It's definitely my go to burger joint for flavourful, never-disappointing burgers for a great price! I never feel guilty paying for the food like I would in other places where u know it's super overpriced. I love how the chef focuses on good food rather than fooling your eyes into 'cool' decor and things that don't matter in the end. I love the fries and the fact that I can never get sick of them. The burgers are always fresh and irresistibly good! They are a good size as well. I often wish I had room for another but once you're done - you're done - I'll savour another for next time. Love it!"}
{"text":"Volcano burger was delicious. Fresh toppings. Patty was seemed fresh and expertly cooked. Should have had more onion rings with my order. 50 cents a ring seems high. My son's Shack burger was 'awesome'. Need a better drink selection."}
{"text":"I can't think of a better burger under $10 in Toronto. Avoids the overseasoning of most chains and focuses on just great quality beef. Not sure about one of the previous posters: I've only paid debit here, so definitely not cash only. And the fries have the crispness of being properly blanched before being cooked. It's hard not to love an independent operation that clearly loves and knows their burgers."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto for a business visit. I was starving when I was around flame shack. Found this place. The chicken sandwich was amazing. Their french fries was pretty tasty and was pretty unique. It's s small shop but pretty clean one. Takes only cash or Canadian debit card. So keep some cash with you if you are a traveler. Be sure visit this if you around!"}
{"text":"Finally - a place in Corktown that has a decent burger.

The decor is a work in progress (I hope) but it's easily forgivable after digging into one of their tasty burgers.

Staff are friendly and the menu has a good variety of options.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to give more stars but just can't. This is one of those places that do it right and then finish it off all wrong.  They got a great hamburger patty, but the bun oh my gawd, what were they thinking. They call the cheese Cheddar but it is really Kraft slices (yuk).  Cash only, an issue, I don't travel with cash and find cash only places a nuisance. Nice people run the place, very polite, just dropped the ball a few times."}
{"text":"I came here twice. Both times I've had unacceptable service.

The first time I ordered a chicken burger. They accidentally cooked a beef burger. When I pointed this out, they threw it in the trash and proceeded to make a chicken burger. I've had incorrect orders at places like KFC, and they will let you keep the incorrect order as well as give you a replacement to make up for the lost time. I pointed this out and they shrugged. The chicken burger patty was obviously a supermarket patty.

The second time, I ordered a smoked meat poutine. They charged me for a normal poutine. After the transaction was complete, the cook realized his error and demanded more money from me before he began cooking. It was his mistake, but I guess they're super stingy. The poutine was mediocre. Cheese wasn't fresh, and the gravy was so-so.

I won't be back here."}
{"text":"Just disappointing. That's all I can say, surprisingly expensive for a burger with no choices and soggy too thick fries."}
{"text":"I've tried to come here on several occasions and each time the restaurant was closed (earlier than the time posted). 

I'm glad I gave the restaurant one last chance. The volcano burger and fries I ordered for takeout were delicious. Personally, I think it is the best burger in the area. Although the choices are pretty limited. 

The burger tasted clean, not oily or greasy, and the toppings were also very fresh. 

I will definitely be returning. 

The one star deduction is because I wish the burger had more of a char to it."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the decor, the home style burgers made fresh here are worth trying. I wasn't sure when I walked in, was pleasantly surprised and will be back! The fries could be better though."}
{"text":"I. Am. A. Fan.
I was around the area and this place seemed to be well-rated on Yelp. The menu, was pasted on the wall, and had a huge array. I went with the classic Shack Burger, which was the cheapest on the menu (Surprise, surprise, Asian surprise). It took a while for them to make it, but it was handmade, including the meat. The burgar itself was AMAZING. My inner fat kid was screaming. The only thing I would say is to eat it soon, since the bottom burger bun was soggy by the time I got back to work nearby (less than 5 minutes).

Overall, definitely will come back! :)"}

I am not sure what to rate this place. The burger patties taste absolutely exquisite - handmade, home-cooked, fresh deliciousness. But then, they slap it in between soggy buns and lettuce, and I am not sure any more. Their flame sauce isn't highly innovative either (a blend of ketchup and mayonnaise). 

I look at the sloppy mess in front of me, take a bite and immediately, I am in heaven. The burger tastes, amazing, no doubt about it. Especially now that No Bull, not too far away on Parliament closed down. 

For the little joint The Flame Shack is, the burgers are overpriced. Especially when I draw comparisons with other burger places - the far better counterparts."}
{"text":"Super cheap for delicious burgers! 

I got the most basic one on the menu, I would recommend one of the more creative options. Only a buck or two extra for way more toppings. Fries were great as well, worth the add on charge. 

A bit slow, but it was all fresh off the grill."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best burgers my boyfriend and I have ever had. We decided to check this place out since we were in the area and super hungry and I'm so happy we did because I don't think we can have burgers anywhere else ever again.

First you just have to get past the décor because once you've tasted the food, the décor has no bearing. We had the volcano and out-n-california burgers. Everything was freshly made and toppings were on point. But what we really appreciated was that we could taste everything in the burgers and nothing was overpowering the other, which is often the case, especially when it comes to sauce. The burger patty, super tender. The burger buns were kind of thin/falling apart at the end but I didn't even care because it just worked. Everything about the burgers just worked so well together! I'm getting hungry writing this review.

In terms of price, I don't think it gets any better than this, considering gourmet burgers at other places can cost over $10. The gourmet burgers we got were $6.95 each and the out-n-california had what seemed like half an avocado in it!

If you're a burger fan, you HAVE to check this place out! The owner was super friendly! Once you've eaten here, you'll feel his passion and see that the delicious, fresh quality food really speaks for itself."}
{"text":"The burger is the draw. I can't judge the bun as I went with the lettuce wrap on a bbq bacon burger. Overall great value and super tasty. Very fresh and a good size patty. Decor is basic but it was still comfortable to dine in. 

I will be back."}
