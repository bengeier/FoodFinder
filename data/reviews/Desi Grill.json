{"text":"Wow! This place has one of the cleanest bathrooms I have ever seen.  I was thoroughly impressed.   The service was friendly,  and the food was  filling (large portions,  good  for  sharing).  After eating the Alloo Tikki my friend stated \"if the world ended right now, I would be happy\".  That  is  a good  testimony to the quality of the food  if you ask me."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for $30 for $50 towards take out. We ordered garlic naan, Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, and Prawn Vindaloo (spicy). The prawns were jumbo and fresh, not overcooked. Both chicken dishes were amazing.  Flavours were there, marination was there, portion size was great.  All in all I would buy another Groupon and even without it, it's definitely a place we will be eating at again. Very happy with the food - especially when you are buying a Groupon you never know what you are in for.  Only thing to note is that the online menu is not exactly what they offer, and the \"Order Online\" doesn't work.  I wanted the Rice Pea Paluo, which they didn't have on the menu in the restaurant (only on the online menu). They offered a fried rice instead: red and green peppers, cottage cheese...I decided to just make my own rice at home while picking my food up."}
{"text":"My date and I went here one December afternoon after seeing a 20$ for 40$ worth of food groupon. We were one of three groups in the restaurant at the time.  Our server was very attentive and helpful in recommending dishes, and heat level. We ordered various naan (the garlic naan being our favourite), lamb vindaloo, and butter chicken. The portions were generous (for two hungry people, we had left overs to take home). My favourite dish that was the lamb vindaloo. Compared to the Clay Oven's, the lamb vindaloo is a more mellow, and has a better flavour balance between a tangy tomato, and a cream-based sauce. I think that the prices are also slightly lower than the Clay Oven's.   Would go back for sure. Thanks for the meal!"}
{"text":"Summary: Our party of 4 went here to try this joint out. We went there at about 7pm on a Sunday evening. For the price, the service really sucked. Each curry entree we ordered was $15 and only included about a measuring cup worth of curry. I have been to many Indian restaurants where some amount roti or rice are included with each entree. But over here plain naan was $2 a piece extra, and rice was a bit more I believe. This is fine. But the lack of prompt service and the passive attitude of the server made us feel very unwelcome. There is always risk when trying out a new restaurant. But this misadventure definitely left us with a bad taste in our mouths.  Food: Food was just alright, definitely nothing special. The Naans were very fresh and just the right amount of chewiness. The lamb biryani seemed a bit sticky and stale. I have never had chicken vindaloo so I can't comment on how well it was made, but it did have a lemony flavour which I didn't find very spicy.  Service: Service was really slow, only 2 people were serving as far as we could see. Even with the restaurant about 20% filled, they would pass by our table area every 20 minutes or so and we'd have to holler at them to get their attention. At three points during our dinner we were stuck waiting for service. First time was for water. They only left one water bottle at our table which was not enough for our party of 4. Second time was for Naan/Roti. We had to wait about 15 minutes for our Naans while our food cooled down in front of us. Lastly, it took about 10 minutes to get the bill. Which came to around $75 for 4 people."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to this restaurant.  I purchased a Groupon for $20 for $40.  when we arrived at the restaurant there was smoke and cooking smell everywhere and it was very hard to breath.  I went in the evening so it was nice and quiet, but the Food was not that greatest, it was ok.  I have been to a lot of Indian/pakistani restaurants and had great experiences."}
{"text":"It was about 11:50 and I was thinking of Fat Kee when I saw that a new place had taken the place of Moroccan Jannah in the corner of the plaza. I stepped into Desi Grill and was greeted by warm colors and a friendly waitress. She informed me that there was a lunch buffet for $14.95 but I could also order from the menu. I opted for the buffet. The decor was more of a trendy bistro, each wall was a different color and the tables set with cutlery and water glasses of different colors. Each wall was a different color. Chairs were well padded and upholstered with fake leather. All in all very modern and funky. The buffet consisted of Basmatic Rice, hot dishes, sides and dessert. Hot dishes: Veg Pakora, Fish Pakora, Shahi Paneer, Chana Masala, Mix Veg, Chili Paneer, Butter Chicken and Goat Curry; side dishes: Papri Chat, Mix Raita; Salad and fruit, an assortment of chutney and pickles; dessert: mango cream with fruit; Ras Malai (sort of a cheesecake ball in some creamy scented syrup. The Fish Pakora was excellent, crisp and the fish perfectly cooked, it was obviously fresh from the kitchen as it was still piping hot. The rest of the dishes was average indian fare. The goat curry stood out, each piece though small was not just bone but had tender morsels of meat on them, nicely flavoured and the goat was not gamey as it can be sometimes. The Ras Malai was nice, a bit overpowering with the rose flavour but not too sweet.  I am only giving this place a 3 because the food was not hot temperature wise. I got there around 11:50 and it was only after 30 minutes that I actually saw steam rising from the buffet table. Had a food inspector come I doubt that it would have passed the temperature test. By the time I got the food back to my table most of it was warm to cool. I'm thinking that the food was brought out and then the steam table turned on.  Judging by taste I gauged that everything had been freshly cooked just not kept to a piping hot temperature. I think that if the food had been at the correct temperature the flavours would have come out better. The basmati rice was perfectly cooked and the naan brought to my table minutes after I had returned from the buffet. It is some of the best naan I've had, light and fluffy and they gave me a whole naan even though I was by myself. The paneer and chili were not really very distinguishing but decent. Buffets are always a very efficient lunch as the food is ready to go. Will probably give it a second try to see if they fix the temperature problem which Imentioned to the waitress."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Ordered chicken tikka, butter chicken, hakka noodles. I think their food is mediocre.  Customer  service is a little poor, they need to work on cleanliness as well. For God's sake if your in a indian restaurant  play indian music!!! Jeezzz... ambiance of the place not good. Overall mediocre."}
{"text":"Very few options for lunch buffet and they dont taste good. I had to finish my lunch with butter chicken & naan. Had lot of tables to accommodate people but they have to first improve their buffet menu and also change the recipes to taste good."}
