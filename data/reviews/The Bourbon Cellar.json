{"text":"Let me preface this by saying, they have only been open 2 months.  My husband and I popped in there on a whim last night.  Pricey, but they are new and we always try new places in our area looking for a new favorite.  Ordered the $39 Halibut with Mushroom Cream Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes, Creamed Spinach  and $44 New York with Garlic Mashed and Asparagus. Our meal took 35 minutes and arrived served on ice cold plates.  The steak was maybe 1/2\" thick and was coasted in what I think was a port wine sauce (which was NOT mentioned on the menu), ordered Medium rare and was Medium at best, it was not eaten. The Asparagus was blanched and no seasoning.  A little olive oil and roasting it would have gone a long way.  The mashed potatoes were ok, but when you put hot food on a cold plate, you get cold food rapidly.  The Halibut was good, but sauce got lost underneath the pieces of wilted lettuce the fish was served on.  Potatoes were boiled and pan fried, not roasted, no seasoning, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say the creamed spinach was made with frozen spinach, not fresh.  Fish dinner was a 4 out of 10, steak was a 2 out of 10.  We normally will not complain but since they were new, we thought constructive comments would help them.  The chef came out and explained he was proud of his food and would like another chance, and gave us a $25 gift card and they STILL charged us for the $44 steak that was left uneaten as well as all the asparagus.  I wouldn't be reviewing so harshly if it would have been handled differently.  My husband and I eat at high end restaurants here in the Valley, Chicago, Vegas, Seattle, LA and if you are going to charge that kind of money for plates, you better make sure you nail it and if a customer is not happy, still charging them for an uneaten meal, is a solid lock that we will not be back.  We left the gift card.  The gentleman next to us had the Seared Ahi and said it was great, so perhaps worth a first try, but thought I'd give an honest review.  I wish them luck. I wanted to add the restaurant is beautiful and the wait staff and bartender were awesome."}
{"text":"Good meal but a little pricey with so many other choices in North Scottsdale. Wanted to try the oysters but they weren't available. Not exactly sure why the restaurant is called Bourbon Cellar there was no mention of the bourbon selection. Probably not on our must return list."}
{"text":"For the best fresh seafood in the Cave Creek/Carefree area, this is the place. Our Seabass and halibut could not have been better. It is flown in about every Three days. The vegetables served with our entrées were fresh and perfectly cooked. The owner, Doug, is passionate about serving the most delicious meals and he does just that."}
{"text":"Very disappointed having read the opening write-ups. I specifically went to try their signature Filet. But they were out - no filet. I ordered a glass of the Russian River Pinot Noir - but they were out of that too! I sat at the bar, which was a mistake as the server there was totally absorbed with discussing Bourbons with a couple of other patrons and I waited 10 minutes before I could get his attention. But I eventually ordered the New York, which at a $49 price tag - much more than the Filet - surely had to be good. Sadly it was not. It was cooked to my perfect temperature as ordered though, but it came smothered in a sweet bourbon sauce (which I had asked to be on the side) which far from complementing the flavours of the meat, totally masked them and, to add to my disappointment, the meat was distinctly chewy. I chose the garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus as my included sides. The asparagus were perfectly cooked, but arranged messily on the plate, and the garlic mash was overly liquid and brownish in color which detracted from its appeal. Also, strangely, the plate was garnished with what certainly looked and tasted like a store-bought stuffed egg pinned to the steak on a stick! Odd. For a brand new restaurant to be out of its signature items in its first days is never a good thing, but in order for it to succeed it will have to significantly up its product and service to justify the very high prices its menu demands. One final word on the wine list. If you like to be adventurous and try something you have never heard of, then this the list is for you! I tried one somewhat obscure Oregon Pinot Noir (as my 1st choice was not available), which to my palate explained perhaps why indeed it is obscure. Teething troubles hopefully, but certainly it does not live up to the quality to be expected from its ambitiously high prices."}
{"text":"I read alot of reviews of this restaurant and about the chef. I was dying to get here! Well today was the day, I completely regret not coming here sooner.  The food is outstanding, I can't find words to describe it! The flavours, the combinations of ingredients, the presentation. It was amazing. We ordered the oysters,  grouper and bison steak. ! All I have to say is that, every bite was euphoric. This is best steak house/seafood restaurant in North scottsdale.  The atmosphere is great, cozy and intimate. The wine and burbon menu is fantastic. There is a beverage for  everyone.   To top off the evening, the artist (chef) of the food! Doug came to the table to see how the evening was. It was such a great experience to meet him and thank him for the wonderful night. His love of food and the quality of food served can be seen and tasted with every bite.  I highly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed.  Thank you for a wonderful night."}
{"text":"Over priced, if I was going to spend this kind of money in the future , I'd go to Flemings, Mastro steak house, or another high end steak house in the area. The Service was also fair at best."}
{"text":"Had the three course dinner last night. Filet cooked to perfection. Everything was spot-on. So happy to find such an excellent neighborhood place. Our server Jessica was awesome. Have already recommended TBC to friends."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Chef Doug came to our table to ask about our meal. Really nice experience!"}
{"text":"We went last weekend. We were one of only two tables, though it was early.  We saw the menu online and were excited about having the crab cakes.  Arrived early at the restaurant, ordered a bottle of wine - great summer special 50% off.  We decided on the crab cakes and lobster mac 'n cheese and were told by the waitress they didn't have them tonight. We ordered a salmon burger and was told 5 minutes later they didn't have the salmon. YET she told us about a salmon entrée that was in addition to the menu.  we are trying new restaurants, local restaurants this summer.  How can we do this when they don't have what is on their regular menu?  probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Got the salmon and sirloin. Super delicious and chef Doug was awesome. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just look at these mussels!  Some of them I had to cut in half with a knife!  You don't come across seafood like this in Arizona often.  The broth was too good to let go so I asked for more bread to finish it off.  For my entree I ordered the 10 oz filet and it was cooked to perfection.  The sweet potato mash is to die for!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back! Filet was excellent, atmosphere is perfect and staff was delightful!!  Thanks Doug for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last night and had a great dinner.  I had the 3 course salmon dinner with the best creamed spinach ever and fresh anchovies on my caesar salad.   Hubby had the filet burger and said it was really good. Doug, the owner was friendly and explained alot about his food and preparations.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent three course meal with petit filet done perfectly. Nice wine list, great ambiance, and Jessica was delightful!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place! I've been here twice now and both times have been great. Each time I ordered the filet, cooked medium rare, and each time it was a terrific cut of meat cooked perfectly.   I'm not a huge vegetable fan (I think of vegetables as the food that my food eats). But the last time I had the asparagus, which was good, and this time I had the peas, which were fantastic! I wish my mother had thought to mix bacon with peas and cook them the way they do here. Maybe I would have eaten my vegetables as a child!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night for dinner while in town from New York. Both the food and service were excellent. Great selection of appetizers, fresh fish and meats. Doug, the owner and chef, also has a butcher shop where he brings in all his meat. The fish is shipped in daily. I had the filet and it was very tender and well prepared. We also had the salmon which was so fresh and delicious. Wine and bourbon were great and they made wonderful selections for us to try. The service couldn't have been friendlier. Unfortunately we don't live here and while I don't write many reviews, I felt that this place deserves it. Everyone there was so nice and really seems to pour their heart into the food and service. Doug came out multiple times to check on everyone's order. If I lived nearby this would be a regular spot. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in just to check out this place. What a pleasant surprise. We both had beef. I had the sirloin and my wife had the filet. Both were phenomenal. Each was a perfect medium rare. The entire meal was excellent. The deviled eggs were scrumptious. This was in every aspect a first rate meal! The bill was $130, that included a bottle of wine and desert for two. Very reasonable for the quality of meal we had. All items are not pricey like the steaks. There are salads and sandwiches as well. I would wager they are top quality as well. I intend to find out."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten 3 times now at the Bourbon Cellar twice we had drinks( the Cellar Smash is a favorite Basil Hayden  orange liquor and honey and lemon juice) and appetizers which the muscles and oysters are the best we have had in the city. The dinner menu has numerous choices I had the sea bass the sauce was amazing, my husband had Halibut in a white mushroom cream sauce again excellent flavor. Chef Doug visited with us at our table  very knowledgeable about his bourbons and a nice young man. The jazz background music sets the tone for a very enjoyable eating experience. Returning again on New Years Eve , cant wait"}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed with our experience tonight. It was my birthday and I was excited to try something new but won't be going back. Ahi tuna was not pink, more  brown. Steak average. Cocktails and hush puppies good. Great staff but food quality just not making it. Sorry"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Chef is very personable and talented. Perfect place to celebrate our 16th anniversary! We will be back and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Easily the best bone-in ribeye and 10oz filet around. Great selection of wine and bourbon (obviously). Chef Doug is very knowledge and very friendly makes his way around to each table. Sides we had were cream of corn (and another order by wife wife later it was so good), garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli ... all was amazing and perfectly cooked then finished with a cheesecake to go.  Very knowledgeable about bourbons so if you need advice or want to do a bourbon flight - highly recommend it"}
{"text":"We went last night and our meal was just great! The steaks are the best we have had in Scottsdale and we go out a LOT!   I do not understand why the were only a few diners- I would be very sad if this wonderful place went under. Give it a try- you will be pleased!!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent bourbon selection!  The chef and owner came to the table and we talked about food and bourbon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great evening with the wife. Awesome setting and a great meal. The all day happy hour was a nice touch. Burger was wonderful and the tiramisu was incredible. Just something great about an owner walking around to chat, making sure your having a good time."}
{"text":"The five stars belong to the excellent cuisine.  Service, on the other hand, receives one star.  We had a reservation on 2/14 for four people at 6:30.  Restaurant NOT full.  The server, came right over for drink order, which we received in timely fashion.  Placed food order at 7 (again, restaurant not full). Received food at 8:40 after numerous requests inquiring its whereabouts including a discussion with the chef.  Left restaurant at 9:10.  Wouldn't be so down on the wait time if server  had come back to the table other than when we flagged him down looking for food order.   We were never asked for second drink order (which we would have placed) nor was any attempt made to appease us for long wait time, i.e. have a glass of wine or  dessert (on the house) to share."}
{"text":"The food is really dank and you cant beat the $5 margaritas! This is the only place i got to for burgers and ribeyes"}
{"text":"A fairly new restaurant that I thought I would try.  Intimate atmosphere, relaxing music. I tried the sautéed shrimp with garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The shrimp was fresh and you could taste the difference. Creamed spinach was perfect and garlic mashed potatoes melted in your mouth. Very impressed. Prices very reasonable. Entrees include two sides. Thanks Ben!"}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to share this review because i don't want to have to wait for a table in the future. Tonight was our third time dining at the Bourbon Cellar in less than a month. We are local and very excited to have this gem in our neighborhood. The food is phenomenal but even better is the exceptional customer service! We have many choices for great food around us but the experience at the Bourbon Cellar is what makes it so special! The Chef and staff really make you feel welcome and special."}
{"text":"Excellent steak!  Excellent tacos!  Steakhouse done right !    #pinkelephant   Great service too !  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been back a few times since my last review, I'm not one to give out 5 stars very often but every time that I've been in it has been amazing. Chef Doug always makes us feel so welcome and I see him engaging with his guests at the tables. The food was great and he has a really nice wine and cocktail list. It's hidden gem in north Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We ordered the hamburger. It was nothing special. The meat was very thin,  overloaded with lettuce. Nothing like the photos."}
{"text":"We had a great red wine on happy hour, then on to crab cakes(outstanding, lots of crab)me& my husband, a ground filet burger to die for.  Service & atmosphere excellent too.  We'll b back next week."}
{"text":"The appetizer potato hush puppies are amazing! Our steaks were cooked perfectly, literally could cut my filet with a fork. Service was kind and when I asked for some new broccoli (the first batch was a little salty for my taste) they we're happy to assist. I would choose the mashed potatoes over the other sides. Best thing also- dog friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Superb, great staff, very well prepared food, neat little neighborhood gem not to be missed. The fresh fish available and steaks are of the highest quality with imaginative sauces."}
{"text":"First and most likely last time here.  Summer menu, basically diner food and steaks available but, not listed on menu.  We figured it's been open for a bit so we should give it a go. Living out here our options are limited.   I ordered the tri-tip sandwich which was absolutely tasteless and dry. Fries were thick and heavily greasy. Truly disappointing.  Terrible! He, ordered the filet burger with the coleslaw.  His was okay, just fine, nothing that made us say we need to have this again.   My dinner was removed from the bill but, I did get the sense the owner did not appreciate my candor.    I did realize shortly after ordering that he is the same owner/chef of an awful, now closed Italian place in Carefree...  To comment on your response.   I in fact did NOT finish the sandwich and certainly not those fries.  The plates were removed by the server.   As for the other restaurant, if not you then you had a twin that worked there.   He had the same tattoos too!"}
{"text":"We were frequent (weekly) patrons of the previous Italian restaurant tenant, and were VERY excited to try this new place out. We are NOT bourbon drinkers so we were slightly confused by the name and think perhaps a different name might draw more customers?  Since we typically go out to dinner 5 nights a week, we are always on the lookout for a new culinary experience. I ordered the steak, my partner ordered the salmon. Perhaps we are spoiled, but for our money the BEST steak in Arizona is at Durant's. Although we hate the long drive into Phoenix, when you eat at Durant's you know you are going to have the juiciest steak that is worth the drive and also worth the price.   In a word, we were \"underwhelmed\" by our meal. I'm not sure how this strip mall restaurant is going to survive as there are many fine choices for fine dining in North Scottsdale. I will say that we were very disappointed that they don't offer a bread basket as we are bread lovers and got use to the excellent quality bread that was offered by the previous tenant.  Delicious homemade, crusty bread sets the tone for the meal. Perhaps the chef/owner will take note. I'm awarding 3 stars for a new establishment with a lovely interior. You don't feel like you're in a strip mall, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING Fresh Food with many GREAT flavors! Very quaint, really nice decor, awesome service, the owner/ Chef was VERY personable and graciously checked on us ...a couple times! We had Father's Day Dinner here and everyone ordered something different, crab cakes, potato balls, ahi tuna, salmon, deviled eggs, scallops, tacos, lobster mac and cheese, sweet potato mash, and it was ALL SO GOOD!!!!!!! As we were leaving we ran into other friends who said they Loved The Bourbon Cellar too! We are so thrilled to have such a great place to eat close to home, and we cannot wait to tell others about it!"}
{"text":"If you have always wanted an amazing chef as a buddy and then have him whip you up something good to eat...then THIS is your place! Doug is not only an amazing chef,; he is also your proud host and bartender! He believes in a fully balanced meal from step one! The restaurant space is like eating in a barrel room (which we loved) and has lots of great light! We had the corn chowder that contained potatoes and smokey bacon with a cajun flare! Then we both had the caesar salad with bourbon glazed grilled salmon. It was the perfect meal if you like great food but not something as big as a steak. His protein portions are sizeable. We were stuffed after finishing our wine. On our way out Doug handed us our mini ice cream desserts to go! Hugs and smiles shared and on our way. You enter in as a client...but you will leave happy, full, and feeling like you just had an amazing time with a friend!"}
{"text":"We make a point to eat here every time we are in the North Scottsdale area (which is 5-6 times a year). The food is AMAZING and the service is so personal that we are greeted by the owner from our very 1st visit. We have even hosted a large group here and not a single item or drink was forgotten or even late coming to our table. And anyone with kids will tell you finding an elegant eatery that will please their picky palates is tricky. Not so here! My 5 kids licked their plates clean and now look forward to our dinners here. Truly a gem in the area! We have recommended them to all of our Vacation Rental guests and have never heard anything but the best from them!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"We came here last weekend for a friend's birthday.  We had a lovely experience but I think there are a few things that could use some tweaking.    Husband loved the bourbon flights as it's his favorite spirit.  They certainly have an impressive list and many which we'd not heard of it.  On the menu, the mention of the flight was in a relatively small box that I happened to see (husband did not).  Advertise this more - it's in your name!  :)   The cocktails were delicious.  I managed to get two WTFs down - very yummy.  We did find it curious that they use actual honey (which doesn't dissolve well unless the beverage is warm) instead of honey syrup.  It coagulated at the bottom which didn't detract at all - it was just an odd choice.    Despite being warned that our entrees would come with a deviled egg, we ordered them as appetizers and they were outstanding.  (I was happy to eat my \"garnish\" egg when it arrived too.)    We were served an amuse bouche of potato croquette that they called a \"hush puppy\".  I appreciate the gesture but collectively, we found the faux puppies bland.    I sampled a friend's crab cake and it was fabulous.  I also sampled a friend's lobster mac n' cheese and it was delicious as well.   I ordered the grouper and it certainly tasted like this sucker had been alive only moments ago.  It was extraordinarily fresh (and I've eaten grouper just plucked out of the gulf).  Definitely high quality fish but could use a little more seasoning.  (Or I probably should have asked for salt and pepper.)  After asking about a gluten issue, we learned that the fries are pan fried with each order and they are fabulous.  I don't generally recommend getting fries at higher end places but that goes out the window here - get them.    I have no words for the desserts.  I would come here just for the desserts.  For my friend's birthday, they brought some kind of bar with salted caramel on it that was amazing.  We also ordered the chocolate rum cake which was fabulous as well.    We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"If you're just looking for a drink, or going on a date with amazing dinner, this place is great.    Their bourbon selection is great, and the owners knowledge of good bourbon (other than the usual cliche suggestions like Pappy and other overrated selections) is on point.  Moving on to the food, it was so unexpectedly delicious and memorable, that my mouth is watering as I write this four months later.  I asked the owner what he would suggest and he gave me a few off menu specials (not the kind where the ahi is about to be unusable so they push it like crazy), and he sold me on the rabbit set atop three cheese stuffed pasta shells in a sauce that was unbelievably delicious.  Until then, my favorite rabbit I had ever eaten was at Mustards Grill in Napa, and this blew that away."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 co-workers after work and while the food was decent/good, the service was AWFUL. At this price point (steaks for $45), service should be better. To start, our server was new and not only did she tell us this repeatedly, she spent more time at the table talking about how bad of a job she was doing than just doing her job. Then, one of my co-workers asked for the bartenders recommendation on a cocktail and asked that he just pick his favorite for her. That's a risky move, I know. When it arrived, it was stronger than she wanted so she asked him to water it down. His reply? \"No.\" Um, What? We laughed it off and I asked for a tall glass with ice so she could let it water itself down and he did get her that but he was really rude about it. The third incident was when another co-worker who is in AA asked for a ginger ale. They instead brought him a ginger beer. He, not being familiar with ginger beer sent it back and let them know he was in recovery and this was not ok. Instead of apologizing, out waitress, another server, AND the rude bartender all came by at different times to tell us that ginger beer is non-alcoholic. Turning an uncomfortable situation into a VERY uncomfortable situation for my friend. And, to top it off, ginger beer and ginger ale are 2 totally different drinks and it's not even remotely what he ordered. Very odd. I cannot believe a restaurant with a menu priced this high would allow service this crappy. I would not recommend this place to visitors especially when the Scottsdale area is brimming with great restaurants."}
{"text":"Went with wife and friends nicely decorated with a quiet and casual atmosphere. Service was average. Wine list limited and pricey. Decent variety of entrées steak seafood and chicken. Pricey but included two sides. I had the pork chop,to die for,well worth the money potatoes and broccoli were cooked to perfection. The others all had the small filet, two very goods and one ok. The chocolate cake we split four ways and everyone loved it. The chef came over and inquired about the meal a nice touch. First time for everyone and we all enjoyed ourselves. Next time we will try one of the bourbons."}
{"text":"My second review of this restaurant. As always, Doug never disappoints. I love that he created a drink for me by me just telling him what I was craving. His steak with blueberry sauce was to die for and the creamed spinach was orgasmic. If I can say that out loud. Yes, I'm saying that out loud! But what's over and above the creative dishes that he serves is still his passion and welcoming spirit. I just love this place and love the fact that I only have to drive five minutes to get there. Another Indiana boy- must be why I like him and his restaurant so much!"}
{"text":"Looks like we missed our chance to dine here. They are moving out today. THEY ARE CLOSED FOR BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"Way over rated. I ordered the tacos with filet, very salty and tasted just like chorizo not filet.  i did not enjoy the long brown strand of hair in my taco either. Did not say anything, didn't want to be one of those people that cause a scene, the place is small and would have drawn attraction to the incident. Looks like they're doing a lot of business and didn't want to be a buzz kill. My husband loved his burger, said it was one of the best he had ever had, so that made his night. Not saying we'll never go back but not in hurry to do that. Sorry"}
{"text":"Doug Smith is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet! We were honored and blessed to have him and his team host the adoption reception for our daughter today at the Bourbon Cellar. He had a special menu, open house style for our group of about 65-75 people. His whole team was very gracious and happy to be a part of the day. It was a very social moment for our family and we will cherish this memory forever. Thank you Doug and Team!    This is the best halibut outside of Alaska! You have to come here. The chef, Doug, is the nicest guy and will come out and have a conversation with you. He is passionate about bringing in the seafood fresh!!"}
{"text":"I am a heat-seeking missile with new restaurants in my neck of the woods, so had to visit The Bourbon Cellar since it just opened mere weeks ago.   SO MANY PROS with this place! It has a great ambiance, nice bar, contemporary/rustic vibe, and good music playing. All is positive on the ambiance.  Chef came out more than once to ask us how everything was (HUGE PLUS!) Our waitress was nice and helpful. The service was great and welcoming in every respect.  9 year old daughter ordered oysters, apparently flown in fresh daily from Prince Edward Island. We are huge seafood lovers, and have spent quite a bit of time in Maine and the east coast, so we've had the best. The oysters did not disappoint, they were fresh and fabulous with plenty of traditional oyster fixins'. \"Tasted like the ocean!\" according to the child. I agree, but she only let me have one! She also ordered a creamed corn side, which she licked clean. I thought aloud, \"Where else could we go in Phoenix to have oysters like this?\" We came up empty, so if you want an oysters fix, this would be THE PLACE to go!  My other one had a nice shrimp and potato soup that she enjoyed. I had the scallops appetizer (2 scallops) plus a salad, and husband had a steak plus roasted potatoes on the side. All was great, and perfectly prepared.  Unfortunately, the prices are utterly insane and really puts me at more of a 3 star rating. This isn't Binkley's or even Ruth Chris. The ala carte pricing is crazy. Once you pay $44 for the entree and add a side, you're at $60/person before alcohol, salad, or a dessert. Add in two glasses of wine/cocktail per person and you're at $85. We are not strangers to ridiculous-over-the-top dinners, via places like Binkley's Cave Creek and Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, so this is not a pricing complaint.  Only 1 out of the 4 of us ordered a proper entree. I had two scallops and a salad! One kid had a bowl of soup, that's it. And the other one had 12 oysters and creamed corn side. Bill with tip was nearly $250. A proper meal for each guest would total $100 for the entree + side + salad or appetizer, and two drinks.   I appreciate that the oysters are flown in daily, and I appreciate the attention to detail in the food. The food we had was fantastic. Maybe mix it up and have a few \"lower priced\" entrees with the higher end stuff? To justify this kind of pricing, you have to have a serious competitive advantage. Give the people some bread, or do something to give them a warm and fuzzy feeling -- like they are truly getting a special experience found nowhere else. I don't know what the answer is for this place, but austere ala carte pricing always makes me feel stressed out, and there is no way I could justify a $400 + tip bill for four people on any kind of regular basis. Maybe this is supposed to just be a special occasion kind of restaurant, and not geared toward locals or families. However, I just don't think it's quite special enough - yet - to garner just special occasion guests.   Please, please, please rethink your pricing and menu strategy. We DESPERATELY need a chef-driven restaurant up here, and the food is great!! I would be back in a heartbeat if the menu and pricing was revamped a bit. At this price point, though, I just can't see myself visiting again. I hope to revise my review soon."}
{"text":"WOW! I almost don't want anyone else to know that there is an amazing restaurant in North Scottsdale! We had heard that had good food, but I have to say the service, presentation, quality and amazing tastes of the dishes were all equally wonderful.  Filet was BOOM! Caesar very good, deviled eggs amazing, creamed corn...MMMm good!   Thank you for a great meal and my first 5 star review!"}
{"text":"Would've gave it 5 stars but just couldn't due to the sewer smell walking up. It was a lovely night so front door open but not a good idea. Service at bar outstanding. Crab cakes & shrimp cocktail out of this world. Will we defiantly go again, but please, call the City of Scottsdale and ask for a filter to be put on the closest manhole so we can at least enjoy the smell of food not the sewer."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5, it's one of the best steak places I've been to in a while, I have not been to all the steak places in the area yet, but so far this one is my go to. Great appetizers, and sides, cream corn is amazing. Last time I went I got an Elk burger, also amazing, very fresh and prepared perfect to order. Oh and their selection of Bourbon and Rye's is fantastic"}
{"text":"Decided to give the Bourbon Cellar a try for lunch.  Place was deserted on a Sunday afternoon, chef owner had to wait on us until his \"girl\" got to work (negative stars for that comment from him). Had the filet burger- very dense, not very flavor-able.  Not really what I was expecting from someone that lists their restaurant as an upper end restaurant.  Sticker shock- they charge extra for a slice of onion and pickles.  Seriously!  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great steaks. Great seafood. Excellent service. Enjoyed the scallops and totally loved the filet with blueberry glaze. Will be back."}
{"text":"The Bourbon Cellar is a small strip mall restaurant that specializes by day in house ground gourmet burgers and Chef Crafted Sandwiches. By night they are a Steak and Seafood Restaurant. By day or night you can find a large collection of Bourbon here and several of the dishes they offer are laced with Bourbon.  My review is only based on one lunch visit.  We both decided to try a Ground In House *PRIME* Filet Burger on Apple Cider Egg Buns. Each Burger was topped with a WASABI Deviled Egg topped with a Bourbon Cherry......So yummy and delicious.....WOW! I do have to say the burgers really were amazing with great flavor and lots of juice. Just delicious!  That was the good....I hate to to mention a few things but there are a few reasons why this AMAZING burger of the highest quality and extra bling wasn't 5 stars. Each burger was packed with an enormous amount of mixed greens..So much greens that when you took a bit the burgers exploded just like those toy snake in a can things. Actually everything in my burger popped out...I also think a crunchy lettuce might be better in a burger...But the other main reason was the requested degree of doneness wasn't exactly accurate. I request medium and my burger was a little past medium....not a big deal to me because it was close and still delicious but my husband requested medium rare and got medium well. That one is a big difference. Our waiter was great and did offer to get another burger and he also did apologies for the chef....  The food we tried was VERY GOOD and CERTAINLY way above average.....Almost Excellent!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, there were 2 guys at the bar (1 of the guys was the owner).  We were the only patrons at the restaurant on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 pm.  We ordered a couple of drinks and got started with the wasabi deviled eggs.  The waitress said they were a little spicy and we said, \"great - we like spicy.\"  When the deviled eggs came they were bright green.  I took a bite, and it was very very strong on wasabi as well as super dry and tasted like they were definitely not fresh - possibly a couple of days old and stored in the refrigerator.  While I love deviled eggs, I was only able to swallow 1/2 of one and my husband ate one. The order came with 6 eggs.  We then ordered a wedge salad to share - absolutely nothing special - and again we commented on how it didn't feel fresh.  We opted for one more item - the steak tacos.  When they arrived, we were surprised to see that it wasn't steak - it was ground beef.  Overall, this was one of the very worst dinners we have ever had.    We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"LOVE the atmosphere. Had a client meeting here and was perfect seating for talking without yelling. Food was unique - I loved the dip appetizer - I'm not sure what was in it. A little over priced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Super food!!! Chef Doug is in tune with the farm to table and his clientele. And he's a Veteran. So step it up, and make a trip to The Bourbon Cellar!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place while in the area, so after reading mixed reviews decided to make reservations for a Friday night, which weren't necessary as there we only 2 other tables occupied. The restaurant is divided between a bar area and dining area. Very nice decor and feel; however it is very small and I imagine would be very tight when crowded.   Started with an appetizer of the crab cakes, which are advertised as flown in daily from Prince Edward Island. The sauce it was served with was very pleasant and is what made the dish as good as it was; the cakes themselves left a bit to be desired. The crab cake is mostly filler and there is not a bunch of meat to be found in it, but what was there was very delicious and is real crab. For AZ, these were pretty good  I had the filet mignon with the house peas and garlic mash. The sides were very delicious and probably the best peas I've ever had, as the onions and bacon bits created a very nice combination of flavor. The steak cooked perfectly, very tender and juicy. It was served a blueberry bourbon sauce on top, which wasn't bad, but I believe took away from what was a very nice steak. The sweetness of the sauce was a bit overwhelming.   My girlfriend had the salmon with chili sauce, cream corn, and garlic mash. The corn was decent, but not what was expect, basically just sweet corn is a bowl with some tomatoes. The salmon was excellent, well prepared and the chili sauce on top was full of flavor and pairs well with it.   Overall it was a decent meal, but for the price should have been better and is not quite at the level or a Morton's and those types"}
{"text":"Chef Doug Smith has created an intimate yet delicious top notch restaurant. We ventured in to try something new in the area - we were NOT disappointed !  Our server Dane is just as sweet as can be.  The wine selection is superb ... We arrived a little too late for the little bites menu but found plenty to choose from on the regular menu.  I ordered the scallops - my wife ordered the filet . OMFG!!!! This was by far the most tender and flavorful filet I have ever tasted !( yes she gave me a bite!)  The scallop was delicious as well .  The ingredients are obviously fresh - and it is so apparent that Chef Doug is passionate about his craft  If there is anything to be improved upon -  Please create a signature chocolate martini !!!! We will be back often !"}
{"text":"Very accommodating for a group of 10! I ordered the Sea bass and it is phenomenal. My friends steaks were amazing. Chef Doug and Eric are very personable. The lamb chops, soup, veggies... Everything is amazing! Ask for Sandi! The best server"}
{"text":"I was not as impressed as some of the other yelp reviewers regarding their food.  Our dishes were very average. We started with the crab cakes and there was more breading than crab :(   My husband ordered the Bone-in Cowboy Rib-eye and it was OK.  It defiantly needed more seasoning. The sweet onion bourbon relish was overly boozy and sweet and didn't complement the meat well.  I ordered a fish dish but in writing this review I can't even recall what I had.    Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. This is a great location with lots of parking nearby.  We will return soon and hope for better food experience."}
{"text":"Amazing everything.   Food. Service.  Selection.   If you like Bourbon, enjoy the \"Flight\" and try 4 new choices!   Doug, the owner and chef, is personable and talented - so much so that the steak variety and execution surpasses Maestros, Steak 44, Dominicks and Flemings.   Frank, the resident Barman, is equally personable and professional.   We could not have asked for a better time and better evening."}
{"text":"Freshest seafood in Arizona! I live in Alaska and I had the best Fresh Halibut I've ever had outside of Alaska. Doug Smith, the owner/chef came to our table to chat. He's very personable and humble."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and have actually eaten here twice this week.  We sat at the bar both times. The bartender is very nice.  We had the macaroni and lobster which I can say is excellent. I never thought of Mac and Cheese as something I would order but I totally loved it.  Tonight we had the New York steak....also excellent.    If you are going on the weekend I would recommend reservations if you are looking to get a table."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Saturday night meal. I am a vegetarian and my husband pretty much eats anything.   The hush puppies were awesome. We really enjoyed those. I saw fish tacos on the menu but did not care for salmon. I asked  if the Chef could make me veggie tacos.  Pointed out that there were black beans corn and red peppers listed so those ingredients would make great filler for corn tortilla tacos. I was quite surprised to be served tacos with cold raw veggies in a warm corn tortilla. Our server was very nice and without a scene returned them to the kitchen. By this time, my husband had finished  his sliders and beers. I didn't want anything else because it took so long to be served and we needed to be somewhere. My husband's sliders were over cooked and dry. He also was disappointed.   I apologize for the bad review but I think you need to know what is being served.   I went to Rubios and had a veggie taco. Contemplated buying one and bringing it back to show your chef how easy it is to prepare. Don't mean to come across rude but it is one of the easiest things to make. Good veggies , seasoning and done. As far as the sliders, not sure what happened.   We need more of a variety of restaurants and applaud your effort. Please keep trying.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Very nice to know Doug the owner, we had a very nice welcome with deviled egg appetizer, perfect wasabi spice.  We went with Doug's recommendations and enjoyed every bit...crab cakes, hush puppies and then big filet mignon, cooked perfectly.  Good wine selection and our favorite was the house \"old Manhattan\" a combo of old fashioned and Manhattan.  Our dessert is Chocolate 3 layers cake. We enjoyed ourselves and will be back!"}
{"text":"The owner Doug, is just great! His cooking is fabulous! I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Best crab cakes I've ever had.  Doug is great, very personable and has incredible pride of ownership.  Chicken and filet were mouth watering.  Highly recommended for those in north Scottsdale and cave creek."}
{"text":"My husband is always trying to impress me and he ALMOST never misses the mark. I mean, growing up together, in time, you learn to instinctively know what will and won't get you couch duty lol! I kid, I kid. Truly, my likes are his likes and his are mine; we recognize our life whenever and wherever we see it. We like particular things. For example, We both enjoy a marbled cut of beef and a smooth bourbon that's for sure and BOTH can be found here!  We had just dined in Pasadena a few days prior, at Ruth Chris and felt confident that the tomahawk cut, a ribeye with a French cut, giant lollipop bone, was the best cut we ever shared. Wrong. So wrong. Like, $300 dinner wrong. The 22oz. Farm to table cowboy ribeye with its three + inches of thickness, its marbled and meaty beefiness on a shorter bone that is served here at the Bourbon Cellar is by far the best cut of beef anywhere! We are Impressed that Chef is also the butcher and owner of this fine establishment!  We plan on returning and exploring the menu in both the drinks and entrees!  On top of being blown away by the food, the service we received from Jessica was just as important and appreciated!  In the words of Chris S. , Bourbon Cellar is , \" ... as smooth as TN whiskey, sweet as strawberry wine,  love as warm as a glass of Brandy,  A five star 'love for bourbon cellars' anytime!"}
{"text":"It was the Chef's birthday, so he wasn't in the restaurant that night.  The staff was friendly and service was good.  However, we tried to order two different wines on their menu and they were out.  Our third pick was good, but the server had to get it down from somewhere so it was room temperature.   We were staying at The Boulder's Resort and had excellent food in every venue, so my expectations were high.  For the price, the salad was just okay.  I ordered a starter salad with tomatoes and cranberries as I wanted to try the combo, but there weren't a lot of nuts, tomatoes or cranberries in relation to the lettuce.  I had the pork loin appetizer and it was dry.   That being said, my husband enjoyed his Sea Bass (the server couldn't say if it was Chilean).  He wanted the tacos, but they wouldn't serve one of each protein, so he opted for the Sea Bass.  If we were local, I'd give it another try, but as a visitor, I didn't think the price/value delivered and wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Went there on a very slow weekday, by slow I mean there was no body in there! And when we ordered they said they were out of the sliders and we thought that was hilarious because it looked like we were the only people in there all day! But the salads were good and the lobster Mac and cheese was pretty good. Just wish they would have stated they were out of an item before we decided what to order."}
{"text":"My daughter and I sat at the bar last night.  The food is good, but definitely too pricey.  If we are going out for an expensive dinner, I would choose a different location.  For the location, I would suggest a few things on the menu less pricey."}
{"text":"We both had the (amazingly fresh, perfectly cooked, deliciously prepared) salmon and couldn't be happier. I had the fresh cut fries and loved the softness of them, my sister had red roasted potatoes and found them well flavored, we both loved our veges too (broccoli and peas with bacon, mushrooms and onions). Be sure to ask about their fresh specials not on the menu! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food are phenomenal,  love the oysters and shrimp, and great wine selection.  I don't live in the area, but stop in every time I am...cheers!"}
{"text":"Happened to spot the restaurant as we drove by and were immediately impressed by the chic exterior.  Went last night for dinner and were not disappointed.  Service was very personal and attentive-owner/chef Doug made every effort to make us feel welcome.  The drinks were delicious (smooth margarita for me and excellent bourbon for my husband).  My Alaskan salmon (flown in same day) was divine as were the sides I chose. My husband's 22oz ribeye (hand picked and cut by Doug from a local butcher) was the best steak he'd every enjoyed, tender, flavorful, massive proportion. He savored every bite! Highly recommend this gem of a restaurant for a high quality dinner experience!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit to Chef Douglas's Bourbon Cellar for my birthday!! Great, intimate dining room and attentive service! Bourbon list is extensive...and several selections of wines by the glass at moderate prices.   We both LOVED the lobster Mac-n-cheese and the potato soup. Both starters had so much flavor! The Sea Bass was amazing... Incredibly moist and flavorful and it was big! Grilled asparagus made a great side. All topped off by mini-desserts of just the right size. Definitely a great date destination."}
{"text":"We decided to extend our trip to Scottsdale and found this incredible place!  The food was phenomenal- truly farm to table.  The service was great - very attentive and professional.  The bourbon selection was very extensive and the staff was so helpful in recommending our flights.  The BEST aspect was the time the owner/chef spent with each table and thanking each of us for the business.  A MUST when you're in the area!  We'll certainly be back!!"}
{"text":"First timer, so we started with Jefferson's Ocean Aged Bourbon at Sea with Amarena cherries at the suggestion of Chef Doug.  I had the starter, pork medallion and my honey had the sirloin burger with the daily vegetable side to go with my medallions in a bourbon sauce.  The burger was an amazing presentation and delicious. Must try!  Will be back."}
{"text":"First time eating here the 3 course meal was excellent. We had the wasabi deviled eggs on the pineapple chicken and the green beans with the strawberry cheese cake and coffee for desert. It was perfection in the kitchen. Great job chef."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in AZ! Some of the best food around. Doug the chef is personable and friendly, always taking time to come say hello and offer something special for guests to sample. The lobster mac is out of this world as are the deviled eggs. Try them both. All the meals are done to perfection."}
{"text":"Not what we expected after checking out the previous reviews. First, there was lipstick on our water glass, it happens but not good. Second the drink we ordered was suppose to be made with bourbon but tasted like bad lemon water. Third, we ordered the crab cakes but apparently they had run out although the restaurant was not close to full. We order the pork loin instead but it was super salty to the point we could not eat it. Our server was not very attentive ( perhaps a bit embarrassed by the one after another issues we were having. Plus, it took 40 minutes to get our three appetizers . The Spinach artichoke dip was decent but to me had to much lemon in it. The 3 prawns appetizer was fine. The prawns were firm and tasty. I'm giving it a two star instead of a one star because any restaurant at any time can have an off night. We just happened to catch everything off. I'd give it one more try to see if our meal improves."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Hands down the best burger I've ever had. It's a filet burger and can't be beat! Even served with a deviled egg on top. Doug, the owner and chef, is personable and passionate about what he does. Great food, nice bourbon list, love the ambience and small restaurant feel. We will definitely be back when we are back in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We came here because of word of mouth around the Desert Mountain area and my Grandfather and his Wife wanted to give it a try. It was a good place to meet in the middle us being up in Desert Mountain and them being in Downtown Scottsdale. The drive was not bad for either party and we met at 6:30. We made a reservation (for a party of 6), but it was not needed (in my opinion) for the Wednesday night we went. This could change depending on the night and the time of evening. I would always recommend giving a the restaurant notice for large groups (5+); I consider it common curiosity. Plus The Bourbon Cellar is on the smaller side; but in doing so supply great costumer service and quality ingredients. Great place for an upscale business meeting, large group gatherings, romantic dinner for two, or a family meal.   Our party started with a couple of the chefs starters from the menu. We tried the fresh (flown in daily) Oysters with the fixings served with grilled crostinis, which was different than the usual cracker I'm use to being served with oysters. Homemade/fresh cocktail sauce (made to order) was delectable. I found the combination of the of all the fixings on the (buttery) grilled crostini and the oyster was quite divine and was a very enjoyable experience. I would totally eat oysters here again and anywhere that served them in this way. We also had the Crab Cake I did not get to try any because my father gobbled it up so quickly. My Grandfathers wife enjoyed a small bit. She is picky, so keep that in mind even though she only got a small amount, she still said it was very tasty.  Now for the dinner portion. We had a variety of menu items and sadly everyone forgot to order the \"Vegetable of the Day,\" which was Green Beans with Mushrooms. The Filet Mignon with a Blueberry Glaze was needless to say WOW! It was so tender you could cut with your fork. My Grandfather and Husband were very impressed. I had the Ahi Tuna, which was quite good. It was a large portion (could easily be shared by two), but I felt it slightly lacked flavor. I wish I would of tried the scallops, but still if you are in the mood for something light and healthy give the Ahi a try. I recommend sharing it. I would highly recommend the Filet. The Cream Corn and Cream Spinach were also very good.   For Desert we ordered a few a pass around the table. We tried the Mouse (served with 4 different flavors), the Cheesecake with Carmel Sauce, and the Tiramisu. All 3 were dreamy good. I'm very picky with my deserts and my expectations are HIGH. I enjoyed a little of each one and would be willing to give each one another try if we ever get another chance to eat at The Bourbon Cellar again.  Like mentioned in other reviews The Bourbon Cellar is on the VERY pricy side. Anticipate a steep check at the end even if you do not drink. I would return though and I do recommend this place indeed. Yes, it is exceptional pricy, but you also get what you pay for. It was great service by the waitstaff and the kitchen. I would love to return for another go around. It would have to be a special occasion that is for sure. A special Thank you for wonderful service and a wonderful dinner Chef and Waitstaff.  What I hope to see happen over the course of its Grand Opening is an advertised \"Happy Hour.\" With Oysters so fresh, speciality brews on tap, and Steakhouse and Seafood offered appetizers could be a huge money maker. It would be a great way to bring in the general public who are unable to enjoy the Full Menu prices. Cheers Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Great bar and good bourbon selection. Cocktails we just ok, I ordered a New York and creamed spinach. For the price I was expecting steak house quality. I was quite disappointed in both the cut of New York I received and the side of creamed spinach for the price. Maybe a touch better than a chain restaurant steak. Nowhere close to Mastros or Prestons that are not far away. The creamed spinach...well where was the cream? Was nothing like any cream spinach I have had before. Got to say it was terrible. I'll give 3 starts because they are trying but if you are looking for a steakhouse quality steak...this is not your place."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here today for the first time and really enjoyed it. Ambiance, creative art, and a warm welcome feel. Britney took extraordinary care of us and the food was truly fantastic. We look forward to becoming regulars."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the food and the drinks and the people where just unbelievable!!"}
{"text":"Food is top quality and price point is very reasonable. I really hope the locals frequent this place. Great neighborhood joint. Come casual or dressy...both seem to fit. My boyfriend and I enjoy sitting at the bar as we do at most places.  Chef Doug is personable and works behind the bar interacting with his customers. You tell he's passionate about his place.  We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the decor. Excellent service. You can tell everything is made fresh and to order in house. The filet with blueberry sauce is out of this world! The halibut special was delicious. I loved the fact that you could pick 2 sides for your entree. Yes it is pricey but you pay for what you get. If you want an excellent, good quality dinner with amazing flavors... You must go to Bourbon Cellar!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my family and expected casual dining considering location....and was not disappointed.    However I felt the prices were way out of proportion to quality of food and serving size.  For example, to pay $9 (used website to refresh my memory on cost and thought it was actually a little more expensive on the menu we used at the restaurant) for a side dish of asparagus,  I would have expected a shareable portion not an amount small enough to fit on my entree plate!  I don't mind paying good money for good food, but I don't feel we got our money's worth.    We inquired about what bourbons and scotches were in stock and our server was not knowledgeable nor could a menu be made available when we asked.    Would have liked to become frequent customer since we live close by and enjoy fine dining but I can't get past the sly way our waitress got my 11 year old to order a side dish for the $24 SMALL lobster tail he was getting as his entree!     I wish the restaurant best of luck because there is a lot of potential, hence the 4 stars.  Just sorry things didn't work out with us!"}
{"text":"We went to the Bourbon Cellar on a Saturday evening after finding good reviews on Yelp.  Great locally owned restaurant!   We started with Lobster Mac n cheese and the complimentary hush puppies...YUM.  The lobster Mac has a hint a jalapeño that gives it just the right zing AND it actually isn't too heavy  My husband and I both had filets.  I had creamed spinach and fries, he had fries and broccoli.   Filets came with a wasabi deviled egg on top.   Jessica was our server....she was a total sweetie.  Great personality, attentive and pleasant.   Chef Doug came out to check on us.  It was a pleasure to meet the owner, chef and small business owner.    A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We were there on a Friday night at 7 PM.  To my surprise the restaurant was not very busy.  We ordered the oysters on the half shell, caprice salad and the pretzel sticks.  The oysters were fabulous and we were off to a great start with the food.  Unfortunately, our service was really poor.  To start we didn't have silverware which we had to fetch for ourselves.  The waitress took so long to clear our plates before our salads arrived.  My husband had the soup of the day which looked very unappetizing.  The rest of us had the bourbon cellar house salad.  Next we had our entrees which were the jumbo shrimp wrapped in bacon, the bone-in cowboy ribeye and the filet mignon.  The steaks were fantastic and cooked to perfection.  The cream corn and vegetable of the day were just ok.  Again, our service was almost nonexistent.  We had to ask for refills on drinks, etc.  Again, our plates sat there forever before they were removed from the table.  The vegetable of the day was peas and we had asked for spoons and never received them.  We did spill some peas on the table cloth.  We finally ordered dessert and had a piece of cheesecake, chocolate cake and red velvet cake.  The do not have a pastry chef on staff.  We had to ask the server to clean off the peas so we could eat the desserts without having to look at the peas that were spilled on the table.  The desserts were good.  We didn't feel it was worth what we paid.  For the price point, we expected better service.  I still enjoy Dominick's and Mastro's over The Bourbon Cellar."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a drink and appetizers.  Just happened to notice this place and wanted to catch an evening drink in the area.  Did not eat dinner but looked excellent.  Great service with friendly staff.  My favorite was the owner was present and noticed him thank everyone for their business as they walked out.  Hard to find these days, will be back to try dinner for sure.  Great place!  The hush puppy starter dish was delicious.  Love small places like this, a gem in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place received an average of 4 stars. I should have known it wasn't going to be good when we got there, and the place was almost empty. However, being a Sunday night I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. They had a good selection of bourbon,so my wife and I decided to stay for dinner. When the complimentary hush puppies came out burned, and disgusting, I should have ran for the hills. I ordered the large filet, and thankfully opted for the bouillabaisse stuff on the side(it was gross) and who puts some thick sugary crap on a good steak? I was surprised at how large it was, It was too large to be a filet mignon. It was tough, so tough I actually had to have my wife hold the plate so I could cut my steak. Partially due to the slick table.....but it was ridiculous. The desert we got to go, we were staying at a local resort, and wanted to take it back with us. They put it in a Chinese food take out container, and put the containers in a wadded up Safeway plastic bag. The desert was a hodgepodge of I don't even know what.....covered in 3 or four different syrups(the high fructose corn syrup cheap desert stuff) I would expect something like this from a TGI Fridays....The entire time was was there I was looking for a hidden camera, and halfway expected Gordon Ramsey to step out, and be featured on Kitchen Nightmares.......Whatever you do do not go here to eat, if you want a good bourbon, this might be the place.....This had to be the worst 200 dollar meal My wife and I have ever shared......live and learn I guess."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal tonight. All fresh ingredients cooked to perfection. We found a gem. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I am responding to the rude reply from the chef to our review of our honest experience at this restaurant.   First of all, I am an RN with over 35 years of active health care experience.  It is totally inappropriate for the chef to suggest we get medical treatment based on our experience after consuming the highly over salted/spiced fare that was served.  Btw, we ate at the bar and there were no condiments (salt and pepper) at the bar, so to also assume we were responsible for over salting our food is ridiculous.  And to accuse of us of having medical problems is ridiculous. I don't know what happened in the kitchen, but this was an honest review of how we felt and what happened after eating there.  We were fine before we ate and after a few days, the swelling and fluid retention dissipated. Based on the rude and defensive reply from the chef, we for sure will never return to this establishment or ever recommend anyone else go there.   It is hard to believe that you might even consider this adequate customer service!  really????"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and sadly this will most likely be our last...  food is good not fantastic .. decor is aesthetically pleasant...  service on this last visit was initially good ( since no one else was at bar ) until a young guy  sat at end and became loud and annoying... chatting with the young bartender ...this is okay if you're 20 something and enjoy hearing the giddy bantering with a visiting boy at the end of the bar...   The owner seemed to have a chat ( whispering to her ) with the bartender when the young man became loud ... then things simmered down for a bit ... owner must have left for the evening as we didn't see him again...and  certainly would've mentioned the restroom issue....  The owner that we've met a few times before should stay in the kitchen and leave the socialization up to someone else ..     When I went to the ladies room the handle on the toilet was non-existent.. good thing my grandpa taught me how to lift the lid and pull the chain    When I came back to the bar and mentioned it to one of the bartenders she said there was a sign stating it was out of order.. I said not when I went in and she said oh well ...  in a flipped tone...  ( photo )    Being in a customer service industry myself, I I always try to write positive reviews before negative .. everyone's experiences are different ... I've had a draft for months and wasn't quite sure how we felt about this place ... now we do.   Taking a friend who had never been in before said he wasn't impressed at all..    It's never been busy when we would go and it's unfortunate as it has great potential.. but hoping the 20 something's can afford the menu is a huge hope...  Trying to build a high end clientele with  on a young and inexperienced, unprofessional staff  will be difficult ...   best of luck ...."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  Chef Doug!!!  He has the favor of a Big Town Restaurant with an amazing small town local feeling!!!!  And the food was Spectacular!  A must go to Restaurant!  Thank Chef Doug!!!"}
{"text":"The worst owner ever!! Rude and talks to his staff and customers anyway. He got upset at me because his women's bathroom door almost fell on me and I told him. He told me I was no longer welcomed in his bar! Thank god. My food never came after 20 minutes and I was the only one in the bar! He won't last long here trust me. Even his own staff complained to us about him and his short man attitude"}
{"text":"Went there with some friends on a Friday evening.  Shocked at the high prices for food.  Fish dishes were not tasty at all.  Smelled fishy and that's trouble right there.  Friends that had steak were satisfied but that's about it.   Will not go back."}
