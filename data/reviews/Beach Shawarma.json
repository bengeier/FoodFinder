{"text":"Been here a lot, I usually drop buy during my lunch cycling (depending on my route). Have yet to be disappointed. I either get the chicken or beef schawarma"}
{"text":"I cannot in good conscience keep Beach Shawarma at a 4-star rating.  After my previous visit I went back and the drink fridge was fully stocked. BUT THERE WERE STILL NO DIET DRINKS. A *fully* stocked fridge with a couple dozen different drinks to choose from but not *one* diet choice? Poor business decision.  Secondly, fish was available... but I realized... you know what? It's fantastically bad here. At a $5.99 plate special, don't get me wrong, the price is still right. But I mean... the outside is brown rubber and the inside is pink mush. Only those with my standards deem such things edible.   Thirdly- STOP REFERRING TO THE ITEM ON THE MENU ABOVE YOU AND ASKING ME IF THAT'S WHAT I WANT WHEN I ASK FOR ONE OF THE ITEMS ON YOUR SANDWICH BOARD'S *SPECIALS.* For the reader, allow me to translate: \"Can I have the fish plate\" \"Sure, can I rip you off and sell it to you for the price above me?\" \"No, I saw the sandwich board outside and I am fully aware both the 'special' fish plate and the 'menu' fish plate are the exact same thing, so please give it to me for 3 to 4 dollars cheaper.\" \"Okay.\" I get it, you're running a business. But yo. I've been in here a couple dozen times and when I walk right up and order without even looking at the menu... come on. It's become insulting. Is it because I'm white?   (Next time they ask if I want the 'Menu' fish plate- I have an urge to say... \"I'll take one Special fish plate, and one Menu fish plate.\" And just soak in all the awkwardness that oozes from filling my order, to charging me at the cash register. Never breaking eye contact.)   UPDATE: I have a stomach of iron and it's legitimately upset (never happens). I think the pinkness of that fish was... something not to brush off. smh. Beach Shawarma, don't make me start calling you BS..."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place! Everything I've had, from chicken shawarma to falafel's been pretty awesome. I really enjoy how they make the falafel balls fresh to order, and they've not been placed in a warmer for hours on end."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed when I went to this place. there were so many pickles all you could taste that  the chicken was very dry."}
{"text":"Tried the Monday special of 2 shwarmas for $10. You get what you pay for. Very basic flavour and dire decor in there.  For a couple of dollars more elsewhere, you can get shwarmas with more meat that taste more fresh too."}
{"text":"Huge sized portions and an excellent price too. Everything is so fresh and delicious. The salads and soups are awesome and the sandwiches and dinners are the best I have ever had. Thank you for opening up at this location."}
{"text":"Found it while passing by. Went in because I was hungwy. Afternoon special said Half plate at $6.99. Picked the Fish and got rice and tabule with it. It was really good. Really Flavourful, Generous portions....the $6.99 was huge. Good seating place. Will go back."}
{"text":"Place just opened up.  Finally a shawarma place around my area.  Restaurant is nice and clean, with many tables for seating, use to be a hardware store then a thrift store.    They have some daily 2 for 1 specials for around 8.99 to 9.99.  A little more pricey then the scarborough area, but rent by the beaches is much more expensive, so cut them some slack.  They have the usual stuff, beef, chicken shawarma, and plates of rice.  Food was pretty good, one good sign is that i already had to was one of my T-shirts with the sauce dripping on it.  Nice to see it finally open after seeing months of shawarma posted on the window.  Only thing they need to work on is the speed of service, seems like there's one guy wrapping, while the helpers are talking to each other in the background.  If i had to pick the burrito place or that burger place across the street, i rather pick the shawarma.  UPDATE:price has increase by 1.50 than the image i posted."}
