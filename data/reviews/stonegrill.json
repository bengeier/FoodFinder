{"text":"Was the food good. Sure. Esp. the oatmeal bar. There's no way I will pay $27 a person for it again. It was probably worth 12.99. Good but by no means over the top amazing as a breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"I stopped by here twice for breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast burrito was phenomenal. The jalepeno biscuit and eggs were good but the gravy was a bit bland. The service here is excellent and would recommend this place if you have the chance."}
{"text":"We stopped in early evening last night for our first visit. It wasn't too busy yet and we got a table right away. Service was a bit slow at first but got better. The sweet corn fondue with tortilla chips was excellent. Our entrees, salmon and braised short rib, were very good also. We each had one drink and our bill with gratuity was just under $100. I would definitely recommend this place to others and will most certainly return to try other things."}
{"text":"Favorite destination for breakfast. Granted we were guests at the resort which makes it easier but would drive here for the breakfast buffet if I wasn't. Second year in a row visiting and have made sure to eat breakfast here with my son at least once. Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Clean and relaxing atmosphere; Stepanie (a.k.a. Stephaine), made the whole visit thoroughly enjoyable. With a friendly smile and welcoming demeanor Stepanie provided excellent recommendations  and a receptive atmosphere.   Stephanie and the  staff at Stonegrill embody a customer centric attitude that makes this a must visit venue!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast buffett. Everything was very fresh. We had both lunch and breakfast and they were both great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet. Steep on price but had great selection of food. Omelette station, warm plates, smoked salmon, cereal, fresh fruit and a large baked good section."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and over priced, service was okay. I had shrimp and grits, it should have been called shrimp and grits pur√©e. If staying at resort, save your money and go off property."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by this place.  I know it's a hotel restaurant but they can certainly do better.  The hostesses were completely overwhelmed seating the 7pm reservations that all showed up at the same time!  Imagine that, people with reservations showing up to be seated at their reservation time...sarcasm intended  Once we were seated the server greeted us quickly and was great, seriously he was an asset.  The food however was lacking and of course carried standard hotel restaurant pricing.  I uploaded photos of our chosen entrees.  The Mole was very disappointing, the chicken wasn't tender and the sauce lacked true flavor.  I shouldn't have expected much from a hotel restaurant but this was certainly a letdown of a meal."}
{"text":"Took a good sized group for mom's bday brunch. Great layout. Food was very good. Omelets selection top notch as was the oatmeal bar. Anne our server was very friendly and made the morning fun."}
{"text":"Ordered the brunch buffet! It was pretty good- not a vegas buffet but decent food and fresh. Sat on the patio on a perfect day. However, watch out for the birds on the patio"}
{"text":"Good food.  Had lunch.  Spicy and flavorful.  Service was great.  Had the chicken tacos and chopped salad.  Very fresh and tasty.   Would go back."}
{"text":"Shocked to have an absolutely lovely meal here tonight on the patio. Quesadilla and short ribs were delicious, as well as margaritas and martinis. Lovely setting overlooking the main lawn at hotel and kids running around. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here(most hotels in USA or this hotel) is a joke! I have traveled to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Japan. Many of the 4 or 3 stars hotels there easily beat this one! This hotel charges 27 dollars for a breakfast buffet that only serve breakfast you can get in Denny's breakfast menu (or less) and has zero international appeal. Whoever runs this hotel needs to take a trip to other Asia countries that I mention to see how the Asians do it! If you really want a nice brunch buffet nearby? go to wondering horse buffet in the talking stick casino resort instead !"}
{"text":"As far as resort breakfast/brunches go, this place is pretty solid. I feel foolish that it took me so long to finally go and try it. The menu has a bit of everything on it and the buffet selections are good for the price ($27). We sat outside because it wasn't too hot out yet, but just be aware that if the DJ is up at the pool, you will hear everything they play and say. It isn't loud enough that you have to yell across the table at the people you are dining with, but loud enough that it is more than just \"atmosphere\"."}
{"text":"The Stonegrill was average American diner. If it wasn't for the nice server Jo, I would rate the restaurant only 2 stars. It was not busy and it took at least 45 minutes for our food to come. The chicken enchilada and raised pork was good."}
{"text":"Not that great. I got the Achiote Tofu Bowl.  It was not great at all. It was mushy and too salty. This place is mass produced over priced resort food.  Go somewhere else. Any chain restaurant around will most likely be better."}
{"text":"Logan was the best server I've ever had. The resort and restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. The food was awesome. He was very hospitable and friendly, ensuring every need was tended to properly. The short rib and flan were simply to die for. The posole and churros were delicious as well. Everything came out hot and timely. He always asked as soon as our drinks were about done if we would like another one so we never had to wait for another drink. Anyone would be lucky to have Logan as a server."}
{"text":"Wayyyy over priced! Two burgers and three drinks almost $80 that's a bit much! It was not even the best burger I've ever had. For that go to Diablo burger in Flagstaff Arizona! The place is very clean the wait staff extremely professional and attentive. I would just not order cocktails!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for az restaurant week and we very happy! We were sat outside and really enjoyed the atmosphere and zen music being piped through. They served beers from local az breweries which was a nice touch, I ordered a four peaks peach beer that's one of my faves! For our 1st course I got a salad and my husband got the fondue, both were delicious! Then for the 2nd course we got the short ribs and shrimp and grits and loved both of them. Then had an apple pie and chocolate cake for dessert, again both were yummy. Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive. We really enjoyed our meal and will definite be back!"}
{"text":"Despite being the one person at the table who had an entree that was apparently so difficult to remember (I ordered salmon) I was not served and the waiter ended up returning to our table to me being disgruntled at having to order. Again.  The salmon was fine. The drinks were great (as was table side guacamole) and the venue is beautiful. I likely ate here multiple times because the resort hosted our conference, but all-in-all a nice experience."}
{"text":"Great place especially that it is in the hotel. There is indoor and outdoor seating and on Friday nights, 20 feet away from the outdoor tables is a live band. The service is ok (why I took away the star) and sometimes they are understaffed. However, there are many choices for what to order and there is a children's buffet every night. Even though the service can be bad (it's usually during breakfast/lunch/brunch) the food comes out fast and the servers are friendly. I recommend to anyone staying at the hotel, but because the hotel is a bit farther away from residents, I don't know if it's worth driving out. Also, even if the band is not there, there is seating around a bonfire and there are other lounge chairs. Lastly, for the kids, there is a HUGE lawn where kids can play. (bring your own frisbee, soccer ball, etc.)"}
{"text":"Jo, our server, was fantastic. Great service, food suggestions, etc. shrimp and grits were good, short ribs amazing.  Popovers on point."}
{"text":"The salmon salad was good, as was the iced tea. However, the service was slow and our server messed up our orders and requests.  We were a party of 8 here for a quick lunch during an conference break and ended up with a two-hour lunch. Just beware."}
{"text":"was kind of disappointed..  heard about the tacos here and even saw a Groupon for this place that showcased these \"amazing\" tacos.  needless to say when we got here there were no tacos in sight.  and when we asked about getting some we were sharply denied.  why show pics of food you don't even serve.  seems like false advertising to me, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary this year for dinner. Our waiter was phenomenal and food was out very quickly. I felt it was overpriced for the serving food you receive but it was very tasty."}
{"text":"After being here for a few days I would say this was the best gobaliscious food on JW Marriott Desert Ridge premise. The kids voted it as well. Happy hour cocktails also were solid."}
{"text":"the atmosphere was beautiful on a summer's night while outside on the patio.  The drinks were flowing in and our friends were having a good time.  Now the food, it was OK.  Nothing mind-blowing when we started to chow down.  The drinks and ambiance made it for me that night though."}
{"text":"This place is MEDIOCRE  1st day at the resort. ...for lunch my bro and I split tacos and an enchilada. You think they would knock this out being Arizona. Instead it was meh   Tight for time this evening , we went back thinking lunch was a one off. It wasn't. Dinner was very average.   I'm short, not a bad place for a quick bite. Dont expect any type of memorable meal"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch at 11:45 on a Friday, it didn't start to get busy until noon.  I had the Farm Greens salad, the citrus vinaigrette made this rather  pedestrian salad great.  My friend ordered the Turkey Club with fries, he said it was a good club (a difficult sandwich to mess up), the fries were the best part as they were perfectly fried and piping hot.  The staff was overly solicitous, maybe because they weren't slammed yet.  A nice little place to have lunch if you are staying on the JW Marriott Desert Ridge property."}
{"text":"I am at the Marriott for a convention so I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch and dinner two days in a row. The breakfast is great! Unfortunately the gluten free pancakes are terrible but I applaud them for thinking of gluten-free peeps. I will say the gluten-free doughnut was pretty good.  Lunch I had the tacos and recommend the chicken and steak.  The table side guacamole was fantastic. My steak was a little tough and lacked flavor. For having to eat here so many ti.es in a row they did a good job. Staff was very helpful."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We were guests at the JW Marriott and took advantage of the Stonegrille twice.  Once for dinner and again for breakfast.  The food is quite good.  Not amazing but solid.  At dinner, I had the short rib which was melt in your mouth tender.  My son enjoyed his burger.  My daughter who has a smaller appetite opted for the kids buffet which--to Marriott's credit--wasn't totally junky.  She had a nice piece of salmon on her plate.  Breakfast options are pretty varied.  We ordered from the menu vs opting for the buffet.  Food was nice with special touches--saut√©ed apples on the challah French toast, sweet potato hash vs plain breakfast potatoes.  As well, we a nice little amuse bouche of Greek yogurt with a slice of persimmon and agave drizzle.  Our server (Rita) was excellent.  Oh, and the coffee was hot, plentiful and strong!"}
{"text":"Brunch based review follows...  Jalepeno cheddar biscuits and gravy! Don't order it a la carte. Just go to the $24 buffet and grab it off the counter and then also eat their delicious crispy perfectly sliced bacon, french toast, and crepes. Even though the buffet did not include mimosas, Stone Grill had quite the variety of breakfast foods and made my hubby quite happy.   I ordered... Well, big surprise, the Huevos Rancheros. I loved their ranchero sauce - very flavorful and even on the medium spicy side, so perfect for me! I was afraid it wouldn't be enough when I first got it because the eggs hid everything, but underneath the eggs was my crispy fried tortillas and black beans and oodles of ranchero sauce. One thing that was missing was avocado. Since the waiter asked if there was anything we needed, I asked for avocados! They came out with huge slices of avocado and didn't even charge us for it. I know you're thinking, \"Big deal, no charge for avocado,\" but if you go to Chipotle or even Subway, you get charged extra for avocados or guacamole. Stonegrill gets kudos for appeasing my need for avocados.   They also gave me a little taster of yogurt with freshly sliced mango when waiting for my food. They are now on my list for great breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I paid $18 for a plain bacon cheeseburger.  My burger came with avocado, mustard and lettuce and no bacon or cheese, and it was also overly well done.  Very pricy.  The atmosphere is very nice but then again, if the food is sub par, then that's what matters most."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at this restaurant several times during my stay last month. I tried the fresh salsa and guacamole (salsa had delicious smokey flavor), arizona cheddar fondue, soup (forgot what kind but delicious!!), southwest chopped salad and braised beef short ribs. All absolutely fabulous dishes. The short ribs feel apart as they should. The soup and salad were memorable. The service was just as good. A very pleasant surprise for a hotel restaurant. In addition they had exceptional outside dining areas that had a lovely view. Another reason to stay at this wonderful hotel."}
{"text":"Great service. Salmon fresh and moist,  steak grilled medium perfectly. Would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by our experience here.   We only ate there because I had to do an errand at the hotel and we were starving. We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was quiet so we had our waitresses full attention and she was excellent. The ambiance was nice and a modern vibe. We started with the tableside guacamole which was delicious and I had the quinoa salad for lunch which was also very good. They had a great, super healthy and fresh kids meal for my daughter.   The four-star instead of five rating was simply because I thought it was extremely over priced. We had two adults and a four-year-old. We had the guacamole appetizer, 2 lunch salads and a kids meal. My mom had a coffee, my daughter had water and I had an iced tea and our meal came to over $100 with the tip."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here right before we had to leave for our flight home. I had the frittata and it was amazing! My husband had the breakfast burrito and ate it so quickly I barely even saw it- he said it was delicious. It was right around $30 for both breakfast meals and one cup of coffee. I wish we would have tried dinner here too, we heard good things about it!"}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot. Great decor and cool atmosphere. Price point about right for a resort in Scottsdale. Quick tip: if you get the resort package it comes with a dessert or appetizer for free per entree.   My wife got the salmon and I had the short rib. Both were delicious, prepared correctly, and seasoned to perfection. The short rib was tender and placed on a bed of Mash with veggies. The salmon was pan seared with a sauce, perfect temperature, and not over glazed.   We had the corn queso for the appetizer and the chocolate cake for dessert. Both were adequate, but nothing special.   I would recommend this place to anyone staying at the JW Marriott."}
{"text":"Great food and service.....the three stars is for the 2 dollar sign on Yelp page. This is easily a 3'dollar sign eatery."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant during an event that was held at the Marriott. Overall, the food was good, but what I enjoyed most was the service. My waitress and another young person helped me and they were very sweet."}
{"text":"Servers are extremely polite(they were for our large drunk group :p ) and the food is excellent for vegetarians as well(quesadillas & tofu bowl). Ambience is classy too!"}
{"text":"I was at the Marriott resort hotel where this Stonefire is located.   Because the hotel property is so expansive with so many amenities, my wife and I never really left the hotel during our stay.    So what does that mean?  We dined at Stonefire for breakfast, lunch and dinner!    A bunch of people from my company were in town over these four days, so that also meant that Stonefire was also our meeting place for drinks and appetizers.     When it comes to breakfast:   Morning entree price points are in the $15-18 range, no tip.   If you want the very nice breakfast buffet, it's $22-23 without tip.    On the entree, I tried a short rib and egg dish.   It's served up on a mini skillet, so it stays hot while you're eating it.    This is a very hearty breakfast dish, but it's so damn good.    You might want to try sharing it with people around you.      From what I could tell, just about all of their breakfast dishes are good.   If you're into buffet, I can tell they have a really great, high quality buffet.  But you've obviously paid $23, so it should be really good.    For lunch and dinner, my wife, work people and I did family style.   I can't remember everything, but it was all good, whether it was burgers, fish and chips, fish tacos... They were all good.   When it comes to alcoholic drinks, beware their martinis.   I was drinking vodka martinis with a lemon twist... Which are served in abnormally large martini glasses!   One of my employees ended up having chocolate martinis... 5 of them... And she was definitely in bad shape the next morning.  I had three martinis, and I was a bit woozy, so I was drinking lots of water and Gatorade the next morning.   All in all, Stonefire is great, although the cost is at a premium resort price.   Aside from high prices, the down part is we didn't venture off to try food around Phoenix and Scottsdale.    Oh well.  There will be next time. At which time we'll stay at a smaller hotel property.   That way, we'll be motivated to get out and about town!"}
{"text":"Had a great happy hour and dinner here tonight. Friendly service, good value, and a slightly different take on Mexican food than I'm used to. I especially liked the tofu and quinoa bowl... my wife ordered it and I nearly stole the whole thing because it was so good."}
{"text":"Just had brunch. Two star primarily for food quality compared to cost- ie value. $28 dollars for the buffet. Only the french toast and porridge were passabr. Eggs were sloppy and too dairy intense. Chicken sausage was musty and oversalted. Bill Marriott wins again and yes, that means we lose."}
{"text":"I was staying at the hotel and met a friend and her family for breakfast.  I asked the waiter what he recommended and he gave me a couple of choices, I ended up with Oven baked eggs and short rib* - Braised Cedar River beef, squash, broccoli, tomatoes, Cojita Cheese, it was delicious.  I would recommend that again.  They were busy Sunday morning and seemed to handle everything just fine."}
{"text":"A few things here - one meal I would give 2 1/2 stars and other 3 1/2.   The 2 1/2 was brunch and I will say it was Father's Day so maybe it was more crowded then usual.   The food was ok but the layout of the brunch area was crowded, with lines, people cutting in and out of others.  Just tight and disorganized  I heard they used to have a larger brunch area that was much better.  I would not come back for brunch to be hoarded in the mess.   The lunch we had a few days later was pretty good.  I had the enchiladas which were very good.  The fondue with chips appetizer was also pretty good. Prices are higher being in hotel for a lunch but overall I would return here for another good lunch."}
{"text":"Star of the Breakfast - Prickly Pear & Watermelon Juice! Prickly Pear & Watermelon juice blend Yummy! Standard & unusual breakfast choices on their Sunday brunch menu. We did not go with the buffet. Sat outside in the lovely AZ morning under the awnings & watched guests' kids run around on the green & birds fight over abandoned plates.   We were both happy to find a variety of breakfast foods - my husband had bacon $6, waffle $15, & an egg $4- all perfectly done & me the sweet potato hash $17- too big a serving & rich! I loved seeing a variety of juices - especially something unique. I was thrilled with the intense watermelon & prickly pear juice $6. I also tried a bloody mary $11 but it was too spicy for me. Service was prompt & attentive. It wasn't cheap but given the locale it wasn't awful."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently spent a few days here and we really liked it. The hotel itself had very good to excellent rooms. I always love when there is a separate tub and shower. I will say that the rooms are a little dated and not near as nice or wonderful as the rooms in the JW Marriott in Hanoi...but they are excellent rooms for US rooms. They are going through some remodeling right now, but we were far from it and I am sure that when they are done, things will be even better."}
{"text":"Stayed at this property many times and really like it overall.  The one downside is Stone Grill.  Just poorly ran all the way around.  Understaffed, dirty and over priced. I understand this a premier property for Marriott and I do not expect bargain pricing but the buffet is just underwhelming for the price.  The egg station is poorly located and has no direction for lines, taking or picking up orders etc.  The chef cooking was EXTREMELY slow and that is not something you can afford when the hotel is at capacity on a Sunday morning.  One cook who is slow is not going to be able to service the crowd. Line to sit down yet plenty of open seats.  Even more if they took time to clear the ones that had left.  Literally were 8 tables that I walked past that the diners had left and no one was clearing.   Understaffed in every area, from bus service, to waiters to the kitchen and egg station.  Very very disappointing and unfortunately the only place to eat at the property prior to 1100"}
{"text":"Staying at the Marriott for a conference. We're more of a  than a . So I find a bunch of the food on the pricey side. We were in the room after a day at the pool and the kids had enough leftovers from lunch to do for dinner. My fianc√©e and I on the other hand did not.   I then looked at the inroom dinning menu and quickly decided I didn't want to fork out $40-50 for dinner plus tip I headed down to see what the restaurants and bars had on special.  Nothing appealing so I decided we would would just try an appetizer as we snack throughout the afternoon.    We finally picked the guacamole appetizer for $12. It was okay, but I found the salsa that it came with a bit too hot but mixed with the guacamole it wasn't bad 3:5. Tortilla chips were warmed but plain. Even by takeout standards the service was really fast though.  Still never sure if you tip in a takeout situation."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here. Would actually give 4.5 stars really if that was option. Exceeded our expectations of hotel lunch dining. Service was truly excellent. Posole was flavorful and so were chicken and carnitas tacos. Had guacamole prepared table-side (appetizer free as part of Marriott elite resort fee package) so extra good. Tasteful decor."}
{"text":"We ate there on Saturday night when the restaurant was not crowded at all and received terrible service.  A couple walked in after us and they received their dinners before we even received our salad.  Our entrees were served about two minutes after we received our salad with no explanation or acknowledgement that the dinner should not be served so close to the salad.  While we knew that the food would be very over priced due to the location, it was not worth the price.  The waiter also was not familiar with the happy hour specials.  I definitely would eat off property over eating here again."}
{"text":"We arrived with a group of ten tired and hungry business associates. We were greeted with a big smile by Yvonne.  We ordered a round if drinks and wine for everyone to relax with along with some appetizers. We had lettuce wraps and homemade guacamole - all of which was thoroughly enjoyed.   The popovers were a great surprise and absolutely delicious.  We all ordered different items from Caesar salad to short ribs, everything was cooked to perfection.   Service was top notch, decor is gorgeous, food was delicious.    We had made our reservation on Open a Table and they even called us from the restaurant to ask if we preferred sitting inside or outside.   Not your run of the mill hotel restaurant. A real pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"They made baked eggs with braised short ribs. Outstanding. Even though the waitstaff had not heard that this was available  (we had seen it online), they went to the kitchen to ask if we could have this breakfast item for dinner. One of the chefs said (s)he could do it, and voila it was brought to our table in cast iron pans, perfectly prepared and one of the best dishes we have had having eaten all over the world. Then, to show their appreciation for our interest in their food, the waitstaff comped my espresso. What a lovely gesture. We will be going back to try other things, but we may have to fight with ourselves to because my wife and I just loved this special dish."}
{"text":"First, the positives. The continental breakfast buffet is phenomenal. Fresh fruit was exceptional, a wonderful selection of dried fruits and toppings, a cooler with fresh milk (dairy and soy) and a variety of yogurts (light, regular, greek), gluten-free baked goods were a bit stale but I appreciated having those options. Fresh juices such as watermelon mint were a treat. The achiote tofu bowl was exceptional. It was a hearty vegetarian meal with roasted caulifower, braised tofu, quinoa, kale and more. It had great flavor and the portion size was generous.  Now for the negatives. The service was abysmal. I have eaten here with my family 5 times this week already since we are staying at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge. We have come in the morning, afternoon and evening and the service has been poor every.single.time. The hostesses look annoyed and are quite apathetic. In the morning, my children ordered a kids meal that took 40 minutes to receive. It does NOT take 40 mins to make french toast sticks. The server never returned to our table once. I had to get up and roam the restaurant to find him. When I asked about the meals, he brought them and....wait for it...they were cold. It took another 20+ minutes to track him down and get the check. Each time I found him chatting with other employees. We ate on the outside patio at 3pm. It was not busy at that time with only one other family in sight. I asked for a highchair for my baby and it took 20+ minutes to get a highchair. I had to ask 3 separate people to get a highchair. Drinks weren't refilled (on a 110 degree day) and the server had the audacity to add the gratuity on himself.  I have had better service at Denny's and am so disappointed that this restaurant is inside a JW Marriott. It certainly doesn't do the resort any favors. It has a lot of potential, but the staff needs to be overhauled."}
{"text":"Since this restaurant is located at the JW Marriott, you would expect it to be top notch, but it was not.  We had breakfast their this morning.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros.  They brought out my dish and the eggs were still very raw around the egg yolk.  I don't like to send things back, but I couldn't bring myself to eat raw eggs either.  When they dropped off our meals, they did just that, dropped off the food, never asked if we needed anything.  I had to flag down the hostess to return my dish.  I spent $100 on breakfast for 3 adults.  If you can eat breakfasts elsewhere I would suggest you do so."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the Marriott Desert Ridge Resort. It is one of the few ways to get breakfast without leaving the resort.  The environment is fantastic with great views of the well landscaped exterior.  You can also sit outside (too hot for me). I ate here twice for breakfast.  The receptionist was polite but abrupt.  I had the full breakfast buffet both times ($28). This includes all the juice and coffee and food you could want.  All items were fresh, cold or hot as supposed to be and tasty.  The waitstaff are not very attentive perhaps because the buffet in truly on your own.  I struggled with a rating because the food and atmosphere are top notch, but the pricing is a bit over the top- even for a resort restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't dine by myself often but i did yesterday for lunch. I chose to sit outside in a covered area and had the space all to myself pretty much. I wanted something light so I decided to go with the achiote tofu bowl and a glass of ros√©. The bowl had a good amount of salsa and flavor and it was really good. The waitress asked if I wanted dessert and she suggested a slice of pie after telling her I didn't want anything too sweet. It was a light pumpkin spice mousse pie and very tasty. Service was attentive and I enjoyed the food. Spent about $42; a little pricey for 1 person but oh well. No complaints."}
{"text":"Really good shrimp enchiladas. Good flavors, nice oration size, and really nice service. I will definitely head back there. I enjoyed it greatly."}
{"text":"Accessibility (Parking / Wait Time)  1/1 Star:¬†no wait  _____  Service (Waiter / Cleanness / Ambiance)  1/1 Star:¬†good service. Clean. Relaxing. Outdoor lounge.   _____  Taste (0=Not Edible / 1=Edible / 2=Good (average) / 3=Must Try!)  2/3 Stars:¬†food was good. The braised short rib was really good. The tacos were good.   _____  Overall Experience  4/5 Stars¬†  _____  Last Words  When seated outside. Bird fly around you at day but bugs fly around you at night."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast with my family while staying at the Desert Ridge Marriott. Excellent we'll prepared breakfast. We had the vegetarian omelette, waffles, and pancakes.  Everything was well prepared and presented perfectly. Coffee was excellent.  This is a good place to come for breakfast while on vacation."}
{"text":"Fancy little restaurant in the Desert Ridge area at the Marriott Resort.  When you enter the front Lobby of the Resort, you will go down the steps in front of you and it will be to your left side.   Decor is very nice, clean.  A bit pricey for my taste, not really worth a 20$ burger meal. But it was good food.  the service is also hit or miss, it's your typical high end place with people that are just there to collect a pay check, no extra love or care. just plain normal high end dining. honestly nothing special. so all in all the food is good. if you don't mind the high prices, go on ahead and try this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! The food is surprisingly good for it's low key yet clean atmosphere. The dinner rolls are not on the menu, but they are to die for! Really like their salad. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of four is because the service is not so organized. First of all, they got a lot of people's orders wrong. Secondly, they overcharged people in my party left or right. When I went back to complain about being overcharged, they charged me for the corrected price but never voided the uncorrected charge causing my credit card to be placed on fraud alert and placed on hold. A huge headache for a bunch of incompetent waiters and management. Pretty disappointing for such an amazing JW Marriott..."}
{"text":"There were four of us and I had the best meal. It was the pork and it was fabulous. The service was good. Hunter did a great job. It was a great evening"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my girlfriends since we were enjoying a spa day at the same hotel.  No one was at the hostess stand when we arrived and it wasn't until I started to walk in towards the restaurant when someone finally acknowledged our group of 7.  I ordered their hamburger (no cheese) medium well with french fries.  It was tasty and cooked just the way I liked it.  Our server was nice but he didn't refill our waters often and we honestly didn't see him too much.  I wouldn't eat here again but for convenience, it did it's job."}
