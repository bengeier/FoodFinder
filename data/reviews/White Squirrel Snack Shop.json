{"text":"This long space that once housed Peach Berserk is now the newest space from the White Squirrel coffee guys over from Trinity Bellwoods. Pushing the industrial look to its most basic and an eclectic menu ranging from kimchi fried rice to cubano sandwiches to souvlaki to banh mi, they're certainly aiming to hit everyone.  So far the cubano sandwich was a decent eat. The bread was especially good with it's toasty edges and chewy interior. A solid kind of sandwich with layers of ham, roasted pork, cabbage and cheese. Tasty, though I'd be looking to the next item to try versus re-ordering it quite yet.  Their iced tea, done with chai notes, was quite lovely and not too-sweet. Refreshing and a good twist. Worth a re-order.  What I really wanted to try was their kimchi fried rice. However, it's not ready for prime-time. The rice was mushy (needed drier rice, higher heat in the fry pan, less time in pan - something). Though they don't state it's vegetarian (standard kimchi cannot be considered vegetarian), there is no protein in this dish and instead contains Chinese broccoli and tofu. I made mention of the rice and they spoke of how they were working and will be improving on it. Also would be awesome to throw a fried egg on it. I'm likely hoping too much for a more classical prep of this dish (so my expectation for this will likely not ever be met; both sad for me and unfair to them).  But what I really enjoyed on my walk back, was the ice cream sandwich. The chocolate cookies were done up in almost a ginger snap-like texture and the taste was reminiscent of Oreo. Mashed inside was a scoop of Greg's toasted marshmallow. So delicious and beats the pants off the one I had only the day before. Dangerous knowledge for me.  Love that there are two sizes to many menu options - sometimes, you really do only want a snack. Or, if you're like me, you want to try more than just one thing! Prices are all under $10, with snack sizing around the $6-or-less mark.  Definitely worth a peek in here."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  I was excited about a new lunch place opening up near my work but the quality of the food was a huge let down. Went with a few co-workers and ordered a range of items from the Banh Mi, salad rolls, kimchi rice and tacos and all were poorly put together and missing many ingredients and the place was empty.  Hopfully they can turn things around and step up on the quality."}
{"text":"Just tried their kale/chicken Cobb salad  - very well put together.  Nice take on the Cobb.  They used a blue cheese vinagrette which was lighter than the usual Cobb dressing that most places use.    Tasty!! Would get this again for sure."}
{"text":"The place is weirdly empty all the time, which is why you should absolutely go here instead of lining up outside Bahn Mi Boys across the street and not getting a seat (read my review of them).   I had a few items here, but the Kimchi Rice is the stand-out. Very well put together and nicely falvoured.  I also had the Iranian (I think) sandwich which was very delicious as well.   Five stars for being convenient, inexpensive and very underrated."}
