{"text":"I love this place, the meat is always fresh, and there is also a lot of variety. Honestly you cant find any better butcher shop. Rayan is the best place to go!"}
{"text":"Just excellent. I tried it once now I'm hooked. Very good quality and tasty kebabs. Believe me, you can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommended.  I should add that the above short review is for kebabs you get by kilo to take home. They're just great. But, when it comes to having a sandwich, Boucherie D'orient takes the cup hands down."}

{"text":"Al Rayan is a butcher first and foremost that also has a sweet side business where you can order some grilled meats from their shop and they'll grill it right off their huge charcoal BBQ. That is, if you're willing to wait about 15 minutes or so you can get served some genuinely tasty sandwiches right in front of you during lunch/supper.  There's a variety of meat, mostly tending on the middle eastern type of cuts of meat and marinades (shish-taouk, shawma, kebbe, etc.) but pretty much anything you want can be available. Supporting these smaller business is important as they are the lifeblood of the local economy.  The staff was friendly and cost very reasonable.  Give it a try, it's worth your time... also get dinner at the same time. :)"}
{"text":"I am glad i discovered that place. It is a butcher but also make sandwiches and plates. Freshly prepared and barbecued. Wide selection, you can pick up from the board menu or just chose anything from the fresh raw meat and it will be cooked for you to perfection (beef, lamb, chicken, Veal quail, sausages, are only few that i tried) Friendly stuff will surprise you with some unusual combination if you ask for their advice. Not a place for fancy sit in, only two tables for a quick bit or take away. However the food will just blow your mind and challenge your taste buds. The best place in Montreal / Laval area for BBQ and meat lovers. Definitely recommend it."}
