{"text":"One of my very favorite Madison restaurants!  Every aspect of the dining experience here is consistently great.  The cuisine is imaginative and well presented, the wait staff knowledgable, the bar and wine selection top-notch.  The price is high, for the area, but there is honestly nothing I can think of to complain about.  The restaurant is comfortable and not pretentious."}
{"text":"Stay away, especially on busy nights.  They do not seem to have adequate staff and the food suffers and the service really suffers.  After much too long between courses the hot food came cold and appropriate silverware was not provided.  We had a large group but we were not all served our courses even close to the same time.  We had to ask for bread. We visit Madison often but we'd never eat here again.  The meal was rather expensive but was unsatisfactory in every way.  Discussion with management did not even result in an apology let alone an adjustment on our bill."}
{"text":"while i was pleased with the variety of wines available at harvest, i was even more impressed with the waitstaff's knowledge of wine/food pairings. the recommended museum reserva tempranillo was delicious!   the food was obviously fresh and delicious, and the waitstaff is conscious of serving each course in good time. there's no pressure to finish quickly, allowing guests to savor the flavor.   definitely can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Went here for a special occasion.  The food was EXCELLENT.  Most times I go to a pricier restaurant and when I get the bill, I think, \"Was it really worth it?\"  Not so here.  The chef(s) clearly know what they're doing, and you can tell the ingredients chosen are fresher than fresh, and the meat is so tender and flavorful that it can only be organic/free range.  I felt like I was eating dishes from an Iron Chef competition.  And when we got the bill, I actually thought, \"Wow that's it?\"  I can't believe I haven't found a similar place in my hometown of Chicago yet.  Harvest, are you interested in moving to the Windy City?"}
{"text":"Went for a special occasion dinner and found numerous issues that were surprising flaws in a restaurant that has been open for so long.  It took an eternity for the waiter to take out drink order and then to deliver it, plus one drink was not served on the rocks as ordered.  The 'amuse bouche' that came out next was completely without flavor.  My son ordered squash soup that was supposed to be dressed with a little balsamic vinegar to finish it -- there was so much vinegar on it that the dish was ruined and no one at the table could stand to eat it.  My mother ordered pheasant wrapped in bacon and while the pheasant was good, the bacon was nearly raw.  The menu listed salmon but they were already out of it at 6:30 so they substituted cod in the same preparation -- an odd choice since the two fish are not that similar.  The waiter seemed distracted and ill-trained.  We were not impressed."}
{"text":"After dining at some delightful places in Madison, we were unimpressed with Harvest. We ordered a cheese plate which had three delicious cheeses sprinkled with 5 or so pistachios and a small helping of bread. Our request for more bread was answered reluctantly with a few more slices, still not enough to compliment the portion of cheeses. We split a watermelon salad with chunks of watermelon the size of my fingernail. The flavors did not blend well, and while it sounded refreshing and wonderful in description,  it fell flat. Furthermore, my husband requested cheese on his salad and we were told the kitchen would not meet that request.. The beef tenderloin and gnocchi dishes were wonderful, however, although the portions are very small- certainly this is not a bountiful Harvest. And bread was doled out sparingly with our cheese plate- No dinner rolls here! We found our server to be rather inattentive, and not pleasant. We felt the food was hit or miss, and the dishes we liked were very small portions.There are many wonderful restaurants in Madison brimming with personality. We will not rush back to Harvest."}
{"text":"Really great dining for special nights out. Very unique takes on typical American fare without being overly complicated. My husband and I love it for a romantic night out."}
{"text":"Harvest has been the red head SC to the \"other\" restaurant down the street.  Why compare? Harvest has a clean balanced menu that has food fro everyone. Vegan, got ya covered, No red Meat, no problem. Eat red meat, multiple choices, Pasta, Chicken, Duck, Quack yes they have that on occasion. Although I don't imbibe, the people that I've gone there with have remarked that it's a VG wine list and priced affordably. If you like great food service with a great view and atmosphere all with reasonable prices you'd like this place I do."}
{"text":"I am hesitant to write a poor review for a restaurant as I have been part of the waitstaff in many establishments and know how easily a good night can turn into a bad one, however in this case there is no excuse. Saturday 9/12/15 we had a reservation at Harvest with friends prior to the ironman race. We had never been there, coming from out of town but it was recommended to us as a good place to relax and enjoy \"farm to table\" dining. 6 of us are seated, then we are promptly ignored for the better part of 10 minutes before we are asked if we would like drinks. We order bottle of wine and 15 minutes later we are told they are out of it (very common bottle, found everywhere). Order our food and 30 minutes later it arrives some lukewarm, some hot, one entree does not arrive at all. We are told it is coming. 5 finish our meals and one remains without. We are told by the manager that \"you are going to have to wait because we don't want to serve raw chicken!\" We wait, our server is MIA...we tell them we must go and take the meal to go so they eventually give our one very hungry guest her entree in a bag and we leave. Back at the hotel the bag is opened and we find one piece of chicken not fit for consumption. I phoned the restaurant and they say all the right things, take down my info and tell me the owner will reimburse me, get back to me etc...its been over a week and I am still waiting. Don't go here if you have other options, it's obvious they are not concerned about their patrons experience, only that the check gets paid."}
{"text":"This is the best high end restaurant I've been to in Madison.  There were three of us on a Monday night.  You'd think it would've been dead, but it was pretty busy.    We were there during MACN week which meant there was a special.  We could try three appetizers for $15.  We tried the seafood ceviche, red corn beignets, and Spanish tortilla.  All were good.  The red corn beignets were my favorite though.  Each of us ordered the steak of the day on our server's recommendation (Robbie).  It was fantastic.  Thanks!  We ordered drinks and they kept coming.  Very attentive staff.  We ordered wine and old fashioneds (Wisconsin Cocktail).  All were priced about right for a fancier restaurant.  Wine was about $20/half bottle and old fashioneds were $6."}
{"text":"A perfect meal. From  a delicious  sampler wurst platter to perfectly served scallops. Rib eye steaks cooked to perfection. Also, a course of sun choke soup is not to be missed. Fresh and delicious. Coffee and dessert a must."}
{"text":"This isn't so much an update as a comment. Still haven't heard back from Harvest (terrible CS) and Yelp stated that this is not a recommended review. So I just thought I'd put a comment in here that I'm not some biased bot bashing a place because it's fun. I am a real person who eats out in Madison (and in other places) on a regular basis and my review was, and is, legit."}
{"text":"We went to Harvest for an anniversary dinner and being from out of town (SF Bay Area) we weren't sure what to expect.  Both the food and service were awesome. Our server was very friendly, but not overly friendly, and she gave us great suggestions throughout the meal.  We started off with some steamed mussels which our server paired with a nice Sauvignon Blanc. After that we split a salad which was good and then we moved on to main courses. My wife had the braised Halibut which was fantastic and I had the NY strip. This was the one and only disappointment of the meal. The steak was good, but a bit grainy - perhaps because it was grass fed? However the Malbec that I ordered with it was great :-)  For dessert we split the cheesecake and shared a glass of dessert wine, a Muscatel, which was another suggestion from our server.  Overall we had a great experience and if we are ever back in Madison this will definitely be on our list of places to go."}
{"text":"The foie gras is quite impressive. It seems like they mix cocoa powder(or just chocolate?) into the foie gras, and the combination tastes surprisingly well."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago for dinner before a concert at the ovature center. The food was very good and the service was extremely attentive.   I am tempted to give it 3 stars because I'd rather do 3.5 but I think it is an excellent albeit expensive choice for a romantic dinner. I don't know if I'd go back just because there are so many other great choices downtown but I think it's worth a try if you want a higher end meal with a great view of the capitol."}
{"text":"I had read some poor reviews ans was apprehensive; however my husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The sweet corn soup was decadent and delicious and the chicken entree was wonderful. My husband enjoyed the seafood sausage tagliatelle immensely. The crime brûlée was wonderful, the wine perfect and the stuff was very attentive. A charmingly simple and uncomplicated decor."}
{"text":"This place is sure to, and as I'm seeing below, cause plenty of controversy. It's well known concept is obviously slow cooked all organic foods. Not the kind of life I'm personally going to lead but I applaud the effort and enjoy trying something outside the box.   Harvest is the kind of place you only go for GRPs. Graduations. Rehearsals. Parents. It's an experience almost more than a dinner. Very much involved in the ingredients the preparation, technique, pairings as much as the food. It's for those particularly who are more open-minded. I would say do not come here if you don't have an adventurous or willing palate. You won't like it off the bat and then you'll knock all the efforts put in as just \"weird food in little portions.\"   My experience here was a mix of those who thought it was expensive dog food and those who acted as experts in eating foie gras and squid. Coming in I hadn't had the chance to try some of these fine dishes, while I tried the more exotic options and didn't really care for many of them, I didn't much anticipate to walk away loving duck liver. But as I said GRP. Graduations, Rehearsals, Parents. This is the opportunity to try these things while you can in a smaller city.   If it's your dime and you're more concerned about getting something you know you will enjoy definitely get something more fit for you. I'm just saying don't knock it if you are ignorant or close-minded. I loved the butternut squash soup shot I had. And I had several bits of fish dishes I really enjoyed. The cuts of meat were also flawless.   This was probably the longest meal I've ever had. From the amount of people present, to the courses, to the pacing of the restaurant. Sit back in your fine apparel, talk with those around you, take it ALL in, savor it as one of the more elaborate meals you may ever have. The food is amazingly refined, I may not like liver and shellfish, but this restaurant's food is not the result of a golden calf effect. Really make this most of this if you have the chance, look at the menu beforehand, look some things up, ask questions, and try as much you can. I wish more restaurants could inspire this amount of passion in people."}
{"text":"My evening here was in the private party room for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  We were given a special menu to choose a starter and main dish.  I was torn between the lentil soup and the beet salad to start.  My husband doesn't like lentil soup, so I new I could order it and still eat some of his beet salad.  Both dishes were great, although he didn't share as much of his beet salad as I would have liked:)  Our waitress suggested we go with the steak topped with a spicy salsa verde, so we did and it was melt in your mouth good.  Dessert kind of fell flat with some kind of chocolate cake mound.  The room itself was nothing special, but not a bad place for a private party.  The bartenders and the waitstaff did a good job.  I'd go back to checkout the regular menu."}
{"text":"We recently had our wedding dinner at Harvest and I must it was just fantastic! It was a small group of 30 people and we had  the dinner in one of the private dinner rooms. We literally just picked the menu and gave them the number of guest and that's it! ..the staff took care of everything. The dinner space looked  very nice and welcoming. We did not have any flowers at the table and the staff took care of the shortcoming by placing just the right number of candles to give the whole room a very nice look.The food was amazing! our guests had a wonderful time.Thanks so much Tami and Veronica, you  took care of everything to make the evening so special for us."}
{"text":"We've been to Harvest several times now, and every time we return I wonder why. The concept is wonderful, the menu inviting and the service is great. However, the food is just O.K.. It isn't bad, but it isn't good. I've yet to have anything that I want more of.  I really, really want to love this place, but I can't seem to. I wouldn't tell anyone not to go, but I would recommend you put your time and money into finding someplace that has delightful food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fine dining spot in Madison. The food and service are outstanding, and the ambiance is perfect--warm and elegant, but not too stuffy."}
{"text":"Harvest was a terrible experience.  The hostess was extremely nice but our waiter made us feel like second class citizens.  Our drinks were not to order and the cocktails were a disappointment.  The first course lacked pizzaz and flavor for the dollar value placed upon it.  The main course took an hour to arrive and wasn't worth the wait.  Luckily they took it off our bill but it still didn't make up for the poor performance."}
{"text":"Nous avons dîné le 27 août 2012 dans ce restaurant  L'accueil était très sympathique.  La terrasse était très agréable ; le soir la circulation étant tolérable.  Les plats étaient très bien présentés.  Le mako était très bon bien que, à notre goût, un peu sec, voire un peu trop épicé, comme les gnocchis.  La crème brûlée était correcte, sans plus.  Pour un restaurant américain, nous étions plutôt satisfait.  Les prix étaient comparables à ceux de la France.  Comme dans tous les restaurant de la région, on nous a servi un grand verre d'eau sentant bon l'eau de javel avec une bonne dose de glaçons.  La bière était bonne et le vin blanc de Nouvelle Zélande correct. La carte des vins comme celle des dessert était réduite.  Nous pensons que ce restaurant est à recommander."}
{"text":"Was my first experience there for restaurant week and I was highly disappointed. My sisters and I made a trip down to Madison for a day trip and made reservations for dinner at 5:30. When we got there, we're weren't greeted kindly at all, the host just stared at us as if we were lost. When we were seated, our server was rushing us to order while other people around us got to take their time to look at the menu. Long story short, the soup was cold and the meat was way too dry. Our waiter barely came to check on our table as she did the other tables. When she came to refill our glasses, she kept splashing the water out of the cup onto the table without apologizing. After paying our bill and getting ready to leave, my sister noticed that all the other tables were offered bread but ours. It's disappointing because I heard so many great things about this place and to go and be treated the way my sisters and I were."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Harvest Restaurant in a few years. I dine out fairly often, but I hadn't had good experiences with the service at Harvest in the past.  Last night I decided to give this place another try, primarily because of its proximity to the theater (which we were headed to afterward).  Besides it had been a few years. I assumed that if they were still around after all this time, maybe they had figured out the issues with service.  My dinner guest and I were immediately taken back by the cold nature of the maître d'.  She was straightening out her work area when we entered. And it took her an uncomfortable amount of time to acknowledge our presence. When she did, the greeting was rather perfunctory- not rude, just apathetic.    It was 7pm on a Friday. In my experience, that's usually a busy time at restaurants. There was a line running out the door for the mid-range restaurant next door which had a 30 minute wait.  Harvest has a higher-end menu & was only about 50% filled.  We looked at each other quizzically as the maître d' appeared to struggle with where she could seat us. The place was HALF EMPTY??  It appeared they were well staffed, but we were seated maybe ten minutes before our server came to the table. I guess I am accustomed to a more immediate greeting when a restaurant isn't busy.  I did not see a sommelier, but I'd think SOMEONE could have stopped by during this time-  if only to get our drink order.  While we waited, we noticed the decor which was quietly sophisticated.  White table linens, a formal place setting & slightly subdued lighting made for an inviting atmosphere. It was ALMOST romantic, but the lighting was a bit too bright for that.  Even though it's close to Christmas, there was an air of restraint with the holiday decorations. There was just a simple strand of cranberries running across the wall- near the ceiling.  So many places overdo the holiday trinkets this time of year. We thought this approach was more refined.  Our server was helpful & friendly with a demeanor that was appropriate to the elegant atmosphere. She had recommendations about what we should order based on our preferences.  And those recommendations seemed to make sense. The wine & liquor menus were extensive.  They even had my favorite bourbon- which is not all that easy to find.  The prices are pretty much what you would expect for a higher-end place.    We were served a \"tasting\" of soup, compliments of the chef.  It was very good and I wished I had just ordered that for dinner.  But I had already ordered a locally-sourced New York Strip Special that was not on the menu. To my disappointment, it arrived at almost  ROOM TEMPERATURE.  I had to wonder how long it had been sitting back there waiting to be delivered to the table.  It was perfectly seasoned.  I'm sure it would have been very good if it had been served while it was warm.  My dinner companion ordered the Wild Striped Bass.  When she made the order, the server was careful to explain that the chef prepares this with the skin on it- meant to be eaten with the skin.  It arrived beautifully presented & she liked it.  She also ordered the Harvest Martini which was a hit. It was spiced with cardamom and was very appropriate for the season.  We noticed that many of the other diners appeared to be from out of town.  As a local, I have always liked the philosophy of Harvest (farm-to-table using organic, locally sourced ingredients) .  But the failures in service that I have experienced there are just not what I expect from a fine dining experience. ----"}
{"text":"One of the best meals you can get in Madison. Everything on the menu is incredible. They use fresh local ingredients to make really classic yet complex dishes.  I've never had a meal that didnt knock my socks off. I wish i could give six stars!  Highly recommend the seasonal sides, scallops, and pasta but everything here is good."}
{"text":"Forget the negative reviews. Just go.   Great service from Molly, nice cocktails, well presented plates, and fresh ingredients make for an awesome meal.   Definitely get the polenta, anything butternut squash, and since most dishes change with the seasonal menu, lookout for mole additions to protein (delicious)."}
{"text":"For the money I have had far better food. Everything was either bland or overpowered by a badly designed sauce.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"The dessert  here is absolutely amazing! I can't really say much about everything else but I am very happy we got dessert. My partner and I got the chocolate pecan ganache tart and carrot cake with cream cheese ice cream and both were not too sweet and nicely portioned, a good way to end dinner."}
{"text":"The problem may have been that I did not order what the server recommended. I attended a corporate event here, and just about everything was incredibly bland. What did stand out: the kim chi with the roasted chicken was outstanding. I've never had moister chicken. Good pinot noir. Very nice, unobtrusive servers. Good view of the Capitol.  Not a place I'd return to if I had to pay though."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I was very excited to take my parents to Harvest, remembering my last good meal there. My mother had the osso buco and she couldn't eat it because it was so salty. Our waiter was incredibly rude.  The entire experience, bad food, bad waiter, extremely high price, turned me off this restaurant for good. Too bad."}
{"text":"we just had a fantastic experience at Harvest and I had to rave about it! our view from the private room on the 2nd floor was breathtaking. every bite of food was amazing and I am so thankful for such delicious vegetarian options! our servers were attentive and helpful. thank you for an unforgettable evening."}
{"text":"While the food was delicious, service was very disappointing to say the least. There are restaurants with equally good food and much better service."}
{"text":"This is probably not a fair review because I did not actually dine here... but I feel like I need to share my story anyway.  My girlfriend and I were trying to find a dinner spot before we went to see a movie on a weekend night and poor planning had us looking at several restaurants around the Capitol with one hour+ wait times. We walked in to Harvest and were told we could be seated immediately which was wonderful news.  Before we were taken to a table, another potential customer behind us asked for a menu, which prompted us to ask for one too, to get an idea of what we were looking at. A quick glance revealed that the menu was a little pricier than we had hoped to spend. If you are going to eat at restaurant with a price-level like Harvest, you don't want to \"power\" through the meal to make it to a showtime.  We told the hostess that we were sorry, but we were going to keep looking, which prompted her to respond, \"This is why we post the menu outside, so you know what is on it, and you can decide whether or not to come in...\" Wow. You post the menu outside to ward off \"poor people\"?   This was very disappointing and I am going to seriously think twice about eating here in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Madison for the weekend. We both went to school at UW-Madison, so we know the area and the restaurants really well, but had never been to Harvest (mostly because it's a little out of a college student's budget). We were deciding between L'Etoile and Harvest and ended up choosing Harvest because the menu looked more well-rounded. We could not have been more pleased.   The atmosphere is elegant, relaxed and comfortable. We were immediately greeted and seated and the waitstaff were wonderful throughout the meal - especially when my boyfriend knocked over the bowl of sugar cubes and sent them flying through the restaurant!   To start, we were brought a complimentary Amuse Bouche of Chilled Asparagus Soup in a tiny terrine that was very tasty! For our first courses, we had a Minestrone Soup with big chunks of fresh veggies and a Beet Salad with Goat Cheese and Toasted Macadamia Nuts that was amazing. For the main course, I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the short ribs and both were stellar - filled with fresh, seasonal, flavorful ingredients.   We splurged and got the cheese plate (how can you not in Wisconsin??) and had some really delicious cheeses served with warm olive bread and fruit spread.   For dessert we had the Strawberry Mousse with tiny wild strawberries on top and a cup of some of the best mint tea I've ever had.   I cannot say enough good things about Harvest. Totally worth a trip to Madison and perfect for a special occasion! I didn't mind paying a little more considering the high-quality ingredients and found it totally comparable to a nice steak house in Chicago. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We visited Harvest for the first night of restaurant week, and we were so happy with our choice! We showed up about 15 minutes early for our reservation but were seated immediately, with our server stopping by right away as well. Throughout the night, the service was attentive and friendly despite our having a later reservation on what seemed to have been a busy night. We ordered cocktails to start, and while I can't remember their exact menu names, my husband's sidecar was crisp and well balanced, and my Door County cherry martini was dangerously delicious.  As for the food, the appetizers we chose (the bacon-potato salad and the watermelon feta salad) were were great but not necessarily mind blowing. However, our entrees (the pork shoulder and braised beef short ribs) were perfectly cooked. The meat was well seasoned and tender. The beef portion was especially generous, but I still found myself eating every bite.  We were both a little too full to full enjoy our desserts- cherry lime sorbet and chocolate espresso pie- but what we did taste was divine as well.   While due to pricing and convenience Harvest probably won't be one of our regular spots, it definitely earned a place at the top of our special occasion restaurant list!"}
{"text":"Run out of Steak and Pork on a football weekend?  Wow.  And then offer a $46 entre as a mnu substitute? Wow. Turned into a $200 chicken dinner."}
{"text":"We are frequent diners in the Madison resturant scene. Had not eaten at Harvest for 5-6 years. So incredibly disappointed. Starters, salads and a soup were all wonderful. Three of our four main courses were inedible. The pork which came highly recommended was so tough we ate 10% .  The hangers steak ordered medium had to be sent back it was so rare. Even when replaced it was still very rare.  Never offered dessert or coffee. Both when we arrived and left there was no greeting from servers or host.  I truly feel we wasted $300 and a precious evening in our beloved Madison. We had a family wedding receptions at Harvest 10 years ago and everything was fabulous. How far they have fallen!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted a splurge for our 1 year anniversary, and he chose Harvest.  It was perfect.  Just the right amount of elegance without being overly pompous.  Our server was Australian and amazing, we noticed that she always appeared when needed and never bothered us when we didn't need her - she knew exactly when to approach our table.    The atmosphere is very classy, elegant but comfortable (ie very small and candle-lit lighting with mismatched chairs and exposed piping in the ceiling).  Very date oriented - most were couples or 4 tops.  Portions are on the smaller side, but exquisitely planned and extremely tasty.  The menu is very small - there are not many choices for appetizers and entrees.  There are no complaints about any of our food.  For appetizers, I had a green salad that I still think about (walnut-sherry vinaigrette - yum!) and my boyfriend had a squid salad.  Even the bread on the table was delicious, and they serve a small portion of soup on the house.  I got the special strip steak entree with mashed potatoes and my boyfriend got the tenderloin ($36).  For dessert they were out of the only chocolate item (some cake I think) and so we split the fruit tart, which was unique and delectable.  You can really taste the quality of the ingredients in all of the food, which is I think nearly 100% local.  The beef was grass-fed and my boyfriend said it was the best steak he had ever had.  I had two glasses of wine and my boyfriend had a beer and a glass of wine - I think our total with tip was about $170-180.  Wine ranges about 8-9$ a glass, there are more bottles to choose from than glasses and they are at varying prices.  I know there was a drink menu but I prefer wine with dinner.  I don't know about parking, we walked because it is on campus right next to Old Fashioned, but there are few meters in front.   I would definitely go again - it's a splurge, and with the small menu I would say it's not a place I would go often but definitely for those special occasions once in a while."}
{"text":"If you like your meal with a side of arrogance, this is your place.    Waited 45 minutes after our reservation time to sit down.  Asked for a complimentary bottle of wine for our frustration and was flatly refused.  And there was no one else to whom to plead my case, as I was speaking to the owner.  This was after I received an e-mail from said owner the previous week saying that if I was more than 15 minutes late, I would lose my $100 deposit!    In sum, if I make them wait for 15 minutes, I lose $100, if they make me wait for 45, they lose nothing.  Well, nothing except the business of all my friends, and hopefully Yelp readers."}
{"text":"Sometimes I think rating a place after one visit is unfair. But then sometimes I think it should only be unfair for brand new spots or places word of mouth will tell you is hit or miss. Either way harvest seems like it could be 4 star worthy for me, but I had a 3 star dining experience.   The atmosphere is lovely; classic white linens and preset dinner tables. Incredible hospitality from both the host and waitstaff as they hung coats upon entry and seated us.   four my first course I ordered seared scallops with whipped sweet potatoes and parsnips I believe. Superb. Scallops were impeccable in texture and flavor. So why the 3? Main course. I ordered the braised sturgeon in a coconut sesame SAUCE. I emphasize the word 'sauce' because I traditionally think of a cream or something similarly adhesive to the protein. Not so. The sturgeon was nicely cooked, but had not been salted at all. And the 'sauce' came out as a platter full of BROTH with my sturgeon sitting like an island in the middle. The coconut flavor was subtle on the brink of tasteless. And the poor potatoes and fennel were also swimming in this broth. No distinction of flavor on the plate. I was just a bit disappointed.   Oh, the chef offered an amuse-bouche of a butternut squash purée which was also very tasty. This is why I feel it surely could be 4 stars. But you can't falter on the main!  I shall return to allow redemption."}
{"text":"We would have liked to give a better review, but there were a number of glitches in the meal/service.  First, it was a hot evening and we were looking forward to a cold rose' wine.  The menu showed it by the glass but the server said we were reviewing an old menu and none was available.  Then we ordered the shaved cucumber salad as a starter, no cucumbers so no salad!  Their comment....we had a busy evening and it sold out.  The server kept pressing us to order the scallops and didn't give us much feedback on the other dishes we were inquiring about.  Also they ran out of rolls during dinner but finally arrived with a fresh batch.  The last straw in a less than stellar dining experience was the \"unordered\" glass of wine on our bill.  No apologies and no compensation of a free desert or something for the various issues.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week, so it's possible the food was not up to its normal standards. We had the soup and salad to start--both of these were good, but nothing special. For the main course we had the beef short ribs and the pasta. The beef was ok, but the pasta was pretty terrible. It was basically just spätzel with cream sauce and was something I could make at home very easily (and probably better). For dessert we had the panna cotta, which was good, and the pound cake which was terrible (the texture was weird, it was really bland and had a weird aftertaste). We also didn't enjoy the cocktails we had. They were boozy, but the flavors were just so unbalanced and weird. For the amount of money this place costs, I'd rather go to Graze or Sardine."}
{"text":"Great wine selection along with some dynamite craft cocktails.  Food was fresh and as good as advertised.  Had the seasonal mushrooms, hangar steak and apple salad. Highly recommend this white table cloth establishment that has no attitude and is a food first place. Service was exceptional as well.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations going into Harvest. I like the whole slow food and local food movement thing, but I also like having a good dining experience. The service was really slow (not like slow food slow, just bad and lacking water refills). And the meal itself was not worth what I paid, and my entree was severely over-salted."}
{"text":"I decided to leave a review here after recalling an awful dinner at Harvest. It was my birthday, and my husband opted for Harvest based on reviews that mentioned the romantic atmosphere and supposedly good food. We're very well traveled, so we've had a good number of culinary experiences. Both of us had ordered the steak, and the chef made the worst possible mistake - over-salting. Someone probably emptied a whole salt shaker into our food, or it was accidentally salted more than once. Whatever the reason, this involves very basic culinary knowledge. It has nothing to do with luck nor high expectations. A mistake such as this renders a restaurant trivial, more so if it charges $30 for it. I was already wary of the Hostess (as other reviewers have mentioned), so I only mentioned our displeasure as we left. We got a cold look, \"you should have told us earlier\", and turned away.  It was a complete waste of our money."}
{"text":"The staff at Harvest took exceptional care of our party of 12.  Their private dining accommodations were perfect for our needs. The food, location, atmosphere, view, conversation and service were all lovely.  They provided a menu that featured options suitable for all members of our party.  We were very pleased with Harvest."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Madison. Started w a unique aperitif (what's that) followed by awesome scallop starter and excellent red snapper & salmon entree. Could \"feel\" the localness and the attention. Kate was very attentive"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Harvest. The food was very good...nice presentation, solid. My husband had the asparagus soup and the hangar steak entree. I had the asparagus soup, foie gras starter and scallop appetizer as my entree.  Hostess/manager was very good and professional. Our server was a nice young man..seemed like a student, as all the servers did. I don't have a problem with this but for the price point, he needed polishing. He didn't know the wine list and admitted this, but served my husband a half bottle for $28 with a different name & didn't explain it. We had to ask and he said he thought it was weird too but apparently it's the same vineyard?  All on all, decent experience, but the service didn't do the food justice."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I've been there 1-2 times a year for the last 5 years or so, and the food is always amazing.  Look on their website for their special event dinners - I went to a 6-course Morel Mushroom dinner a while back that was one of the most memorable meals I've ever had.  The special event dinners are pricey, but very reasonable when you think about the number of courses you're having.  Harvest is definitely a special-occasion restaurant.  And any time you see soup or puree on the menu, get it!  There's always a delicious punch of flavors, and often truffle oil or one of those other \"make me more delicious\" components.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This is a nice unpretentious restaurant with really good food.  I was in Madison from the SF Bay area on business for several nights and had two just \"OK\" dinners at places chosen from reviews on Yelp.  I was looking for a reasonable meal and nice atmosphere probably like everyone else.  I finally hit the streets and walked by Harvest and the menu brought me in.  I had a nice halibut dinner, good glass of wine and sorbet for dessert - nicely prepared and a perfectly sized meal at a price point I expected.  It was as close to being at a restaurant near home as I found in Madison, really!  In addition, every person on the wait staff was very attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Honestly I would say 4.5 stars since there are a few things that need improvement (discussed later) but I'm rounding up to make up for all the 1-2 star peeps who clearly have skewed expectations, bad attitudes, or both.  I've eaten at Harvest twice in the last two months:  December was a lavish dinner in all respects.   I also ate here with 5 friends during restaurant week 2010.  Thus I think I can provide some unique insights.  The constants for me during both dinners were:  impeccable service, great wine list (which incidentally had been revamped with many new budget friendly bottles when I came for restaurant week), and simple, clean flavors.   Yes, during restaurant week, the menu evolved to accommodate the throngs of diners at the $25 price they demand.  I enjoyed my short ribs immensely.  Tender, slow braised (sorry Gina S., but this preparation takes way over 30min by any means known to man), full of flavor.  Roasted beets were delicious although I could have used more of the mascarpone.  Apple crisp was drizzled in delicious creamy goodness and a was a nice ending.  Portions were ample.  If you want to pig-out, go to friggin Taco Hell where you can most assuredly get 25 \"new!!\" bean and cheese burritos.    If you want the full experience though, you have to pay the full price (i.e. save some scrillah and go at a time not equal to restaurant week).  In December it went like this:  Bomb scallops, steamed clams as good as I've had on the coast, arctic char cooked to perfection, creative cocktails, slammin $90 amarone, absinthe served the right way, chocolate cake, caramel ice-cream...la la la.  Makes me fat and happy just reminiscing.    Finally, my gripes: 1.  The cocktails are good for the average joe, but generally too sweet for the afficionado.  2.  My steak.  By all accounts a testament to what beef should be - grass-fed, cooked perfectly, sauce yummy, but salt....salt it could have used a bit more of.  Also, I think it was $42 that evening and I feel that's a bit lofty.  Having dined temples of beef around the nation, it's certainly at the upper end of the spectrum.    Moral of the story:  enjoy your $25 restaurant week meal for what it is - a tasty 3 course dinner at a rock bottom price.  Then go back sometime and sample the bounty, the service, and all the fine wines when you've got cash to burn.  Else, burrito."}
{"text":"We dined here on a Friday night and found our experience to be very similar to that of another reviewer, Jess L. (7/19 review).  The food and the service were solid, but not perfect.  We found the prices fair and would consider dining here again.  The highlights were the halibut and the cheese plate.  The octopus and squid first course was slightly overcooked."}
{"text":"Atrocious customer service. If you can't handle the pressure of \"Restaurant Week\" then perhaps you should reconsider participating in it. The self-proclaimed \"maitre'd\" harrassed customers, and whether Veronica is aware of it or not, she comes off as completely passive-aggressive and unprofessional. A restaurant of this supposed caliber should not have people at the helm who haven't the slightest clue when it comes to customer service. Harvest should seriously reconsider the employment of an individual who will only drive business into the ground by destroying it's reputation."}
{"text":"Lentil soup, Cavatelli with walnut pesto, hazelnut chocolate cake, wine coffee, great conversation.  Yum!  Second time I've been here, second time they're a winner in my book.  (It was also the second time I've eaten here on the company dime, FWIW)."}
{"text":"I work in the service industry and I converse with many people daily. After hearing many opinions about Harvest, we decided to try it during restaurant week. The person I went with had been before and enjoyed it, so it was my first time...and I was hopeful. They were really busy, to be expected. But let me just say this, restaurant week is your chance to shine and impress people who are in town for business, new to town, or first timers in general. You should be at the top of your game. I'll cut to the chase...our waitress was SUPER awkward, our drinks we really good, my food (I had pork belly over jalapeno cornbread) was barely warm and stale..also lacked flavor, my partner's food (she had beef ribs) was hot but extremely salty. My dessert was a chocolate espresso thing that looked and tasted like a chocolate pudding snack pack. I'll give them a second shot someday maybe, but I'm not in a rush to do so, or recommend Harvest to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner sitting outside across from the Capitol. The weather seemed great when we started, but the food was so distractingly enjoyable that we didn't notice the approaching downpour until it hit. The staff was wonderful, quickly moving us and our meals and beverages to a drier spot in a heartbeat. They execute the sustainable farm-to-table concept very well, making no compromises in preparation and presentation. The pate I had for a starter was excellent, as were the braised short ribs. Wine choices were good and reasonably priced. Aside from rescuing us  from the rain, service was top notch all the way through our meal: attentive, knowledgeable, non-intrusive. Plus they were so welcoming to our pooch, who joined us for the al fresco dining."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently came in for the first time for drinks and ended up getting an appetizer as well.   The cocktails were delicious and the food amazing, but that's not why I'm giving them five stars.  For a Saturday night the atmosphere was very nice - laid back, full but not packed.  We were sitting at the bar and I felt like every server at some point asked us if we needed anything.  It was a welcome relief from most restaurants on the square at this time, but that's not the reason I'm giving them five stars.  The service was absolutely amazing and it felt very personal.  When my boyfriend ordered a certain wine, the server gave him a recommendation for what he deemed a much better wine.  My boyfriend went with the suggestion and the server ended up giving him a taste of both wines first so he could see the difference.  Apparently he was correct about the wines.  But this, and the other great service we experienced, is not why I'm giving them five stars.  The reason I so highly recommend this place is because, halfway through our drinks one of the servers gently led a homeless man up to the bar next to us and bought him a hot coffee and a cookie.  She let him warm up for a few minutes and treated him with so much compassion that it nearly brought me to tears.  This, more than the great food, drinks, ambiance, and service, is why I plan on going back."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend there for dinner on a Saturday night.  Overall, dinner and service was good, not great.  However, I eat out a lot and for me to say \"good\" is just that.  I would definitely return.  My GF ordered a salad and two different appetizers for dinner, I can't remember what both of them where but she ordered the mussels which were bad.  Not a big deal...these things happen and once we pointed it out to the waitress, they were taken away and removed from the bill.  The manager stopped by to apologize and while it was appreciated, it wasn't necessary.  As I said, things like that happen with shell fish.  To be clear, when I said they were bad, they were BAD as in not fit for consumption.  I had the quail and it was delicious.  I also had beef short ribs for the entree and it was fantastic.  What I really like about the place is the low mark up on wines.  We had a 2006 Pride Cabernet and it was priced just barely above retail.  Being a wine geek, I can't stand paying 300% markups on wine.  Anyway, I would recommend this place to others and will return."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here 5 years ago and it was simply amazing. We decided to come back last night for our anniversary dinner, and left disappointed.  In scrolling through the reviews now, I realize that the place has had the same issues for years, which speaks to a management issue more than anything else. We had an 8:00 reservation. Our waiter was kind and attentive, and the restaurant extremely busy, but they were out of all four menu items that we wanted. Oooookay, guess I'll have the chicken.... My husband had the pork tenderloin.  Here's where the experience gets very aggravating. We waited an hour for even our appetizer to show up. This was after my husband sternly asked the waiter what was going on. The couple at the table next to us were half done with their entrees by this time and they were seated at least 15 minutes after us. The waiter said it was the kitchen's fault and offered us a free dessert. Fine. The appetizer showed up shortly thereafter. Another 20 minutes later, our entrees and sides showed up - mixed greens and pomme frites. The food was flavorful and would have been more so if the food was warm... It was barely warm and we were so hungry by this time that it we couldn't handle sending it back.  I had the truffles and my husband had some  sort of chocolate mousse for dessert. My truffles were nice, his mousse was very heavy and rich. While we were finishing up, I overheard the waiter at the table behind us explaining that the kitchen was busy and sorry for the trouble, here is a free dessert.  At the end of the night, we ended up getting our appetizer, dessert, a glass of wine, a glass of beer, and decaf coffee for free, without asking.   I don't mind paying an arm and a leg for superb food and service. Harvest does not live up to its price point at this time."}
{"text":"This is maybe my fourth one star review for this place. It's amazing how this place continues to disappoint. The list of negatives keeps growing. This one focuses on the food. Their dishes are simply uninspiring. This place belongs in the lobby of a hotel. Where there is a certain degree of fakeness and you know your being taken advantage of. So many great places in Madison not sure why anyone would pick this place."}
{"text":"This is the perfect restaurant if you want a balance between the pomp of L'Etoile and your normal Madison fare. I have been there on several occasions (mostly for special occasions). This restaurant is best kept for dinner with a friend/sig other or a small group of around 4, as that is the environment they tailor towards.   The chef combines fresh ingredients with a modern American inspiration to create a menu that is approachable, yet full of surprises (especially in the spices he manages to tuck into various dishes). I find that I walk out every time perfectly content...not too full, not hungry.   Please, please, please take advantage of the wine list! The owner, who has stopped by my table on 2 separate occasions, has clearly put thought into it. Servers are friendly, non-pretentious, and know when to back off.  Give this place a try!   ***** On a side note, I have noticed that a lot of the so-so reviews on here seem to stem from a misunderstanding of how fine dining works. This is not a place that you'll be in and out in 30 minutes, expect to have an experience. There are not waiters simply 'walking around because,' those are mostly likely backwaiters and not waiters. Also, Restaurant Week is never, ever a fair indicator of a restaurant's quality. Give this place a chance; you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I am not new to fine dining. It's not an every day thing for me but at least a once a month thing for me. The service was spectacular but the food left more to desire. I get it, American's eat way more than they should and most portion sizes are out of control but when I spend $50 on my meal (over $200 for the entire table of 4) I expect to leave full. I did not leave full and that is unfortunate. Even the a la carte sides, that I was told were shareable, were barley enough for one person! What I got tasted good but there are much better options in Madison and the surrounding area that provide the same ambiance, service, quality of food and you can leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while, so I took some out of town guests here for a nice dinner.  While there were a couple of good things about the meal (the amuse-bouche and the scallop appetizer were great) there were so many more bad things-- I was really embarrassed that I brought my guests here.  The service was lacking, they were out of over half of their wines on the menu, and a lot of the food was poorly seasoned or cooked so badly that I had to send it back (which I never do).  They gave us free desserts for all the trouble, and our server seemed nice and he was trying hard, but it didn't make up for for the terrible meal.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to eat in Madison. It sits right across from the capitol.   The service here is phenomenal. It's probably the best service you'll get outside of Chicago, in these parts.  The food was great. It's not a 5-star menu, but it was all very good. We had the wurst platter, the gnocchi, the beat salad, and the New York strip, The steak was fantastic. The cocktails were done quite well. I had a drink I hadn't heard of before, and it was perfect before the meal.  It's on the pricey side for sure, but for a nice time out, I do recommend it."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Madison. Everything was well prepared, the stuff was very attentive(special thanks to Robbie). All dishes were executed very well. We had scallops, trout, chicken and mackeral. The pot de creme dessert was one of the best I've ever had, the amount of sweetness and spice was balanced very well.  The only down side is that the host didn't get a special request with our reservation. Not a big deal though."}
{"text":"I went to Harvest for a business dinner with a colleague and two of our suppliers a few weeks ago.  The concept of Harvest is a familiar one in Madison with a focus on local suppliers and the relationship with the farmers.  The owner used to be the chef de cuisine at E'toille and brings a nice level of class to the small restaurant.    When my colleague and I were first seated I began to peruse the wine list while we waited for our dinner companions and was pleased to see a good selection of European wines as well as some of my favorites from the Napa Valley.    Harvest's menu is set up as a short-ish list of small plates they suggest you might share with the table and a short-ish list of large plates intended as entrees.  I ordered the lamb carpaccio which was a small plate and the scallops that is also a small plate but they were offering that evening as a large plate option as well with just more scallops on the plate.    The carpaccio was served with a salty basil pesto and olive oil and was very tasty, though the ratio of lamb to pesto was a little off (too much pesto).  The scallops were divine, served with perfectly sweet cantaloupe and a cream sauce.  Decadent and melt in your mouth.    For dessert (because when your company is paying, you always get dessert) I had a lemon shortcake with chantilly cream.  It was pretty tasty though all of my dinner companions ordered the chocolate ganache and I had a little bit of chocolate envy.  Overall the food was good, well prepared, the ambiance was nice and the service was good.  My biggest issue (if you want to call it that) was the price/value.  Everything about Harvest gives you the impression that it's a super nice, upscale restaurant.  Including the $70 a person pricetag when you include wine and dessert.  But I don't think that the food was really worth the price.  Sure, it was tasty and well made, there was nothing wrong with it.  However, it lacked finesse.  It lacked the WOW factor that makes you feel like it's really worth it to be spending your money.  I love scallops and a good cream sauce and mine were tasty, but I could have easily made that at home for a third of the cost.  And the other two thirds wasn't made up for in the rest of the experience.   I would be happy to go to Harvest again and would enjoy myself, but only if someone else is picking up the bill."}
{"text":"I was planning a special dinner for some very important clients. This restaurant was highly rated not only on Yelp but also written up with high marks.The food was very good, and the wine list was also impressive with very reasonable prices. I've had better, but I still would've rated this restaurant much higher if not for the completely unacceptable service (or lack thereof) we received.  This place takes itself way too seriously. I know they're trying to come off as upscale, but rude doesn't equal upscale. One of my coworkers has very special dietary needs that require her to bring her own food, sealed in a package. This is never a problem for any restaurant where she goes except for this one. They were completely unaccommodating. Many of us placed our phones discreetly on the table, and at one point when my phone so gently chimed indicating a text message, I was promptly asked to silence it (even though each party on either side of me didn't even hear it).  This attitude, on top of the fact that we could never find a waiter to bring us another pricey bottle of wine when we needed it, just doesn't fly with me. My clients all were appalled at this behavior, and I felt like a loser for making a bad choice. We all wished we had gone to the much more lowbrow and less pretentious \"Old Fashioned\" next door. Next time, save your money and do the same."}
{"text":"Not sure if this place is worth the hype that surrounded it.  While in Madison this week- I had a chance to experience what everyone told me was the \"best restaurant in the city\".  In my opinion- it was good, not great and the service needs work.  Harvest has a great location right across from the Capitol within walking distance of the downtown hotels.  It's store front simplicity must surprise a lot of people as the night we were there- there were no less than 5 tables that got seated, looked at the menu, apologized and then walked out.    It's my belief that the name \"Harvest\" makes people think its some type of an organic sandwich shop when instead it is a white table cloth dining experience with a menu that includes a 6 course \"tasting\" paired with wines or a more traditional menu.  The food is good.  The chef sent out a \"muse\" of lettuce soup.  Yep- I said lettuce and that is what is tasted like.  Wasn't crazy about it, but half the fun of eating out is trying new things.  We ordered a variety of first courses from the tuna tartar (very good) to the duck prosciutto (good) to the Caesar wrap (not so good, yet it was the server's recommendation- very strange)  The Caesar wrap was like  small bits of rolled pastry around lettuce served with an anchovy on top and some sauce.  Not the best thing on the menu.  The main courses were very good.  We had the halibut, the hamachi (covered in foam and served with fava beans) and the crawfish lasagna made with spinach noodles.  For dessert we split the berry crumble (very sour) but good.  As for the service- it was nonexistent.  In fact- I might suggest that our server get a new career for herself.  She was unpersonable, didn't know the menu and seemed to always be a beat off.  We got more help from the busgirl who seemed very eager to help us out.  Very strange for a restaurant of that caliber.  Reasonably priced (at least by Chicago standards) the 6 course tasting menu was only $55 and the accompanying wines were another $25.  On the regular menu, the average entree was about $25.  So, bottom line?  It was good food, served in a very nice downtown location.  As for the service- if they get that right- I might give it another star."}
{"text":"I wish I could use half stars for Harvest. If I could, I would give them a 4.5 out of 5 instead. We had such a good experience there last Saturday. Our waitress was absolutely fantastic! I wish I could remember her name for this review. She was around 30, with long dark hair. She was so great!   For drinks, my boyfriend started with a gin cocktail that caught his eye and I had a half bottle of cab sav. They have a great drink selection.  For starters we shared the scallops, risotto and mushrooms. All, out of this world good! I would recommend each of these dishes.  For entrees, we were feeling torn and adventurous! My boyfriend was stuck between the pork and steak. I was torn between the fish and pasta. We told our waitress to surprise us both. She politely requested how we like our meat, so she could cook it to our taste depending on what she picked. I ended up with the  fish, it was so savory! Memorable meal for sure! My boyfriend enjoyed his steak, but it was rare beyond his taste even though that is how he requested it to the waitress. She agreed that it was overly rare and offered to put it back on the grill for him but he would rather eat it the way it was than risk it getting overdone. That is why we knocked off a star for this review.   I would 100% come back to Harvest without hesitation. This was a truly enjoyable and memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"We've been to Harvest twice during Restaurant Week (Winter 2010 and Summer 2010) and once or twice for their regular menus. We've had some spectacular meals there but I must say that something was off on our most recent visit (which was Restaurant Week - Summer 2010). The service was distracted and the food was fine - but all in all all - not that impressive. I had the Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho (best part of the meal), Braised Beef Shortribs (good but not amazing) and the Chocolate Cake (an utter disappointment - so dry I didn't finish it and that NEVER happens with me and dessert).  We'll be back to give it another shot, but I must say - we left disappointed with the last visit."}
{"text":"Someone else paid, so I shouldn't complain...but I won't let that stop me.   Harvest is one of those places with tiny silly portions that comes on a plate squiggled with butternut-rosemary-goat teat-pear seed reduction. Perhaps I am a complete plebeian Midwesterner, but after 3 courses, I left not full  and unimpressed with the food.  The food was interesting. It was complex. It was intellectual. It was edgy. It was NOT yummy. From appetizer to main course to dessert, there is nothing I tasted that I would ever care to have again. It's sort of like if you're dating some pretentious film student who makes you sit through all these gems of Swedish cinema, and you're thinking, \"People do not watch these movies unless other people tell them they should because they are without emotional power.\" The food at Harvest is like that, very heady without senorsy attraction. Would other people covet it so if it wasn't so widely coveted?   The service was very great. The meal was well paced, and we were able to have a long, relaxed conversation. I realize that this is one reason that people go to really expensive restaurants -- it would be nice if the food were an attraction too."}
{"text":"Sorry, but after coming here 2 times, I still don't quite \"get it.\" I think this is a place that coasts on its \"one of the best restaurants in Madison\" reputation. I had a weird-tasting ginger soup, scallops (delicious), and a steak. There was nothing really bad about it, but nothing that made my head explode with euphoria, either. They also do that fine-dining thing where you have a high price-to-potions ratio. The meal-sized version of the scallops, for example, is just a doubling of the appetizer portion, small to begin with.  Look, it's not bad food, but if you want fine dining, there are better places to go for better prices."}
{"text":"Family members and I dined on 08/26/16, party of 4; all courses were good including dessert and the service was good.  Wine selection had to be modified after it was discovered that our first selection was out of stock, but not a problem.  Dinner choices had to be modified after the first choice for 2 of the 4 diners was not available,  but not a problem.,  At the end of the meal  my generous brother and sister in law picked up the check, paid the bill and we departed.  As we waited outside the restaurant for our Uber, a member of the restaurant staff (not our server) came outside and accosted us, questioning whether there was a problem with the meal  because the amount of money left for the gratuity seemed small.  My brother returned inside to the restaurant  with the staff member and they discussed.  He ultimately added more money to the gratuity to appease the situation and to end the interaction with the aggressive Harvest staff member.  So here's the rub - the gratuity that was originally left was nearly 19% of the bill (excluding the tax)!  This outrageous action on the part of the restaurant has left a lasting, very unfavorable impression, no question.  It really marred what was a fantastic evening with good food and family.  I have dined at Harvest multiple times in the past and it has been consistently good but never have I experienced anything like this - the restaurant should be embarrassed!  We've contacted the restaurant owner, who is highly regarded in the Madison restaurant scene, and made her aware of what happened.  I doubt highly that I or my other family members will ever return to the restaurant - we were gobsmacked by the behavior of the restaurant staff member.  Heads up!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here for a once-a-month reservations-only dinner.  It was a 6-course meal featuring garlic.  Each course had a tasty wine pairing.  I liked all the wines to one degree or another, but I liked the sweet white the most (I don't remember what it was called).   Here is what we ate that evening:  Garlic Croquettas These were fried, garlicy and gooeyh, and very very tasty. This was my favorite part of the meal.  Sformato of Garlic, Herb Salad and Garlic Chips This was a custard kind of like flan, with roasted garlic. The garlic chips were thinly sliced garlic fried up. I didn't even realize they were just garlic; I had thought they were garlic-flavored potato chips. They were really good.  Sopa De Ajo, Chorizo and Poached Egg This was an interesting soup with meat and egg in it. It was really garlicy, and it was fun breaking up the poached egg and mixing it in.  Ravioli of Garlic and Potato, Braised Spring Onions I didn't taste the garlic as much in the ravioli, but it was still tasty. The spring onions were really good.  Braised Grouper, Garlic Broth, Aioli The grouper and aioli were really good.  The aioli (made from garlic and olive oil) was hand-ground with a mortar and pestle. It was very tasty.  Frutti di Bosci, Garlic Pastry Creme This was a garlic shortbread with fruit and custard-like sauce. The garlic wasn't very strong at all, and it was a tasty dish. It also had lavender buds on it, which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"I read recently that restaurants don't try too hard on Valentine's Day because they expect that their patrons are out for one nice meal and won't be repeat or regular customers. I had my doubts about that assumption until we went to Harvest last night. I can definitely say they lived up to the stereotype and that my husband and I will as well by not being repeat or regular customers. That being said, Harvest did some things well but bungled too many things for us to take another chance on this pricey restaurant.   We had an 8:30 reservation, showed up on time and waited about 20 minutes to be seated, along with a half a dozen other couples. I get that you're busy on Valentine's Day and that people take their time with their meals, but Harvest is not new to the game and should know better than to overbook their reservations. Also, there was nowhere to stand and wait except in the doorway or in the middle of a \"nice little seating area\" as the hostess said, which turned out to be in front of another doorway. Also, the hostess was rude and condescending to me when I tried to check in and pointed out that we had been standing there for a few minutes without being acknowledged. I'd been standing on my feet serving the public all day too lady - no need to have an attitude.   When we finally got seated, our waitress was very nice and attentive for how busy the restaurant was. I loved my Elderflower sidecar and my husband enjoyed his house martini. My first course scallops were amazing and came served in a very good sauce. I thought my husband's tuna confit was strange and didn't take another bite of it, but he enjoyed it.   Main course - I ordered the hanger steak which came with a side of potatoes with leeks. The hanger steak was okay, but overall the entire dish was pretty mushy. It's definitely not something I'm salivating over thinking about it the next day. It wasn't super flavorful or memorable, there wasn't much seasoning and really nothing that I can say makes me want to try it again. To sum it up in one word: meh. Which is a shame because I had an excellent hangar steak at Eno Vino not too long ago, which is what inspired me to try it at Harvest.   My husband had the NY strip steak, which I thought was very chewy. Again, not a memorable dish but he seemed to enjoy it.   We ordered one dessert to split between the two of us and tried the chevre cheesecake. The cake itself was good but the fruity stuff they put on top was so bad I couldn't take another bite. It was so horribly tart.   Husband and I both agreed the scallops were the highlight of the meal, which is sad because I've had amazing scallops elsewhere. So I can't see returning for just that.   The piece de resistance was when we were waiting to pay the bill. We were seated near the door, so we got an eyeful when a Jimmy John's delivery guy came in with a huge sandwich order for the staff. He was quickly ushered back into the kitchen to unload his delivery, but not before it was made pretty obvious what was going on. Harvest, don't you have a back door somewhere? For what I thought was supposed to be an upscale place (for which the price accurately reflected but not much else did) , that was pretty much the tackiest thing I've ever seen. Seriously?   I was pretty disappointed about the whole experience, not just because it was Valentine's Day but because my husband and I live in the neighborhood and have walked by Harvest hundreds of times, promising ourselves we needed to try it. I can tell you the anticipation was much better than the meal itself, and unfortunately we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was my only experience at Harvest.  I was excited because of full flavors from locally raised farm to table experience I've heard so much about.  They did not deliver.  It was restaurant week so the menu was limited, but included 3 courses.  To start I order the Waldorf Salad my wife got the mixed greens.  Her salad was great and fresh.  She really liked it.  I found the dressing a bit heavy on the mayo.  My Waldorf was just a pile of sliced apples covered in apple cider vinaigrette, plus a (1) halved grape and some celery.  For the entree I ordered the pork shoulder.  The was dried, shredded pork shoulder packed into a square and broiled.  The pineapple lime sauce was very acidic, heavy on the lime light on the actual flavor.  Very salty.   The server asked how the first bites were I said I wasn't too sure.  She said ok and walked away.  I took a few more bites and sent it back.  I got the chicken.  It was ok the gravy was a bit bland, the chicken was a bit bland, the exterior was crispy.  The biscuit would have been great if it was fresh.  The biscuit tasted a bit day old.  The star was the chocolate cup cake.  I guess it's fancy to put the frosting spread out on the plate rather than the cupcake, other that it was good.  It wasn't great, but it was the highlight.  I guess it's just not for me."}
{"text":"Loved the food at this place. Highly recommended.  When in madison you've got to go. Period."}
{"text":"Our first stop for Restaurant Week. Overall I like this place and will return. The ambience is nice. I especially like the lamps in the restaurant. Settings were closer inside than outside. If the weather is cool, sit outside.   First course was heirloom tomatoes gazpacho for me and white bean salad for my dining partner. I love the gazpacho. It was prepared with puréed heirloom tomatoes and small pieces of cucumber, dill, quartered tomatoes and goat cheese. Slides down very nicely. Tasty too. The white beans in her salad were delicious too.   2nd course was on the bland side. My tenderloin was too dry for medium. Ask for medium rare. Simply prepared with salt and pepper. Still enjoyable. My partner has the chicken and she said it was dry. I took a bite and it was alright. I have taster dryer chicken.   Dessert would be my favorite part of the meal. I had the lemon meringue custard and it was really good. My dining partner had the melon sorbet and that is fantastic! I love the bubbles on the side of the sorbet. Each gel bubble explodes in your mouth to give you a fresh melon taste. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week, and went into it with pretty high expectations.   Very unassuming from the outside, Harvest is a surprisingly expansive restaurant with a main section right when you walk in, and a lower, bigger section to the left. The dim lighting gives this place more of an intimate ambiance, making it a great date spot.  Also, a quick tip if you're intimidated by all the utensils: always work from the outside in, meaning, use the outer forks/spoons (first course utensils) before the inner ones (main course utensils).  Ok, now on to the good part, the food. For my three courses, I got the crispy cauliflower and brussel sprouts salad, the braised beef short ribs and the house-made chocolate stout gelato.   The salad was a great first course, as it was light and refreshing. The cauliflower and brussel sprouts had a slightly burnt taste, which complemented well with the semi-sweet dressing. The bits of bacon also added another dimension to the salad, by giving it a more cured taste.   The entree of braised beef was absolutely out of this world. The beef was cooked to perfection, and was soft and tender enough to be cut with your fork. The potato purée was smooth and silky, fitting in with the tender theme. The only grief I had was that I wish there was more of the delicious sauce, but we can't have everything.   And last but not least, the gelato closed out the meal. The chocolate stout gelato was just creamy enough, without being overwhelmingly rich, that kept the dish light and easy to eat.   Seeing as how all of my friends were satisfied with their meals, I'd say this night was a smashing success. There was also just enough food for us to be full, but not to the point of wanting to pass out due to food coma.   So far, I'd say this was the best meal I've had in Madison yet!   Came here for restaurant week, went into it with pretty high expectations, walked away with surpassed expectations."}
{"text":"Very Good Food.  Great Service.  Fantastic Drink Menu.  Chef even sends complimentary samples of potential new entrants to the menu.  You can taste the care put into each dish.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Once I had arrived for my reservation, this being the first time, my g/f and I had to wait over 5 minutes to even be acknowledged.  Once our coats were taken, they seated us and we ordered some drinks.  I had a sidecar and my g/f ordered a cherry drop.  Both cocktails were good and my hopes had been raised that the food would surpass the caliber of the drinks.  Basically the first course was partially cooked, the soup was bland and tasted canned, the entree was bland and tough, and the desert was the same recipe I had just eaten at a local pub.  I'm mostly disturbed because of all the money it had taken to receive such an outcome and will never go back unless offered an incentive to give them a second chance.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"This is simply the best restaurant in Madison.    Although they have a new chef.  They are still great!  (to be honest Justin the old head chef was better) The special event dinners are the best way to introduce you to this place.  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"So, I'm now 0 for 2 as far as \"fine dining\" is concerned in Madison.  Im starting to suspect that Madisonians are so desperate for something that is not Taco Bell that they think see great food when it is actually just mediocre. When my better half and I went here, the food was remarkably inconsistent. She enjoyed her scallops and mako, and the wine list was fine. I, on the other hand, had two unbelievably uninteresting plates. The duck confit first course was under seasoned and underwhelming. My main, the rabbit with tagliatelle, could have been good if the pasta had been properly cooked OR if they had seasoned anything. Sadly, I ended up only eating about a third and leaving the rest--it simply wasn't worth finishing. Oddly enough, the side of greens we ordered was the only thing that was seasoned, and that was SO over salted that we had to send it back.  They get three stars only because the service was solid and my better half liked most of what she had. If it were just me, I'd have gone with two stars."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I'm not a regular fine diner. The prices to what I normally expect to pay caught me a little off guard. But I did see the $$$ on this location, so I can't be too surprised. Once my group committed to the idea of treating ourselves and doing a real 'adult' meal, we really embraced the experience we were going to have.  Now, our waitress, she was a pro. I think she could tell that we may have felt a little out of our element and was able to help us pick a great wine. It may have been one of the best wines I had ever had. It was so smooth! If memory serves correctly, it was a Cabernet Sauvignon by Dusted Valley called Boomtown.  We were giving a teacup sized bowl of butternut squash soup (compliments of the chef). Now, I'm not sure if this 'compliments of the chef' was a surprise just for us, or if it happened to everyone that night. But that tasting was exquisite. It's funny though, one of my friends was skeptical at first, saying nothing was better than Panera's version. She quickly admitted how wrong she was.  For my first course, I enjoyed a salad of field greens. The cilantro vinaigrette was the highlight of the dish for the dressing. My main course was the roasted chicken breast. The chicken was on point. I'm not sure I've ever had bok choy before, a grilled cabbage, but it complimented the dish well. It also has spicy cornbread, I could have probably done without that, but I can see how it paired well with the meal.  Our group was also very tempted by the dessert menu. Our waitress sold us on the rice pudding and for me, the housemade ice cream with cookie. It was the best vanilla ice cream with sugar cookie combo I will ever eat. Something so simple, who would have thought it would be so delicious.  We must have gotten there at the right time too, no reservations and we were able to get the table next to the window with a great view of the Capitol.  Our waitress really made the night for us. I can see why this location is held in such high regards. I just wish portion sizes were a little bigger. But I think fine dining seems to always limit portion sizes, making you have to come back because you want more. I almost forgot, I also ordered a shot of espresso. They served it with a little brown sugar cube."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Harvest tonight with colleagues - it was a wonderful relaxing evening.  Our waiter, Paul I think, was superb - attentive but not overbearing, informative and had a great sense of humor.    I like the simplicity of the interior - clean and minimal.  The menu was well presented but somewhat limited.  I will say that even with the limited number of items they have, there's something for everyone.   We were presented with a teeny \"shot\" of butternut squash soup to start, roasted beet and marinated squid salads with main courses of pumpkin squash, hanger steak and tenderloin - all good.  We finished with a cheese plate of local cheeses and cinnamon ice cream.   Bottom line, I'd go again.  Oh and you can't beat the location!"}
{"text":"AWFUL is being nice. group of 4, two of us got the cod with corn and bacon. too smoky and the bacon was chewy. the roasted chicken was dry and the bread salad was hard and more like giant croutons. the chicken of the woods mushrooms should be renamed cedar chips. to add insult to injury, the bill was $220 for 4 people for dinner and a couple beers each. small snobby menu. waste of a dinner out. the old fashioned next door is 10 million times better."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week.  The salad with green goddess dressing was amazing and the risotto was decent but the melon sorbet was terrible. I usually love sorbet and have had a lot of different kinds but not only was their flavor off, it had the texture of a freezer burned Italian ice more than a smooth sorbet. Not only that but i sent it back and didn't even get a discount or something to make up for it."}
{"text":"At these prices you would expect the food to be great. Well it was just okay....... that is just not right. The service was great, room was pleasant, and the view of the capitol building and the street traffic was fun. I had the Harvest Martini, which was the highlight of the dinner. My first dish was the grilled octopus, which was nice and had good flavor. The main course was the flank steak. The taste was good, but the meat was tough.  For desert was suppose to be a piece of apple cake; it was a muffin with little or no apples, not good at all. Of course the presentation was great; the servers were attentive and very personable.  But I will take a little less style for more substances."}
{"text":"The dining experience was unbelievable! I have never been spoken to so rudely...in fact our server said horrible things throughout the evening! I asked for a recommendation on the steaks and his response was, \"I don't know you and I have no idea what you'd want.\" Next, I asked for the steak to be prepared medium well. The server informed me that the chef \"doesn't cook the steak like that\". I couldn't believe his demeanor or his words! There was only one more couple dining there....that should have been my first clue to leave!!! Once the food came, I wasn't able to eat it. The flavors were strange! I did wonder if the food was safe to eat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for a weekend away and decided to give this place a try.  We had read about it's organic and locally farmed menu and were intrigued.  We both really love food and wine and so our expectations were high.  They were met and then some.  Our server was very informative, funny and not overbearing in the slightest.  She had little tid bits of knowledge about everything we were eating, coursed our meal out for us and split the items that we wanted to share.  Very professional and comfortable.  The food was outstanding.  The meal started with a little taste of a chilled asparagus soup, then a roasted beet, hazelnut and blue cheese salad.  We then had a fresh pasta course and finished the meal with some short ribs over polenta with a side of snap peas. The food is totally unpretentious and tastes like it is supposed to taste.  The beets tasted like beets, the asparagus soup like sweet delicious asparagus.  The ingredients are so quality that the chef is not tempted to force other flavors onto them.  The wine and beverage selection was great, though perhaps a little California happy.  At the end of the meal we were delighted to drink a German honey drink called barenjager.  Even more delighted to find out that Sam's carries it!  In short, I am a fan and will certainly make an excuse to travel to Madison just to eat here again."}
{"text":"A friend and I ate at Harvest for Restaurant Week. We chose it because it had some solid vegetarian options, and everything sounded really good!  This was my second time at Harvest, although the first was probably ten years ago (or at least it seems that long ago), but I do remember it being very good back then. Before I review the food, I must say, the service was impeccable. Our server was so incredibly friendly and helpful. I have had a rash of bad service the last few times I've been out and this was such a refreshing change.  I chose some kind of Lemon Drop drink made with Door County cherry juice. It was just the right level of sweet and sour. I'm not really a mixed drink kind of girl, but I felt like a beer wasn't quite appropriate in this instance! For my first course, I chose the butternut squash and cider soup. I love me some squash soup. Or pumpkin. Or really any kind of winter vegetable. The soup was good, but not amazing. It tasted very, very fresh...which seems like a good thing, but in some ways it could have used a bit more cream or seasoning or cider or something. There was also a giant hunk of solid squash in the middle of my soup. I'm not entirely sure if this was on purpose or not, but I have to assume that one would be aware of dumping that into the bowl. So, it was probably supposed to be there. I could have lived without that.   My main entree was potato gnocchi which was served with mushrooms and parmesan. I have mixed feelings about this dish. The gnocchi itself had an excellent texture, but was somewhat flavorless, as gnocchi tends to be.  The \"mushroom ragu\" wasn't a sauce at all and seemed mostly like a bunch of mushrooms and some kind of other watery sauce without much flavor.  I finally found that if I ate every bite of gnocchi with a chunk of mushroom, it was quite delicious, but to eat it plain was rather underwhelming. I think in the past the gnocchi I've had at other establishments has had such tasty sauce, that I was expecting the same here. This was my least favorite part of the meal.  Things really looked up at dessert time. I chose the espresso budino and my friend chose the crack pie. My budino (aka: pudding/custard) was maybe in the top five desserts I've ever had. It was SO good. And this is coming from the girl who doesn't drink coffee. It was thick and rich and tasty and I wanted to ask if perhaps I could pay extra to have another little dish of it. My friend's crack pie (served with cherries) was almost equally as good (though not quite). The waitress described it as being a bit like creme brûlée, but it was actually quite different. I don't really even know how to describe it other than to say it was delicious!   If I had to rate just the food on this recent trip to Harvest, I probably would only give a 3 or 3.5 star rating, however there are a few things that make it a solid 4 star experience. First, the service, as I previously mentioned. Both the hostess and our server were wonderful. Second, the $25 price point for the meal. Last year, I ate a $35 Restaurant Week meal at another restaurant and felt like I had been screwed. At Harvest, I felt like I was getting an excellent deal. AND, because the temperature were pretty frigid that day, they offered a $25 gift card with your meal. I assumed my friend would be the only one to receive a gift card, as she was the one who had gotten the email about it, however the server brought us both out gift cards. So, I paid $25 for a meal that was surely worth more, and I got a $25 gift card to come back and eat again...can't beat that."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by my most recent meal at Harvest. Though some of the dishes we had were particularly delicious (the scallops, for example), a series of slip ups made this somewhere I won't come back to.   Our entrees came out quickly after we ordered - so quickly, in fact, that we got them before our starters, which came at the end of the meal. The manager comped them accordingly, but they lose their appeal after a large main course rather than before.   The kitchen also didn't cook our entrees properly. Salmon ordered medium-rare was served overdone, and a (pricey) steak ordered medium-rare was served raw enough that it needed to be sent back. The new steak arrived unrested, and still not properly cooked.   The staff handled this situation appropriately (though were clearly embarrassed), but such an array of issues at a white linen restaurant on the square really wasn't acceptable - not somewhere worth returning when there are so many other options where basic food preparation and service are more consistent."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner. The first time for a regular dinner one year ago, the second time yesterday for a restaurant week dinner. I thought the first time I had a fairly solid meal and most of the options were quite tasty. I would award my first visit 3.5 stars. The second time was a disaster and I would give it a generous 2 stars. I will mostly focus on this last experience as it is more recent and carries more weight. For restaurant week, the place offered a menu with a choice an appetizer, main course, dessert. No regular menu. I'm ok with this. The waitress came to pick our order. We were fairly confident about our choices for appetizer and first course so we ordered those and said we would decide the dessert later. The waitress said, \"No we are taking your full order now\". We are \"Ok we'll pick these 2\". This wasn't great, but oh well. Let's get to the food. My wife got the (smoked?) salmon for the appetizer. It was bad. Chewy, fishy, poorly dressed, tiring. I got the turnip soup. Nothing amazing, but not bad. For the main course, my wife got the artichoke lemon risotto. Pretty bad, not even sure where the artichoke was. I got the lamb shoulder. Tiiiiiiiiiny portion, smaller than my appetizer. It was just some shaved dry meat on top of some (cold) polenta. Really bad. The two main courses were cheap-cafeteria-level. The dessert: the chocolate panna cotta wasn't bad, but the orange chiffon cake was dry, chewy, and tasteless.  Will I go back to Harvest? Hopefully no."}
{"text":"I wrote to management about my bad experience there, and it's been 3 weeks without a response. Below I've pasted the email I sent, and I hope this inspires them to both do better with the issue AND responding to customer complaints. We will not be back.  \"My husband and I chose your restaurant for our date night last night. It is not something we'd usually consider because of the price, but we wanted something special and we like your focus. I was led to believe that we would be well taken care of. It seemed like the whole staff knew of my gluten sensitivity. I felt confident that our server was checking with the chef despite not understanding what gluten was at all. I found out that instead, he submitted my order without checking at all. I had told him that I preferred the pheasant, and that the spaetzle could be replaced with anything gf and I would be happy. When the meal arrived as stated on the menu, I asked again and found out that he hadn't had a chance (in an hour!) to check if it was ok. It was whisked away, then he came back with a menu because the WHOLE MEAL was actually full of gluten. I quickly ordered the bass minus couscous since our 8pm show at the Bartell was quickly approaching. The salad provided so I didn't have to sit and watch my husband eat was a nice touch, but not enough to make up for the quickly cooked meal that arrived next. The fish seemed overdone, and the fava beans were hard. I ate it fast because I was hungry and in a hurry, not because it was so delicious I couldn't hold back. For over $100, I guess I expected better. I get that the fish was made under pressure, but the service that led to it was the real disappointment. I still tipped the server because I know that's his livelihood, but he didn't deserve it.  A solution for the future is to have a separate gluten free menu with a few choices on it so the servers don't have to guess and check.\""}
{"text":"Wonderful! Attentive and precise service.  Great menu for sharing.  Lovely atmosphere.  Even when there was a hiccup with a dish that wasn't great, the staff cheerfully replaced it.  The rest of the food was delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  There are not enough I can say about how great the food is at Harvest.  The veggie plate looked like art when it was served & was delicious.  It's a shame I don't live here because I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in for restaurant week.  We originally had a reservation for outside on the patio but it was about 90 degrees.  Staff was friendly and flexible and was able to seat us inside right away.  Food selections were original and fun, I ordered the cucumber salad and the heirloom tomato risotto with the banana coriander ice cream as a desert.  I also had a cherry drop cocktail.  All of the food and drink were very tasty.  The portion size felt a little small.  We loved our server she was funny, sweet and accommodating.  Another perk, sitting by the window on the square, great view!"}
{"text":"Stopped in late (8:45) but I had to come here!  Had the Arugala salad and roasted chicken breast. Delicious!  And the waitress suggested a great pairing of the Sauvignon Blanc. Set the meal off perfectly!"}
{"text":"Hey the food was good, but didn't live up to it's price. I felt that the host and server were detached and not friendly. It's just ok."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least. I went once, for Restaurant Week, and the food was bland and unremarkable, and servings were small. It seems to be very hit-or-miss from what I've heard. In my case, I don't see myself coming back, there's much better alternatives in Madison for the same price range."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an amazing view in Madison that is close to the Capitol and State Street, I would definitely recommend Harvest. However, if you are looking for an excellent meal, I would search a little further.   First of all, the service from our waiter was mediocre at best. He was slow to take our order, barely checked up on us, and was \"rude\" in my opinion with his mannerisms.  The food we ordered was again \"mediocre\". Presentation I would mark a 10, but taste I would mark a 6-7. My sister's salmon was not fully cooked. The patte we ordered was quite disgusting in my opinion (and yes, I have had good patte in the past). My chicken was quite good, with the exception of the lettuce becoming quickly soggy underneath it. Overall, for the prices we paid (and I don't mind paying a hefty price for a GOOD meal), were not worth the food we consumed.  If you're in Madison and looking for a restaurant with some great food, skip Harvest and look for something with a little more flavor, hip atmosphere, and better service."}
{"text":"God, what happened to this place?  Previous positive visits led me to try and book Harvest for a private dinner with friends. I contact the restaurant by phone--got a curt \"This is a bad time to talk!\" reply from the owner. \"No big deal,\" I thought to myself. \"It's Friday, it's probably busy.  Try again at a better time.\"  Dear readers, that better time never came.  Two emails and a phone call later, I finally managed to speak with someone. I booked the dinner and asked for a confirmation.  Nothing. Two weeks pass and I check in on said confirmation. Nothing. Another week passes and I decide to email to cancel.  Again, nothing.   I FINALLY get that missing confirmation a month after I've cancelled.  Seriously.  I can't think of a time where I've had worse customer service."}
{"text":"While the farm to table trend is one that my palate truly appreciates and admires , this savvy restaurant is one that I would have to rate mediocre at best .      The restaurant was I'll prepared for our 17h45 reservation time with it taking twenty minutes to receive our drinks, keeping in mind we were one of two tables . The amuse bouche, a garlic cream gazpacho was barely palitable, with a strong garlic sensation followed by a bitter creamy aftertaste . The first courses were decent, we had ordered the beet chevre salad which is hard to screw up and was delicius with golden and red beets perfectly preserved atop a bed of whipped chevre. We also ordered the beef tpngue, foie gras, and the tuna tar tar. All were delightful except the tar tar which was overly fishy indicative that the fish was too old .   The second course was generously proportioned especially for a gastronomic restaurant, with people in our party ordering everything from the chicken to the pork chop, gnocchi, mackerel, and two dofferbt cuts of steak. The main course in my opinion is where this restaurant failed to meet my expectations. Nothing was extraordinary, one of the meals was cold, my beef tenderloin was over cooked with the accompanying roasted brussel sprouts dripping in oil.   Finally, dessert which once again was not anything outstanding. The brown butter ice cream was no different than a store bought vanilla , the tropical carrot cake was a tasty treat but over powered by the vanilla sauce it was soggily swimming in . The dessert I had ordered, a chocolate maple tart was overly dense and rich with the maple accent lacking any sort of maple.    Overall, if you are new to this style of restaurant, I'm sure this would surpass your taste buds as the attempt was met, however ; if you frequent the farm to table gatronomiques I'm sure you will agree that although well attempted , the food overall falls short . It was a lovely meal as far as ambiance and company goes, but I would bot return for the food or service . In my personal opinion, try Heritage or pull out the big bucks for the unmatched experience of L'étoile."}
{"text":"Okay- so as far as regular restaurants go, this is probably a 4 star, but I want to hold Harvest to a higher standard.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I went during restaurant week... Also, I'm not saying its not a great place, it wasn't what I prefer.  The cocktails were very good - I will recommend those.  The ambiance was very boring and too stiff for my tastes. I felt out of place talking to my table of four.  The food was pretty good- I appreciate simple food, but they may take it a step too far. I thought my entree (short ribs) was too plain. You can definitely taste the quality - but I go to a really nice restaurant to taste things I couldn't imagine or things that are too difficult for regular people to easily prepare.   On a final note -the dessert was stunning: panna cotta"}
{"text":"Another of my top 5 Madison favorites.  I love the local food concept, the first time I ate here was for a frat formal when I was a dewy eyed freshman.  The $120 tab between my date and I cemented what I already knew - I need to make a LOT of money someday so I can eat at places like this regularly.  They have a crumb scraper....it's all about the small things.  Perfect sized protions and no need for a to-go box....don't you dare.  Don't skip dessert...the creme brulee is wonderful.  My next goal is to sign up for one of their fancy 7 course dinners with wine pairings.  5 big stars!!!"}
{"text":"I appreciate this place for what it attempts to be; locally sourced food with an emphasis on quality and inventive ingredients.  That being said, I too thought the menu was a little limited.  We were disappointed they were out of the morel mushrooms but understand given the sustainability... the salad with smoked trout was done well but lacked something to bring all the flavors together.  The handmade gnocchi was done perfectly and in a light sauce that was fresh and not too heavy.  My date had wonderfully handmade pasta with lamb sausage which was great and our server was top notch as he was very helpful in suggesting great wines for a variety of pallets.    We'll go back on a night when they offer small plates, which is only during M-F, the main reason we'll be back is because the service was fantastic and we'll hope for a few improvments in the food as these chefs continue to strive for excellence."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give them 5 stars, but both times i have been there the hostess gave off a seriously bad vibe.  What's funny though is that both servers were so nice and did a really great job.  Maybe this is their technique?    The food is very tasty.  I had the halibut and my fiance had the tenderloin.  The tenderloin was better, but for being in the middle of the country, the Halibut was pretty damn good also.  Both had terrific sauces that really made the dish.  Kudos to the chef.  I also had the steamed clams with chorizo as an appetizer.  That turned out to be a real winner.  The residual sauce at the bottom of the bowl was perfect for dipping.  We avoided dessert this time, but last time had the cheese plate.  The cheese's were all Wisconsin cheese's (big surprise)  and were all excellent.  I saw their desserts at another table, and while i was happy with the cheese plate, realized i would not have gone wrong getting the other instead (besides the massive calorie infusion).    The interior of the restaurant is pretty classy and comfortable, but on a nice night grab a seat outside with a view of the square.  That is the way to go.  Props also for the excellent wine selection.  They had a long list of Pi-not Noirs with many of them out of Oregon.  That means their sommelier knows his business."}
{"text":"I have been to Harvest twice now and both times I was very happy with my dinner.  Every time, I happily ate appetizer, main and dessert, plus the delicious amouse bouche. I was happy with every thing every time.  I also had pretty good wine all the time. And service was attentive and careful.  The weak point is probably the space. On the capitol square there are some pretty awesome places and Harvest just feels a tiny bit outdated."}
{"text":"Harvest is wonderful...actually one of my \"go to\" places in Madison for a night of enjoyable food.  Cannot go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Ok, this is one of those \"up town\" places with high prices and good food so I knew what I was getting into. My wife had the halibut and was very pleased with the way it was prepared and it's excellent taste. I on a whim had the bison ribeye. The steak was good but the thin sauce that it was swimming in sort of ruined it for me. At first it seemed to compliment the meat but as I ate it, it sort of overwhelmed  it. The potatoes that were also on the plate were soaked with the same sauce and were uneatable..It  sort of overpowered the plate. It did eat the steak and it good but not 42 dollars good. I think this is still a four star restaurant but not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Harvest was recommended to me by one of my closest friends but I wasn't sure because the reviews weren't as high as some other places on the square -- and I'm so glad I believed her instead of relying strictly on yelp! It was a perfect dinner experience and I'll definitely be returning. The service was perfect, the drink selection was wonderful, the food was outstanding. There wasn't a thing they needed to improve on. Thanks for a wonderful dinner experience!"}
{"text":"We went there for their 6 course lobster dinner with wine pairings and were very excited.  Unfortunately, only one out of the six dishes was inspired and it left us feeling like the $75 per person was not worth it.  The rest of the food was bland, average and at times not temped correctly.  The wine pairings were good and the pace of service was good.  I can't say I'm in a rush to get back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Amazingly wonderful tasting food from local ingredients. The staff is kind, attentive, and respectful. If you want a fabulous local food restaurant and don't mind spending a bit extra $$ for it, definitely eat here."}
{"text":"A very classy place with excellent food. The problem is that the portions are small and a bit pricey. But if you are like me and want to see how the other half lives I would recommend this place. The staff was very helpful and got me through the wine selection. Overall for two people, main dish only and a half bottle I dropped $100 plus a hefty tip. But my girlfriend loved it and thought it was a romantic date so I guess my goal was achieved."}
{"text":"Harvest is an excellent restaurant on the main square in downtown Madison. Their food incorporates local seasonal ingredients. I had a special salad of local heirloom tomatoes with a soft cheese (forgot the name), small leaves of basil and sea salt. Some of the best tomatoes I've had in years. I selected the home-made cavatelli pasta - made with pesto. sliced baby potatoes and green beans. Very good - and finished with a passion fruit sorbet. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not sure about the hype. Service was slow initially. Our reservation was immediately taken care of (+) but we waited 15 minutes before a server arrived and that was after I asked for assistance. Plenty of staff running around on a crowded Monday night but it was like we were invisible. However, after we were attended to things went uphill (+). Food was good, nice choices for restaurant week and it was filling. I've heard from others about the uneven service but I will give any place a try. I will have to think long about going back especially at these prices. I don't think it would take long to improve things. The crowds keep coming so there is hope."}
{"text":"Disappointing.   Maybe it was because we were there for Restaurant Week, but the options were all overly simple (could have made all of it in under half an hour no problem) ,small, and somewhat bland. Not what I expected from an upscale place.  First, our salad was just greens pretty much, and my boyfriend's shepards pie was small and tasteless.  My chicken was tender and well-cooked, but it was supposed to come with Mushroom sauce, of which I spotted about two drops.  Both of our deserts (apple crisp and chocolate almond cake) would have been better warmed up and mine had a weird after-taste of cherry cough-syrup.  The portions were extremely small too.  I can usually eat about half of a Wisconsin-sized dinner entree and here I ate the whole thing and was still hungry.  I know it's supposed to be a good deal, (for restaurant week), but not if they're portions are for babies.  The pluses include romantic ambiance and good service (my water was never empty - an undervalued part of a good dining experience).  Also - the chicken...so tender (but still so plain!).   But, I don't think I'm coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"We stopped in without reservations, were warmly welcomed by Gwen, and had impeccable service from Max.  Everything was perfect.  The salad of field greens and the parsnip soup were excellent first courses.  I had the salmon (always good) and my husband, the beef tenderloin.  That steak was as good, or even better, than any of the noted steakhouses in Madison.  Max and Gwen helped us decide which wine to select (and they do have an impressive wine list).  This is one of the BEST restaurants in Madison.  Great food, great atmosphere.  You can actually sit at your tablecloth-covered table, with a candle on it, and have a conversation with your partner without yelling, like one has to do in so many restaurants.  It is not cheap, but it won't break the bank, either.  A very classy place!"}
{"text":"We really like Harvest.  Obviously, fresh local ingredients make this restaurant what it is.  My fiancée always enjoys the gnocchi or ravioli that is usually on the menu.  I always am torn between scallops or fish but I've had steak in the past that was great also.  I've been there too many times to focus on specific dishes.  Cocktails are great. Bees Knees comes with a little chunk of honeycomb. I like the beer list and appreciate them priced at $4, $4.50, $5 typically.  Overall, I like this restaurant for the food and the convenience of it rarely being full. Reservations a couple hours in advance are usually available even on weekends. Go try it."}
{"text":"The bronzini was really good. My wife liked the lamb.  Nice portions and good flavors. The charcuterie starter was very good. Great location too."}
{"text":"Harvest was awesome! My Mother, Father, Husband, Myself, and our 7mo old daughter came in for a early Friday dinner. I was a little nervous coming in with the baby, but the hostess was so warm and inviting. She sat us at a table where I could pull up the stroller and checked on us later. The staff was so nice and knowledgeable! We are foodies so we got a bunch of apps and entrees and shared everything. The server coursed it out for us. The food was great! We did wine by the glass and paired with courses. It was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Full Disclosure - this meal here was part of a learning seminar I was at for my travel business.  We had a choice of some basic options.  I had a salad, chicken dinner, and lemon meringue type dessert.  The salad was basic.  The chicken tasted good, but was also somewhat pink, and people at our table thought possibly undercooked.  I ate most of mine.  The veggies were good.  The dessert was the highlight, with some good flavors and textures coming through.  I don't know if I would try this place again, as the prices are a little on the higher end.  But it served its purpose for the class we were in."}
{"text":"I went here (a few years ago) for one of their prix fixe dinners.  It was a Louis Latour wine pairing & seafood dinner for something like $65 per person before taxes or gratuities.    As it turned out, there were 6 'courses,' all paired with a different wine.  The chef and someone from the winery had gotten together to do the pairings, and the result was truly superb.  I've had wines \"go well\" with dinner before, but this was downright magical.  Between me and my dining companion, the food got 5 stars.  I couldn't stomach all of it--for instance, the raw Kumamoto Oyster w/tomato 'gelee.'  My date raved on and on about how fresh and wonderful it was, and even went so far as to compliment the chef.  I, on the other hand, almost vomited.  Raw oysters are like big wads of phlegm.  Blech!  But, I powered through (in the interest of not spitting out my food in front of strangers) and made it on to bigger and better things.  Memorably, they had a seafood 'patty' with spaetzle (jiggly and unattractive, but delectable), a terrific striped bass, and a mind-bogglingly amazing lobster.    My problem with Harvest that evening was the tables were arranged such that you had to sit with strangers.  On our right were two snobs trying to out-impress each other with their blase attitudes about how rich and important they are.  I would've had a MUCH better experience if I wasn't forced to sit next to those two.  I don't know if it's always like this or if it was just for the special prix fixe dinner--hopefully not!"}
{"text":"Harvest was super chill. Unknowingly, we walked in very near to close of business. They were so very welcoming, despite. They kindly provided recommendations for food, places in the area to check out after dinner*, and executed our off-menu drinks with ease. Meanwhile, not only did they bring us bread to snack on before our food arrived, but they also brought out a sample of a green, leafy, herb-y thing, just because!   In all, the service and food were great! Try the frites- everyone raves about them, and I can attest that they were awesome!  *literally everyone on staff at that time came out to give their two cents. It was so cute and cool! haha"}
{"text":"We made a reservation and took advantage of the lack of kids in town with Spring Break. It has been on our todo list of places to visit and taste. We sampled a few things:  1. Mussel starter - okay 2. Shrimp Bisque starter - okay 3. Linguini - specialty? Esh... 4. Cheese Platter - nice to see a cheese platter on the menu. tasty.  Nothing was out of this world. Service was excellent, but the food was just okay. We very much wanted to like the place as it is very much our palette, but it was just not worth it for the cost."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night and uniformly disappointed.  My husband had the Brussel sprouts salad and he said it had zero flavor.  He loves all Brussel sprout dishes and was completely disappointed.  I had the seared artichoke and there was one or two pieces of artichoke in the salad.  It was such a let-down!  My husband had the risotto appetizer for an entree and he said the risotto was pretty good but really tiny.    We went here expecting fine dining and were completely disappointed by the taste and the portions.  We moved to Madison from SF and these would have been disappointing by SF standards.  We do not recommend Harvest."}
{"text":"Chose this place as a pre-pre race dinner choice. It was low key, more upscale and quiet. No reservation was necessary. I really wanted pasta (something warm, comforting and filling). During the time we were there they only had one pasta dish, the Linguini.  You could tell it was homemade by the littler imperfections and a slight toughness. It was a nice sized dish. I was full but if you walk in starving you will want to order something additional. My fiancé ordered the Trout.  It was alright, cooked pretty well/charred. I enjoyed the sweet corn emulsion that came with it (think creamed corn flavor). We also made a last minute decision to add a side of seasonal roasted mushrooms. They had two varieties that evening the Hen of the Woods and Oyster. We were told they can only do one kind but the chef obliged and they gave us a mix. Better idea because I think I would have been sick of eating a whole bowl of just one or the other. They were good enough to eat alone or you could add them to your dish. Overall they are in a great location, it is quiet and older crowed. Not so much the normal WI bar scene.  It looks up scale but could be laid back. I think they are trying too hard. I'm not sure I would go back, maybe once they change their menu over to try some new things."}
{"text":"Cheerio!  Good friends!  I went here last night dressed in my finest.  I was chauffeured in my stretch Hummer limo.  I was accompanied by my lovely wife, she is 90% plastic, 10% human, just as the good Lord intended.  The good Lord, being me.  As I entered the establishment I saw many people that were clearly beneath me.  I was taken aback by the amount of liberals that littered the place!  I had to wipe my furrowed brow with my 2000 silk thread count kerchief when I realized how boring, bland, and tasteless the clientele here were.  I promptly informed my wife that if she were to keep such friends as these tasteless liberals I would have to beat her more than I already do, and that, my friends, would be quite the tragedy.    Being the daring sort that I am, I agreed to be seated.  I found the wine list to be quite good, however, the food was, as the other brilliant, sophisticated, reviewer \"Boyd\" had mentioned, just too boring and tasteless, coincidentally, just like the insulting, low brow liberals that littered the place.    When I got back to my mansion, I forced my wife to write a strongly worded letter to the management, and then I made dinner arrangements for the following weekend with my finest, richest, nobly conservative friends, the Koch brothers.    Sincerely,  A gigantic, judgmental, yet well-groomed prick"}
{"text":"First time there and will be going back for sure!! It was a perfect night! Food was amazing. We sat on the patio overlooking the capital. The service was great. I had steak and my wife had halibus and it was delicious.  We also had cauliflower soup - and I about licked the bowl. It was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite.. but atrocious customer service has me steamed..  So I made reservations for a party of 4.. 4 weeks out. no problem.. all confirmed, I actually went back to opentable a few days later and adjust the time slightly, but still no problem.. got confirmation email.. all was grand in the world. Was to be a nice night.. taking my staff out for a meal. Night before, I went online to add a person, make it a 5 top, the more the merrier. Opentable said I needed to call, no problem, I called. Phone was answered by a extraordinarily unhelpful, borderline rude woman who said \"how can you have a reservation? we are closed for a special molecular dinner, and you aren't on that list.\" Me- \"um what? I have a confirmation right here\" Her- \"Yeah you should have been called, you can't come unless you want our (Stupid hipster nonsense molecular) special menu. You're going to have to go somewhere else\" Me- \"um no I don't want your stupid hipster meal, I just want to go to a favorite restaurant of mine\" Her- \"nope, go somewhere else\"  So I'm upset. No one called me at all.. and had I not wanted to add a person to my table, I would have turned up and been turned away, embarrassing me and my party.  I had to go to a less desirable place (true story, it turned out to be better than Harvest anyway, so I guess I win)   Here's the real punchline, the next day I receive an email from the proprietor telling me that I was notified.. and I must have just ignored it. Well.. the thing is I wasn't. She also said they hate using Opentable, because problems happen. WELL THAN DON'T HAVE IT AS AN OPTION!!!  Since I didn't like being called a liar, I pulled the phone record for the phone number she said she called.. Oddly enough, no call from them.. at all.. anywhere. Huh.. Who would have guessed it!   Short story long.. this place didn't handle my reservation properly. they called me liar, which I wasn't. When I emailed them the phone records to show they did not in fact call me.. oddly enough, I never heard from them again.  There are excellent dining options in Madison.. choose one that treats you properly.. this ain't one of them that does that.  (left 2 stars, because the food was fantastic the other times I've been there.. will never be back because of service and that makes me sad, cuz they cook a mighty nice meal)"}
{"text":"It's suddenly and quite very official. I'm a BIG FAN of Harvest!!! In all my many years living in Madison, I have never gotten there and suddenly I've been twice in the last 3 weeks for 2 different events (a birthday celebration & restaurant week) and boy howdy am I a \"cuisinely\" blessed individual.  Side note: sometimes I make up fun words like \"cuisinely\". You're welcome.  The entire staff is fabulous! No kidding, no matter who you deal with - Jen or Nancie or Alyssa or.... Fabulous! And the ambiance is lovely, not overly loud or harshly lit. Also fabulous!  For the birthday celebration, I enjoyed the grilled steak special of the day (a hangar steak) with pan roasted Yukon potatoes, chimichurri, and pickled shallots. I ordered it as the chef recommended (medium rare) and it was, to date, one of the most flavorful, tender steaks of my life. It was easily one of my top 3 steaks of all time. The chimichurri was perfect (it made me miss Restaurant Magnus - chimichurri heaven). And who knew pickled shallots were a thing let alone a really, really good thing. I have been schooled!  And last night, for Restaurant Week, I experienced yet another incredible meal. I ordered the crispy confit chicken thigh with coleslaw to start, the pan roasted trout for my entrée, and the mojito sorbet to finish. The chicken thigh was perfectly crispy & salty & rich with a nice balance provided by the vinegar-kissed creaminess of the slaw. The Lake Superior trout was totally insane. I literally couldn't eat it slowly enough, wishing the entire time that it would never end. Yes, it was that good.  It wasn't at all fishy, the skin was crispy, and the fish itself was tender and flavorful. It basked gloriously in this divine, sweet corn emulsion with a green bean and zucchini succotash - light and creamy and not overly sweet. I would have licked the plate if I hadn't been worried about making a scene. I. Want. More!  And then the mojito sorbet..... You guys! It was, quite frankly, the best sorbet I have ever had. Seriously. It was so amazing that it was totally not okay and I'm pretty sure I'm now completely ruined where all other sorbets are concerned. I'm not even sure how to describe all the flavors and elements that it celebrates. You just have to order it and try it and then you'll know. And for the record, I don't even like mojitos and I loved this dessert. I literally have no complaints. My only sadness is that I was so into my meal that I totally forgot to take photos.  So there it is, my dear Yelp friends. Hurry. Go now. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Maybe because it's organic? Bland. Though the atmosphere is calming and inviting for a leisurely dinner the food missed it's mark. That's why I gave it 2 stars. I had the diced fresh beets I can't even remember what was in it.  Forgettable I guess. I had to ask for salt to bring out the flavor. They don't like to use salt in their cooking and we had to ask for it since it was not on the table. I do not use a lot of salt but the appetizer and our entree needed it. I order the bass which was ok but I thought maybe slightly undercooked. It came with fingerling potatoes and some spinach that was bland. My friend had fresh pasta cavatelle in a light pesto sauce. The pasta was too chewy and it had a texture more like eating squid. Though pesto is basil based it was too strong. Maybe a bit more roasted ground pine nuts would help offset the strong basil flavor. She did have a side of mushrooms which was very good. The service was good to but maybe a bit too conscientious. Better that then none at all."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for Harvest it appears I am not the only one who found the Hostess to be unabashedly nasty.  My guests and I arrived at 7:35 for an 8:00pm reservation fully intending on ordering drinks at the bar since we were so early.  When I told her we had arrived early for our reservation and would be happy waiting at the bar she shot us a nasty glare and said \"geesh, you are a half hour early, I can't seat you\" Um, that's ok honey, I already said we are happy to sit at the bar.  She then proceeded to tell us there weren't enough seats for the three of us to sit at the bar (that's okay, I don't mind standing).  Also, the restaurant was less than half full and she kept telling us they were too busy to seat us. Ugh, whatever.  We go to the bar, get 2 seats and proceed to wait 15 minutes while every waiter in the place went behind the bar and made drinks. No one even made eye contact with us, no one offered us a drink list or wine list and the hostess even walked behind the bar and ignored us.  Fed up I sent my friend next door to E'toile to see if they had the time to take care of us.  Sure enough they were more than happy to serve us and we happily spent over $300 with them.  We let the hostess at Harvest know we were leaving because of her surly attitude and it just got worse from there.  What a horrible impression she left on us.  My first trip to Madison was definitely memorable. But...a huge thanks goes out to our watier, Frank at L'Etoile. He was the picture of perfection and the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Harvest seemed  too full of themselves and their accolades (3-5 yrs removed) to be truly enjoyable. Good food but lose the elitist foodie attitude, please. Can't stand places and staff that put out the \"you don't realise how lucky you are to eat here and have me as a server\" vibe.  Good beet salad , foie gras, pork loin   & I  recomend  the duck breast if it's available . The portions and pace of meal were ok, decent  wine selection, the space has simple  clean look, and some nice capitol views."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Harvest because I love the farm to table concept.  We had a raw fish appetizer.  I don't mind small dishes, but when the food runner kept looking back after she dropped it off I knew she was waiting for our reaction.  Three tiny slivers of fish topped with two slices of jalapeño.  $14.  My boyfriend had a curry clam dish.  He was very pleased with the amount of clams.  I had the beef New York strip special.  It was well done on some parts and raw On another.  The main reason I give this poor review is because the meat was not beef.  It had silver skin and was some sort of wild game.  Unfortunately, I don't see a reason to return.  For the price I'll go to Tornado Room and leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Went here with my family and couldn't have had a more terrible experience. First, there was some odd object floating in the wine we were served, they claimed it was the cork but it most definitely was not. Then they were offended and were rude when we said we no longer wanted the wine. Next, they brought out their \"corn soup\" which we didn't expect to be excruciatingly spicy and it doesn't say anything on the menu about it being spicy either and they were very rude to us when we told them that it was too spicy for my sister to eat. They laughed in our face and rolled their eyes at us when we had a complaint about the food. I would not recommend this place as it is highly over priced for bad service and not the greatest food."}
{"text":"This place has fallen prey to getting too big for itself.   What do I mean by that?  When Harvest first opened 10+ years ago every meal seemed incredibly well planned and prepared.  It was a perfect place for a special night out.  What it seem to have become is a place that takes on more than it can handle.  We had dinner there last night (Saturday) before theater.  Our reservations were for 6:30 for an 8:00 p.m. show a few blocks away.  There were 2 of us dining.  We were seated promptly at 6:30.  The waiter approached us right way. She was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  We placed drink orders (both had the brown derby...very good cocktail).  When she returned with the cocktail we ordered our full meal.  This was at about 6:45.  We decided to start with a shared Heirloom tomato salad. and then each ordered our entree.  I choose the steak of the day which was a hangar steak.  I asked for it to be medium rare.  My dinner mate chose the bronzini.    We settled in for the expected wonderful meal.  The tomato salad was wonderful.    We then waited, and waited and waited for our entrees.  40 minutes later they arrived.  The waiter apologized and said they just got slammed in the kitchen.    My steak was cold as was the potato side dish.  We had to quickly eat so we could make it to theater on time.  Overall a very disappointing night.  What's gone wrong with Harvest?    I believe the owner is now a partner in multiple restaurant ventures in Madison.  It might be that she has gotten to successful for her own good.  Our entrees were without flavor.  There seemed to be very little originality on the menu for a \"farm to table\" restaurant in September--I great season in southern Wisconsin for so much.  It had been a few years since we last dined here...unfortunately it will be many more if ever."}
{"text":"I had a really disappointing meal at Harvest and I'm not sure if it's because of what I ordered or if it was an off-night or what.  It probably wasn't a good sign that my husband and I and another couple were the only patrons in the restaurant last Thursday night.  Our server was not inept or anything like that, but it was impossible to coax a smile or any friendliness.  He was not informed about the beers on the menu and ended up recommending something he thought might taste like an IPA.  It was a lager... and not a good one.    I ordered the cornmeal crusted fluke over the sunchoke-duck hash, warm winter vegetable slaw with preserved lemon aioli.  The best thing on the plate was the slaw, which was vinegary and crispy.  The fish was cooked perfectly but it tasted a little off, and I can't vouch for the freshness of the Fluke.  The cornmeal crust was only on one piece of the fish and there were three very large filets that totally overwhelmed the plate.    Also overwhelming - the hash.  I guess I assumed there would actually be duck and sunchoke in the hash.  Instead, the (large) potatoes tasted like they had been fried in rendered duck fat.  Sunchoke is a pretty delicate, artichoke-like flavor and it was completely missing from the dish.  The aioli was heavy on the oil and light on the lemon.    The dish was a total miss.  My husband's dinner was the grass-fed grilled beef tenderloin with celeriac and parsley root gratin, roasted cippolini onions and bourboun jus.  The gratin came out cold, but the beef was delicious and medium rare; perfectly cooked.  The dish was passable, nothing either of us would come back to order.  The chevre pumpkin cheesecake was memorable for how heavy of a dessert it was.  We had been hoping for something a little lighter, but this might be our fault.  Combined with the lackluster service, it was a disappointing meal.  Next time we go out for a nice meal, I think we'll stick with what is always good and just go to L'Etoile."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's in a nice location right by the Capitol. It's neat inside, and their back room is really quaint. The service was good.  Their cocktails are good, nothing to rave about. I went on restaurant week and had the chicken confit, braised beef, and some dessert I can't remember.   I would definitely take anyone who was into local/organic stuff there."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for a romantic dinner night.  If you want great, off the beaten path menu this is a great place.  They seated up for a late dinner with no complaints.  I had a steak meal and my husband had a pasta. We also ordered mussels and mushrooms.  We can't say enough about the mushroom dish.  The menu changes according to the chef's preferences and seasonality so don't have your heart set on any one dish.  The only complaints I had was that the restaurant was \"snug\" and I felt a little far away from my husband during dinner, but as the place cleared out and we had the back half almost to ourselves for dessert we were able to cuddle up."}
{"text":"You know, I've had mixed experiences at this restaurant, three extremely good and one...well, not so good.  The first meal was beautifully paced, everything tasted excellent from a creamy mushroom soup to a crispy duck salad to a big fat slice of rare tuna on unimpeachable polenta.  The second one featured just a few delicious bites between my then-fiance and myself late in the evening over some champagne to celebrate our engagement.  We also went to Harvest for our rehearsal dinner. It was a smash! Our server was unbelievable, the wine flowed, the courses were delicious, and everything was beautifully paced out. It wasn't even that catastrophic a bill, since this was during Restaurant Week. They packed in 14 of us, and I was grateful that they were able to accommodate us (we booked early).  We did go one other time and didn't have such a great experience, just pretty darned disgusting sweetbreads (I usually love them), a mediocre main dish and a lame dessert.  Oh well. You can't win 'em all, but Harvest comes close. Fantastic place, and one of the only restaurants in Madison where you'll see a guy in a suit on a regular basis. Frequented by the politicos down on Capitol Square (it's right next to L'Etoile and owned by the same people), but not so much by the UW professorial types -  you'll find them closer to campus at the swankier ethnic joints and, of course, at Sardine."}
{"text":"The front-of-house service was great. The food, not so much. The vegetarian special of the day sounded great so I ordered it, house made pasta with truffles, ricotta, lemon. Tasted like unsalted buttered noodles that I could make at home, there were hints of the ricotta and lemon. The truffles were rather disturbing, chewy bits of something that had once been a living plant, but that was a long time ago. My husband ordered the daily steak special that the menu seemed to indicate would cost $28, actual price was$42. It was decent, but not $42 good. My very plain pasta was $36 ($36!). With two drinks, the bill came to about $92.  With these prices, I expect at least a little bit of amazingness with the food. It wasn't there at all."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week. I would give 5 stars for the food. 3 for the service...so therefore averaging out to a 4.  With their menu ever-changing it is hard to suggest a specific thing to get because the time you dine at the restaurant again it is no longer on the menu. What I will say they my whole entire 3 course meal was consistently great. Unlike my experience at another restaurant for restaurant week where I really only enjoyed the entree out of the 3 courses. I ate everything that was placed in front of me at Harvest. I had the salmon gravlax, braised pork, and quince tart. Everything tasted wonderful.   I found the server and hostess to be a less welcoming than I expected and almost accusatory when there was a reservation misunderstanding."}
{"text":"\"Meh, I've experienced better\" is exactly how we left harvest. First, the service was great. We had absolutely no complaints there, whatsoever.   Now, let's talk food. First came the \"Amuse-bouche\". A chunk of tomato with basil oil and salt. Huh... OK... I've seen a number of reviews here that rave about the hangar steak. Our experience was not the same. Extremely tough, Over-charred on the outside and blue on the inside (ordered medium-rare). The roasted potatoes that came on the plate were roasted to oblivion. Sad, hard, little chunks of dessicated starch. The scallops were fine I suppose. Un-inspired seasoning and drowning in a cream sauce that tasted like melted vanilla ice cream. C'mon man. $100 each is not what you charge for uninspired scallops and murdered steak.  Again, Our server was A++, but that was not enough to make us return, or to not tell others to avoid."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times once with a large family group, and once just two of us. Both times the experience has been very pleasant. Both times we ate outside,  the atmosphere was relaxed, and the wait staff was great. The food was also very good-- a good tight menu with a broad selection (something for everyone) that wasn't too overwhelming (each dish seems to have been well thought out). I think everyone really enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"5 stars for the music.  4 stars for the effort and lay out. I wish I could have seen the back room.  3.5 stars for the taste of my food was okay.  I have the watermelon salad, Braised Beef Short Ribs, Sorbet with sugar cookie.   Service = the \"Meh, I've had better.\" She did leave me alone but didn't explain or offer to explain any options to the dining menu for restaurant week as I overheard another server provide and I would have totally picked that option.   The braised beef ribs tasted like any beef from a pot roast. It wasn't overcooked just nothing to write home about. The vegetables that the beef sat on top of was ok but again lacked a great flavor for me YET the sliced ginger sold it. It wrapped all the items well.  The butter served with the bread is plain but man it's really fresh butter.    Server helpers were efficient. Place filled up quickly at 5:30pm I guess others held the same idea as me - get in and get out before the crowd.   I would return for the flavor options on that sorbet but compared to the cheesecake and olive oil cake slices the portion size was much smaller.   I did want to try the cucumber wasabi gazpacho but stuck with the salad after learning the soup wasn't garnished with a seafood.   I would recommend the place for a date night, business meeting or family outing. Simple and to the point is what I like. This place provides that.   Sidenote: I think the Restaurant week menu is more appealing than the daily menu but obviously this isn't a reflection of poor options or quality every other day because the place remains full. I'm just stating what I thought."}
{"text":"First off the location is ideal... it looks right over the Capitol and in Madison, that's as pretty of a view you're going to get for a down town dinner. Chris went w his b school class and learned all about how passionate they are about organic and sustainable food. You can definitely tell. For me, even the tomatoes were scrumptious and I think that is because they were freshly picked from the chef's mini garden. The service was fantastic, very polite, treating you like royalty without being pretentious or floofy. We need to go there again so we can write a more robust review. (Chris has been there 3 times and has adored each visit!) The only downside (if any) is that it is a little pricey for rustic elegance. We will go there again soon and report back... ~Christerra"}
{"text":"Walked into Harvest after a Badger's football game in October '13. Asked for a table for 3 for a quick bite... was asked if we had a reservation... (\"no\")... were told it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait. The restaurant was about 90% vacant at that time. We figured we weren't dressed well enough or something, but left scratching our heads. Should've learned my lesson...   Dinner with our youngest son's girlfriend, her parents and grandfather the night before graduation this year (May 15). Nine of us at a round banquet table in the back of the house by the kitchen door... charming ambiance back there. Servers were very efficient and pleasant, as were the front-of-house staff. Wine was very nice (Starmont Cab, 2011... be sure to specify the correct bin number as they have multiple vintages, some at over twice the 2011 price). Appetizers for the most part were exceptional. Mussels in a sweet and spicy sauce with crusty toast planks. Should've had a meal sized portion and called it good. Four ordered the beef tenderloin. I was asked how I'd like it prepared and I asked server how the chef recommends. she said \"medium rare\". After waiting approximately 45 minutes, one steak came out medium, and 3 came out bloody and cold in the center. I believe the strange taste was likely blood. Instead of sending back to the grill, I ate around the edges and left the rest. Salt and/or pepper was needed badly, but none available on the table. A salad was to follow the main course in the chef's menu. Server came out from kitchen and asked, \"since it's getting late the chef is wondering if you really want the salad course\"... The reason it was getting late was likely that lag between excellent appetizers and horribly prepared main course (the salmon was adequate according to others at our table). We told the server we definitely wanted to see the salads. They arrived promptly, a nice selection of fresh greens with virtually no dressing of any kind. We laughed and said the bottle must have been almost empty, but if you face that at home you drizzle some EVO on the greens, throw some course grind pepper on top and call it good. No such effort here. Desserts were unique and very flavorful. Very good sorbet, mousse, banana/chocolate dish. All good endings to a very lengthy meal that started strong, dropped hard in the middle (the beef anyway), and finished strong.  Too many other good restaurants in Madison to spend $100/cover at Harvest. Possibly our expectations were too high to start, but can't afford to support the same mistakes I've read about in other Yelp reviews in the future."}
{"text":"What a fantastic fine dining option in Madison.   In town for UW graduation, we made a reservation here to celebrate, and by the end of the evening, i was celebrating the fantastic meal too.   I was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of the service we had that night. The waiter was pleasant and offered great suggestions for dinner and drink.   While there were a cornucopia of fine fresh pastas and meats available, i opted for the grass-fed skirt steak, which came out cooked perfect at medium. There were some fingerling potatoes on the side, which were baked and seasoned well.   After dinner, I had some fine 12 year-old single malt scotch, neat of course. That capped an excellent dinner.   Sure this place is a expensive, but is well worth it to celebrate an occasion and to see how food raised in a simple, correct way can stand out from the rest. A+!"}
{"text":"I was out here for a business trip, so I decided to give Harvest a try after perusing through my hotel's business directory.  Since I was solo for the night, I selected 3 first courses to get a sampling. Each dish was simple, but delicious!   I had the slow roasted beet salad with hazelnuts and blue cheese, the grilled marinated squid with grapefruit, olives, and citrus, and finally the grilled guinea hen with balsamic vinaigrette. Each dish was exquisitely prepared and wonderfully presented. I thought the squid was a little too powerful for me, since it would swing from super sweet to extremely salty. But I loved the grilled leg of guinea hen and the beets were so fresh and thirst-quenching.   I haven't been to Chez Panisse in Berkeley in awhile, but I think Harvest definitely ranks up there for organic goodness!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that it's probably unfair to review a restaurant of Harvest's caliber based on a stop during restaurant week. I had never eaten at Harvest before, but it's been on my list for a long time, and $25 for a Harvest meal is probably the best deal you can get. However, anyone who does food in Madison should expect that restaurant week, while it gives you a good opportunity to sample various spots without breaking the bank, does not always represent the restaurants at their best.   Anyways... I had a lovely meal. I stopped in on Sunday on my way home. I was on my own, which didn't bother me, but I was definitely out of place in the crowded dining room. I ate the chicken confit appetizer, the heirloom tomato risotto, and the mojito sorbet. Everything was relatively simple but had wonderful flavor. I don't remember the last time I actually ate chicken in a real restaurant but if they all tasted like that chicken I might do it more. The size was surprising for an appetizer (a whole thigh). The slaw was a nice, bright accompaniment. The risotto had lovely, bright flavors. I especially liked the basil oil at the base of the dish. The mojito sorbet was very good, but verrry sweet. I also did not get much \"mojito\" from it; seemed more like a lemoncello flavor, but still tasty. My only complaint with the dishes was presentation (it was just boring, not sloppy), but given the high output of restaurant week I wasn't surprised.  My server was excellent. Despite the high traffic, she made time to talk to me about the food and the restaurant and was very familiar with all the dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend made reservations here for a special Valentine's Day dinner. Even though we were a few minutes late, we were seated right away. The service was excellent - friendly, helpful and attentive. And best of all, no attitude.  For the first course, I had seared scallops (which melted in my mouth). My boyfriend opted for the salad. Then we were presented with celery root soup compliments of the chef. For the next course, I had the house-made cavatelli with pork sausage, and my boyfriend ordered the pork loin. For dessert, we shared some homemade caramel ice cream. Everything we ate was amazing, and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face the entire time!  The cocktails were excellent as well. I had a Canton sidecar (which went perfectly with the scallops) and an elderflower gimlet.  This place is fantastic. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Our meal was wonderful, I had the poached egg on polenta with bacon jam. The polenta was really the best I have had. My husband had the roasted romaine salad. Main course was just as good, Mahi Mahi and hanger steak. The wine list is great. Another important note, service was excellent. Overall experience will have us returning. Thank you Harvest for a fabulous dining experience."}
{"text":"My folks are in town and Graze had a 40 minute wait, so we wandered into Harvest. To be honest, I was not very impressed.   The three stars (more like 2.5) are for ambience and service, both of which were excellent. The food, however, really failed to impress.   Harvest has a fairly limited menu that's devoid of anything that stands out. There's nothing innovating or adventurous.   They started us off with an amuse bouche, which is a nice touch. They might as well have skipped it, though, since the red pepper soup was lukewarm and bland.   My wife and I started with the charcuterie plate for two. You might think that the designation \"for two\" would suggest that you're going to get a lot of food. It doesn't-- it means that you'll get two bites of everything. That's ok, though-- I'm trying to cut down on my portions anyway. There were two smoked meats, which were decent, a sausage that was tasty but on the bland side, and some bread. Everything was fine.   For entrees we had a linguine in a red sauce and the trout. The linguine was definitely not linguine. I think it was fettuccine.  My wife described the flavor as \"nice and fresh\" but bland. She felt it needed more seasoning. The portion was also quite small.   The trout was extremely bland and on the dry side. Again, the portion was quite small.  My father had a hanger steak special. He ordered it medium, and it came out a very red medium-rare. It was-- you guessed it-- bland and under seasoned.   Desserts were completely forgettable.   The experience doesn't come close to justifying the price. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly good either.   Update: I went to a wedding celebration at Harvest last night and it was incredible. The food was delicious and the staff did an amazing job. There wasn't a single hitch all night. This still isn't my favorite dinner spot, but they definitely deserve an extra star for a flawless event."}
{"text":"Going to Harvest, for me, is like taking an hour-long bubble bath or eating a whole pint of ice cream: it's something that's totally luxurious, totally enjoyable, and totally done only eveeeerrrrry once in a while.  I went to Harvest with a gift certificate burning a hole in my pocket recently and, I'LL TELL YOU, it wasn't hard to spend faster than you can say \"amuse bouche.\" They offer half bottles of wine, which are nice for two people to share, and the wine list is very extensive. They're accommodating with special diet requests (they've made a vegan entrée for me every time I've asked), and always have a vegetarian option on the regular menu. Highlights from my most recent dinner: trio color salad (fresh and delicious!) and our awesome server.   The prices are steep compared to the usual Madison fare, but the food is high quality and prices reflect it. As I said, it's luxurious and enjoyable, but someplace I go only for a truly special night out."}
{"text":"I took my friends out for a thank you dinner.  The host was very nice as were the servers.  We chose to sit in the back room, and when we mentioned that it was a little too chilly for us, they promptly altered the temperature.   The meal started with a complimentary amuse bouche of cold pea soup served in tureens.  Very tasty; creamy with the pea flavor coming through very well.  The three of us split 2 appetizers: mussels that were cooked in a clean, herb-y broth and the marinated grilled squid.  Both were cooked perfectly.  The mussel flavor was very bright and the squid dish had the inventive pairing with olives.  My friend ordered the halibut, which had olive tapenade and other vegetables including leek and fennel.  She enjoyed it.  Her husband ordered the skirt steak; he asked for the harissa sauce to be put on the side, which I think was a good move for him -- it wasn't his favorite flavor profile.  The chickpea fries were delicious and the steak was tender and perfection.  I ordered the homemade tagliatelle with pork sausage, kale, and chili flakes.  It was a solid meal -- nothing too exceptional aside from the perfectly delicious steak -- no surprises, but good.  We loved that the portions were reasonable; not too small not too large.  We split the strawberry-rhubarb tart which was not groundbreaking, but very tasty."}
{"text":"I look forward to trying new restaurants when away from my East Coast hometown.   My meal at Harvest was something that I will not soon forget.  From the presentation of each course, to the ingredients, and the service, this is an establishment I would absolutely recommend.    A reservation had been made for us since we were a large party that required a private room and a prix fixe menu.  Our experience started off with simple introductions by the staff members along with an explanation of how our meal would proceed.  The staff that attended to our party did an outstanding job that complemented the dishes that they served us.  The arugula salad with pickled blueberries was something I will crave until my next trip to Madison. The salmon was a hit with our entire table and the desserts could only have been improved if you had served me one of each!    Our entire dining experience exceeded my expectations.  This is an annual dinner for a group that can be finicky eaters but they had nothing but words of praise for this farm to table cuisine."}
{"text":"PROS: Ambiance, beautiful plating CONS: Everything else  When you sit around sullenly hoping that the desserts will finally redeem the restaurant, you can conclude that it is not a good restaurant. Nothing was above average. Many dishes were flat out bad. The plating was very pretty, but that cannot save a bad dish.  Unfortunately, I had high hopes for this place based on recommendations but I don't see the merit."}
{"text":"After our Saturday evening plans for Fresco fell through, my husband and I were searching for a nicer restaurant for dinner.  We decided on Harvest and sat at a table outside.  The service was impeccable, but not pretentious or overbearing.  Our food was outstanding - I had a pasta dish, my husband had the chicken and we split the seasonal mushrooms  (incredible!!).  The portion sizes were just right and did I mention the food was outstanding??  I look forward to visiting again and trying some more of their offerings.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the lack of 'ambiance' in their outdoor area."}
{"text":"There really isn't the need to go to a pretentious and rather obnoxious restaurant to get such a small amount of so-so food for a disproportional amount of money with inconsiderate service to boot.    Furthermore, serving potatoes and white bread, it is clear that this restaurant has no knowledge of what constitutes a healthy meal.  (If you don't either then you might consult the book, \"Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School guide to healthy eating.\")  The service started out bad and got worse.  When we arrived only 1 of the 8 or so tables for two was occupied, and the attempted to seat us right next to the other occupied table so that we'd have to listen to the other couple and vice-versa.  We refused that table and opted for one a few yards away, only to find that the person seated in the aisle-most seat constantly gets bumped by waiters coming back and forth to the tables in the front section.  The server could have warned us about this and seated us at another of the many empty tables for two, but she failed to do so.   When we left there was still only one other couple in the two-seater section, there really was no excuse for being placed at a table where you get repeatedly jossled by cross-traffic, nor was there any excuse for having the aisle so narrow near a table.  I became truly angry at this restaurant when the food arrived.  I got the Salmon, and there WASN'T MUCH OF IT THERE.  The waiter arrived to ask how the first few bites were, and I almost told him that actually there were only three bites there.  It was supposed to come with some other vegetable-type stuff, and there was also very little of that.  The salmon wasn't cooked that well, certainly the stuff I make at home is better.    The infuriating service will spoil the mood, this is not the place for any sort of social occasion."}
{"text":"I went to this place 5 yrs ago and wasn't crazy about it so I haven't been back until tonight.   I wasn't wrong.   Not impressed at all.  I can't figure out why it gets lauded. We sat with no one paying us any attention for several minutes.  Finally someone came over, and she seemed to have no clue about the menu.  The service was bad.  Not at all worth the cost. I'll stick with Graze."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were in Madison on a business trip and had searched for organic restaurant. We wanted to eat something on the road that was as healthy as something we'd make at home. We were NOT disappointed!  The service was fantastic; when we couldn't decide what to have, our server suggested that since they weren't incredibly busy, they'd be willing to split everything for us. Thus dinner became a four-course event!  We started with a roasted beet and quinoa salad; it was very surprising! Homemade feta complimented the beets perfectly and added the right, salty kick. Our next course was the lamb ragu. The lamb shank was braised and incredibly tender. The homemade pasta was the ideal consistency; very al dente. For our third course, we split the grass-fed skirt steak. It was equally delicious, with pickled onions, mint, and just a hint of chili. The chickpea fries were a real treat -- I'm going to try to make these at home!  We finished the meal with a local cheese plate. As my coworker had never been to Wisconsin, I convinced her this was a must. The Gouda, aged cheddar and blue cheeses were well suited with a fruit compote and crispy olive bread.  An extensive wine list (that even contained a delicious nonalcoholic cider for me -- stinks being a pregnant lady with a discerning palate!) and soothing decor completed the evening. I will definitely stop here again on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"I flew home to Madison today to surprise my mom and dad for mother's day. For a special gift I wanted to take her out to dinner tonight. The schmanciest restaurant L'Etoile was booked so I settled on Harvest. It sported a good review from the NYTimes, some lackluster and slim feedback on Yelp and Zagat totally dropped the Mad-town ball with only TWO restaurants listed here. Tsk tsk Zagat.  But my mom had heard about Harvest and got excited about going. She dressed up all nice in a cute pink summer coat and white pants while my dad put on a nice black turtle neck, jacket and slacks. To compliment my handsome parents I wore my travel dirty Yelp blue hoody, distressed jeans and Bonnydoon t-shirt. Before you cry foul I wasn't dressing the role of privileged california boy slacker - actually my suitcase got lost by the f***ers at United and it was that or wear my dad's clothes which were a couple sizes too giant for me.  Harvest is on the square and has a lot going for it. Charming, warm decor, in an intimate cozy setting. Our server was fantastic, actually a recent San Francisco transplant.  We started the meal with a complimentary potato and leak soup - a tad salty but nice. We savored an appetizer of morel mushrooms sauteed in butter, served in a type of gravy - butter gravy perhaps?  It was a night for red meat in the midwest - my mom had hanger steak, my dad Wisconsin bison (who knew?) and I had beef short ribs. My mom's steak was a tad chewy, but had amazing flavor. My short ribs were fantastically lush, flavorful and rich - definitely the best.  For dessert we shared an almond cake and chocolate cake. This was the only unsatisfactory part of the dinner - imagine two crappy cupcakes with a weak spoonful of ice cream. Where the hell was the choco-goo, choco-lava, or almond creme. What a cop-out for $10 a dessert.  But all in all we shared a fantastic time. My folks didn't even mind staying out past 9pm :) Harvest promotes organic foods raised from local farms delivered fresh to your table. It was well worth it. While the cost was high for midwest standards, I've paid far more for far less. And my parents and I didn't even try to strangle each other once while talking about politics!"}
{"text":"Great service. The meat based dishes all looked great but unfortunately the salads were underdressed and the curried squash risotto was bland and boring. We went during restaurant week so maybe it's a fluke as they are just cranking out the same dish over and over... As I scanned the restaurant, everyone who ordered the risotto either asked for salt and pepper to help jazz up the dish or just didn't eat much of it as I did. Seemed like meat was the strength of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Celebration group dinner was not good.  Food was mediocre, portions small,and worst of all the private menu did not respect the specifications of the hosts:  contained pork and shellfish dishes which were an embarrassment.  In addition, the A/V system did not work, preventing showing of carefully planned presentation.  Maybe they were overloaded, but beware of planning an event with them.  On gthe positive side, the waitpersons were very pleasant."}
{"text":"Girls night out during Restaurant Week was a lot of fun.  We all tried something different so we could get a wider taste of options.  Although the pumpkin soup was flavorful, it was a little thin for my personal preference.  The short ribs were so tender and pretty amazing.  Dessert was my least favorite of the three, the apple crisp was just middle of the road.  The Pinot Noir with dinner was excellent; however, the after dinner cappuccino turned out to be an over hot latte.  Not bad, just not made correctly.  The service was very good.  Our server provided good descriptions of our options, was very attentive and friendly and offered good suggestions for drink and wine pairings."}
{"text":"We hosted our son and daughter-in-law's rehearsal dinner at Harvest in September 2010 in their private dining room.  We had 44 guests.  We could not have been more pleased.  The room was lovely, the tables were elegant and the atmosphere was festive, yet intimate.  The canapes, entrees and desserts were delicious, the wine was excellent and the service was impeccable.  Tami and Derek were attentive to every detail.  Lastly, Harvest is fully equipped to display your DVD presentation.  We would definitely recommend Harvest for a special event."}
{"text":"Re-confirmed my earlier disappointment once again during the Restaurant Week. It was as if they didn't even know what \"polenta\" is, but decided to put on the menu anyways.  The polenta with mushrooms and gorgonzola (+ some very soggy greens) was awful. And I don't want anyone to take it lightly - it was god awful. The polenta itself was so waterly and loose that it left me so puzzled to see it on a flat plate. It was like trying to eat soup out of a large flat plate with a fork. Normally, I don't eat like that.   The accompanied mushroom was overcooked and over salted. The cook/chef needed to understand the salt amount of gorgonzola in flavoring the mushroom. I also think that there are other ways to flavor a dish than throwing a more than handful of salt.  Overall, I'm glad that I tried Harvest again. I'm glad to finally confirm that it's not worth coming here."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a decent experience at this organic friendly restaurant in the heart of downtown Madison by the capitol.  I had the duck confit which was good but not great.  My wife had the salmon dish which was ok but overcooked.  I like the idea of using local products but now wowed by the restaurant.  We sat in their private room which was essentially an extension of the main restaurant.  We did a half bottle of wine of which they have a good selection.  Signature cocktails were also good.  Service was good as well."}
{"text":"I visited Harvest while in Madison for a wedding and we had our rehearsal dinner here the night before the wedding.  Everything was fantastic-the private room, the service, the DELICIOUS food!  I had the Chilled Pea Soup and the Ricotta Gnocchi and both were fantastic.  Everyone else at my table thoroughly enjoyed their choices as well.  The servers were very attentive, refilling our water and wine before we would even think to ask.  They did a fantastic job and I would definitely make a return trip to Harvest when visiting Madison again."}
{"text":"I received mixed reviews on the place, but our experience was outstanding! The food and service were both top notch. My only complaint is that the menu is somewhat limited, there aren't a whole lot of meal options, but you really can't go wrong with whatever you order."}
{"text":"I've heard that some restaurants try to hide the fact that they are participating in Restaurant Week by making the menu difficult to find, while others tend to treat Restaurant Week diners as second-class patrons. This wasn't at all the case at Harvest. In fact, it seemed like Restaurant Week was their main focus of the week.  Why did I get this feeling? First, the set menus had already been placed on our table before we were seated, which was great! We didn't even have to ask. Second, the food was served REALLY quickly, so I'm guessing they had some sort of assembly line set up in the kitchen solely for the RW menu items. Honest to God, we barely had 2-3 minutes between courses to digest. It did feel a little rushed - I mean, I don't know of many restaurants that can serve a three course meal in under an hour - but then again, I was famished, so I didn't mind too much.  I ordered the crispy bacon-potato salad, the braised beef shortribs, and the bourbon-rootbeer ice cream. Portions are small, but filling. The bacon-potato salad was nothing special - pretty much a light, palate cleanser for me. The shortrib entree was definitely the highlight of the meal. The meat was super flavorful and fell apart easily. I also tried my dad's pork shoulder and it was nice and stringy, just the way I like it! I guess that's what you get for a nice long overnight roast! As for the dessert, I couldn't taste the bourbon in the ice cream, but the sassafras definitely provided a nice kick. :9  Harvest is a must-try during Restaurant Week!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and it was AMAZING! We had heard about it from one of those Madison magazines that named him Chef of the Year at some point, and we decided to branch out from our normal spots and try it.  A little hard to find based on the minimal signage but once we did it was WELL worth it.  The inside is so simple and clean.  We got seated at a half booth table and felt very comfortable.  Our waitress was wonderful and very attentive and helpful.  She knew every question we asked her and explained the Harvest concept perfectly.  My bf loves to try new things and I do too, but I was skeptical about the pureed green soup set before me.  It was UNBELIEVABLE.  The presentation was so cute in the white teacup with saucer and the mix of flavors blew me away.  I had a seafood dish and my bf had a steak. I can't begin to explain how wonderful everything was.  Very expensive, but so worth it.  I had two or three of those Door County Cherry Martinis and fell IN LOVE with them. The chef even came out and talked to us for a bit and made us feel completely at ease.  Wish I could go back weekly but just don't have the dough for that.  Highly recommend trying Harvest.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Before going, I read all of the reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere.  The ratings seemed inconsistent, and it was hard to gauge how eating here would really be.  So, I went last night (4/24/10) with my girlfriend, a colleague from work, and two other friends.  We arrived on time for our reservation, and we were seated promptly.  Menus were already placed at our table, along with the wine/drink list.  Water glasses were full.  We waited for about 15-20 minutes before anyone came over to us.  The first person to do so was a voiceless girl with a pitcher of water.  She filled our glasses and moved on.  A couple of minutes later, a server walked over and asked if anyone had been with us.  We told her no, and she noted that and went to get someone.  Moments later, we had a waiter at our table ready to take our order.  We ordered a bottle of wine (a Chilean Carrignan), and he was off to get it.  The wine was served shortly after, and the only complaint here is that the waiter was terrible at wine service.  He struggled with getting the bottle open, and then he poured wine on the tablecloth and the menu.  It wasn't too much though, and maybe he was new.  In any case, after pouring the wine for us, he brought out small samples of celeriac soup.  They were delicious, and a tasty start to the meal.  Along with the soup came one fresh-baked roll.  The roll was perfect, and while one was plenty, I wished there were two.  Our first courses were ordered and came out promptly.  I had the lentil soup, which was amazing.  The others had the roasted beet salad or the green salad.  Those were also met with smiles, and everything looked as good as it tasted.  Our first bottle of wine was gone, and our waiter asked if we wanted another.  I ordered a nice Rioja for our second courses, which were all red meat (most of us ordered the grilled skirt steak with harissa and mint, my girlfriend had the special NY Strip).  The second bottle poured as awkwardly as the first, and our food arrived just as the last glass was being poured.  Each second course looked great, and they were all cooked to perfection (rare, medium rare or medium...depending on the person).  I sampled my girlfriend's rare Strip and it was amazing.  The flavor profile of my dish, the skirt steak, was completely different but equally tasty.  I also enjoyed the crispy chickpea fries that accompanied the dish.  The harissa, a kind of hot chili paste, was perfect in terms of heat and flavor.  The mint brought it all together well, and this was unexpected for me since I wasn't eating lamb.  After our second course, the cheese plate arrived (we had ordered it earlier and it is usually served after dinner).  The cheeses were all very good, especially the buttermilk blue and bandage cheddar.  The olive bread that came with it was very good as well.  The best part were candied cashews and a fruit compote that, with the three types of cheese, provided a number of interesting and satisfying permutations of flavor and texture.  We, literally, scraped the plate clean.  Dessert was offered, but we were too full, and I recommended against it anyway since the only thing people could agree on in the many reviews of this restaurant, was that the dessert was a let down.  Overall, I would give Harvest 4.5 stars.  The only thing to complain about was the initial wait and the wine pouring.  Those are being very nitpicky though!  The portion sizes were not pretentiously small, as some people have written.  In fact, I thought they were quite normal and walking out of the restaurant I was not stuffed and uncomfortable but feeling perfectly sated.  The wine list is extensive with a variety of price levels, which I always appreciate.  The food was impeccably prepared, matched with side items well, and some of the best food I've eaten.  The service was very good, and the bill was high but worth the price (and cheaper than what you'd find in bigger cities).  Each person ended up paying $63, before tip, for the following:  (on the house soup sample & roll) first course second course part of the cheese plate 2 glasses of wine  Some people have complained about the atmosphere, but I find it to be very warm and comfortable.  The night we were there, the restaurant was nearly-full, and it wasn't loud or annoying (i.e. long waits for food).    What really puts everything over the top is that everything is so fresh, locally sourced whenever possible, organic and in season.  You might find other restaurants at this price level that provide a similar experience, but it is very difficult to find one that works with this kind of food and delivers such an amazing product.  I have eaten at a number of very fine-dining restaurants, some of which cost far more than Harvest, but I found the experience at Harvest to be similar or better in almost every way.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The only people who could be disappointed with this place are terribly unlucky or have outrageous expectations"}
{"text":"We had a large group dine at Harvest on a weekday evening and were able to secure the private room upstairs, which seats about a bit under 20. We got a set menu that included several options for each course. I opted for the beet soup, which was amazing. It had a hint of cream in it which gave it a silky texture. For my main I had the steak which was well cooked and came with some nice accompaniments - except they didn't have horseradish. The chocolate desert was mousse like and a nice way to close out the evening. The wine and beer list is pretty comprehensive and includes variety in both type and price. If you're in the Madison area, this is worth a stop. After or before dinner there a few bars close by, but you can also stroll around the capital building and work off your meal. This place is far enough away from State Street that it doesn't get to wild, which makes it nice for a business meal or date night."}
{"text":"We dined at Harvest on May 10th. The evening started out well. The excellent wait staff recommended a terrific wine and the chef sent out a tiny but incredible sample of a relish.  The carrot ginger soup is wonderful. However, the field greens salad was sliced greens without dressing. Really nothing special. Entrees of salmon, risotto and hanger steak were beautifully presented and prepared. Desert is where things derailed. The lemon cake tasted like a dry cornbread muffin. The trifle was a sad joke - ingredients thrown together.  I would advise asking a lot of questions before ordering."}
{"text":"First time eating here. We went here on a Wednesday without a reservation and got right in. Waitress was great and efficient. We got are drinks right away. Ordered some appetizers as well as our entrees. With a great surprise and compliments of the chef we had a cream of corn or something along those lines which was delicious.  Then our entrees arrived and we were like ok I guess we won't be getting our appetizers. When our waitress came over to check on us she noticed we never received them so she brought them out anyway and we got them comped.  I had the scallops which are to die for and for my entree I got the steak of the day which was a hangar steak. OMG.......can I say delish!  I would definitely go back and recommend this restaurant. It's a bit on the upscale side with white table cloths and all but great restaurant to bring business partners or a date."}
{"text":"I am very sorry to report that my party did not have a good dining or service experience at Harvest.  We were a table of 8 on a Monday night, and when we arrived at 6:30 it was not busy, so there was every opportunity for good service.  However, after our drinks were served and our order taken it became impossible to find our server or to get anyone's attention.    The bottom line is that the menu is extremely limited as well as unusual.  It took a full hour to receive our first course after we ordered and another full hour to receive our entrees.  Everyone in our group became restless.  Although the food sounded interesting, it really wasn't anything special.  I had the parsnip soup, which was very bland, and the salmon, which had a slight ammonia flavor."}
{"text":"If Justin Carlisle is their chef still, then you're in for a treat. He is one of the best Midwestern chefs I have had the pleasure to work for, although he was only the sous at the time.   I've tried many meals from this kitchen and everything has been delicious. I believe the hanger steak is the staple I this restaurant. The marinade and tenderness of the meat makes it the best thing I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Harvest has been on my list of places to try for years, and this past restaurant week I finally got the chance.  We arrived right on time for our reservation and were seated promptly.  Because the two seating areas are separated, they retain an intimate atmosphere without feeling too cramped.  Sometimes the most challenging part of restaurant week - especially when trying someplace for the first time - is choosing just one option.  Our waiter was helpful in sharing suggestions when asked, both from the cocktail and dinner menus.  In the end my dining companion and I settled on splitting two entries since neither of us could narrow down our selection to one.    For the starter I had the roasted pumpkin soup.  While good, this was my least favorite of the three courses, as it was served lukewarm.  For dinner we split the braised beef short ribs and the thai coconut mussels.  The short ribs were simply amazing.  Cooked to tender perfection, the meat fell easily apart and practically melted in my mouth.  Compared to the rich flavors of the beef, the broth for the mussels felt bland and far from spicy.  The mussels themselves made up for whatever was lacking in the broth, though.  They were plump and juicy to the last, none overcooked or chewy.  The only other thing this dish needed was more bread for soaking up the broth.  For dessert my friend chose the buttered popcorn ice cream which was an intriguing blend of salty and sweet.  I ordered the quince tart, which was a delicious cap to a solid meal.  The tart was heavily spiced and tasted like fall, with the cool creme chantilly rounding out the flavor.  Overall, Harvest made a great first impression."}
{"text":"I was very excited about our meal due to their focus on organic and local ingredients; the patio was also pleasant and romantic.  Unfortunately, the food itself took a dive.  We started with an amuse bouche and salad that were both disappointing to my husband; our entree was the grass feed hanger steak.  I spent about four minutes trying to chew each bite (some I simply couldn't), and it was honestly the toughest meat I have ever had in a restaurant.  I am unsure about why they purchased this meat and chose to sell it as a steak, as opposed to either purchasing a more tender cut OR using this cut in another fashion (i.e., beef bourguignon or something that would tenderize the meat properly, as the French due with their poor meat cuts).  Also the spicy seasoning on the meat overwhelmed it, such that none of the steak flavor came out in the mouth.  Steak isn't a flavor that you want to cover up!  I liked the dessert, but husband didn't.  Between the five things we tried he liked none.  There are much better options for local/organic food.  Oooh, and it's very expensive to be experimenting with your dinner...."}
{"text":"The menu blends modern technique and rustic farm-to-table fare into exquisite and delectable dishes. Their most entry level item is a mixed green salad that stands apart from those you have had elsewhere. The main course of a Bison steak and roasted brussels sprouts will stand in my memory for a great long time. And their pot de creme will elevate your standards for rich chocolate desserts. My partner enjoyed the Amberjack with Thai-coconut foam. This eatery easily makes our top 5 places to dine in Madison."}
{"text":"After twice getting upset stomachs after eating here, we will not return.  Once, I can forgive but twice...?"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant that I visited for Madison's restaurant week.  Service was fast and there was a table available for me even though I didn't make any reservation. I had the bird terrine as an appetizer and contrary to the description, it wast crispy. It was a saltier than expected but the meat was very tender and juicy.  For the main course, I had the fried fish which was good. The dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"We went to Harvest for a NYE dinner; 3 couples total.  The wine and the service were spot on.  Greeted promptly and our waitress and the bussers were fun and attentive.  The wine menu is superb and our choices were delicious.  My main reason for a 'meh' review:  the prices for our meal size was pretty outrageous compared to the other fancy places we frequent, and the food wasn't amazing.  Good, but not great by any means.  Granted, this may be due to holiday demand and back of house pressure.  The portions were stingy at best; I ordered a veggie plate and literally got half a sweet potato, half of a beet, and one halved brussels sprout with dressing for $24.  Even though we spent over $500 total, we left and went out for pizza an hour later (including the people that ordered $40+ beef dishes).  I might go back on a non-holiday non-weekend day to give it another shot.  Maybe."}
{"text":"I am Mad about Madtown!! homemade bread accompanies your meal - supa delish! I had a vegetarian meal and it was superb. My hubby did the hanger steak and was so happy w/ it - he is pretty fastidious so, happy he to see him beaming at me! Looking forward to our next visit and to see what seasonal offerings are to be had :)"}
{"text":"Solid food, but lacking in creativity for the prices you pay here.   Yeah, the cuts of meat and veggies are fresh. I've gone here several times and it's got pleasant ambiance, attentive waiters, and filling dishes, but it just doesn't have the spark that makes you go, oh my gosh, that was an amazing experience.   I did really enjoy the mussels appetizer- the spicy tomato broth really makes the dish."}
{"text":"Absolutely great joint. The attention to detail to dishes is unbelievable. They do have a very simple and short menu but everything is delish!"}
{"text":"Two stars for a well trained staff, \"are you finished enjoying your plate?\" isn't even uttered by any of the more sophisticated dining establishments in NYC or LA.  But the food was disappointing, considering that they've been written up by the NYT as a must visit restaurant in Madison.  And they've hosted James Beard diners!    I had several appetizers and a dessert: on the octopus salad, only one piece was cooked correctly, the rest too soggy or chewy.  The seared scallops was the better option, cooked to perfection, but the eggplant puree and chutney were rather unneccessary accompaniments - that could be the purist in me.  The cauliflower soup was nice, balanced w/ roasted apples.     The homemade watermelon-basil sorbet had an extremely inconsistent texture...was this deliberate?  were the differently sized ice chunks amidst the sorbet supposed to convince me that it was really home made?   I worried initially that the basil might be hidden in the watermelon, but quite the opposite was true - the watermelon was completely lost in the syrupy sweetness of the basil.  If fresh basil was actually used, there was a very heavy hand w/ the sugar.    A restaurant that posts the accolades that Harvest posts on their website should be able to maintain and live up to their standards.  This is definitely not a must visit restaurant in Madison in my book."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for restaurant week to check it out, but likely won't return. First our server didn't acknowledge our presence for longer than normal (I was a waitress and even if you're busy you can always nod and smile or say you'll be there in a few minutes). He also wasn't very friendly. The bread/butter was tasty but the rest of our food was small portioned and not very flavorful. I had the risotto and it was something I could have made with not much time or effort. You can't beat the location since it's right around the square, but we'll go elsewhere for flavorful food that actually satiates."}
{"text":"Came here during Winter Restaurant Week with my husband and brother. I was very excited because I've heard this place is really good and we normally would not be able to afford to come here. I got the squash soup for an appetizer and it was amazing!! It was so creamy and flavorful. My husband and brother both got the dish that was suppose to be similar to German potato salad but it was cold and I thought it tasted nothing like it. Neither of them really liked it even though that was what the waitress recommended. For an entree I got the roasted chicken breast, my husband got the chicken and short ribs (you get get 2 meats for $6 extra) and my brother got the ribs. The chicken was very juicy and had lots of flavor. The ribs were good too but it was a very small portion and my brother was upset that he didn't order a 2nd meat also. For desert we all order the crack pie which was recommended to us. Honestly if there hadn't been cherries on the plate next to it, I probably wouldn't have finished it. It was pretty bland but the cherries really went well with it. The meal was pretty good overall but had we come here and paid full price, I would have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Harvest is our family's go-to restaurant for special occasions.  We have always had good-or-better service, a pleasant surprise in Madison.  The menu is not necessarily cutting edge, but is nevertheless exciting and broad enough to cover a wide variety of tastes.  The meals are beautifully presented, and the flavors fantastic.    Because the menu rotates, it is difficult to give specific recommendations.  Typically, I will combine a beet salad (or something similar) with steak.  The last time I went, however, I ate tapas-style, and sampled ahi tuna poke (good), grilled baby octopus (very good), and truffled polenta cake with duck egg (amazing umami flavor).  If there are mushrooms on the menu, I suggest trying them.  I'm usually not a big fan of dessert, but Harvest's desserts are elegant and refreshing, and the budino I had last week was no exception.  My only advice would be to not go during restaurant week (too crowded, menu not quite as varied) - but otherwise I have no reservations about recommending it for birthdays, anniversaries, out-of-town guests, and so on."}
{"text":"Very very good food and quality service to go with it. This is the restaurant that convinced a friend of mine that vegetables could taste good too, despite being a meat-and-potatoes sorta man. It's pricy but interesting and worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"If you want THE BEST cuisine made with the absolute freshest ingredients, and the perfect paired wine to delect your experience, this is it.  I am in love with Harvest, mainly because the quintessential collection of what's good in a restaurant in my opinion.  Perfect portion size.  Flavor to die for.  Not a lot of options, but rather the BEST of the season.  Some may want the ten thousand choices, but believe me, everytime you go to Harvest you WILL find something different in the menu (well.. at least if you're a lowly graduate student like me who can't afford to go to Harvest every week).  When you have GOURMET vegetarian food in your menu, that's A-OK in my book.  Actually I LOVE to be able to say I can't recommend something, 'cause most likely by the time you go, it won't be there.  What I do recommend is to check out their website and check for their \"speciality\" days.. They're SO WORTH IT.  Seriously by far the BEST restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great ambiance, professional staff, local ingredients place is the real deal.  My wife and I enjoyed dinner at their outdoor patio while in town for SOAR, the UW freshmen registration program.  Our daughter is in love with the university and having dinner at Harvest put an exclamation mark on the trip; this place is destined to be our go to spot when we visit her."}
{"text":"Food was good, however, we were not given what was pre-selected.  Their service might be good for individuals, but very disappointing for our group private dining.  Group menu was not what was promised (beef, fish, chicken is listed as ALWAYS an option at price point we chose and were charged.), but we were only given chicken and veggie option.  Although wait staff was friendly, they were very stressed and hurried (our group arrived 15 minutes late - and therefore we were not served our first course, soup.)  Felt very unwelcome and though we were somehow bothering them by being there.  Found out through staff that they had a \"bigger and better\" group booked immediately after us - so that might explain the overall poor customer service. Would not recommend for private dining/group arrangements."}
{"text":"I just realized I forgot to write a review after I dined here months ago... so I'm a little fuzzy on the details, e.g. what menu items we ordered, vintage/vintner we drank (I do recall it being a smooth Pinot Noir), etc. Oh well.  The impression of the evening was lasting nevertheless.  I recall the menu being a la carte, and the prices somewhat steep. Those two factors can make for a very hefty bill at the end of the night -- and it did. The food is great, but not world-class great... Harvest is a big fish in a small pond. When compared on an international or even just a national stage, it would be awarded a consolation prize, but certainly no medals.  The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was immaculate... and I'm keeping this review relative to the small pond of Madison, so these factors bump its rating to a solid 4 stars. I'll recommend it, and I may even be back -- just as soon as I check out L'Etoile."}
{"text":"We ate here with a big group, and we were seated in the side room. Felt like we were at a suburban banquet hall instead of a restaurant. The space wasn't artful or interesting and could use some personality. The food was great but the portions were incredibly small. I had the artichoke and finished my meal in about four bites. It was delicious and well-prepared but not worth the $20+ for an entree. I mean, I would thought it was small if I'd ordered it as a side salad! I left feeling hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok you tend to write a review when it's really good or really bad...unfortunately this was very bad...it's my second time here, both times others have chosen it and told me how upscale it is....hmmm...I've eaten in the French Laundry.....this last time at Harvest was indescribably bad. But I'll try and describe anyhow....  First trip I was truly underwhelmed and hoped Madison had better, because we were moving here from Atlanta and because if this is upscale and the best Madison has to offer Madison needs a palate cleansing.   This trip in a party of 10, nearly the only table in the place, the bar restaurant next door was buzzing. It was definitely pretentious which I don't mind if the food is good, but please accurately describe the dishes when asked, fail. And if you aren't going to put salt (rarely at a decent place would I expect salt) on the table at least then season the food; under seasoned. I had the rabbit confit as an app...swimming in oil....my wife had the pork chop, cold and raw in the middle....likewise a friend had the same experience cold and raw....so with one table of 10 in the place you can't deliver 10 consistent properly cooked plates.  My gnocchi was horrible, gritty, who wants gritty gnocchi? Poor texture, maybe someone would like it but the flavor profile was off, like the Atlanta chef/owner on Top Chef  of \"Rosebud\", I've eaten there and yes he did put vanilla on steak...him and the chef at Harvest would probably get along....but they are catering to the 1%...the 1% with off kilter taste buds. Will not be back...oh my cheese cake was \"deconstructed\" which seemed to consist of warm cheese part of the cheesecake swimming in some sort of syrup...awful.   I will not be back...\"Oh you want to go to Harvest again, sorry no can do\"."}
{"text":"After a few incredible fine-dining meals at other restaurants, I had commented to my wife that I was eager to try other fine-dining places.  So, for my birthday, she decided to take me to Harvest.  I was excited to try something new.  Unfortunately, there's no way to describe the meal other than overpriced and extremely underwhelming.  Things got off to a bad start as soon as we were seated.  The hostess put us at a table where my wife had to sit on a long, shared bench running the length of the wall.  This is a fine arrangement for a casual place, but at a more upscale place, I expect some privacy and not to have to share a bench seat with loud people on either side.  Our waitress gave us the menus; I was extremely underwhelmed.  None of the dishes on offer seemed particularly exciting or innovative to me.  We ordered all of our courses at once: small plates to start with and an entree for each of us, plus a cheese plate.  We ordered the cheese at the same time as the rest of our food as directed by the menu.  Then we waited.  And kept waiting.  Eventually, someone brought us our amuse-bouche.  It was described as a cool watermelon soup with fresh-cracked black pepper.  It was actually watermelon juice with what looked like McCormick's-level preground pepper.  We were underwhelmed.  About forty minutes after we first sat down, our small plates came out.   We hadn't even received our table bread at this point.  To be fair, out waitress had apologized and given me a free vodka on the rocks by this point, as well as explained that the kitchen was backed up because of a large party in the other room.   Still, forty minutes seems like way too long to wait.  The dishes themselves were OK.  Our buckwheat ramen was so-so.  The pork pate was reminiscent of cat food.  The French fries with horseradish aioli were good, but how could they not be?  They're French fries.  The foie gras was delicious.  The table bread--which did finally arrive--was also delicious.  Our entrees--which arrived only after another long wait--weren't actively bad, but they were pretty \"meh\" at best.  My wife ordered the gnocchi.  It was OK, but the flavor of bell pepper was overwhelming in the worst way.  I ordered the hanger steak.  I've seen people raving about it on here, which I simply don't understand.  My meat was tender and cooked properly, but it was devoid of flavor.  The entire plate was just bland.  The potato salad was stringy and off-putting, and the braised leeks were just unusual.  We were given dessert options.  By this point we were ready to leave, but it was my birthday, so I figured we should give it a shot.  We ordered two desserts, an empanada and a chocolate cremieux.  The chocolate pudding--that's really all it was--was good.  The empanada was unimpressive.  We never got our cheese plate, and we chose to just get the meal over with rather than say anything about it.  When we got our bill, though, we realized that we'd been charged for the cheese plate.  My wife brought this to the server's attention.  She apologized, corrected our bill, explained that the cheese plate had been prepared, and offered it to us for free.  We declined and left.  So, to sum up, our Harvest experience was so bad that even the offer of free cheese wasn't enough to keep us there.  If you want fine dining in Madison, go to L'Etoile.  It's twice as expensive, but it's four times the experience."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Ordered smoked salmon and my son ordered the pork loin which the waiter said was fork tender. I was expecting fully cooked salmon, but it was more like lox which I really don't care for. My son's pork loin was very dry and definitely not fork tender! The wine was excellent though. Would probably not go back again."}
{"text":"Great food and very well prepared.  Love their motto of come as you are.  Some people are dressy some are in jeans.  If you can sit by the window, you will have one of the best views of the capitol on the square."}
{"text":"Right next to the capitol building, Harvest is right where you want to be when you visit Madison, and the local/organic food does not disappoint.  A diverse crowd of visitors & locals, with a friendly intelligent wait staff, Harvest is a great place for dinner.  My mom and I went on a recent cross country trip and were thrilled with the healthy and uncomplicated menu. I had a spectacular greens salad, made more interesting with fresh herbs, and a sea bass that was to die for.   Great wine list, too, and I am STILL salivating over the chocolate hazelnut flourless cake we had... yum!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, attentive service.  I had the grilled romaine, the scallops, and strawberry basil ice cream.  Everything was beautiful and delicious."}
{"text":"OK - the food is incredible.  All organic.  Most  of the stuff is from local farms.  You can tell that the chef and staff clearly care about what they are serving.  My one cavaet is that when I'm spending this much on a meal, I always feel too much pressure to enjoy it."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy local/sustainable/organic foods, so our best man got us a gift card to Harvest as a wedding gift.  We decided to stop one snowy night after house hunting in Madison and didn't know what to expect.  We felt under dressed in jeans, and we should have made a reservation because it was very busy.  The hostess took our coats and directed us to the bar while we waited.  The bar can really only fit about 2 people, and there isn't really any other good place to wait, so plan ahead if you want to eat here.   I had the most AMAZING cherry martini, and the bartender seemed very knowledgeable about drinks.  She was very helpful with recommending a good red wine for my husband.  The bartender was very friendly and gave us a free sample of another martini on the menu which was also delicious.  The atmosphere here seemed very trendy and upscale.  When we were seated, the waiter brought us small complimentary dishes of potato leek soup (delicious).  After some delicious appetizers, our meals arrived.  My husband had a grass fed beef steak, and I had chicken.  Everything was plated beautifully and full of flavor.  When we opted to skip dessert, the waiter brought us complimentary cookies.  The service here was absolutely amazing.  We felt like royalty.  When my husband got up to use the restroom, the waiter came over and folded his napkin and removed the crumbs from the table.  Our water glasses were never empty.  The waiter was very good at anticipating our needs.  This place is about enjoying good food as well as the experience.  It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion, but it is very pricey.  Our bill was WELL over $100 for the two of us."}
