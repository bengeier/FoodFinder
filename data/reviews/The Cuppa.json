{"text":"After ordering my latte I discovered that I was talking to the owner of the several Cuppa locations here in town. She was very friendly and answered several questions that I had. The Latte was excellent, and the overall experiance was something to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Love the decor and feel, but capp was a bit bitter for my liking. Maybe living in Australia has turned me into a coffee snob!? So hard to find a proper coffee in the States I suppose. I'll definitely be back to try another cuppa though. Friendly service."}
{"text":"4 stars for the coffee,  food is a bit inconsistent.  It is give and take on the food. I was told it depends on who makes it :( . So it's risky to waste your lunch hour."}
{"text":"The location is OK, although nearby parking is scarce.  You can find parking a couple blocks away by the theater.

The problem is pastry isn't well cooked, coffee doesn't taste very good, and the service is exceedingly slow.

On the positive side seating is ample and the shop is air conditioned.

Honestly I think Starbucks and Samba Latte are both much better choices."}
{"text":"Nice little new place!  Coffee is good & a nice change from that big Seattle liberal hangout."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed. 

Went on a slow Tuesday around 1 ish and it wasn't that great. 
The menu in my opinion is confusing and there are no prices listed anywhere for normally coffee stuff. It's also written in chalk and it's a SUPER wide menu so it's hard to see the whole thing. Unless you have \"that drink\" that you order at every coffee shop (you know the one) the menu isn't helpful, it's basically just flavors.

The biggest issue I had is I ordered a pastry with my coffee and it wasn't given to me at the time my coffee came out. So I had to wait around for it. When the barista noticed I was waiting for something  she let me know that she'd grab it in a minute. Meanwhile she kept making other drinks and having a conversation with her customer. Waited about 5-10 minutes to get a pastry handed to me. 

Barista apologized for the wait but ... c'mon. You see me standing around for 5 minutes waiting and instead of taking the 5 seconds to step away from the drinks you're making and grab the pastry out of the glass container.. You instead make me wait 5-10 minutes while you finish all the drinks (that were ordered WAY after I had already been waiting). Just little things like this are frustrating. 

Overall I got the sense that the bar flow and order of how things were made and processed wasn't very efficient but the coffee was good. But, not good enough to deal with everything else. I probably won't return. Waiting so long for a pastry + the awful menu + not *that* great of coffee isn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"Was so excited to go here. It was 10:30am on a Saturday and there was a very loud band playing inside the coffee shop. Who also took up most of the inside tables. It was so loud it was hard to order or hear your name called for your drink or food. I was there with 2 other people who I could not even hold a conversation with. When I asked the girl calling out names who's name she said she didn't even answer me she just said not your's. Uhh ok but I'm with 2 other people as well. She looked at me confused and told me what the sandwich was...not who's but what. Once we finally had all our food and drinks the 3 of us sat at a tiny table outside so we could hear eachother. The coffee was pretty good. Food was alright but definitely not worth the experience."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Cute coffee shop feel. Awesome live music. The place was frankly dirty. The seats and tables clearly needed to be cleaned. With as busy as they were it isn't a surprise. That wouldn't stop me from going back or rating them high however."}
{"text":"Best coffee in town!  I love their iced mocha and my husband loves the iced Mexican spice latte.  They use the small crushed nugget ice (like Sonic) which makes it even better!  I can't wait for it to start getting cool out so I can try their hot mocha, but I already know it will be amazing!  Also they have yummy glazed croissants.  The staff is excellent and they even know our order now."}
{"text":"Love this local coffee shop so much, every time I walk in its so welcoming and friendly, feels like your friend is making you a latte! Not too mention the coffee is so so so good. I look forward too the days when I can make a trip here, literally makes my day!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great location just off 215 (close to my office also). The decor is amazing and the coffee is always perfect. Attentive service and a cool selection of stuff to eat on the menu.  Give them a try you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Decent coffee, nothing spectacular that would make this place my go to stop. No military or veterans discount offered..."}
{"text":"Quiet little coffee shop, just like their other location a great place to read a book or study. The free wifi is a plus. Plenty of seating inside and out on the patio. Perfect place to come for a morning cup of coffee if you aren't looking for the regular buzz at a chain shop. I hope they keep this one around, it's a wonderful shop!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best locally owned coffee shops. It's my first time here and there are probably 15 people inside, it's quiet and has all of the makings of an excellent study spot. The staff greeted me with a smile and took my order within a minute or two (after finishing helping the customer in front of me). Prices are reasonable, I hope to make this a regular study spot this year. Keep up the good work!

Update: Still one of the best places to study, recommend the cold brew. Above rating still holds true."}
{"text":"Las Vegas????????????Las Vegas??????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"A great and much needed addition to Downtown Summerlin! I had an iced caramel latte and it was delicious. The espresso had a great flavor and strong enough not to be drowned out by the sugary caramel. Spacious inside seating with a wide variety of books and plenty of outdoor seating too. If only if had a scrumptious pastry/dessert selection, it would've been 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Really great coffee, pastries, and breakfast English muffin sandwiches! ( I had the ham egg and cheese) loved the decor, optional outside seating and prices are great! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and has a small town coffee shop feel to it. Several people walked in after me and the batista knew their names as well as their orders. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"My girl friend and i. we love this coffee shop, we go there twice a week just to pop in a coffee to go.The space is open and airy,outdoor has nice courtyard for seating. We like just regular coffee Ethiopian or Costa Rica they are always fresh."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... Good coffee

I liked the design of the interior, it was somewhere I could meet business associates or friends.  

It was a step above Starbucks to me."}
{"text":"The iced vanilla Chai was AMAZING! I could stay at this place all day and just relax. Such a great atmosphere and the staff was friendly and very welcoming. Breanna was super helpful in helping us pair a delicious pastry with our coffee. Will be frequenting the Cuppa often for years to come!"}
{"text":"Ok, love this place.  Right in downtown Summerlin.  They open  at 7 on the weekdays and 8 on the weekends.  Plenty of books to read and the staff was very friendly.  Nice decor and excellent drinks.  Prices were spot on.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Love my vanilla Chai tea!! Soo yummy!! The protein pack is perfect for on the go, comparable to the starbucks protein pack (minus peanut butter which makes me sad). So happy this place is close to my new home at the grammercy! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Staff and owner are extremely friendly, Coffee, tea, pastries, smoothies... I can go on and on about how good this place is! 
 
Only problem.... They close too early (5pm on weekdays, and 3pm on weekends)"}
{"text":"I definitely love the layout of this place and the decor is so cute without all the fuss.  It's very contemporary.  Their seating area extends to a nice courtyard outside. I especially like their reading area - a wall of books added a nice touch.  However, as much as I love their decor, it would be nice if they can add more seating that are comfortable, a well-cushioned seat pairs real well with a great book and a cup of cocoa.  I ordered their Mocha Latte and it's just perfect!  It's not overly sweet and I can actually taste the chocolate in it :-)  I had their croissant which I asked to be lightly toasted with a bit of butter and jam, yum!  Their pricing is just average, not really any more than Starbucks but way better.

I'm for sure coming back to try out more of their menu items.  Another plus side is that they're just down the street from me @ the Gramercy's, yay!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Holley did a great job opening this location at the Gramercy. They have a great Iced Latte and Iced Coffee. Personally, I recommend the chicken salad sandwich. The location is small, but comes with a lot of flair. They have a bookcase full of books, a puzzle table. Their menu sits on a chalkboard wall and it's just fun place to be able to sit and have a cup of coffee. They are located near the apartments and right by a gym and nail salon."}
{"text":"A much needed addition to DTS. The Cuppa opens early, (7am on weekdays, 8am and 9am respectively on Sat &Sun) well before any of the businesses open. This, I am sure, is appreciated by DTS employees, and those of us who are looking for a early cup without the crowds.

Holly and her crew make an excellent latte and offer a variety of goodies to enjoy along with your fav bev. There is a comfortable patio as well as plenty of indoor seating. 

******This store has now closed. Snother coffee store is suppise to open here soon. Makers Coffee I believe.

If I had one suggestion, it would be to add umbrellas on the patio. They will ne needed with the warmer summer months coming on."}
{"text":"Cappuccino is worst the dunkin donuts atmosphere is sure really nice but $5 for a burned coffee??? Come on .
I do have a lot of experience and knowledge about coffee and this is cheap beans!"}
{"text":"The Cuppa is a great place to hang out as it's got a cool inside space decorated with a library like atmosphere and then there's the cool kids section outside with outdoor patio furniture in a  courtyard setting.

I have had numerous coffee drinks from lattes to the chai and the only thing consistent here is the cookie I order with it. The drinks are never hot enough or have the right ratio of coffee to skim milk. There is really an art to coffee making and this place does not fit the bill. Everything I've ordered here tastes watered down.

Back to the cookie, they rock it with their Cranberry White Chocolate Health Cookie. It's made with only bananas, oats, cranberries and white chocolate chips. They probably have this to cater to the RAW gym crowd next door but it's worth trying, just order water with it so you don't have to plunk down and waste $6.00 for specialty coffee."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! First time in Vegas and was looking for a coffeehouse, this was was close to where we were staying so we decided to give it a try and I am so glad we did! I had a peppermint latte and it was so smooth and delicious. We went out to the sitting area and it was so pretty and comfy and the weather was perfect for a hot coffee. Today we are leaving and going back to Phoenix, AZ and I had to stop to get another peppermint latte for the road. Till next time Cuppa!"}
{"text":"Free Wi-Fi, free cookie with check-in on Facebook but not Yelp. The location had my Maps all upset but I found it nonetheless. It's sign outside says Coffee House with The Cuppa in the window. 

They offer pastries that are baked in-house. I chose their Jalapeño quiche (5/5 size of my palm with onions, red bell peppers, and dare I say grilled jalapeños, with a fair amount of melted white cheese on top. I asked for it warmed though she didn't give me the option. She microwaved it- I'm more of a toaster oven fan myself to ensure texture and nutrient content), cinnamon roll croissant (twas bomb! I also asked for it warmed. It was microwaved as well but yummy. I loved the filling and texture.), and a small (12oz) Mexican Spice latte (I asked what it tastes like and she said chocolate. I'd compare it more to a pumpkin spice latte? Definitely had some nutmeg/clove action in there. Not my style really but I'd say it was good for what it was). 

Service was friendly and helpful. 

Their patio made me want to have tea and sunbath the cancer all up! Gorgeous! But Vegas has its tendency to be deterringly windy so I stayed inside to study instead. 

I liked that there was a wide variety of seating. You could have an intimate conversation, a group study session, or some solo time. There is a huge book shelf and a table with puzzles and games. I really liked the feel of the place. Some coffee shops lack the cozy factor but this one catered to it. The place was stylish, border line hipster."}
{"text":"Small and easy to find. My cup cost more than other trendy places, but it wasn't as busy and packed. The down part of this review was the inability to add the free wifi service. I almost tried the food, but the server was taking money and making food, so I had to pass. Not sure if I'll try again since there are so many SBs with reliable wifi service."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for coffee- anywhere. My wife is a very picky coffee drinker and the plain old dark roast coffee is her favorite in the world- literally. I'm into more foofoo coffee drinks and they're great too. Great atmosphere. And independent of the big GMO promoting chains. A little gem."}
{"text":"This is the best coffeehouse in town! Wonderful atmosphere and the flavored iced lattes are to die for! I've been here a few times and the lady with the colorful hair is such an asset. She told my friend and I the story about her now blue hair being for blue lives matter and is just so friendly and outgoing.... so refreshing from the Sambalatte baristas who have no personality and just talk coffee like robots."}
{"text":"I love coffee and thought this would be a cool place to check out but it's nothing special. It's just a regular coffee shop in Downtown Summerlin. The coffee was fine but no need for me to comeback."}
{"text":"This a nice whole in the wall that only locals enjoy. I found it when looking for some place new to try. The coffee was good not a bad price and they have pastries that didn't seem old or had been sitting on the shelf too long. I got to sit and enjoy the time and talk to family while enjoying the coffee and pastries. It's a nice quote place to sit and relax or read a book do home work. Nice place overall!!!"}
{"text":"Cuppa is the new Wagyu... Iced Latte was fire and the ambiance is amazeballs. The place just made me feel good, like watching The Flight Of The Navigator as a kid - real good. Price was similar to a roach coach lunch, reasonable. There's a back door that leads to a concrete wonderland of tables and chairs as far as the eye can see with room to spread my wings. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE CUPPA!!! I come here every single morning because I work in the Gramercy and every morning I'm greeted with smiles and laughter and my life saving mocha with an add shot. Better than Starbucks by farrrrr!! I've been coming every morning for almost a year and I look forward to it each time. The staff is amazing, the food is good, and the coffee is just divine. If you're in the neighborhood this is a definite MUST!!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Such a great Quality service and coffee. Everyone is extremely friendly. And coffee taste out of this world! Love the energy of this place."}
{"text":"They recently opened and already this is my favorite location- it's clean and fairly spacious, there's a huge community bookshelf, and patio area. In addition to coffee drinks, menu has a few pastries, bagels, and sandwiches for light bites. Go when you can stay awhile, the dine-in ceramic mugs are enormous and your drink size is practically double!"}
{"text":"What a great location for a coffee shop. The outdoor ambiance really sold me.

As far as the coffee and food, there are room for improvements with their food. I ordered their chicken salad croissant sandwich, and it basically was just canned chicken with hardly any mayo, no seasonings, and no other add ons. The cashier told me it's one of their most popular items, which is surprising.

I'll be back, but only for the coffee, I'll pass on the food."}
{"text":"Not bad. The view out the windows is one of the better coffee house views in the city, looking out over Red Rock, which probably glows red every sunset and sunrise. Seating has comfortable options, with cushy chairs and a well-loved sofa, along with standard small chairs/table combos. 

My pour over coffee tasted fine. Served in a take-out cup, though, it had that hint of paper taste and was just unremarkable otherwise. The English muffin sausage/egg/cheese breakfast plate was altogether meh. Egg texture looked like that made from those industrial bags of pre-mixed egg used in fast-food joints. Healthy, but tasteless, one step up from an egg mcmuffin. 

Each coffee house in the Valley attracts a certain customer type. The Cuppa, like Sambalatte west, seems to attract a steady stream of moms-with-babies. If that's you, have at it, and enjoy these spots. If that's *not* your cup of tea, if you can't stand wailing babbling b.s. and interjecting shrieks and high-pitched coo'ing at infants, the smell of diapers mixed with your food and drink, then maybe look elsewhere for your morning and afternoon brews. 

Otherwise, probably a reliable cup that's priced right: just below the average Starbucks' cost."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from here, and I love this place. I love that they have coconut flavored syrup for lattes, and their flavored croissants are amazing (they have one that is like baklava and another one that is cinnamon roll flavored). Their coffee is genuinely good, and their staff is really nice. I also like that they have healthy options. The location is quiet, and the price point is average for an espresso shop. A con is that the wifi is kind of slow. 

I wish they'd start a rewards program of some sort."}
{"text":"Walked in and everyone is on their Mac. Went to the counter cashier didn't greet us, not very engaging. The person from the back came out to answer our questions about the menu, more helpful. The cashier still managed to get one of our orders wrong but I think it was because it didn't look like she wanted to be there. I believe if you're a small coffee house customer service and friendliness is crucial for your new customers to come back. Anyway ambience is casual and relaxed, food is ok had the ciabatta turkey burger, iced chai tea is better than Starbucks but not better than Coffee Bean."}
{"text":"Great location, space is nice. First time I came here I got an iced hazelnut macchiato which was great. Refreshing and also free because their ipad wasnt working. I had no cash and the cashier was really nice about it. 5 stars for that. But I came again and got an iced vanilla chai latte which was ok and a chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was 2.50 but very big and delicious...BUT there was a short blonde hair on it. Almost like a dogs hair....I have long black hair and no pets :/ overall their menu selection is very small and a bit overpriced. Also when I came in I noticed the cashier was eating something and licked his fingers and didnt wash them. I dont think he touched anything I ate, but still..."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, as I work really close. Downtown Summerlin is really expensive, but this place is an inexpensive must if you're looking for a cup of coffee or bagel/pastry for your morning meal! I work inside the one random office building in the Downtown Summerlin Mall and appreciate a place like Cuppa for the simple fact that eating out in the mall gets pricey...I'm talking $20+ for a freaking sandwich and some chips! 

We need more places like Cuppa in this area. Tasty and not too much of a strain on the old pocket book!"}
{"text":"Based off of all the other reviews extolling the drinks here, I was super excited to try The Cuppa out. In particular, I saw a post about how someone would come study here often. LEGIT COFFEE AND A STUDY SPOT? It's too good to be true. Seriously.

I came here on a Saturday morning a little bit before 9am. The Cuppa at DTS is NOT a good study spot. There is way too much foot traffic; music is louder than the music I'm playing through my earphones; I couldn't find any outlets. They have ample seating as most people seem to be grabbing their drinks and going. The crowd definitely grows and gets progressively louder. They have wifi, so I guess that's nice. But if you want serious studying done, this is not the place.

Coffee wise, I really enjoyed my drink. I got the lavender flavored latte in medium. You could get floral hints throughout your coffee, but the star was still the coffee flavor which was great. Even though I came an hour after opening, the pastry selection on display was really meager. 

All in all, I loved my drink. I will drop by whenever I'm shopping at DTS, but I'm never studying here ever again.

*edit their wifi is spotty"}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops for lattes in Las Vegas. Quick, friendly service and delicious drinks. Order the sugar free hazelnut with nonfat, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great place! From the staff to the tables and all the drinks in between. Love dropping in to this place for a pick me up."}
{"text":"This was my second time going here and my experience was day and night compared to my first. The first time I stopped by, the owner was running the shop on her own. She did an excellent job of managing my experience as a customer, although she was very busy. Today I was hoping to chat with the owner but there were employees running the shop. One of them (big earrings) was very bright and positive but the other employee seemed like she wasn't having a good day. Before ordering, I asked, \"what's the most popular?\" She looked at me and didn't respond, so I asked again and she mumbled out words I couldn't understand so I just moved on. I decided to order a latte and oatmeal. After, receiving my coffee, I waiting about 15 minutes. I then asked how much longer for my oatmeal, and the employee said she forgot to make my oatmeal because they were really busy. There were only 2 customers in the store. I usually don't go out of my way to write a negative review but as an employee of a small coffee shop that's competing with giants like Starbucks, customer service is all you have. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Nice quick place if you just want something to drink in the morning or a place to study. 

The coffees and the drinks are pretty average. Just the regular premade syrups and powders you might get elsewhere. Not really any precision in what they are making for their drinks. The food options are pretty limited and not super appealing or attractive. Should consider revamping or adding more daily fresh baked goods for breakfast. 

The staff is super rude and not very friendly, especially if they don't know you or friends with them already. Staff looks uninterested and gives you strange looks if you order something not normal. They also just expect you to come grab your drinks and don't even say that it's ready or call out your name. Space is decently nice though but can get loud if you want to do some work."}
{"text":"A great tiny little coffee shop close to a lot of businesses. Very cute vibe and really good quiche. However, the coffee is not AMAZING and often times, every table is taken by these strange sales people, interviewers making the \"cute vibe\" a little loud and uncomfortable. Kind of disappointing. 

However, it's a great little spot to grab a specialty drink to-go. Like I said, the coffee isn't amazing, it's a little bitter and semi-watery. Not the best I've had in the city. I also tried the chai tea latte and it was VERY sweet. Not a good balance of spice, milk, and sweetness. However if you are avoiding giving Starbucks your business this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I'm really sad I discovered this cute little place as I was leaving Las Vegas. The service, coffee and atmosphere are all top notch. The breakfast sandwiches are huge! And the wifi is strong. 

I recommend getting the iced jungle tea which is black and green tea mixed!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop! Love the ambience and everything I have tried is so yummy! The blueberry muffins are my favorite and the lattes are delicious. Check it out at the Gramercy, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the newest location and it is just as great as the others! I love the interior and there is a great patio as well with tons of seating. The staff is just as friendly as the the other locations. Definitely must visit when you are in downtown summerlin!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely great to come in and hang out and grab a great beverage whether it is cold brew or an iced vanilla chai. Everyone is so friendly at all times of day regardless of who the customer is. My only issue with The Cuppa is that I don't like a ton of ice in my iced drinks and even when I ask for light ice, I get the standard amount of ice. Maybe it is the barista in me, but a lot of ice really alters the quality of an otherwise delicious beverage for me."}
{"text":"I had no idea there was a coffee shop in the Grammercy building! Stumbled on this spot by accident and the name immediately made me think of Holley's other location. Seems this spot is closer to me, and has a slightly better vibe: limited but affordable food menu, 90s alt hits playing, and that great patio seating! 

Though most people stop in for coffee, I came for tea and was pleased to see a solid selection of quality brands as well as some special loose leaf blends- the Jungle was a berry-infused green-black blend that I enjoyed. Had a Turkey Fusion Burger for a light lunch (turkey patty, lettuce, spicy mayo, and roasted red peppers on ciabatta, $7), and got some work done.

I like what they're selling but the space needs some attention to detail: torn seating and couches, a broken bench supported by a stack of books, no honey at the drink station despite the focus on teas? Just odd, a little too casual."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the Starbucks cookie cut fast, commercial, loud, get in and out coffee shops. I am a fan of the small locally owned coffee shops. The cafes that are cozy not too loud and where the locals go. Cuppa is that locally owned, not super busy, not loud and overly busy. Coffee is good, free and fast internet. But is has a small selection of eats so gets a 4 star."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for studying or reading a book. Very Quiet and they play jazz and bosanova musics also theres book shelf on the side with christmas tree and that side is my favorite! But honestly,Coffee tastes are  nothing special"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! The employees are very friendly and helpful. The vanilla chai tea is the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere! Great coffee, nice decoration! My favorite place to drink coffee spent time to read a book. Hope they can open until lil bit late."}
{"text":"A great place to relax and do some reading or studying. The menu is simple, yet satisfying. But it's the atmosphere that keeps me coming back. A friendly vibe and artsy feel make this place worth the drive from the northwest side of town"}
{"text":"Love the environment. It's a nice place to work or hang out with friend. Coffee is okay! Staffs are very nice."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice vanilla chai latte at the cuppa! Very nice ambience and decor. Very friendly owner. Will be back so"}
{"text":"I really want to see this place succeed so that is why I take the time to write this post. Please hire people that understand customer service. I absolutely despise being called \"bro\" and \"dude\" and \"yeah man\" when ordering my meal. I enjoyed my previous visits when Holly helped me but her employees really need to understand that a customer is exactly that...a customer. Not your buddy or friend. The food and drinks are a 4 star but the service is a 2 star."}
{"text":"The staff are really friendly and I can tell that they really care about making great drinks & foodstuffs and work hard to keep their store clean and their products delicious. They also remember my name and my usual orders. The Cuppa also has a nice little library where you can hang out and read books -- they also have puzzles. It's a wonderful coffee house."}
{"text":"Love this little place! Awesome drinks and very friendly staff. It's not too loud and the drinks are really tasty! I'm also a fan of the glazed croissant!"}
{"text":"Right down the street from me. Love the women who work here. Always friendly and say good morning to you. Its refreshing since Vegas hasn't gave me the best vibe since I've moved here."}
{"text":"I keep passing by The Cuppa on my visits to one of my favorite taco stops Pinches Tacos. The Cuppa is also located in the Gramercy Plaza. So again one of those spots need to know where your going or easy get lost. Just make sure driving off Russell turn into Gramercy and as you come around the corner you will find The Cuppa. 

One day decided change up my coffee/reading spot try something new. The yelp pictures definitely looks like cafe that has some personality. So figure The Cuppa would be the perfect spot to write a new review plus always try my best to hit new spot once week. Yelp!!! The pictures no doubt give the place justice comes to personality. The only other coffee shop that comes close would be Grouchy. The difference between the two is The Cuppa way way more modern, adult oriented, and lot ways more sophisticated. The interior from the book shelves, the type of books that anyone can grab and leisurely read, the leather couches, or one wall that hangs picture frames of great quotes from random people. One table that just for puzzles (more community puzzle; everyone helps build it if sit in that are or another spot to chill at), and the book area awesome area just chill read over great coffee. The natural sunlight comes in on that side of the cafe is perfect. In the back of the cafe open patio area that on warmer days great spot chill. Once it does get warm count me in!!

The coffee truth not much coffee expert. I just like my mochas. The white mocha is solid. Me more about relaxing, chill, and great atmosphere read my book detox from reality along with good mocha. The Cuppa no doubt offers all the best things I look for in my coffee shop/cafe. 

The service was excellent. I believe Holly was the one making the drinks. It was delicious. She was friendly. All smiles and positive vibes. Got too love."}
{"text":"I've visited here a few times. Nice cute place to relax by yourself or chat with your friends. 
But always takes long time to get my coffee and taste just okay. 
But they have nice patio to relax with dogs :)"}
{"text":"I was in a rush so I was not able to get any pictures. Definitely will be back! I ordered the green tea latte and roasted pepper turkey wrap it was very good.  Staff was very friendly, and it was very clean."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this hidden gem. I believe they just expanded to DTS. Fresh food and awesome hot mochas."}
{"text":"Great Coffee, good kids drinks also. Great place to hang out and take a break while shopping at DTS."}
{"text":"very friendly staff. tasty turkey fusion burger. for a 'coffee bar' though I prefer drinks in mugs rather than disposable paper cups, unless of course you are taking your coffee to go, which I specified I was not. other wise cool spot."}
{"text":"Completely and utterly satisfying. I got a chai latte with lavender and bulletproof-beyond my expectations. Great ambiance and spacious."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was the amazing ambience. Very quiet compared to other cafes which makes studying even better! However they do close pretty early (5/6 PM). The drinks are nice. Not great, just nice. The first time I came here, I got the lavender latte. The lavender was  very subtle and the drink was a bit too sweet for my preference. Today I got a matcha latte and it was just perfect! It wasn't an overbearing matcha flavor compared to other cafes!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Coffee is delicious and the jalapeño cheddar bagel is out of this world! Staff is friendly and it has a great atmosphere!! Will continue to come here."}
{"text":"So good! I'm super picky about coffee and this is the jam. They've got a large selection to choose from, but I usually stick with an iced latte or an iced vanilla chai latte. They have that really good crushed ice too ;) 

You can get pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and even little snacks like hummus and pita, turkey wraps, and salads. There is plenty of seating with cozy benches with puzzles, books, high tables, and it opens up onto a back patio with cushions and twinkle lights. Love it so much!!!!"}
{"text":"CUTE SHOP AND AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE. They even have a good solid selection of books to read. Our group of three got an ice hazelnut latte with soy milk, ice vanilla with coconut latte, and ice black coffee. I'm my opinion, the hazelnut one was creamy and yummy but it didn't stand out from any other coffee shops. The vanilla drink was just plain weird to my tastebuds. The third drink was not as bitter as most authentic black coffee like from Blue Bottle but still a great refresher on a hot day like today."}
{"text":"Great service, good variety of products, nice ambiance!!!  I would certainly return!!!"}
{"text":"Your friendly neighborhood coffee shop is worth making the time for.  Sure, it doesn't have a drive thru, which would require you to park and come into the space, but that is the point of this hip, trendy joint.  You just feel good when you come in for coffee and stay awhile.

I must admit that I'm an iced coffee fiend, and they deliver without fail.  I'm always greeted with a smile and feel welcomed into the space.  They have a pretty extensive selection of accoutrements for your coffee, so no matter your sweetener or cream--you will be fine.  The menu offers limited food and pastries, but they can do most anything in regards to your caffeine (or non-caffeine fix) in the form of coffees, teas, cappuccinos, cappuccinos, and espresso.

I had planned on dashing in and out, but I found myself transfixed by the wall of books and soon found myself reading a short passage from a classic I haven't picked up in a while.  This must be the thing to do, for as I was leaving, I noticed I wasn't the only one who had picked up a book, and there was even a group quietly putting together a puzzle and sipping their brews.

Also, I didn't find this out right away, but on other visits I discovered a huge patio with tons of seating.  Perfect for morning work or afternoon breaks and meet-ups when it isn't 100 degrees in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I drink only decaf. They don't make decaf in pots, so they made me a fresh brew! It was great! The atmosphere is very Seattle and the staff very friendly!"}
{"text":"A friend wanted to meet so I found this cute and cozy coffee house on Yelp. We ordered inside and sat outside on the patio since it was a beautiful day in DTS. My friend and I were so engrossed in our conversation that we forgot about going back inside to get our coffee but a very sweet employee brought it out to us. Nice!

I loved the outdoor seating which offers a variety of seating arrangements including small sofas. My soy vanilla latte was perfect and I loved the large ceramic mug it was served in.

Again, my friend and I were so engrossed in our conversation that I did not notice a bug had flown into my drink. When the same employee came out to collect our mugs and to see how we were doing, she offered a complimentary drip coffee to replace it. Very nice!!

I guarantee I will be back...and soon!"}
{"text":"After trying numerous coffee spots around the Las Vegas Valley, this by far has been our favorite coffee spot. Every Sunday morning, we wake up and go on our coffee date and it ALWAYS is to The Cuppa (or it's sister shop, Holly's Cuppa). We are always greeted, fast service and AMAZING coffee. Our favorites are Hot Mocha with Coconut and Hot Mexican Blend. We love the atmosphere and the vibes of the shop and the employees. This will remain our Sunday ritual... thanks Cuppa!"}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop. The employees are fun and energetic. Guy with the long blonde hair helped me pick out a drink, super friendly! Definitely would recommend the chai tea latte! Prices are pretty low too, will be returning."}
{"text":"i've only gone here once and just got one item off the menu (hazelnut frappe i think), but i already really love this coffee shop. the area around is already super cute and calm. the shop itself has a really nice homey feel to it. the workers here were really nice to my friends and i. we decided on stopping by here since it was recommended to us by a few friends, and now i can see why. the frappe was great and i may have enjoyed it more than any starbucks drink i've had. definitely plan on coming here more often !!"}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee and a very convenient stop before getting onto the 215 for work in the morning. Lots of space to sit down including a real nice patio area."}
{"text":"I love the Cuppa! Finally one near my house and it's open later than all the other Cuppas. It's located near lush in Downtown Summerlin. The interior is spacious and there is lots of seating. I do wish they had more outlets, but there are a few scattered around. They also have a large patio with comfy seating. 

The service is impeccable. Everyone is super friendly and familiar with the menu. They offer different kinds of milks and syrups as well. They also offer a lot of really great teas! I had one of the baristas create an earl grey tea latte that was out of this world. Their matcha green tea latte is NOT vegan. I was misinformed from an employee who thought it was just a matcha powder. It in fact is not. 

This place is convenient to study at... and another huge perk is it's located near tru fusion! Coffee and yoga anyone?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere and amazing customer service. Charlie, Ozzy and Holly are always upbeat and welcoming! I highly recommend going to this coffee shop!"}
{"text":"This place has great coffee! Good location and a nice place to hang out, especially the seating area outside on a nice day. Service however is slow, not because whoever is working is slow but because they're so popular and have enough business that it demolishes the one barista that is working. They're always pleasant and gracious and are always obviously hustling and working as quick as they can but the menu is too large for one person to even handle 5 drinks in a row without getting weeded. Now that the place is picking up I hope to see more faces working there. I love coming here for coffee but definitely not somewhere to come and grab a quick cup! 

With that said, this place is a gem! Super friendly accommodating staff and consistently great coffee (chais are great here). Also try the croissant with cinnamon crumble, so unique and delicious. Also free wifi!"}
{"text":"If you like intimate local coffee shops then you will love Cuppa. Quiet and tucked into a not yet busy center, this one is easy to overlook. Once you step in though you are immersed in wonderful aromas and a warm atmosphere.

Personally I prefer independent coffee shops. Just the old school capitalist in me but I feel like I'm sticking it in a Starbucks eye. Really though, the coffee here is better and more affordable so why wouldn't I come in?

Love the wall of books as well. Let's me know I'm welcome to stay a while and relax. That being said, the furniture is busted! Come on guys how can I relax on a couch that is trying to swallow me?"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the workers there! They are so sweet and nice! 
You have to TRY OUT there MOCHA FRAPP!! 
So GOOD! Keep it UP!"}
{"text":"I'm learning how this goes.  Group of elites get together for a UYE whether posted or not.  Then there's a post UYE meet up, followed by another post UYE of a skeleton crew hahaaa.  And on that day, this skeleton crew ended up at the Cuppa.

They're new to DT Summerlin.  They took over the Asian restaurant that used to be here.  Anyway... you get aroma therapy upon walking in cuz LUSH is next door.  Then you get inspirational messages entering the doorway.  Read 'em all!  On top of that a caffeine fix and relaxing lounge time.  Or if you want they even have Italian cream soda!  

Meet new friends (aloha guys), chat up with friends, discover their interests, spend time like you've got a ton of it!  You might like the 'library' area.  I like how they've set up.  And thanks to the hard working boy who blended all our drinks.  

Have a cuppa smiles while you're at it."}
{"text":"The matcha isnt as good as others and the vibe I got wasn't cozy or trendy, I'd rather go to madhouse coffee. I think I'll give it another try but not my favorite spot..."}
{"text":"I found my new coffee spot!!! Love this place. The staff is wonderful. My caramel latte is yummy!! Finally someone made it right... Love the ambiance..."}
{"text":"I'm a digital nomad, currently living in LV. Cuppa has become my go-to spot for working on my MacBook. It's cozy, quiet, and has good coffee. The staff is super friendly and fast. It's like always getting served by the A-Team. I recommend!"}
{"text":"i love this place! i love its cleanliness, friendliness, and consciousness. First, they understand how to make bulletproof coffee for me. The dense flavor and richness and quality is well in there on your first sip. I came here with my Aunt, and it being situated in Downtown Summerlin, is a win. :) Will probably work here, read here, hangout here in the very near future."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quaint and cozy hallway type of layout. Made fresh daily pastries (some not all), and books to unwind to. As a first-time patron I was referred to try their chai latte which warmed my palate and served as a stepping stone for my next visit."}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately noticed a dog. I love pet friendly places. Their menu is simple. It's nice to see a coffee place right in the middle of downtown summerlin. I ordered a glaze croissant and a iced matcha. The glaze croissant was yummy and the matcha didn't have a strong green tea taste. I will come back and try something different."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. I work from home, so when I get a bit stir crazy and need to work elsewhere I come here. They have a great house blend and I always get the pb&j croissant - so yummy. Wifi is free but you may not always get a table that's close to a wall with an outlet. Great service with very friendly baristas."}
{"text":"The place is nice, a cool hip coffee place look. Plus the staff is nice and cool, unlike other coffee places. Anyways the thing that matters is the drinks, they are flavorful and unique. I've been here a couple of times and had a different drink each time and they've never stopped disappointing me!"}
{"text":"My buddy had been telling me forever that Holley's Cuppa out on Cimarron had the best coffee in town, and while I believed him, the place was just nowhere near my commute.

Mercifully, the new location at Grammercy is right near my house, and I have thanked my friend for several times now for recommending it. It seriously is the best. I had been a Starbucks/Coffee Bean guy for over 15 years, and I have honestly not been back to either in over six months. Great brew, great service, good music. If I come here any more often they might charge me rent or something.

Also, the actual shop is beautiful, rustic-modern and a really nice place to chill. A lot of the furniture is made from up-cycled pallets, which is totally up my alley. If you're anywhere near the southwest area of town, you can beat this place."}
{"text":"Ordered a large iced vanilla honey latte (not on the menu) and it was sooo good. The guy working there was nice enough to make me a drink that wasn't on the menu so I was a happy gal! The coffee was strong and had the perfect amount of sweetness. 

It's super cute and spacious on the inside. Love this place, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Cuppa is definitely a nice addition to Downtown Summerlin. There's tables and chairs inside as well out on the patio. Inside was clean and they have a bookshelf and some games that you can help yourself to during your stay. I ordered an Iced White Mocha with caramel drizzle, which was about $5, and it was pretty tasty. I'd order that drink again, but want to try some of the other drinks on their menu. For food they offer oatmeal, pastries and breakfast sandwiches all of which are reasonably priced. Staff is friendly and checked on my table a couple times to see if I needed anything. One huge plus is that the patio outside is dog friendly. The Cuppa is a great place to stop by and chill or grab a drink to enjoy while walking around DTS."}
{"text":"This is a terrific little spot in downtown Summerlin, somewhat close to the movie theater. It is a coffee shop that I think Frasier and Niles Crane would frequent and become regulars there. The coffee is quite robust and rich. The tea is suitably exotic. The space is well-organized, clean, and sparse. There is a wall of quotations that is terribly inspiring, everything from loving coffee to madness. The other wall is under-decorated, but it does have a wonderful vintage sign that says, \"Hand over the coffee and no one gets hurt.\" I like that. You will like this place, too. The bookcase lends this place an air of sophistication that you usually only find in serious cities that have buildings dating earlier than the 1970's. Price is a bit extravagant for coffee, but you expect that in downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I was in the area and stumbled upon this hidden gem. I was immediately greeted by a barista clad in Michigan State gear which intrigued me further as I am from Michigan. As I ordered, the barista named Sarah chatted me up, she was fantastic, energetic, and didn't get frustrated when I changed my order in the middle of her working. 

Sarah's professionalism and overall attitude is what brings people back. Great job and pretty darn good drink as well."}
{"text":"Really cute atmosphere and excellent food! Million times better than Starbucks, truly. I go to Starbucks about 5 times a week. Wish this place has longer hours. You must try their vanilla almond bread... It's Devine! Got it once and thought about it for a straight week until I went back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Coffee Shop in the Southwest. Delicious coffee. Great snacks. Staff is super nice. Owner Holly is amazing.  Great service and cool coffee shop with a book shelf in back. Cool place to just hang out and enjoy a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"BEST Chai Latte I have EVER had! Cute shop, friendly service & yummy food! Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love that there is another coffee option rather than Starbucks. The breakfasts here are amazing and the coffee tastes amazing too. I also love that this cafe is open early so that there is a place to visit with my girlfriends before the shops open. Looking forward to spending many summer mornings here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. I really try to frequent local places for coffee.  It has an outside area. I have been here several times, the same barista is always working, she has glasses, long hair, ear disks, I don't know her name but she's always very friendly. I usually get the vanilla Chai latte from this place, yesterday I got an iced vanilla latte it was very good. They also have, oh my god, I can't tell you how much I love croissants.  This place has glazed ones. I don't know if they make them or order them from a bakery...but are so good. Glazed croissants. They have outdoor seating.  It's near DW Bistro.  Lots of books, different kinds of seating, I like the variety, they need to do something about that tired futon, it's ripped, the springs and foam are coming out and it's really not an appealing thing to see when you first walk in. Let it go to Couch Heaven and get a new one, seriously it's an eyesore. I wish the hours were longer.  They close at 5pm weekdays and 4 pm on weekends.  I spent a little over $10.00 not including tip on my drink and croissant I feel that is reasonable."}
{"text":"I had a Iced nonfat sugar free white chocolate latte and it was great! My husband had a cold brew which was also tasty. They said they steep it for 24 hours which is much appreciated! The glazed croissants also looked really yummy... maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop so much. I regularly go there for lunch for a jungle tea and breakfast wrap. It's an awesome place for reading and they have a bunch of books for borrowing. Everyone is so nice who works there. You'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Hey Vegas! Corporate coffee are for suits and individuals who settle for the mundane. Fortunately, The Cuppa has come along to help elevate this city's game and in the process, has shat all over the status quo.  A year after their grand opening, this place is... what do the kids say nowadays? OFF THE HOOK? Nah.. That's probably the 90's calling. Anyhow, keep reading.

Been here a few times, mainly on the weekends and I have to say, that if I could order everything on the menu, I would. Unfortunately, dietary restrictions preclude me from doing so, therefore, seek out other reviews on the expansive menu, which includes your traditional coffees and teas paired with baked delights and sandwiches. Instead, I want to concentrate on everything else that makes The Cuppa just right for this part of town; an area that has been parched for some time and in desperate need of a good watering hole.

The baristas here are probably the nicest people you'll meet. Helpful and unassuming, which is always refreshing, just like their iced lattes. Speaking of which, the freshness of their espresso really stands out. Too many places seem to drown out the espresso shots with milk. Not here. Perfect balance between the two, which leaves me smiling after every cold sip on a 110F summer day.

If you want to conduct some work here, realize that the elongated layout of the store with its high ceilings can cause a momentary cackle/bellow from a nearby group to reverberate among the music being played overhead, so come packing with a set of headphones. The WiFi is password protected, so ask kindly and don't hog up the bandwidth by streaming HD video, BRO. 

The parking situation is a bit sketchy to me, but if you steer clear of any curbside marked \"Resident,\" you should be fine if you intend on staying for more than an hour. Not entirely sure when The Gramercy will officially be bustling with business, but given the infancy and revival from the defunct Manhattan West project pre-great recession, it looks a ways off. 

Outside, in the courtyard, which might be considered the back entrance, you'll find ample seating that is amenable for social gatherings. Would be a perfect place to hang out during a Vegas autumn evening, while consuming hot drinks and snacks from The Cuppa, of course.

Finally, the interior is immaculate. Love the subtle lighting and abundant seating. Overall, it's a clever design with two opposing entrances and the bar/kitchen right in the middle. A bookshelf stock full of good reads and a few games as well. Restrooms are clean, with zero sh*t tickets left behind on the floor by obnoxious patrons. Bueno.

There aren't very many coffee shops in Vegas that have the ambiance provided by The Cuppa. If you're looking for that hip, LA coffeehouse vibe with Edison Lights and decorative wall art, minus the douchey pretentiousness found at LA coffeehouses, then consider The Cuppa home, but please, whatever you do, don't be a squatter."}
{"text":"I live across the street from Holly's first \"Cuppa\", so was curious to see the Gramercy-spin she'd put on her newest caffeine-infused castle.  It's spacious, sophisticated, comfortable and fantastic.    
With free Wi-Fi, INCREDIBLE food and baked goods to go along with her signature drinks, it's really as good as a coffee house gets in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What a cute place! The patio is absolutely awesome. It's huge and pretty! 

We just popped in for a coffee to go. I had a coconut latte. It was yummy. Hubby just wanted regular coffee. They do not have brewed coffee - you choose your beans and they do a pour over. This is nice for a fresh cup but does take a few minutes. 

We didn't try any of their food but will certainly return soon for grub and coffee on the patio!"}
{"text":"Came by here after searching for a good study/work spot in the SW area.

My overall impression? Meh. 

The area is absolutely gorgeous. I've never been to that business complex, and boy was I impressed with the outdoor area. But this isn't a review for the Gramercy. 

The service at this place  is the reason why I decided to give them a lower rating. It was my first time there, and the baristas behind the counter were very unfriendly. Almost seemed impatient when I wanted a moment to look over the menu. Most small places like this would want to help their new guests out but I guess these guys couldn't be bothered. I agree with many reviews here where it seems they are only friendly to those who they know. 

I ordered a regular iced latte. It was pretty good. 

The cafe itself is very charming. They have a great bookshelf towards the back of the cafe which gives the place a really nice homey feel. 

I chose a table in the back not thinking the sun would be too much of a bother. There's not many outlets around either so I needed the table that was right next to the windows. Biggest mistake. There are no shades or window coverings so the sun was beating down on me, making me uncomfortably warm. 

Would I come back? No. A shame. I really loved the feel and atmosphere of this place. But customer service is a big deal to me and sadly this place lacked that."}
{"text":"I go there once a week ,sometimes two time a week :) I love this coffee shop to just relax my day off. Usually if you go there around 7am nobody  here. I always order  hot coffee,always taste great ! But iced coffee was disappointed maybe it was not fresh ... Also pastries were so so too :(. I need to try bagel but I always wanna have sweet with my coffee . Last Sunday I went there again to get hot coffee ,  It took 10 min to get my coffee ... She was by her self. If you don't have time just go Starbucks:) cheaper too !!"}
{"text":"The cold brew that I had here was probably one of the best I've ever had. It's also a very nice place to sit down with a book or meet a friend"}
{"text":"First time here. Love it. Very chill. Fast wifi, great atmosphere...great place for work and pleasure. My new coffee spot"}
{"text":"Always looking for any coffee outlet other than Starbucks of a chain, I was excited to run across The Cuppa today in the up and coming Grammercy park at Russell and I-215 on the west side of town.

Super easy to reach getting on or getting off the highway, I loved this place.  I am only a boring coffee drinker, but I drink a lot of it throughout the day.  The coffee is solid and great quality.  Good beans and hand brewed.  

The space is open, airy, outdoor seating options (although not a lot of shade out there at this point, but would be lovely on a cooler day and with the right kind of shade from the building) and inviting.  A bit on the quite side because of its newness, which makes it the perfect place at any time of day for a great cup of coffee and a good book.  

I was only drinking coffee, but they do have breakfast foods and lunch items as well that I could see from their menu board.  The ladies behind the counter were super friendly and cute.  

I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Good spot to have a quiet cup of coffee. Really nice space, and nice employees. Has a great looking courtyard in the back as well. I just order regular coffee and not the ice cream topping coffee so that's all i can comment on and it was average. Check this spot out if you live close and or are looking for a place to do work or study."}
{"text":"Great food for breakfast and I love sitting on the patio early in the morning. Food is fresh and hot. My turkey sausage egg and cheddar was hot from start to finish. Thats how you know somethings made right and made fresh."}
{"text":"This is the third location for Holly! Super excited for this in Downtown Summerlin! I went over the weekend and spent almost three hours on the patio. The drinks and desserts were delicious, as always. Staff was super friendly and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Across the street from me. Great parking. Awesome atmosphere. Outdoor area is open. Food tasted delicious"}
{"text":"It's cool place to study. Not much variety. Just your basic cafe. Nice decor. Probably wouldn't come back. Nothing really interest me to come here again. But if you are looking for some quite time and a place to study. This is your cuppa coffee"}
{"text":"By far one of the best coffee shops in vegas. I love that you can come in and study, grab a snack, and enjoy a cup of coffee or a smoothie."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I tried the Mexican Spice Ice Blended drink and it was like melted chocolate in my mouth! Also, great environment for getting out of the heat! Thank you, Cuppa !"}
{"text":"I really liked this shop. Dark and cozy, but with a reading nook with natural light and a variety of books to choose from. Good selection of drinks and flavors. I got the hazelnut latte.It was good... not bitter. Would go again if I was on this side of town. Really friendly employees and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the last straw. It has been hit and miss with this place. Seems to have a high turnover. But yesterday I ordered my usual and the assistant manager was taking orders and handling money, she did NOT wash her hands and was making drinks and handling food. Then she added ice to my drink and then added ice to her personal drink and was drinking her drink over my drink, my drink was not covered. Pretty sure that is against health standards? I'm done."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, but the drinks are still disappointing. With the variety of drinks, you would think the chance of me enjoying a drink the second time would have improved. 

My first time, I had an iced lavender latte. I barely tasted the lavender. This time, I ordered an iced matcha tea latte. It is too sweet, and I can barely taste the matcha. It actually tastes like sweetened milk. Not worth the almost $5 I paid for.

I love the interior. When it's not busy, I really enjoy doing some work since it's quite peaceful, and the music is at the perfect volume.

I probably will come here again just for the environment, but I'll stick to a regular coffee. The Cuppa's fancy drinks are not worth their price."}
{"text":"Spacious, clean & cool inside, inviting patio outside. 

Nice, smiley and helpful staff. Good chillin' 60s music. Framed quotes would be better if not misspelled. Good number of wheelchair accessible tables, but no plugs in sight to recharge. Breakfast sandwiches available at $5 or less. 

Monkey do:

MEXICAN SPICE ICED LATTE- sweet, cold, creamy caffeine. 

Books and four soft chairs to enjoy if you have the time to devour. It's s decent place to break from or wait for your shopper. I had hoped to plug in and yelp more, but no power. Monkey shall return with full charge or battery."}
{"text":"I've visited The Cuppa a total of 4 times and all of them were pleasant. It's nice to have another option other than Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts that's right in front of my house. I've only been here when they opened on weekdays (7 a.m.) due to final exams, but have stayed until DTS actually opened (10 a.m.) so my review is based off of that time period. It's an awesome place to go for coffee or to study. I've only had their regular coffee (both iced and hot) during all my visits and they tasted fine. I'm not picky when it comes to coffee nor am I particular in how it tastes so coffee is coffee to me. Basically the coffee doesn't taste burnt which is a good for me. They have their own private wifi and an option to sit outside. Unfortunately they don't have a lot of outlets that I've seen so far so it'll be harder to charge your electronic device. One of my favorite things is that there's parallel parking spots right in front of the coffee shop so it saves some walking. It's basically dead at 7 a.m., but once it hits 9 a.m., that's when it starts picking up. I've only tried one food item on their menu and it was their jalapeño cheese bagel. Honestly I prefer the 59¢ ones over at Smiths. A good amount of cream cheese comes with the bagel which is awesome, but the bagel itself was not only dry, but crumbly. Not a big deal, just wouldn't order it again. The music noise level was at a medium so it might be bothersome to people that are sensitive to noises, but it wasn't a big deal for me since I did have my own headphones. The staff has always been kind and attentive. Never had an issue, never made me feel uncomfortable, and they've always had a smile on their face. Truly shows what the staff is like if they're able to do this at 7 a.m. The girl that has taken my order, on the day that I ordered the bagel, heated it for me without even asking which I appreciated a lot. I was planning on taking my plate back once I was finished studying, but the same girl came and removed it out of the way for me without me even asking which I also really appreciated. I've also seen the staff clean the tables often both outside and inside. Overall it's a nice, close coffee shop for me to visit if I need to kill time or a place to study. Definitely will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Zack dos a great job over here super friendly I'm a regular at the other location in mountains edge but this one has a better feel on the inside love this spot keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"Pretty sure the chicken salad croissant sandwich is made with crack.... it's so addicting! Best soy lattes ever, too! I'm lucky enough to live at The Gramercy, so I frequent here a lot"}
{"text":"Pretty overpriced for what it is, in my opinion. I guess being in the location makes it more expensive. A latte will run you about $5!? 
The chai vanilla latte, the first time I tried it, was so rich and flavorfully delicious. The second time, however, was quite bland. Inconsistent :-(
The food is quite pricey too. I've had the egg and cheese breakfast burrito and the Turkey Fusion Burger- the burger was almost $7 and was so simply made with a sauce that I think was Thousand Island. Put anything on ciabatta bread and I'll enjoy it.
Not my favorite cafe to work at either. Uncomfortable furniture and dark lighting. Better place to just relax with a friend. They have some board games to play.
It's a cafe I'd stop by only if I really wanted a drink on my way to the to the doctor's (there's lots of medical buildings near here). You see lots of people in business attire mingling during a break."}
{"text":"In a 24/7 city, it is annoying that they close at 3. Most people in Vegas don't even wake up until around noon! I had a hard time finding this place because they are in the depths of gramercy which is difficult to maneuver. Once I did find it, I was pleased with all the seating with outlets and their fast wi fi connection. The cuppa is decorated like a study with bookshelves. I ordered a \"jungle tea\" which was half green tea half black tea which I loved. They serve food as well but I didn't have a chance to look over the menu. I like this place I just wish that they had longer hours."}
{"text":"This is great! It's about time DT Summerlin got a legitimate coffee shop.. granted the location isn't AS accessible as a drop in shop (i.e. if you wanted to come study you'd have to lug your stuff through the mall to get here-- unless you got here right when it opened and parked on the street).

There is ample seating and the atmosphere is nice and lively. 

I brought my pups on a Sunday morning right when they opened. Their beverages are tasty, albeit typical cafe selections and prices. The croissants are delicious. I have yet to try their breakfast selection but I anticipate it will be good also. They also serve meals such as sandwiches, quiche, etc.

I really like the patio seating area. It's enclosed so you can let your dogs roam around a bit (as long as the patio was empty as it was when we were there) without fear of them running into the street. You're also allowed to bring the pups inside while you order. 

I met Holley, the proprietor of the cafe, and she as very nice and responsive. She told me they're hosting a Canine and Coffee on May 20th. I was also able to speak to her about hosting a meet up with my dog group there which she very willingly has accommodated."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here this morning and will never patronize this business again. The cashier lady who had on a red lifeguard hoodie didn't welcome us at all or smile once throughout the ordering process. Her responses to our questions concerning the breakfast options were quick, uncaring and seemingly without knowledge of the product. To reiterate, the service was extremely off putting and alone would be enough to keep me away from here. Our latte and espresso were served in to-go cups even though we were dining in and the preparation of both the glazed cinnamon roll and the bacon, cream cheese jalapeño bagel  were underwhelmingly dull to say the least. Bad experience, won't return :("}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have discovered The Cuppa Coffee Bar as its owned by Holley from Holley's Cuppa! This one just happens to be closer to my office! I love the selection of drinks and FOOD! :-D
Plenty of seating, they have a library, puzzles, games, etc. Really great environment!! I stopped to get some work done and saw a diverse mix of gym rats, students, professionals and friends/families on their time off."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good coffee. I didn't have yea, but it looks like they have great tea. They seem to really focus on quality & service. Staff was very nice & helpful. Easy to connect with. Looks like a good place to open the laptop & get work done."}
{"text":"The best dirty chai ever!!  I pass by about 3 Starbucks and 2 coffee beans to come here for the dirty chai and iced Green tea.  The cinnamon croissants are pretty divine as well."}
{"text":"The fruit slush is literally Kool-Aid with ice .. for $5/$6 I could've made my own Kool-Aid if that's what I wanted."}
{"text":"Finally Downtown Summerlin is home to a coffee shop. After nearly three years, customers no longer have to rely on the tiny Starbuck's in Macy's for a caffeine beverage. As of this past Monday, just down the pedestrian pathway from Macy's is the Cuppa. 

  The Cuppa is just what Downtown Summerlin needed. It is a comfortable space to relax with a caffeinated beverage, a bakery treat, or sandwich. Today, I relaxed with first a cup of drip coffee then a hazlenut late. \"Relaxed\" is the key word because there were plenty of seating arrangements to relax. It's ironic that I visit a coffee house for a caffeine boost yet end up hanging out for a couple of hours mellow. 

  The Cuppa did a fantastic job with creating an inviting third place which is the term for a hangout spot outside of home and work. This is evident before stepping inside. Bordering a pedestrianized streetscape in the heart of Downtown Summerlin, the commodious patio attached to The Cuppa gives the passers-by a subconscious message that this is a place to stop and relax. On a cool April afternoon this was the place to enjoy a hazlenut late. The patio is furnished with tables and sofas. This is the ideal spot for Downtown Summerlin people watching. The inviting environment also permeates the large coffee shop. The walls are adorned with pictures of funny sayings. Halfway into the coffee shop is a library surrounded by plush seats. Bordering the left wall are plate glass windows overlooking Downtown Summerlin. To the right the counter takes up a large portion. 

    I walked to the counter on two occasions to order. The overhead menu made ordering simple. Off the menu, I ordered a medium coffee that costed $2.55 then later a medium hazlenut late that came to around $5.25. Both times, a friendly batista welcomed me. And both times they were in a mug. 

  I thought more highly of the hazlenut late than the coffee. This is one of the deals where the quality was high but I personally did not agree with the taste. It's one of those deals where several people would greatly appreciate it. It is a personal taste thing. Maybe next time I'll try the pour over. On the other hand, the hazlenut late was a taste that I preferred. What is nice is that there is a list of flavors to create the late. Next time I can switch it around with another flavor. I must add that it has a sweet taste for a sugar free syrup. 

  The Cuppa is the missing piece that completed the Downtown Summerlin puzzle. Finally after 2.5 years, Downtown Summerlin is home to a coffee shop where you can spend time in a relaxing setting with a quality caffeinated beverage."}
{"text":"And as soon as it arrived...it was gone. 

I just found out that Cuppa's last day is this Tuesday and I'm SO bummed. Because I basically LIVE in Downtown Summerlin, I'm SUPER bummed that this great coffee shop is leaving so quickly!

It's a super cute place, they have a few book shelves full of books to peruse, and they have a great array of drinks and food. And guys - they have bulletproof coffee!! Granted, I haven't been overly impressed with the coffee overall...it's worth it for the ambience and location. This is SUCH a killer location for a coffee shop, I'm really surprised they didn't do better. (Though, based on all the recent closings, it seems like not many restaurants make it in Downtown Summerlin.) 

The only other coffee shop in the mall is Starbucks, unless you count the espresso bar in that weird guy's clothing store where everything is always 50% off. I'd love another coffee shop to move into this place - I'd even like it if Starbucks just relocated to this spot instead of Macy's! 

Goodbye Cuppa, it was nice while it lasted."}
{"text":"This place gave me the worst food poisoning. I ended up in the hospital. :( I ordered the sausage egg and cheese croissant. It was the gramercy location. Quite bummed because it's a cute little place. I initially was wanting to order chicken salad, I asked how fresh it was and was told it had already been sitting for 5 days. I should've ran!! Sickest ive EVER been!!!"}
{"text":"The Cuppa has become one of my favorite cafes to relax at and read.  This is the second cafe to be opened by the wonderful people at Holley's Cuppa, so you can expect the same quality drinks here.  The interior is quite spacious, with several seating options including a really nice patio area.  They offer a wide variety of coffee beans, as well as almond or soy milk if you prefer lattes.  My go to drink here is and Almond Milk Latte.  For the most part, if you like Holley's Cuppa, you'll like The Cuppa."}
{"text":"Awesome place to chill and have coffee and tea. Holly is super nice, as is everyone who works there."}
{"text":"I really like the feel of this place. It is a very modern place and it looks like something out of a magazine. The bookshelves is full of many books that you can take of the shelf and read. There are many different types of seating places. They range from a higher view to a lower view! And it is very spread out and spacious. I was really in love with how it was set up. 

The next thing that I would like to talk about is the pricing because it is an amazing price! It was cheaper than Starbucks and it was all a decent size. I was very impressed with how much money I had spent on the food we ordered.

Now, lets talk about the coffee and food. First, I would like to stay that they have an amazing selection. I think what really impressed me was there selection of tea. I only got to smell them because by the time I had saw the tea I had already ordered. However, they had one tea called \"jungle\" I believe it smelt so divine and I am going to try that next time. There was another tea that smelt equally amazing but the name escapes me. My sister and I order coffee though. She ordered an iced caramel latte and I ordered and ice hazelnut latte. I was not to impressed with the hazelnut latte. HOWEVER, the caramel latte was one of the best caramel lattes I have ever had. It was a very creamy latte and it tasted like the creamiest caramel was put into this latte! I would def go back for that latte. Lastly, a big plus is they use my favorite type of ice the little circle ones! haha

OH and I guess I should take about the food too! The sandwiches were amazing! The croissants were so nice and flaky and moist! They were toasted to perfection! The food was delicious! Def a good place for breakfast and coffee and to sit down and get some work done!"}
{"text":"I have given up coffee so this review is NOT about coffee...sorry.  This place is located in the Gramery on Russell off of the 215 West.  It is a mixed use development, so The Cuppa picked the right spot.  The place is CLEAN with a lot of seating and seating arrangements, including outside.  It is also very roomy (although the area where you order gets into a \"choke\" area so there's only room for one line to order coffee.)  I met a client here and we sat by the door.  The people just keep coming.  It is a constant flow of many different walks of life.  I had a medium iced Chai Tea, my client a small coffee, and a cinnamon pastry = $10.81, tipped $2 and the change.  I thought the simple order took a bit to make, and you need to watch your order as they do not call you or say your order for pick up.  Maybe asking for your name?  Although everyone that came knew how the system worked.  The pastry...awesome.  Restrooms, clean and awesome.  The people, eh on friendliness. My Chai...a little watery.  I would definitely recommend and will go back with more clients."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment! I love coffee shops. I love the warmth, the service, seeing a variety of drinks...coffee shops are one of my happy places & this was quite the opposite. 

First off, the customer service was terrible. The young man that took our order & made our drinks sounded like he was forced to be there, rather than enjoying his job. I said it was our first time there & he made no suggestions. I tried ordering some pastries but all he said was \"we're out\", no sorry or other suggestion as to what else I may like. The store lost money because after that I decided to get food elsewhere & just order drinks. 

The drinks we did order were a green tea lemonade slush & an iced chai. The slush was okay. Not great but not bad by any means. Just not something I'd order again. Their chai was where I was most let down. I personally base a good coffee shop off their chai & their chai gets 0 stars from me. The entire cup was filled to the top with ice, so I barely had any drink to drink. Also, their chai doesn't even taste like chai. It literally tastes like a watered down horchata. If I wanted horchata I would spend 1/4 of the money & get a horchata from Roberto's. 

Lastly, the rude barista never replied when I said thank you for either of the drinks & my boyfriend made a point to say bye & thank you as we left. To no surprise the barista had nothing to say in response. I would never go back here again & I know a lot of people that go to Downtown Summerlin & I will go out of my way to make sure no one wastes their money here."}
{"text":"If you get a chance to come by for coffee you won't be disappointed the coffee is great and the staff is super cool! It is a must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee shop in town so far. Not much of a selection but a very comfortable place to hang out."}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered The Cuppa in Gramercy, it became my go-to place to read and work. The environment is nice and quiet in this location. When they had the pop up store in DT Summerlin, I didn't care for that location as much. It was too noisy and distracted for reading and working. 

Their menu is pretty simple. My go-to drinks are latte and jungle tea. I haven't tried their flavors on the latte. I enjoy the type of the coffee beans they use a lot. Jungle tea is refreshing. I haven't tried any of their food items. 

The reason that I docked a star is because the cleanliness of the store. I feel like I have to wipe down the tables each time I come in. Other than that, this place is my favorite spot for reading and working on my projects."}
{"text":"The Cuppa is our favorite by far coffee stop. They also have amazing baked goods and Sammie's. This location has fantastic local beers and some wine and... Mimosas!!! So we like a little brunch with our pour overs. The vibe is very comfortable. But you can always just get a cup of joe to go. Really do love this locally owned spot. I commend Holly on her commitment to quality coffee! Also, the service is spot on with recommendations."}
{"text":"The people are super nice. I had a cold brew it was perfect.   You have to try the cinnamon roll croissant it's awesome.   Ask them it heat it up."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 
Super chill and good espresso. 
They have milk substitute options, which is great for my lactose intolerant life."}
{"text":"Excited to find a local coffee spot that has a smaller town feel! Was greeted with enthusiasm when I walked in. I believe Holley was the one who took my order and she answered all of my questions that I had. I loved my latte and the iced coffee was perfect! I can't wait to become a regular because this is close to my new job ;) I'm looking forward to grabbing a book and escaping life in the shop with an iced coffee!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the mall needed a coffee shop. I still prefer Starbucks unfortunately. Also, it's kids friendly which is great for House moms to meet up but if you want peace and quiet maybe not the place for you. The outdoor seating is nice when it's cooler outside."}
{"text":"Fabulous tasting Latte! The Cuppa is a great place for extraordinary coffee, atmosphere and the occasional sandwich when you feel like it. Don't worry they also offer pastries that make your mouth water with the smell and make your mind melt with the flavor. 
Glazed cinnamon roll to the lemon bars can't be overlooked. 
I've always been a coffee fan and coffee shops make it easy to be lazy but it's rare to find a place that checks all the boxes and Cuppa DEFINITELY checks all the boxes."}
{"text":"This is the cutest coffee place around the SW area! It's located in the gramercy business complex which is awesome because I can stop here for my coffee and egg wrap before tackling on my meetings with their super speedy wifi! The staff here are always friendly, attentive, and answer all of my ridiculous questions. They also are great for suggestions when I don't know what to order.

The prices are great and the drinks don't disappoint. My favorite is the matcha latte with almond milk. It's a bit sweet but I love it! Everything is fairly inexpensive compared to Starbucks and other hipster coffee shops in the area. It sucks they close at 6, but that gives me the will to work on my tasks faster. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"New location sprung from Holly's Cuppa. Cool, comfortable coffee spot. Great for Gramercy foot traffic."}
{"text":"My friend Abby and I decided to meet up here a couple of Saturday's ago for a quick coffee date. 

The place was cute, minimally decorated. It looked like a typical coffee shop. The menu seemed promising with lots to offer. Being first timers, we asked what their specialty was and crowd faves. We were told Chai Latte! The lady claimed it's the best you'll ever have lol. Abby opted for that and a Turkey croissant sandwich while I settled on a Nutella Latte and Bacon egg and cheese croissant. 

It was aight. I wouldn't say horrible but definitely not the best I've had. Abby said Chai Latte tasted the same as SB. A few things I didn't like was the fact they served our coffees in regular paper cups. I thought being that they were a smaller chain they would serve them in those big coffee cups especially since we were eating in. Second and my biggest pet peeve is when coffee is served lukewarm. The coffee was weak and you could barely taste the Nutella. Besides the great company I had that morning, I'd say it's a pass. Will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If a really fresh cup of coffee is important to you, visit The Cuppa. 
A picturesque coffee joint located in the middle of a beautiful urban village of The Gramercy.

Cuppa coffee bar has your typical selection of coffee, lattes, and smoothies.
They serve delicious sandwiches like crossiants, wraps, and burgers.
For sweet tooth lovers, there's a variety of cookies, muffins, breads, and cakes made in house which is a huge plus my book.

The vanilla chai latte was awesome, it wasn't as sweet as I was expecting and it had good 
creaminess.
I didn't miss the beef when I sank my teeth into the Turkey Fusion Burger, the roasted peppers, chipotle and pepper jack cheese it's simply divine. 

I love the environment that surrounds the area. I can sit outside in the courtyard enjoying the weather and/or relax inside with a spacious room for socializing and reading.

Holley is a wonderful person and brings out the magic of the shop! 
I could tell she likes connecting with her customers, its a trait I'm always fond of finding."}
{"text":"I love that this place offers food. The turkey fusion burger is so good! It's a little pricey but overall it's really good and convenient since I work on the 4th floor of the same building."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. A great coffee shop to chill out at and it's way better than over rated Starbucks.  Nice place to work play a quiet game of cards or just read and meditate. Great customer service. Clean restaurant and restroom."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee spot! The latte was good and they have French press and drop coffee.

It's very similar to a Starbucks with a little more person touch!"}
{"text":"Ok! Time to update.  I've been 2x in the last 2 days...this means I liked what I had yesterday.  I think my first visit was a fluke as I'm loving this place.

Great job on turning this caffeine addict into a believer!  I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"My coffee is really great! This is a beautiful shop with a lot of comfortable mixed-type seating configurations; great to sit alone or for meetings. As well, the staff is friendly and efficient, and the bathroom is clean (a big deal to me!)."}
{"text":"I believe this is the 3rd The Cuppa location and as the other two locations an extremely pleasant staff!  Coffee is always 'good to the last drop' ;)  Delicious as well! drinks are 'spot' on and are made immediately upon ordering. The Cuppa staff always making sure the tables are kept clean and tidy.  Food is always fresh, however I normally order my caffeine 9 out of the 10 times I do go into The Cuppa:)"}
{"text":"DTS needed a coffee shop. I was desperately hoping for something similar to what Tivoli Village offers. My husband and I ordered iced chai tea lattes. They were adequate, though it had a dominating creamy flavor. Could have used a boost of the spices, I think. 

I want to see The Cuppa do well and I think they should take some things into consideration: 

The seating looks haphazard and really disorganized to the eye. Tables placed wherever, turned this way and that. It also doesn't seem like there's enough tables. 

The empty bookshelves looks sad and messy. Either openly encourage a lending library or buy filler books.

There doesn't seem to be enough outlets. 

The patio needs umbrellas."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needing a place to grab a quick bite to eat since it was a day full of errands with family. I opened up my Yelp app and Cuppa pop up. I had to try this place out since Im always up for trying out different cafes. The cool thing about this place is that there is multiple seating arrangements and a spacious outdoor patio, great for days when Vegas has mild weather.

We were greeted and promptly served by the friendly Barista. She reccomended a few items and ended up getting a few Sandwiches on croissants. They were good and fresh just needed more of a flavor but the croissants were soft and flakey. However, our drinks were ok and the espresso beans was a bit bitter probably was a bad batch. The saving grace for my visit was the Vanilla Chai Latte over Iced. This was really good and consistent flavoring with a good amount of spice and sweetness. Gonna have to come back to try them out again!

2017 Yelp Review #40"}
{"text":"What a nice find in Downtown Summerlin!  Great little coffee shop with inside and outside seating.  Nice menu and super friendly staff!  I look forward to stopping by again!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer or another location opened in Henderson!

I LOVE this coffee shop - they never seem to disappoint! I haven't tried too many signature beverages as I am a \"stick to what I know\" kinda girl when it comes to coffee. Usually I get a cold brew or a regular latte with different flavors and coconut milk.

If you have a cheat meal/snack I suggest the frosted croissant, well worth the calories and sugar! LOL"}
{"text":"Love this place! First time was the other day with my best friend. The atmosphere is very cozy yet modern and the outside area is super cute! My coffee was excellent and we each ordered a breakfast burrito, mine had sausage, cheese, spinach, tomatoes, roasted red peppers and onion...seriously the best ever! Everything was of the perfect consistency and the roasted red peppers were definately what made it!! Two thumbs up!! Love that its close to my house as well!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place.  I can't believe I haven't tried a glazed croissant until now! The breakfast sandwiches are beautifully and quickly made.  The Bacon, Egg, and Cheese on croissant is fabulous, and even the iced green tea is light and perfectly brewed.  Smiling faces, early open, quick service, excellent food!  It's perfect!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! I have been waiting for a good coffee shop to open at Downtown Summerlin foreverrrr! Lol. I'm especially glad that it's The Cuppa since I've always been a fan of their Russell location & it's nice to have a local coffee shop in the Summerlin area that isn't a Starbucks chain. 

First off, GREAT coffee! I am absolutely in love with their White Mocha Latte with almond milk and it's one of the reasons I keep coming back here. My friend also tried their Lavender Latte & we agreed that it's one of the bests! Definitely recommend those drinks for sure. Their Matcha Latte is alright, I really wanted to like it but I couldn't really taste the green tea flavor. 

Second, I love how it's a nice study spot! Keep in mind it doesn't have a lot of outlets and it can be a tad bit noisy when it gets busy but I love going here since it closes at 9pm (which is later than most!) and it's nearby my house which is a plus since other coffee shops that stay open late are pretty far from me. 

Third, their outdoor patio is ideal for those who love to bring their pups! I'm always at DTS with my dog and their patio is enclosed with a gate so you don't have to worry about your dogs running off lol. 

Fourth, love their atmosphere and how they have a good amount of seating inside and outside. They even have a nice little library of books if you just wanna enjoy a cup of coffee and a good read!

They do offer pastries and some savory croissants but their menu of food isn't much. They also have great customer service and are pretty fast in making your coffee. 

As a nursing student, I'm definitely happy to finally have a great coffee and study place in DTS!"}
{"text":"Fall in Vegas and it was a high of 80's! I could not be locked up inside studying and needed a place to venture off too. Everyone thinks of The Gramercy as just a residential community. But it is more then that. I came across The Cuppa & during operating hours. I always saw & heard about it but never had the chance to test it out for myself & boy am I glad I did. 

Saturday afternoon & it was a perfect setting for anyone to unwind from the busy work week. I have been on a tea latte kick lately. Today I went with the Matcha/Green Tea latte with almond milk. They also have soy should you want to go that route. It was perfect for an afternoon treat & oh so creamy. I must say I am a sucker for crushed ice with my beverages and this place had it! It will always be my preferred local shop that I will continue to support. 

Go out and try it to all you coffee & tea addicts!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from the Cuppa and have to resist coming here everyday. I always get an iced coconut latte, it's delicious. The berry muffins are fresh and the hummus wrap is a great choice, Love this place!"}
{"text":"It's pricey, basically the same price as Starbucks, but the Vanilla Iced Latte is really good and I usually get a bagel. The workers are a little snooty, but the atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"LOTS OF POTENTIAL

Open for less than a month, The Cuppa is a cool new coffee spot in the Gramercy Plaza off of Russell near Fort Apache.  Currently, there is a ton of construction going on Russell Road so it's only one lane in each direction.  I exited the 215 and had to turn around at Fort Apache to get here, but once I was here, it was fine.  However, I had a short visit because I arrived 30 minutes before they closed on a Friday afternoon. 

Right now, business hours are Monday-Friday, 6:00am-4:00pm, Saturday and Sunday, 7:00am-2:00pm.  Hours will probably be extended once business picks up per Charlie, the tall, personable barista/cashier.
I ordered a small Mexican Spice.  Charlie said that right now they're the only food place in the plaza, but DW Bistro and Pinches Tacos are going to be arriving, as well.  I can see how this place probably get more action earlier in the day from the businesses in the complex.  

I liked my drink and the chat I had with Charlie while I was there.  Lots of seating available in a nice, open space.  They offer pastries, cookies, bagels, sandwiches, along with coffees, smoothies, and teas.  The also offer free wi-fi if you want to plug in while you sip or chew.

For my first, abbreviated visit, The Cuppa is definitely A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"An extensive list of coffee options as well as a pretty good selection of loose teas. Food is alright, mostly all microwaved foods. I would recommend it for a snack or breakfast on the go, but it's not a sit down food place. Not well equipped to handle the morning rush of a business complex. Ordered a tuxedo mocha and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"We'd ridden our bikes past this place dozens of times and I knew we needed to start/end a ride from here very soon. So today was the day and we weren't disappointed!  Not only was the coffee VERY good... the baristas were lovely and the seating comfy and spacious! Love the library area with the books and the puzzle table for having some extra fun with friends. The Cuppa will be a place we return to soon. Great find!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is very good but extremely understaffed. Do not plan on coming here if you need to be on time to anything. Expect to spend at least 30-40 minutes here waiting."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Everyone is so happy and friendly. It makes getting coffee a pleasure and I've never had a bad experience here. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"THE BEST MOCHA I HAVE EVER HAD! I moved away and I make it a point to come here every time I'm in town for a visit. It's that good."}
{"text":"I love this place. 

What I love most is the outdoor seating that The Grammercy offers. So many comfy seating options to sit out on the patio and relax. 

Inside is cute too. Seating areas with lots of books. The place could use some art on the walls in the back but who cares really. You can grab a table and study or read and there's a good view of the mountains. 

The service has always been friendly. Their prices are reasonable and they have a few food options. I feel like it's a way better value and flavor for coffee than going to Starbucks and you can support local."}
{"text":"The coffee here is really good...have tried the Ethiopian and Costa Rica just to name a couple. Love the Costa Rican.  The Sausage Egg and Cheddar is very good.  Has different seating areas...also a place outside.   Employees are nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"Good coffee, nice selection of roasts and varieties. Food is ok, not amazing. Baristas are a little dismissive, compared to most service in the valley. It seems many customers here want to be seen as \"coffee shop\" people, so look for amusement there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to work, read or connect while having a drink-coffeee, tea or H2O.
Very cordial staff to boot!"}
{"text":"Had lunch, super friendly, they just got alcohol licence. They said the report is to short so I am adding this. They are awesome"}
{"text":"Decent coffee, decent espresso, fairly comfortable seats, friendly staff. Not too many outlets, but I think I saw a few. Probably the only place worth going to in all of the shopping area, in terms of food."}
{"text":"As a place to study, this gets a 5. The music isn't too loud, the seats are comfy and plentiful. And overall it's fairly quiet.

Sadly the beverages aren't that good. I'd say the latte is about a 2 star quality, definitely disappointing. If they could elevate the espresso quality, it'd be a great place. As it is, it's a mixed bag."}
{"text":"I love this place!  If you're like me and enjoy working/playing around on the computer at a coffee shop but, Starbucks is either too packed or too loud, then this is the spot for you!  

There are always open tables, a cute book shelf with tons of books to read, and couches to relax on.  Not only do they have coffee but yummy teas (iced or hot).  They also have pastries and sandwiches that are delicious! Service is great and the place is always clean.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this cute little spot, but their coffee was anything but what I had hoped. I get my nails done at the salon next door and was out of coffee, so I was really excited to get my morning caffeine fix, that is until I tried my latte and thought WTF?!

The espresso was either bad quality, over brewed, or both. I was also disappointed in the lack of variety of non-dairy milk (they have soy or almond, no coconut). Considering this is a locally owned coffee shop, I would expect at least the offerings of Starbucks/other LV based coffee shops. They also had zero gluten-free and vegan options, which was also a bummer. 

I also found it rather offensive that the shop smelled strongly of pine-sol or something similar--an employee was mopping the floors while we were sitting and trying to enjoy our coffee. Personally, I feel this should be reserved for closing/opening duties. It certainly isn't appetizing to huff chemical solvents while eating or enjoying a beverage. For the price of my latte and my mom's coffee and day-old pastry, I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a place to get my bulletproof coffee fix without driving all the way downtown. I stopped in the cuppa and there it was! I ordered the largest option available and added cinnamon and vanilla. It was less than $5! It tasted great and kept me laser focused for hours. Vanessa was my barista; she was very nice and recommended I add chai to it next time. I'll be back for sure now since I love getting live recommendations. Extra star for customer service."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! I decided to try it after my workout, and I really like this place. I was in a hurry so just ordered a regular drink, chai tea latte, dirty. I liked how they offered it dirty, no where else ever offers that, so then I forget you can get a chainlike that. I did two shots of espresso and it was amazing. I will definitely be back to this place. My friend got the mango tea, and she also said her drink was really good. The decor and vibe is really laid back, I love it."}
{"text":"Cute vibe!!!! 
I came in here as I had finished eating, and wanted to grab some coffee or slushy. They have some unique selections here, and I enjoyed my drink. 

Service was OK. I think I got some weird looks 'cuz I sure ain't no expert in coffee and had some questions about their menu. AKA, I was semi-excited about some of the stuff they had. Hey man, I'm a newbie at your location, gimme a break here. 

Anyways, it wasn't the most amazing frappuccino of my life, but it did the job."}
{"text":"Two words. Dirty. Chai. 

I've visited this spot for meetings and posted up to get some work done. It's a great location at The Grammecy with some other local businesses surrounding it and the building offers lots of parking. They have a large menu and friendly staff. 

My favorite drink is an Dirty Chai with almond milk. They use a powdered chai which is a game changer. It's so creamy and adds a richness that you must experience. Subtle hints of sweet spices. Y.U.M. Making it dirty is adding espresso, but be warned that each shot will cost you. This drink is a decadent treat that I hope you enjoy as much as I do. 

There is lots of seating, free WiFi, and although I have not eaten much here, there is decent food. Be careful of the tall palette table though. I skinned my knee on it one morning and that was a real bummer."}
{"text":"So excited to have a great coffee shop at DTS. Coffee, sweets and service was great. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is one of my \"go-to\" places on a Sunday morning before church. I've been here twice and each time was better than the last. The first time I had the hazelnut mocha latte which was delicious but I wanted to continue trying other things so I had the peppermint mocha latte and it was better than advertised. Not very busy for a Sunday morning but that's to be expected given it's location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot so far to come and study. Located in the Gramercy complex. It's small and tucked away next to raw fitness. 

The staff is super welcoming and friendly. My study group and I came here three weeks in a row to study together. The only downside is that there's no shade on the back window area so it can get hot and the sun can get in your eyes if you're studying at one of those tables. 

My favorite coffee is the white mocha with almond milk. I'm lactose so it's a plus they have the almond milk substitute for me instead of regular milk. 

The WiFi in this coffee shop doesn't time you out after two hours which is a plus compared with Madhouse coffee. 

I also really like how you can study in the court yard outside of the cuppa in the center of Gramercy. Overall, I would suggest this place for studying as well as coming to dine at one of their various tests restaurants."}
