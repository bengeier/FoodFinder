{"text":"The food is original and tasty. My favorite sandwich was the pork one but so are the beef and chicken. The soup and fries are also delicious. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. The owner is also very hands on and pays attention to service. This place is a must-try!"}
{"text":"I *really* wanted to jump on the bandwagon and give this place 5 stars. However, I think I can only give it a 4 in good yelp-conscious. The menu is very small (I took a picture..if I can figure out how to upload it here I will) but the sandwiches sound delicious. I had the Smoked Chicken with pickled chili mop sauce, chicken cracklin, chimmi churrie and fried avocado. The taste and size was really good for $7. However (this is where they lost their star) there was cartilage in the chicken which made me have to spit out little pieces which was a bit disappointing. The fried avocado on the sandwich really added something though.  The wait is a little long too (granted they make it all after you order). Not a place to go in a rush but definitely a place to go if you have some time and want something delicious. The people I went with had: Beer Battered Fried Fish, the Grilled Pork Chop and the Fried Tomato all of which were really good apparently."}
{"text":"Great new place.   Everything is made to order. You can tell the owner Doan puts love into what he makes.   The fries are excellent!  Crispy. Non-greasy. Irregular shape adds to the texture.   I had the oyster po'boy. Others with me had the smoke chicken, fish, and pulled pork. I liked the smoked chicken the most. The fired avocados were great. The chicken and pork sandwiches are very reasonably priced @ $7. Comes with fries. I've seen Big Smoke food truck charge $10 for just a pulled pork sandwich without fries.   The condiments were fresh and homemade. eg coleslaw, spicy mayo, tartar sauce. All were excellent.   The owner/chef is open to feedback and likes talking to customers. It's refreshing that an establishment actually listens to its customers.   This is a cozy little spot that is worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great place. Had the Turkey sandwich and it was delish.   Was there for lunch and it looks like it can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"I read a review in the newspaper and decided to make my way here. I had the fried tomato sandwich and french fries and they were both yummy. Will have to try the grilled avocado and salad soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!! I had a hard time deciding which sandwich to get but ended up with the buttermilk fried turkey sandwich. It was seriously awesome. I had to wait about 8 minutes so im not sure how fast they are on a busy day. The bread was crispy and the turkey was like popcorn chicken! The cranberry and cilantro coleslaw fit perfectly with the turkey and the smokey mayo topped it off. I will definitely be back. The sandwich was a bit more expensive than i was wanting to spend but overall worth it."}
{"text":"Had the pork chop sandwich, the flavor was fantastic. The meat was moist and plentiful. I will go back."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I was extremely impressed with the sandwiches here.  I got the smoked chicken and it came with pork crackling, chimmi churrie, and fried avocados...wow the combined flavours were amazing!  My boyfriend got the pork chop and it was super tender and delicious.  We also got the fries and honestly, it was the best fries in Toronto.  I recommend everyone to check out this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during my break at school. Food was very delicious and made quickly. I had a pork sandwich, and the meat was tender and tasty. Sandwich pricing ranges between $7.50 - $10.50, and the portion size is large."}
{"text":"My friends and I got grilled halibut and pork chop sandwiches, 4.5/5. Perfectly cooked and served with golden fries. Many sandwiches miss on the sauce but this place puts just the proper amount."}
{"text":"They have a great pork sandwich and the fries are ok. The service is quick and the staff is friendly. They're vietnamese sandwich is also very good."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches made fresh to order, this hidden gem is well worth trying out. The buns are a bit fragile but it's what's inside that counts and dam is it delicious.  The Vietnamese is a simple spin on what you find on most buns but it's jammed with flavor as the cubed meat provides a chewy texture.  The Chicken avocado is great. What tastes like a pesto spread with tender roast chicken and crispy deep fried avocado is pretty unbeatable.  But it's the Tomato sandwich that is the true winner here. An imaginative combination of flavors and textures with the deep fried sweet tomatoes is perfect for a quick sandwich on the go.  Don't miss out on the fries either. They are triple fried and a crispy outside makes the gooey inside all the better."}
{"text":"This place is seriously filling the gap for quick, high quality meals in the area. And the prices are very reasonable, too (lots of sandwiches under $10). I had the Vietnamese style smoked pork, kind of similar to a banh mi with pickled veggies and cilantro on a nice, soft portugese bun. The meat was deliciously well-seasoned.   A note to peanut / tree but allergy sufferers: there were cashews on one menu item while I was there, but the guy (the owner I think) was very careful in washing his hands and keeping prep separate.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dear Clubhouse: you're delicious.   These sandwiches are amazing and always made fresh to order (so, note: call ahead or go elsewhere if you want your food ready NOW). Who would think that a fried tomato and eggplant sandwich would be so sinfully tasty? This reviewer, that's who. I can't remember exactly what's in the veg sandwich, but it includes fried tomato, arugula, eggplant, goat cheese (maybe feta?), secret yummy sauce, maybe avocado? It doesn't really matter, just get one. The bf usually has the chicken, but also enjoys the kim-cheese sandwich.   Last time I visited, I asked about whether the kim-cheese (yes, kimchi and fried cheese) could be made vegetarian, and the chef/owner recommended subbing some fried avocado in place of the chicken. At this point, I'm not going to argue with any taste suggestion made by him - once they were out of arugula so he subbed other greens and an additional sauce (after checking with me), and it was delish.   Did I mention the fries? These are some of the Best. Ever. Fries. I've Ever. Had (yes, I said 'ever' twice). They are double, nay, triple fried! Perfectly crispy friedness on the outside, yet soft and potato-ey on the inside. You absolutely must add a side to your sandwich order (only $3 more to add a side of fries or salad to your sandwich - I think regular fry order is usually $4 or $5). When I found out they started offering poutine, my head nearly exploded (haven't tried it yet!).   A sandwich will run you about $7-11, but keep in mind that these are big, filling suckers, and may contain deep-fried things, so sometimes I have a hard time finishing mine.   Also, the chef/owner is super sweet and obviously really cares about his food. We've called in/dropped by to order several times, and he's always accommodating and friendly.   Finally - check their site/social media/call in for daily or weekly special sandwiches."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are usually pretty good but the wait times are atrocious. I just waited 30 minutes for a sandwich,and my coworker waited 45 minutes last week. They must be chronically understaffed. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and sides.  Decent value and reasonably fast. Gets a bit cold in the winter though."}
{"text":"I have no clue why I haven't been in here till now but I finally had a reason to stop and grab food while on my way home.  Clubhouse is tiny and almost looks like a daycare lunch room. The little seats and communal table are a perfect size for the shop and are actually pretty cute.  They have a pretty large menu filled with what I would consider gourmet sandwiches. Fried buttermilk turkey with cilantro coleslaw and grilled pork chop with caramelized onions and herb aioli? Them's good eats.  I'll have to add this one to my usual haunts list."}
{"text":"I decided to try this no-frills lunch spot after reading and hearing a lot of great things.   I ordered the Basil Marinated Fried Tomato sandwich - the only true vegetarian option on their menu.   The service was friendly and fast - I was in and out within five minutes.   Served on a fresh kaiser, the fried tomatoes were crisp and the roasted eggplant and avocado spread gave the sandwich a light and savoury splash of flavour. It was topped with arugula, diced red onions and goat cheese - a great combination with the mild nature of the tomatoes, eggplant and avocado.   I didn't order a side, which I regretted. The sandwich alone wasn't enough to keep me full.   Overall, The Clubhouse Sandwich Shop is welcomed addition to the arsenal of lunch options in the College/Spadina area. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients for the price. I come here often and I love the Vietnamese/pork chop. Great lunch spot near UTSG. Expect a wait time during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Wow.  I walked past this place a few times, figuring it was just a deli or something and thought, \"Yeah, I'll try that place at some point.\"  Today was that day -- and it was so much more than expected.  Great lunch spot.  Seriously good food, especially on a cold/wet day.  The place is pretty unassuming, just a little storefront at the College/Spadina intersection (northeast corner; along Spadina) and even when you go in, there are just about 6 or 7 things on the menu and a couple specials - I think all sandwiches are served hot, but don't quote me.  I had the Marinated Pork Chop sandwich, and my wife had the Vietnamese Pork.  Both were really incredible.  The pork chop was sort of an italian-type flavor profile with the herb aioli, while the Vietnamese pork was like a cross between a banh mi and a deli sandwich.  Both came on a big soft Kaiser roll (roll:filling ratio very good), which was delicious.  Prices were fair, around $8 for a real good sandwich.  Took a little longer for food to come out than expected for what is largely a take-out lunch spot, but worth the wait.  We waited maybe 10 or so mins and it wasn't that busy at the time.  A few chairs can be had, or a stand-up counter with bag hooks.  The will do call-ahead orders according to a sign on the wall."}
{"text":"A really tasty grilled marinated pork chop sandwich in a minimalist space  Pros: - The pork itself was incredibly flavourful and the sweet hit from the caramelized onions worked well with the pork. (However, I'd like the option of putting some greens on the sandwich like rapini or arugula so there would've been a bit more contrast and texture.) - Snuck a few of my friend's fries which are excellent -- chunky and crispy with the faintest hint of smokiness. (Maybe they cooked some bacon in the oil?) - Space is clean and pretty cool. There are some substantial stools, but also a long narrow table in the middle with colourful chairs.  Cons: - The pork cracklings had gone soft. It was a rainy day, so the humidity may have gotten to the cracklings. - The floor was quite slippery with wet shoes and it wasn't just me and my friend. They need to figure out something for snowy/rainy days because a slip 'n fall isn't fun for anyone, including the shop (lawsuit waiting to happen comes to mind).  Definitely will return to try some other sandwiches, like the oyster po boy and the smoked chicken."}
{"text":"Got the marinated pork chop sandwich which was DELICIOUS.  The fries were great too, but I made a serious error in judgement by getting both - the sandwiches are BIG.  I couldn't finish it.  Unfortunately, the girl behind the cash was a little rude and really unhelpful when ordering, but it seemed like it was a busy day.  Not the cheapest sandwiches, but they are really fresh and taste amazing - worth every penny."}
{"text":"This review is made especially for all the vegetarians out there. As I was perusing through the restaurant's chalk written blackboard menu, what caught my eye was their basil marinated fried tomato sandwich. I've never heard of a sandwich based on a fried tomato before but I was in the mood to try something new so I was eager to test it out.   It's worth mentioning that I'm an avid meat lover so trying out a meatless sandwich for me is like venturing off into unchartered waters. As I took a bite out of that fried tomato sandwich, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious a meatless sandwich can be!   The fried tomato was nicely battered and had a delicious crunchy texture and taste. What really topped off the sandwich off for me was the delicious blend of roasted eggplant, avocado spread, and goat cheese toppings. Those three toppings added a very creamy flavour with a hint of salt which really enhanced the flavour of the sandwich.   All I can say is that I didn't feel like I was eating some bland vegetarian concoction but something very delicious and flavourful. I would highly recommend trying out the basil marinated fried tomato sandwich, even for the self professed meat lovers out there."}
{"text":"Our ELD class went to this restaurant on December 11th 2013 around 12pm for lunch. We all had sandwiches, some tried the chicken and some tried the pork. Some of us also got fries. We all agree that the sandwiches tasted good. Some of us did not like that the chicken filling fell out of our sandwiches when we ate them and it was not comfortable to eat. We felt that the fries looked ugly but they were pretty tasty. After eating our sandwiches we are not hungry anymore because they were big enough to fill us up. We felt that the food was fresh and tasty. Those of us who got the pork sandwich found that it was cold, but that might have been because they made it ahead of time for us. The sandwiches were tasty but it would be nice if they increased the menu selection. The menu was written in chalk and was a little difficult to read.    The service was so-so, the man who helped us was very friendly and took our order ahead of time to make sure that we had our food when we arrived. However, Adilbek of Khazkhstan did not like the service provided by the lady because she was perfunctory in the way that she served us. We found the restaurant was small and it was uncomfortable to sit at the bar or table. We recommend that if you want to try the sandwiches, you should take them out. Some of us liked the decor and thought that it was natural looking. We also thought it was boring to sit and eat without any music, some of us heard music but we think it was coming from the kitchen. It's weird to not have music in the dining area. Why should they have music while we do not? Another suggestion would be to have a television in the dining area for customers. Adilbek of Khazkhstan suggests that they check out the Boxing Day Sales for a new television."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:  We came on a weekend mid-afternoon.  Place was empty.  Owner is cool and nice.  The place needs more seating.  Alot of places to stand and eat your sandwich off a ledge, but only a single communal table with a handful of chairs.  I understand it's a casual place and there seems to be two workers at most, but talk about dirty.  There are crumbs all over the tables and chairs and floor. The girl in the front should learn to busy herself with cleaning if she isnt taking orders.  Second time I was there, same thing...crumbs everywhere.  The order takes awhile, so order ahead of time.  FOOD:  I had a calamari sandwich and fries here.  Good sandwich, nice textures and flavours.  I really wanted the steak, but I couldn't have rare meat at the time.  The fries tho blew my mind!  They are easily some of the best fries I have had in Toronto.  I came back for a poutine a week later, cuz I thought those fries in poutine-form would bring it to a new level, but nope.  The fries are somehow better unadulterated.  This place has been added to my lunch rotation.  (Just clean those surfaces more, guys.)"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, great service and reasonable prices.  I was in the area and looking for a quick lunch. This place showed up on Yelp so I figured I'd give it a try.  I ordered the special which was a Vietnamese-style smoked pork sandwich. My friend had the smoked chicken. Both sandwiches arrived fresh and packed with delicious fillings. Roughly $7 each which isn't too bad considering the quality of the ingredients.   If you are in the area, this is a must try for a quick sandwich. Next time I drop by, I'll have to try the fries which looked amazing."}
{"text":"There are days when I crave a really nice sandwich, one that has the perfect amount of filling between the softest bread. I looked up best sandwich spots on yelp and Clubhouse popped up.  I ended up trying the chicken sandwich and boy oh boy was it delicious! I absolutely loved the fried avocado in-between and the slight sweetness to the sandwich.   I'm absolutely coming again to more!  PS: It's a pretty small place so going in groups unless you want to do take out."}
{"text":"Overall: This place is like your underrated but impressive next door neighbour. It's a tiny inconspicuous shop beside Smokes Poutine that's easily missed.   Price: Most sandwiches are $8-9, and then there's the super baller fried turkey that's $10 BEFORE tax! The sides are aroind $4 or $5.  Food: This is another place that conjures up unique flavours that WORK. If you want something lighter, go for the fried tomato. If you're wanna completely indulge in comfort food, I'd suggest the fried calamari, turkey, or the BEER battered fried fish (on the oily side, but... Beer batter... It's designed to drown your sorrows). Most of their fried stuff is crispy rather than greasy, so you can still maintain a level of class while internally foodgasming. Today I had the grilled pork chops. It was slightly on the dry side and could use more veggies, but I loved the pork cracklin they throw in.   Service: The best part is you can order ahead so you don't have to wait up to 20 minutes in line! They also offer catering!"}
{"text":"A quaint sandwich shop with some unique offerings! I had the chicken parmesan sandwich which was pretty standard, I'd recommend trying out one of the other options. My boyfriend had the buttermilk fried turkey and absolutely loved it, the fillings were generous and the turkey was super crispy and the sandwich was very tasty. Their fries were also great, thick cut but double (or triple?) fried, making them very crunchy! The prices are reasonable for the portion sizes (~$7-10, + $3 for fries). A nice place to stop by for lunch, we ordered through Ritual, which is always fairly quick so I can't comment on the wait but I look forward to trying out some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"Cute lil place for banh mi styled sandwiches. Absolutely delicious, but order ahead, or be prepared to wait -even for a single sandwich. No complaints, can eat a few of these in a sitting at these prices ;)"}
{"text":"Came by for lunch after yelping places around me. Surprised that I've never came across this place during my undergrad years.  I ordered the basil fried tomato sandwich after reading all the amazing review - yes it's true. Do yourself a favour and get one! It comes with arugula, goat cheese, eggplant & avocado spread and it's definitely yummy! I do find the price $7.25 plus tax a little on the expensive side though.   Nonetheless, I would recommend this place and will be coming back to try their other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were horrified one day when we peeked at the kitchen and we saw the cook had dropped a grilled bun and he immediately picked it up to serve it to customers... Do not go there. Extremely unsanitary."}
{"text":"One of the best deals in Toronto for lunch. Great marinated pork sandwich with amazing aioli, onions and just the right amount of crackling for under $8 if I recall. So delicious. Not usually a fan of thick cut fries but these were crispy on outside, piping hot and pillowy soft on the inside. Absolutely massive portion. They ran out of buns once 3 hrs before closing which was annoying because I made a special trip there but just shows you how popular this place deserves to be."}
{"text":"Fries are amazing -- Very unique and some of the best in Toronto. Tried the Pork sandwich, which was great for the price. Only downside was the wait for the food, but will let that slide as the place is only a few weeks old! Intend to go back and try something else from that yummy-looking menu."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a quality sandwich. I had the grilled pork sandwich, and it was delicious! There was some flavourful crackling in there, and the pork was tender.   The sandwiches are made to order, so while they come out warm and fresh, it takes 10 minutes even with no one else in line."}
{"text":"Very slow service times we went. Its also on the expensive side for their sandwich. Otherwise very nice sandwiches and they sell cream soda in bottles."}
{"text":"Well then - this one caught me by surprise.  I love sandwiches. Be it greasy California sandwhiches, \"crappy\" Subway, or something high-brow, I love them. Two pieces of bread with meat + sauce in between? I'm sold.  On the other hand, I'm very particular about fries. I hate wedges. I like to make my own, super thin and crispy, with no mushy potato in the middle.  I had the chicken sandwhich. It was OK. Dry. Tasty, the bun was legitimate, but still, I expected more.  On the flip side, I love the fries. Thick wedges of sheer deliciousness. You don't even need ketchup or any extraneous sauce - just eat them as-is.  So for now, \"Yay! I'm a fan\" is the rating. I have to come back to try the pork or flank steak next time."}
{"text":"A cute little place at College and Spadina that make speciality sandwiches to suit every palette. Their combinations are pretty unique and each sandwich is a different experience on its own. They also have rotating weekly specials in case you're looking for something other than whats on their main menu.  I visited last week for lunch and was pretty pleased. I ordered the Fried Tomato sandwich with a  side of fries. Since it was lunch time, it was pretty busy and took around 15 minutes to get our orders. Luckily, we found seats to seat our group of 5 but more often than not, you're not going to be lucky. There's about 6 seats in total and then standing room in case you'd like to wolf down your sandwich right then and there.   In terms of the sandwich, it arrived piping hot and you could tell each one is made to order. In terms of flavour though, I did think it was a little bland and could've used a spicy sauce like chipotle mayo or hot sauce to kick it up a bit. The \"triple fried\" fries were pretty tasty, but personally, I feel like they were quite salty and oily and absorbed a lot of the oil from the triple frying. A sandwich on its own can probably fill you up considering they come pretty stuffed with ingredients.   Prices were reasonable, each sandwich was around $7-10 and sides were $3-5 more.   A cute place to check out if you're looking to find a new lunch spot near UofT."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches at clubhouse sandwich shop. They have unique items! I have two faves....  1) Smoked chicken sandwich. love the fried avocado they put in it! so good!   2) Another fave of mine is the beer battered fried fish sandwich. Your toes will curl when you try it. Its phenominal! Love the crust, and the home made tartar sauce!  This place also has great fries, salad, and soup.  Must try!"}
{"text":"Clubhouse came up as one of the best sandwich places in my 5 minute google searches of places to check out so away I went!  I ordered up the Smoked Chicken not really knowing what to expect but assumed it would be good.  It was almost a pulled chicken with just the right amount of sauce.  The only fault I found was that for 10 bucks for coke&sandwich it really wasn't that large.  I feel a bit guilty about it because the portion size is probably what my doctor would recommend but hey, pass me another scoop of that chicken!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a not-so-bad-for-you cheat day meal, go here. Don't try to be healthy or skimp on the fries.   This place is the definition of bun-filling ratio.  All the sandwiches are amaze balls. The smoked pork butt is my favorite and gives me another reason to love big butts. It's by far my favorite sandwich in Toronto. The turkey, chicken, calamari are all good as well. Everything is made to order and customizable but don't be fancy. Trust them! Their balance is incredible.  Ok....I just salivated so much thinking about all this deliciousness that I had to take a salivation break.   The fries are amazing also. Super crunchy on the outside and exactly how fries should be. Triple fried. Don't skimp. Go for it."}
{"text":"The smoked chicken sandwich is amazing. The fried avocados really added to it! The fries are also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great fresh creative delicious sandwich and yummy crunchy fries.  I got the fried calamari sandwich. Which was awesome.  Back for the fried tomato and eggplant veggie option tomorrow"}
{"text":"Either my turkey sandwich was made with pork or that was the most fat I've ever seen on a turkey sandwich. Either way, it wasn't very enjoyable."}
{"text":"A favourite by Toronto university students! During my regular commute, I pass by this tiny shop but never really considered walking in. Remember, you can never judge a book by its cover.  This shop is home to a variety of unique sandwiches, trust me when I say unique. You can check out their website for more details. It's great that you can get the full menu with prices beforehand. I ordered the Vietnamese Style Smoke Pork. I would have preferred the bun to be on the softer side. In particular, the bun was quite stiff and I had to pull it with my teeth for every bite I took.  Taste wise, I really enjoyed how the flavours meshed. It was a spicy twist on your popular Vietnamese Banh Mi - XO Mayo was drizzled on. I didn't think this sandwich would make me full but it did, surprisingly. And I didn't get a food coma, which would usually happen after I have any burger with a beef patty and cheese from some big burger chain. The meat in this sandwich was chewy but not too chewy. At least they were in small pieces... On another note, I can't wait to come back and try their vegetarian sandwich consisting of eggplant and tomatoes...delish!  They do close pretty early (8 PM for weekdays and 6 PM on Saturdays) so don't try to come here after a long night of partying and/or studying!"}
{"text":"What a cute spot. Minimalist, tidy and colourful right down to the garbage bin - that's exactly my M.O. My girlfriends brought me here and it was the perfect place for a super-caj dinner.  We had the fried fish sandwich ($11 - too much), veggie sandwich ($7), poutine ($?) and a couple of fancy pops (after much debate, we chose lavender and blood orange, $3 each). Mr. Adorable Sandwich Chef whipped everything up quick and it was all tasty! Based on the prices I thought the sandwiches would be bigger. Fries were great, as everyone says. Poutine could have used a little more cheese and the fish a little less batter. A bit too much bread.  3.5 stars rounded up for the service. I'd love to see a rotating veggie or fish special - something exciting - to compete with all the meat options."}
{"text":"I was wandering the area and the clean sign, and smart interior design had me curious. AWESOME sandwiches. They have only been open a few weeks and I go there every opportunity I have. Very thoughtfully put together sandwiches and menu. I recommend the pork sandwich. the quality of the meat is excellent, well cooked, and it filled me up(and I eat a lot). Amazing friendly staff. Also consider getting the salad instead of fries. The salads are equally amazing.   Best sandwich shop I've been to in a long time. Reminds me of Bahm mi boys. I can see this place getting insanely busy when school starts again. Perfect set up for students."}
{"text":"I had the only vegetarian sandwich, and a side of fries. Cost about $11, which was a bit expensive for lunch (for me) but still reasonable for what I got. Also, I was very full by the end of the meal.  Best part was the fries, they were amazing! I'll definitely go back for just an order of these. The sandwich was tasty, but a little...uninteresting? It seemed like the sandwich was a side for the fries. And since the sandwich cost about $7 by itself, I probably won't get that next time.  That said, it's entirely possible the meat sandwiches are more exciting and worth it.  Service was pretty cold, but whatever, the food was good! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome. Why the low rating? This place uses Ritual, the line skipping app, and they don't staff themselves properly for lunch rushes. I used to come in once a week, but after waiting 35 minutes for a sandwich, which came out as the wrong order due to a cashier error, no way in hell I was going to wait for a replacement."}
{"text":"After seeing the Buttermilk Fried Turkey sandwich featured on You Gotta Eat Here, I definitely had to give it a try. It's basically a twist on the classic, southern fried chicken and coleslaw, but sandwiched between a Kaiser roll  I was worried that the sandwich might've been a bit too 'bready' but the sandwich was loaded with lots of fried turkey and remained moist and crispy to the very last bite. I don't know what they put in the batter mix, but whatever it is, it's deep fried goodness! The cranberry-cilantro was a nice complement; far superior to the standard lettuce and tomatoes on typical sandwich. While the sandwich probably doesn't need extra mayo, I think I would've liked a bit more of the smoky mayo and for it to be spread on the bun as opposed to being drizzled on the coleslaw. Nonetheless, it was still a very delicious sandwich.  The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is the wait time. I went on a quiet afternoon and it took close to 10 minutes for my sandwich to be made despite me being the only one in the restaurant. The sandwiches are prepared to order, but this makes me wonder about the wait times during a busy lunch or dinner rush. However, this won't stop me from coming back, as there are other sandwiches on the menu that I'm intrigued by and would like to try."}
{"text":"patience...I think that's the main thing because everything is made to order.  after reading the reviews I decided to try their veggie sandwich ( basil fried tomato sandwich )...it was yum!  had their fries too..and another sandwich but I've forgotten what it was...lol...I've returned for the veggie sandwich because I found it more interesting than the meat sandwiches so far.   worth it if you like sandwiches..."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, and the owner is very nice and helpful.  I've never waited longer than 15 minutes for my order (though admittedly I avoid the lunch rush)"}
{"text":"The GOOD:  + the bread is fresh and crustly (crispy and crusty) + we ordered a fried fish and a fried tomato sandwich. I can not handle over-salted battered anything - it's not just unappealing, but not even sustainably edible, for me. Clubhouse's fried items were absolutely perfect to that effect, and highlighted the flavour of the ingredients marvelously. + The other ingredients were all very well balanced, and overall the two sandwiches didn't leave anything else to be desired.  the NOT AS GOOD  - it's hard to argue against the value of something that was delicious and satisfying. I will say that at that price point ($11 for the fish, $7 for the veggie) I would either get twice as much sandwich (I'm thinking submarine - obviously an inferior overall product, but undoubtedly you get more) or you get sides at the least.  the NEITHER  ~ We were there at a busy time, around 6:30pm, and because he works there by himself, or from what I've heard, one other person, it was a bit of a wait. We weren't in a terrible rush, and I was quite impressed there was one person back there doing everything. This wouldn't dissuade me from going back, but it's something to be aware of.  It's really hard to score - I'd say a 3.5 is more accurate. To sum - the sandwiches are terrific, and handmade with care. The price may be a touch high depending on what you value in your sandwich offerings. There may be a wait."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Unique sandwiches you wont find anywhere else. Would come down to the core just for these sandwiches."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times now. Last time, I got the pork chop sandwich and the boyfriend got a club. Both sandwiches were pretty tasty, but we were completely blown away by the fries. We seldom agree on fries, but we thought they were the best we had had in the city in a long time (like, a decade and more). It reminded us of the classic truck fries we used to get during our separate childhoods at the Harbourfront. Hot, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside -- the description that so many fries aspire to at all burger and fish/chip joints but very, very seldom get right.  This time, I got a fried turkey sandwich with a cranberry/something slaw and a special mayo and he got the meatball special. Fries were still amazing. The fried turkey sandwich was fantastic -- crispy, and incredibly moist and tender meat. I had never had better turkey, and the BF thought it was even better than fried chicken because the turkey has a more interesting flavour.   I also ordered a salad, and it was a really nice mixed salad with fruit and vegetables. Last time, the sandwich was plain and came in a box we got from the fridge, which was probably the least impressive part of our first visit. This time, it was served in a bowl, hand-mixed, and came with a vinaigrette that seemed to be prepped on the spot (not sure). I mean, damn. Much better.  The sandwich was so much (turkey, breading, fried, ciabatta bun) that I couldn't finish it -- just half. Next time, we figure we'll order the fried turkey sandwich (if they're still serving) between us, and then one side each. To make it a sandwich, side, and drink combo, you add $4. So it's not dirt cheap, but it's really good value for what you get.   Only complaint was that the eating counter was kind of sticky. And in the winter, there's really no shielding you from the cold wind that blows in when the door opens -- a problem a LOT of Toronto places have. Otherwise, it's a simple but appealing space, the service is bare-bones but effective and friendly, and the food is really good."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ. This place. I'm not religious, but if they served these sandwiches at a church, I'd ask to be baptised. I already come here at least once a week.  The sandwiches: My favourite sandwiches are the turkey and the smoked chicken. The fried tomato (completely vegetarian) is amazing too. These are not mere sandwiches. They can easily fuel you for five-six hours. Especially the turkey.  The fries: I don't know how the chef makes his fries, but damn, the crispy salty potato skin on them is to die for.  The soup: I'm not a huge fan of soups in general, but I was a bit under the weather the other day, and I had a bowl of the leek and potato soup and that stuff got me rolling again, so there's that. As good as everything else, which is to say, pretty damn good.  Don't just try this place. Make it part of your routine."}
{"text":"Price point tilted this from a 3...12 bucks for fries water and huge sandwich seems like a great deal.  The place is cute small and was busy. Lots of signage to let you know this isn't fast food.  Great chalkboard menu with a number of tasty choices.  Wouldn't mind a option for different buns but thats a quibble.  The sandwich was huge and these are giant fries...well beyond thick cut style. But cooked well. I'd go back."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this restaurant, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot. I had the flank steak sandwich and she had the fried calamari sandwich. Both took time to prepare but its well worth it.  The food was fresh, the toppings were unique and plentiful, and the service was great. The prices are a little high but worth it IMO. We also split some fries which were surprisingly incredible. I'd go here just for those.  After ordering, a few more customers came in and ordered (what I believe to be their most popular dish) turkey sandwich. It was huge and looked fantastic. Although the flank steak sandwich was great, turkey town looks like the place to be next time I try this place out."}
{"text":"I love this place. I try to come by whenever I'm in the area. The Fried Tomato sandwich is perfect every time. Best fries I've ever had, too.  Minus one star for cleanliness, but the food is incredible."}
{"text":"Y'all been sleeping on this place. The sandwiches here are cheap for Toronto, the sandwiches themselves are delicious and its proximity to u of t make it a must for any student."}
{"text":"I get the tomato sandwich every now and again from The Clubhouse. I like the sandwich. But, today was the second time that I've been burned by excessive wait times. I came in at 12:30 and ordered the sandwich. There was no line in front of me and the restaurant was 3/4 full. The clerk gave no indication that the wait would be long. Apparently there were a lot of phone/app orders because I didn't end up getting my sandwich until after 1:00 and only after I complained, saying that I needed to just leave for a class at 1:10. I got my sandwich but had to eat it cold after the class. I suppose the answer is to order by phone. It even seems that if you walk in off the street you should just call them on the phone from inside their shop."}
{"text":"Pro- Quality sandwiches  Employee (owner?) friendly  Con- Expensive  Slow (hire someone for the counter, 3 potential customers walked out after waiting too long)  Walls and counters need A REALLY good scrub/cleaning l"}
{"text":"It's about time UofT got an awesome go-to lunch spot.  The sandwiches here are really unique and special. My personal favourite is the steak sandwich ($9) which has freshly cooked medium-rare/medium flank steak and braised cabbage, pesto, and nuts. The bun is just slightly toasted so it has this really nice char flavour to it.   Oh, and the fries. Made from Russet potatoes, they are thick, super crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. Make sure you try them!  So happy this place opened during my last year at UofT. A sandwich and fries will keep you full for almost the entire day."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times because it's so close to UofT and every time the sandwiches keep getting better and better!!  They seem to have hired more staff in the kitchen since they started but it's still a bit of a wait for the food.  It gets crowded fast during lunch time, so go a bit before or a bit after the lunch rush!!"}
{"text":"I looked forward coming here, but now I'm a bit torn.  I like the concept, freshly made sandwiches...service was a bit meh, asked the girl if my sandwich came any sauce and I was directed to read the menu...  Thought it was a piece of steak but it was chopped up...my fault, I should have looked at the pics...  The sandwich was awful, the bun was the best part...didn't like the spicy cashew (chex mix) on top. I'm not one to like sauces so I asked for the pesto sauce on the side. It smelled good but it wasn't a combination that was for me."}
{"text":"I have had almost every sandwich on the menu, and most of the specials. The cooks here are honestly geniuses - everything is delicious and amazingly executed. The vegetarian options are not inferior to the meat at all, which is refreshing. I would eat lunch here every day if I could.  Their salads and fries aren't an afterthought either - the salad is an inventive mixture of vegetables and appropriate fruit and they have created the ideal vinaigrette, IMO. The french fries are triple fried and are the best in the city.  The main guy working here is super fun to talk to as well.   Service can be a bit slow if you go during lunch rush, but otherwise is great."}
{"text":"A generous portion of meats in a crusty bun. Rich and juicy with a nice complement of flavours for under $10. A blast for lunch especially.  I've had the smoked vietnamese pork, which is nicely reminiscent of a hearty banh mi; marinated grilled pork chop, which has tender bites of pork with caramelized onions, tangy herb aioli, and a crunchy pork 'crackalackin'; and the smoked chicken, which had great chicken and the pleasant surprise of fried avocado. All were fantastic.  Takes a while though so order online, otherwise be ready for a 20 minute wait at the cashier. Ritual makes things super easy!"}
{"text":"Generous amounts of meat and every other ingredient on a both soft and crusty bun that just melts and mixes in your mouth to form the ultimate most delicious mouthly concoction. Hands down one of the best sandwich joints in town!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are pretty decent.  Good quality ingredients, individually made at slightly high-ish prices.  The chef and I have a difference of opinion on the use of salt.  I think I salt my food a lot, but he's basically pushing my limits.  Maybe it's a strategy to get me to buy a drink?  3.5-4 stars for the food.  The reason I don't eat here often?  They're always understaffed at lunch time.  Please bring in someone part time to help with the lunch rush.  I just can't have a surprise 25 minute wait for a sandwich...if I wanted that I'd go to a sit-down place.   Minus 1 star for the long waits.  Staff are sort-of-friendly, sort-of-frazzled, sort-of-umm...odd?  Weird vibe every single time."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich places I've ever found. ~$10 for a sandwich, $4 for fries. Best value for your dollar in the city imo. Sandwiches are delicious, have very unique (but not excessive) flavour, portioned large, and are cheap relative to Toronto prices. Fries are great too.  I've tried all the sandwiches on the menu. Popular ones are Pork, Steak, and Turkey. Veg option: fried tomato. My favourite is the calamari, (comes with honey roasted tomatoes and tzatzki sauce)  Only piece of warning is to call ahead and order by phone. Line up can be long, especially at lunch time. Otherwise, this is my most recommended Toronto restaurant, and I've eaten here countless times in the year or two since I've discovered it."}
{"text":"Excellent mixture of taste and flavour. The bread used for their sandwich was very soft and medium hard crusted, so no struggling to chew off each bite.   I ordered two cheapest selections on the menu - Smoked chicken & marinated pork chop - and I have to say that for a $7.25/ea deal, it was very filling and satisfying.   The only drawback is that all the ingredients are cooked and cut when ordered which means that preparation time for two sandwiches was about 7 minutes in total. (I only noticed because I was in a rush to get back to my office. I made it back to the office in time to devour both sandwiches with my lunch date.)  It was genuinely the best value for the price, taste, and ...yeah, I think you get it. Try one."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Ever since we ordered their sandwiches for our team lunch, our company has been hooked. My personal fav is the chicken one but a tip I'd like to give everyone is that you MUST get their triple deep fried French fries fried in peanut oil. Fries are super crispy and full of flavour. It's like crack for the people at our office.. The moment we smell it, everyone is drawn towards it and has to get their hands on some.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the wait for your sandwich can be a bit long (20 mins or so) because they are pretty short staffed. Their fries can be a bit inconsistent in terms of crispiness at times too. Nonetheless still a great place to go for lunch!"}
{"text":"A well deserved 4.5 stars.  Clubhouse Sandwiches is a popular joint not just for U of T students, but business workers as well. There's a good mix of people who were eating here during my stay, and I can tell this place will survive very well (as evident with all the positive reviews here).  It took me a while to decide what to order, but I went with the marinated grilled pork chop sandwich, along with the soup of the day. The soup of the day was clam chowder, which came in a rather larger bowl than I expected. It actually tasted very good, and I actually think it was one of the more underrated aspects of this shop.   The sandwich took quite long to arrive (~15-20 minutes), but it was worth the wait. The pork chop was perfectly grilled (NOT fried!!!), and the herb and carmalized onions were an excellent addition to the sandwich. The size was perfect as well for the amount I paid (~$8, $10 with the soup).  I was tempted to order the fries as they looked so delicious, but I was too full to order them. The potatoes are big though, similar to TLP Sandwiches on Elm Street!  This was definitely an excellent recommendation from one of my UT friends, and I will spread the word around for folks who I know work/study in the area."}
{"text":"Update on my last review: The Vietnamese Pork is a very delicious alternative if you're not in the chicken mood.   Also, don't miss the Poutine!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the fried oyster special with fries. Super friendly down to earth people. The guy who opened up the place came and chatted for a bit. Found this place by using the Cheap Chomp app that  promotes daily specials for cheap food #cheapchomp"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I've only tried half the sandwiches on the menu. The chicken parm (crispy; lots of (white) meat for the price; a great, thick tomato sauce) and Vietnamese pork (salty smoked pork, flavourful XO mayo, a bit of pickled goodbess in the carrot) are favourites, but the marinated pork chop is decent, too. Fried tomato wasn't really my thing -- not enough flavour. Sandwiches take around ten minutes to come out, but you can call ahead with your order if you're in a rush.  Salads are pretty good -- lots of very fresh veg, including ones you wouldn't expect like beet and jicama. It's a slightly different salad every day and there's often a bit of fruit in it. Dressings are homemade and tasty. Try the basil one!  Atmosphere is average for a takeout joint, but a little dirty. They have Dry Sodas, San Pellegrino, Orangina, Coke, etc. and a big jug of water in the fridge.  I didn't know if I should give this place four or five stars, but the prices are good (all under $10 unless you get cashew pesto on the chicken parm), sandwiches I like here I really like and the salads are great, too. Go give these guys some money."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I used to work very close by and would drop by for lunch almost once a week. The wait times are long (because as they specify on their door sign--they are not fast food!) but if you call and order ahead, you can pick up in 15-20 minutes. My go-to is always the Vietnamese pork sandwich followed closely by the smoked chicken. The Viet pork is so savoury and mouth-watering delicious, with the pickled vegetables cutting through the creaminess perfectly. The seasoning is absolutely spot on, and portion sizes are very generous! Would definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"For those of you who don't like to read past the first sentence, let me begin by saying the following: it's a crime against humanity that as I was the only person eating here on a Saturday afternoon while Banh Mi Boys (which is certainly very good) probably had a line-up out the door.  The owner will tell first-timers to try the pork chop, and he is right! This would be a phenomenal sandwhich, even if it was more than $7. Moist and deliciously marinated, it also gets a little bit of a crunch from the house-made pork skin cracklings.  I got this with a side salad which came with a house-made citrus-mustard vinaigrette. When I asked the owner about the dressing, I was told he starts by reducing orange juice into a syrup and then ads his own grainy mustard.  If he puts that much effort into the salad dressing, imagine what goes into the sandwhiches!  Definitely going back and trying the Oyster Po' Boy."}
{"text":"Spadina' some best kept secret.  Sandwich here is addictive.  I found it on Yelp and I kept coming back.  The pork is flavourful - marinated Vietnamese Asian style.  And the bread is so soft and fluffy.   I ate the sandwich one bite after another. And before you know it, the sandwich is gone and I'm thinking when I can come back.  Highly recommended.  One caveat though..  Everything is made to order so it can get a lil slow.  Call ahead and get your order in to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"No people work here. Really hip interior design. Thenplace has seatig but not that much. And a communial table is my favourate. The sandwhiches are preaty freakin good. The ones that inhave had have been consistantly good. Its accross the cibs behing 7-11"}
{"text":"A standout gem among the run of the mill delis!!!  This quaint little shop is located just at the north east corner of Spadina and College where it is right beside Smoke's. Don't be fooled with plain looking facade and door - inside there beckons fabulous unique sandwiches. You'll get more than regular shave turkey or ham and cheese!  Since finding this place, I have been here three times over the last while so you can probably see that I am a big fan. I have tried their BBQ chicken, buttermilk fried turkey and vietnamese pork. So far - I can say you can't go wrong - all of them have been super tasty. The BBQ chicken has nice chunks of chicken with a sweet tangy BBQ sauce on a soft kaiser roll. The fried turkey was really big where it popped out of the bread. The pork sandwich reminded me of a sophisticated viet sub with smoky flavours, hints of cilandtro and mayo. The flavour profiles of all three hit the mark perfectly - some spice, heat and sweetness.   I would say the only downside is that place does get pretty busy. I would either try to call ahead for a pick-up order or come before/after the lunch rush. If you do drop in, you may have to wait a bit but the wait is definitely worth it ;). Just grab a drink and sit by the window to watch the people stroll by while your sandwich is made."}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious! I've tried both the grilled tomato and the halibut sandwiches and both were excellent! It does take a few minutes for your food to arrive, but it's absolutely worth it (You can sit by the window and people watch while you wait!). The staff was friendly and the inside was nicely laid out and very clean. Also, definitely try the fries, I think they may have been the best fries I've ever had. So great, I will be going back to try the other sandwiches (they had an oyster po boy that looked great, too!)..."}
{"text":"A fresh place for excellent sandwiches.  The owner is very friendly and the sandwiches are very tasty with Vietnamese and Chinese inspired flavours. It's small hidden gem at the corner of Spadina and College, near the 711 convenience store. Small seating area but great for groups of four. Excellent place for students during lunch time. Better than the food along College! A must try!"}
{"text":"i don't generally post, but i am a really big fan of this place.  today, i have had the calamari, and the chicken sandwich.   they were great.  Each bite has a lot of different flavours and textures going on.  you can tell that there is a lot of effort that goes into one of these sandwiches.  it is so great that i have told my family and friends about it."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places. Best fries in the city hands down (its the only place I won't get gravy or other sauces for) - triple fried in peanut oil. And the soups are very creative. I'm far from a vegetarian but the veggie sandwich is their best sandwich (~$7 for fried green tomatoes, arugula, avocado, goat cheese, roasted eggplant). Second place goes to their take on banh mi or the buttermilk fried turkey. I've tried every sandwich on the menu and they're all great, except for the calamari which gets washed with too much acid from the tomatoes. Without the tomatoes it pretty good."}
{"text":"This place looks unassuming from the outside but their food is great!   For under $10, it's a great pick for lunch. I had the chicken parm sandwich with fries on the side and I was stuffed. The sandwich was really fresh and flavourful. Their fries caught me off guard from the cut but were sooo good!   There's not a lot of seating inside as most people order it to go. I have no complaints about the wait time though I did notice people waiting for the food. Order on Ritual makes the process faster."}
{"text":"I had the fried turkey, steak, cod and calamari sandwiches (shared them of course!) Everything is fresh, turkey is fried to perfection, flavored are robust and explode in your mouth. Cod was flakey and fresh, bread tasted fresh out of a bakers oven. Note that they use peanut oil for everything, which I love because it tastes great and is healthy, however it may be an issue for those with peanut allergies. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Smoked Chicken sandwich and fries on UberEATS. The sandwich was fantastic- great portion of meat, just enough sauce for flavour without getting soggy and the fried avocado added a nice crunchy texture. The fries were ok, they're cut really chunky so they serve a bit soggier than I like them."}
{"text":"We came to Clubhouse after seeing it on You Gotta Eat Here. I probably would have never known it existed if it weren't for the show because it's in a kinda odd corner of College & Spadina.   We ordered the smoked pork and the smoked chicken sandwiches with one order of fries and a coke, all for $20, which I was happy to pay for two of us to leave with full tummies.   The boyf preferred the pork sandwich, which is basically a banh mi on a kaiser roll. The meat and the mayo were flavorful, but I thought the bread wasn't quite right for the sandwich. The smoked chicken was great!  The fried avocado balls could have used a touch more salt, but they were an amazing, crunchy addition, and even though the bun was the same on both sandwiches, it seemed to fit the chicken better than the pork.  I am obsessed with fries and they did not disappoint, but I wish they had come with a sauce other than packaged Heinz ketchup... for a place that does so many condiments so well, they should offer these with the fries."}
