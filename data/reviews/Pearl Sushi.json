{"text":"After coming here for a year I am breaking up with Pearl Sushi. While the food and prices are ok the service is the WORST. 
I've called regularily for pick-up and delivery in the past and while they are never nice on the phone, it's quickly gone downhill. 
Last time I called for delivery he answered and said immeidatly \"Email me order\". I was taken aback and said but I have you on the phone now. He groaned and said have we delivered to you before and I said yes. He then took my address and after a minute said \"I can't find you, just email me order ok?\" I responded that he already had my address at this point and I was ordering one thing, and I didn't have his email. At this point of wasting time he could have had my order taken already. He groaned again and said hold on. I hung up. He then called me back 3 times.
I understand he may be busy, and overworked but he only has a business because of clients. Acting put out because I want to place an order is ridiculous. 
Never again!"}
{"text":"Get sushi here if you're into gooooood sushi for a good price. Don't expect to be able to sit there (seems to be take out only). Called once, loved it. After that, they remember my usual order every time and it's always amazing. Everything is good, but the Salmon's Lover B is crazy good!"}
{"text":"WAY overpriced; I've had cheaper and MUCH better at any downtown Japanese restaurant.  Their traditional/basic salad, well, sucks.  What the hell is in that dressing?!  The fish itself is not fresh,the menu selection is minimal, the wait is way too long for such an under-patroinized take-out restaurant, and the portion sizes are very tiny (even for maki/sushi).  Mimico is very underserviced for delivery and/or decent restaurants, but this does not excuse the quality of Pearl Sushi.  (One would be better off buying the pre-made sushi/maki at the Metro gorcery store at Kipling and Queenway.)"}
{"text":"Used to live downtown and frequented the many local sushi restaurants. Moved out to Mimico, this place is near by. Service is excellent here. Consistent sushi, very reasonable prices. I've eaten here a lot, dont expect wildly exotic sushi here. It's a very small place with a limited menu but what they do make, they make extremely well."}
{"text":"Went to Pearl Sushi last week to try it out was disappointed. The rice was mushy. Tried again  this week thinking it was just me. But again rice is mushy."}
{"text":"Have been going here for over two years and it is by far and away the best sushi in the city. If you aren't looking for a sit down restaurant and just want good, high quality sushi this is your place. 

Service is prompt and polite. No BS with our order and the guys hustle make everything come together on busy days. 

Fish is always fresh and the artistry is evident in every creation. Rolls stay tight and together even after you get home. 

Favourite entries are dragon rolls, salmon lovers combo and the spicy tuna or salmon rolls. 

Keep up the great work and the customers will never end!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect from this tiny place, but it was delicious!  The rolls were fresh and a perfect size. Excited to have pearl sushi in Mimico!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent prices. After going to more than a dozen Sushi places in the past year, Pearl Sushi is by far the best. Very high quality. Also their miso soup is very good!"}
{"text":"Great for take out sushi on that lazy mid-week evening. The menu is affordable and the service is Excellent! The salmon platter is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish and friendly service. The sushi was priced fairly but nothing out of the ordinary. Maki pieces were fairly small but tasty. Tried 5 different types of maki, the volcano roll was the best of the lot but make sure you pay extra to get it spicy. Was a little surprised it was such a small shop only suitable for takeout. I will go back but it won't be a regular stop for me in mimico."}
{"text":"What a great little sushi spot.  Perfect for take out.  The fish is always fresh and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Just don't arrive before it's ready for pick-up...

The quality is totally worth the added cost, and they invest into the food, not the shop. We ordered from here over a year ago and just haven't had the push to return as the general atmosphere threw us off quite a lot. It's not an eat-in place, but even the 5-minute wait for our meal made us question returning."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars because the fish did not taste very fresh to me. However, in all other things it was a 4 star joint, and hopefully it was just a bad day for fish!

I called to make an order for pick up. This place was prompt. I was earlier than 15 mins, but they were ready for me. The rice ratio of the rolls were spot on. And the taste of the rolls, other than the fish, was quite good.

It's really very small and meant as a take out spot based off of space. I would be inclined to try them out again, but the taste of the fish was disappointing."}
{"text":"I order from here at least once a week.
The sushi here is always fresh and the presentation is very nice.
Prices are very reasonable for sushi as well.
I always get the Everyday Special #7. Lots of sushi for a great price!"}
{"text":"This food and service here is excellent. I moved to Etobicoke from DT about 6 months ago, and this has become my go-to place for EXCELLENT, fresh, and very well priced Jap fare. 

I have tried many in the area, which have not compared to Pearl Sushi. 

The disappointment at these other places such as Tokyo Sushi on The Queensway, after such bad quality food and feeling ripped off, have left me being solely committed to this place. 

Although there is only one table to eat at, and for summer an outdoor picnic table,  will seat 2 people inside and up to 6 outside in summer.

It's great for take out and they also deliver. 

For around $12, I get a special that includes soup, salad, and 3 maki rolls: a spicy salmon roll, a dynamite roll, and a California roll. You tell me of another place that can beat that price, with the quality this guy provides.!!

Also I have had the LA beef ribs here, as an appetizer and as part of a bento box, and its great quality of beef, not fatty, and juicy and tender. 

The only thing I would suggest they do different is use LESS batter for the tempuras. Too much breading takes away from it for me. 

It's a family, father and son business, and the service has always been very kind and fast, and the son remembered my name from the 3rd time I went in. 

I have NEVER  had  fish here that wasn't fresh, or had bad inconsistent food here.

 I have eaten here roughly  10-15 times including delivery in the last 6 months (I love Jap)

ALSO for party platters, if you are working on a budget, he will whip together an assortment that is off the menu for you, you tell him what you like, and what you are looking to spend. and he will make it happen. So for around $40, expect to feed your whole family.

I highly recommend, and I've had Jap from places like Guu, Katsura, Wabora, Ki, to name a few.

{"text":"*Worst experience*

The most thinnest slices of sushi and sashimi you will ever see in your life. Small portion, EXPENSIVE (not worth what you pay for). Plus, the delivery guy will shout at you for more tip."}
{"text":"Worst delivery experience of my life: 
My boyfriend and I ordered from Pearl Sushi two days in a row, the first day we waited out front while they made the food and we picked it up and took it home. I tipped them then, and in all honesty, I confused myself as to why I tipped for them doing their job, especially when it was $50 for the meal. We ordered again tonight and they are a 45 second drive from our apartment, after we paid for the meal (another $50) we decided not to tip - which is our right, and as a former server, I've experienced people who exercise that right before as well. I was completely shocked at what happened next. The delivery driver knocked a few times on our door, then proceeded to OPEN MY APARTMENT DOOR AND TRY TO WALK IN!! He was demanding a tip from us and actually refused to leave until we have him one. I told him I would not tip if he was going to ask for one, and he was still refusing to leave. We had no cash so he eventually left, but I have never experienced such rude and inappropriate behaviour in all my life. The restaurant is a 45 second drive, and they charge for delivery, so if I choose not to tip then I don't have to. I will NEVER order from them again, which is too bad for them since they are a take out and delivery only business, so to yell at your patrons for not tipping after they spent $50 on food that cost you $5 to make is completely unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the bad review was all about.  I've been coming here for over a year and their fish is always fresh.  The prices are reasonable, especially for Etobicoke where competitions are few.  Salmon Lover is my favourite - just the right amount of everything.  I usually put in my order, run across to get my groceries done and come back to pick up my order for the evening.

It does get slow during rush hour as it's a very small place and one guys does it all!"}
{"text":"I order takeout from here often, and they are quick to deliver.

The sushi is always fresh and presented nicely. It is above standard quality, and definitely worth the price! 

 In the summer my boyfriend and I like to take our food and eat by the lake :)"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST sushi place ever!

I moved to the neighbourhood 3 years ago, and I've been HOOKED ever since! They have the best food which I can't stay away from. I used to be so addicted I would get take-out 3 times a week. Right now I visit them once a week, but I get 2 large specialty rolls. :)

Pearl Sushi is easy to miss if you don't know where to look. It's across the street from Valu-Mart, on the right hand side from a coffee place. You can't really sit there, they just offer take-out, and OH MY, IT'S AMAZING! I don't have enough words to describe how great their sushi are.

My favourite ones are:
- Philadelphia roll (it's so good, you don't even need the soy sauce to enjoy the great taste)
- Sunday Morning roll (I think it's the only one that's deep-fried)
- Double Salmon roll (if you love salmon - this is for you!)
- Salmon lover A (includes salmon sushi, salmon maki and salmon sashimi)
- tuna maki and salmon maki
...I tried lost of other stuff, and it's all great, but those above are my favourite, so... Pick on your own! :)

I recommend calling and ordering for a pick-up. Your food is usually ready in 15-20 mins, unless it's Friday night. They have parking spots if you're driving. I think this business is family-owned, which is why you'll always see the same faces: the chef and the 2 sous chefs. Tip them well, as they almost jump out of their clothes to make your food. Also, if you happen to come without ordering and you're waiting, they will work extra fast to prepare your order.

The prices are reasonable. I'm sure you can find cheaper places in Toronto, but here you pay for the quality. For example, they charge $5 for tuna maki and $11 for Philadelphia roll - I think that's not expensive at all.
I think they raised the prices a little bit in the last year, but that was expected.

I would recommend Pearl Sushi to anyone who's willing to listen to me. I've been introduced to sushi around 10 years ago, I've tasted them in different cities and different countries, and trust me: these the THE BEST ONES!"}
{"text":"I have no problem with Pearl Sushi - it's a great weeknight take-out sushi joint.  The fish is always pretty fresh, albeit, a little pricy for Mimico.  Sometimes the wait it long because it's just two people working in there and it's very small but, all in all, good local sushi place."}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout from Pearl Sushi for the first time and really enjoyed it! I ordered the combo that comes with California Rolls, Spicy Salmon and a Dynamite Roll ($13) and my fiancé ordered the Dynamite Roll and Sushi and Sashimi combo ($15). Both also came with miso soup. The rice was really tasty with a slight sweet stickiness to it. There was slightly more rice than ingredients in the ratios but I didn't mind this since I was hungry :)

Overall everything was great, value was excellent, I'm stuffed now but will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I thought the taste was overall good. Some of the fish didn't taste too fresh. 

I did however have a severe case of food poisoning after eating there. 

I hope they take better care in preparing their food as the other reviews seem overall positive."}
{"text":"Best sushi for the best price in Toronto with very good service. Everything is always fresh, pearl sushi is number 1 !!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! I have been going here since they opened and they have grown quite a fan base. I only ever get or eat their salmon items so I can't speak for the whole menu, but I've never been dissatisfied. Sashimi is always thick and melts in my mouths, rolls have a nice crunch and rice is perfect. I used to ask the chef to thrown in some avocado in my rolls, and he was sweet enough to give it to me without charge. Very friendly staff and clearly family owned and operated. Don't expect to sit and eat here though, only one table available: but you're by the waterfront so it's not a huge loss."}
{"text":"Great roll
Not too much rice
Very accommodating I made up a roll of avocado salmon and tuna they did it and it was awesome"}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy maybe my taste buds were doll that day but everything tasted bland. Especially the salmon. Didn't seem fresh. In fact, I felt sick to my stomach shortly after eating. Even the dynamite roll, a simple common dish, was poor quality"}
