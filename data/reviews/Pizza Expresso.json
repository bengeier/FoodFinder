{"text":"Crust was soggy even though the pie was lacking in sauce. It was too thick, and the rest of the ingredients were lost, though were of good quality. The taste of the crust was good however. so if you like your pizza crust on the soft and doughy side, its an ok pizza."}
{"text":"The poutine was wonderfully  messy and definitely satisfied my evening cravings. I didn't care too much for the mozzarella that was on top, but I did like gravy."}
{"text":"Order from here quite often. Food is usually good but honestly depends on the night. We usually love the poutine!  Sometimes they use different fries (mccains)which is disappointing. But they are open late so very convenient.  highly recommend prices are super cheap"}
{"text":"English is a beautiful language. Cheap can mean either 1) low cost, and 2) low in quality. In this case, we have both forms. Dollar cheese slices, $5 gyro, $3.50 (not so) small poutine. Good deal? Well not if the food is gross.   Meat lovers pizza had fake bacon on it, and although hot, just had no taste. As for the poutine, fries were \"mccaine\", gravy was chemical orange, and the cheese was a mix of half-frozen curds and shredded mozzarella. Barely passable.   On a budget, or late night after a night of drinking, it'll do. Just expect cheap both ways."}
{"text":"Everything was good from this little spot.  Minus the feta I don't know why I ordered it but I did. My gyro had no tzatki so that sucked.   Open late and came quick"}
{"text":"We order delivery from here frequently. Efficient quick delivery n service (~40mins). Cheap prices, pizza' s pretty good (good sauce, good dough, good portion of cheese n toppings) i would recommend asking for extra sauce though 'cuz it's good and the last 3 times we ordered there wasn't enough sauce we found. Poutine was pretty good n saucy for a bbq-sauce/mozzarella poutine (vs brown gravy n cheese curds like it should be...). Chicken wings were good n crispy but unfortunately EXTREMELY bland. We'll probably just stick to pizza from them and the occasional poutine if we're really craving poutine but yah good for the dollar!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 for one and the Hawaiian with extra ham. I would honestly recommend just ordering dominoes cuz at least when you order extra with them it actually shows up.   The crust is inedible, and the pizza itself is not good. Just buy a frozen pizza. I regret not just ordering dominoes."}
