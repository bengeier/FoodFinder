{"text":"Come here for the games, but not the food.   The games are great and they have a huge variety of them. The staff is super friendly and make great game recommendations accoding to your preference and the number of people at your table.   The food is not super good, so don't expect to have a delicious meal there.   Overall, it's a great place to have fun with friends."}
{"text":"Randolphs was so much fun. I went with my boyfriend and apartment mate for a few drinks, some appetizers and, of course, games!  Even though it was a Friday night, we somehow got a table right away, however, expect to wait for table anytime after 7.  The 'game' servers were so nice and knew every game on the shelf. They even recommended a few games for us to play. Our favorite for the night was 'Funemployment'. We were dying laughing the entire time playing it.   The food was a little lack luster. We orders the Nachos and beef empanadas. This place is definitely a drink and game place."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to the original Randolph location on St-Denis you will know that there is always a line-up and it is insanely hard to get a seat, especially during busy periods like weekends.  That is why I was very happy to see a second location open up.  The new Randolph is on Beaubien and the entrance is actually on the cross street (des Ecores).  It is a bit of a walk from the metro which is definitely a downside but if you are driving parking around here is easier than at their other location and free.  This location feels way more spacious than the other one which I really like.  There is also a pool table and seating at the bar area.  Since it is newer the interior definitely feels more updated and modern.    The bar operates exactly like the original location.  You pay the $5 fee and that allows you to stay and play all the games you want.  They do have a great selection of games so regardless of what you like playing you should be able to find something that suits your needs.  They have consultants on hand to make recommendations if you don't know what you feel like playing and of course there is food and drink.    Now onto the other important part: the crowds.  Like I said before the original Randolph gets packed quickly and it is not uncommon to see a huge line-up in front of it on any given night.  This location gets busy but it doesn't seem to be as bad.  I was here on a Saturday night and while it was a full house it seems people didn't have to wait long as there was only a handful of people waiting at any given time.  It also looks like they take reservations which is something they don't do at the other location but double check this because I could be mistaken.  I was so happy to see Randolph's expand because it is a fun place but it can be hard to get into.  This location is just as awesome as the first one if not better and it doesn't seem as hard to get a table (yet).  I'm looking forward to coming back here many more times in the future!"}
